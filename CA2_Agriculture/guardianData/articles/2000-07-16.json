The bank is in the process of selling its head office, which incorporates the celebrated 221b Baker Street address of the fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. </p> <p>The process is not expected to be a precursor to large scale closures in the 765-branch operation. </p> <p>The decision to consider selling off the hole-in-the-wall machines is understood to have been prompted by the industry trend to axe all charges for use the machines. </p> <p>Abbey is one of the banks which had been hoping to charge its rivals' customers \u00a31 a time when they used Abbey machines as of January 1 2002. In return it intended to drop the disloyalty fee it levies on its customers when they use a rival's machines. </p> <p>The idea of selling the machines, which is thought to be at an early stage, might take the form of offloading them on to a third party provider such as Securicor or Money Box and then securing some arrangement whereby Abbey customers would have preferential terms when they used the machines. </p> <p>It is understood that a number of property developers have held talks with Abbey which issued a prospectus about its branches and properties a few weeks ago. The properties are expected to be worth in the region of \u00a3500m. </p> <p>Among the companies thought to be interested in taking on the idea are London &amp; Regional which is being backed by Morgan Stanley, and Mapeley, which has backing from George Soros.

      "bodyText": "Abbey National is considering selling off its cash machines and branch network, raising at least \u00a3500m in cash while cutting costs. Under the plan, the sale of the branches and other properties would involve Abbey's leasing them back for as long as 20 years. The bank is in the process of selling its head office, which incorporates the celebrated 221b Baker Street address of the fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. The process is not expected to be a precursor to large scale closures in the 765-branch operation. The decision to consider selling off the hole-in-the-wall machines is understood to have been prompted by the industry trend to axe all charges for use the machines. Abbey is one of the banks which had been hoping to charge its rivals' customers \u00a31 a time when they used Abbey machines as of January 1 2002. In return it intended to drop the disloyalty fee it levies on its customers when they use a rival's machines. The idea of selling the machines, which is thought to be at an early stage, might take the form of offloading them on to a third party provider such as Securicor or Money Box and then securing some arrangement whereby Abbey customers would have preferential terms when they used the machines. It is understood that a number of property developers have held talks with Abbey which issued a prospectus about its branches and properties a few weeks ago. The properties are expected to be worth in the region of \u00a3500m. Among the companies thought to be interested in taking on the idea are London &amp; Regional which is being backed by Morgan Stanley, and Mapeley, which has backing from George Soros. Other companies which have also talked to Abbey include Trilliun and Nomura.",

It helps concentrate the players' minds on their work, which is all about short passing and good movement, not hitting the ball long or in the air. </p> <p>So this week it's Clairfontaine, the French Football Federation's exclusive training complex. As well as the fantastic facilities available, he feels it will give our players a psychological lift to use the same base as the likes of Zidane et al. </p> <p>Don't think of Lilleshall or Bisham Abbey.

      "body": "<p>The beginning of the end of the Edwards era at Manchester United could see the world's richest club abandon its cautious salaries policy in order to recruit some of the game's biggest names - and hold on to stars such as David Beckham they already have. </p> <p>Martin Edwards's anticipated resignation tomorrow as the club's chief executive will leave his successor - Peter Kenyon, currently his deputy - to deal with two problems, both of which involve spending huge sums of money or risk losing out to Italian and Spanish rivals in the race for top talent. </p> <p>First, there is United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's highly-public frustra tion at his inability to lure truly world-class players to Old Trafford because United will not meet their financial demands. Only last week he admitted that Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and their ilk would never move to Manchester because they are 'out of our financial reach. It annoys you at times'. </p> <p>Second, and arguably more urgently, Kenyon and the United board will have to decide whether to break the club's famously-strict wage structure - formulated and maintained by Edwards, and which almost led to Roy Keane's departure - simply to ensure that homegrown stars like Beckham and Paul Scholes will resist the huge financial packages likely to be dangled in front of them sooner or later by Inter, AC Milan and other European superclubs. </p> <p>Edwards is likely to remain as both chairman of the football club and a major shareholder, at least in the short term.

      "bodyText": "The beginning of the end of the Edwards era at Manchester United could see the world's richest club abandon its cautious salaries policy in order to recruit some of the game's biggest names - and hold on to stars such as David Beckham they already have. Martin Edwards's anticipated resignation tomorrow as the club's chief executive will leave his successor - Peter Kenyon, currently his deputy - to deal with two problems, both of which involve spending huge sums of money or risk losing out to Italian and Spanish rivals in the race for top talent. First, there is United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's highly-public frustra tion at his inability to lure truly world-class players to Old Trafford because United will not meet their financial demands. Only last week he admitted that Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and their ilk would never move to Manchester because they are 'out of our financial reach. It annoys you at times'. Second, and arguably more urgently, Kenyon and the United board will have to decide whether to break the club's famously-strict wage structure - formulated and maintained by Edwards, and which almost led to Roy Keane's departure - simply to ensure that homegrown stars like Beckham and Paul Scholes will resist the huge financial packages likely to be dangled in front of them sooner or later by Inter, AC Milan and other European superclubs. Edwards is likely to remain as both chairman of the football club and a major shareholder, at least in the short term. But his power and influence will both be greatly diminished, while Kenyon and Sir Roland Smith, chairman of United's plc arm, will drive the club forward. In the longer term, Edwards will probably sell his 6.5 per cent stake, resign from any positions at Old Trafford and cut all links with the club he inherited on his father Louis's death in 1980. Louis Edwards, a Manchester butcher, became a United director the day after the 1958 Munich air crash.

      "body": "<p>Who says draws are boring? A day of wild fluctuations ended with Glen Chapple, Chris Schofield and Mike Smethurst adding 93 in 33 absorbing overs for Lancashire's last two wickets to avert apparently inevitable defeat. In the process they preserved the only unbeaten record in the First Division and securing four precious points that nudged them ahead of Yorkshire in the table. </p> <p>Chapple and Schofield came together just before tea with Lancashire 324 for eight, two runs behind, after a collapse in which five wickets tumbled inside five overs. Even when they were parted, Schofield bowled by a slower ball from Graham Rose, Lancashire were only 54 ahead with 18 overs remaining. </p> <p>Smethurst joined Chapple to frustrate Somerset for a further 12 overs until the home captain Jamie Cox accepted the draw with six overs remaining. Lancashire celebrated as if they had won a one-day final. </p> <p>The draw had looked inevitable when John Crawley and Sourav Ganguly were adding 151 with complete authority for Lancashire's fourth wicket.

A day of wild fluctuations ended with Glen Chapple, Chris Schofield and Mike Smethurst adding 93 in 33 absorbing overs for Lancashire's last two wickets to avert apparently inevitable defeat. In the process they preserved the only unbeaten record in the First Division and securing four precious points that nudged them ahead of Yorkshire in the table. Chapple and Schofield came together just before tea with Lancashire 324 for eight, two runs behind, after a collapse in which five wickets tumbled inside five overs. Even when they were parted, Schofield bowled by a slower ball from Graham Rose, Lancashire were only 54 ahead with 18 overs remaining. Smethurst joined Chapple to frustrate Somerset for a further 12 overs until the home captain Jamie Cox accepted the draw with six overs remaining. Lancashire celebrated as if they had won a one-day final. The draw had looked inevitable when John Crawley and Sourav Ganguly were adding 151 with complete authority for Lancashire's fourth wicket. Crawley, 68 overnight, grafted to his first championship century of a lean summer from 261 balls, and Ganguly was on course for a repeat of the 183 he scored here for India in the World Cup last year. Then Cox surprisingly gave the second new ball to Michael Burns, who arrived from Warwickshire as a wicketkeeper three years ago but now bowls occasional medium pace.

In county cricket it is sufficient to acquire the greatest living spin bowler, an England international paceman and a high profile coach for a season. </p> <p>Hampshire, bolstered by some private money, took the plunge last year. In swift succession they signed up Shane Warne, Alan Mullally and coach Jimmy Cook. They are still awaiting the dividend on their investments. Currently Hampshire are bottom in the First Division of the Championship table (one win) and also bottom of Division Two in the one day league (one win). Their sole consolation is that they are still in the NatWest Trophy - in the quarter finals they play Middlesex in ten days' time. A victory there would, at least, delay their end of season party. </p> <p>Barring a surge to the NatWest final Hampshire will struggle to make their books balance this year. They have been unfortunate. When they signed Alan Mullally they probably anticipated that he would have a central contract, which would have meant that the bulk of his hefty salary (by cricketing standards) would have been met by the ECB. </p> <p>But Mullally was not one of the chosen twelve. Then he was injured at the start of the season. Once he recovered fitness, he took a few wickets for his new county and almost immediately was drafted into England's one day squad, which has, again, denied Hampshire of his services. </p> <p>In a summer singularly unsuited to wrist spin bowling, Shane Warne has been unable so far to make a great impact, though not through any lack of effort. Warne may be exasperated that he finds himself repeatedly striding to the wicket with the score at 100 for seven; he won't have enjoyed four consecutive ducks at the start of his county career especially when his avowed intention was to score a maiden first class hundred in England. But by all accounts he's trying his socks off and doing his utmost to help the others. </p> <p>However he's not often had to bowl in a situation where his side has already surrendered a first innings lead (very rarely for Australia, occasionally for Victoria, but regularly for Hampshire). Moreover his old shoulder injuries prevent the ball from zipping out with quite the same venom as it did before; he has to rely more on guile, flight and reputation now. Reputation counts for little and Warne becomes a mortal bowler when the opposition are already 100 in front. And they usually have been when Hampshire are in the field this summer. </p> <p>It has of course been consistently damp and seamer friendly throughout this season. Leg spin, so far, has been a luxury. Warne has started to take his quota of wickets (he has 40 in nine Championship matches) but spare a thought for Chris Schofield, England contracted, a Test debutant, yet omitted by Lancashire when they played at Derby recently. It's mildly surprising to me that no one has attempted to loan him (the loan system was introduced this year but so far not a single county has decided to use it). The problem is who do you approach for permission, Lancashire or the ECB? </p> <p>In these conditions it is Hampshire's woeful batting that has scuppered all the early season optimism. Robin Smith failed to score a 100 last year but he passed 50 ten times. This summer it's an almighty struggle to get to 50. He averages 19 and there are concerns that in his thirty-seventh year Hampshire's most feared batsman has 'hit the wall'. There comes a time in every cricketer's life when the eyes, feet and hands don't coordinate as they used to. Only Giles White and Will Kendall, their season's sole centurion, average above thirty. The rest, most of whom are relatively inexperienced, have had their confidence shattered by seaming pitches and a backlog of failures. What are Hampshire to do? Reach for the cheque book again? </p> <p>That would, no doubt, be the response in the world of football, where financial clout is everything. We can nominate the top five of next season's Premiership with certainty by looking at a club's bank balances. It is all too predictable. Thankfully cricket has not reached that stage - yet. Wealth does not necessarily translate to cricketing health. </p> <p>Look at the recent trophy holders. Gloucestershire, the current one day demons, are a club of modest means; so too are Leicestershire, County Champions in 1996 and 1998, and Glamorgan, winners in 1997. But a shift in power is just discernible. At the halfway stage of the Championship the front-runners in Division One are the 'big boys' of Surrey, Yorkshire and Lancashire. They have deeper coffers than most, which comes from Test match status at their grounds. </p> <p>But to be fair to all three counties they haven't achieved their position by flashing their cheque books and recruiting cricketers from elsewhere. Apart from their invaluable overseas recruit, Saqlain Mushtaq, Surrey's only significant import has been Ian Salisbury, enticed from Sussex in 1997. Yorkshire's dalliance in the market has not been successful; in the recent past they recruited Richard Stemp (from Worcestershire) and Richard Harden (from Somerset) with little reward but their conveyor belt of home-grown pacemen has enabled them to challenge on a regular basis. Lancashire have a dubious Italian, Joe Scuderi, in their ranks. Otherwise the bulk of their team is home-grown. </p> <p>At the moment this is the only sure-fire way to success. Find your own players, nurture them and occasionally top them up with the odd carefully selected recruit. As Hampshire have discovered, a spectacular spending spree is not enough if the base of home-grown talent is inadequate. Whether this will remain the same in the future is open to question. Two factors increase the likelihood of a soccer-style system, in which financial clout prevails, overtaking county cricket. First the introduction of two divisions may prompt players with ambition, who are stuck in the bottom division, to move on. Secondly and more importantly the restrictions on players' movement have been relaxed - the Players' Association would have alerted their lawyers otherwise. Now any player over 25 is entitled to change clubs once his contract is up. There is fresh scope for money to start talking.</p>",

Warne has started to take his quota of wickets (he has 40 in nine Championship matches) but spare a thought for Chris Schofield, England contracted, a Test debutant, yet omitted by Lancashire when they played at Derby recently. It's mildly surprising to me that no one has attempted to loan him (the loan system was introduced this year but so far not a single county has decided to use it). The problem is who do you approach for permission, Lancashire or the ECB? In these conditions it is Hampshire's woeful batting that has scuppered all the early season optimism. Robin Smith failed to score a 100 last year but he passed 50 ten times. This summer it's an almighty struggle to get to 50. He averages 19 and there are concerns that in his thirty-seventh year Hampshire's most feared batsman has 'hit the wall'. There comes a time in every cricketer's life when the eyes, feet and hands don't coordinate as they used to. Only Giles White and Will Kendall, their season's sole centurion, average above thirty. The rest, most of whom are relatively inexperienced, have had their confidence shattered by seaming pitches and a backlog of failures. What are Hampshire to do? Reach for the cheque book again? That would, no doubt, be the response in the world of football, where financial clout is everything. We can nominate the top five of next season's Premiership with certainty by looking at a club's bank balances. It is all too predictable. Thankfully cricket has not reached that stage - yet. Wealth does not necessarily translate to cricketing health. Look at the recent trophy holders. Gloucestershire, the current one day demons, are a club of modest means; so too are Leicestershire, County Champions in 1996 and 1998, and Glamorgan, winners in 1997. But a shift in power is just discernible. At the halfway stage of the Championship the front-runners in Division One are the 'big boys' of Surrey, Yorkshire and Lancashire. They have deeper coffers than most, which comes from Test match status at their grounds. But to be fair to all three counties they haven't achieved their position by flashing their cheque books and recruiting cricketers from elsewhere. Apart from their invaluable overseas recruit, Saqlain Mushtaq, Surrey's only significant import has been Ian Salisbury, enticed from Sussex in 1997. Yorkshire's dalliance in the market has not been successful; in the recent past they recruited Richard Stemp (from Worcestershire) and Richard Harden (from Somerset) with little reward but their conveyor belt of home-grown pacemen has enabled them to challenge on a regular basis. Lancashire have a dubious Italian, Joe Scuderi, in their ranks. Otherwise the bulk of their team is home-grown. At the moment this is the only sure-fire way to success. Find your own players, nurture them and occasionally top them up with the odd carefully selected recruit. As Hampshire have discovered, a spectacular spending spree is not enough if the base of home-grown talent is inadequate. Whether this will remain the same in the future is open to question. Two factors increase the likelihood of a soccer-style system, in which financial clout prevails, overtaking county cricket. First the introduction of two divisions may prompt players with ambition, who are stuck in the bottom division, to move on. Secondly and more importantly the restrictions on players' movement have been relaxed - the Players' Association would have alerted their lawyers otherwise. Now any player over 25 is entitled to change clubs once his contract is up. There is fresh scope for money to start talking.",

North-Eastern notables such as Peter Reid and Bobby Robson were there, spotted in earnest conversation in the plush seats, no doubt satisfied that England 'got a result'. And that unrelenting wind kept the rain away. </p> <p>Everyone seemed determined to enjoy themselves, but the cricket on offer was rarely as enthralling as the occasion demanded. Indeed we are still waiting for this triangular tournament to produce a cracker. Now we have to wait until the final. For England raced to a 10-wicket victory - their first in 314 one-day matches - with almost 15 overs to spare. This win all but guarantees that they will contest the final with Zimbabwe on Saturday. </p> <p>In the romp to victory Marcus Trescothick and Alec Stewart shredded the hapless West Indies' hide which had set them a paltry target. Trescothick displayed the relaxed command that he shows when he makes rare appearances for Keynsham in the Western League, finishing the match in style with a glorious six over mid-wicket. This week it has been an easy game for him. I think he's mature enough to recognise it won't always be like that. </p> <p>Before the game, doubts had been cast over the pitch here at the Riverside. Last week Nasser Hussain had wryly observed that he was intending to reintroduce his recently-broken thumb to the game in this match, intimating that this was the worst place in the world to come back after a hand injury. The pitch at Chester-le-Street is notoriously uneven. Yesterday Hussain took the discreet course; he was not ready to return. </p> <p>Meanwhile Nick Knight, Robert Croft and Vikram Solanki were despatched to their counties to play in the national league today, not what they anticipated since they - unlike Trescothick and Matthew Maynard - were original selections to the one-day squad. In fact, this pitch was perfectly reasonable. Yet West Indies could muster only 169 for eight from their 50 overs. The bounce was usually trustworthy, but the vast outfield was slow and the ghettoblaster man was rarely summoned into action - he turned on the music after every boundary, but there were only eleven of those in the tourists' innings. </p> <p>However the prime reason for West Indies' pedestrian progress was that England gave a superb display in the field. It was almost flawless until Alan Mullally, in the 49th over, failed to judge a swirling skier and was unable to lay a hand on the ball. </p> <p>So the killjoys were England and we can't complain about that. Obviously they are more adept at coping with wintry conditions than the tourists from the Caribbean. But yesterday they did more than cope in the field; they excelled. Their bowlers were uniformly disciplined and even though they lack one outstanding fieldsman, there were a couple of moments of magic in the outfield and very few errors. Brian Lara, who hit a subdued and sensible half-century, did his best. But if he was unable to break the stranglehold of the English bowlers, there was little chance his team-mates could. </p> <p>Realistically, West Indies had to win here to reach the final. This explains why they contemplated a pain-killing injection for Courtney Walsh to get him on the field despite his foot injury. In the end, sense prevailed and Walsh was absent. </p> <p>Stewart, unhesitatingly, chose to field and used the same system that was so successful in the high winds of Old Trafford on Thursday. Andrew Caddick and Mark Ealham dutifully ran into the wind; Darren Gough and Alan Mullally had it at their backs. Gough struck in his first over when Wavell Hinds, who had been promoted in the order, was lbw. </p> <p>Enter Lara - but this was not a day for swashbuckling. He batted responsibly, recognising that his team had to win and that at Chester-le-Street 200 just might be competitive. His first boundary and the first of the innings did not arrive until the thirteenth over and that was a lofted on-drive off Caddick. Now Mullally, so much more confident with a white ball than a red one, intervened. First Sherwin Campbell was taken at point from the shoulder of his bat and then Jimmy Adams was bowled off the inside edge. Lara and Chris Gayle carefully attempted to restore the innings. They were aided by the introduction of Trescothick, whose two covers cost 13. </p> <p>Trescothick's batting is a more handsome sight than his bowling, but he has been pressed into action as Andrew Flintoff is unable to bowl at the moment. Flintoff has dominated the back pages this week to herald the onset of the silly season. So I'll be brief. No doubt he's too heavy; but it would have been better for him if the England management's concerns had not been leaked. It was unpleasant to hear him being goaded - even by a friendly crowd - with wisecracks about his weight. And to herald his 'renaissance' after a hasty 42 not out against Zimbabwe is faintly ridiculous. </p> <p>Apart from the jibes, yesterday he had a quiet time, though he did take a straightforward catch to dismiss Lara off the reliable Ealham. Two overs later Graham Thorpe, who had looked exceptionally frisky throughout, produced an astounding catch at extra cover, diving to his left to grab a full-blooded drive from Gayle. </p> <p>Ricardo Powell may also have felt aggrieved after pulling Mullally towards square leg. Trescothick scampered to his right, dived and held on to the ball. Another confident contribution from the Somerset newcomer; not the most graceful mover but he has a good pair of hands. </p> <p>Since Craig White was just as mean, England's victory target was modest. Trescothick and Stewart soon made it look pathetic. Lacking the control and the psychological impact that Curtly Ambrose and Walsh seem to have over English batsmen, the West Indian pacemen offered plenty of scoring opportunities and soon enhanced the reputation of this Riverside pitch. Suddenly it looked like a belter. </p> <p>Trescothick took the lead. His confidence high after three fine games, he batted near his best. He cover-drove sweetly and without apparent effort or much foot movement, and soon he unveiled the pull shot. In a vibrant opening stand, he was the senior partner. Maybe Stewart, relieved to move past 12 - his score in the past three games - gave him his head. </p> <p>Trescothick has batted with such assurance in these matches that his chances of playing his first Test at Old Trafford are improving every day. One-day performances should not be significant when selecting a Test side, but it is hard not to be swayed by that extra touch of class. I wouldn't quibble with a Test cap for Trescothick, provided he is allowed to play his own way and the expectations are not unrealistic. His presence as an opener on 3 August would certainly encourage everyone to turn up on time.</p>",

He batted responsibly, recognising that his team had to win and that at Chester-le-Street 200 just might be competitive. His first boundary and the first of the innings did not arrive until the thirteenth over and that was a lofted on-drive off Caddick. Now Mullally, so much more confident with a white ball than a red one, intervened. First Sherwin Campbell was taken at point from the shoulder of his bat and then Jimmy Adams was bowled off the inside edge. Lara and Chris Gayle carefully attempted to restore the innings. They were aided by the introduction of Trescothick, whose two covers cost 13. Trescothick's batting is a more handsome sight than his bowling, but he has been pressed into action as Andrew Flintoff is unable to bowl at the moment. Flintoff has dominated the back pages this week to herald the onset of the silly season. So I'll be brief. No doubt he's too heavy; but it would have been better for him if the England management's concerns had not been leaked. It was unpleasant to hear him being goaded - even by a friendly crowd - with wisecracks about his weight. And to herald his 'renaissance' after a hasty 42 not out against Zimbabwe is faintly ridiculous. Apart from the jibes, yesterday he had a quiet time, though he did take a straightforward catch to dismiss Lara off the reliable Ealham. Two overs later Graham Thorpe, who had looked exceptionally frisky throughout, produced an astounding catch at extra cover, diving to his left to grab a full-blooded drive from Gayle. Ricardo Powell may also have felt aggrieved after pulling Mullally towards square leg. Trescothick scampered to his right, dived and held on to the ball. Another confident contribution from the Somerset newcomer; not the most graceful mover but he has a good pair of hands. Since Craig White was just as mean, England's victory target was modest. Trescothick and Stewart soon made it look pathetic. Lacking the control and the psychological impact that Curtly Ambrose and Walsh seem to have over English batsmen, the West Indian pacemen offered plenty of scoring opportunities and soon enhanced the reputation of this Riverside pitch. Suddenly it looked like a belter. Trescothick took the lead. His confidence high after three fine games, he batted near his best. He cover-drove sweetly and without apparent effort or much foot movement, and soon he unveiled the pull shot. In a vibrant opening stand, he was the senior partner. Maybe Stewart, relieved to move past 12 - his score in the past three games - gave him his head. Trescothick has batted with such assurance in these matches that his chances of playing his first Test at Old Trafford are improving every day. One-day performances should not be significant when selecting a Test side, but it is hard not to be swayed by that extra touch of class. I wouldn't quibble with a Test cap for Trescothick, provided he is allowed to play his own way and the expectations are not unrealistic. His presence as an opener on 3 August would certainly encourage everyone to turn up on time.",

However, apart from a robot animated Lenny Henry, they don't... well, they don't do an awful lot. They just stand there like a lot of, er, well, dummies, and there is a limit to how many times you can photograph your kids making signs behind Chris Evans or leering at Kylie Minogue. </p> <p>In the rooms beyond, you can catch a few film stars - Michael Caine and Anthony Hopkins - before you reach the main historical gallery, with its kings and queens of England, world leaders and Cabinet members. </p> <p>Again, there is nothing else to do but pose and photograph: here's me and the Pope, here's the kids and Queen Victoria, granny and John Major. It could go for an eternity. I became desperate to do something, anything, and positively pined for Legoland and Loggers Leap, or Alton Towers and Oblivion. </p> <p>On the other hand, Anna, 12, our elder daughter, her friend Charlotte and Olivia five, our younger daughter, were all moderately amused - although Olivia was frightened by the Chamber of Horrors, which we seemed unable to avoid or detour. </p> <p>By contrast, Anna and Charlotte - both Point Horror and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans - thought the chamber's torture scenes, burnings at stakes, beheadings, disembowellings and other horrors were 'cool and really scary', though the absence of an Ann Widdecombe tableaux fortunately stopped the chamber from being truly terrifying. </p> <p>The visit finished with a Disneyland-like ride - in a taxi-cab through a spirit of London experience, a bizarre amalgamation of scenes of the Great Fire, the Plague and the Swinging Sixties. </p> <p>Very surreal, but a painless, fairly fun way to end the tour, though our departure brought another disappointment: the discovery that most rock stars' figures have now been decamped to the Tussaud Group's new venue Rock Circus near Picadilly Circus. </p> <p>For Olivia, the lack of Spice Girls was a heart-rending affront, for the rest of us a source of relief. Nevertheless, the fact that some of the most famous modern waxwork figures were now housed separately was not made apparent until we were inside the building. </p> <p>In all, Madame Tussaud's is only moderate family fun, and really only suitable for older kids - who can at least recognise Nelson Mandela and the Queen. But the price is very steep while the queues at this time of year are utterly preposterous. Wait till November if you feel that you really have to go. </p> <p>As for getting there, that is the easy bit. Baker Street Tube station is just across the road, and there are plenty of NCP car parks in the area, though the latter impose a startling \u00a35.30 two-hour minimum charge, even on a Sunday. </p> <p>Finally, the food and drink tariff was typical captive family fare - \u00a35 for two medium Cokes and two small mineral waters - while the cafe was chaotic, particularly in one annexe where they have a shooting gallery!</p> <p><strong> Tour guide </strong> </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Go by Tube to Baker Street. If driving, there are a number of car parks in the area; NCP ones have a \u00a35.30 minimum charge for two hours. </p> <p><strong> Entry: </strong> Big queues, well managed but be prepared to wait three or four hours.</p> <p><strong> Tickets: </strong> \u00a311 for adults, \u00a37.50 children.</p> <p><strong> Ambience: </strong> Pretty hot and sweaty in summer.</p> <p><strong> Food and drink: </strong> Standard burger and chips fare. OK for what it is.</p> <p><strong> Navigation: </strong> Easily followed circuit. You can't avoid going into the Chamber of Horrors, which upset our five-year-old.</p> <p><strong> Kids' favourite: </strong> Waxworks of celebrities such as Hugh Grant and Pierce Brosnan.</p> <p><strong> Adult favourite:</strong> A Lenny Henry figure that tells jokes.</p> <p><strong> Biggest disappointment:</strong> Waxwork pop stars have all been moved to Rock Circus.</p> <p><strong> Parent's tip?</strong> Don't take young children; they won't recognise the people and won't like the Chamber of Horrors.</p> <p><strong> Kids' verdict?</strong> It's all right.</p> <p><strong> Parent's verdict? </strong> Disappointing.</p>",

You start in a courtyard in which the waxworks' most recent attractions are displayed: Hugh Grant (but no Liz Hurley), Pierce Brosnan, Mel Gibson, a motley crew of failed English sportsmen (a tautology, I admit), and a horrible, smirking Terry Venables (so don't go on a full stomach). Most figures are fairly well constructed and lifelike. However, apart from a robot animated Lenny Henry, they don't... well, they don't do an awful lot. They just stand there like a lot of, er, well, dummies, and there is a limit to how many times you can photograph your kids making signs behind Chris Evans or leering at Kylie Minogue. In the rooms beyond, you can catch a few film stars - Michael Caine and Anthony Hopkins - before you reach the main historical gallery, with its kings and queens of England, world leaders and Cabinet members. Again, there is nothing else to do but pose and photograph: here's me and the Pope, here's the kids and Queen Victoria, granny and John Major. It could go for an eternity. I became desperate to do something, anything, and positively pined for Legoland and Loggers Leap, or Alton Towers and Oblivion. On the other hand, Anna, 12, our elder daughter, her friend Charlotte and Olivia five, our younger daughter, were all moderately amused - although Olivia was frightened by the Chamber of Horrors, which we seemed unable to avoid or detour. By contrast, Anna and Charlotte - both Point Horror and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans - thought the chamber's torture scenes, burnings at stakes, beheadings, disembowellings and other horrors were 'cool and really scary', though the absence of an Ann Widdecombe tableaux fortunately stopped the chamber from being truly terrifying. The visit finished with a Disneyland-like ride - in a taxi-cab through a spirit of London experience, a bizarre amalgamation of scenes of the Great Fire, the Plague and the Swinging Sixties. Very surreal, but a painless, fairly fun way to end the tour, though our departure brought another disappointment: the discovery that most rock stars' figures have now been decamped to the Tussaud Group's new venue Rock Circus near Picadilly Circus. For Olivia, the lack of Spice Girls was a heart-rending affront, for the rest of us a source of relief. Nevertheless, the fact that some of the most famous modern waxwork figures were now housed separately was not made apparent until we were inside the building. In all, Madame Tussaud's is only moderate family fun, and really only suitable for older kids - who can at least recognise Nelson Mandela and the Queen. But the price is very steep while the queues at this time of year are utterly preposterous. Wait till November if you feel that you really have to go. As for getting there, that is the easy bit. Baker Street Tube station is just across the road, and there are plenty of NCP car parks in the area, though the latter impose a startling \u00a35.30 two-hour minimum charge, even on a Sunday. Finally, the food and drink tariff was typical captive family fare - \u00a35 for two medium Cokes and two small mineral waters - while the cafe was chaotic, particularly in one annexe where they have a shooting gallery! Tour guide Getting there: Go by Tube to Baker Street. If driving, there are a number of car parks in the area; NCP ones have a \u00a35.30 minimum charge for two hours. Entry: Big queues, well managed but be prepared to wait three or four hours. Tickets: \u00a311 for adults, \u00a37.50 children. Ambience: Pretty hot and sweaty in summer. Food and drink: Standard burger and chips fare. OK for what it is. Navigation: Easily followed circuit. You can't avoid going into the Chamber of Horrors, which upset our five-year-old. Kids' favourite: Waxworks of celebrities such as Hugh Grant and Pierce Brosnan. Adult favourite: A Lenny Henry figure that tells jokes. Biggest disappointment: Waxwork pop stars have all been moved to Rock Circus. Parent's tip? Don't take young children; they won't recognise the people and won't like the Chamber of Horrors. Kids' verdict? It's all right. Parent's verdict? Disappointing.",

      "body": "<p>'Mummy, are we coming or going?' Laura looked wearily up at me. It was 11.30am, two and a half hours since we had left our home in north-east London, and we still hadn't arrived at Legoland. To her five-year-old mind the day had already been so long that we must surely have been there, done it and be on our way home for tea. </p> <p>Going to Windsor by public transport had seemed the intelligent thing to do. 'There's so much to see,' friends had enthused. 'You really need a whole day.' But waiting for the M25 rush-hour to die down would mean setting off mid-morning: factor in jams, accidents or roadworks and we wouldn't be there till lunchtime. So we went on the train - trek to Waterloo, just miss train, wait 30 minutes for next train, train leaves 10 minutes late, find shuttle bus stop in Windsor, wait for bus... We got there at lunchtime. </p> <p>But it was all up from then on - or down, actually. Legoland occupies a beautiful hilltop site: from the turnstiles you can see for miles down the Thames Valley, with Windsor Castle in the middle distance and London stretching away to infinity. The park itself is laid out on the slopes immediately below this vantage point. </p> <p>So what should you do first? The opposite of what we did, probably. There are about 10 big rides, with queues to match - 45 minutes even on a term-time Monday. But there is a lot more to see and enjoy, much of it with no queues or very short ones. So instead of plunging into the queue for the first thing that catches your eye (our way), a better plan would be to wander around, find your bearings, marvel at the models, get lost in the mazes and wet at the 'water works' before making an informed decision on which rides are going to be worth nearly an hour. </p> <p>One wait even Laura saw as wasted time was for Balloon School - a full 45 minutes for a tame two-minute roundabout ride in mock hot-air balloons. The views were pleasant, but apart from that the ride would barely have passed muster at a children's seaside fairground. </p> <p>But we queued barely five minutes for Fairytale Brook, a five-minute 'boat' ride along a 'river' (real water) past models (Lego of course) of every storybook character you can imagine, culminating in an atmospheric 'cave' with Abanazer outside and Aladdin, treasure, lamp and genie (again all Lego) inside. It is probably aimed at pre-schoolers, but Pok\u00e9mon-loving, Darth Maul-admiring Aidan, eight, was entranced: 'That was wicked' - and he didn't mean the Hansel and Gretel witch. 'Aw, I don't want it to end.' We all enjoyed the quirkier touches: Big Bad Wolf listening to his Walkman; Handsome Prince talking on his mobile outside Sleeping Beauty's castle. </p> <p>Of a different order was Pirate Falls, 40 minutes this time and many warnings that you will GET WET. The boat ride past (Lego) pirates in various gruesome situations is a preliminary to a suspenseful haul to the top of the 'Falls' and an exhilarating plunge at what feels like breakneck speed into the 'lake'. We were all soaked - a well placed water cannon just before the end makes sure mums who think they'll stay drier by letting children go in front also GET WET. </p> <p>We decided not to spend any more time queuing - or rather I did. Along with many parents there I found those long waits hard to cope with. The fractious elements in the lines were invariably the grown-ups. Large man to small boy: 'Come on, this is awful. I don't want to stand here any more.' Son (soothingly): 'It'll be fun, Dad, I promise. Look, it's not much longer now...' </p> <p>When hunger made us unable to tackle anything else, a quick perusal of Legoland's eateries confirmed what I had been feeling all day: this is a very nice, middle-class theme park, full of nice middle-class parents and children wearing Mini Boden. And those parents do not want to feed Oscar and Allegra on junk, so there is a wide choice of menus. Burgers and nuggets are available, but they're not in your face. They weren't in the children's faces either: Laura and Aidan happily settled for slices of pizza at the Pasta Patch - and my spirali with smoked ham and broccoli was freshly cooked and perfectly fine too. My son, who prides himself on being able to tell a real pizza from a Pizza Hut version at 100 paces, pronounced his Margherita second only to those at the Italian family-run pizzeria near home. </p> <p>Letting lunch go down, we wandered around Miniland, the amazing Lego models of (mainly) London, with famous bits of the Continent thrown in. The model London includes underground station complete with moving Tube train, an opening Tower Bridge, buses, taxis, even roadworks. New this year is a model Millennium Dome, cut away to reveal the acrobatic show in full swing - a strange themed-entertainment- within-a-themed-entertainment experience. With New Labour in mind I looked carefully at the model of Leicester Square, but the gutters were empty of vomiting Lego teenagers.</p> <p><strong> Tour guide </strong></p> <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> Train from Waterloo takes 50 mins; shuttle bus 10-20 mins.

      "body": "<p>What is the Dome but a great white elephant? It was the end of a hot day there, with the whole family in tow. I couldn't help fancying - perhaps I had a little sunstroke - that with a tweak of its white flanks and with Tony Cragg's sculpture adapted to become a trunk, the Dome could even be rearranged to look like an elephant. </p> <p>But I have been keeping my thoughts to myself. Not one of my children would agree with me. They would be indignant. And they would not be alone. For the Dome - routinely written about as a flop - is attracting more than twice as many families as Alton Towers. And it is the children who most reliably seem to come out in favour of the experience. </p> <p>The curious truth seems to be that the younger you are, the more likely you are to be impressed. My (almost) four-year-old twins, Bernie and Os, are in love with the place. They do not like to hear it referred to as 'the Dome'. They prefer to speak of it, with approving formality, as the 'Millennium Dome'. Millennium is not an easy word to get your tongue around when you are small - but the Dome has earned their tongue-twisting best efforts. </p> <p>We arrived on one of the hottest days this summer - a party of six boys between the ages of 14 years and 18 months and assorted adults in an atmosphere of sweltering unreality. The building itself is suggestive of departure, somewhere between an airport and a spacecraft and there was, at the outset at least, a pleasant sense - enhanced by the weather - that we would presently fetch up on a more exotic planet. </p> <p>But first we headed towards the Body - it was impossible to ignore its mighty, reclining form. We had to queue but a juggler was hard at work to keep our tedium at bay and none of the children minded waiting at all. I inspected the multi-coloured, tiled skin in close-up and thought the Body large and jaded. But the children were delighted by its size and by occasional sightings of a brilliant yellow trapeze artist swinging with casual grace beyond it. 'Look, you go in by the bum!' they exclaimed as we trooped inside. </p> <p>Right from the beginning, the Dome staff could not have been nicer. I pushed Ted (18 months) up the body's escalators, through its bloody chambers and past its pendant, thunderous heart. Before each escalator, I was asked whether I was all right, and was the buggy safe on the escalators? The Body is not for those of a nervous disposition. Ted was not the only one who nearly jumped out of his skin when it started to make sounds as if overtaken by furious poltergeists. But the older boys were amused, especially by the room in which there were nine brains wobbling on sticks, one wearing a fez. I found the Body rather like a surreal department store, where nothing would induce you to shop. But once inside, we were carried along, as if part of its bloodstream. </p> <p>I preferred the section called 'Mind' and marvelled at Ron Mueck's boy in his larger-than-life reverie. I was sorry to learn (from another forthcoming member of staff) that Helen Chadwick's 'brain' has been removed because someone had stuck chewing gum on it and Chadwick's estate had con cluded that the security at the Dome was inadequate. </p> <p>'Talk', my stepson Tom (14) pointed out, 'seemed like an ad for BT'. It did not take long to discover just how right he was. (It is sponsored by BT). However, Tom and his brother Theo (12) relished the interactive 'Avatar' where you can be changed into a cartoon character. This is how Tom described his experience: </p> <p>'I went into a small booth twice the size of a BR toilet. An assistant made me tuck my shirt in and stand in a certain way with my feet apart and my arms at 45 degrees to my body. They took a photo of me three times in different positions. The assistant superimposed various dots over the picture of my face. I got two pieces of paper with details of how to access my avatar. I then went to a screen where a 'virtual me' pranced about on a flying bike around the dome with ET.' </p> <p>The Dome is full of stray actors, as if they had been released from a play and had subsequently got lost. People in Tudor costumes stroll about like lost souls, a robot lets off steam, a couple of jugglers perform, seemingly to please themselves. Of these actors, the ones we liked best were three frumpy women in macs and headscarves with elongated noses like monster parsnips. They walk around arm in arm and stick their noses into everything. 'They're really men,' said Leo. </p> <p> Bernie was in a state of high excitement in an area called the Time Keepers. I could not work out what this area had to do with time. It was a chaos of plastic balls, fired from balconies. It was like being inside one of Professor Brainstorm's inventions - and extremely noisy. The Dome is in love with noise. After trekking around for hours, it was a relief to stop off in 'Rest'. And while after a mere five minutes, I had had my fill of the music that is supposed to go on for a thousand years, I appreciated the cool of this pink catacomb and was diverted by the prostrate visitors reclining on their plaster beach like misdirected sunbathers. </p> <p>We saved the 'Millennium Show' for last (there are two shows a day and it is a good tip to see the afternoon show because you can then go to popular places in the morning without queueing and even achieve a quiet, uncrowded lunch at McDonald's or Aroma). </p> <p>By the time we sat down in the vast auditorium, we were wilting with weariness and even ice cream could not be guaranteed to keep temperament at bay. But it was bliss to be still and cool inside the theatre space and suddenly it occurred to me: the circus is what this building is for. It is a permanent Big Top - so big that the brave couple who unravel themselves at the top seem almost lost in the space; the eye could easily abandon them for ever. </p> <p>The show was the high spot (in every sense).

      "bodyText": "What is the Dome but a great white elephant? It was the end of a hot day there, with the whole family in tow. I couldn't help fancying - perhaps I had a little sunstroke - that with a tweak of its white flanks and with Tony Cragg's sculpture adapted to become a trunk, the Dome could even be rearranged to look like an elephant. But I have been keeping my thoughts to myself. Not one of my children would agree with me. They would be indignant. And they would not be alone. For the Dome - routinely written about as a flop - is attracting more than twice as many families as Alton Towers. And it is the children who most reliably seem to come out in favour of the experience. The curious truth seems to be that the younger you are, the more likely you are to be impressed. My (almost) four-year-old twins, Bernie and Os, are in love with the place. They do not like to hear it referred to as 'the Dome'. They prefer to speak of it, with approving formality, as the 'Millennium Dome'. Millennium is not an easy word to get your tongue around when you are small - but the Dome has earned their tongue-twisting best efforts. We arrived on one of the hottest days this summer - a party of six boys between the ages of 14 years and 18 months and assorted adults in an atmosphere of sweltering unreality. The building itself is suggestive of departure, somewhere between an airport and a spacecraft and there was, at the outset at least, a pleasant sense - enhanced by the weather - that we would presently fetch up on a more exotic planet. But first we headed towards the Body - it was impossible to ignore its mighty, reclining form. We had to queue but a juggler was hard at work to keep our tedium at bay and none of the children minded waiting at all. I inspected the multi-coloured, tiled skin in close-up and thought the Body large and jaded. But the children were delighted by its size and by occasional sightings of a brilliant yellow trapeze artist swinging with casual grace beyond it. 'Look, you go in by the bum!' they exclaimed as we trooped inside. Right from the beginning, the Dome staff could not have been nicer. I pushed Ted (18 months) up the body's escalators, through its bloody chambers and past its pendant, thunderous heart. Before each escalator, I was asked whether I was all right, and was the buggy safe on the escalators? The Body is not for those of a nervous disposition. Ted was not the only one who nearly jumped out of his skin when it started to make sounds as if overtaken by furious poltergeists. But the older boys were amused, especially by the room in which there were nine brains wobbling on sticks, one wearing a fez. I found the Body rather like a surreal department store, where nothing would induce you to shop. But once inside, we were carried along, as if part of its bloodstream. I preferred the section called 'Mind' and marvelled at Ron Mueck's boy in his larger-than-life reverie. I was sorry to learn (from another forthcoming member of staff) that Helen Chadwick's 'brain' has been removed because someone had stuck chewing gum on it and Chadwick's estate had con cluded that the security at the Dome was inadequate. 'Talk', my stepson Tom (14) pointed out, 'seemed like an ad for BT'. It did not take long to discover just how right he was. (It is sponsored by BT). However, Tom and his brother Theo (12) relished the interactive 'Avatar' where you can be changed into a cartoon character. This is how Tom described his experience: 'I went into a small booth twice the size of a BR toilet. An assistant made me tuck my shirt in and stand in a certain way with my feet apart and my arms at 45 degrees to my body. They took a photo of me three times in different positions. The assistant superimposed various dots over the picture of my face. I got two pieces of paper with details of how to access my avatar. I then went to a screen where a 'virtual me' pranced about on a flying bike around the dome with ET.' The Dome is full of stray actors, as if they had been released from a play and had subsequently got lost. People in Tudor costumes stroll about like lost souls, a robot lets off steam, a couple of jugglers perform, seemingly to please themselves. Of these actors, the ones we liked best were three frumpy women in macs and headscarves with elongated noses like monster parsnips. They walk around arm in arm and stick their noses into everything. 'They're really men,' said Leo. Bernie was in a state of high excitement in an area called the Time Keepers. I could not work out what this area had to do with time. It was a chaos of plastic balls, fired from balconies. It was like being inside one of Professor Brainstorm's inventions - and extremely noisy. The Dome is in love with noise. After trekking around for hours, it was a relief to stop off in 'Rest'. And while after a mere five minutes, I had had my fill of the music that is supposed to go on for a thousand years, I appreciated the cool of this pink catacomb and was diverted by the prostrate visitors reclining on their plaster beach like misdirected sunbathers. We saved the 'Millennium Show' for last (there are two shows a day and it is a good tip to see the afternoon show because you can then go to popular places in the morning without queueing and even achieve a quiet, uncrowded lunch at McDonald's or Aroma). By the time we sat down in the vast auditorium, we were wilting with weariness and even ice cream could not be guaranteed to keep temperament at bay. But it was bliss to be still and cool inside the theatre space and suddenly it occurred to me: the circus is what this building is for. It is a permanent Big Top - so big that the brave couple who unravel themselves at the top seem almost lost in the space; the eye could easily abandon them for ever. The show was the high spot (in every sense). And I was amazed and delighted by the relaxed atmosphere in which one can, if one chooses - and we did - park oneself in a caf\u00e9 to watch the show, or sit on the floor crosslegged, near the stage. My partner said, at the end of the day - which happened to be Father's Day - that it was the best he could remember. Tom said that while he couldn't put his finger on what he had enjoyed most, he was sorry to leave. But the Dome is clearly for the newest of the new generation: Ted was in heaven. He shouted and pointed at the miracle of the flying people. He swayed in time to the music and then suddenly, as if finally making up his mind about something, he took off across the floor, crawling with great speed and laughing - in the direction of the stage.

Adult \u00a320; senior citizen \u00a318; child (five-15 and student card holders) \u00a316.50; children under five free. ES40 card holders \u00a312.

Navigation: The signposting is OK once you get the hang of it. Kid's favourite feature: (varied: see right). Parents' favourite feature: Ron Mueck's 'Boy' was my favourite attraction - a magical sight. Most disappointing feature: The 'Journey Zone' was nothing like as exciting as it could have been. Our tip: Go to the afternoon performance of the Millennium show. Most people choose the morning one, leaving the other zones wonderfully empty. Kids' verdict: A great day out.

I begin,' they sort of take the skin off - yes, it is dead - and fill it with, er... stuff... Oh look! A pangolin!' </p> <p>Paleontology, zoology, mineralogy. You'll find all these and more on a visit to London's Natural History Museum, but, strangely, not taxidermy. But once this awkward moment has passed, you can relax. From the moment children arrive at the imposing and ornate entrance to this Victorian cathedral to the natural world, they are fascinated. </p> <p>The museum is an immediate winner on the 'wow factor'. At the main entrance to the Victorian Life galleries, they are greeted by the 26-metre frame of diplodocus in a massive central hall, its painted ceiling glittering with gold leaf. Go in via the Earth Galleries, and a huge escalator reaches up into the heavens and to take you through the Earth's core. </p> <p>It's the compelling world so familiar to children from natural history programmes on TV. Their appetites whetted, what better way to start than walking with dinosaurs, the museum's most ambitious and popular display. It's dark among the skeletons and the prehistoric groans and roars are alarmingly lifelike. 'Hold my hand, Dad,' says Sam, as we mount the stainless steel steps to the suspended modernist walkway. 'Yeah, it's pretty scary,' I mutter reassuringly. 'No Dad, I just think this thing is going to give way...' </p> <p>It's brilliantly done - museum curating as theatre - right down to the three deinonychus robots feeding greedily on a freshly killed tentosaurus. And for dino-maniac children like Sam, it's just like meeting their mates: 'I know who that is... Albertosaurus. I like Gallimimus, he's harmless.' </p> <p>So how do you follow that? Easy. Head on past the reptiles, take a look at the spectacularly ugly football fish ('Some people eat those. Pass me a bucket, quick.') until you reach the tranquil world of the marine invertebrate. A little obscure? Yes, but there's nothing quite like a giant lobster in a nineteenth-century mahogany display case to revive childhood memories of summer rock-pooling. </p> <p>Sam likes it too. The shells are brilliant and the names are straight out of Edward Lear: the Laminate Conch, the Astonishing Volute and the Giant Hairy Melongena. Just two galleries' worth and we're already satisfied.There's so much here, from the cross-section of the Giant Sequoia (the biggest tree in the world), to the tiny hummingbirds, and the museum is on such a vast scale that children will end their visit gratifyingly exhausted and keen to return. </p> <p>And you'll need to; by the time we reach the Earth Galleries, Sam is too tired to fully appreciate the earthquake simulator. There are plenty of buttons to push and levers to pull (notably in the creepy-crawlies gallery) with touch-screen computer guides for instant parental explanation. And if your children want a real hands-on experience, head to the basement and visit the swish new Investigate centre, where they can handle real specimens of animal skin, teeth, feathers and rocks - weigh them, measure them and use all sorts of microscopes. Great for budding David Attenboroughs. </p> <p>If you have younger children, it's also a breeze: Anna, our two-year-old, careered happily down the corridors yelling 'BEARS' at the top of her voice, behaviour which usually gets a few frowns elsewhere,but merely attracts approving glances here. The museum is also baby and buggy friendly, with big lifts and changing facilities. </p> <p>So far so good for hungry minds. What of hungry stomachs? There are four cafes and restaurants, with a variety of snacks and meals to suit all , but the Natural History really scores with its cavernous eating area, where you can eat packed lunches and drastically reduce the cost of a day out. </p> <p>The beauty of this museum is its central location: easily reached by public transport, it's within walking distance of two of London's great parks (Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park) for play and picnics, as well as the louche coffee bars and patisseries of London's French community, behind the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais, and the bazaars of Knightsbridge. Not to mention the two other museums next door (the Science and Victoria &amp; Albert). </p> <p>Too much for one day. So the smart move is to buy a \u00a349.50 family museums card, which gives you entry for a year to all three. I'll come clean. We have a card and are regular visitors, so this wasn't Sam or Anna's first trip. But it's an odd child who isn't moved by the beauty and power of the natural world - or the range of chocolates in the downstairs snack bar.</p> <p><strong> Tour guide </strong></p> <p><strong>Getting there: </strong> Use public transport. The museum is a short walk from South Kensington underground station (Circle, District and Piccadilly lines) or can be reached by bus routes 14, 49, 70, 345 and C1. Some London tour buses include the museum on their routes. </p> <p><strong> Entry:</strong> Queues are not too bad even at the busiest times, and fairly well managed. Opening hours: Mon-Sat 10am-5.50pm; Sun 11am-5.50pm.</p> <p><strong> Tickets:</strong> Adult \u00a37.50, child (under 16) free, senior citizens free, concs \u00a34.50. Season tickets: (also V&amp;A and Science Museum) Adult \u00a329, joint adult \u00a349.50, Concs \u00a316</p> <p><strong> Food and drink: </strong> Wide range of snacks meals and drinks at four restaurants and cafes (children's lunchbox \u00a33, soups \u00a32.50, pasta dishes \u00a34.50, burgers \u00a32-\u00a33, juices \u00a31.20).</p> <p><strong> Navigation: </strong> Free maps and good signposting with colour coded routes.Tours, activity sheets and headphone guides.</p> <p><strong> Best feature: </strong> Dinosaurs win hands down, but there are plenty of popular runners-up.</p> <p><strong> Most disappointing feature: </strong> Plant power. What's it for?</p> <p><strong> My tip: </strong> Check out the old-fashioned exhibits such as the one about Captain Scott's expedition to the South Pole (outside mineralogy). A glimpse of the museum's past glory.</p>",

The museum is also baby and buggy friendly, with big lifts and changing facilities. So far so good for hungry minds. What of hungry stomachs? There are four cafes and restaurants, with a variety of snacks and meals to suit all , but the Natural History really scores with its cavernous eating area, where you can eat packed lunches and drastically reduce the cost of a day out. The beauty of this museum is its central location: easily reached by public transport, it's within walking distance of two of London's great parks (Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park) for play and picnics, as well as the louche coffee bars and patisseries of London's French community, behind the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais, and the bazaars of Knightsbridge. Not to mention the two other museums next door (the Science and Victoria &amp; Albert). Too much for one day. So the smart move is to buy a \u00a349.50 family museums card, which gives you entry for a year to all three. I'll come clean. We have a card and are regular visitors, so this wasn't Sam or Anna's first trip. But it's an odd child who isn't moved by the beauty and power of the natural world - or the range of chocolates in the downstairs snack bar. Tour guide Getting there: Use public transport. The museum is a short walk from South Kensington underground station (Circle, District and Piccadilly lines) or can be reached by bus routes 14, 49, 70, 345 and C1. Some London tour buses include the museum on their routes. Entry: Queues are not too bad even at the busiest times, and fairly well managed. Opening hours: Mon-Sat 10am-5.50pm; Sun 11am-5.50pm. Tickets: Adult \u00a37.50, child (under 16) free, senior citizens free, concs \u00a34.50. Season tickets: (also V&amp;A and Science Museum) Adult \u00a329, joint adult \u00a349.50, Concs \u00a316 Food and drink: Wide range of snacks meals and drinks at four restaurants and cafes (children's lunchbox \u00a33, soups \u00a32.50, pasta dishes \u00a34.50, burgers \u00a32-\u00a33, juices \u00a31.20). Navigation: Free maps and good signposting with colour coded routes.Tours, activity sheets and headphone guides. Best feature: Dinosaurs win hands down, but there are plenty of popular runners-up. Most disappointing feature: Plant power. What's it for? My tip: Check out the old-fashioned exhibits such as the one about Captain Scott's expedition to the South Pole (outside mineralogy). A glimpse of the museum's past glory.",

Facilities are good and the seaside activities range from rockpool rambles with conservation experts to bouncy castles. Keen surfers will be kept occupied with the regular surfing competitions which take place well away from the swimming area. Swimming is safe and there are lifeguards. Dogs are allowed in a restricted area only and the beach is cleaned during and at the end of each day. </p> <p> <strong> No 3: Sutton-on-Sea, Lincolnshire</strong></p> <p>Mablethorpe Tourist Information Centre: 01507 472496 </p> <p>Awards: Blue Flag</p> <p>Having recently been on a 'beach-nourishment' programme, this beach offers a welcoming wide expanse of soft sand, pumped from the seabed as part of an initiative by the Environment Agency. Paddling pools and donkey rides, as well as its daily cleaning and brushing, make it safe and lots of fun. Sutton Sea Beach Mission organises children's activities during holidays such as beach games, races and sandcastle building. There are cafes and restaurants nearby, and toilets along the beach front. Dogs are banned and there is a full lifeguard service. </p> <p><strong>No 4: Benone Beach, Co Londonderry </strong><br>Limavady Tourist Information Centre: 028777 60307 </p> <p>Awards: Blue Flag - first beach in Northern Ireland to win one</p> <p>This seven-mile sandy beach is backed by heather-covered land and natural sand dunes. It boasts more than 90 different types of shell, but is remarkably free of shingle and seaweed. Bathing is safe and there is a full lifeguard service. Benone Tourist Complex, located on the beach, offers a huge range of activities, including indoor tennis courts, heated splash pool and putting green for when the weather turns nasty. The rich plant and animal life of the surrounding dunes offer excellent nature walks. </p> <p><strong>No 5: Dornoch, Sutherland</strong></p> <p>Highlands of Scotland Tourist Board: 01862 810400 </p> <p>Awards: Rural Beach Award from Tidy Britain</p> <p>The panoramic view across the Moray Firth, with the chance of catching a glimpse of the occasional whale or dolphin, draws visitors to this well-kept rural beach. The children's playground offers alternative activity if the weather is bad and the adjacent Site of Special Scientific Interest means that this beach is of enormous value to wildlife watchers. There is ample car parking as well as toilets and the beach is cleaned regularly.</p>",

No 2: Woolacombe Village Beach, Devon Woolacombe Tourist Information Centre: 01271 870553 Awards: Blue Flag, Best Family Resort in England for Excellence Awards Two and a quarter miles of golden sand backed by sandy hills and the Woolacombe Downs make this beach a stunning strand. Facilities are good and the seaside activities range from rockpool rambles with conservation experts to bouncy castles. Keen surfers will be kept occupied with the regular surfing competitions which take place well away from the swimming area. Swimming is safe and there are lifeguards. Dogs are allowed in a restricted area only and the beach is cleaned during and at the end of each day. No 3: Sutton-on-Sea, Lincolnshire Mablethorpe Tourist Information Centre: 01507 472496 Awards: Blue Flag Having recently been on a 'beach-nourishment' programme, this beach offers a welcoming wide expanse of soft sand, pumped from the seabed as part of an initiative by the Environment Agency. Paddling pools and donkey rides, as well as its daily cleaning and brushing, make it safe and lots of fun. Sutton Sea Beach Mission organises children's activities during holidays such as beach games, races and sandcastle building. There are cafes and restaurants nearby, and toilets along the beach front. Dogs are banned and there is a full lifeguard service. No 4: Benone Beach, Co Londonderry Limavady Tourist Information Centre: 028777 60307 Awards: Blue Flag - first beach in Northern Ireland to win one This seven-mile sandy beach is backed by heather-covered land and natural sand dunes. It boasts more than 90 different types of shell, but is remarkably free of shingle and seaweed. Bathing is safe and there is a full lifeguard service. Benone Tourist Complex, located on the beach, offers a huge range of activities, including indoor tennis courts, heated splash pool and putting green for when the weather turns nasty. The rich plant and animal life of the surrounding dunes offer excellent nature walks. No 5: Dornoch, Sutherland Highlands of Scotland Tourist Board: 01862 810400 Awards: Rural Beach Award from Tidy Britain The panoramic view across the Moray Firth, with the chance of catching a glimpse of the occasional whale or dolphin, draws visitors to this well-kept rural beach. The children's playground offers alternative activity if the weather is bad and the adjacent Site of Special Scientific Interest means that this beach is of enormous value to wildlife watchers. There is ample car parking as well as toilets and the beach is cleaned regularly.",

      "body": "<p>I was looking for somewhere to take my parents after an American Independence Day party we would all be attending, somewhere that would compliment the first half of the evening. There were burger bars, of course, and rib shacks and joints doing crabcakes and Caesar salads as if they were dishes that really mattered. But that seemed a bit predictable. And then I stumbled upon it. Where better to go after a party celebrating American Independence than Iran, The Restaurant? I reckoned if we dumped the US flag lapel badges and brushed the red, white and blue glitter from our hair, we might just get away with it. </p> <p>Iran, The Restaurant (as against 'Iran, The Musical' and 'Iran, The Diplomatic Incident') is on that extraordinary stretch of London's Edgware Road which, on a muggy summer's night, could be the main drag in any Levantine city east of Nicosia. Diners spill out on to the pavement to blow smoke from shared hookah pipes into the twilight air, and restaurants representing half a dozen Middle Eastern countries which have often been at war with one another here sit happily cheek by sagging jowl. </p> <p>At Iran, a smallish place which, like many of the women promenading the street outside, was decked out in beige and gold, we were offered a large table by the window. 'Big table means I can bring more food means we can make more money,' said the amiable waiter, which seemed like quite a good gag - until the bill arrived. Because, while most of the menu is hardly what you would call extortionate, a big meal can easily mount up. Then again, its size may simply have been down to the enthusiasm of my mother - of which more later.</p> <p>One benefit of our table was a clear view of the bread oven, a tilted clay cylinder against the inside of which wafer-thin leaves of dough would be slapped, to cook in about 45 seconds flat. It was a great piece of kitchen theatre. To make the most of this marvellous bread, we ordered five starters, each at \u00a33.95, from a list of about 20. Here, stuffed vine leaves proved that the crude Greek version does the dish a great injustice: they were soft and delicate, the success of each parcel as much down to the young, fragile green leaves on the outside as the pungent filling within.</p> <p>A dish of roasted, crushed aubergine was gorgeous: both smoky and unctuous. Salted pickles - sharp and crisp with a seriously brackish end - were perhaps an acquired taste, but I managed to acquire it. A dish of yogurt and cucumber, spared the violent garlic kick of tzatziki, was fine. The only down-note was a creamy mix of chicken and peas, which was the kind of thing you'd find offered on a sandwich bar as a filling.</p> <p>For the main course the only way to go is with grilled meats, which is what Iran does best. Most of the dishes are priced between \u00a39 and \u00a312, apart from one, the mixed grill, which comes in at a sniff under \u00a320. Which, of course, was what my mother ordered. </p> <p>I pointed out that she'd just chosen the most expensive thing on the menu. Oh, she said. She explained that she saw it as one of the pleasures of seniority never to look at the prices of dishes on menus. And anyway, as she doesn't drink, there was always a little slack on the bill. I gave thanks that, indeed, she doesn't drink, because she could have done serious damage with the bizarre wine list. It possesses the kind of acceleration normally found only at Brands Hatch. The reds, for example, start with a Beaujolais for \u00a313.95 and end, just eight bottles later, with a Chateau Margaux at \u00a3444.50. Ouch.</p> <p>As to those grilled meats, they were terrific: slabs of carefully spiced, minced-lamb kofta, caramelised outside, soft within; chunks of seared chicken on skewers, the meat still moist; lamb on the bone and off, as chop and as fillet. They needed no more to accompany them than a squirt of lemon juice and a couple of bowls of dry, fluffy rice flavoured with nuts and saffron, sweet red lentils and fried onions. </p> <p>The puddings are of the sweet, sticky kind to be found all over the Middle East. The waiter, clearly eyeing up space on the table, offered to bring us a selection, which my mother thought was a spiffing idea. There was no price on the menu for selections. I headed her off at the pass and chose just a couple of pastries which were, well, sticky and toothsome, as these things always are. However, the star was my father's water ice flavoured with a light syrup, rose water and threaded through with a kind of vermicelli noodle. Spiked up with a squeeze from the cut lemon it was a perfect end to the meal.</p> <p>Iran, The Restaurant does what it does exceptionally well; if grilled meat is your thing, there are probably few places better to go. But it does also do it at a price. With just mineral water, a couple of glasses of fruit juice and a 15 per cent service charge slapped on top, the bill for three came to \u00a3116. Oh, and they don't take plastic. </p> <p>I had to touch the old man for dinner; happily, he's one of those old-fashioned chaps who doesn't like to move on the street without a couple of ponies in his back pocket.

      "body": "<p>Something for the weekend, sir? How about a 207-page Competition Commission report on the three proposed mergers of Carlton Communications, Granada Group, and United News and Media? </p> <p>There's a racy document to get the adrenaline pumping. In fact Friday's announcement from Stephen Byers that he would clear a proposed merger of Carlton and United News throws up almost more questions than it answers by allowing any number of corporate permutations. But human nature could be the deciding factor in this fascinating computation of TV assets. </p> <p>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry did what had been widely expected - allowing controlled relaxation of ITV ownership - but the scenario he has set up is anything but straightforward. </p> <p>It hangs now on the intentions, egos and banking advice of three men: Carlton Communications chairman Michael Green, United News and Media's chief executive Lord Clive Hollick and Granada Media chairman Charles Allen. All three men will be at their desks this weekend deciding whether to engage in a peace process or push the red button on the 'nuclear' option. </p> <p>In order to keep within the statutory rules for TV ownership, and in agreement with the Competition Commission's report, Byers' only surprise was to insist that if Carlton and United News and Media did merge, they would have to dispose of the Merid ian franchise, currently held by United News. By insisting on this disposal rather than allowing Carlton and United to choose from a portfolio that includes in Carlton's case the London weekday licence, Central TV, and Westcountry TV, and in United's case Anglia and HTV as well as Meridian, there has been a subtle but important shift in the dynamics of the deal. In the \u00a38 billion agreed merger, which both United and Carlton resorted to as a defensive measure, the City was quick to interpret Lord Hollick as having the upper hand. </p> <p>As chief executive of the merged entity, and enjoying at the time a more sympathetic relationship with the City, his role as chief executive with Green as chairman puts him in pole position. Few would have put money on Green surviving in the merged company for more than 12 months. </p> <p>If United is now selling its key ITV asset - an eventuality it was certainly planning for - the question in every player's mind this weekend is whether Carlton will decide to step out of the merger and, if it does, what Granada will do. </p> <p>This weekend Hollick and Green will have to thrash out new terms for the merger they originally proposed, which would inevitably give Carlton shareholders a better price. Whether that is enough to deter Green from taking a chance to remain an independent player in ITV remains to be seen. </p> <p>'You could say it's an outcome we were broadly expecting, but the devil is certainly in the detail,' said one adviser to the companies involved. 'This effectively means the Carlton/United merger has to be dead in the water,' said another. </p> <p>This is not only a question of ego, but also of the price of the original deal. City analysts point to the fact that Carlton has cleaned up its business and become more focused since January, which has in part contributed to a share price rise. Selling Meridian for around \u00a3800m would, say some, both land the new company with a tax bill and dilute earnings per share. </p> <p>The consensus is, however, that Granada Media, recently vilified in some quarters for having 'lost its way', has come up smelling of roses. </p> <p>'Granada is holding all the cards. It can do anything, but it doesn't have to,' says one analyst. 'They won't move a muscle until they know what Carlton and United are going to do. What the Byers ruling means is that they can at worst take up the Meridian licence without any serious competition.' </p> <p>The only other sizable ITV company that might look at the South-east franchise would be Scottish Media Group, which owns STV, and as Granada already has an 18 per cent stake in Scottish, the northern company may not want to risk a run-in that could result in it losing its own independence. </p> <p>The 'ITV peace process' would be the most straightforward option: Carlton and United agreeing to continue with their merger and offering Granada the Meridian licence, which would leave two reasonably well-balanced companies running the network until new primary legislation allowed ITV to move to become one company. This could take a further 18 months to hit the statute book. </p> <p>Despite Charles Allen's statement earlier last week that the best option would be for two companies of equal size to emerge from the carve- up, observers point out that Granada Media has raised a \u00a32bn war chest from its recent demerger and flotation. While Meridian would account for less than half of this, it may wish to pursue a more ambi tious hostile takeover. </p> <p>'Where we go from here ought to rest just on a sensible approach to asset valuation,' says one ITV executive. 'But the wild card will be the egos and aspirations of the three main players.' </p> <p>And this weekend at least, the pressure will be on Green, to decide whether he is happy with his merger plans, and on Allen, to decide how much of the party he wants to poop. </p> <p><strong> Make your mind up time: the choices they face</strong></p> <p><strong> Michael Green</strong> Carlton Communications<br> Green has the most thinking to do this weekend. His options are: <br> \u0095 Press ahead with a Carlton/United merger: he would be chairman to Hollick's chief executive. But United would have to sell Meridian, and the shares would rise on an announcment, so at least the terms of such a merger would have to change. <br> \u0095 Or he could, as one analyst put it 'double-cross United': join in a break-up of United, which would give Green two ITV licences plus Express Newspapers, while Granada kept Meridian. </p> <p><strong>Clive Hollick</strong> United News and Media<br> Hollick has no options: he must press ahead with the Carlton-United merger. He will want to broker a peaceful deal with Granada by selling it the Meridian franchise. He will need to offer Carlton a better deal, but if faced with a hostile bid from Granada, he will remain calm - his motivation has always been to deliver value to shareholders, not to carve a career as a media mogul. </p> <p>Hollick won't want to sweeten the Carlton deal too much, but if the merger comes apart, United is likely to be picked off.</p> <p><strong>Charles Allen</strong> Granada Media<br> A more restful weekend lies ahead for Allen. He has two options: go for a peaceful settlement and settle for Meridian, or play the wrecking ball. </p> <p>If Green wobbles, the two could divide United; likewise, Allen could take out Carlton, but might be put off by off-loading one of the key London licences, Carlton or LWT. He may prefer to face an independent Carlton in the final consolidation rather than a merged company under Hollick. But the inevitability of Granada owning ITV seems a step closer.</p>",

In the \u00a38 billion agreed merger, which both United and Carlton resorted to as a defensive measure, the City was quick to interpret Lord Hollick as having the upper hand. As chief executive of the merged entity, and enjoying at the time a more sympathetic relationship with the City, his role as chief executive with Green as chairman puts him in pole position. Few would have put money on Green surviving in the merged company for more than 12 months. If United is now selling its key ITV asset - an eventuality it was certainly planning for - the question in every player's mind this weekend is whether Carlton will decide to step out of the merger and, if it does, what Granada will do. This weekend Hollick and Green will have to thrash out new terms for the merger they originally proposed, which would inevitably give Carlton shareholders a better price. Whether that is enough to deter Green from taking a chance to remain an independent player in ITV remains to be seen. 'You could say it's an outcome we were broadly expecting, but the devil is certainly in the detail,' said one adviser to the companies involved. 'This effectively means the Carlton/United merger has to be dead in the water,' said another. This is not only a question of ego, but also of the price of the original deal. City analysts point to the fact that Carlton has cleaned up its business and become more focused since January, which has in part contributed to a share price rise. Selling Meridian for around \u00a3800m would, say some, both land the new company with a tax bill and dilute earnings per share. The consensus is, however, that Granada Media, recently vilified in some quarters for having 'lost its way', has come up smelling of roses. 'Granada is holding all the cards. It can do anything, but it doesn't have to,' says one analyst. 'They won't move a muscle until they know what Carlton and United are going to do. What the Byers ruling means is that they can at worst take up the Meridian licence without any serious competition.' The only other sizable ITV company that might look at the South-east franchise would be Scottish Media Group, which owns STV, and as Granada already has an 18 per cent stake in Scottish, the northern company may not want to risk a run-in that could result in it losing its own independence. The 'ITV peace process' would be the most straightforward option: Carlton and United agreeing to continue with their merger and offering Granada the Meridian licence, which would leave two reasonably well-balanced companies running the network until new primary legislation allowed ITV to move to become one company. This could take a further 18 months to hit the statute book. Despite Charles Allen's statement earlier last week that the best option would be for two companies of equal size to emerge from the carve- up, observers point out that Granada Media has raised a \u00a32bn war chest from its recent demerger and flotation. While Meridian would account for less than half of this, it may wish to pursue a more ambi tious hostile takeover. 'Where we go from here ought to rest just on a sensible approach to asset valuation,' says one ITV executive. 'But the wild card will be the egos and aspirations of the three main players.' And this weekend at least, the pressure will be on Green, to decide whether he is happy with his merger plans, and on Allen, to decide how much of the party he wants to poop. Make your mind up time: the choices they face Michael Green Carlton Communications Green has the most thinking to do this weekend. His options are: \u0095 Press ahead with a Carlton/United merger: he would be chairman to Hollick's chief executive. But United would have to sell Meridian, and the shares would rise on an announcment, so at least the terms of such a merger would have to change. \u0095 Or he could, as one analyst put it 'double-cross United': join in a break-up of United, which would give Green two ITV licences plus Express Newspapers, while Granada kept Meridian. Clive Hollick United News and Media Hollick has no options: he must press ahead with the Carlton-United merger. He will want to broker a peaceful deal with Granada by selling it the Meridian franchise. He will need to offer Carlton a better deal, but if faced with a hostile bid from Granada, he will remain calm - his motivation has always been to deliver value to shareholders, not to carve a career as a media mogul. Hollick won't want to sweeten the Carlton deal too much, but if the merger comes apart, United is likely to be picked off. Charles Allen Granada Media A more restful weekend lies ahead for Allen. He has two options: go for a peaceful settlement and settle for Meridian, or play the wrecking ball. If Green wobbles, the two could divide United; likewise, Allen could take out Carlton, but might be put off by off-loading one of the key London licences, Carlton or LWT. He may prefer to face an independent Carlton in the final consolidation rather than a merged company under Hollick. But the inevitability of Granada owning ITV seems a step closer.",

'We have to make domestic violence as socially unacceptable as smoking and drink-driving.' </p> <p>The findings horrified groups working for women. Julie Bindel, of pressure group Women for Justice, said much more needed to be done to help women report abuse. One of the biggest problems, she said, was refuges for battered women. 'These are the last places anyone would want to go. People would not need to ask why women go back to violent men if they looked at some of these so-called refuges.' </p> <p>Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman Jackie Ballard said that the figures only revealed the tip of the iceberg: 'For the majority of women who come forward to report domestic violence, it is not the first time, but more like the fortieth.' </p> <p>In Avon and Somerset, the number of incidents has risen from 4,791 in 1998-89 to nearly 9,973 in the year to March 2000. </p> <p>In the West Midlands, where the crime rate remained relatively stable for four years, domestic incidents have risen from 14,011 in 1996-97 to a staggering 25,225 over the last year. </p> <p>In Northumbria and the Metropolitan Police area, domestic violence accounts for nearly 80,000 incidents. Meanwhile, Victim Support has recorded a 40 per cent rise in cases of domestic violence, from 25,000 to 35,000. </p> <p>Home Secretary Jack Straw will this week unveil crime figures which reveal a steep rise in violence for the second year. </p> <p>Women's groups and criminologists have joined the police in calling for a national strategy to identify and convict people of what police now call 'family crimes'. </p> <p>The Government believes that changes in society - with people divorcing more frequently - have contributed to the rise. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe will use the rise in the figures to say the Government is soft on crime: 'When the crime rate falls, Jack Straw is happy to take credit for it; he doesn't say it's because fewer crimes are being reported.' </p> <p>Professor Elizabeth Stanko of Royal Holloway College, London, who carried out the research, said: 'The focus of the politicians is wrong. It has taken years of work to get women to come forward and if they do you expect crime levels to rise.' </p> <p>The Met will this month publish minimum standards for domestic, racial and homophobic crime. They have also extended their definition of domestic violence to include threatening behaviour, violence or 'psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional' abuse between adults who are or were partners or family. </p>",

'The scale of this problem is mind-blowing,' said John Godsave, of the Racial and Violent Crimes Task Force. 'We have to make domestic violence as socially unacceptable as smoking and drink-driving.' The findings horrified groups working for women. Julie Bindel, of pressure group Women for Justice, said much more needed to be done to help women report abuse. One of the biggest problems, she said, was refuges for battered women. 'These are the last places anyone would want to go. People would not need to ask why women go back to violent men if they looked at some of these so-called refuges.' Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman Jackie Ballard said that the figures only revealed the tip of the iceberg: 'For the majority of women who come forward to report domestic violence, it is not the first time, but more like the fortieth.' In Avon and Somerset, the number of incidents has risen from 4,791 in 1998-89 to nearly 9,973 in the year to March 2000. In the West Midlands, where the crime rate remained relatively stable for four years, domestic incidents have risen from 14,011 in 1996-97 to a staggering 25,225 over the last year. In Northumbria and the Metropolitan Police area, domestic violence accounts for nearly 80,000 incidents. Meanwhile, Victim Support has recorded a 40 per cent rise in cases of domestic violence, from 25,000 to 35,000. Home Secretary Jack Straw will this week unveil crime figures which reveal a steep rise in violence for the second year. Women's groups and criminologists have joined the police in calling for a national strategy to identify and convict people of what police now call 'family crimes'. The Government believes that changes in society - with people divorcing more frequently - have contributed to the rise. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe will use the rise in the figures to say the Government is soft on crime: 'When the crime rate falls, Jack Straw is happy to take credit for it; he doesn't say it's because fewer crimes are being reported.' Professor Elizabeth Stanko of Royal Holloway College, London, who carried out the research, said: 'The focus of the politicians is wrong. It has taken years of work to get women to come forward and if they do you expect crime levels to rise.' The Met will this month publish minimum standards for domestic, racial and homophobic crime. They have also extended their definition of domestic violence to include threatening behaviour, violence or 'psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional' abuse between adults who are or were partners or family.",

      "body": "<p>Codenamed Operation Lion, a classified document planning the Queen Mother's obsequies has been kicking around Whitehall for decades, constantly in need of revision as the fortunes of the monarchy faltered. The original in my possession, dating from the mid-Nineties, envisaged four days lying-in-state at the Palace of Westminster, followed by the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. Television would 'go to black' as national life ground to a halt for a week or more - no EastEnders , no Coronation Street - in a nervous attempt to re-cement the monarchy's position at the heart of British life with a full-scale re-enactment of VE Day.</p> <p>In the early Nineties, soon after the Queen's 'annus horribilis' but long before Diana's death, I took part in a top-secret, all-day BBC rehearsal for the Solemn But Inevitable Day referred to only in the most hushed of tones. All normal programming was assumed 'cancelled' as Television Centre at White City was given over for an entire Sunday to 'live' updates from a sombre-voiced Jennie Bond outside Clarence House, amid copious footage of the Blitz as black-tied studio pundits debated with Peter Sissons the significance of the deceased to the British twentieth century.</p> <p>It was hard, frankly, to come up with much. I listened with disbelief as a woman who had never done a day's work in her life, who had blithely run up eight-figure overdrafts of the taxpayers' money on racehorses, had four palatial residences, 50 full-time servants and the pampered life of a latter-day Marie-Antoinette, was credited with winning the Second World War singlehanded.</p> <p>'Now we can look the East End in the face,' the Queen Mother's much-quoted remark on surveying the rubble of a bombed wing of Buckingham Palace, served as a mantra of her pearly-queen hold over millions. I was not encouraged to quote the wry remark recently made to me by one disaffected courtier: 'She wouldn't even know where the East End was.'</p> <p>So I was heartened but unsurprised last week when Channel 4 chose to risk some home truths about the Queen Mother on the eve of her hundredth birthday. Even back then, before John Major's diehard monarchists gave way to Tony Blair's closet republicans, before Diana's abrupt demise poleaxed the people and put the wind up the Windsors, senior BBC executives realised that its plans for black-framed screens, half-mast flags and solemn music reeked absurdly of a Reithian Britain that no longer exists, of an unassailably secure monarchy uncritically beloved of its subjects.</p> <p>ITV (let alone Channel 4) would be taking a much more realistic approach - snappy documentary footage and respectful but objective assessments amid top-rated shows proceeding as usual - and so stealing the audience. The BBC's plans, like Operation Lion, were hastily sent back to the drawing-board.</p> <p>Then came Diana's death, precipitating some of the most dramatic scenes ever relayed by British television, and the general assumption that in death the people's princess had finally managed to upstage the grand old lady - her own grandmother's best friend - with whom she shared a strong mutual antipathy. 'The chief leper in the leper colony,' was how the princess once described to me over a gossipy lunch the woman Cecil Beaton had once called 'everyone's favourite granny'.</p> <p>But Diana's memory soon faded, thanks to sly co-operation between a newly slick Buckingham Palace public-relations machine and a disappointingly craven Downing Street, too timid to take on the monarchy as New Labour concentrated from day one on re-election.</p> <p>The Westminster Abbey heroics of Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, were cancelled out by his own seamy divorce, then his shameless commercial exploitation of her memory, before Britain gingerly began to re-examine itself, wondering quite what all the fuss had been about. As the Queen Mum soldiered gamely on, British life soon returned to normal, with her 1998 hip operation leading the BBC news as the Government contemplated war with Iraq.</p> <p>For the Windsors, too, it was soon back to business as usual - Charles now free to consort openly with his Camilla; William foxhunting in chip-off-the-old-block defiance of government policy and public opinion; the ageing Queen scowling at New Labour's jazzed-up version of her national anthem.</p> <p>This last was the central image of Blair's thrusting, 'modern' Britain, apart, of course, from a non-functioning ferris wheel and a Thames that failed to catch fire, broadcast to the world on millennium night from his tragi-comic, billion-pound Dome.</p> <p>When their private yacht was decommissioned - a floating embassy for Britain, if you believed Tory election propaganda - the Windsors pub licly shed the tears they had failed to find for the princess (supposedly because they were not given to public shows of emotion). Spared Diana's populist antics, the ex-officio FirstFamily could return to being their true selves, scarcely bothering to conceal their contempt for the focus groups and phony photo-opportunities - partying with pop stars, dropping in on pubs and council houses - laid on by the Government's eager-beaver spin-doctors.</p> <p>Which is why, amid the month and more of pomp and pageantry marking their matriarch's centenary, the Windsors should not take undue heart from the touching outpourings of affection due any human being on his or her hundredth birthday, let alone the glutinous 'God Bless You, Ma'am' forelock-tugging of the tabloids and the Daily Telegraph. Until very recently, it would have been unthinkable for the BBC to pass on live coverage of Wednesday's pageant in her honour, choosing to hand it to ITV rather than risk delaying Neighbours.</p> <p>Nor are courtiers too thrilled with Tony Blair for turning down the touching notion that her hundredth birthday should be declared a national holiday. These are signs of the times which are furrowing Palace brows as Operation Lion is scaled down yet again.</p> <p>Come that day, the Queen Mother's demise will turn out to be an even more pivotal moment than Diana's for the antique, irrational, ever more incongruous institution of hereditary monarchy. The widow of the wartime King George VI symbolised a moment in British history when this feudal tomfoolery was at its most deceptively potent. Without her, the bedraggled rump she leaves behind will be revealed for what it is - a spoilt, selfish bunch of interlopers, who have long since outstayed their welcome, holding Britain back from its potentially dynamic European future by encouraging it to cling, heedlessly and extravagantly, to decayed dreams of its imperial past, personified these days primarily by arrogant, xenophobic, football hooligans abroad.</p> <p>The irony, of course, is that the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, beloved by millions for reasons they themselves cannot quite articulate or understand, has always been the most spoilt and selfish of the lot. The daughter of a hereditary earl, just like Diana, she took a somewhat different approach to her marital good fortune, milking it for all the creature comforts with few of the responsibilities, fixing her eye on the throne as soon as her husband's older brother looked like putting love before duty, and crowding her unfortunate young daughters' freedom of movement after her husband's premature death.</p> <p>The young Miss Bowes-Lyon may have twice turned down proposals of marriage from the sweet, stammering, but unprepossessing Duke of York, but her eventual acceptance of his royal hand soon revealed quite as much flint as warmth in that celebrated heart of gold.</p> <p>Luckily for her, Lady Elizabeth married one of the few Windsor men never to look at another woman, so she was spared the heartache endured with averted eyes by most of the 'married' (as opposed to 'born') royals of generations both before and after her. She was unarguably the making of the reluctant King George VI, visibly (and self-confessedly) terrified as he was pitchforked on to the throne by his brother's abdication.</p> <p>With clinical determination, she organised the curing of his stammer and stage-managed his stand beside Churchill as a symbol of Britain's fortitude during the nightmare of protracted war.</p> <p>Amid the national crisis, it was swiftly forgotten that the pre-war king and queen had been devout appeasers, responsible for the most unconstitutional act of the century when they endorsed Neville Chamberlain and his Munich Agreement by escorting him on to the balcony of Buckingham Palace. And that the belligerent Churchill was the last man they wanted to see succeed him.</p> <p>Their swift change of political horses remains, of course, the reason why the generation which fought so manfully in that war always nursed the kind of devotion for the Queen Mum normally reserved by British manhood for its nannies or school matrons. This is why they chose to overlook her conspicuous human failings: her stubbornly cruel treatment of Wallis Simpson, 'the woman who killed my husband'; her wilful burial of her head in the sand during the domestic dramas of her own dysfunctional family; her key role in the casting of the Charles-Diana soap opera which brought the institution of monarchy to its knees.</p> <p>On 4 August 1900, this future queen-empress entered an already sepia world as another, Victoria, lay dying. Ladysmith had been relieved in February, and Mafeking in May. That year also saw the Labour Party founded, W.G. Grace retire from cricket, Puccini write Tosca, Joseph Conrad publish Lord Jim and Freud his Interpretation of Dreams. After a bumpy patch in the 1870s, when British republicanism reached a zenith it has never since approached, the monarchy had been craftily reinvented by Disraeli.</p> <p>Victoria's favourite Prime Minister turned around her rampant unpopularity, for living off the Civil List despite withdrawing from public life after her husband's early death, by casting her as the empress of a quarter of the world's population. Britain's imperial pride was suddenly embodied in this frail, old woman with the trumped-up title.</p> <p>Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon's father had handy connections at court. She was the ninth child of Claud, Lord Glamis, heir to the Earl of Strathmore and Lord-Lieutenant of Angus, a typical, old-school patrician of the period, said to hide a kind heart behind his gruff exterior and walrus moustache.</p> <p>As influential in the shaping of their youngest daughter's character was her mother, the former Celia Cavendish-Bentinck, kinswoman to the Duke of Portland. With the outbreak of the First World War, on Elizabeth's fourteenth birthday, Celia converted the family's ancestral Scottish pile, Glamis Castle, into a convalescent hospital.</p> <p>To the young Elizabeth, who combined her education in the social graces with cheering up the patients, the war meant 'knitting, knitting, knitting'.</p> <p>Thanks to her mother's example, she developed a brand of noblesse oblige which has stood her in good stead ever since, somehow persuading her social inferiors that, as toffs go, she was 'all right'.</p> <p>The pretty young aristocrat was able to enjoy five postwar years of the London debutante's life, including several racy love affairs, before marrying the shy, gauche Duke of York, second son of King George V, in April 1923. Their wedding in Westminster Abbey was the first there of a monarch's son since that of the future Richard II to Princess Anne of Bohemia more than 500 years before, thus establishing another twentieth-century myth, serially exploited by the Windsors, that royal nuptials must always be marked by glorious public ceremonies worthy of national holidays.</p> <p>At the time, a daring proposal from the BBC that the service be broadcast was vetoed by the dean and chapter of Westminster on the grounds that 'people might hear it while sitting in public houses, with their hats on'.</p> <p>Times change, and with them, when it can no longer avoid it, the monarchy. The sequence of events leading to Edward VIII's abdication in 1936 sparked a crisis which might have proved terminal, were it not for rather more important distractions in Europe.</p> <p>The rise of Adolf Hitler, to whom the exiled Duke of Windsor was soon making advances, proved the unlikely salvation of the family business he had so damaged. The cosy institution of the 'family monarchy' - initiated by Victoria, endangered by her adulterous son, Edward VII, but carefully rebuilt by the gruff George V and his curiously endearing stamp collection - now reached its zenith with portraits of the new queen pouring tea for her husband and daughters, for all the world as if they were just another English family, keeping the national upper lip stiff in the face of a common enemy.</p> <p>That war may have seen the rebirth of the monarchy as an institution around which an embattled nation could rally, but it also sealed the demise of the Empire which had underpinned it. For 50 more years, bowler-hatted stiffs and horny-handed sons of toil were strangely united in seeing the monarchy as a symbol of a bygone Britain of which they were reluctant to let go, a Britannia which, however unwilling they were to admit it, no longer ruled the waves.</p> <p>It was a Britain implicitly symbolised by the traditional, beyond-reproach figure of the seemingly eternal Queen Mother. Even when the younger royals began to discredit their elders, she somehow survived as a symbol of moral probity, above the fray, seemingly let down, no doubt mortally embarrassed by it all. Yet much of the blame can be laid at her firmly closed door.</p> <p>Few British republicans wish to see the monarchy fall because of the human failings of its transient, hereditary occupants. They have loftier ideals, centred around true notions of popular democracy and the civic rights of a people demeaned as subjects rather than citizens. If those royals choose to self-destruct, however, republicans are not going to complain. And the seeds of the royal implosion of the Nineties were sown long before, in the stubborn attempts of a blinkered, aristocratic, ultra-traditionalist mother to maintain class rubrics long past their sell-by date.</p> <p>Soon after her husband's premature death in 1952, aged only 56, the new Queen Mother's younger daughter fell in love with the devoted aide her late husband had fondly called 'the son I never had'.</p> <p>Group Captain Peter Townsend was in the throes of a divorce, a word then so taboo at court that divorc\u00e9s were not permitted to enter the royal enclosure at Ascot. No matter that there was no adultery involved; Townsend's marriage had faltered because of the long hours he spent at the palace, night after night, in the devoted service of the then king and queen.</p> <p>Margaret's mother wasn't having it. Beyond the dread spectre of divorce, of far more significance to this royal arriviste was the fact that Townsend had been a palace equerry, the king's aide-de-camp. Her daughter, in her eyes, wanted to marry a member of staff, an insupportable notion. Far from telling her so herself, she added to the burden of the young new queen by instructing her to forbid her sister to marry the man she loved.</p> <p>Margaret bit the bullet, and embarked on a notoriously wayward life as the requisite royal black sheep, only spared years later by the arrival of Fergie.</p> <p>With due irony, Margaret was eventually permitted to divorce the far less suitable man she married instead, the bohemian photographer Tony Armstrong-Jones (duly ennobled as Lord Snowdon). Equally ironic is the fact that Princess Anne's second husband was, of course, another Townsend, a royal equerry, Captain Tim Laurence, who knows his place as well as he knows how to mix her (and her granny's) Martinis. In truth, of course, equerries make perfect royal husbands.</p> <p>Consider the effect on any family, especially one whose patriarch has recently died, when the widow inserts an immediate, lifelong wedge between her only two daughters with so stern and heartless a diktat. But the 'imperial ostrich' syndrome, as some of her staff called the Queen Mother's reluctance to take responsibility for the results of her own brutal rulings, resurfaced again when Margaret eventually divorced Snowdon - and when Charles's marriage began to falter.</p> <p>The match between her favourite grandson and the granddaughter of her closest friend, Ruth, Lady Fermoy, was one the Queen Mother herself promoted, purely to see off the rival forces of her Greek-born son-in-law's dynastically ambitious uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten. The bisexual old seadog wanted Charles to marry his own granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull, a pretty, demure, intelligent girl who would have been a much more suitable wife for the agonised, introspective heir to the throne.</p> <p>She might even have won him away from Camilla, and so spared his mother a lot of grief, not to mention a constitutional crisis still waiting to happen.</p> <p>But it was not to be. The Queen Mother and her crony, so intent on her social connections as to have testified against her own daughter during her child-custody suit with Earl ('Johnny') Spencer, promoted a match both knew to be inappropriate.</p> <p>'You must understand that their sense of humour and lifestyle are different,' Lady Fermoy eventually told Diana, but not until it was too late. 'I don't think it will suit you.'</p> <p>She also discussed Charles's likely infidelity with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the late Lord Runcie, who agreed it was all 'rather sad, really', but married them all the same, despite knowing the truth about Charles, coining the famous 'fairy-tale' motif from his globally televised pulpit. Thus was the teenage bride dispatched, in her own poignant words, 'like a lamb to the slaughter'.</p> <p>When Charles duly betrayed her best friend's granddaughter, continuing his affair with a fellow officer's wife before, during and after their marriage, the Queen Mother betrayed all her apparent principles by condoning her grandson's adultery and taking his side against the girl she had trapped into marrying him.</p> <p>The heartlessness of her behaviour, her lack of sympathy for a fragile young woman who was never given the slightest chance, remains hard to square with the twinkling image of kindly moral rectitude so readily accepted by the world at large. No wonder postmarital Diana could not bear to be in the same room as the woman who had locked her in that gilded cage and thrown away the key.</p> <p>The former queen's ruthless streak was evident from the first, in her treatment of the Duchess of Windsor, whom she refused to receive even after the Duke's death, despite the diplomatic pleas of her own daughter (and monarch).</p> <p>For half a century after her own husband's death, in Clarence House, Windsor Lodge, Birkhall and the Castle of Mey, the widowed 'Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother' did not merely invent herself a title boasting two queens to her daughter's one. She preserved an otherwise vanished way of life befitting the last empress she had once been: a code founded on class dis tinction, and cushioned by a life of profligate comfort at the expense of the taxpayer, to whom, it seemed unfathomably, the old dear could do no wrong.</p> <p>Only octogenarians can still, perhaps, remember the Queen Mother as a middle-aged woman, stately before her time. Just as Diana will always be preserved in the memory in the full flush of youth, so the Queen Mother has always been a venerable old lady in the mind of most Britons, even those now past retirement age. It helped insulate her from criticism during prolonged open season on the rest of her family.</p> <p>But the crisis for the monarchy waiting to be precipitated by her eventual death will go way beyond the all too familiar, all too sordid dirty royal linen remorselessly paraded in recent years. The demise of the last queen-empress, etched in its potent symbolism by the gaunt cast of royal characters she will leave behind, will challenge Blair and his brave new Britain to re-evaluate itself yet again, to ask one more time what kind of country it wants to be. Can a Prime Minister who has finally flushed hereditary peers out of Parliament, amid complaints only about his plans for replacing them, seriously consider continuing to prop up a hereditary monarchy deprived of its last, most potent symbol, however illusory, of some sort of state of divine grace? Might not the self-styled 'radical' Blair, like the vast majority of his backbenchers and fellow countrymen, apply his own democratic logic to the office of head of state?</p> <p>The same arguments will undoubtedly pursue him all the way to Buckingham Palace and beyond. What kind of elected president are you going to impose on us? A clapped-out politician deprived of political power: Thatcher, Major, Jenkins, Owen, Ashdown, Kinnock, even Blair?

      "bodyText": "Codenamed Operation Lion, a classified document planning the Queen Mother's obsequies has been kicking around Whitehall for decades, constantly in need of revision as the fortunes of the monarchy faltered. The original in my possession, dating from the mid-Nineties, envisaged four days lying-in-state at the Palace of Westminster, followed by the biggest state funeral since Winston Churchill's in 1965. Television would 'go to black' as national life ground to a halt for a week or more - no EastEnders , no Coronation Street - in a nervous attempt to re-cement the monarchy's position at the heart of British life with a full-scale re-enactment of VE Day. In the early Nineties, soon after the Queen's 'annus horribilis' but long before Diana's death, I took part in a top-secret, all-day BBC rehearsal for the Solemn But Inevitable Day referred to only in the most hushed of tones. All normal programming was assumed 'cancelled' as Television Centre at White City was given over for an entire Sunday to 'live' updates from a sombre-voiced Jennie Bond outside Clarence House, amid copious footage of the Blitz as black-tied studio pundits debated with Peter Sissons the significance of the deceased to the British twentieth century. It was hard, frankly, to come up with much. I listened with disbelief as a woman who had never done a day's work in her life, who had blithely run up eight-figure overdrafts of the taxpayers' money on racehorses, had four palatial residences, 50 full-time servants and the pampered life of a latter-day Marie-Antoinette, was credited with winning the Second World War singlehanded. 'Now we can look the East End in the face,' the Queen Mother's much-quoted remark on surveying the rubble of a bombed wing of Buckingham Palace, served as a mantra of her pearly-queen hold over millions. I was not encouraged to quote the wry remark recently made to me by one disaffected courtier: 'She wouldn't even know where the East End was.' So I was heartened but unsurprised last week when Channel 4 chose to risk some home truths about the Queen Mother on the eve of her hundredth birthday. Even back then, before John Major's diehard monarchists gave way to Tony Blair's closet republicans, before Diana's abrupt demise poleaxed the people and put the wind up the Windsors, senior BBC executives realised that its plans for black-framed screens, half-mast flags and solemn music reeked absurdly of a Reithian Britain that no longer exists, of an unassailably secure monarchy uncritically beloved of its subjects. ITV (let alone Channel 4) would be taking a much more realistic approach - snappy documentary footage and respectful but objective assessments amid top-rated shows proceeding as usual - and so stealing the audience. The BBC's plans, like Operation Lion, were hastily sent back to the drawing-board. Then came Diana's death, precipitating some of the most dramatic scenes ever relayed by British television, and the general assumption that in death the people's princess had finally managed to upstage the grand old lady - her own grandmother's best friend - with whom she shared a strong mutual antipathy. 'The chief leper in the leper colony,' was how the princess once described to me over a gossipy lunch the woman Cecil Beaton had once called 'everyone's favourite granny'. But Diana's memory soon faded, thanks to sly co-operation between a newly slick Buckingham Palace public-relations machine and a disappointingly craven Downing Street, too timid to take on the monarchy as New Labour concentrated from day one on re-election. The Westminster Abbey heroics of Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, were cancelled out by his own seamy divorce, then his shameless commercial exploitation of her memory, before Britain gingerly began to re-examine itself, wondering quite what all the fuss had been about. As the Queen Mum soldiered gamely on, British life soon returned to normal, with her 1998 hip operation leading the BBC news as the Government contemplated war with Iraq. For the Windsors, too, it was soon back to business as usual - Charles now free to consort openly with his Camilla; William foxhunting in chip-off-the-old-block defiance of government policy and public opinion; the ageing Queen scowling at New Labour's jazzed-up version of her national anthem. This last was the central image of Blair's thrusting, 'modern' Britain, apart, of course, from a non-functioning ferris wheel and a Thames that failed to catch fire, broadcast to the world on millennium night from his tragi-comic, billion-pound Dome. When their private yacht was decommissioned - a floating embassy for Britain, if you believed Tory election propaganda - the Windsors pub licly shed the tears they had failed to find for the princess (supposedly because they were not given to public shows of emotion). Spared Diana's populist antics, the ex-officio FirstFamily could return to being their true selves, scarcely bothering to conceal their contempt for the focus groups and phony photo-opportunities - partying with pop stars, dropping in on pubs and council houses - laid on by the Government's eager-beaver spin-doctors. Which is why, amid the month and more of pomp and pageantry marking their matriarch's centenary, the Windsors should not take undue heart from the touching outpourings of affection due any human being on his or her hundredth birthday, let alone the glutinous 'God Bless You, Ma'am' forelock-tugging of the tabloids and the Daily Telegraph. Until very recently, it would have been unthinkable for the BBC to pass on live coverage of Wednesday's pageant in her honour, choosing to hand it to ITV rather than risk delaying Neighbours. Nor are courtiers too thrilled with Tony Blair for turning down the touching notion that her hundredth birthday should be declared a national holiday. These are signs of the times which are furrowing Palace brows as Operation Lion is scaled down yet again. Come that day, the Queen Mother's demise will turn out to be an even more pivotal moment than Diana's for the antique, irrational, ever more incongruous institution of hereditary monarchy. The widow of the wartime King George VI symbolised a moment in British history when this feudal tomfoolery was at its most deceptively potent. Without her, the bedraggled rump she leaves behind will be revealed for what it is - a spoilt, selfish bunch of interlopers, who have long since outstayed their welcome, holding Britain back from its potentially dynamic European future by encouraging it to cling, heedlessly and extravagantly, to decayed dreams of its imperial past, personified these days primarily by arrogant, xenophobic, football hooligans abroad. The irony, of course, is that the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, beloved by millions for reasons they themselves cannot quite articulate or understand, has always been the most spoilt and selfish of the lot. The daughter of a hereditary earl, just like Diana, she took a somewhat different approach to her marital good fortune, milking it for all the creature comforts with few of the responsibilities, fixing her eye on the throne as soon as her husband's older brother looked like putting love before duty, and crowding her unfortunate young daughters' freedom of movement after her husband's premature death. The young Miss Bowes-Lyon may have twice turned down proposals of marriage from the sweet, stammering, but unprepossessing Duke of York, but her eventual acceptance of his royal hand soon revealed quite as much flint as warmth in that celebrated heart of gold. Luckily for her, Lady Elizabeth married one of the few Windsor men never to look at another woman, so she was spared the heartache endured with averted eyes by most of the 'married' (as opposed to 'born') royals of generations both before and after her. She was unarguably the making of the reluctant King George VI, visibly (and self-confessedly) terrified as he was pitchforked on to the throne by his brother's abdication. With clinical determination, she organised the curing of his stammer and stage-managed his stand beside Churchill as a symbol of Britain's fortitude during the nightmare of protracted war. Amid the national crisis, it was swiftly forgotten that the pre-war king and queen had been devout appeasers, responsible for the most unconstitutional act of the century when they endorsed Neville Chamberlain and his Munich Agreement by escorting him on to the balcony of Buckingham Palace. And that the belligerent Churchill was the last man they wanted to see succeed him. Their swift change of political horses remains, of course, the reason why the generation which fought so manfully in that war always nursed the kind of devotion for the Queen Mum normally reserved by British manhood for its nannies or school matrons. This is why they chose to overlook her conspicuous human failings: her stubbornly cruel treatment of Wallis Simpson, 'the woman who killed my husband'; her wilful burial of her head in the sand during the domestic dramas of her own dysfunctional family; her key role in the casting of the Charles-Diana soap opera which brought the institution of monarchy to its knees. On 4 August 1900, this future queen-empress entered an already sepia world as another, Victoria, lay dying. Ladysmith had been relieved in February, and Mafeking in May. That year also saw the Labour Party founded, W.G. Grace retire from cricket, Puccini write Tosca, Joseph Conrad publish Lord Jim and Freud his Interpretation of Dreams. After a bumpy patch in the 1870s, when British republicanism reached a zenith it has never since approached, the monarchy had been craftily reinvented by Disraeli. Victoria's favourite Prime Minister turned around her rampant unpopularity, for living off the Civil List despite withdrawing from public life after her husband's early death, by casting her as the empress of a quarter of the world's population. Britain's imperial pride was suddenly embodied in this frail, old woman with the trumped-up title. Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon's father had handy connections at court. She was the ninth child of Claud, Lord Glamis, heir to the Earl of Strathmore and Lord-Lieutenant of Angus, a typical, old-school patrician of the period, said to hide a kind heart behind his gruff exterior and walrus moustache. As influential in the shaping of their youngest daughter's character was her mother, the former Celia Cavendish-Bentinck, kinswoman to the Duke of Portland. With the outbreak of the First World War, on Elizabeth's fourteenth birthday, Celia converted the family's ancestral Scottish pile, Glamis Castle, into a convalescent hospital. To the young Elizabeth, who combined her education in the social graces with cheering up the patients, the war meant 'knitting, knitting, knitting'. Thanks to her mother's example, she developed a brand of noblesse oblige which has stood her in good stead ever since, somehow persuading her social inferiors that, as toffs go, she was 'all right'. The pretty young aristocrat was able to enjoy five postwar years of the London debutante's life, including several racy love affairs, before marrying the shy, gauche Duke of York, second son of King George V, in April 1923. Their wedding in Westminster Abbey was the first there of a monarch's son since that of the future Richard II to Princess Anne of Bohemia more than 500 years before, thus establishing another twentieth-century myth, serially exploited by the Windsors, that royal nuptials must always be marked by glorious public ceremonies worthy of national holidays. At the time, a daring proposal from the BBC that the service be broadcast was vetoed by the dean and chapter of Westminster on the grounds that 'people might hear it while sitting in public houses, with their hats on'. Times change, and with them, when it can no longer avoid it, the monarchy. The sequence of events leading to Edward VIII's abdication in 1936 sparked a crisis which might have proved terminal, were it not for rather more important distractions in Europe. The rise of Adolf Hitler, to whom the exiled Duke of Windsor was soon making advances, proved the unlikely salvation of the family business he had so damaged. The cosy institution of the 'family monarchy' - initiated by Victoria, endangered by her adulterous son, Edward VII, but carefully rebuilt by the gruff George V and his curiously endearing stamp collection - now reached its zenith with portraits of the new queen pouring tea for her husband and daughters, for all the world as if they were just another English family, keeping the national upper lip stiff in the face of a common enemy. That war may have seen the rebirth of the monarchy as an institution around which an embattled nation could rally, but it also sealed the demise of the Empire which had underpinned it. For 50 more years, bowler-hatted stiffs and horny-handed sons of toil were strangely united in seeing the monarchy as a symbol of a bygone Britain of which they were reluctant to let go, a Britannia which, however unwilling they were to admit it, no longer ruled the waves. It was a Britain implicitly symbolised by the traditional, beyond-reproach figure of the seemingly eternal Queen Mother. Even when the younger royals began to discredit their elders, she somehow survived as a symbol of moral probity, above the fray, seemingly let down, no doubt mortally embarrassed by it all. Yet much of the blame can be laid at her firmly closed door. Few British republicans wish to see the monarchy fall because of the human failings of its transient, hereditary occupants. They have loftier ideals, centred around true notions of popular democracy and the civic rights of a people demeaned as subjects rather than citizens. If those royals choose to self-destruct, however, republicans are not going to complain. And the seeds of the royal implosion of the Nineties were sown long before, in the stubborn attempts of a blinkered, aristocratic, ultra-traditionalist mother to maintain class rubrics long past their sell-by date. Soon after her husband's premature death in 1952, aged only 56, the new Queen Mother's younger daughter fell in love with the devoted aide her late husband had fondly called 'the son I never had'. Group Captain Peter Townsend was in the throes of a divorce, a word then so taboo at court that divorc\u00e9s were not permitted to enter the royal enclosure at Ascot. No matter that there was no adultery involved; Townsend's marriage had faltered because of the long hours he spent at the palace, night after night, in the devoted service of the then king and queen. Margaret's mother wasn't having it. Beyond the dread spectre of divorce, of far more significance to this royal arriviste was the fact that Townsend had been a palace equerry, the king's aide-de-camp. Her daughter, in her eyes, wanted to marry a member of staff, an insupportable notion. Far from telling her so herself, she added to the burden of the young new queen by instructing her to forbid her sister to marry the man she loved. Margaret bit the bullet, and embarked on a notoriously wayward life as the requisite royal black sheep, only spared years later by the arrival of Fergie. With due irony, Margaret was eventually permitted to divorce the far less suitable man she married instead, the bohemian photographer Tony Armstrong-Jones (duly ennobled as Lord Snowdon). Equally ironic is the fact that Princess Anne's second husband was, of course, another Townsend, a royal equerry, Captain Tim Laurence, who knows his place as well as he knows how to mix her (and her granny's) Martinis. In truth, of course, equerries make perfect royal husbands. Consider the effect on any family, especially one whose patriarch has recently died, when the widow inserts an immediate, lifelong wedge between her only two daughters with so stern and heartless a diktat. But the 'imperial ostrich' syndrome, as some of her staff called the Queen Mother's reluctance to take responsibility for the results of her own brutal rulings, resurfaced again when Margaret eventually divorced Snowdon - and when Charles's marriage began to falter. The match between her favourite grandson and the granddaughter of her closest friend, Ruth, Lady Fermoy, was one the Queen Mother herself promoted, purely to see off the rival forces of her Greek-born son-in-law's dynastically ambitious uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten. The bisexual old seadog wanted Charles to marry his own granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull, a pretty, demure, intelligent girl who would have been a much more suitable wife for the agonised, introspective heir to the throne. She might even have won him away from Camilla, and so spared his mother a lot of grief, not to mention a constitutional crisis still waiting to happen. But it was not to be. The Queen Mother and her crony, so intent on her social connections as to have testified against her own daughter during her child-custody suit with Earl ('Johnny') Spencer, promoted a match both knew to be inappropriate. 'You must understand that their sense of humour and lifestyle are different,' Lady Fermoy eventually told Diana, but not until it was too late. 'I don't think it will suit you.' She also discussed Charles's likely infidelity with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the late Lord Runcie, who agreed it was all 'rather sad, really', but married them all the same, despite knowing the truth about Charles, coining the famous 'fairy-tale' motif from his globally televised pulpit. Thus was the teenage bride dispatched, in her own poignant words, 'like a lamb to the slaughter'. When Charles duly betrayed her best friend's granddaughter, continuing his affair with a fellow officer's wife before, during and after their marriage, the Queen Mother betrayed all her apparent principles by condoning her grandson's adultery and taking his side against the girl she had trapped into marrying him. The heartlessness of her behaviour, her lack of sympathy for a fragile young woman who was never given the slightest chance, remains hard to square with the twinkling image of kindly moral rectitude so readily accepted by the world at large. No wonder postmarital Diana could not bear to be in the same room as the woman who had locked her in that gilded cage and thrown away the key. The former queen's ruthless streak was evident from the first, in her treatment of the Duchess of Windsor, whom she refused to receive even after the Duke's death, despite the diplomatic pleas of her own daughter (and monarch). For half a century after her own husband's death, in Clarence House, Windsor Lodge, Birkhall and the Castle of Mey, the widowed 'Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother' did not merely invent herself a title boasting two queens to her daughter's one. She preserved an otherwise vanished way of life befitting the last empress she had once been: a code founded on class dis tinction, and cushioned by a life of profligate comfort at the expense of the taxpayer, to whom, it seemed unfathomably, the old dear could do no wrong. Only octogenarians can still, perhaps, remember the Queen Mother as a middle-aged woman, stately before her time. Just as Diana will always be preserved in the memory in the full flush of youth, so the Queen Mother has always been a venerable old lady in the mind of most Britons, even those now past retirement age. It helped insulate her from criticism during prolonged open season on the rest of her family. But the crisis for the monarchy waiting to be precipitated by her eventual death will go way beyond the all too familiar, all too sordid dirty royal linen remorselessly paraded in recent years. The demise of the last queen-empress, etched in its potent symbolism by the gaunt cast of royal characters she will leave behind, will challenge Blair and his brave new Britain to re-evaluate itself yet again, to ask one more time what kind of country it wants to be. Can a Prime Minister who has finally flushed hereditary peers out of Parliament, amid complaints only about his plans for replacing them, seriously consider continuing to prop up a hereditary monarchy deprived of its last, most potent symbol, however illusory, of some sort of state of divine grace? Might not the self-styled 'radical' Blair, like the vast majority of his backbenchers and fellow countrymen, apply his own democratic logic to the office of head of state? The same arguments will undoubtedly pursue him all the way to Buckingham Palace and beyond. What kind of elected president are you going to impose on us? A clapped-out politician deprived of political power: Thatcher, Major, Jenkins, Owen, Ashdown, Kinnock, even Blair? Or a populist Bransonesque president, selling Britain to the world? Anything but a boring old parliamentarian chosen by Parliament from among its own. That way, as in Australia, lies the monarchy's only hope of long-term survival. Come to that, do we really need a separate head of state, with all the concomitant fuss and expense, now that our elected Prime Ministers conduct their business in increasingly presidential style? Soon that debate will begin again in earnest, with the monarchy exposed to searching evaluation, deprived of the suspension of critical faculties the Queen Mother has so long inspired. Once her mother is no longer around to corner the role of royal matriarch, the elderly Queen herself will at last be perceived as the hidebound old lady she has imperceptibly become, intent on seeing out her reign without passing the baton to a gauche, adulterous, unpopular son with whom she herself is now at times in conflict. Soon the cracks in the Windsor edifice will begin to widen, offering reformers a long-awaited chance to free Britain of the unelected princelings cementing class and caste distinctions, barring the way to a truly popular democracy, and rendering this country a risible Ruritanian theme-park in the eyes of the free world. No one is suggesting that the Queen herself be ejected from the throne, just as her mother was so dramatically pitchforked on to it. With a discredited heir, however, and emotionally bruised grandchildren, who might just wind up sharing their contemporaries' bemused embarrassment at all things hereditary, not least a job apparently prone to ruining people's lives, a re-elected Blair with a reduced majority and no new ideas may well find his backbenchers finally giving voice to the growing tide of public opinion that it is, at last, time for Britain to grow up, take real pride in its cultural heritage and sweep away this thousand-year-old barrier to social progress. Suddenly, in the unaccustomed absence of her indestructible mother, the present Queen's own death may well come to seem the right moment to dispense with all this antique flummery, retire the rest of the royals with due dignity, and give Britain the chance to face the twenty-first century as the genuinely modernised democracy Blair has so long said he wants. It would be a fitting legacy for the last queen-empress.",

      "body": "<p>My garden awaits the arrival of the landscaper, whose bags of gravel and pots of herbs will transform my thistle-ridden rectangle into the fragrant urban sanctuary Monty Don and I hatched some weeks ago. </p> <p>I know exactly who I want to do it, but they are stuck on an earlier project and I must form an orderly queue. Yes, well, Christmas is coming, too, and I know very well there will be much mud and tears before so much as a sprig of thyme gets planted. I can dream about the roses that will climb the trellis, and if I screw my eyes tightly I can almost see the hornbeam hedges that will divide my little patch into 'rooms'. But even in this most sodden of summers, I have missed being able to walk out in the evening and pick the herbs to go in the day's salad. I long for my old herb patch with its tangle of lovage, purple sage and bindweed.</p> <p>The first summer for years I find myself without my rampant bushes of lemon verbena (they are as unstoppable as lovage when they get going) is also the summer that I find a lovely recipe for Verbena Tea in the new River Cafe Green (Ebury, \u00a330). This book has barely left my kitchen all summer, yet I would prefer to have picked the oregano, mint and thyme that season its dazzling vegetable recipes from my own patch rather than use spindle-stemmed sprigs from a supermarket pack. I would much rather do battle with the slugs for basil that has seen real sun than pinch a few limp-wristed leaves from one of those good-looking but ultimately toothless potted plants from Sainsbury's. I want herbs that have felt the rays of sun and that have grown in real earth.</p> <p>The sun is the crux of it all. Brush against a basil bush on holiday in Italy, or crush a tight bunch of thyme underfoot in Greece, and the scent wafts up into the air, its heady oils sticking to your clothes, your hands. Now sniff the little bouquet you have just bought in Tesco, and you get the message. Herbs are only really at their best when they have seen the glare of the sun. Have you ever snapped a twig of rosemary in a dry and sunny garden around lunchtime? That, and the smoke from a lamb chop on the grill, is as good as summer gets. While evidence points to getting the most flavour from herbs picked in early morning or evening, they seem infinitely more fragrant when their leaves are still warm from the sun.</p> <p>A herb garden, such as the one at Chelsea Physic Garden or the delightful Iden Croft Herbs near Staplehurst in Kent, is pure delight at the height of summer and it is only the thought of disturbing the bees that stops me from touching everything, releasing the essential oils that run through the leaves and stems as I do so. Yet it was under the spiffing new tent at this year's Chelsea Flower Show that I saw the most show-stopping herb garden I have seen in years. I may have been a grateful guest of those nice people at Laurent Perrier (and whose champagne I, of course, drink in preference to any other, and can I come again next year, please?), but it was the simpler pleasure of Highdown Nursery's herb patch (01273 492 976) that was worth suffering the rain and smell of beefburgers for. The star of their show was white borage, which I must say I never knew existed till then. Whereas there are those who would happily kill anyone thoughtless enough to actually want to touch the plants on their stall, this display almost begged us to. I wanted to take it, leaf, stem and root, back to my kitchen and scatter its magic over everything in sight. Once you start cooking with herbs, it is difficult not to get a touch carried away.</p> <p>Much of what we use herbs for is strewn throughout culinary history: rosemary with lamb, basil with tomatoes, etc. Such pairings are not news. But I have some ideas of my own that I never tire of. Mint with strawberries and passion fruit, for instance, or broad beans and (a little) sage. Then there is the basil I tear up and scatter over peas with a drizzle of olive oil, the bay leaves with which I infuse my custard, and the lemon balm I rub into lamb chops with salt and garlic before they hit the grill. </p> <p>I must tell you, too, about my habit of adding handfuls of big, peppery basil leaves and the juice of half a lemon to a pan of frying mushrooms (the smell is just sensational) and put in a word for the sage that I add, albeit gingerly, to my black pudding. I should also mention how nice basil is with raspberries. If you don't believe me, then wrap a couple of dark, velvety berries up in a leaf and crush it slowly on your tongue. </p> <p><strong>Herbed cream cheese</strong></p> <p>I know this sounds like one of those instant wonders from the back of a packet of Philly, but it is slightly more than that. If you take a bland cream cheese, such as a tub of mascarpone, and sharpen it with live yogurt and mix it with some freshly chopped herbs, you will have something worth making a few rounds of hot toast for. The recipe improves no end if you have time to leave the mixture overnight so that its flavour deepens and its texture stiffens up to something you can spread. It is also rather useful to serve alongside grilled meat. Use whichever herbs take your fancy. </p> <p><strong>400g mascarpone</strong></p> <p><strong>500ml live yogurt</strong></p> <p><strong>1 or 2 small cloves of young garlic </strong></p> <p><strong>6 tbsps of fresh herb leaves, finely chopped </strong></p> <p>Scoop the mascarpone into a mixing bowl and gently beat in the yogurt. Peel the garlic and crush it to a slush with a little salt, then incorporate it into the yogurt and cheese with the herbs. </p> <p>Line a small colander or sieve (or a yogurt pot which you have pierced with holes) with muslin or a new J cloth - it really must be a new one, though you should wet it first to make it more pliable.</p> <p>Pile the herb cheese into the lined container and set it to drain over a bowl.

The amount of tarragon you use is up to you, but you should start with a bunch of about 10 sprigs, adding a few more before the end of cooking. Some green beans and rice would be good here, too. Serves 4</p> <p><strong>8 chicken pieces on the bone, preferably thighs</strong></p> <p><strong>75g butter</strong></p> <p><strong>a wine glass of dry vermouth </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsps tarragon vinegar</strong></p> <p><strong>the leaves from a small bunch of tarragon</strong></p> <p><strong>300ml double cream</strong></p> <p><strong>a squeeze of lemon juice</strong></p> <p>Season the chicken pieces with a little salt and some ground black pepper, then melt the butter in a large, shallow pan over a moderate heat.

Return the chicken and its escaped juices to the pan, partially cover with a lid and set the heat quite low, so that the sauce bubbles gently around the chicken. Let it simmer like this for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time and checking that the cream does not thicken too much or stick to the bottom of the pan. If the cream looks in danger of becoming too thick - you want it to have the texture of a light cream sauce - then add <br>a little more vermouth. </p> <p>Check that the chicken is cooked - its juices should run clear, not pink, when the flesh is pierced with a skewer at its deepest point.

      "bodyText": "My garden awaits the arrival of the landscaper, whose bags of gravel and pots of herbs will transform my thistle-ridden rectangle into the fragrant urban sanctuary Monty Don and I hatched some weeks ago. I know exactly who I want to do it, but they are stuck on an earlier project and I must form an orderly queue. Yes, well, Christmas is coming, too, and I know very well there will be much mud and tears before so much as a sprig of thyme gets planted. I can dream about the roses that will climb the trellis, and if I screw my eyes tightly I can almost see the hornbeam hedges that will divide my little patch into 'rooms'. But even in this most sodden of summers, I have missed being able to walk out in the evening and pick the herbs to go in the day's salad. I long for my old herb patch with its tangle of lovage, purple sage and bindweed. The first summer for years I find myself without my rampant bushes of lemon verbena (they are as unstoppable as lovage when they get going) is also the summer that I find a lovely recipe for Verbena Tea in the new River Cafe Green (Ebury, \u00a330). This book has barely left my kitchen all summer, yet I would prefer to have picked the oregano, mint and thyme that season its dazzling vegetable recipes from my own patch rather than use spindle-stemmed sprigs from a supermarket pack. I would much rather do battle with the slugs for basil that has seen real sun than pinch a few limp-wristed leaves from one of those good-looking but ultimately toothless potted plants from Sainsbury's. I want herbs that have felt the rays of sun and that have grown in real earth. The sun is the crux of it all. Brush against a basil bush on holiday in Italy, or crush a tight bunch of thyme underfoot in Greece, and the scent wafts up into the air, its heady oils sticking to your clothes, your hands. Now sniff the little bouquet you have just bought in Tesco, and you get the message. Herbs are only really at their best when they have seen the glare of the sun. Have you ever snapped a twig of rosemary in a dry and sunny garden around lunchtime? That, and the smoke from a lamb chop on the grill, is as good as summer gets. While evidence points to getting the most flavour from herbs picked in early morning or evening, they seem infinitely more fragrant when their leaves are still warm from the sun. A herb garden, such as the one at Chelsea Physic Garden or the delightful Iden Croft Herbs near Staplehurst in Kent, is pure delight at the height of summer and it is only the thought of disturbing the bees that stops me from touching everything, releasing the essential oils that run through the leaves and stems as I do so. Yet it was under the spiffing new tent at this year's Chelsea Flower Show that I saw the most show-stopping herb garden I have seen in years. I may have been a grateful guest of those nice people at Laurent Perrier (and whose champagne I, of course, drink in preference to any other, and can I come again next year, please?), but it was the simpler pleasure of Highdown Nursery's herb patch (01273 492 976) that was worth suffering the rain and smell of beefburgers for. The star of their show was white borage, which I must say I never knew existed till then. Whereas there are those who would happily kill anyone thoughtless enough to actually want to touch the plants on their stall, this display almost begged us to. I wanted to take it, leaf, stem and root, back to my kitchen and scatter its magic over everything in sight. Once you start cooking with herbs, it is difficult not to get a touch carried away. Much of what we use herbs for is strewn throughout culinary history: rosemary with lamb, basil with tomatoes, etc. Such pairings are not news. But I have some ideas of my own that I never tire of. Mint with strawberries and passion fruit, for instance, or broad beans and (a little) sage. Then there is the basil I tear up and scatter over peas with a drizzle of olive oil, the bay leaves with which I infuse my custard, and the lemon balm I rub into lamb chops with salt and garlic before they hit the grill. I must tell you, too, about my habit of adding handfuls of big, peppery basil leaves and the juice of half a lemon to a pan of frying mushrooms (the smell is just sensational) and put in a word for the sage that I add, albeit gingerly, to my black pudding. I should also mention how nice basil is with raspberries. If you don't believe me, then wrap a couple of dark, velvety berries up in a leaf and crush it slowly on your tongue. Herbed cream cheese I know this sounds like one of those instant wonders from the back of a packet of Philly, but it is slightly more than that. If you take a bland cream cheese, such as a tub of mascarpone, and sharpen it with live yogurt and mix it with some freshly chopped herbs, you will have something worth making a few rounds of hot toast for. The recipe improves no end if you have time to leave the mixture overnight so that its flavour deepens and its texture stiffens up to something you can spread. It is also rather useful to serve alongside grilled meat. Use whichever herbs take your fancy. 400g mascarpone 500ml live yogurt 1 or 2 small cloves of young garlic 6 tbsps of fresh herb leaves, finely chopped Scoop the mascarpone into a mixing bowl and gently beat in the yogurt. Peel the garlic and crush it to a slush with a little salt, then incorporate it into the yogurt and cheese with the herbs. Line a small colander or sieve (or a yogurt pot which you have pierced with holes) with muslin or a new J cloth - it really must be a new one, though you should wet it first to make it more pliable. Pile the herb cheese into the lined container and set it to drain over a bowl. If you can, leave it overnight in the fridge, though I must say I have left it for only a couple of hours before now, and it has firmed up nicely. Once the cheese and yogurt mixture has thickened to the point where you can spread it, discard the liquid that has seeped out into the bowl and unmould the herbed cheese. Serve it with hot toast. Chicken with vermouth, tarragon and cream If I can steer myself away from the grill at this time of year, then it will be to a simple chicken saut\u00e9 such as this one with tarragon and cream. The amount of tarragon you use is up to you, but you should start with a bunch of about 10 sprigs, adding a few more before the end of cooking. Some green beans and rice would be good here, too. Serves 4 8 chicken pieces on the bone, preferably thighs 75g butter a wine glass of dry vermouth 2 tbsps tarragon vinegar the leaves from a small bunch of tarragon 300ml double cream a squeeze of lemon juice Season the chicken pieces with a little salt and some ground black pepper, then melt the butter in a large, shallow pan over a moderate heat. Lightly brown the chicken in the butter, taking care that the butter does not burn. If it does, then you need to wipe out the pan and start again with some fresh butter. Remove the chicken, tip off and discard most of the butter and put the pan back on the heat. Pour the vermouth and the vinegar into the pan, and as the steam rises, scrape away at the sticky deposits in the pan with a wooden spoon, letting them dissolve into the wine. Once the vermouth has reduced for a minute or so, bubbling away by about a third, add the tarragon leaves and the cream and stir them into the wine. Return the chicken and its escaped juices to the pan, partially cover with a lid and set the heat quite low, so that the sauce bubbles gently around the chicken. Let it simmer like this for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring from time to time and checking that the cream does not thicken too much or stick to the bottom of the pan. If the cream looks in danger of becoming too thick - you want it to have the texture of a light cream sauce - then add a little more vermouth. Check that the chicken is cooked - its juices should run clear, not pink, when the flesh is pierced with a skewer at its deepest point. Season with salt, a little black pepper, and a squeeze or two of lemon juice to sharpen and lift, or another dash of tarragon vinegar. Raspberry and lemon verbena fool Serves 4 a small handful of lemon verbena leaves 2 tbsps caster sugar 400g raspberries 200ml whipping cream Mash the verbena with the sugar, using a pestle and mortar. Crush the raspberries with a fork, then stir them into the herb sugar. Gently whip the cream until thick - though not so thick that it won't fall easily from the whisk - then fold it into the fruit. Pile into glasses and leave to chill for half an hour before serving.",

      "body": "<p>Seventeen summers ago this year I, and around a dozen of my school friends, officially became juvenile delinquents. We were the Euan Blairs of our day, albeit without the vomit and the police cautions. For the sin of smoking marijuana during a party held to celebrate the end of a school play, a production of the Taming of the Shrew , we were each of us suspended and, in one case, removed altogether from the two expensive Haberdashers Aske's schools for boys and girls that sit next door to each other in Elstree, Hertfordshire. </p> <p>It didn't matter that the party had been held in a private house. As an embassy becomes the territory of the country it represents, so the house became school grounds. We were out. And how. </p> <p>There were national newspaper headlines. There was intrigue. Other pupils were told by their parents not to associate with us. We had gone to the bad and, as far as they could see, we weren't coming back again any time soon. True, the police did not become involved but that didn't matter; a special place had been reserved for us all in the gutter, the better to view the stars. </p> <p>This afternoon, to mark the retirement of the much-loved teacher who directed the drama that preceded the greater drama, many of us will be together again on school grounds for the first time in half a lifetime. The gathering has presented us at last with the chance to answer a simple question; the question that anybody who has ever faced the grinding, totalitarian wrath of school authority needs to ask. And it is this: what became of us? </p> <p>Well, we are journalists and lawyers now, teachers and shrinks and film makers. Some of us work in theatre, though none of us turned out to be good enough to hack it on stage. There are no reports of track marks up our arms and precious little time has been spent in that gutter. It appears that we survived. And yet those curious events 17 years ago have left their mark. It seems that, like kippers and garlic bread, bitter experiences of school have a way of repeating on you. </p> <p>Today Simon Reade is literary manager of the Royal Shakespeare Company. (A production of Ted Hughes' s Tales from Ovid, which he co-adapted, is playing at the Young Vic, in London.) In 1983 he was suspended for just one week, for coughing early to the crime of smoking somebody else's dope at the party. 'It was a very important event in my life,' he says now. </p> <p>'Not because of the minor offence, but because of the sledgehammer that was used to smash it. It made me grow up very quickly and realise that institutions have no idea how to deal with people.' Most of all, he says, it made him realise he was on his own. 'It sent out the signal that the school couldn't cope with real human beings.' </p> <p>Adrian Levy, a national newspaper journalist who has worked for this paper and others, agrees. 'The school spent an enormous amount of time trying to portray us as the untouchables, the lowest of the low,' Adrian says. He was due to take his A-levels just as he was being suspended. Under the terms of his punishment every day that he had an exam he had to be escorted on and off the grounds by two teachers. </p> <p>'They were hardly the best circumstances in which to take A-levels,' he says. 'And I don't think I achieved the results that I could have done. For a couple of years it all made me much more suspicious of people. I became quite cynical at a time when I should have been filled with optimism.' </p> <p>Perhaps most curious are those people who, despite their journey into adulthood lasting almost two decades, still do not feel they can afford to have their names published for fear of any professional damage a connection with the affair might do them. One is a former pupil at the boy's school who has gone into teaching at a similar type of public school. </p> <p>'I did feel hard done by about the way I was treated,' he says now. 'Because I don't think I had more than a few puffs. And at the time I remember thinking that it was all going to have a seriously detrimental effect on my future.' So why, in God's name, help support that kind of school system by now working for it?

Having been informed by the girls' school that, unbeknown to her, she had been on probation for the previous year, she was invited to leave or be expelled. So she went, jeopardising her chances of completing her A-levels. The syllabus she was halfway through was unavailable at alternative schools. It didn't matter: they just wanted her gone. </p> <p>Today she is a successful barrister. 'It had a monumental impact upon me,' she says. 'I was in a classic period of adolescence. Having got to 16, cocky and confident, it both destabilised me and it politicised me enormously. I was suddenly confronted by the hypocrisy of power and authority. I actually think the combination of that sensitive age and the event itself threw me for about 10 years. It didn't stop me getting on, but I did become lacking in confidence.' And then she jogs a memory: that we only bought dope for the party because we knew it would be an all-night affair and that, if we stuck to booze, we'd all get drunk far too quickly; that, in short, we'd end up doing a Euan Blair. 'So we thought we'd just be quiet, civilised, mellow and stoned.' </p> <p>The head boy in waiting, who was also in the play, declined to follow that route. He got very drunk, suffered acute alcohol poisoning and spent the entire party throwing up. No disciplinary action was taken against him. Today he is a teacher of religious studies back at the girls' school. </p> <p>As for me, my punishment was the longest suspension of all: four months from early in the summer term to the following September, though I can no longer remember exactly why. By dint of my mother's renown as a dispenser of emotional and medical advice in newspaper columns, the story quickly made the press.

He concluded that the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 had led to concerns that a second Holocaust could occur and that there was a duty to remember the events of the Second World War to stop such an atrocity occurring again.

This newspaper echoed his views on the problems of over-stating the uniqueness of the Holocaust when the Imperial War Museum opened its permanent Holocaust Exhibition a few weeks ago. Likewise journalist Tom Bower, who has written extensively on attempts to get compensation from the Swiss over the Holocaust, says some of what Finkelstein claims about the machinations of the international compensation process are correct. </p> <p>The idea of a Holocaust racket surfaced years ago when Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban quipped: 'There's no business like Shoah business' ('Shoah' is Hebrew for 'Holocaust'). </p> <p>Rabbi Julia Neuberger says: 'There is a sort of industry going on around the Holocaust which grows on itself.

'His facts are wrong. His language is intemperate.

'In the book he says that by writing about Holocaust deniers I give them credence. That's ridiculous. I didn't create them.' At one point he accuses Lipstadt - also in the UK for the Oxford conference - of saying that doubting the testimony of survivors is a form of Holocaust denial. 'I never said that,' she said. 'It's ridiculous. It makes me wonder how accurate he is on other things.' </p> <p>It is certainly true that Finkelstein only emphasises that which suits his case. He mentions repeatedly that his mother received only $3,500 by way of compensation, but buries in a footnote the fact that his father received a monthly pension of around $600 for years. </p> <p>Indeed, gripes about money, and the Byzantine compensation claims that procured it, appear to lie at the very heart of Finkelstein's argument. In 1998, Swiss banks agreed to pay $1.25 billion in settlement of a class action brought by Jewish claimants. </p> <p>Finkelstein complains that no money reached the victims. Tom Bower, who has written extensively on Swiss compensation to the Jews, disagrees. 'None of the Swiss's $1.25bn has been transferred to any Jewish organisation,' he says. 'So far, the American courts have not approved a system for distributing the money and no money has been transferred from Switzerland.' Finkelstein claims that the World Jewish Congress now has a fund of $7bn. 'The $7bn fund is a myth,' says Bower. Finally Finkelstein states that half a $200 million fund set up for immediate distribution to victims has not been handed out and will end up going to Jewish groups and lawyers. Elan Steinberg of the WJC says this is rubbish. Only on one claim, that there are tens of millions of dollars in German compensation funds languishing in bank accounts, does Bower say that Finkelstein's account come anywhere near the truth. Even so he says Finkelstein's interpretation of those events is 'flawed'. </p> <p>Finkelstein is unrepentant. 'When I want to invoke the memory of my parents I am accused of using it. There is something plainly revolting going on. There are people claiming to be working in the name of Holocaust victims, getting money on false pretences and then not distributing it. </p> <p>'I was probably unusually close to my parents so I do what I can now to preserve the integrity of their memory.

      "bodyText": "As Norman Finkelstein's flight from New York touches down tomorrow morning in London, it lands the Brooklyn-born writer and Holocaust academic in the middle of a major storm. As he arrives, one of Finkelstein's many enemies in the Jewish Establishment, and one of many targets in his latest book, will be addressing a major international Holocaust conference in Oxford. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, the Nobel-prize winning author whose book Night is held as one of the most important of Holocaust texts, is one of the major speakers at the Remembering for the Future conference. So is Finkelstein, who says Wiesel is a hypocrite, responsible for the 'sacralisation of the Holocaust ... for his standard fee of $25,000 (plus chauffeured limousine)'. It is believed the fierce foes are unlikely to come face to face in Oxford, but Finkelstein will sail into a storm of controversy there as his new book The Holocaust Industry is published in the UK. Last week, it was condemned here as 'nauseous'. Some columnists branded him 'extreme' and a 'conspiracy theorist'. Others damned him for giving succour to anti-Semites and manipulating the facts. Norman Finkelstein, the son of concentration camp survivors, has launched a personal pogrom with The Holocaust Industry, attacking almost every orthodox tenet of the study of the genocide of the Jews by the Nazis.

      "body": "<p>You can tell when summer is properly here when the lower leaves of the fennel turn yellow. They hang like trailing underskirts and the lowest leaves are now a shrivelled brown memory of their green selves. Then, for the next couple of feet, there is a yolky tinge on leaves that are almost bushy and foxtailed. The layer above that has a more open structure, just the very tip flushing yellow. And finally, the fresh leaves are a lighter green that will, when the plant stops growing about now, steadily turn darker until they, too, go the yellow way of all leaves.</p> <p> By the end of summer, these will be plates of dried, aniseed-flavoured seeds. I have often seen them in their natural Mediterranean scrub struggling to reach more than 4ft tall with bleached and feeble leaves wispily hanging off the few dried sticks that constitute its stems. These sticks are used as fuel for grilling fish and infuse the meat with a wonderful and completely idiosyncratic smoky fennelness, but as a decorative garden plant they would be mean. However, in our heavy loam, fennel is a stately plant, frothing with leaves and growing to 6ft or more, and is an important part of the flower borders as well as the herb garden.</p> <p>The bronze version is a less statuesque plant, but better in detail. It is probably part of the subspecies Foeniculum vulgare piperitum and is hardly bronze at all, except when young or in spring when the new leaves appear, but still dark enough to work even better with intense colours in the border than its green version. You might describe the stem as oxidised bronze with a grey patina with which the chalky green flanges around the leaf stalks contrast vividly. </p> <p>When the young leaves emerge they are the same colour as the stem, but change fairly quickly to a smoky green, although the ends go bright orange before fading to yellow. It is more fussy in its growing requirements than its green counterpart, but in my experience all bronze or purple versions of Mediterranean plants, such as purple sage and purple basil, are less tolerant of winter wet and much slower to get going in spring. It is also slow to establish in its first year and likely not to last long beyond its second or third season, but is worth persevering with. </p> <p> You are bound to lose some plants every winter, especially if it is wet and cold (many Mediterranean plants will cope with just cold or just wet, but the combination of both is the killer). We sow a packet of seed every year and prick out about 4 dozen plants from that, which just about keeps us in bronze fennel to the level to which we have become accustomed. Fennel is a perennial, but each plant is best dug up and replaced every three or four years, or divided so that the younger offshoots on the outside are replanted and the centre section chucked.</p> <p> However much it thrives in a rich loam compared to a blazing Mediterranean hillside, it still likes an open, sunny site and its very deep, fleshy roots need good drainage. If you have heavy soil, it is best to add grit when you plant it out. You can, of course, sow it directly where it is to grow, but unless you are prepared to thin radically, it is easier to buy plants or raise the seeds under cover.</p> <p> But once you have a few plants in the garden, you are unlikely to need to buy any more green fennel because it seeds itself so freely. This is not a problem, as long as you do not have fennel as a fixed part of a rigid planting scheme. It is best left to float around the garden, often appearing in paths and cracks where you don't want it, but equally making a happy appearance where it works as the perfect, hazy green foil to roses, poppies, or any of the stronger, summer-flowering border plants.</p> <p> Fennel has been used to stave off hunger from Roman times through to the American Puritans who took it with them to long church services to defeat the cravings - for food - that attacked them during prayer. It was one of the many stewing herbs used in medieval times to ward off the stench of daily life and it also warded off flies, so was used in the kitchen and at table as much for its prophylactic, hygienic properties as for its taste. Like all umbellifers, it is very useful in the garden as an attractant to hoverflies which in turn eat aphids. </p> <p> Nowadays, it's used as gripe water for babies and I often munch on the seeds to calm my tummy. Medicinal or not, fennel is always delicious. One of my favourite dishes is roasted pork coated in fennel seeds and cooked on a bed of fennel stalks and leaves. Florence fennel, or finocchio, has evolved - with a lot of help from breeders - from the ordinary herb fennel to a vegetable. The base is swollen and forms an overlapping succession of layers, like a bulb. The fennel you buy in shops is always twice as big as my efforts, but this year the combination of timing, plenty of water and general warmth seems to be doing the trick. It is very easy to let it run to seed before the bulbs swell out to any appreciable size, especially if you sow before midsummer as they are sensitive to changing day length.</p> <p> The secret is to grow it as fast as possible. Any check at any stage in its growth seems to activate a hair trigger and set it bolting. I grow it in plugs in the greenhouse which I then pot on into 3in pots and then plant out. 'Perfection' (sometimes called 'Mammoth Perfection') is the slowest to bolt and so probably the best variety to grow if you can get hold of it.</p> <p> Although related to the common fennel, the Giant Fennel, Ferula, is not good to eat and has hardly any fragrance. What it loses in tastiness it makes up for in sheer size. F communis reaches 8ft tall with enormous, finely threaded leaves and huge flower spikes. We bought one last year and planted it expecting it to explode into a pumped-up version of the fennels that already grow all over the garden. Nothing happened. It didn't die and yet scarcely deigned to show any interest in life. This year, it is growing more slowly, but as yet does not seem entirely convinced that it actually wants to play the game.</p> <p> Is this normal? The RHS encyclopedia says that it 'may take several years to flower' and Noel Kingsbury in his book Dramatic Effects with Architectural Plants (Mitchell Beazley, \u00a316.99), says it 'takes several years before it grows its 3m flower stem'. I would add that it takes several years to do anything much at all. What is for certain is that it dies after it flowers, so you have to collect the seed and sow them in the autumn.We also bought a couple of F tinginata 'Cedric Morris', which is half the size of F communis and with less finely cut leaves. Or would have been if they had not both died. I think the answer, as with so much in this life, is more grit. </p> <p><strong>My roots</strong><br></p> <p>I am writing this in our newly converted hop-kiln, with a dunce's cap of a ceiling rising to a cone 20ft above my head. The windows have not yet been fitted, so there are temporary sheets of corrugated Perspex. I use the same stuff for our cold frames and they serve that job very well. The effect in this room is to let in lots of milky light, but no actual images.</p> <p> As I work, I can just see the wavy outline of trees and sunlight, but no garden as yet. At times, it feels like an apt analogy for my life at the moment. However, I did manage to grab a couple of hours planting in the Jewel garden with Gareth and Sarah, who have both done a mammoth clear out of the 12 borders. It is a pivotal moment in this garden when we clear the cold frames and standing areas of all the tender annuals we have been growing since March and get things into the ground at last. This includes tithonias (a bit feeble this year), leonotis, Nicotiana sylvestris, Cerinthe major, tropaeolum, zinnias and cosmos. I planted a couple of purple hazels which are dwarfed at the moment, but will kick in in a year or so. </p> <p> I remember seeing purple hazel used really well in a border at Kiftsgate court five years ago and have been meaning to plant one as a border shrub ever since. Sarah pulled up loads of orache, which is fabulous but overwhelming if you don't get severe with it before it seeds. Alongside the orache, in self-seeded glory, is Verbena bonariensis, which is growing fast and plays an important role in this garden.</p> <p> I mowed all our grass the other day, which I don't often do. It is a much derided bit of gardening, condemned to a harmless, blokish image, necessary but utterly uncreative. Not true. Not only is it important for the way the garden looks, but it is also one of those things where the mind slips into a kind of neutral hot tub. The slowness of the pace is good, too, winding the experience of the garden down to a crawl, which is so different from the snatched business of a lot of my time.</p> <p> Last year, because we were filming in the garden every few weeks, I kept strictly on top of all hedge cutting and topiary. This year, I have been laxer and have enjoyed the soft edges everywhere. But soft has become intrusive and we have begun the round of hedgecutting. Immediately edges appear and make a staggering transformation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You can tell when summer is properly here when the lower leaves of the fennel turn yellow. They hang like trailing underskirts and the lowest leaves are now a shrivelled brown memory of their green selves. Then, for the next couple of feet, there is a yolky tinge on leaves that are almost bushy and foxtailed. The layer above that has a more open structure, just the very tip flushing yellow. And finally, the fresh leaves are a lighter green that will, when the plant stops growing about now, steadily turn darker until they, too, go the yellow way of all leaves. By the end of summer, these will be plates of dried, aniseed-flavoured seeds. I have often seen them in their natural Mediterranean scrub struggling to reach more than 4ft tall with bleached and feeble leaves wispily hanging off the few dried sticks that constitute its stems. These sticks are used as fuel for grilling fish and infuse the meat with a wonderful and completely idiosyncratic smoky fennelness, but as a decorative garden plant they would be mean. However, in our heavy loam, fennel is a stately plant, frothing with leaves and growing to 6ft or more, and is an important part of the flower borders as well as the herb garden. The bronze version is a less statuesque plant, but better in detail. It is probably part of the subspecies Foeniculum vulgare piperitum and is hardly bronze at all, except when young or in spring when the new leaves appear, but still dark enough to work even better with intense colours in the border than its green version. You might describe the stem as oxidised bronze with a grey patina with which the chalky green flanges around the leaf stalks contrast vividly. When the young leaves emerge they are the same colour as the stem, but change fairly quickly to a smoky green, although the ends go bright orange before fading to yellow. It is more fussy in its growing requirements than its green counterpart, but in my experience all bronze or purple versions of Mediterranean plants, such as purple sage and purple basil, are less tolerant of winter wet and much slower to get going in spring. It is also slow to establish in its first year and likely not to last long beyond its second or third season, but is worth persevering with. You are bound to lose some plants every winter, especially if it is wet and cold (many Mediterranean plants will cope with just cold or just wet, but the combination of both is the killer). We sow a packet of seed every year and prick out about 4 dozen plants from that, which just about keeps us in bronze fennel to the level to which we have become accustomed. Fennel is a perennial, but each plant is best dug up and replaced every three or four years, or divided so that the younger offshoots on the outside are replanted and the centre section chucked. However much it thrives in a rich loam compared to a blazing Mediterranean hillside, it still likes an open, sunny site and its very deep, fleshy roots need good drainage. If you have heavy soil, it is best to add grit when you plant it out. You can, of course, sow it directly where it is to grow, but unless you are prepared to thin radically, it is easier to buy plants or raise the seeds under cover. But once you have a few plants in the garden, you are unlikely to need to buy any more green fennel because it seeds itself so freely. This is not a problem, as long as you do not have fennel as a fixed part of a rigid planting scheme. It is best left to float around the garden, often appearing in paths and cracks where you don't want it, but equally making a happy appearance where it works as the perfect, hazy green foil to roses, poppies, or any of the stronger, summer-flowering border plants. Fennel has been used to stave off hunger from Roman times through to the American Puritans who took it with them to long church services to defeat the cravings - for food - that attacked them during prayer. It was one of the many stewing herbs used in medieval times to ward off the stench of daily life and it also warded off flies, so was used in the kitchen and at table as much for its prophylactic, hygienic properties as for its taste. Like all umbellifers, it is very useful in the garden as an attractant to hoverflies which in turn eat aphids. Nowadays, it's used as gripe water for babies and I often munch on the seeds to calm my tummy. Medicinal or not, fennel is always delicious. One of my favourite dishes is roasted pork coated in fennel seeds and cooked on a bed of fennel stalks and leaves. Florence fennel, or finocchio, has evolved - with a lot of help from breeders - from the ordinary herb fennel to a vegetable. The base is swollen and forms an overlapping succession of layers, like a bulb. The fennel you buy in shops is always twice as big as my efforts, but this year the combination of timing, plenty of water and general warmth seems to be doing the trick. It is very easy to let it run to seed before the bulbs swell out to any appreciable size, especially if you sow before midsummer as they are sensitive to changing day length. The secret is to grow it as fast as possible. Any check at any stage in its growth seems to activate a hair trigger and set it bolting. I grow it in plugs in the greenhouse which I then pot on into 3in pots and then plant out. 'Perfection' (sometimes called 'Mammoth Perfection') is the slowest to bolt and so probably the best variety to grow if you can get hold of it. Although related to the common fennel, the Giant Fennel, Ferula, is not good to eat and has hardly any fragrance. What it loses in tastiness it makes up for in sheer size. F communis reaches 8ft tall with enormous, finely threaded leaves and huge flower spikes. We bought one last year and planted it expecting it to explode into a pumped-up version of the fennels that already grow all over the garden. Nothing happened. It didn't die and yet scarcely deigned to show any interest in life. This year, it is growing more slowly, but as yet does not seem entirely convinced that it actually wants to play the game. Is this normal? The RHS encyclopedia says that it 'may take several years to flower' and Noel Kingsbury in his book Dramatic Effects with Architectural Plants (Mitchell Beazley, \u00a316.99), says it 'takes several years before it grows its 3m flower stem'. I would add that it takes several years to do anything much at all. What is for certain is that it dies after it flowers, so you have to collect the seed and sow them in the autumn.We also bought a couple of F tinginata 'Cedric Morris', which is half the size of F communis and with less finely cut leaves. Or would have been if they had not both died. I think the answer, as with so much in this life, is more grit. My roots I am writing this in our newly converted hop-kiln, with a dunce's cap of a ceiling rising to a cone 20ft above my head. The windows have not yet been fitted, so there are temporary sheets of corrugated Perspex. I use the same stuff for our cold frames and they serve that job very well. The effect in this room is to let in lots of milky light, but no actual images. As I work, I can just see the wavy outline of trees and sunlight, but no garden as yet. At times, it feels like an apt analogy for my life at the moment. However, I did manage to grab a couple of hours planting in the Jewel garden with Gareth and Sarah, who have both done a mammoth clear out of the 12 borders. It is a pivotal moment in this garden when we clear the cold frames and standing areas of all the tender annuals we have been growing since March and get things into the ground at last. This includes tithonias (a bit feeble this year), leonotis, Nicotiana sylvestris, Cerinthe major, tropaeolum, zinnias and cosmos. I planted a couple of purple hazels which are dwarfed at the moment, but will kick in in a year or so. I remember seeing purple hazel used really well in a border at Kiftsgate court five years ago and have been meaning to plant one as a border shrub ever since. Sarah pulled up loads of orache, which is fabulous but overwhelming if you don't get severe with it before it seeds. Alongside the orache, in self-seeded glory, is Verbena bonariensis, which is growing fast and plays an important role in this garden. I mowed all our grass the other day, which I don't often do. It is a much derided bit of gardening, condemned to a harmless, blokish image, necessary but utterly uncreative. Not true. Not only is it important for the way the garden looks, but it is also one of those things where the mind slips into a kind of neutral hot tub. The slowness of the pace is good, too, winding the experience of the garden down to a crawl, which is so different from the snatched business of a lot of my time. Last year, because we were filming in the garden every few weeks, I kept strictly on top of all hedge cutting and topiary. This year, I have been laxer and have enjoyed the soft edges everywhere. But soft has become intrusive and we have begun the round of hedgecutting. Immediately edges appear and make a staggering transformation.",

But even sources close to United acknowledged that there would have to be an improvement in the merger terms for Carlton for it to progress. The Competition Commission's recommendation, endorsed by Byers, that United would have to sell its South East region Meridian franchise - valued at around \u00a3700 million - will enable Green to demand improved terms. The likelihood of a hostile bid by Granada Media for United was emerging as the most likely scenario this weekend, as a number of City analysts claimed that the Carlton United tie-up was 'as good as dead'. Despite intense speculation on Friday that other bidders may emerge for the company, including the RTL Group, backed by Pearson and Bertelsmann, investment banking sources said that this was 'wide of the mark'; the attention was centring on what Granada would do next. Its chairman, Charles Allen, is unlikely to make a move until the situation between Carlton and United has been clarified. Whatever the outcome, Allen, as the only serious potential buyer, is likely to end up holding a further major franchise in the shape of Meridian. Speculation is also mounting over who would bid for the ownership of the Express newspaper titles if United News were to be broken up. Trinity Mirror is thought to have shown interest; and rumours that the Barclay brothers, who own the Scotsman , Scotland on Sunday and Sunday Business, are willing to sell them, has led to further speculation that, although previously turned down by Hollick, they may try again for the Express titles.",

      "body": "<p>Sitting on a garden bench - the sun, dappled by trees, streaming onto the lawn - it all seems impossibly far away. It is impossibly far away. </p> <p> The corpse was the worst thing we'd ever seen, utterly blackened by now, the skin on the face drawn back tightly like stretched leather, so that all his teeth showed. </p> <p> A light, warm breeze blows into his face and Michael Herr, master of war journalism, pulls down the peak of his baseball cap. It's not just that those who line up to praise his book, Dispatches , above all others include John le Carr\u00e9, William Burroughs and Tom Wolfe, it is that he invented a genre, a new way of writing about war, the cruelty of war, the pity of war and the savage, hollow laugh of the warrior. </p> <p> It was at this point that I began to recognise every casualty, remember conversations we'd had days or even hours earlier, and that's when I left, riding a medevac with a lieutenant who was covered with blood-soaked bandages. He'd been hit in both legs, both arms the chest and head, his ears and eyes were full of caked blood, and he asked a photographer in the chopper to take a picture of him like this to send to his wife. </p> <p> Now, Herr says, he has 'cleaned it all out. People keep asking me to go and write about war for them. I say: \"Haven't you read my fucking book? What the fuck would I want to go and do that for?\" Publishers keep sending me books about Vietnam; I wish they'd stop. I'm not interested in Vietnam. It has passed clean through me'. </p> <p>Instead, Herr has just produced a book about one of the most remarkable encounters to come out of his time in Vietnam - his friendship with Stanley Kubrick. It thereby blends the two boldest influences in Herr's living past (family apart). The third and present influence, and the most intriguing, is 'the reason why I did clean out and why I'm not crazy any more' - that will unfold later on during the conversation on the garden bench, with Herr swirling a mug of coffee round and round, and smoking half a cigarette at a time. </p> <p> Kubrick is Herr's first volume since his strange and brilliant book about the life and death of the radio broadcaster Walter Winchell. Kubrick is a captivating little book rather like an Arthur Miller play: it plays out on a small scale, but invokes the epic themes of friendship, art, sex and war. It is intimate, honest and affectionate to the point of being able to say: 'I don't want to give the impression that I didn't get extremely irritated, that I never thought he was a cheap prick that his demands and requirements weren't just TOO MUCH.' </p> <p>And there's this gratifying insight: 'They say [Kubrick] had no personal life,' writes Herr of his friend, 'but that's ridiculous. It would be more correct to say that he had no professional life, since everything he did was personally done.' Actually, this is a rather good description of Michael Herr. </p> <p>Herr works in a bat-cave. His office is a tiny room in an otherwise spacious house amid the rolling hills of upstate New York, a dark corner in a home otherwise bathed in natural light. The 'office' walls are piled from floor to ceiling with music and books. Wagner, Mozart, Coltrane, Monteverdi and Shostakovich climb up one wall, while Kierkegaard, Cicero, Austen, Nietzsche and the Russian classics fight for shelf space up three others. 'And you know what?' he says with a grin. 'I could throw it all away tomorrow and not notice. I am cleaning it all out. Cleaning everything out.' That is both the beginning and the end of the conversation, also the point of departure along his long road to meeting, and now writing about, Stanley Kubrick. The road to Full Metal Jacket that begins in Vietnam. </p> <p>Herr went to Vietnam 'as part of the decade thing. I had done the decade, and it had to end in Vietnam'. He had moved to Manhattan from his home town of Syracuse, to a teeming Greenwich Village where he commuted between his apartment and Bill Graham's Fillmore East rock venue: 'Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane and everyone except the Beatles.' </p> <p>He wrote for the pioneering Holiday magazine, also famous for the work of Hemingway, Faulkner, V.S. Pritchett and Saul Bellow. But it was for Howard Hayes's then trail-blazing Esquire that Herr went to South-east Asia. One soldier asked Herr if he had 'come to report on what we're wearing'. 'I needed the accreditation,' explains Herr, 'and Hayes was okay with that.' </p> <p>Every writer who has tried his or her hand at war journalism (myself included) would go to meet Michael Herr rather like a student of the cello would approach Mstislav Rostropovtch. Apart from learning by listening, the gratifying thing is to find that one's own follies and fears are echoes of Herr's; one almost feels validated in one's quirks of judgment in the aftermath of war. </p> <p>One of the tortures of covering war in Bosnia was the necessity to surrender one's detachment and neutrality, supposed bedrocks of the journalist's trade - it was considered grossly unprofessional by some for me to testify at the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, for instance. But Herr is quick and unequivocal about the confluence between seeing and acting: 'You cannot be detached. If you are, you don't get it, however much you want to be a pure observer. If you are neutral, you don't understand it.' </p> <p>Another problem in Bosnia was the creeping realisation that the media are impotent in the face of political cynicism. A daily diet of concentration camps, rape camps, ethnic cleansing, bread-line massacres and water-queue massacres did nothing to affect the politicians' resolve to do nothing but bleat broken promises. Herr's war, however, was supposed to be the model for the kind of news reporting that moved public opinion into sabotage on the home front. But Herr takes a heretical, opposite view. </p> <p>'Television and news were always said to have ended the war. I thought the opposite. These images were always seen in another context - sandwiched in between commercials, so that they became a blancmange in the public mind. I think if anything, the blancmange coverage prolonged the war.' </p> <p>War correspondents like to hang out together, for obvious and estimable reasons. Ancient mariners are comfortable with each other, since there is no need to press the wedding guest to the wall and endure the exhaustion of telling the tale. But the mariner-correspondents divide between those who return to the 'theatre' for whatever reason and those who cannot face it. For what it's worth, I was always among the latter; I never went back to Bosnia, and thought this a failing. </p> <p>Herr tells a funny story out of the blue: 'I was always being asked to go to Vietnam and to functions and reunions. I never went. They invited me to the dedication of the Vietnam memorial in Washington DC, and I declined. I later went by myself and found it dynamic and very, very emotional - always someone there in sun or snow, day or dead of night, pointing out the name of an uncle to some kid. And once I did go to a reunion of war correspondents, a kind of uptown American Legion night. Terrific to see everyone; lovely evening. But you know? I was the only person who had never been back to Vietnam, and I never would go back to Vietnam. It wouldn't be a good thing for me. I still feel the elephant grass every time I hear a chopper, but please, not all that Robert McNamara stuff, crocodile tears and mea culpa in that creepy way. Or else Oh! What A Lovely War . What crap.' </p> <p>Herr liked and likes the Vets, even those who are 'not incredibly bad guys but who did incredibly bad things'. He followed, and is angered by, the treatment of the veterans upon their return - those kids of 19 from the prairies and ghettos of America sent to a place where they expected to find a McDonald's and instead found insanity. Those who then returned when they were 21, despised by the liberals for having gone and by the establishment for having lost. </p> <p>'There were more suicides among the vets,' says Herr, 'than were killed in the war. They were off the chart. There was no welcome back from their own people and they were spat at by the hippies. There was no recognition of what had happened to these guys.' And yet he is merciless with those haunted veterans who still sit wearing sunglasses at the back of bars in the rust belt, at three in the morning, if they have not yet taken their own lives. 'You get what you deserve in the end. Those men who came back and beat up their wives, who can't clean it out,' muses Herr. 'They are in the hell realms they deserve to be in, where people are tortured maybe not by what they have done, but by the fact that they may have got some pleasure out of doing it.' </p> <p>Why, after all that, Michael Herr, are you not crazy? He stares out from the bench across the lawn over which the branches reach, laden with high summer, and answers with a naked honesty that is almost scary: 'I did go crazy. The problem with Vietnam is that if your body came back, your mind came back too. Within 18 months of coming back, I was on the edge of a major breakdown. It hit in 1971 and it was very serious. Real despair for three or four years; deep paralysis. I split up with my wife for a year. I didn't see anybody because I didn't want anybody to see me. It's part of the attachment. You get attached to good things; you get attached to bad things. Then I decided to look the other way. Suddenly I had a child. I went back to my book.' </p> <p>Most of Dispatches had been written over the 18-month period before Herr's depression. And when the book was published, he says: 'I was famous for a while. I was always ambitious and I always wanted to be famous. And now I was. I had money. The writers I admired were now friends of mine such as William Burroughs, Salman Rushdie, Philip Roth.' Out of the comfortless landscape of Dispatches , then, came happy years raising a family off the Old Brompton Road in London. Then, in 1978, Apocalypse Now , with Francis Ford Coppola. 'I loved doing that. I was uncertain about returning to the Vietnam thing, but it was a wonderful experience, and of course did more good for my vanity and ego. But after that, that was it. No more Vietnam.' </p> <p>Kubrick and Herr met in 1980, when the director was deliberating the idea of a film about the holocaust, and wanted Herr's view on Raul Hilberg's epic The Destruction of the European Jews . But Kubrick's real target was obvious. Not Dispatches - there was insufficient narrative - but Vietnam, certainly. 'He didn't want to make an anti-war film,' Herr says, 'he just wanted to depict war. He wanted to show what war is like.' </p> <p>'Doesn't that remind you of someone?' I ask. </p> <p>'Er, yeah. Suppose it does.' </p> <p>An ideal match, maybe, but it took Kubrick three years to persuade Herr to return to his 'hell realm' of 'Nam. 'I once described 1980-83 as a single phone call lasting three years, with interruptions,' writes Herr. 'I'd think DOESN'T THIS GUY GET TIRED?' The Vietnam book that both Kubrick and Herr settled on was the one which Herr himself places above all others, and which is now 'outrageously out of print' - The Short-Timers , by Gustav Hasford. Hasford was, by Herr's own description, 'a scary man, a big, haunted marine', whom Kubrick was determined to meet. 'I advised him against it,' recalls Herr. 'I told Stanley I didn't think they'd get on.' Kubrick insisted, Hasford duly came over to Britain and there was a dinner during which Kubrick passed Herr a note saying: 'I can't deal with this man.' From then on, Hasford was dismissed from the maestro's presence. The movie, however, went ahead, famously bearing all the hallmarks of Kubrick's genius and Herr's inimitable insight into the vicious humour and the relentlessness of war. It is not, however, Herr's favourite Kubrick film, a pride of place he reserves for Barry Lyndon . </p> <p>Herr's book is too restrained to admit it, but Kubrick clearly adored his American friend. He protested wildly when Herr elected to return to America. But they kept in close contact and from their collaboration came this book, which is a welcome retort to the absurdity from Frederic Raphael about Stanley Kubrick the 'self-hating Jew' ( Eyes Wide Open , published last year). </p> <p>There is an intriguing point about Kubrick's 'ear' rather than his endlessly analysed 'eye' - about Kubrick's sensibility towards language. 'The basis of our friendship was verbal, not visual,' Herr recalls in conversation. 'Kubrick was drawn to language, he loved language. It was not the message of A Clockwork Orange that lured him, it was the language in the book. His method was to capture the visual equivalent to language.' </p> <p>Then there is a point about Kubrick and music. Everyone knows that Kubrick used music like no other director outside the old USSR. Herr develops the theme in his book, but sadly omits a story about how in 1984, during the making of Full Metal Jacket , Kubrick asked him: 'Did you ever hear the Rolling Stones?' Kubrick clearly had not, even though Mick Jagger invited himself to dinner chez Kubrick after seeing Clockwork Orange . Kubrick's explanation was that he had been 'too immersed in Beethoven and the Strausses while making Orange and 2001 to notice rock and roll'. As everyone knows, 'Paint It Black' makes it big into Full Metal Jacket . Being famous, says Herr, 'was wonderful. Then it was not so wonderful'. Why? 'Suddenly enough was enough.' </p> <p>Paint it black. It's funny talking to Herr. That unnerving certainty. That quiet core. I find myself talking about things I really shouldn't. About how I, for what it's worth, still have the nightmares; and about how sometimes when the phone rings, I smash it. 'Hmm,' he says, 'sure gets worse 'fore it gets better.' Have to replace the phone a lot. Smash crockery. Shout at people I shouldn't shout at. Can't sleep. Michael Herr doesn't do that kind of thing any more; he demobilised to some other zone. How? </p> <p>It was while he was 'famous' that Herr decided to 'look the other way' once again. This time towards Tibetan Buddhism. His commitment is absolute. He meditates; he thinks; he is immersed. He gets up at six in the morning, but is unavailable to anyone until 10.30. 'I am not qualified to talk about this,' he insists, infuriatingly. 'I am not a Lama, I am a novice. But I know this: that whatever you are dealing with is real all right, but what you do with it is in your mind. That is the upside to the attachment, to not being detached. You take responsibility in your own mind, and that is how I cleaned it all out. It all happens in your own mind.' And he pulls the peak of his baseball cap down over his forehead. </p> <p>\u0095 Kubrick by Michael Herr is published by Macmillan at \u00a310.</p>",

He gets up at six in the morning, but is unavailable to anyone until 10.30. 'I am not qualified to talk about this,' he insists, infuriatingly. 'I am not a Lama, I am a novice. But I know this: that whatever you are dealing with is real all right, but what you do with it is in your mind. That is the upside to the attachment, to not being detached. You take responsibility in your own mind, and that is how I cleaned it all out. It all happens in your own mind.' And he pulls the peak of his baseball cap down over his forehead. \u0095 Kubrick by Michael Herr is published by Macmillan at \u00a310.",

      "body": "<p><strong>John Papsidera (casting director):</strong> There were two distinct moments that I remember when I sat in a crowded cinema that was just buzzing with anticipation. One was The Full Monty and the other was Basic Instinct (pictured), which Paul Verhoeven did before Showgirls. And it felt like the audience was there because they thought, 'Oooh, isn't this taboo?' It was as if somebody suddenly said, 'It's OK for you to go see nudity in a film.'</p> <p><strong>Michael Cristofer (director and screenwriter - Gia):</strong> In Basic Instinct, the nudity helped tell us who that character was - a woman who used her sexuality to manipulate. If it had not been that interesting a character and a story, Sharon Stone could have walked around naked for an hour and 48 minutes and it would not have made her a star. </p> <p><strong>Guinevere Turner (co-screenwriter and actress - American Psycho):</strong> People want to see R-rated movies, adults and children alike, and an easy way to get an R-rating is to have sex scenes or nudity. We'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't think teenagers wanted to see sex. And in creating the taboo, we create frenzy around it. </p> <p><strong>Marc Norman (co-screenwriter - Shakespeare in Love):</strong> When I think of Showgirls and Basic Instinct, the distinction is in the excellence of the film. Showgirls was a turkey, and the nudity meant nothing to the box office. Basic Instinct was a cracking good story and, on top of that, everybody heard you could see Sharon Stone's ya-ya.</p> <p> In Shakespeare in Love, there's a tease when Shakespeare is unwrapping the binding over Gwyneth Paltrow's chest, and she's about to be naked, then later on you do see her breasts. We could have optically enlarged the shot so that her breasts were out of the frame. There was some discussion that without the nudity it would get a PG, so people could bring younger children, but it never came to a vote. We didn't feel it was worth second-guessing the creative decision for the marketing decision. And the film ended up making $100m in the US. </p> <p><strong>Papsidera:</strong> Look at what just happened with Jessica Biel. She was in Ulee's Gold, and she was fabulous, but, you know, very few people saw that film, and Seventh Heaven, her TV show, is so sweet and syrupy, she really passed under the radar for a lot of years. So she did the cover of Gear magazine semi-naked. It was an attention-getting moment, and it catapulted her career. </p> <p><strong>Glenn Rigberg (manager - Rigberg, Roberts &amp; Rugolo):</strong> What's so interesting is when you wander around the agencies and sets in Hollywood right now, there's this special magazine insert called the Maxim 100, which is pictures of scantily clad models and actresses. And I swear to God, it's being used in Hollywood to help cast movies. </p> <p><strong>Too much of a good thing? </strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Gill (president - Miramax Los Angeles):</strong> If you're writing Shakespeare in Love or Good Will Hunting, you are trying to reach an audience that is judgmental about emotional delivery and character development. With a Freddie Prinze Jr movie, even though the girls in the test audience scream when he takes his shirt off, you try not to have them be too sexy for a PG-13, because you won't get the eight- to 12-year-olds. By contrast, Miramax has a spoof of the Scream movies called Scary Movie coming out this summer. There's nudity in it that puts it right up against the edge of NC-17. And we need to be, because the whole point is to make a lot of fun of all of those ridiculous 'sexy girl in jeopardy' stereotypes. </p> <p><strong>Cristofer:</strong> Any studio with any brains knows that movies that come on strong with nudity, like Showgirls, are threatening to the young male audience - which is their primary target. It places a huge responsibility on their shoulders to know more about sex than they do. </p> <p><strong>Joan Chen (director and actress - Autumn in New York):</strong> With Autumn in New York, there was a scene where Winona Ryder was to appear naked. It would've been her first time. They must have thought it would be a draw, otherwise they wouldn't have asked her to sign this agreement. And she had some concerns, but she trusted that as I'm a female, I wouldn't exploit her and would make sure it was beautiful. The scene was shot through glass in more of an abstract than a real way. Still, at test screenings, people voluntarily wrote that they didn't want to see the nudity. </p> <p><strong>Men vs women</strong> </p> <p><strong>Turner:</strong> The female body always has been used for entertainment/abuse. I loved how in American Psycho Mary Harron put a lot of gratuitous shots of Christian Bale's body, these long, lingering shower scenes, completely shot the way women are done in movies. And there were scenes in which he's looking at himself in the mirror while having sex that had to be cut in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. I take personal offence with that, since I'm nude in a three-way with a hooker later in the movie and I get brutally murdered, and that was just fine with the censors. </p> <p><strong>Cristofer:</strong> It's part of the sexist nature of our business. We don't expect Al Pacino or Robert De Niro lying across a beach in a pair of Speedos with a cocktail in his hand trying to be seductive. But a great actress we do expect to lie out as naked as possible, and the only reason she should be in a movie is because we want to have sex with her. </p> <p><strong>Gill:</strong> There was a really fascinating exception to that recently, the Leelee Sobieski film Here on Earth, which was all about Chris Klein running around, bronzed, with his shirt off. It was the sort of parading that actresses are expected to do routinely. </p> <p><strong>Papsidera:</strong> That seems to be an emerging trend in teen films. In Varsity Blues, Scott Caan was naked except for a cowboy hat and boots, whereas one of the female stars, Ali Larter, wore a less-revealing bikini made out of whipped cream. </p> <p><strong>Cristofer:</strong> That's kind of refreshing, even if it means making male nudity humorous and humiliating. And then there are actors like Ewan McGregor - there's hardly a movie where he doesn't show everything. </p> <p><strong>When to get naked (or not) </strong></p> <p><strong>Rigberg:</strong> In representing actresses, you always have to ask, 'Will you do nudity or are you totally against it?' and the answer always seems to be, 'Well, in the right circumstance,' and then I'll name a circumstance, and they'll say, 'Well, no, but maybe for Martin Scorsese.' You also need to discuss the difference between sexual conduct and nudity, because some actresses won't do a sex scene, but they'll be topless. Even so, when the director who you've been worshipping during the whole making of the movie says: 'I kind of want to do it like this. Do you mind?' it puts that performer, especially an unknown, on the spot. That's when you get the call - 'Do I have to? Do I have to?' </p> <p><strong>Bill Veloric (agent - Stone Manners Talent Agency):</strong> I've run into a number of things that were presented as the right situation and totally became the wrong situation. I just advised someone who wasn't willing to do anything other than upper-frontal nudity not to agree to nudity. Consequently, her part got whittled down, and one of the most valuable scenes in the movie was given to someone else. </p> <p><strong> Rigberg:</strong> On the other hand, nudity can put an actress back on the map. I represent Tatum O'Neal, and I recently sent her a script based on Linda Lovelace. But would the mother of a 14-year-old, a 12-year-old and a nine-year-old play this porn star where she would have to be nude in it? At first she called me up and said, 'Are you out of your mind?' And after, she read it and took it seriously and she said, 'Well, I could never let my kids see this, but I'm into it.' </p> <p><strong>Papsidera:</strong> There is the desire of actresses of a certain age, meaning over the age of 30, not to be perceived as the mother character. They want to be perceived as young and sexy. In the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, Rene Russo did a nude scene, and it was good for her in that regard.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When it comes to nudity, actresses are just like you and me - self-conscious, vain, insecure, eager to please and sometimes miserable. Except that when they take their clothes off, they have to do it in front of the people they work with, knowing that they have little if any control over how the images of their naked bodies - which will then be projected on to 30ft screens in front of millions of complete strangers - will ultimately be presented in the context of the finished project. And that their families will probably see them. And their friends. And that owing to the miracle of video rental, the internet and enormous media interest, these images will be preserved, if not for ever, at least for long enough that whatever the actresses' original thoughts about getting naked were, they'll probably have second, third and fourth thoughts about it. </p> <p>On the other hand, being a hot body can be extremely lucrative, and even career-making. It is increasingly a job requisite with, for example, actresses in their late teens and early twenties, like those in American Beauty (pictured), appearing topless as a matter of course, a circumstance that would have caused at least a mild stir 20 years ago. Nevertheless, other than a pro-forma disclaimer that the script called for it or a rare, and usually roundly mocked, claim of pride in nudity (think Demi Moore) or exploitation (think about the raised-eyebrow doubts that greeted Sharon Stone's contention that she was tricked into showing more than she knew in Basic Instinct), the women themselves rarely get a chance to say how they feel about this state of affairs. No one wants to look like a braggart or a whiner and, anyway, it's embarrassing to talk about.</p> <p>Rosie P\u00e9rez, whose first film role - in Do the Right Thing - had such a memorable nude scene that a decade later she's still living it down (or up), convened a round table of some of her friends and colleagues, inviting a reporter to participate, to talk about the pressures, rewards and plain facts about getting naked in public.</p> <p><strong>Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump, Fearless):</strong> I initially wanted to do this round table because of my stepdaughter, because she told me that there was a website where I was nude. And it just brought up a lot of questions, because now that I'm older and married and I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter, and she sees me naked on a website, I'm like: how am I going to respond to her? Am I going to say, 'Oh that's a horrible thing?'</p> <p>I really had to think, 'Wait a minute, do I really feel good about what I did? Do I feel embarrassed in front of her because I did those things?' And then I started reaching even further, and I remember there was a point in my career where I actually pulled back, because everybody wanted me to do these movies where I'm taking off my clothes and sassafrassing around, and then I found myself covering up, and I was like, 'Well, that's not me, either.' It's just that the whole entertainment industry forces you to deal with the issue of sexuality, and of your own sexuality.</p> <p>I see explicit covers on magazines, and they're getting even more explicit, and it's like, 'Are women being empowered, or is this just what sells magazines?' Are they feeling pressured, or have they really come into themselves and are saying, 'I am woman, hear me roar?'</p> <p><strong>Mim Udovitch:</strong> Maybe we should start by going around the room and talking about your first, or your most memorable, experiences while doing nude scenes. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> My first experience, of course, was Do the Right Thing. And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think - that's what was really bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I don't want to do this. I felt like Irene Cara in Fame. It was like, 'Wait a minute, I feel so wimpy, this is not who I am.' So that was my first experience, and it was horrible.</p> <p>But then I went and took my clothes off again for White Men Can't Jump! But that was because it was totally my decision, I felt totally comfortable, the director was so cool and Woody Harrelson was like, 'Well, whatever you want is cool with me.' So there I felt empowered by it. But with Do the Right Thing it was like, 'Now I'm the object, here's the shot.' And the reason why I cried was not so much because I felt violated as because I was angry at myself, because I wanted to say: 'Say something! Get up!' So that's how I felt violated. I felt like I violated myself. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex and the City, State and Main):</strong> Well, I've never done nudity. And I don't do nudity, and for no particular moral reason. It's not a judgment, and I'm very admiring of those people who feel comfortable enough to do it. The irony is that I come from a very politically progressive family. But I've just never felt comfortable, and I've always felt that I could convince whoever had an idea that nudity might be good in a scene that it wasn't. I was thinking of all these stories - not that a lot of people try to get me to take my clothes off - but in a work environment, when it's been discussed, there are some stories that are really awful, and in retrospect I felt that it was good old-fashioned Hollywood sexual harassment, where I didn't realise that was what was happening.</p> <p>Generally speaking, you're the only woman around, there's just men everywhere you look. I remember one experience in particular. They thought that I was going to do a nude scene the next day and they started joking about it the night before, saying, 'Oh, tomorrow Sarah Jessica's getting nude,' and it was very late at night, and everybody was laughing, and I said, 'No, I'm not,' and they said, 'Yes, you are.' And then there were phone calls made to my agent, and mean things were said. You know: 'We shouldn't have hired her. We should have hired so and so.' And I kept thinking, 'Oh, please God, fire me.' I mean the movie was bad anyway. It was a really awful situation. So I didn't do it, but the fellow playing opposite me did - he was totally nude in the scene, and it was just as awful as it gets. I thought, 'Well, that's his only means of making me feel uncomfortable now, for him to be nude because he knows that for me this is awkward.' </p> <p><strong>Udovitch: </strong> So your contracts specify no nude scenes? </p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Yes. And now that I'm married, not that there's any kind of dictatorship in the house, but he doesn't even really like to see a photograph that is meant to be titillating or whatever, it makes him feel uncomfortable. And I think I'm much more conscious of that, too, now - like what I do at work, too, even a scene with a bra and skirt. </p> <p><strong>Sandra Bernhard (The King of Comedy, I'm Still Here Damn It):</strong> For me, any time I've used nudity in my work, I've always felt strangely detached from it, and it's always been on a lot of different levels that it's worked for me, and had sort of a multipurpose emotional and cultural reference. So I've never felt in any way, shape or form exploited or used, because it's always been pretty much my decision. Even in King of Comedy, where I stripped down for Jerry Lewis, it's such a perfect metaphor for any woman's darkest fantasy. It's always been, I don't know, kind of a kick for me - having grown up being really skinny and, like, not particularly confident, for me it has always felt really liberating. </p> <p><strong>Perez: </strong> That's how I felt for White Men Can't Jump. </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> But you're a little bit more bodacious than I am, so I'm sure your whole life you've kind of been looked at in a much more sexual way, and ogled. Also, when you do comedy, you're usually alone onstage, so you're calling the shots. And if you're not self-deprecating, you just don't get into that whole sort of I'm-being-completely-exploited-by-the-patriarchy thing. And in terms of my own daughter, we kind of always wander around naked together, so it's pretty open and relaxed. I think it's something I missed growing up. That's not my mother's thing, she's not sexual, so for me it was kind of like a new experience to be sexual and express it through my work. Because in my own life I'm sometimes completely detached from it as well. </p> <p><strong>Sarita Choudhury (Mississippi Masala, Kama Sutra):</strong> My first time nude was with a woman director, so I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't. I got my period just before. </p> <p><strong>Debi Mazar (GoodFellas, The Insider):</strong> Me, too! </p> <p><strong>Choudhury:</strong> Really? And so I didn't want to come down from the room - it was horrific. Usually, though, I feel really comfortable during the scene, and then I hate it when the movie is going to come out. My family is conservative, and that is hard. I don't know why it's so liberating when I'm doing it and then I guess it just shows, and it's weird, that an experience can be normal, but when you think about it in the context of family and tradition, then it's not. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> It's funny. With family, I don't know what to say any more. My father calls and he says: 'Hello, baby! Do I see this one?' 'No.' 'OK, bye!' </p> <p><strong>Amber Valletta (What Lies Beneath, Drop Back Ten):</strong> Well, none of the films I've done were nude. But one of the first modelling jobs I got that was big, that was a break, I got for French Elle - and in France nudity is not a big deal. I went on the job because one of the two models got sick, and the other one was Claudia Schiffer. Obviously I was kind of the nobody, so she got all the work - it was a week in the Seychelles, and they were like, 'Well, we'll shoot a couple of covers on you when we get a chance.' I was 17, maybe 18, and they asked me to take off my top for one of these pictures. And the picture is of me like this [crosses arms over breasts and freezes] and I look so uncomfortable. I had never taken off my clothes for a photographer before, and he was particularly mean, he was very macho, and it didn't make it any easier. And I kind of regret ever doing that for them, even though the photo never ran, because it was not something I felt good about. I think for one, I was too young, I wasn't even that sexual. Nor did it make any sense for the photo.</p> <p>Since then I have done a few nude pictures and I'm very, very careful about it - like I know the number of nude pictures that are out. But then there are runway photos that are on the internet. This one kid came up to me and said, 'Can you sign this?' And I looked, and it was a totally sheer top - you could see my breasts like it was broad daylight. And you just never think, because it's for a fashion show, that those pictures might get cut for </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> Celebrity Skin! </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> That was the website! </p> <p><strong>Valletta:</strong> Actually, I've seen it twice now, so now I am even careful on runways, but sometimes you just say, 'I don't care, I feel good.' But the first one was definitely uncomfortable. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> The difference maybe is you're in a position now where you can say no, and before, you really </p> <p><strong>Valletta:</strong> I couldn't. I was trying to do a job, and I was with a model who was already made, and she was going to do the picture if I wasn't, probably, and maybe not naked, but it would have been one more for her and one less for me. And when you're young and naive it's not that you're not given a choice, but you maybe don't know what your choices are. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> Everyone has said that power is an issue. Sandra has said she's the most comfortable, and she's the one who has the most power over what she does. And it's funny what Sarah Jessica said, about the male actor in the love scene, that male nudity expresses power the other way, you know, it imposes power. </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> For me, I basically had hippie parents, and I've always been a very sexual person and OK with people seeing my body - so my first experience being naked, I gave full nudity. I read it, I discussed it with the director, we discussed how we were going to shoot it - it was going to be very Bu\u00f1uel-like, starting with the tip of my heel - and we had it all mapped out, and I felt, Wow, this is going to be really cool. It was my first big studio lead. It was called Money for Nothing. It had John Cusack, Benicio Del Toro, all these great actors. And then, at the end of the day, it was completely gratuitous, like they just showed me sitting on him, frontal. It wasn't artistic, it wasn't beautiful, it wasn't even a good angle for me. And I just felt like, 'Damn, there's really nothing you can do about it, because you never know how they're going to cut it up.' Now, with love scenes, often if I read a script and I don't trust a director, I have a clause - no nudity.</p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> That's something that's really bizarre, when you get to that point in the Hollywood system where you have to negotiate certain body parts. </p> <p><strong>Choudhury:</strong> Oh, completely! It's absurd! </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> It's like, No below nipple, no crotch shot, only side, no frontal, or in the frontal, only stomach </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> And no crack. Mm-hmm. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> Right, no crack. They literally have these terms, and you sit there thinking, What the hell is going on? It drives me crazy to the point where I want to say, 'No, you can't show nothing,' not because I don't believe in it, but because it's so absurd. </p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> It's worth noting that we feel we need protection with this, whereas everything else that we're told as women of a certain generation is, 'We are as good, we're equal, we can have the whole thing,' and we still feel we need somebody, a manager or an agent or a big, burly somebody, to say no. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> But then some women who have chosen to take their clothes off - and examples that spring to mind are Demi Moore, Madonna, Elizabeth Berkley, obviously a big range of performers doing very different kinds of work - but they were all clobbered, in a way that it's hard to believe anybody deserves for anything they do in entertainment. </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> Did it hurt them? No. </p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I think it hurt Elizabeth Berkley. </p> <p><strong>Choudhury:</strong> I think it hurt Demi Moore. I think it hurt her big time. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> I think it hurt Madonna in the short term, also. </p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Perhaps it's not fair to prognosticate about Elizabeth Berkley, but it's an easy example, in a way. I looked at Showgirls, and although I don't know what she was thinking, what it felt like in the audience, she wanted to be in a big movie, and it wasn't good, the script wasn't good. But look how different Gina Gershon was - she seemed very self-aware and ironic. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> I think Elizabeth Berkley was different in that she was very young, and she just did what the director told her and, as it happened, it didn't work. </p> <p><strong>Perez [to Bernhard]:</strong> What's the matter? Do you not agree, lady? </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> Nothing's the matter. I have nothing to say about Showgirls. I just think it's a campy, funny film, and I think anybody in that role would have probably been in the same position. It was an asinine role, the film was completely absurd and, I mean, it didn't even capture Vegas. But it was brilliant, it was hysterical, it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen! There's no way you can take that movie seriously. </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> I went in to audition on that movie. I knew it wasn't good when I read it, and I thought, 'Man, I'll go in, and I'll work it, I'll use my sexuality because I can.' </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> Did you go in for Gina's role? </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> Yeah. And when I walk into an audition, I do use my sexuality to get a part, to put it out there, to convince them. </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> If you're going in and using your sexuality to get a part, how can you ever get offended if they want you to be nude? </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> I don't. But I decide when I get exploited now. </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> That's fair. </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> I figure I've done enough movies now that I know angles, I know lighting, I know </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> It's all about looking beautiful for you, I think. </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> No! I look ugly in a lot of movies. I play a lot of charactery parts. </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> I know, I'm just kidding. But if you're gonna expose yourself in that way, you want to be pretty - everybody does. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> I want to be in shape. </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> But there's some point of vanity. To me, the most offensive scene in any movie, nudity-wise, was Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct. It was like, I can't believe I have to look at this creepy old guy. I mean, that was a broke-down moment. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> I think one of the best examples of nudity I've seen women do in movies is Blue Velvet, when home-chick came out on the lawn and she's naked. That was where I thought nudity was so appropriate, because this man tormented her and drove her to the point of insanity, so when she walked out on the lawn, you weren't saying to yourself, 'Oh, my God, Isabella Rossellini's naked,' you were saying, 'Oh, my God, she's finally flipped out.' You're so concentrated on her character. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> Another thing about Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet is that she looked great when she came out naked, even completely tormented, but what she also looked like was like an un-worked-out body, and at that time, in 1986, you never saw that. In the 80s, after Madonna got worked out, all the standards changed. Because if you see 60s beach movies, those girls are pretty, but they have thighs, their stomachs aren't flat and you never see that any more. </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> Or if you see any of Russ Meyer's films. </p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> It's funny because I always think how beautiful Isabella Rossellini is, and another person I always think of who is that beautiful is her mother. And her mother was like, a Woman. It's like, 'Oh, maybe some day I'll be a woman.' She's just like flesh, and sexy! </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> You better start eating, honey. You got a long way to go. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> Did anyone see Kate Winslet in Holy Smoke? She has a normal body, and she's beautiful. </p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I love her. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> But talking about Madonna, the sculptured body, nudity and sexuality, I feel so much pressure to stay small. And as you get older, it gets a little bit harder, and I love to eat. And when you go to Los Angeles, when you go on interviews and auditions, the first thing that they look at is your chest and your hips - they want to see how good your body is. </p> <p><strong>Mazar:</strong> I got prosthetic breasts, I got three sets. I got the chicken cutlets for the normal size - these are all for mastectomy patients - and then I got the next size, and then I got the nursing size, and I use them to create different shapes of body depending on the character, because sometimes I'll just figure out a way not to take my top off if I get the movie. But to get it, sometimes I walk in with these huge prosthetic breasts and big sweaters, because you know, you get a whole other body language. </p> <p><strong>Choudhury:</strong> I liked Rosie's ice-cube scene in Do the Right Thing. </p> <p><strong>Bernhard:</strong> But she was saying just before you got here that it made her cry when she was doing it. </p> <p><strong>Choudhury:</strong> But I liked your body, because I have breasts, so I was like, Oh, yeah. I was just comforted because there weren't many girls with that build. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> No, there weren't. First of all, back then there weren't many Puerto Rican girls in a lead role. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> And now there are so many. </p> <p><strong>Perez:</strong> Yeah, right - there's two more! Since 1989! </p> <p><strong>Choudhury:</strong> And the thing is, everybody says about Kate Winslet how they love her body, but the truth is, out in the world, no one really does. I mean, everyone does, but no one wants to hire that body. It's like everyone says they love my body, but then I'm supposed to lose weight. </p> <p><strong>Udovitch:</strong> I'm curious - does anyone disdain people who choose to augment their bodies? </p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> It doesn't bother me. Also, you don't like to rule anything out. I mean, I'd like to think I wouldn't do that, but who's to say? It's different for women, we have this window, certainly more in the movie business than in the theatre, and even in television it's probably a little better than in the movies. I feel like I have this window in the film industry, and it closes a little bit every day, and I'm now one of these people who talk about all these young people - Who are they? Where are they coming from? - and they're all on the magazines. I have no illusions about what I look like or what I don't look like. Until nine or 10 years ago, I didn't even have a role where men were interested, I was always like the cerebral best friend of the pretty girl. But that was all right, because I thought, 'Well, I'll work, because there will always be work for actors.' But for women, there's this window. So when I think about plastic surgery, I think, 'Well maybe it keeps the window open a little longer.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "When it comes to nudity, actresses are just like you and me - self-conscious, vain, insecure, eager to please and sometimes miserable. Except that when they take their clothes off, they have to do it in front of the people they work with, knowing that they have little if any control over how the images of their naked bodies - which will then be projected on to 30ft screens in front of millions of complete strangers - will ultimately be presented in the context of the finished project. And that their families will probably see them. And their friends. And that owing to the miracle of video rental, the internet and enormous media interest, these images will be preserved, if not for ever, at least for long enough that whatever the actresses' original thoughts about getting naked were, they'll probably have second, third and fourth thoughts about it. On the other hand, being a hot body can be extremely lucrative, and even career-making. It is increasingly a job requisite with, for example, actresses in their late teens and early twenties, like those in American Beauty (pictured), appearing topless as a matter of course, a circumstance that would have caused at least a mild stir 20 years ago.

But one of the first modelling jobs I got that was big, that was a break, I got for French Elle - and in France nudity is not a big deal. I went on the job because one of the two models got sick, and the other one was Claudia Schiffer. Obviously I was kind of the nobody, so she got all the work - it was a week in the Seychelles, and they were like, 'Well, we'll shoot a couple of covers on you when we get a chance.' I was 17, maybe 18, and they asked me to take off my top for one of these pictures. And the picture is of me like this [crosses arms over breasts and freezes] and I look so uncomfortable. I had never taken off my clothes for a photographer before, and he was particularly mean, he was very macho, and it didn't make it any easier. And I kind of regret ever doing that for them, even though the photo never ran, because it was not something I felt good about. I think for one, I was too young, I wasn't even that sexual. Nor did it make any sense for the photo. Since then I have done a few nude pictures and I'm very, very careful about it - like I know the number of nude pictures that are out. But then there are runway photos that are on the internet. This one kid came up to me and said, 'Can you sign this?' And I looked, and it was a totally sheer top - you could see my breasts like it was broad daylight. And you just never think, because it's for a fashion show, that those pictures might get cut for Mazar: Celebrity Skin! Perez: That was the website! Valletta: Actually, I've seen it twice now, so now I am even careful on runways, but sometimes you just say, 'I don't care, I feel good.' But the first one was definitely uncomfortable. Udovitch: The difference maybe is you're in a position now where you can say no, and before, you really Valletta: I couldn't. I was trying to do a job, and I was with a model who was already made, and she was going to do the picture if I wasn't, probably, and maybe not naked, but it would have been one more for her and one less for me. And when you're young and naive it's not that you're not given a choice, but you maybe don't know what your choices are. Udovitch: Everyone has said that power is an issue. Sandra has said she's the most comfortable, and she's the one who has the most power over what she does. And it's funny what Sarah Jessica said, about the male actor in the love scene, that male nudity expresses power the other way, you know, it imposes power. Mazar: For me, I basically had hippie parents, and I've always been a very sexual person and OK with people seeing my body - so my first experience being naked, I gave full nudity. I read it, I discussed it with the director, we discussed how we were going to shoot it - it was going to be very Bu\u00f1uel-like, starting with the tip of my heel - and we had it all mapped out, and I felt, Wow, this is going to be really cool. It was my first big studio lead. It was called Money for Nothing. It had John Cusack, Benicio Del Toro, all these great actors. And then, at the end of the day, it was completely gratuitous, like they just showed me sitting on him, frontal. It wasn't artistic, it wasn't beautiful, it wasn't even a good angle for me. And I just felt like, 'Damn, there's really nothing you can do about it, because you never know how they're going to cut it up.' Now, with love scenes, often if I read a script and I don't trust a director, I have a clause - no nudity. Perez: That's something that's really bizarre, when you get to that point in the Hollywood system where you have to negotiate certain body parts. Choudhury: Oh, completely! It's absurd! Perez: It's like, No below nipple, no crotch shot, only side, no frontal, or in the frontal, only stomach Mazar: And no crack. Mm-hmm. Perez: Right, no crack. They literally have these terms, and you sit there thinking, What the hell is going on? It drives me crazy to the point where I want to say, 'No, you can't show nothing,' not because I don't believe in it, but because it's so absurd. Parker: It's worth noting that we feel we need protection with this, whereas everything else that we're told as women of a certain generation is, 'We are as good, we're equal, we can have the whole thing,' and we still feel we need somebody, a manager or an agent or a big, burly somebody, to say no. Udovitch: But then some women who have chosen to take their clothes off - and examples that spring to mind are Demi Moore, Madonna, Elizabeth Berkley, obviously a big range of performers doing very different kinds of work - but they were all clobbered, in a way that it's hard to believe anybody deserves for anything they do in entertainment. Mazar: Did it hurt them? No. Parker: I think it hurt Elizabeth Berkley. Choudhury: I think it hurt Demi Moore. I think it hurt her big time. Udovitch: I think it hurt Madonna in the short term, also. Parker: Perhaps it's not fair to prognosticate about Elizabeth Berkley, but it's an easy example, in a way. I looked at Showgirls, and although I don't know what she was thinking, what it felt like in the audience, she wanted to be in a big movie, and it wasn't good, the script wasn't good. But look how different Gina Gershon was - she seemed very self-aware and ironic. Udovitch: I think Elizabeth Berkley was different in that she was very young, and she just did what the director told her and, as it happened, it didn't work. Perez [to Bernhard]: What's the matter? Do you not agree, lady? Bernhard: Nothing's the matter. I have nothing to say about Showgirls. I just think it's a campy, funny film, and I think anybody in that role would have probably been in the same position. It was an asinine role, the film was completely absurd and, I mean, it didn't even capture Vegas. But it was brilliant, it was hysterical, it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen! There's no way you can take that movie seriously. Mazar: I went in to audition on that movie. I knew it wasn't good when I read it, and I thought, 'Man, I'll go in, and I'll work it, I'll use my sexuality because I can.' Bernhard: Did you go in for Gina's role? Mazar: Yeah. And when I walk into an audition, I do use my sexuality to get a part, to put it out there, to convince them. Bernhard: If you're going in and using your sexuality to get a part, how can you ever get offended if they want you to be nude? Mazar: I don't. But I decide when I get exploited now. Bernhard: That's fair. Mazar: I figure I've done enough movies now that I know angles, I know lighting, I know Bernhard: It's all about looking beautiful for you, I think. Mazar: No! I look ugly in a lot of movies. I play a lot of charactery parts. Bernhard: I know, I'm just kidding. But if you're gonna expose yourself in that way, you want to be pretty - everybody does. Perez: I want to be in shape. Bernhard: But there's some point of vanity. To me, the most offensive scene in any movie, nudity-wise, was Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct. It was like, I can't believe I have to look at this creepy old guy. I mean, that was a broke-down moment. Perez: I think one of the best examples of nudity I've seen women do in movies is Blue Velvet, when home-chick came out on the lawn and she's naked. That was where I thought nudity was so appropriate, because this man tormented her and drove her to the point of insanity, so when she walked out on the lawn, you weren't saying to yourself, 'Oh, my God, Isabella Rossellini's naked,' you were saying, 'Oh, my God, she's finally flipped out.' You're so concentrated on her character. Udovitch: Another thing about Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet is that she looked great when she came out naked, even completely tormented, but what she also looked like was like an un-worked-out body, and at that time, in 1986, you never saw that. In the 80s, after Madonna got worked out, all the standards changed. Because if you see 60s beach movies, those girls are pretty, but they have thighs, their stomachs aren't flat and you never see that any more. Bernhard: Or if you see any of Russ Meyer's films. Parker: It's funny because I always think how beautiful Isabella Rossellini is, and another person I always think of who is that beautiful is her mother. And her mother was like, a Woman. It's like, 'Oh, maybe some day I'll be a woman.' She's just like flesh, and sexy! Bernhard: You better start eating, honey. You got a long way to go. Udovitch: Did anyone see Kate Winslet in Holy Smoke? She has a normal body, and she's beautiful. Parker: I love her. Perez: But talking about Madonna, the sculptured body, nudity and sexuality, I feel so much pressure to stay small. And as you get older, it gets a little bit harder, and I love to eat. And when you go to Los Angeles, when you go on interviews and auditions, the first thing that they look at is your chest and your hips - they want to see how good your body is. Mazar: I got prosthetic breasts, I got three sets. I got the chicken cutlets for the normal size - these are all for mastectomy patients - and then I got the next size, and then I got the nursing size, and I use them to create different shapes of body depending on the character, because sometimes I'll just figure out a way not to take my top off if I get the movie. But to get it, sometimes I walk in with these huge prosthetic breasts and big sweaters, because you know, you get a whole other body language. Choudhury: I liked Rosie's ice-cube scene in Do the Right Thing. Bernhard: But she was saying just before you got here that it made her cry when she was doing it. Choudhury: But I liked your body, because I have breasts, so I was like, Oh, yeah. I was just comforted because there weren't many girls with that build. Perez: No, there weren't. First of all, back then there weren't many Puerto Rican girls in a lead role. Udovitch: And now there are so many. Perez: Yeah, right - there's two more! Since 1989! Choudhury: And the thing is, everybody says about Kate Winslet how they love her body, but the truth is, out in the world, no one really does. I mean, everyone does, but no one wants to hire that body. It's like everyone says they love my body, but then I'm supposed to lose weight. Udovitch: I'm curious - does anyone disdain people who choose to augment their bodies? Parker: It doesn't bother me. Also, you don't like to rule anything out. I mean, I'd like to think I wouldn't do that, but who's to say? It's different for women, we have this window, certainly more in the movie business than in the theatre, and even in television it's probably a little better than in the movies. I feel like I have this window in the film industry, and it closes a little bit every day, and I'm now one of these people who talk about all these young people - Who are they? Where are they coming from? - and they're all on the magazines. I have no illusions about what I look like or what I don't look like. Until nine or 10 years ago, I didn't even have a role where men were interested, I was always like the cerebral best friend of the pretty girl. But that was all right, because I thought, 'Well, I'll work, because there will always be work for actors.' But for women, there's this window. So when I think about plastic surgery, I think, 'Well maybe it keeps the window open a little longer.'",

      "body": "<p>Hollywood's greatest war heroes, from John Wayne to Sylvester Stallone, have been men who have elaborately avoided the world's real battlefields. So it is fitting that Mel Gibson, now the definitive cinematic nationalist, is a man of no great patriotism. When he starred in Braveheart, everyone knew he was not Scottish. Since Gibson is commonly believed to be Australian, his new American Revolution epic, The Patriot, would seem to be equally improbable. </p> <p>As it happens, Mel Gibson was born in New York state and holds a US passport. But his wife and children are Australian, he has homes in both countries and a cynical approach to politics that undercuts the thunderous flag-waving message of a film that was released over the Fourth of July holiday in the States. </p> <p> The Patriot has been hugely controversial: criticised for demonising the British Army, for white-washing the slave states and for indirectly contributing to Holocaust denial. A big, simplistic film, it shows the British burning down a church filled with people, while the all the black characters in the movie - set in slave-owning South Carolina - are free, well-fed, happy and grateful to the Mel Gibson character. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, but with some justification, Spike Lee has accused the film of racism. The US Ambassador to Britain, Philip Lader, joined the debate yesterday by refusing to defend the film and admitting 'the perpetuation of myths and the exaggeration of stories does not serve our countries well'. And the Lord Mayor of Liverpool has sprung to the defence of the historical model of the film's prisoner-murdering Colonel Tavington, placing a portrait of Banastre Tarleton in his office. The most extreme criticism has come from the New York Post's Jonathan Foreman, who argues that by suggesting that all armies commit gross atrocities, it makes the crimes of the Nazis seem par for the course. </p> <p>All this is the kind of fuss that Gibson enjoys: he made Braveheart and the massively violent Payback anticipating that they would cause trouble. He won't, however, let his children see these films. He has some fervent beliefs, amongst them that John and Robert Kennedy were killed because they wanted the US out of Vietnam. But above all, there is his unshakable Catholicism: Gibson is opposed to birth control, abortion, divorce and the theory of evolution. In a business where marriages often last months, Gibson - married since 1980, seven children - has made himself a standard bearer of family values. By Hollywood standards he has a tiny entourage: he or his wife normally pick up the kids from school. </p> <p>'There's nothing more important than your family,' he said recently. 'If you ruin that part of your life, what's left? Work? Money? Screwing around? I see a lot of people living like that who tell themselves they're having a good time but if you look under the surface you see lots of corpses masquerading as human beings.' </p> <p>Not that Gibson has always been a model citizen. In the mid-Eighties he was drinking five beers before breakfast, and - like his cinematic heir, Russell Crowe - never shied away from a punch-up in a bar. There were often girls with him in those bars, although it was never proved that he broke the sacred marriage vows. He was arrested for drunk driving in 1984. In either 1986 or 1991 - depending on which story you believe - he managed to stop drinking completely. Smoking is another matter: he seems constantly on the verge of giving up. </p> <p>Gibson is a sex symbol whose backside has famously been exposed in a number of films, but says he does not like sex scenes. 'It's uncomfortable, especially with cameras watching you.' When interviewed, he is either entertainingly flip or grumpy, but either way manages to keep his private life guarded. We know, however, that he likes to engage in traditionally 'manly' endeavours, like hunting and farming. 'There's a lot of anger and hostility under Mel's surface,' according to Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner. And as he has curbed his youthful rebelliousness, the example of his father - 'a very capable man' according to his son - looms larger. </p> <p>Hutton Gibson, now 82, is the son of an Australian opera singer who moved to the US. He worked as a railway brakeman until an injury forced him to retire early, with a generous compensation package. Though he disapproved of television, he had a successful run as a quiz show contestant, picking up $21,000 on Jeopardy. In 1968, he moved his family - eventually 11 children, including one adopted - to Australia. He formed a group called the Alliance For Catholic Tradition, and has several polemics in print decrying the influence of Vatican II, including 'Is The Pope A Catholic?' and 'The Enemy Is Here'. He has described the burning of heretics as 'an act of charity', and contends that even the current Pope is disturbingly liberal. </p> <p>At the time of the move to Australia, Mel, the sixth child, was 12. He went to an all-boys school but admits that he wasn't much of a student. He was considering becoming a journalist or a chef when his sister Mary sent in an application on his behalf to the National Institute of Dramatic Arts at University Of South Wales. He did not make it to graduation - 'an honourable discharge', he says - but it didn't matter. It had never been a better time to be an actor in Australia: led by directors Peter Weir and Phillip Noyce, the film industry had come alive. After appearing as a surfer in a movie called Summer City (1977), Gibson auditioned for a role in first time director George Miller's Mad Max (1979). His face had just been smashed up in a bar brawl, which probably helped him get the title role as a cop seeking revenge in a post-apocalyptic world. </p> <p>The film made Gibson an instant star, and it turned into international stardom after the sequel - The Road Warrior - and Peter Weir's Gallipoli (both 1981). In 1980, he married Robyn Moore, a dental nurse. Little seen in public, she is widely considered to be the tougher half of the couple, and the one who held the family together as Gibson's drinking worsened following his arrival in Hollywood in the early Eighties. After Mad Max Beyond The Thunderdome (1985), Gibson dropped out of the business for two years, spending the time on his 800-acre Australian cattle ranch. </p> <p>He returned as Riggs, the suicidal cop in Lethal Weapon (1987), which turned out to be the starting point of a series even more profitable than Mad Max. The first Lethal Weapon had the qualities that Gibson says he looks for in a film. 'I want the nightmare. I need that conflict, the edginess that makes you want to know what happens next.' What Gibson has certainly proved is that he has no fear of ridicule, surprising everyone by playing a macho but decently received Hamlet in Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 film. </p> <p>In the Nineties he also started directing, with 1993's modest drama The Man Without A Face leading to the bombastic Braveheart (1995). 'I know I'm gonna get crucified,' he said before the release of his spectacularly bloody William Wallace biopic, but instead he was rewarded with both massive box office and Oscars for best director and best picture. Like many successful actors, he started up a production company, Icon. But whereas most actor's companies remain small-scale, Icon - Gibson is chairman - has grown, buying up other companies, setting up its own London-based European distribution arm and making films as far from Gibson's own territory as Kevin and Perry Go Large. It has also carried out the more traditional role of providing a home for Gibson's vanity projects, notably the badly received, Wim Wenders directed, Million Dollar Hotel, from an idea by Bono with Gibson as a mutant FBI agent. One of the film's stars, Peter Stormare, says of Gibson: 'That's the way you should do it. Take a garbage role for the money, like Lethal Weapon 4, and then do what you want to do. He's a cool fella.' </p> <p>Although The Patriot has underperformed at the US box office, making Gibson's alleged record-setting $25 million fee look unwise, it is unlikely to damage him much. After all, he has had a double presence in the cinema this summer, also providing the voice of Rocky the Rooster in Chicken Run. And if things get rough again, he has his Australian ranch, his Connecticut mansion and his two houses in Malibu to retreat to. </p> <p>However, he has had trouble with the Connecticut house: the neighbours are not happy with the two donkeys and six sheep he has been keeping on his land in a residential area. But despite the occasional flop, Gibson's career has been a remarkably smooth affair, and at 44, he is just coming into his prime as a Hollywood leading man. These days, he is the prototype for good-looking but rough-hewn antipodean stars like Crowe and Heath Ledger, who plays his son in The Patriot. 'He is more like a guy than any guy I have ever met,' claims screenwriter Robert Towne. </p> <p>Perhaps Gibson's succinct account of his current state of mind explains why he has prospered. 'When I was younger, I was tortured. But then I decided it just wasn't worth spending my time on.' </p> <p><strong> Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> DoB:</strong> 3 January 1956 (Peekskill, New York) </p> <p> <strong> Married to:</strong> Robyn Hannah Moore (seven children - Hannah, Edward, Christian, William, Louis, Milo, Tommy) </p> <p> <strong> Trained:</strong> National Institute of Damatic Arts, Sydney </p> <p> <strong> First film:</strong> Summer City (AKA Coast of Terror, 1977) </p> <p> <strong> Big break:</strong> Mad Max (1979) </p> <p> <strong> Latest film: </strong> The Patriot (2000)</p>",

Amid a constellation of meteoric genius, Hegel had ripened only haltingly, his tenacious Swabian sensibility uncertain of its strengths and reach. At school, in the famous ecclesiastical Stift in T\u00fcbingen, he had shared quarters with H\u00f6lderlin and the precocious, wildly gifted Schelling. As Pinkard underlines, the metaphysical-lyric genius of H\u00f6lderlin was to be a life-long stimulus; Schelling would be the initial guide, the generous supporter of a seemingly lesser light, the defeated rival and, by eminent irony, the successor to Hegel's chair at the University of Berlin. </p> <p>While others forged ahead, Hegel spent laborious, though innerly productive years, as a house tutor, school-teacher, journalist and man of political letters in a series of more or less marginal posts. He ached for academic acceptance and preferment even after the publication of the Phenomenology. Hegel was 46 when appointed to a professorship at Heidelberg in 1816. Two years later followed the call to Berlin, where he would teach and exercise a formidable influence until his death in November 1832. Inevitably, a biography of Hegel is a saga of academic imbroglios and successive publications. </p> <p>Minutiae of professional intrigues, of the polemics between theological-political authorities and the nascent ideals of academic freedom, are Pinkard's meat. The reader is spared no detail. More rewarding is the emphasis, greater than in any previous biography, on Hegel's conviviality. His unforgiving abstruseness, the anti-charismatic technique of his lectures, an ill-disguised condescension towards even the most gifted of women, had made Hegel legend. </p> <p>Yet Pinkard shows how vividly he valued social contacts, the joy he took in theatre and opera and, above all, the almost childish delight this provincial universalist derived from his late visits to Holland and to France. The thought does haunt one that Hegel was in the same audience as Berlioz when a troupe of visiting Shakespearean actors performed in Paris. </p> <p>But what matters is the philosophic writing, much of it published only posthumously and from notes taken by ardent disciples (the analogy with Martin Heidegger is arresting). Having previously expounded the Phenomenology, Pinkard passes over it summarily in this biography. He is admirably lucid on the Logic and the Encyclopedia, showing how these monumental texts grow out of Hegel's determination to overcome the innocent discriminations between subject and object, between the ego and the world which, he felt, flawed German idealism and left crucial irresolutions in the edifice of Kant.</p> <p>At his best, Hegel has a sense of the 'density of being', of the dialectical interplay between consciousness and the existential tenacity of things unrivalled.

      "bodyText": "The Education Secretary David Blunkett rented his home out to a language teacher for \u00a3700 a month without declaring it in the register of MPs' interests. Last night Blunkett swiftly promised to record any future income as a landlord after the arrangement was revealed, adding that he had not believed he needed to register what was not a long-term venture. The revelation, however, ends a trying week for Blunkett, defeated in the High Court two days ago, after his plans for performance-related pay for teachers were ruled unlawful. Blunkett moved out of his one-bedroom flat in Wimbledon, south London, after Tony Blair offered him a rent free, government-owned flat in Belgravia. At first his student son lived in the flat, but in February Blunkett began renting it out through an agency to Lee Jenkins, a teacher of English to foreign students. Commons rules state that MPs should declare 'significant' rental income from properties not used as their own homes, but do not say how much is 'significant'. Parliamentary watchdogs have recognised it as a grey area and recently proposed setting a cap of around \u00a34,800 a year above which rental income would have to be declared. Blunkett said last night that his tenants had not originally paid any rent, and had then agreed to move out by July, so he had not regarded it as 'long-term income'. 'This is my home, and at some point I intend to move back into it,' he added. Blunkett said the rent money had been spent on repairs.

Richard Caborn is the Trade Minister in charge of the government agency that is being asked to provide up to \u00a3200 million for the dam, which will leave around 16,000 Kurds homeless. Last week the International Development Select Committee attacked the Department of Trade and Industry for putting British firms above human rights. Environmental and human rights groups opposed to the dam are increasingly concerned at the role of Caborn's parliamentary private secretary, the Labour MP Ben Chapman. He chairs the House of Commons All-Party Turkey Group, funded by the Istanbul-based Foreign Economic Relations Board. This board lobbies on behalf of the Turkish business community and supports the dam. The group's secretary, the Tory MP Tony Baldry, has close links to the construction industry, including Balfour Beatty - the British construction firm which has secured the contract to build the dam and stands to make a profit of millions if Caborn agrees to pay. Balfour Beatty was recently invited to address the Commons group.

      "bodyText": "Police are investigating a series of 'insane and unsigned' letters received by Germaine Greer in the 11 days since a student who assaulted and imprisoned her was put on probation. Yesterday Greer condemned the judicial system for exposing her to the possibility of further attack. Karen Burke, 19, was put on two years probation and required to undergo psychiatric treatment after pleading guilty to harassment and holding Greer against her will. Essex Police confirmed that a complaint made to Saffron Walden CID on Friday was being investigated. 'We need to establish the source of these letters,' said a spokesman. 'My kind pity is now choked by spleen,' said Greer. 'The police had informed me that the stalker was pleading guilty, but it was not made clear to me that she was pleading guilty to greatly reduced charges. The worst of it is that they reduced the distance she has to keep away from my house from 15 to five miles, because she said she needs to go to Cambridge \"for her studies\".

But to a growing number of entrepreneurs, youngsters forced by their traumatic family lives into the foster system are something else: a profit opportunity.</p> <p>Britain's chronic shortage of foster places has spawned a multi-million pound boom industry in which a rapidly expanding band of private companies is raking in massive amounts of money by renting foster families to local authorities desperate to find enough places.</p> <p>Critics are now demanding urgent government action, accusing the independent agencies of exploiting both the taxpayers and the children. Demand for foster places is at an all-time high and growing, with just 28,000 families caring for about 95,000 children a year.</p> <p>With more and more youngsters being forced into residential homes by the lack of appropriate family places, the National Foster Carers Association and the Department of Health last week launched a \u00a32 million campaign to recruit 7,000 more foster carers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the agencies are enjoying a golden period, charging councils up to \u00a31,500 a week for each child placed with families on their books.</p> <p>Of that money, the agencies will pass about \u00a3350 per child to the carers - almost double what they would get if working directly for the council - and the rest goes to the company. Critics claim that some of the higher-charging agencies may be making 50-60 per cent profit every week for every child placed with them.</p> <p>Keith Ferrin, Kent County Council's social services chairmen, said: 'I don't think there is any way to justify these sorts of charges.</p> <p>'Charging \u00a31,500 a week equates to \u00a378,000 a year per child. Even if the child was completely disabled and required round-the-clock care in a residential home, it wouldn't cost that much, and the children we are talking about require nothing like that level of care. It is a racket.'</p> <p>Of the 1,500 children Kent has in foster care, just 1 per cent are with agency families. But those placements account for more than 5 per cent of the council's fostering budget.</p> <p>In the last five years, the foster care market has exploded and there are now at least 80 companies nationwide. More than 20 of them are in Kent, supplying foster places to councils across the South-east, mainly the inner London boroughs.</p> <p>The highest-charging agency is Integrated Services Programme, set up in 1987 by a group of dis-illusioned council carers led by Bridgin Gorman. It charges councils \u00a31,575 a week per child for a service which includes specialist education and therapy. For children who do not require these additional services, the weekly charge is just over \u00a31,000.</p> <p>ISP is registered at Companies House as a 'not-for-profit' organisation, which means it has no shareholders and surpluses are reinvested. The four directors each receive a salary. The company's latest accounts illustrate the enormous sums of money circulating in the industry. In the year up to August 1999, ISP had a turnover of more than \u00a37.6m, generating a pre-tax surplus of \u00a31,244,712. With about 150 cases on its books at any one time, that equates to an annual surplus of more than \u00a38,200 per place.</p> <p>Richard Long, the company's secretary, said: 'Comparing our financial situation to those of councils is comparing apples and oranges. It is unfair to deduct the money we pay to carers from the weekly charge to councils and call the remainder profit.</p> <p>'We provide a very specialist service, dealing with the most difficult and challenging children, the older children whom councils find it almost impossible to place elsewhere. That is extremely costly. And nobody is making a profit from this. Every penny of surplus we generate has to be reinvested in the company.'</p> <p>But council placement officers say that, mostly, children have to be placed with whichever agency can offer a place, rather than matching them to the specialist services of a specific agency.</p> <p>Most of the newer agencies operate as normal businesses, and their fees vary widely. SFP, based near Etchingham, East Sussex, charges about \u00a3750 a week per placement, according to local authority figures. For an additional \u00a3150 per week, the agency provides limited education services. Its directors, Timothy Christmas and Mark Edmonds, refused to explain its charges.</p> <p>Another company, the London Fostering Agency, charges about \u00a3650 a week per place. Set up four years ago by two former Kensington and Chelsea senior social workers, it is now one of the biggest agencies in the country. Managing director Michael Lovett also declined to comment.</p> <p>But an indication of the type of profits being made by this new breed of agency comes from Terry Casey, a former Kent carer who set up Kent Homefinding and Family Services five years ago. Operating from a spacious converted house in Maidstone, the company employs seven social workers and support staff, and provides places for up to 80 children.</p> <p>It is one of the cheaper agencies, charging councils a flat fee of \u00a3595 a child per week. Even with these lower rates, Casey, a former salesman in the clothing trade, openly admits that the company is making good money.</p> <p>'I've been a businessman all my life and it's a very viable business. We don't cut corners, we provide a Rolls-Royce service, no different from some of the agencies charging more than \u00a31,000. We charge \u00a3595 a week, we pay our staff well, we pay our carers well, and we still make a very good living.'</p> <p>Critics of the companies claim by paying carers far more than social work deparments can afford, they are attracting families away from local authorities and so perpetuating the shortage.</p> <p>The agencies do have some supporters. Gerri McAndrew, director of the National Foster Carers Association, said: 'It is not about what they charge but the service they provide. On the whole, the independent agencies do a far better job of recruiting and supporting carers than most councils.'</p> <p>But critics like Ferrin remain unmoved. 'When you have a situation where local authorities know they are being taken for mugs but can do nothing about it, the Government has to intervene.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:stuart.millar@observer.co.uk\"> stuart.millar@observer.co.uk </a></p>",

In the year up to August 1999, ISP had a turnover of more than \u00a37.6m, generating a pre-tax surplus of \u00a31,244,712. With about 150 cases on its books at any one time, that equates to an annual surplus of more than \u00a38,200 per place. Richard Long, the company's secretary, said: 'Comparing our financial situation to those of councils is comparing apples and oranges. It is unfair to deduct the money we pay to carers from the weekly charge to councils and call the remainder profit. 'We provide a very specialist service, dealing with the most difficult and challenging children, the older children whom councils find it almost impossible to place elsewhere. That is extremely costly. And nobody is making a profit from this. Every penny of surplus we generate has to be reinvested in the company.' But council placement officers say that, mostly, children have to be placed with whichever agency can offer a place, rather than matching them to the specialist services of a specific agency. Most of the newer agencies operate as normal businesses, and their fees vary widely. SFP, based near Etchingham, East Sussex, charges about \u00a3750 a week per placement, according to local authority figures. For an additional \u00a3150 per week, the agency provides limited education services. Its directors, Timothy Christmas and Mark Edmonds, refused to explain its charges. Another company, the London Fostering Agency, charges about \u00a3650 a week per place. Set up four years ago by two former Kensington and Chelsea senior social workers, it is now one of the biggest agencies in the country. Managing director Michael Lovett also declined to comment. But an indication of the type of profits being made by this new breed of agency comes from Terry Casey, a former Kent carer who set up Kent Homefinding and Family Services five years ago. Operating from a spacious converted house in Maidstone, the company employs seven social workers and support staff, and provides places for up to 80 children. It is one of the cheaper agencies, charging councils a flat fee of \u00a3595 a child per week. Even with these lower rates, Casey, a former salesman in the clothing trade, openly admits that the company is making good money. 'I've been a businessman all my life and it's a very viable business. We don't cut corners, we provide a Rolls-Royce service, no different from some of the agencies charging more than \u00a31,000. We charge \u00a3595 a week, we pay our staff well, we pay our carers well, and we still make a very good living.' Critics of the companies claim by paying carers far more than social work deparments can afford, they are attracting families away from local authorities and so perpetuating the shortage. The agencies do have some supporters. Gerri McAndrew, director of the National Foster Carers Association, said: 'It is not about what they charge but the service they provide. On the whole, the independent agencies do a far better job of recruiting and supporting carers than most councils.' But critics like Ferrin remain unmoved. 'When you have a situation where local authorities know they are being taken for mugs but can do nothing about it, the Government has to intervene.' stuart.millar@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "A baby girl who was given just days to live because of a debilitating liver disorder is in a crucial but stable condition after undergoing a last-minute transplant. Doctors said seven-month-old Hannah Parkins, from Hyde, Greater Manchester, would die from liver failure because a suitable donor could not be found. But after a nationwide appeal for an organ by her parents proved successful, she was operated on at Birmingham Children's Hospital on Friday night. A hospital spokeswoman said: 'Hannah is in a stable condition but the next 24 hours are absolutely critical.' There are usually around 12 children waiting for liver transplants in one of the UK's two paediatric liver transplant centres at any one time. On average, two or three of these children will die because a donor cannot be found. 'It is great that this appeal found a suitable donor for Hannah but other children are not so lucky,' said Beverley Cornforth from the British branch of the Transplant Sports Association. 'It is vital that people are encouraged to carry donor cards.' Hannah was diagnosed six weeks ago as having biliary atresia, a condition which prevents her body processing waste from the liver. Birmingham Children's Hospital, one of the country's leading specialist centres, conducts about 45 transplants each year with a 90 per cent success rate but staff say they are forced to battle against a continual shortage of donors. 'After an appeal like this, the numbers of those willing to make donations will increase for a while but, after a bit, we're back where we started,' said one member of staff.",

'They take their clothes off for male magazines and present cartoons with a pout and a giggle worthy of the gameshow sidekicks of the Seventies.</p> <p>'This is a hugely exaggerated form of sexism that only exists in this part of television and it's getting worse,' she said.

      "bodyText": "Children are being put in danger and women's struggle for equality is being undermined by an entrenched culture of sexism in children's television, according to media experts. Younger viewers are encouraged to behave in overtly sexual ways by female presenters who are, in turn, pressured by producers and directors to adopt the subservient and decorative roles women have been struggling to reject for decades, they say. 'Children's television presenters are the last bastion of pure TV totty,' said Lowri Turner, presenter of The Lipstick Years, a six-part BBC2 series tracing the history of women on television, which starts tomorrow. 'They take their clothes off for male magazines and present cartoons with a pout and a giggle worthy of the gameshow sidekicks of the Seventies. 'This is a hugely exaggerated form of sexism that only exists in this part of television and it's getting worse,' she said. 'Television has improved hugely in terms of allowing women to take centre stage and having their own personalities but children's television presenters drag it all back into the dark ages.' Turner points to the actions of Gail Porter, whose 200ft-high nude figure was projected on to the Houses of Parliament by GQ magazine when she was presenting Fully Booked (now FBi) and who gave an explicit interview in which she talked candidly about her pierced nipple; Emma Ledden, who celebrated replacing Zoe Ball on Live and Kicking by stripping off for Loaded and FHM magazines; and Katy Hill, former Blue Peter presenter, who showed considerably more cleavage than Valerie Singleton ever did. 'None of these women is older than 25 and none has any serious journalistic or television training,' said Turner. She says producers battling with cable and satellite channels for viewers are aiming to attract male teenagers by encouraging presenters to appear in magazines such as FHM, Loaded and Maxim. Floella Benjamin, who is researching the effect that children's TV has on youngsters as they mature, believes that the explicit sexuality of presenters could encourage children to behave in a dangerously provocative manner. 'The oppressive air of sex that hangs over all children's television now is very dangerous and we're just touching the tip of the iceberg,' she said. Some children's TV presenters have admitted to The Observer that they often feel pressured to adopt a more explicitly sexual persona on television. Carol Vorderman, the highest paid performer on television who began her career presenting the Wide Awake Club in the early 1980s, is critical of women allowing themselves to be typecast as 'totty'. 'They're mistaken if they think they can play the dolly bird for a while and then escape into serious television,' she said. It is a problem that Kate Heavenor, the 19-year-old presenter of FBi, who posed for Sky and Maxim magazines earlier this year, admits to discovering too late. 'Posing in men's magazines is a canny move for children's presenters because we need to appeal to men and that's how they'll recognise you,' she said. 'I do mind having to look like the dolly bird of the show because, even when there are men presenting too, it's me who has to look light and fluffy.'

      "bodyText": "A Catholic civil servant miraculously survived a car bomb explosion believed to be the work of dissident loyalists. The attack is the first sign since the start of this year's Drumcree stand-off that some loyalist groups intend to carry out their threat to kill Catholics in Portadown. Senior RUC sources said loyalist terrorists placed the device underneath their intended victim's car on the Newcastle Road, outside Castlewellan. The victim's life was saved only because the device, which the security forces believe was a mercury tilt switch, failed to explode completely shortly before 10am yesterday. The 21-year-old man was taken to Downshire hospital nearby and was released with minor injuries. An SDLP Assemblyman for the area, Eamon O'Neil, said the injured man had no republican connections or any political involvement in the area. Last week The Observer revealed that the Mid-Ulster based Loyalist Volunteer Force and elements of the largest loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, planned a series of sectarian murders in a bid to force the Government to reverse the ban on Orangemen marching down the Garvaghy Road. A senior RUC officer warned last weekend: 'All our informants on the loyalist side, all our intelligence, point to a new strategy. They will kill a Catholic a day until the Orangemen get down the Garvaghy Road. Kill a Catholic a day in any part of Northern Ireland - it's as simple as that.' Since the warning was issued by senior RUC detectives, loyalist leaders in west and north Belfast along with LVF figures in Portadown have been under constant surveillance. It is understood that both the LVF and UFF units in west and north Belfast will not officially claim responsibility for murders and other sectarian attacks. Instead they will adopt a 'no claim, no blame' policy or invent a cover name such as one that has been used in the past, the Red Hand Defenders. Johnny Adair, the former UFF commander from Belfast's Shankill Road, has denied that the organisation is preparing to start a renewed terror campaign in alliance with the LVF. However, his supporters demonstrated their allegiance on the Lower Shankill Road last week when Loyalists painted slogans including 'UFF-LVF simply the best' near the mainly nationalist Antrim Road. The LVF has some support in the Protestant village of Clough near Castlewellan, home of Norman Coopey, an LVF member convicted of beating to death Catholic teenager James Morgan three years ago, and the site of the pit of animal carcasses where Coopey dumped the teenager's body. The use of a mercury tilt switch in the car bomb points to some involvement by elements of the UDA. UDA engineers were responsible for the booby-trap bomb that killed nationalist solicitor Rosemary Nelson outside her Lurgan home last year. LVF members from Portadown were thought to have placed the device under Mrs Nelson's car. The attack comes as serious divisions have emerged within the UDA over its relationship with the LVF. UDA brigades in west and north Belfast are known to be in favour of linking up with the LVF to form a new loyalist terror alliance. The UDA in south Belfast mistrusts the LVF and believes the organisation should adhere to its ceasefire and the policy of 'no first strike' against republicans and nationalists. Other UDA brigades such as east Belfast also have reservations about forming a coalition with the LVF. They see it as highly unstable and riddled with informants.",

On land reform, the consensus 'has come up with nonsensical ideas, like the community's right to buy, which in remote areas will have a very damaging impact on the rural economy'. 'They're all signed up to that because it's all part of the great Scottish consensus, part of the apology for the Highland Clearances.'</p> <p>On fox-hunting, he 'wouldn't pretend we're on the majority side of the argument in the country as a whole, but in the country areas you find there's a range of discontent over a whole range of issues'.</p> <p>His aim is to get the party into a position where it 'might be a minority in the Parliament but speaks for a majority in the country'. 'I'm trying to identify issues on which public opinion is on our side.'</p> <p>As a lawyer, he thinks the Scottish Parliament has value as an 'engine' for the reform and modernisation of Scots law, for which there was inadequate time at Westminster. He believes if the Tories replaced the SNP as the main opposition party, the constitutional issue might wither away.</p> <p>Through the Eighties the Scottish Tories were riven by factional disputes between the Thatcherites, led by Michael Forsyth, and the traditionalists who identified, sometimes to his embarrassment, with Malcolm Rifkind. Thatcher had to remove Forsyth from the chairmanship because of the turbulence.</p> <p>Such troubles resurfaced this year when Sir Adrian Shinwell resigned as chairman of the party's selection committee and old Westminster warhorse Bill Walker was elected deputy chairman.</p> <p>Ideology or personalities? McLetchie's face briefly darkens. 'This was a matter of personalities and incompatibilities which has now been closed.'</p> <p>Asked about reports that Walker had announced for himself a leading role in the election campaign, he said: 'Bill Walker isn't running the Westminster campaign. Malcolm Rifkind has been appointed by William Hague to lead it' - although experienced parliamentarians would have a significant role.</p> <p>He did not add that between Rifkind and Walker there is a history of enmity. The latest rows have revived suspicions that the party has moved to the Right.</p> <p>He is impatient with labels. He rejects some of the images of Thatcherism - the handbagging, the nanny in Number 10 - but retains many of its ideas about the free market. He thinks of himself as a liberal on social questions and talks of the need to sustain the public services on which civil society depends.</p> <p>If he had to wear a label it would bear the name of Forsyth. The two men first met when they were active in student Conservative politics - Forsyth at St Andrew's; McLetchie at Edinburgh.</p> <p>Both were born into a Scotland dominated by Labour councils and both saw collectivism as the enemy of energy and self-reliance. McLetchie's belief in 'individual progress and personal responsibility and the idea that you made your own way in the world' comes from his parents.</p> <p>'My father was a salesman in a gents' outfitter's shop; my mother was an office cleaner and subsequently a sales assistant in a stationery business. They had a very strong belief in getting on in the world.'</p> <p>Indeed, the failure of the poll tax, introduced first in Scotland, did not happen because it was flawed in principle, but because it acted against people, like his parents, who should have been natural Tory supporters.</p> <p>'Its major impact fell on people earning enough not to qualify for exemption and living in accommodation that had been relatively lowly rated [under the old system].</p> <p>'That section of the electorate, like my parents living in a relatively small flat, resented the poll tax because they had to pay significantly more. In retrospect, that was a poor political judgment on our part.'</p> <p>He concludes: 'The first year of the Parliament has gone very well for us. The Parliament has given us the platform to demonstrate that we are Scots and have Scotland's interests at heart.'</p> <p>As I leave he brandishes a cutting about business opposition to charges for parking at work. 'This is the next issue,' he says with relish. McLetchie has drive and determination: he is not to be underestimated.</p>",

His aim is to get the party into a position where it 'might be a minority in the Parliament but speaks for a majority in the country'. 'I'm trying to identify issues on which public opinion is on our side.' As a lawyer, he thinks the Scottish Parliament has value as an 'engine' for the reform and modernisation of Scots law, for which there was inadequate time at Westminster. He believes if the Tories replaced the SNP as the main opposition party, the constitutional issue might wither away. Through the Eighties the Scottish Tories were riven by factional disputes between the Thatcherites, led by Michael Forsyth, and the traditionalists who identified, sometimes to his embarrassment, with Malcolm Rifkind. Thatcher had to remove Forsyth from the chairmanship because of the turbulence. Such troubles resurfaced this year when Sir Adrian Shinwell resigned as chairman of the party's selection committee and old Westminster warhorse Bill Walker was elected deputy chairman. Ideology or personalities? McLetchie's face briefly darkens. 'This was a matter of personalities and incompatibilities which has now been closed.' Asked about reports that Walker had announced for himself a leading role in the election campaign, he said: 'Bill Walker isn't running the Westminster campaign. Malcolm Rifkind has been appointed by William Hague to lead it' - although experienced parliamentarians would have a significant role. He did not add that between Rifkind and Walker there is a history of enmity. The latest rows have revived suspicions that the party has moved to the Right. He is impatient with labels. He rejects some of the images of Thatcherism - the handbagging, the nanny in Number 10 - but retains many of its ideas about the free market. He thinks of himself as a liberal on social questions and talks of the need to sustain the public services on which civil society depends. If he had to wear a label it would bear the name of Forsyth. The two men first met when they were active in student Conservative politics - Forsyth at St Andrew's; McLetchie at Edinburgh. Both were born into a Scotland dominated by Labour councils and both saw collectivism as the enemy of energy and self-reliance. McLetchie's belief in 'individual progress and personal responsibility and the idea that you made your own way in the world' comes from his parents. 'My father was a salesman in a gents' outfitter's shop; my mother was an office cleaner and subsequently a sales assistant in a stationery business. They had a very strong belief in getting on in the world.' Indeed, the failure of the poll tax, introduced first in Scotland, did not happen because it was flawed in principle, but because it acted against people, like his parents, who should have been natural Tory supporters. 'Its major impact fell on people earning enough not to qualify for exemption and living in accommodation that had been relatively lowly rated [under the old system]. 'That section of the electorate, like my parents living in a relatively small flat, resented the poll tax because they had to pay significantly more. In retrospect, that was a poor political judgment on our part.' He concludes: 'The first year of the Parliament has gone very well for us. The Parliament has given us the platform to demonstrate that we are Scots and have Scotland's interests at heart.' As I leave he brandishes a cutting about business opposition to charges for parking at work. 'This is the next issue,' he says with relish. McLetchie has drive and determination: he is not to be underestimated.",

McDonald was even able to use his direct line to RUC commanders to ensure that the force's elite riot squad - the SAS-trained Mobile Support Unit - stayed out of Sandy Row.</p> <p>'On the first night of the Drumcree protests there was some trouble in the area and the MSU came in. A UDA member was arrested and beaten very severely near the bonfire by the MSU. This inflamed the situation and the kids went crazy.</p> <p>'We were able to negotiate with the police to take the MSU out of the area if we could get the kids to stop rioting. The tactic worked and things are much calmer even though some of the kids called me a spoilsport.'</p> <p>Evidence of the destructive force unleashed by Drumcree is all around Sandy Row. There are black scorch marks on the road leading towards the city centre. The wasteground around the huge bonfire which was lit on 11 July - the eve of loyalism's holiest date - is littered with broken bottles and bricks which were hurled at the RUC.</p> <p>But the area is now calm and even members of rival loyalist factions stop and speak to each other in Sandy Row. McDonald makes a point of talking to a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force who is selling CDs of loyalist songs in the street.</p> <p>In other parts of Belfast, UVF and UDA members are at daggers drawn; in Mid-Ulster the UVF and LVF are at war. Yet in Sandy Row, which saw a UVF murder bid on a young UDA man last year, an uneasy but workable peace has been established.</p> <p>McDonald is accompanied on his morning stroll through Sandy Row by Harry Smith, a city councillor with the UDA-aligned Ulster Democratic Party. Smith, who until last year belonged to Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, reiterates that loyalists in the area are fed up with being used as cannon fodder by the Orange Order and established unionist politicians.</p> <p>'By calming things down and not letting their communities be destroyed during Drumcree, the UDA is helping the UDP get some brownie points with the people. Any protests on the streets have been peaceful in this area thanks to the UDA and ex-prisoners like Jackie. People will support peaceful protests - they don't want their own areas turned upside down,' Smith said.</p> <p>Two weeks after the Drumcree protest began the cracks within Orangeism and loyalism are widening. The Orange Order's leadership are at loggerheads with their Portadown brethren over the continuation of street demonstrations. The Order's Grand Master Robert Saulters has called for end to demonstrations and hijackings.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the attitude of Jackie McDonald and his south Belfast loyalists is at variance with the views of some of their comrades on the Shankill Road and their LVF rivals in Mid Ulster. If Drumcree 2000 is remembered for anything, ironically it will be that the protests in Portadown have provoked more discord and disunity within the wider loyalist family than previous years.</p>",

Going back to war is dancing to somebody else's agenda not our own. I have been around too long and seen too many times where working-class loyalists were used by others to do their dirty work.' In an effort to defuse tensions in the south Belfast brigade area which stretches out of the city to Lisburn and right up to Newry on the border, McDonald and other ex-prisoners are on 24-hour call, visiting protests and ensuring demonstrations are peaceful. Sandy Row, one of the oldest and most deprived Protestant areas in the inner city, is calm after rioting in the early days of this year's Drumcree disturbances. McDonald was even able to use his direct line to RUC commanders to ensure that the force's elite riot squad - the SAS-trained Mobile Support Unit - stayed out of Sandy Row. 'On the first night of the Drumcree protests there was some trouble in the area and the MSU came in. A UDA member was arrested and beaten very severely near the bonfire by the MSU. This inflamed the situation and the kids went crazy. 'We were able to negotiate with the police to take the MSU out of the area if we could get the kids to stop rioting. The tactic worked and things are much calmer even though some of the kids called me a spoilsport.' Evidence of the destructive force unleashed by Drumcree is all around Sandy Row. There are black scorch marks on the road leading towards the city centre. The wasteground around the huge bonfire which was lit on 11 July - the eve of loyalism's holiest date - is littered with broken bottles and bricks which were hurled at the RUC. But the area is now calm and even members of rival loyalist factions stop and speak to each other in Sandy Row. McDonald makes a point of talking to a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force who is selling CDs of loyalist songs in the street. In other parts of Belfast, UVF and UDA members are at daggers drawn; in Mid-Ulster the UVF and LVF are at war. Yet in Sandy Row, which saw a UVF murder bid on a young UDA man last year, an uneasy but workable peace has been established. McDonald is accompanied on his morning stroll through Sandy Row by Harry Smith, a city councillor with the UDA-aligned Ulster Democratic Party. Smith, who until last year belonged to Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, reiterates that loyalists in the area are fed up with being used as cannon fodder by the Orange Order and established unionist politicians. 'By calming things down and not letting their communities be destroyed during Drumcree, the UDA is helping the UDP get some brownie points with the people. Any protests on the streets have been peaceful in this area thanks to the UDA and ex-prisoners like Jackie. People will support peaceful protests - they don't want their own areas turned upside down,' Smith said. Two weeks after the Drumcree protest began the cracks within Orangeism and loyalism are widening. The Orange Order's leadership are at loggerheads with their Portadown brethren over the continuation of street demonstrations. The Order's Grand Master Robert Saulters has called for end to demonstrations and hijackings. Meanwhile, the attitude of Jackie McDonald and his south Belfast loyalists is at variance with the views of some of their comrades on the Shankill Road and their LVF rivals in Mid Ulster. If Drumcree 2000 is remembered for anything, ironically it will be that the protests in Portadown have provoked more discord and disunity within the wider loyalist family than previous years.",

I saw the British at Dunkirk and I know they could not withstand an invasion,' he said. Meimberg received serious burns and a number of broken bones during his service as a fighter pilot, but he says that the struggle to survive after the war was more difficult than anything he experienced in battle. Unlike their counterparts in Britain, men like Meimberg and Baeker are at best forgotten and at worst reviled in their own country. A few tiny organisations, such as the German Fighter Pilots' Association, struggle to keep their traditions alive and to take care of veterans who find themselves in difficult circumstances. But the German public has little time for the defeated soldiers of a war that brought shame and destruction to their nation. 'War is not the continuation of politics by other means, war is the utter failure of politics and politicians. We're described as Hitler's soldiers, but that's a totally false view that we were ideologised,' said Meimberg. 'An Englishman who was shot down near us during the Battle of Britain said, \"You Germans have done one thing right in that you're so much against the Jews\". They were just the same as us.'

      "bodyText": "Wars of the future will be won by bombers flying at 10 times the speed of sound, palm-sized darts that suck data from the enemy's computers, and combat planes launched like missiles from submarines. These terrifying aerial machines of destruction sound like science fiction but most are on a drawing board in a military bunker or at a test base near you now and cost 'untold billions', according to a new book. They are destined to become the battle vehicles of the twenty-first century and consign today's humble fighters, jump jets and even the relatively advanced stealth planes in air force fleets to the history books. Warplanes of the Future (Salamander) by aerospace design consultant Mike Ryan and aviation expert David Oliver describes the astonishing aircraft designs being created and developed in Britain, the US and Russia. At one end of the scale is the giant Hypersoar aircraft designed to 'skip' on the upper atmosphere, cruising at Mach 10 (10 times the speed of sound), and drop bombs or even land to deliver troops anywhere on the Earth's surface within two hours of the outbreak of hostilities. Known as hypersonic strike aircraft, the necessary technology is well advanced in the US and is likely to be in service within 20 years - while the Russians are pioneering a smaller craft that is capable of accelerating to Mach 25. At the opposite end of the scale is the so-called micro-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to be tucked into the backpack of every platoon leader or SAS soldier advancing on enemy lines. Just six inches long and able to fly at 30mph for 30 minutes, the micro-UAV is controlled from a hand-held computer and can be sent silently into a target building to scan documents, maps and wall charts while relaying the information back in real time to a soldier waiting up to three miles away. The tiny remote-controlled dart would be capable of extracting data from the enemy's computer system or injecting it with a virus and, because it is so difficult to detect, it could also sneak into a bunker and release lethal gas. The US Defence Reseach Projects Agency is developing the mini-UAV as a cheap, expendable and highly effective close-quarters surveillance vehicle of the future. In Britain, defence contractors such as BAe Systems and consultants such as AVPRO, of which the book's author Mike Ryan is managing director, are busy designing a comprehensive Future Offensive Air System (FOAS) to give the Royal Air Force superiority in the digitised aerial battleground of 2017. This involves an advance fleet of unmanned reconnaissance and deep penetration, early-strike aircraft travelling undetected into hostile territory using stealth technology and high-speed manoeuvres unendurable by pilots. These would knock out the enemy's air defences, clearing the way for manned giant bombers firing cruise missiles. Ryan and Oliver write in their book: 'We are witness ing the development of fantastic machines that fly without pilots and perform staggering combat manoeuvres, all but immune to attack. 'It is not science fiction. The plans are on the drawing boards, test models are being made and flown, service entry is being scheduled.' AVPRO has developed a one-person pod designed to be launched just like a bomb from the wing of a jet or helicopter into hostile territory to pick up downed aircrew or drop special forces or bomb-disposal experts behind enemy lines. Once launched, the pod releases a steerable parachute and is dropped within a yard of the target zone, guided by satellite. It has an internal oxygen supply allowing its occupant to breathe at high altitude for many hours and can alight on land or water. Meanwhile, US defence giant Lockheed Martin is proposing to develop 'sky robots' which would be fired in the same way as Polaris missiles, from submarines lurking deep below the ocean's surface.

      "body": "<p>On Thursday morning at the top of each Minister's red box was an envelope stamped Treasury. Inside was a covering letter signed by Andrew Smith, the Chief Secretary to the Chancellor, Gordon Brown. The letter contained the most vital of news - the most important news, in fact, of Tony Blair's Government.</p> <p>Smith's note defined how much, exactly, each government department would be receiving in the comprehensive spending review. The review will set out where Brown will deploy his huge financial war chest over the next three years. It defines the battle lines for the next general election campaign.</p> <p>Some Ministers' smiles are broad this weekend. Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, will see the first rise in his ministry's budget since 1985, during the Cold War. The Government is tired of being embarrassed by stories of soldiers trying to talk to each other on mobile telephones that don't work.</p> <p>John Prescott's Department of Transport will have a lot more money to spend on trying to tackle chronic congestion in Britain. The Government has had enough of people sitting nose-to-tail in traffic jams nationwide.</p> <p>Even Stephen Byers, not one of Brown's favourites, will have a little to spend at the Department of Trade and Industry to encourage entrepreneurship among universities and their students.</p> <p>But the biggest smile of all will be reserved for one man. David Blunkett, the Secretary of State for Education, will receive an extra \u00a35.6 billion cash injection over the next three years to flood schools with new initiatives to finally kill, it is hoped, the idea that Britain has a failing education system. It works out at \u00a3200 per pupil, extra money which starts next year. To amend the famous phrase of Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, Blair will make it clear where he thinks the election will be won and lost - it's education, stupid.</p> <p>The money did not come without a battle. Over the last few weeks Blunkett has had a series of one-to-one meetings with Blair to press home his point that voters need to see the results of the myriad of education reforms introduced by the Government. Blair agreed and said that education should be the centrepiece of Tuesday's announcement. The Prime Minister hopes that it will lead the news agenda for days.</p> <p>The money will be used for increasing the number of staff in secondary schools, tackling the thousands of pupils who still leave school without qualifications, and raising standards for 11 to 14-year-olds. There will be more 'beacon schools', centres of excellence usually in the deprived inner cities. Blunkett also wants to put more resources into improving adult literacy. One remarkable figure that the Education Secretary wants to change is the fact that 1.3 million adults in Britain have the reading age of a seven-year-old.</p> <p>Focus group research reveals education's importance. Along with health, which received a similar boost in the Budget, it is at the top of the voters' agenda. But while large sums have been announced to achieve the manifesto targets of cutting classroom sizes in primary schools, parents still complain about overcrowded schools, peeling paint and lack of books. Children sitting in schools with leaking roofs and graffiti-daubed walls are not good images for New Labour.</p> <p>Blunkett now wants to target the money directly at the schools, increasing the one-off payments to heads to do with as they wish. He then wants results. It is another example of the micro-politics (showing people what is happening in their neighbourhood rather than bamboozling them with multi-billion-pound figures) which are the new mantra for Government.</p> <p>The education initiative is part of a package of measures that Blair wants to ensure are leading the agenda in the run-up to the summer recess, when Parliament closes down for August and most of September. If they trip up now the country will still be left with the sense of a Government consumed by troubles - the fiasco over Blair's policy for on-the-spot fines for hooligans, the Women's Institute speech, Blair's poor performance in Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons two weeks ago, the constant rumblings of a euro row.</p> <p>It will be done in two ways, two classic strategies beloved of the Downing Street communications arm. First will come the definition of what American campaigners call 'wedge issues'. Over the next two weeks Ministers and officials will constantly refer to the fact that, as far as they are concerned, the Conservative pledge on lower tax, lower spending, means that \u00a316 billion would need to be cut from the Government's budget. Every time a Conservative Minister gets up to complain about education or health or crime, the Government will come back and claim that the Tories would not be able to afford any new policies anyway.</p> <p>The second arm of the strategy is the 'drip, drip' policy. In a series of meetings with the Strategic Communications Unit in the room above No 10's front door, Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, has reiterated time and again the need for regular big-event announcements.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning Cabinet Ministers will make their way to the Cabinet Room in Downing Street. There Brown will lay out the speech he will make about the review to the Commons that afternoon. The day before, Blair will have made a speech to the American Bar Association conference in London in which he will initiate the broad themes Brown will touch on. This is the 'tantalise and then act' approach. The Government hopes that Tuesday's headlines will be all about the Prime Minister's words.</p> <p>It is probably a forlorn hope. On the same day, Paul Wiles, head of statistics at the Home Office, will be asked by Downing Street to brief the newspapers about the crime figures to be announced the next day.</p> <p>The reason is simple. The Government was left embarrassed when it was revealed that the crime figures, which will show an increase in violent offences, will be announced on the same day as the review, effectively hiding them under the welter of economic good news announcements. So the announcement has effectively been brought forward a day. Betty Boothroyd, the House of Commons Speaker, is unlikely to be amused that Parliament has been so obviously sidelined.</p> <p>After the Tuesday Cabinet, Brown will make his announcement to Parliament. His key adviser, Ed Balls, has been working endless hours in his office in the Treasury making sure the announcement is just right. What Balls doesn't want is 'Government throws money around' headlines. Equally, Blunkett has warned about the dangers of over-egging expectations. Everything will be couched in the new government narrative: it is only because we have managed the economy sensibly that we are able to spend so much money on delivery. The two things go hand in hand.</p> <p>After Brown, Blunkett will move centre stage, announcing on Tuesday how much of the education money will be spent. On Wednesday he will make further announcements. On Thursday Prescott will set out transport's 10-year plan.</p> <p>And that is when there could be another fly in the ointment. That night Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, will speak at a meeting of the Indigo Club, the elite fundraising arm of the 'Britain in Europe' campaign group. He will extol the virtues of the euro, testing to the limits the Government's prepare and decide policy.</p> <p>Brown is always nervous before Mandelson speaks, and usually angry afterwards. It was Mandelson's views on the euro which overshadowed Blair's speech on Europe to the Confederation of British Industry in May. Mandelson could do it again.</p> <p>The Government decided on its big-event strategy after Blair's appearance on the BBC's Question Time last Thursday. It was welcomed as a departure from the error-strewn days preceding it. He spoke about his son, found drunk in Leicester Square, and said he wouldn't be cowed on the euro. To try to continue the theme of Blair unspun, he agreed to an 'on the record' briefing in front of the press last week to get the message across that a million more jobs had been created since 1997. It worked.</p> <p>The next day the Government published its annual report. Although it explained how Blair's administration was achieving its manifesto commitments, it was undermined by errors in presentation. A new \u00a320 million sports centre in Sheffield was trumpeted as a government success, until it was pointed out the plans had been abandoned and the site of any new centre of excellence had actually been moved to London.</p> <p>Last month the Strategic Communications Unit which oversaw the report was told to bring the publication date forward two weeks. It was decided the report should lead into the CSR, should lead into transport, should lead into the announcement of the health plan next week. It led to a mad scramble and red faces.</p> <p>As Blair plans what he hopes will be his best week in power, the Tories will do their best to keep their heads above water. They will warn that Brown has produced huge-sounding sums before without delivering major improvements. Aware of the criticism, the Government now says it is in 'delivery mode'.</p> <p>Last week's U-turn by the Tories on the much-mocked tax guarantee was meant to clear the decks for a harder-edged attack. But it has caused them an acute political headache. The idea of promising to cut taxes over a Parliament no matter what was dreamt up last summer by Oliver Letwin, the fiercely cerebral, rather other-worldly ex-merchant banker turned junior Treasury spokesman, egged on by his then boss, Francis Maude.</p> <p>Michael Portillo, Shadow Chancellor, realised shortly after taking the joat it would not withstand the scrutiny of an election campaign. Fearful of talk of splits, both Hague and Portillo camps insist the decision to change it was made by both men.</p> <p>The Tory onslaught, painting Brown as a reckless 'tax and spend' Chancellor, is the start of their summer campaign. It is aimed at exploiting what they hope is growing cynicism about the Government's ability to deliver on micro-politics - to get classrooms painted and employ more nurses.</p> <p><b>Who wins in the handouts?</b><br></p> <p><b> Education</b></p> <p>Minister: David Blunkett</p> <p>The announcement: billions of extra money will be focused on the performance of secondary schools. New targets on the number of pupils gaining five GCSEs or more and achieving level 4 at key stage 2 (taken at age 11). Payments to be targeted directly at schools, bypassing local authorities. New initiatives on Beacon and inner-city schools. There will be more money for adult literacy programmes.</p> <p><b> Transport</b><br></p> <p>Minister: John Prescott</p> <p>The announcement: the 10-year strategy will include new road and rail schemes to tackle 20 congestion hotspots from Deeside in Scotland to the M27 at Southampton. Targets to increase rail passenger traffic by 50 per cent, freight traffic by 75 per cent. The building of bypasses will be put back on the agenda. A new Transport Direct service will allow people to contact one central phone number and website for all travel information. New fast bus routes and trams for cities.</p> <p><b> Defence</b></p> <p>Minister: Geoff Hoon</p> <p>The announcement: although the increase is relatively small at \u00a3200 million, its significance is not. The first increase in defence spending since 1985 will be used to improve the lot of soldiers who complain that conditions are still reminiscent of the Dark Ages. New equipment will be agreed and money diverted into maintaining the Army's presence in parts of Africa as well as Kosovo. New initiatives to improve the numbers who stay in the Army.</p> <p><b> Home Office</b></p> <p>Minister: Jack Straw</p> <p>The announcement: extra money is likely for tackling drug-related crime - drugs tsar Keith Hellawell wants to extend the drug treatment order programme, forcing addicted offenders into rehabilitation, which has produced promising early results. More money for crime prevention and tackling domestic violence.</p>",

The letter contained the most vital of news - the most important news, in fact, of Tony Blair's Government. Smith's note defined how much, exactly, each government department would be receiving in the comprehensive spending review. The review will set out where Brown will deploy his huge financial war chest over the next three years. It defines the battle lines for the next general election campaign. Some Ministers' smiles are broad this weekend. Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, will see the first rise in his ministry's budget since 1985, during the Cold War. The Government is tired of being embarrassed by stories of soldiers trying to talk to each other on mobile telephones that don't work. John Prescott's Department of Transport will have a lot more money to spend on trying to tackle chronic congestion in Britain. The Government has had enough of people sitting nose-to-tail in traffic jams nationwide. Even Stephen Byers, not one of Brown's favourites, will have a little to spend at the Department of Trade and Industry to encourage entrepreneurship among universities and their students. But the biggest smile of all will be reserved for one man. David Blunkett, the Secretary of State for Education, will receive an extra \u00a35.6 billion cash injection over the next three years to flood schools with new initiatives to finally kill, it is hoped, the idea that Britain has a failing education system. It works out at \u00a3200 per pupil, extra money which starts next year. To amend the famous phrase of Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, Blair will make it clear where he thinks the election will be won and lost - it's education, stupid. The money did not come without a battle. Over the last few weeks Blunkett has had a series of one-to-one meetings with Blair to press home his point that voters need to see the results of the myriad of education reforms introduced by the Government. Blair agreed and said that education should be the centrepiece of Tuesday's announcement. The Prime Minister hopes that it will lead the news agenda for days. The money will be used for increasing the number of staff in secondary schools, tackling the thousands of pupils who still leave school without qualifications, and raising standards for 11 to 14-year-olds. There will be more 'beacon schools', centres of excellence usually in the deprived inner cities. Blunkett also wants to put more resources into improving adult literacy. One remarkable figure that the Education Secretary wants to change is the fact that 1.3 million adults in Britain have the reading age of a seven-year-old. Focus group research reveals education's importance. Along with health, which received a similar boost in the Budget, it is at the top of the voters' agenda. But while large sums have been announced to achieve the manifesto targets of cutting classroom sizes in primary schools, parents still complain about overcrowded schools, peeling paint and lack of books. Children sitting in schools with leaking roofs and graffiti-daubed walls are not good images for New Labour. Blunkett now wants to target the money directly at the schools, increasing the one-off payments to heads to do with as they wish. He then wants results. It is another example of the micro-politics (showing people what is happening in their neighbourhood rather than bamboozling them with multi-billion-pound figures) which are the new mantra for Government. The education initiative is part of a package of measures that Blair wants to ensure are leading the agenda in the run-up to the summer recess, when Parliament closes down for August and most of September. If they trip up now the country will still be left with the sense of a Government consumed by troubles - the fiasco over Blair's policy for on-the-spot fines for hooligans, the Women's Institute speech, Blair's poor performance in Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons two weeks ago, the constant rumblings of a euro row. It will be done in two ways, two classic strategies beloved of the Downing Street communications arm. First will come the definition of what American campaigners call 'wedge issues'. Over the next two weeks Ministers and officials will constantly refer to the fact that, as far as they are concerned, the Conservative pledge on lower tax, lower spending, means that \u00a316 billion would need to be cut from the Government's budget. Every time a Conservative Minister gets up to complain about education or health or crime, the Government will come back and claim that the Tories would not be able to afford any new policies anyway. The second arm of the strategy is the 'drip, drip' policy. In a series of meetings with the Strategic Communications Unit in the room above No 10's front door, Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, has reiterated time and again the need for regular big-event announcements. On Tuesday morning Cabinet Ministers will make their way to the Cabinet Room in Downing Street. There Brown will lay out the speech he will make about the review to the Commons that afternoon. The day before, Blair will have made a speech to the American Bar Association conference in London in which he will initiate the broad themes Brown will touch on. This is the 'tantalise and then act' approach. The Government hopes that Tuesday's headlines will be all about the Prime Minister's words. It is probably a forlorn hope. On the same day, Paul Wiles, head of statistics at the Home Office, will be asked by Downing Street to brief the newspapers about the crime figures to be announced the next day. The reason is simple. The Government was left embarrassed when it was revealed that the crime figures, which will show an increase in violent offences, will be announced on the same day as the review, effectively hiding them under the welter of economic good news announcements. So the announcement has effectively been brought forward a day. Betty Boothroyd, the House of Commons Speaker, is unlikely to be amused that Parliament has been so obviously sidelined. After the Tuesday Cabinet, Brown will make his announcement to Parliament. His key adviser, Ed Balls, has been working endless hours in his office in the Treasury making sure the announcement is just right. What Balls doesn't want is 'Government throws money around' headlines. Equally, Blunkett has warned about the dangers of over-egging expectations. Everything will be couched in the new government narrative: it is only because we have managed the economy sensibly that we are able to spend so much money on delivery. The two things go hand in hand. After Brown, Blunkett will move centre stage, announcing on Tuesday how much of the education money will be spent. On Wednesday he will make further announcements. On Thursday Prescott will set out transport's 10-year plan. And that is when there could be another fly in the ointment. That night Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, will speak at a meeting of the Indigo Club, the elite fundraising arm of the 'Britain in Europe' campaign group. He will extol the virtues of the euro, testing to the limits the Government's prepare and decide policy. Brown is always nervous before Mandelson speaks, and usually angry afterwards. It was Mandelson's views on the euro which overshadowed Blair's speech on Europe to the Confederation of British Industry in May. Mandelson could do it again. The Government decided on its big-event strategy after Blair's appearance on the BBC's Question Time last Thursday. It was welcomed as a departure from the error-strewn days preceding it. He spoke about his son, found drunk in Leicester Square, and said he wouldn't be cowed on the euro. To try to continue the theme of Blair unspun, he agreed to an 'on the record' briefing in front of the press last week to get the message across that a million more jobs had been created since 1997. It worked. The next day the Government published its annual report. Although it explained how Blair's administration was achieving its manifesto commitments, it was undermined by errors in presentation. A new \u00a320 million sports centre in Sheffield was trumpeted as a government success, until it was pointed out the plans had been abandoned and the site of any new centre of excellence had actually been moved to London. Last month the Strategic Communications Unit which oversaw the report was told to bring the publication date forward two weeks. It was decided the report should lead into the CSR, should lead into transport, should lead into the announcement of the health plan next week. It led to a mad scramble and red faces. As Blair plans what he hopes will be his best week in power, the Tories will do their best to keep their heads above water. They will warn that Brown has produced huge-sounding sums before without delivering major improvements. Aware of the criticism, the Government now says it is in 'delivery mode'. Last week's U-turn by the Tories on the much-mocked tax guarantee was meant to clear the decks for a harder-edged attack. But it has caused them an acute political headache. The idea of promising to cut taxes over a Parliament no matter what was dreamt up last summer by Oliver Letwin, the fiercely cerebral, rather other-worldly ex-merchant banker turned junior Treasury spokesman, egged on by his then boss, Francis Maude. Michael Portillo, Shadow Chancellor, realised shortly after taking the joat it would not withstand the scrutiny of an election campaign. Fearful of talk of splits, both Hague and Portillo camps insist the decision to change it was made by both men. The Tory onslaught, painting Brown as a reckless 'tax and spend' Chancellor, is the start of their summer campaign. It is aimed at exploiting what they hope is growing cynicism about the Government's ability to deliver on micro-politics - to get classrooms painted and employ more nurses. Who wins in the handouts? Education Minister: David Blunkett The announcement: billions of extra money will be focused on the performance of secondary schools. New targets on the number of pupils gaining five GCSEs or more and achieving level 4 at key stage 2 (taken at age 11). Payments to be targeted directly at schools, bypassing local authorities. New initiatives on Beacon and inner-city schools. There will be more money for adult literacy programmes. Transport Minister: John Prescott The announcement: the 10-year strategy will include new road and rail schemes to tackle 20 congestion hotspots from Deeside in Scotland to the M27 at Southampton. Targets to increase rail passenger traffic by 50 per cent, freight traffic by 75 per cent. The building of bypasses will be put back on the agenda. A new Transport Direct service will allow people to contact one central phone number and website for all travel information. New fast bus routes and trams for cities. Defence Minister: Geoff Hoon The announcement: although the increase is relatively small at \u00a3200 million, its significance is not. The first increase in defence spending since 1985 will be used to improve the lot of soldiers who complain that conditions are still reminiscent of the Dark Ages. New equipment will be agreed and money diverted into maintaining the Army's presence in parts of Africa as well as Kosovo. New initiatives to improve the numbers who stay in the Army. Home Office Minister: Jack Straw The announcement: extra money is likely for tackling drug-related crime - drugs tsar Keith Hellawell wants to extend the drug treatment order programme, forcing addicted offenders into rehabilitation, which has produced promising early results. More money for crime prevention and tackling domestic violence.",

      "body": "<p>The British Government was yesterday in deepening disarray over a case which opens in the High Court tomorrow. It stands accused of illegally removing an entire people from their Chagos Islands homeland, so that a US military base could be built on Diego Garcia, and pretending to the world that they never lived there.</p> <p>Junior Foreign Office Minister Baroness Scotland disclosed last week that the Government had arranged for three of the islanders to return to the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to see conditions for themselves.</p> <p>Three of them visited Peros Banhos from 9 to 13 June and were not in any way deterred by the overgrown state of a tropical island left unattended for 30 years.</p> <p>By allowing the visit the Foreign Office may have given the impression that it was considering a policy U-turn. The possibility that people might return was something it had previously ruled out. In keeping with its tortuous and secretive dealings in the case over 30 years or so, the Foreign Office had insisted that the visit should not be publicised. Yesterday the islanders expressed astonishment at its disclosure. 'We were asked to keep it confidential,' said islander Louis Olivier Bancoult.</p> <p>Bancoult is bringing the case on behalf of some 2,000 British subjects removed so that the American base could be built on the U-shaped atoll of Diego Garcia. He will claim that his removal and continued exclusion is unlawful.</p> <p>Between 1966 and the early Seventies, the native population of the islands of Diego Garcia, Peros Banhos and Salomon - known as the Ilois people - say that they were removed from their homelands. The three islands - which make up the Chagos Islands - are with Aldabra, Desroches and Farquhar part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, a colony formed in 1965. Until then they had been part of Mauritius, which was offered independence that year on condition that it hived them off to Britain. Britain then leased the colony to the US for 50 years. The people of the Chagos Islands fished, harvested coconuts, grew vegetables and reared poultry. When I visited Mauritius in the early Eighties, I was told they had been told they could not stay 'because the Americans were coming. We didn't want to go; we were born there, so were our fathers and grand-fathers, who are buried there'.</p> <p>The Ilois were taken to Mauritius more than 1,250 miles away and turned into poverty-stricken exiles. It was seven years before Britain gave them compensation, and an eventual \u00a34 million in 1982 was not enough for the Ilois either to buy land or train for employment. Today 90 per cent of them are jobless and living in the slums of Mauritius's capital, Port Louis.</p> <p>In the High Court last year Bancoult, who is chairman of the Chagos Refugee Group in Mauritius, won the right to bring this week's action over his claim. Should he win the case, the door would be open for the Ilois to return home.</p> <p>The Government has attempted to portray the islanders as 'contract labourers' on these islands, a claim contradicted by a Colonial Office film in the Fifties which spoke of the Chagos being inhabited 'mostly by men and women born and brought up in the islands'.</p> <p>Almost all the 447 surviving adults removed from the Chagos want the right to return, says Bancoult, as do most of the 3,800 children since born to the exiles. Only the western side of Diego Garcia is used for the US base, he points out, and the islanders could live on the eastern side and on Peros Banhos and Salomon, both of which are empty and more than 100 miles from Diego Garcia. Companies in Mauritius have expressed interest in opening up the Chagos Islands again. Fishing, eco-tourism, snorkelling and handicrafts would be viable propositions, says Bancoult, who was born on Peros Banhos.</p> <p>Diego Garcia was chosen for a military base in the Sixties in preference to the nearby island of Aldabra, which is uninhabited and renowned for its large tortoises.

      "bodyText": "The British Government was yesterday in deepening disarray over a case which opens in the High Court tomorrow. It stands accused of illegally removing an entire people from their Chagos Islands homeland, so that a US military base could be built on Diego Garcia, and pretending to the world that they never lived there. Junior Foreign Office Minister Baroness Scotland disclosed last week that the Government had arranged for three of the islanders to return to the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to see conditions for themselves. Three of them visited Peros Banhos from 9 to 13 June and were not in any way deterred by the overgrown state of a tropical island left unattended for 30 years. By allowing the visit the Foreign Office may have given the impression that it was considering a policy U-turn. The possibility that people might return was something it had previously ruled out. In keeping with its tortuous and secretive dealings in the case over 30 years or so, the Foreign Office had insisted that the visit should not be publicised. Yesterday the islanders expressed astonishment at its disclosure. 'We were asked to keep it confidential,' said islander Louis Olivier Bancoult. Bancoult is bringing the case on behalf of some 2,000 British subjects removed so that the American base could be built on the U-shaped atoll of Diego Garcia. He will claim that his removal and continued exclusion is unlawful. Between 1966 and the early Seventies, the native population of the islands of Diego Garcia, Peros Banhos and Salomon - known as the Ilois people - say that they were removed from their homelands. The three islands - which make up the Chagos Islands - are with Aldabra, Desroches and Farquhar part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, a colony formed in 1965. Until then they had been part of Mauritius, which was offered independence that year on condition that it hived them off to Britain. Britain then leased the colony to the US for 50 years. The people of the Chagos Islands fished, harvested coconuts, grew vegetables and reared poultry. When I visited Mauritius in the early Eighties, I was told they had been told they could not stay 'because the Americans were coming. We didn't want to go; we were born there, so were our fathers and grand-fathers, who are buried there'. The Ilois were taken to Mauritius more than 1,250 miles away and turned into poverty-stricken exiles. It was seven years before Britain gave them compensation, and an eventual \u00a34 million in 1982 was not enough for the Ilois either to buy land or train for employment. Today 90 per cent of them are jobless and living in the slums of Mauritius's capital, Port Louis. In the High Court last year Bancoult, who is chairman of the Chagos Refugee Group in Mauritius, won the right to bring this week's action over his claim. Should he win the case, the door would be open for the Ilois to return home. The Government has attempted to portray the islanders as 'contract labourers' on these islands, a claim contradicted by a Colonial Office film in the Fifties which spoke of the Chagos being inhabited 'mostly by men and women born and brought up in the islands'. Almost all the 447 surviving adults removed from the Chagos want the right to return, says Bancoult, as do most of the 3,800 children since born to the exiles. Only the western side of Diego Garcia is used for the US base, he points out, and the islanders could live on the eastern side and on Peros Banhos and Salomon, both of which are empty and more than 100 miles from Diego Garcia. Companies in Mauritius have expressed interest in opening up the Chagos Islands again. Fishing, eco-tourism, snorkelling and handicrafts would be viable propositions, says Bancoult, who was born on Peros Banhos. Diego Garcia was chosen for a military base in the Sixties in preference to the nearby island of Aldabra, which is uninhabited and renowned for its large tortoises. In 1982, on an ITV World in Action programme called 'Britain's Other Islanders', a backbench Labour MP gave support to the Ilois cause, pointing out that 'the Americans were not allowed to develop on Aldabra because it would mean disturbing giant tortoises'. The tortoises won; the people lost. That MP was Robin Cook. Since becoming Foreign Secretary, he has been quiet on the Ilois.

Chaudhry, who was released last Thursday from eight weeks' captivity with 17 other MPs, said the national crisis continued because of the disenfranchisement of ethnic Indians and a guarantee of the superiority of indigenous Fijians. These moves had 'torn at the very fabric of society', said the first ethnic Indian to lead Fiji. The rebel leader George Speight now wants new President Ratu Josefa Iloilo to confirm all Speight's nominees as Ministers in an interim government, and set up a commission to rewrite the constitution along racial lines. The rebels appear to be unmoved by a threat of international sanctions. If Iloilo does not succumb, the rebels threaten a return to the occupation of police stations, other public buildings and holiday resorts. Iloilo, himself a Speight nominee, was expected to name the cabinet by tomorrow. Rumours abounded of scenarios he might pursue. Chaudhry said: 'I feel sorry for him,' pointing out that some people will be unhappy whatever Iloilo does. The new president is 79, suffers from Parkinson's disease and relies on bottled oxygen. The Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's traditional power, tacitly endorsed Speight's goals by agreeing to his nominees. Chaudhry, who was denied access to news during his captivity, is catching up with what happened outside and looking for ways to achieve reinstatement. 'The opposite of this would be to condone an act of anarchy and unlawful seizure of the government,' he said. 'At all costs we must support democracy.' Officials from the ousted coalition government are to meet this week to consider legal options. Chaudhry endorsed the threat of sanctions. 'A vocal and violent minority holds the whole country ransom,' Chaudhry, freshly shaved and shorn of the locks he grew in captivity, told reporters at his home. Concern for the future intensified after the military reported yesterday that Speight's men had not turned in all the weapons they seized from an armoury during the storming of parliament on 19 May. Ethnic Indians, disenfranchised and despondent, are trying to regroup amid growing emigration that will cut their 44 per cent share of the population. Chaudhry dismissed the idea of setting up a government in exile, perhaps in Australia. 'I think we're very comfortable here,' he said.

      "bodyText": "A crucial Supreme Court hearing to examine the first of 137 criminal cases against Augusto Pinochet was postponed last week after a mysterious car accident that nearly killed a leading human rights lawyer. The incident occurred on a deserted road north of Santiago when a pick-up truck slammed into the parked car of Eduardo Contreras. He had stopped, as he was heading home from the coast, to help another motorist who had mechanical problems. When a red pick-up truck crossed the road and swerved into his car, Contreras leapt aside and escaped unscathed. But his wife was trapped in the wreckage and is in a critical condition with kidney damage and the probability that she will lose a leg. Contreras has repeatedly been the target of death threats and until two months ago was accompanied by a state-appointed bodyguard. Earlier this year the authorities warned him his name headed a right-wing hit list. 'I can't help but think that this was an action by sectors who wanted to threaten us,' said Contreras, who is also a prominent member of the Chilean Communist Party. 'I don't have proof, but I do have all the right in the world to link this with the previous circumstances [threats] that are well known to everyone.' Last Thursday police arrested a man and declared the incident a normal traffic accident, a claim that incensed Contreras, who again denounced the incident as a political attack. An anonymous telephone call from the right-wing terrorist group Patria y Libertad - 'Fatherland and Liberty' - claimed credit for the attack but provided no corroborating evidence. Communist Party activists are clamouring for more protection. 'There have been repeated burglaries of our homes, death threats by telephone and a continual climate of hostility,' said Lautaro Camarona, 48, a top official in the party. 'In Chile, there are still paramilitary groups like those of the [Pinochet] dictatorship and they have the government cornered.' Contreras, one of seven lawyers seeking to have Pinochet stripped of his senatorial immunity and put on trial, is widely known for his role in presenting the first criminal complaint accepted by the courts, in January 1998. Contreras is an accomplished orator and charismatic attorney who was to lead the oral arguments against Pinochet. These arguments have now been postponed until Wednesday. If the Supreme Court confirms a lower court ruling that stripped the ageing ex-dictator of senatorial immunity, Pinochet could face criminal prosecution for his role in co-ordinating a 1973 helicopter hit squad that roamed Chile and left at least 72 political prisoners dead. He could also be prosecuted for some or all of the 143 other criminal complaints against his former regime that are being investigated by the courts. Pinochet's defence team plans to fight in the Supreme Court, where the vote is expected to be tight. Its primary strategy is to claim that Pinochet, 84, suffers both mental and physical illnesses that make him unfit for trial. The Pinochet team has fought bitterly - and thus far unsuccessfully - to have those tests carried out before the immunity hearing. In the past weeks, however, the hearing has been overshadowed by a historic agreement known as the Mesa de Dialogo (Table of Dialogue) in which human-rights lawyers and top army officials met privately for nearly a year in sessions mediated by Cabinet-level politicians. The purpose was to convince the armed forces to disclose the whereabouts of the estimated 1,200 Chileans executed and 'disappeared' by Pinochet-era death squads. The final agreement, signed on 16 June, became effective this month and specifies that the military must release information. Last week General Carlos Salgado met middle and low-level retired army officers to convince them they would be protected if they participated in the search process anonymously. These officials are believed to have detailed information about the burial of several hundred corpses. The key element of the accord is to maintain the secret identity of the informants. If a recent public confession made by retired army officer Roberto Flores is any indication, voluntary confessions may not be particularly easy. Flores stunned the nation last month with a television interview in which he claimed to have witnessed dozens of executions inside the National Stadium prison camp created in the wake of the coup on 11 September 1973 which overthrew the left-wing coalition government of Salvador Allende. Last week, Flores was again on television, this time denouncing the rash of death threats he had received. Pamela Pereira, a human-rights lawyer who helped to negotiate the accord and whose father was among the victims, remained optimistic that the secret law would reveal new information. 'I am tired, but relieved,' she said. 'I am convinced information on what happened to the disappeared will be revealed within six months, or at most a year.' President Ricardo Lagos and army Commander-in-Chief Ricardo Izurieta have apparently agreed to a 'realistic' goal in which approximately 300 of the missing will be accounted for under the new agreement. These cases would include 'VIP' victims and thus placate the government and the military's most ardent critics.

Chancellor Gordon Brown will present the results of his second Comprehensive Spending Review, detailing the expected growth of public spending by department and programme for the three years from next April. This is New Labour's opportunity to show its serious intent to rebuild Britain's desiccated and neglected public services, to begin the long process of restoring faith in government and in so doing to demonstrate that it remains at heart a party of the centre and centre-Left.</p> <p>The omens are that it means to capitalise upon the strength of Britain's public finances - the result of eight years of economic growth and of Brown's careful levying of extra taxation in the early years of this parliament. The results are that even last November the Chancellor could announce that public spending would grow by 3.3 per cent over three years from 2001, the total including debt interest and social security spending.</p> <p>But since then, debt interest has been reduced by the proceeds of the mobile phone auction and unemployment has fallen, further reducing projected social security spending, so that another \u00a33 billion a year is available to boost departmental spending. New Labour can now ensure that education, transport, environment, the inner cities and law and order receive spending increases - and divert yet more resources to health.</p> <p>Judging from the pre-CSR leaks, this is precisely what it intends to do - presenting Britain with the longest and most sustained increase in public provision since the Fifties. Moreover, the Government has spent the last three years attempting to establish that new resources of this scale are not squandered. The last CSR was overhyped with modest increases in spending double- and treble-counted in a New Labour exercise of putting spin before substance, and leading to the calamitous consequence of expectations running ahead of reality. This time, the danger is the opposite. Distrust of spin and New Labour may prevent us from seeing the sheer scale of the potential improvement.</p> <p>It also puts the Conservatives on the spot, opening up a genuine ideological division between the parties and relaunching serious political debate. For the Tories shrink before spending resources on this scale on public provision; their first instinct remains tax cuts and shrinking the state. Yet the Tories dare only to promise tax cuts while simultaneously matching what they know will be Labour's popular increases in education and health spending, so that their sums fail to add up.</p> <p>The CSR thus equips New Labour with the ammunition to set the political agenda - something it has failed to do since 1997, preferring to conduct policy within the ideological framework it inherited from the Conservatives. Brown and Blair may have taken centre-Left politics into new realms of cautiousness and outright timidity, but there is a popular core of principle from which even they will not depart. They see high and effective levels of public provision as the sole means of ensuring opportunity and social well-being for all. Now they are backing their beliefs with cash on a vast scale.</p> <p>Not everything in the CSR, however, will be rosy. The retreat from the Beveridgian principle of social insurance will continue. The review is predicated upon the growth of social security spending being uprated only in line with prices rather than earnings. Only children and pensioners with no other financial means of support than the state are deemed worthy of fair treatment. Too little money will be earmarked to pay public sector workers, now lagging scandalously behind the private sector.</p> <p>University lecturers, for example, have seen no real increases in pay for 20 years. And the Government will not take the opportunity to abandon the worst absurdities of the private finance initiative, so that new PFI hospitals are smaller, harsher and with less able to provide acute surgery and long-term convalescence than their publicly funded counterparts. The CSR has been designed to entrench middle-class support; it is not a crusade against the disfiguring consequences of poverty and inequality, which are reduced only as side-effects of the thrust to improve public services.</p> <p>Yet for all those weaknesses it remains an important political moment. New Labour at last can be seen to embody different values and principles from its opponents. Over the last week the Prime Minister has shown a welcome new-found poise and conviction, almost as if he has at last realised that there is no further mileage in trying to be all things to all men and covering his tracks with spin. He must stand for something. Next Tuesday we will see precisely what.</p>",

It also puts the Conservatives on the spot, opening up a genuine ideological division between the parties and relaunching serious political debate. For the Tories shrink before spending resources on this scale on public provision; their first instinct remains tax cuts and shrinking the state. Yet the Tories dare only to promise tax cuts while simultaneously matching what they know will be Labour's popular increases in education and health spending, so that their sums fail to add up. The CSR thus equips New Labour with the ammunition to set the political agenda - something it has failed to do since 1997, preferring to conduct policy within the ideological framework it inherited from the Conservatives. Brown and Blair may have taken centre-Left politics into new realms of cautiousness and outright timidity, but there is a popular core of principle from which even they will not depart. They see high and effective levels of public provision as the sole means of ensuring opportunity and social well-being for all. Now they are backing their beliefs with cash on a vast scale. Not everything in the CSR, however, will be rosy. The retreat from the Beveridgian principle of social insurance will continue. The review is predicated upon the growth of social security spending being uprated only in line with prices rather than earnings. Only children and pensioners with no other financial means of support than the state are deemed worthy of fair treatment. Too little money will be earmarked to pay public sector workers, now lagging scandalously behind the private sector. University lecturers, for example, have seen no real increases in pay for 20 years. And the Government will not take the opportunity to abandon the worst absurdities of the private finance initiative, so that new PFI hospitals are smaller, harsher and with less able to provide acute surgery and long-term convalescence than their publicly funded counterparts. The CSR has been designed to entrench middle-class support; it is not a crusade against the disfiguring consequences of poverty and inequality, which are reduced only as side-effects of the thrust to improve public services. Yet for all those weaknesses it remains an important political moment. New Labour at last can be seen to embody different values and principles from its opponents. Over the last week the Prime Minister has shown a welcome new-found poise and conviction, almost as if he has at last realised that there is no further mileage in trying to be all things to all men and covering his tracks with spin. He must stand for something. Next Tuesday we will see precisely what.",

      "body": "<p>There is rising concern about political disengagement. Turnout at elections is low and getting lower. The London mayoral contest tempted only 34 per cent of the electorate to vote. At the same time, party membership is dropping. New Labour temporarily reversed this long-term trend when Tony Blair's appeal was at its freshest, but in the past two years the decline has begun again.</p> <p>The status of politicians has also declined. Being an MP is nothing like as important as it used to be; being a local councillor even less so. We have yet to see what standing the new Scottish and Welsh representatives will earn, although the early signs are not good. After a few decades, MEPs have failed to increase their status among voters.</p> <p>Various explanations are given for this decline: ideology is dead and class allegiance less strong; the differences between parties are much less sharp; a lazy cynicism about politics and politicians pervades public debate.</p> <p>Reinforcing this disrespect for traditional politics is the decline in media coverage of serious political issues. The broadsheets have cut back parliamentary reporting and are almost as interested in the personal and the sensational as the tabloids. ITV has killed off News at Ten . The BBC is marginalising Panorama. Specialist political current affairs has disappeared from Channel 4.</p> <p>But this is not because the journalists and producers have become bored with politics - far from it. These developments took place because papers and TV organisations picked up the changing tastes of their readers and audiences - and over the past 20 years these have moved away from an interest in politics. In this sense, the media have responded to the 'crisis of disengagement' more effectively than the politicians.</p> <p>For the past 200 years, it has made sense to be politically active - in the first instance, to try to win the vote if you didn't have it, and thereafter to use it either to improve your lot or to defend what you had. In addition, you knew that the abilities of those elected to run the country could determine whether you would have to fight a war or watch the men in your family do so. Politics mattered. Now many people think it doesn't matter. And surely they are right.</p> <p>Today, it is reasonable for most of us in mainland Britain to assume that we are not going to be killed in a war. And Margaret Thatcher put an end to the idea that either national or local government would find you a job or a home. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have shown that Labour can run the economy as well as the Tories - so we are all technocrats now. And while it remains possible that different politicians with different policies will be more or less able to improve education, health provision and transport, it is not always easy to know enough about the the details of policy to enable you to decide how to vote on those issues. So voting has lost much of its direct link to many of the things which are most important to people.</p> <p>People's lives have become much fuller and richer. There is more to do, and more money to do it with. The time when going out to political meetings was a form of leisure activity is long past.</p> <p>For a minority of people, political values form an important part of their identity. Some people care sufficiently about particular issues such as the environment to become actively engaged. This kind of political activity is almost a lifestyle thing - not very different from deciding to be a vegetarian or a jogger.</p> <p>So why is political disengagement said to be a problem? People on the Left say that without the belief that life can be improved by political action the status quo will always prevail. Others argue that there is a more basic problem: if no one will stand up for liberal democracy, then extremists will start to win elections. But surely this would be self-correcting; in such circumstances, the majority would stir itself to vote its representatives back in.</p> <p>Alternatively, we could find that the range of people willing to take part in politics begins to narrow - our representatives would not be extremists but specialists, and thus unrepresentative in a different way. This is already happening. Westminster politics is becoming professionalised. MPs are increasingly drawn from people in the para-political professions - political PR people, advisers, researchers, think-tankers, journalists. It is possible to start your career in such a job, move into Parliament, then go back if you lose your seat.</p> <p>The new political professionals have another asset. They are generally well-equipped by their backgrounds to handle the day-to-day technicalities of legislation, they can master a wide range of issues to a respectable level, and can make reasonable assessments of the extent to which a lobbyist's case coincides with the wider public interest. We are unlikely to see the likes of Ernest Bevin - or even Margaret Thatcher - emerge from such a political class, but politics no longer requires such figures.</p> <p>This does not mean that we will be worse governed. As a broadcasting lobbyist for the past 13 years, I have seen a big improvement in the way governments and their officials have developed policy. I also know that in the same period the European Parliament has done an excellent job in scrutinising media policy. The process has been helped by the existence of a small number of specialist journalists able to report the industry's affairs intelligently.</p> <p>However, this high-level discourse is carried out by small \u00e9lites. Most of us don't know it is going on, and wouldn't much care if we did. I assume that similar processes have been at work in other areas - but here, like most people, I am taking things on trust. I have neither the time nor the interest to follow the detail of most government activity. I pick up impressions of general performance from casual reading, listening and viewing.</p> <p>Things get worse when it comes to local and European politics. Unlike most people, I vote in these elections, but I have no idea who my local councillors are, nor who is my MEP. I do not know what they are doing on my behalf. I assume that they are not going to do anything that will have much impact on me. Since my voting in these elections is founded on ignorance and indifference, it might be more honest not to vote at all. I vote because I recognise that some of us must in order to keep the mechanism ticking over.</p> <p>This is less true of national politics. As a Londoner, I am aware that the economy is doing fine, the schools are getting better and the Tube is not - all matters on which I attribute blame or credit to the Government. But you don't have to be an 'informed citizen' to do that. You can be completely disengaged and still make reasonably well-informed decisions about a government's competence.</p> <p>In the 1970s, some commentators began to think that Britain was 'ungovernable'. In the 1980s, Mrs Thatcher proved them wrong, but she also contributed to the developments which have led to us needing less from government than we used to. Paradoxically, we may now be more difficult to govern. We've learnt to expect the highest level of private-sector service from our public services and we become impatient when we are told that this depends on things outside government control.</p> <p>At the same time, we set much more store by the theatrical elements of politics - how politicians handle themselves. This showbiz aspect of politics is entertaining, but it is mediated almost exclusively through press and broadcasting organisations which are either partisan or proud of their critical independence.</p> <p>Political disengagement is a fact of life. We should stop worrying about it. It does not mean that we are becoming less public-spirited - indeed, people's readiness to devote significant time to charitable or voluntary activity is increasing.</p> <p>Disengagement does, however, make life more difficult for politicians. They could help themselves by raising fewer expectations which they cannot meet. New Labour knew this once, hence its five modest pledges in 1997. The pressures of government have blurred this insight. It would be as well for all of us if it could recover it.</p> <p>Barry Cox is deputy chairman of Channel 4</p> <p>This is an edited extract of an article in the August/September issue of Prospect magazine, published on 20 July. <a href=\"http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.prospect-magazine.co.uk</a> Subscriptions: 01454 620 070</p>",

We have yet to see what standing the new Scottish and Welsh representatives will earn, although the early signs are not good. After a few decades, MEPs have failed to increase their status among voters. Various explanations are given for this decline: ideology is dead and class allegiance less strong; the differences between parties are much less sharp; a lazy cynicism about politics and politicians pervades public debate. Reinforcing this disrespect for traditional politics is the decline in media coverage of serious political issues. The broadsheets have cut back parliamentary reporting and are almost as interested in the personal and the sensational as the tabloids. ITV has killed off News at Ten . The BBC is marginalising Panorama. Specialist political current affairs has disappeared from Channel 4. But this is not because the journalists and producers have become bored with politics - far from it. These developments took place because papers and TV organisations picked up the changing tastes of their readers and audiences - and over the past 20 years these have moved away from an interest in politics. In this sense, the media have responded to the 'crisis of disengagement' more effectively than the politicians. For the past 200 years, it has made sense to be politically active - in the first instance, to try to win the vote if you didn't have it, and thereafter to use it either to improve your lot or to defend what you had. In addition, you knew that the abilities of those elected to run the country could determine whether you would have to fight a war or watch the men in your family do so. Politics mattered. Now many people think it doesn't matter. And surely they are right. Today, it is reasonable for most of us in mainland Britain to assume that we are not going to be killed in a war. And Margaret Thatcher put an end to the idea that either national or local government would find you a job or a home. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have shown that Labour can run the economy as well as the Tories - so we are all technocrats now. And while it remains possible that different politicians with different policies will be more or less able to improve education, health provision and transport, it is not always easy to know enough about the the details of policy to enable you to decide how to vote on those issues. So voting has lost much of its direct link to many of the things which are most important to people. People's lives have become much fuller and richer. There is more to do, and more money to do it with. The time when going out to political meetings was a form of leisure activity is long past. For a minority of people, political values form an important part of their identity. Some people care sufficiently about particular issues such as the environment to become actively engaged. This kind of political activity is almost a lifestyle thing - not very different from deciding to be a vegetarian or a jogger. So why is political disengagement said to be a problem? People on the Left say that without the belief that life can be improved by political action the status quo will always prevail. Others argue that there is a more basic problem: if no one will stand up for liberal democracy, then extremists will start to win elections. But surely this would be self-correcting; in such circumstances, the majority would stir itself to vote its representatives back in. Alternatively, we could find that the range of people willing to take part in politics begins to narrow - our representatives would not be extremists but specialists, and thus unrepresentative in a different way. This is already happening. Westminster politics is becoming professionalised. MPs are increasingly drawn from people in the para-political professions - political PR people, advisers, researchers, think-tankers, journalists. It is possible to start your career in such a job, move into Parliament, then go back if you lose your seat. The new political professionals have another asset. They are generally well-equipped by their backgrounds to handle the day-to-day technicalities of legislation, they can master a wide range of issues to a respectable level, and can make reasonable assessments of the extent to which a lobbyist's case coincides with the wider public interest. We are unlikely to see the likes of Ernest Bevin - or even Margaret Thatcher - emerge from such a political class, but politics no longer requires such figures. This does not mean that we will be worse governed. As a broadcasting lobbyist for the past 13 years, I have seen a big improvement in the way governments and their officials have developed policy. I also know that in the same period the European Parliament has done an excellent job in scrutinising media policy. The process has been helped by the existence of a small number of specialist journalists able to report the industry's affairs intelligently. However, this high-level discourse is carried out by small \u00e9lites. Most of us don't know it is going on, and wouldn't much care if we did. I assume that similar processes have been at work in other areas - but here, like most people, I am taking things on trust. I have neither the time nor the interest to follow the detail of most government activity. I pick up impressions of general performance from casual reading, listening and viewing. Things get worse when it comes to local and European politics. Unlike most people, I vote in these elections, but I have no idea who my local councillors are, nor who is my MEP. I do not know what they are doing on my behalf. I assume that they are not going to do anything that will have much impact on me. Since my voting in these elections is founded on ignorance and indifference, it might be more honest not to vote at all. I vote because I recognise that some of us must in order to keep the mechanism ticking over. This is less true of national politics. As a Londoner, I am aware that the economy is doing fine, the schools are getting better and the Tube is not - all matters on which I attribute blame or credit to the Government. But you don't have to be an 'informed citizen' to do that. You can be completely disengaged and still make reasonably well-informed decisions about a government's competence. In the 1970s, some commentators began to think that Britain was 'ungovernable'. In the 1980s, Mrs Thatcher proved them wrong, but she also contributed to the developments which have led to us needing less from government than we used to. Paradoxically, we may now be more difficult to govern. We've learnt to expect the highest level of private-sector service from our public services and we become impatient when we are told that this depends on things outside government control. At the same time, we set much more store by the theatrical elements of politics - how politicians handle themselves. This showbiz aspect of politics is entertaining, but it is mediated almost exclusively through press and broadcasting organisations which are either partisan or proud of their critical independence. Political disengagement is a fact of life. We should stop worrying about it. It does not mean that we are becoming less public-spirited - indeed, people's readiness to devote significant time to charitable or voluntary activity is increasing. Disengagement does, however, make life more difficult for politicians. They could help themselves by raising fewer expectations which they cannot meet. New Labour knew this once, hence its five modest pledges in 1997. The pressures of government have blurred this insight. It would be as well for all of us if it could recover it.

      "body": "<p>I am obsessed by food. I can't help it. While other women shop for clothes or make-up, I browse in delicatessens. As soon as I walk in the door I sniff the air compulsively, anticipating a delectable forage along the shelves. I am at my happiest when I find an ingredient that opens up new culinary vistas. Perhaps a jar of Burmese prawn balachaung or some smoked Spanish paprika.</p> <p>The latter proved irresistible because of its tin. Striped orange and yellow, with a fat, yellow sun, La Chinata's Pimenton de la Vera, Extremadura, reminded me of the powder-paint pots of my childhood. It is, in fact, a traditional Spanish box perfectly designed to protect the paprika from light and damp.</p> <p>Once this is prised open with a blunt knife, you are assaulted by an intense, smoky smell. Who needs scented candles when you can recreate sultry Spanish nights in your kitchen by opening a tin - that evocative aroma of fried garlic, sweet peppers and woodsmoke?</p> <p>The very best Spanish paprika comes from Extremadura, a wild region famed for its long-legged, acorn-loving black pigs and conquistadors such as Cortez, Pizarro and de Soto. Perhaps it was such a direct link to the New World that led the astute monks from the monastery of Yuste in La Vera to introduce various hot and sweet thin-skinned peppers (Capsicum annuum) in the 16th century.</p> <p>These peppers are still grown on the alluvial soils of the river Tietar and are picked at the beginning of October. Elsewhere in Spain they are dried in the sun, but here they are suspended in long rows on the first floor of traditional mud houses. Oak fires are lit on the ground floor, so that the smoke and heat can gently permeate through the wooden floors and smoke the peppers. After 10 or 15 days, the dried peppers are seeded and slowly ground in stone mills.</p> <p>Naturally, such artisanship is protected by an EU Denominacion de Origin. As to cooking, experiment with Spanish recipes before adapting to your own style.

As soon as I walk in the door I sniff the air compulsively, anticipating a delectable forage along the shelves. I am at my happiest when I find an ingredient that opens up new culinary vistas. Perhaps a jar of Burmese prawn balachaung or some smoked Spanish paprika. The latter proved irresistible because of its tin. Striped orange and yellow, with a fat, yellow sun, La Chinata's Pimenton de la Vera, Extremadura, reminded me of the powder-paint pots of my childhood. It is, in fact, a traditional Spanish box perfectly designed to protect the paprika from light and damp. Once this is prised open with a blunt knife, you are assaulted by an intense, smoky smell. Who needs scented candles when you can recreate sultry Spanish nights in your kitchen by opening a tin - that evocative aroma of fried garlic, sweet peppers and woodsmoke? The very best Spanish paprika comes from Extremadura, a wild region famed for its long-legged, acorn-loving black pigs and conquistadors such as Cortez, Pizarro and de Soto. Perhaps it was such a direct link to the New World that led the astute monks from the monastery of Yuste in La Vera to introduce various hot and sweet thin-skinned peppers (Capsicum annuum) in the 16th century. These peppers are still grown on the alluvial soils of the river Tietar and are picked at the beginning of October. Elsewhere in Spain they are dried in the sun, but here they are suspended in long rows on the first floor of traditional mud houses. Oak fires are lit on the ground floor, so that the smoke and heat can gently permeate through the wooden floors and smoke the peppers. After 10 or 15 days, the dried peppers are seeded and slowly ground in stone mills. Naturally, such artisanship is protected by an EU Denominacion de Origin. As to cooking, experiment with Spanish recipes before adapting to your own style. A pinch of pimenton piquante (hot) is delicious in a tomato sauce or white-bean salad, while its dulce (sweet) cousin can be sprinkled on to sizzling garlic prawns or marinated anchovies.

      "body": "<p>Avril Barr has had a long battle to obtain life-saving surgery for her husband, John. First, she had to find doctors willing to perform the operation. Then she had to persuade her husband to go ahead.</p> <p>His reluctance is understandable. Ever since his kidneys failed - for no obvious reason - 10 years ago, John, 38, had been on renal dialysis, connected to a machine at home for up to six hours, three times a week. Although he was on the waiting list for a transplant, no suitable kidney turned up. So Avril, 40, wanted to give him one of hers.</p> <p>'I said, \"No way\" at first,' recalls John.</p> <p>'I was afraid of something going wrong - we have young kids.' The couple, who live in Carnoustie, Angus, have four children under 16. But dialysis was making the family's life a misery. John was limited to working part-time in his job as a bar steward and found even playing with the children in the park too strenuous.</p> <p>When Avril first mooted the operation, after hearing of living-donor transplants in the US, doctors at the local kidney unit in Dundee rejected the idea outright. But when John's care was transferred to Edinburgh last year, surgeons there agreed to go ahead - even though Avril's kidney was a poor match. The operation, last October, was a remarkable success.</p> <p>Now the Barrs are planning their first-ever holiday abroad, John is training for the transplant games this month and Avril has suffered no ill effects from losing one kidney. 'John has a lot more energy and plays much more with the kids,' says Avril. 'Financially we are better off because he can work full time.'</p> <p>Transplant experts now believe living-donor transplants hold a vital key to solving the growing crisis in organ shortages in Britain. As we approach National Transplant Week (starting on 24 July), there are more than 5,500 people on waiting lists for transplants - mostly for kidneys. But while the waiting list grows, transplants have declined in the past decade - partly because seat-belt laws have reduced fatal accidents, making fewer organs available after sudden deaths, but also because too few people carry donor cards.</p> <p>Meanwhile, living-donor transplants are rising steadily. Most are kidney operations, although a few involve transplanting segments of liver, lung or bowel and even the heart - in cases where a patient waiting for new lungs receives heart and lungs from a cadaver and donates their own healthy heart to another patient. Last year, there were 269 kidney transplants from living donors in the UK and Ireland, an eight per cent rise on the year before, representing a record 16 per cent of total kidney transplants in 1999.</p> <p>Although most donors are related, a growing number are not blood relatives, including husbands and wives, long-term partners and even close friends. Up to June last year, there had been 62 transplants from unrelated living donors in the UK.</p> <p>In the US, where living donors provide around 30 per cent of all transplants, a teacher recently gave a kidney to a pupil, while in Germany a surgeon has donated a kidney to a patient on his waiting list. In Norway, where more than 40 per cent of transplants are from living donors, it is said that almost everybody knows someone who has donated or received an organ in this way.</p> <p>'It is probably the future,' says a spokesperson for the National Kidney Research Fund. The risk to donors is small, it is not essential to find a perfect match and living transplants are more successful than those from cadavers, she explains. Although, initially, donors were confined to blood relatives, now organs are increasingly accepted from spouses, partners and friends. 'The boundaries are beginning to break down.'</p> <p>But although many transplant surgeons are keen to increase the number of living transplants, other doctors are cautious, worried that it is unethical to operate on healthy individuals and that relatives or friends may feel coerced into an operation. One American study found 6 per cent of donors had felt under pressure to give 'the gift of life'. While living transplants in Britain are rigorously regulated, transplant centres have to tread a fine line between doing everything possible for patients while not appearing to hector relatives.</p> <p>'We wait for offers,' says Professor Robert Sells, transplant surgeon at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, who is one of the pioneers of living kidney transplants in this country. While patients are told of the potential for live transplants, they are not encouraged to find donors, and doctors never ask family members, he says. If volunteers come forward, they undergo careful counselling with an independent professional before any tests to check whether a kidney is suitable. Currently, about 15 to 20 per cent of transplants at the unit involve living donors.</p> <p>Professor Sells is aware some doctors believe even this is too many. 'A lot of colleagues think of live donor transplants as the last option and have difficulty operating on a \"normal\" person,' he says. 'But given the benefits to be had by observing the wishes of the donor who really does want to go through with this act of generosity, it is probably a great privilege to do an operation of this sort.'</p> <p>Although the operation is a major one, the risks to the donor are 'minute' and living with one kidney is perfectly safe, he says. For the kidney patient, there is a better success rate with a live organ than with one from a cadaver, even with a poor match, because the operation is planned and the kidney is not stored for lengthy periods.</p> <p>He wants to encourage more living transplants, even from complete strangers who simply wish to donate a kidney to save a patient's life, perhaps in response to media appeals. 'I do think a lot of people would be willing to offer a kidney if they knew it was possible to donate one,' he says. 'I think I would accept anybody who is reasonably well motivated.'</p> <p>Other transplant centres also want to see more living transplants, but take a similarly cautious approach towards families. 'We try to encourage it, but we don't say, \"Go home and look for a donor,\"' says Pam Buckley, senior transplant co-ordinator at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. Last year, about 10 per cent of the 110 transplants at the unit involved live donors, and surgeons hope to double this figure in future. But staff make strenuous efforts to ensure potential donors are genuinely committed before going ahead to screening tests.</p> <p>'Once you have a blood test and are told you are a perfect match for say, your brother, the pressure is on,' she explains. Only one in three potential live transplants goes ahead, most faltering either for medical reasons or the donor pulling out, she says. The best tissue matches are between siblings. On average, one in four siblings offers a perfect match. But, even with a poor match, so long as blood groups are compatible, an operation may still go ahead. Powerful anti-rejection drugs help the patient accept the new kidney.</p> <p>Jacqueline Fraser, one of only a handful of counsellors specialising in renal care, based at Charing Cross Hospital, London, believes there is good reason to tread carefully when family members or friends offer kidneys. 'I don't think it makes any difference whether a donor is a blood relative, a relative by marriage or a friend,' she says. 'We have to accept there will be always be undercurrents.'</p> <p>Fraser says that patients often initially reject offers through guilt, but can become desperate after several years on dialysis. 'Every family is different,' she says. 'Sometimes it becomes apparent that the patient on dialysis is an absolute tyrant and that they are playing on the guilt their relative feels for being well.' If she feels concerned that the donor is not fully committed, she advises families to wait or alerts the surgeons, who will call the operation off, often citing medical reasons.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she is convinced that the vast majority of donors are totally altruistic. 'I believe most of the people I see are doing it purely for reasons of love.'</p> <p>Brian Bodell is an obvious example. He laughed at the suggestion that he needed counselling before donating one of his kidneys last August to son Ryan, now four. Born without kidneys, Ryan spent the first four months of his life in hospital before being allowed home, to spend two years on nightly dialysis. After complications developed, he had to fly three times a week to Liverpool for dialysis. Once Ryan was old enough for a live transplant, Brian and his wife, Caroline, had no hesitation. Brian's kidneys proved the best match.</p> <p>The operation went ahead in Manchester, with Brian's kidney removed at one hospital and dashed across the city to the children's hospital where Ryan waited. 'Ryan has so much energy now he is almost unrecognisable,' says Brian. 'It feels a little strange to know he is running around with a little piece of me inside him. But I would recommend it to anyone.'</p> <p><b>Giving life</b></p> <p>The first successful kidney transplant, in Boston in 1954, involved a living donor - one identical twin to another. Britain's kidney transplant programme, using organs from cadavers, was established in the 60s but, recently, the shortfall between the waiting list and available organs has grown. In future, cloning and xenotransplantation - using organs from animals - may solve the crisis. Meanwhile, the BMA has called for an 'opt-out' system, where anyone who dies suddenly is presumed to have consented to organ removal unless they have lodged an objection, and the Royal College of Surgeons wants to double living transplants. Since the 'kidneys for sale' scandal, when an international trade in kidneys was exposed, living transplants have been rigorously regulated. Under the Human Organ Transplants Act 1989, it is illegal to sell organs in the UK. If a relative wants to donate an organ, doctors must get genetic proof of the relationship. All transplants from non-blood relatives must be approved by the Unrelated Live Transplant Regulatory Authority (Ultra), to ensure there is no coercion or risk to the donor's health.</p> <p><b>Useful organisations</b></p> <p>To register as an organ donor, call 0845 6060 400.<br> <a href=\"http://www.nkrf.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">National Kidney Research Fund</a> 0845 300 1499<br> <a href=\"http://www.uktransplant.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">UK Transplant Support Service Authority</a> 0117 975 7575</p>",

'But given the benefits to be had by observing the wishes of the donor who really does want to go through with this act of generosity, it is probably a great privilege to do an operation of this sort.' Although the operation is a major one, the risks to the donor are 'minute' and living with one kidney is perfectly safe, he says. For the kidney patient, there is a better success rate with a live organ than with one from a cadaver, even with a poor match, because the operation is planned and the kidney is not stored for lengthy periods. He wants to encourage more living transplants, even from complete strangers who simply wish to donate a kidney to save a patient's life, perhaps in response to media appeals. 'I do think a lot of people would be willing to offer a kidney if they knew it was possible to donate one,' he says. 'I think I would accept anybody who is reasonably well motivated.' Other transplant centres also want to see more living transplants, but take a similarly cautious approach towards families. 'We try to encourage it, but we don't say, \"Go home and look for a donor,\"' says Pam Buckley, senior transplant co-ordinator at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. Last year, about 10 per cent of the 110 transplants at the unit involved live donors, and surgeons hope to double this figure in future. But staff make strenuous efforts to ensure potential donors are genuinely committed before going ahead to screening tests. 'Once you have a blood test and are told you are a perfect match for say, your brother, the pressure is on,' she explains. Only one in three potential live transplants goes ahead, most faltering either for medical reasons or the donor pulling out, she says. The best tissue matches are between siblings. On average, one in four siblings offers a perfect match. But, even with a poor match, so long as blood groups are compatible, an operation may still go ahead. Powerful anti-rejection drugs help the patient accept the new kidney. Jacqueline Fraser, one of only a handful of counsellors specialising in renal care, based at Charing Cross Hospital, London, believes there is good reason to tread carefully when family members or friends offer kidneys. 'I don't think it makes any difference whether a donor is a blood relative, a relative by marriage or a friend,' she says. 'We have to accept there will be always be undercurrents.' Fraser says that patients often initially reject offers through guilt, but can become desperate after several years on dialysis. 'Every family is different,' she says. 'Sometimes it becomes apparent that the patient on dialysis is an absolute tyrant and that they are playing on the guilt their relative feels for being well.' If she feels concerned that the donor is not fully committed, she advises families to wait or alerts the surgeons, who will call the operation off, often citing medical reasons. Nevertheless, she is convinced that the vast majority of donors are totally altruistic. 'I believe most of the people I see are doing it purely for reasons of love.' Brian Bodell is an obvious example. He laughed at the suggestion that he needed counselling before donating one of his kidneys last August to son Ryan, now four. Born without kidneys, Ryan spent the first four months of his life in hospital before being allowed home, to spend two years on nightly dialysis. After complications developed, he had to fly three times a week to Liverpool for dialysis. Once Ryan was old enough for a live transplant, Brian and his wife, Caroline, had no hesitation. Brian's kidneys proved the best match. The operation went ahead in Manchester, with Brian's kidney removed at one hospital and dashed across the city to the children's hospital where Ryan waited. 'Ryan has so much energy now he is almost unrecognisable,' says Brian. 'It feels a little strange to know he is running around with a little piece of me inside him. But I would recommend it to anyone.' Giving life The first successful kidney transplant, in Boston in 1954, involved a living donor - one identical twin to another. Britain's kidney transplant programme, using organs from cadavers, was established in the 60s but, recently, the shortfall between the waiting list and available organs has grown. In future, cloning and xenotransplantation - using organs from animals - may solve the crisis. Meanwhile, the BMA has called for an 'opt-out' system, where anyone who dies suddenly is presumed to have consented to organ removal unless they have lodged an objection, and the Royal College of Surgeons wants to double living transplants. Since the 'kidneys for sale' scandal, when an international trade in kidneys was exposed, living transplants have been rigorously regulated. Under the Human Organ Transplants Act 1989, it is illegal to sell organs in the UK. If a relative wants to donate an organ, doctors must get genetic proof of the relationship. All transplants from non-blood relatives must be approved by the Unrelated Live Transplant Regulatory Authority (Ultra), to ensure there is no coercion or risk to the donor's health.

      "body": "<p>New Labour may have decided that hunting is rather inappropriate in this day and age and should be stopped forthwith, but they have not had the nerve, yet, to ban angling. This may or may not have something to with the fact that, with 2.5 million active participants, it is one of the most popular sports in the UK.</p> <p>Angling, of course, divides into two camps: coarse fishing and fly-fishing. To the inexperienced eye, it appears that coarse fishing involves nothing more taxing than sitting on the bank of the canal, beneath an umbrella (perhaps with a beer or two for company), waiting for the alarm on your rods to signal a bite.</p> <p>To outfit yourself with a reasonable 'waggler' set-up, comprising float rod (\u00a390), reel (\u00a380), hooks, line, keep-net and tackle box, you're looking at about \u00a3250. You'll need a rod licence (\u00a319) and membership of a club: \u00a310 to \u00a330 per annum, although tickets for top carp fishing spots can be \u00a3500 per week. Such fish as bream, tench and roach need incentives to bite: a pint of maggots is \u00a32, and in a serious session you may use eight pints.

      "bodyText": "New Labour may have decided that hunting is rather inappropriate in this day and age and should be stopped forthwith, but they have not had the nerve, yet, to ban angling. This may or may not have something to with the fact that, with 2.5 million active participants, it is one of the most popular sports in the UK. Angling, of course, divides into two camps: coarse fishing and fly-fishing. To the inexperienced eye, it appears that coarse fishing involves nothing more taxing than sitting on the bank of the canal, beneath an umbrella (perhaps with a beer or two for company), waiting for the alarm on your rods to signal a bite. To outfit yourself with a reasonable 'waggler' set-up, comprising float rod (\u00a390), reel (\u00a380), hooks, line, keep-net and tackle box, you're looking at about \u00a3250. You'll need a rod licence (\u00a319) and membership of a club: \u00a310 to \u00a330 per annum, although tickets for top carp fishing spots can be \u00a3500 per week. Such fish as bream, tench and roach need incentives to bite: a pint of maggots is \u00a32, and in a serious session you may use eight pints. Match fishermen prefer carbon fibre poles, which are up to 14m long and don't have reels. These cost from \u00a3300 to \u00a33,000. Fly-fishing expenses are much higher, but you can at least eat your catch.

      "body": "<p>I'm standing outside the entrance to Corsham Primary School in Wiltshire. The deputy head is deadheading pansies in terracotta pots in preparation for the arrival of the Secretary of State for Education, while the head, Fiona Allen, is explaining to me how her two years working here have been preferable to her last job in London: 'I received a couple of quite serious death threats from parents when I was there,' she says, smiling. </p> <p>Behind us there is a small group of 10-year-old children fidgeting a little, looking out of the gate and up the road. They've been told that Mr Blunkett will arrive on a Harley- Davidson motorbike, and they have also been told that he can't see, so they don't know quite what to expect.</p> <p>As we wait, I'm reminded of a section of Blunkett's autobiography On A Clear Day in which a policeman, victim of an April fool's set-up, knocks on the MP's door in Sheffield to enquire, 'Do you drive a mini, sir?', when suddenly there is the roar of an engine, and the minister, in mirror shades and a black biker's helmet, pulls up, riding pillion on a metallic purple, chrome-studded machine, grinning broadly.</p> <p>The bike, he explains, posing for some pictures, belongs to the friend he has been staying with overnight; Blunkett has never been on a Harley before and he couldn't resist it. 'We're all such stuffed shirts most of the time,' he says, getting off and greeting the pupils, leaning up close, asking them about their SATs. 'You sound confident, Chris, I bet you didn't have any bother last week at all, did you?' The children, fascinated by this blind, besuited motorcyclist, with his gruff good humour and his dog, stare at him with a kind of wonderment.</p> <p>As he wanders the corridors, past a class in the gym doing music and movement, listening to the children's practised account of their school, Blunkett is a relaxed and patient presence. He uses his dog, Lucy, as an icebreaker, introducing her to everyone, asking her to locate classroom doors. With the children he adopts an exaggerated body language, putting his arms around their shoulders to make them feel at ease. 'Good to see you, Katie,' he says. 'Good to see you, Matthew.' And Katie and Matthew peer into his eyes, wondering if perhaps they've missed the point.</p> <p>Corsham seems a model school, the kind anyone would be proud to send their children to. It is full of light and colour; no square foot of wall-space lacks a painting or a poem or an extravagant collage. The Secretary of State is here partly to congratulate the school (and himself) on reducing its class sizes, but as we go from room to room, it becomes apparent that his pre-prepared press release (which oddly comes complete with quotes) is a little premature, and there are in fact 32 or 33 children in several of the classes. 'Still,' says Blunkett unabashed (he's very good at unabashed), 'we're getting there.'</p> <p>In one room he is introduced to children in yellow baseball caps, part of a buddy scheme to integrate new arrivals. ('How did you get your job?' Blunkett, also of course the Minister for Employment, enquires of one little boy. 'I polished my shoes,' he explains, in true New Deal fashion). And finally he sits down with a council of the school's children. Their questions sound suspiciously adult (unless 11-year-olds these days have become so indoctrinated with educationspeak that they really talk about 'Development and improvement programmes'.) But eventually someone pipes up with a more realistic query: 'Can we have an ice rink, Mr Blunkett?'</p> <p>'It would be nice,' says Blunkett in his careful, conspiratorial way, 'but I'm not sure that will make it into our next manifesto, and I'd better be careful because before I know it, I'll have made a pledge.'</p> <p>Before he goes, Blunkett offers his usual message of inspiration to the class: 'What I will ask myself when I am old and retired is, \"Did I make a difference?\" And that is what I would like you all to do also' He lets this idea sink in, and then he is off to make a difference back at an adult education conference in London, this time in his departmental car, on the way keeping up on his briefings on tape and in Braille.</p> <p>David Blunkett ought to be a national hero, but the reasons why he isn't, quite, are as compelling as the reasons why he almost is. When he first came to the attention of a wider public in the early 80s as leader of Sheffield council, he struck a captivating figure, common-sensical and stubbornly witty, quipping about his guide dog going to sleep on Question Time because of the dull politicking around him. </p> <p>Through the years, from Militant to New Labour, he has steered a moderate left-wing course, often binding his party together, consistently top of the polls in NEC elections. But since coming to power, Blunkett has seemed a more distant and a sterner figure. Apparently fiercely loyal to the Blair project - he never allows himself the merest hint of irony or disloyalty while discussing his leader or his cabinet colleagues - given the temper of the times, this is also compelling evidence of Blunkett's well-honed gift for political expediency. He has gained himself a reputation, too, for Gradgrinding teachers and pupils, churning out doctrine, and is often seen on the defensive - for instance, over his fudge on selection and his double speak on extra funding.</p> <p>One thing it has not been possible to fault him on in those three years, however, has been his devotion to duty. After seeing him in Corsham, I caught up with him again at the other end of the M4 later that morning. He was up on stage announcing a new \u00a320.25m package targeted at adult education, and offering anecdotes about how William Hague once ran away from school because he couldn't finish a jigsaw, before dishing out awards for adult enterprise to some former Liverpool dockers who have become IT entrepreneurs and travellers who have set up their own pre-school learning initiative. </p> <p>As the applause ended, he rushed off to exercise Lucy in the Commons garden, and then half an hour later he was back in his office, offering me tea and sandwiches - it was still only one o'clock. I'd read that Blunkett works harder than anyone in government, listening to briefing tapes at Pinky &amp; Perky speed, typing his own speeches on a Braille computer, but watching him up close you see how hardly a minute in his life can be wasted if he is to keep on top of things. You wonder if he can keep it up. You also wonder if perhaps he seems intent on making the teaching profession work as hard as he does. There was a story in the paper that morning about how 200,000 teachers have complained about the stress of their jobs to a new helpline in the last two years. I wondered, given his own schedule, how much sympathy he has.</p> <p>'I always said to myself I'd lay the foundation and someone else would see it bear fruit,' he suggests in his cautious-seeming manner. 'But when you are in the middle of it, you forget that and you get very hungry for change and improvement to happen very quickly.'</p> <p>Blunkett's empathy with the strains on teachers and, increasingly, on pupils, seems genuine enough - he goes on to say that his great failing in the job so far has been his inability to raise morale in the profession - but listening to him you have a strong sense that a part of him also gets a little impatient with the 'whingers'.</p> <p>And perhaps for good reason. Blunkett has never been a man afraid of getting on with life. As a teenager, he campaigned for the right to take O and A levels against the received wisdom of a liberal headmaster who did not believe that blind children would be well served by sitting exams - you did not need GCSEs to be a piano-tuner. Despite the fact that he knew nobody from his family or his estate who had gone on to higher education, Blunkett took night-school classes and day-release courses in order to apply to Sheffield University to study politics and education. Little surprise, then, that before he was made shadow education secretary by John Smith, his three sons threatened to write to the Labour leader in order to block the appointment on the grounds that their dad was 'already too keen on homework and discipline and would make their lives a misery'.</p> <p>Blunkett is at pains to describe himself as an education fundamentalist. He concedes that what he is set on achieving is a kind of personal crusade, but he stops short of suggesting that he sees his own experience as a model for anyone else. 'I don't like to simply say, \"I did it: aren't I wonderful.'' But I do like to suggest to kids that if I can do it, given that I was brought up in the same kind of community as you and that by the time I left school at 16 I'd got no qualifications at all, and furthermore that I couldn't see, then there's just a chance that you might be able to do it, too.'</p> <p>Looking back on his childhood, he sees his parents as the principal reason why he managed to overcome his considerable obstacles. For one thing, they always encouraged him to be independent, to think for himself, and never to accept his blindness as a handicap. 'My father was very influential,' he recalls. 'He had a breadth of knowledge and an understanding of current affairs which was phenomenal. He taught me the value of knowing things and not just learning them by rote. My mother taught me the importance of being able to read well; she had left school at 13 because of a heart complaint, but she taught herself and she read very widely, and she instilled in me the beauty and elegance of good writing.'</p> <p>Even those parental influences were restricted, however. At the age of four Blunkett was sent to a boarding school on the far side of Sheffield, the only option for a blind child at that time, where his mother and father were allowed to visit him only one Saturday a month. He recalls the school as a place where the boys were encouraged to ride bikes and play football; he notes how Braille had its advantages in that 'you could read under the covers after lights out'. But he remembers, too, that if you are a four-year-old left to fend for yourself, and particularly a blind four-year-old, you had no option but to 'develop a protective shell, and it becomes hard to define and express one's emotions to others - at least that's how it was for me'.</p> <p>If that experience steeled Blunkett to the world, his strength of character was tested further by the tragic death of his father, who he refers to in his autobiography as the 'the one playmate I could count on as a child'.</p> <p>Arthur Blunkett was killed after falling into a vat of boiling water while working at the Gas Board. He survived for a month with horrific burns and Blunkett, who was 12 at the time, still recalls the time of day - '3.34pm' - when his father died and how visiting him in hospital he was struck by 'the terrible smell of burnt flesh, which remains with me today'.</p> <p>And the nightmare did not end there: the Gas Board refused to pay compensation to his mother, Doris, because his father had been at retirement age; Doris Blunkett in difficult financial straits and trying to care for her son and fight for her late husband's rights, developed cancer soon after and a good part of Blunkett's teenage years were spent trying to support her.</p> <p>I wondered at what point he thought there might be a way out of that life, working as a clerk typist, trying to make ends meet. He said it was when a history teacher suggested to him that he might work towards going to university.</p> <p>'That was the eye-opener,' he says - he is fond of using metaphors to do with sight - 'at that moment I certainly saw what could be done. A great eye-opener, as I say.'</p> <p>Looking back now, I say, sitting here in his ministerial office, behind his enormous desk, with a small army of helpers bringing him notes, pouring him tea, that previous life must seem like it happened to someone else entirely.</p> <p>'Well,' he suggests, smiling a little, 'I'm very fortunate in that I still represent the area where I grew up, and people on the estate are friendly without being in the least bit impressed. They do say, \"I didn't think we'd see you around here any more,\" and that helps to remind you who you are. And they are robust when they don't agree with you. But they are welcoming; the kids still rush up to me in the street to yell, \"Hello, David.\" I love that. And certainly you don't get so much of it in London.'</p> <p>A fortnight later, I'm in Sheffield sitting in an advice bureau in Blunkett's constituency beside some of those people who help to remind him of who is. Gwen and Robert Blackett are in many ways an exemplary Sheffield couple and, like many around here, they could complain to their MP about several things. They could have a moan, for example, about the fact that these days Robert has to act as an unpaid security guard on the estate where they have lived for 40 years, moving on drunks and addicts from doorways and alleyways. Or they could tell their own version of Sheffield's ubiquitous Full Monty story: about how Robert was a works engineer in a local steel company until 'MacGregor arrived up here and shut all that life down', and how, as a result, Robert was forced to retrain as a nurse and get a job alongside his wife, who worked as an auxiliary at the Northern and General Hospital. And while they are on the subject, they could mention how, at their hospital, where between them they have put in 40-odd years of service, the old block that housed the Care for the Elderly unit is now full of junior Trust executives and that Matron used to run the wards better than any of them. </p> <p>But the Blacketts are realists, so instead they are to complain about a more local matter: they want the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to do something about the drain outside their house. It's been cleared only twice in four decades. 'I'm 63 now,' says Robert. 'And it's these little things that start to grate.'</p> <p>When the Blacketts put their problems to their MP, he responds first with his belly laugh. 'Do you know,' Blunkett says, facing intently towards the sound of the Blacketts' voices, '30 years ago when I was being questioned about being a candidate for the Labour council, I was asked, \"What would you do if somebody came to you complaining about a blocked drain?\" The sub-text was, I think, \"given that you can't see\". But I said, \"Well, I assume I wouldn't have to put my own arm down it\"'</p> <p>What Blunkett does do is dictate an immediate letter to the council's drains department full of phrases like: 'The need to take cognisance of the maintenance of the system as a whole' Wearing sandals with his blue suit, leaning back in his chair, he looks a little messianic, or at least lay-preacher, as he speaks into his Dictaphone. 'One day you have meetings with world leaders,' he says to me, 'and the next you're unblocking someone's U-bend. I'm not sure which I prefer.'</p> <p>Before they go, Blunkett, ever the politician, reminds his constituents of some of the things that the party has achieved in the neighbourhood: the revamped shopping area, the improving schools, and he sends them away convinced that something will be done about their own small problem. 'We're not very good at blowing our own trumpet,' he suggests, posing the unusual argument that New Labour is in fact all substance and no spin. 'It's like the Romans in Monty Python's Life of Brian. \"What has the Labour party ever done for us?\"'</p> <p>While Blunkett completes his surgery, I go for a drive around: past the Shire Green Working Men's Club where the The Full Monty was filmed, now, ironically, itself derelict and graffitied; round the troubled Flower Estate, where every other house is burned out or bordered up, and among whose problem families live the first three children to be excluded from Sheffield's city centre under Jack Straw's curfew initiative; through Meadowhall, where you can buy a decent three-bed semi for \u00a313,000, and finally into Parson Cross, which takes up most of Blunkett's constituency, the biggest housing estate in Europe. It was here, among the rows of faceless, interwar houses that the future cabinet minister grew up.</p> <p>When I return, Blunkett is chairing a meeting of Labour group councillors. They are discussing the problem of the Flower Estate and possibilities of getting funding for a health centre that might bring jobs to the area. There is talk of the Rebuild Programme and the Foyer Initiative - recycling is mentioned as one possible future. The Flower's newly appointed community worker reads out a letter from a residents' group and Blunkett nods sympathetically. Watching him with this small group of die-hard committee men, you see his politicking skills at work. He steers the argument briskly, jokes a little with old sparring partners, quietly playing on their foibles, and displays a consummate grasp of detail (Blunkett is famous in cabinet meetings for his memorised knowledge of facts and figures; while other ministers are still rifling through their papers, he has often already deconstructed the balance sheet and won the argument).</p> <p>What you notice, too, is his obsessive precision, almost pedantry, in never being caught out by his disability. When, for example, he gestures toward the Flower Estate you can see him carefully orienting himself, making absolutely sure he is pointing in the right direction, before giving a brief history of the area for my benefit. It is the predictable and sad tale of underfunding and lack of direction, of baths under the sink and outside lavatories, of particular families who make the rest of the locals' lives a misery: 'We need to look at these people who are causing all the problems. And we need to spread them around the city. But problems aren't solved by housing them - thereafter they need our attention and our support,' Blunkett intones.</p> <p>The council these days in Sheffield is Lib-Dem. This room of Old Labour men is full of complaints about how these days there is no 'opposition allowed in the council's cabinet'. 'At least in my day there was,' says Blunkett and then, remembering where he is now, laughing, 'Mind you, I'm not advocating cabinet opposition'</p> <p>When the meeting is concluded, he returns to his little office and sits down again to talk. In Sheffield, Blunkett is far more at home than in the more formal surroundings of his London department. He clearly relishes being among his 'own people' and - while never off-message - he speaks a little less guardedly about his life away from Westminster.</p> <p>In his book he repeatedly describes himself as a great romantic. He is a frustrated poet, penning slightly archaic verses about his political life ('Too oft I hear the echo reflected/from the wall that I myself have built/and fail to recognise the words/which bounce back in my face'). He writes, too, with some candour about his, for the most part, loveless marriage to Ruth, the mother of his boys, whom he met before he went to university: 'Over the course of time we accommodated each other in an almost platonic but stormy relationship which we survived for 17 years.'</p> <p>Since that relationship ended, Blunkett has not had a regular partner. I wonder if loneliness is a factor in his life these days. He laughs a little. 'I put great value on friendships,' he says. 'If you've got a friend you can phone any time, then you're never alone.'</p> <p>When I ask if his mind is closed to future relationships, he simply runs through his timetable: '16-hour days; often home from parliament at 10 or later, then two or three hours more work. I may be a romantic,' he says, 'but I am also a realist.'</p> <p>But wouldn't it be good to have someone to come home to?</p> <p>'Well, I suppose we all think that. I was once asked what most five-year-olds would wish for, given the chance, and I said: \"A hug when they get up in the morning and a hug when they go to bed at night.\"'</p> <p>So does he still feel a little like those five-year-olds?</p> <p>He smiles. 'I enjoy my friends,' he says. 'And I like to travel.'</p> <p>It is perhaps odd to think of Blunkett sightseeing, but apart from his annual trip to Majorca with his sons, he also relishes the prospect of foreign cities. The day after we meet, he is leading a delegation to China. </p> <p>'I only hope they let us out of the hotels and meeting rooms for a while,' he says. 'I like places where you can feel an atmosphere. I've been to New York only once, but I had a clear sense of the energy of the place, could imagine or feel the skyline. And, for example, in the Lake District I get this enormous sense of peace.'</p> <p>Does he feel he has a clear sense of things like colour?</p> <p>'Well, I know light and dark, though I have been known to get it wrong. And I think I have a close idea of how things look. But if you asked me what cream was, or purple, then obviously I couldn't be 100 per cent certain. I work by association. Purple, say, brings to mind a glass of red wine. I see it as that very rich taste. Still,' he adds, 'it's best not to think of that at this time of day. If there is a golden rule for a politician, it is no lunch-time drinking.'</p> <p>I wonder if he ever holds out hope, given the pace of medical advance, that one day his blindness might be cured.</p> <p>'Well,' he suggests, 'people born now with my condition might have some hope of a cure, but I hold out no hope for myself.'</p> <p>Does he ever suffer from depression when faced with that fact?</p> <p>'Well, from time to time I have black moods. But then,' he says, characteristically affirmative, 'you'd never get anything done.'</p> <p>What David Blunkett still might be able to get done is almost anyone's guess. When he talks of the future, he says he cannot see beyond education, but also that he feels he is coming to the end of what he can achieve. 'I'm very keen indeed to stay in this job until the general election, by which I'll have done at least four years. There comes a point when the Prime Minister wants fresh blood and you yourself feel you've done all you can. </p> <p>I don't feel that yet, but I might well do come the next election.'</p> <p>Some insiders suggest that he has ambitions to become Home Secretary. Certainly, with his mix of conservatism on social issues and instinctive radicalism, he would seem the obvious successor to Jack Straw, but there are also those who see no limits to what Blunkett might still achieve. A recent piece in the Daily Mail proposed the idea that he was Labour's Prime Minister-in-waiting. When I asked him about that, he played the classic Yorkshireman's straight bat and counted himself out with talk of 'workload' and 'personal denial'. These, of course, are qualities that he has never been short of. The first blind Prime Minister? Having come this far it would be a brave man who would bet against Blunkett going all the way.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I'm standing outside the entrance to Corsham Primary School in Wiltshire. The deputy head is deadheading pansies in terracotta pots in preparation for the arrival of the Secretary of State for Education, while the head, Fiona Allen, is explaining to me how her two years working here have been preferable to her last job in London: 'I received a couple of quite serious death threats from parents when I was there,' she says, smiling. Behind us there is a small group of 10-year-old children fidgeting a little, looking out of the gate and up the road. They've been told that Mr Blunkett will arrive on a Harley- Davidson motorbike, and they have also been told that he can't see, so they don't know quite what to expect. As we wait, I'm reminded of a section of Blunkett's autobiography On A Clear Day in which a policeman, victim of an April fool's set-up, knocks on the MP's door in Sheffield to enquire, 'Do you drive a mini, sir?', when suddenly there is the roar of an engine, and the minister, in mirror shades and a black biker's helmet, pulls up, riding pillion on a metallic purple, chrome-studded machine, grinning broadly. The bike, he explains, posing for some pictures, belongs to the friend he has been staying with overnight; Blunkett has never been on a Harley before and he couldn't resist it. 'We're all such stuffed shirts most of the time,' he says, getting off and greeting the pupils, leaning up close, asking them about their SATs. 'You sound confident, Chris, I bet you didn't have any bother last week at all, did you?' The children, fascinated by this blind, besuited motorcyclist, with his gruff good humour and his dog, stare at him with a kind of wonderment. As he wanders the corridors, past a class in the gym doing music and movement, listening to the children's practised account of their school, Blunkett is a relaxed and patient presence. He uses his dog, Lucy, as an icebreaker, introducing her to everyone, asking her to locate classroom doors. With the children he adopts an exaggerated body language, putting his arms around their shoulders to make them feel at ease. 'Good to see you, Katie,' he says. 'Good to see you, Matthew.' And Katie and Matthew peer into his eyes, wondering if perhaps they've missed the point. Corsham seems a model school, the kind anyone would be proud to send their children to. It is full of light and colour; no square foot of wall-space lacks a painting or a poem or an extravagant collage. The Secretary of State is here partly to congratulate the school (and himself) on reducing its class sizes, but as we go from room to room, it becomes apparent that his pre-prepared press release (which oddly comes complete with quotes) is a little premature, and there are in fact 32 or 33 children in several of the classes. 'Still,' says Blunkett unabashed (he's very good at unabashed), 'we're getting there.' In one room he is introduced to children in yellow baseball caps, part of a buddy scheme to integrate new arrivals. ('How did you get your job?' Blunkett, also of course the Minister for Employment, enquires of one little boy. 'I polished my shoes,' he explains, in true New Deal fashion). And finally he sits down with a council of the school's children. Their questions sound suspiciously adult (unless 11-year-olds these days have become so indoctrinated with educationspeak that they really talk about 'Development and improvement programmes'.) But eventually someone pipes up with a more realistic query: 'Can we have an ice rink, Mr Blunkett?' 'It would be nice,' says Blunkett in his careful, conspiratorial way, 'but I'm not sure that will make it into our next manifesto, and I'd better be careful because before I know it, I'll have made a pledge.' Before he goes, Blunkett offers his usual message of inspiration to the class: 'What I will ask myself when I am old and retired is, \"Did I make a difference?\" And that is what I would like you all to do also' He lets this idea sink in, and then he is off to make a difference back at an adult education conference in London, this time in his departmental car, on the way keeping up on his briefings on tape and in Braille. David Blunkett ought to be a national hero, but the reasons why he isn't, quite, are as compelling as the reasons why he almost is. When he first came to the attention of a wider public in the early 80s as leader of Sheffield council, he struck a captivating figure, common-sensical and stubbornly witty, quipping about his guide dog going to sleep on Question Time because of the dull politicking around him. Through the years, from Militant to New Labour, he has steered a moderate left-wing course, often binding his party together, consistently top of the polls in NEC elections. But since coming to power, Blunkett has seemed a more distant and a sterner figure. Apparently fiercely loyal to the Blair project - he never allows himself the merest hint of irony or disloyalty while discussing his leader or his cabinet colleagues - given the temper of the times, this is also compelling evidence of Blunkett's well-honed gift for political expediency. He has gained himself a reputation, too, for Gradgrinding teachers and pupils, churning out doctrine, and is often seen on the defensive - for instance, over his fudge on selection and his double speak on extra funding. One thing it has not been possible to fault him on in those three years, however, has been his devotion to duty. After seeing him in Corsham, I caught up with him again at the other end of the M4 later that morning. He was up on stage announcing a new \u00a320.25m package targeted at adult education, and offering anecdotes about how William Hague once ran away from school because he couldn't finish a jigsaw, before dishing out awards for adult enterprise to some former Liverpool dockers who have become IT entrepreneurs and travellers who have set up their own pre-school learning initiative. As the applause ended, he rushed off to exercise Lucy in the Commons garden, and then half an hour later he was back in his office, offering me tea and sandwiches - it was still only one o'clock. I'd read that Blunkett works harder than anyone in government, listening to briefing tapes at Pinky &amp; Perky speed, typing his own speeches on a Braille computer, but watching him up close you see how hardly a minute in his life can be wasted if he is to keep on top of things. You wonder if he can keep it up. You also wonder if perhaps he seems intent on making the teaching profession work as hard as he does. There was a story in the paper that morning about how 200,000 teachers have complained about the stress of their jobs to a new helpline in the last two years. I wondered, given his own schedule, how much sympathy he has. 'I always said to myself I'd lay the foundation and someone else would see it bear fruit,' he suggests in his cautious-seeming manner. 'But when you are in the middle of it, you forget that and you get very hungry for change and improvement to happen very quickly.' Blunkett's empathy with the strains on teachers and, increasingly, on pupils, seems genuine enough - he goes on to say that his great failing in the job so far has been his inability to raise morale in the profession - but listening to him you have a strong sense that a part of him also gets a little impatient with the 'whingers'. And perhaps for good reason. Blunkett has never been a man afraid of getting on with life. As a teenager, he campaigned for the right to take O and A levels against the received wisdom of a liberal headmaster who did not believe that blind children would be well served by sitting exams - you did not need GCSEs to be a piano-tuner. Despite the fact that he knew nobody from his family or his estate who had gone on to higher education, Blunkett took night-school classes and day-release courses in order to apply to Sheffield University to study politics and education. Little surprise, then, that before he was made shadow education secretary by John Smith, his three sons threatened to write to the Labour leader in order to block the appointment on the grounds that their dad was 'already too keen on homework and discipline and would make their lives a misery'. Blunkett is at pains to describe himself as an education fundamentalist. He concedes that what he is set on achieving is a kind of personal crusade, but he stops short of suggesting that he sees his own experience as a model for anyone else. 'I don't like to simply say, \"I did it: aren't I wonderful.'' But I do like to suggest to kids that if I can do it, given that I was brought up in the same kind of community as you and that by the time I left school at 16 I'd got no qualifications at all, and furthermore that I couldn't see, then there's just a chance that you might be able to do it, too.' Looking back on his childhood, he sees his parents as the principal reason why he managed to overcome his considerable obstacles. For one thing, they always encouraged him to be independent, to think for himself, and never to accept his blindness as a handicap. 'My father was very influential,' he recalls. 'He had a breadth of knowledge and an understanding of current affairs which was phenomenal. He taught me the value of knowing things and not just learning them by rote. My mother taught me the importance of being able to read well; she had left school at 13 because of a heart complaint, but she taught herself and she read very widely, and she instilled in me the beauty and elegance of good writing.' Even those parental influences were restricted, however. At the age of four Blunkett was sent to a boarding school on the far side of Sheffield, the only option for a blind child at that time, where his mother and father were allowed to visit him only one Saturday a month. He recalls the school as a place where the boys were encouraged to ride bikes and play football; he notes how Braille had its advantages in that 'you could read under the covers after lights out'. But he remembers, too, that if you are a four-year-old left to fend for yourself, and particularly a blind four-year-old, you had no option but to 'develop a protective shell, and it becomes hard to define and express one's emotions to others - at least that's how it was for me'. If that experience steeled Blunkett to the world, his strength of character was tested further by the tragic death of his father, who he refers to in his autobiography as the 'the one playmate I could count on as a child'. Arthur Blunkett was killed after falling into a vat of boiling water while working at the Gas Board. He survived for a month with horrific burns and Blunkett, who was 12 at the time, still recalls the time of day - '3.34pm' - when his father died and how visiting him in hospital he was struck by 'the terrible smell of burnt flesh, which remains with me today'. And the nightmare did not end there: the Gas Board refused to pay compensation to his mother, Doris, because his father had been at retirement age; Doris Blunkett in difficult financial straits and trying to care for her son and fight for her late husband's rights, developed cancer soon after and a good part of Blunkett's teenage years were spent trying to support her. I wondered at what point he thought there might be a way out of that life, working as a clerk typist, trying to make ends meet. He said it was when a history teacher suggested to him that he might work towards going to university. 'That was the eye-opener,' he says - he is fond of using metaphors to do with sight - 'at that moment I certainly saw what could be done. A great eye-opener, as I say.' Looking back now, I say, sitting here in his ministerial office, behind his enormous desk, with a small army of helpers bringing him notes, pouring him tea, that previous life must seem like it happened to someone else entirely. 'Well,' he suggests, smiling a little, 'I'm very fortunate in that I still represent the area where I grew up, and people on the estate are friendly without being in the least bit impressed. They do say, \"I didn't think we'd see you around here any more,\" and that helps to remind you who you are. And they are robust when they don't agree with you. But they are welcoming; the kids still rush up to me in the street to yell, \"Hello, David.\" I love that. And certainly you don't get so much of it in London.'

The council these days in Sheffield is Lib-Dem. This room of Old Labour men is full of complaints about how these days there is no 'opposition allowed in the council's cabinet'. 'At least in my day there was,' says Blunkett and then, remembering where he is now, laughing, 'Mind you, I'm not advocating cabinet opposition' When the meeting is concluded, he returns to his little office and sits down again to talk. In Sheffield, Blunkett is far more at home than in the more formal surroundings of his London department. He clearly relishes being among his 'own people' and - while never off-message - he speaks a little less guardedly about his life away from Westminster. In his book he repeatedly describes himself as a great romantic. He is a frustrated poet, penning slightly archaic verses about his political life ('Too oft I hear the echo reflected/from the wall that I myself have built/and fail to recognise the words/which bounce back in my face'). He writes, too, with some candour about his, for the most part, loveless marriage to Ruth, the mother of his boys, whom he met before he went to university: 'Over the course of time we accommodated each other in an almost platonic but stormy relationship which we survived for 17 years.' Since that relationship ended, Blunkett has not had a regular partner. I wonder if loneliness is a factor in his life these days. He laughs a little. 'I put great value on friendships,' he says. 'If you've got a friend you can phone any time, then you're never alone.' When I ask if his mind is closed to future relationships, he simply runs through his timetable: '16-hour days; often home from parliament at 10 or later, then two or three hours more work. I may be a romantic,' he says, 'but I am also a realist.' But wouldn't it be good to have someone to come home to? 'Well, I suppose we all think that. I was once asked what most five-year-olds would wish for, given the chance, and I said: \"A hug when they get up in the morning and a hug when they go to bed at night.\"' So does he still feel a little like those five-year-olds? He smiles. 'I enjoy my friends,' he says. 'And I like to travel.' It is perhaps odd to think of Blunkett sightseeing, but apart from his annual trip to Majorca with his sons, he also relishes the prospect of foreign cities. The day after we meet, he is leading a delegation to China. 'I only hope they let us out of the hotels and meeting rooms for a while,' he says. 'I like places where you can feel an atmosphere. I've been to New York only once, but I had a clear sense of the energy of the place, could imagine or feel the skyline. And, for example, in the Lake District I get this enormous sense of peace.' Does he feel he has a clear sense of things like colour? 'Well, I know light and dark, though I have been known to get it wrong. And I think I have a close idea of how things look. But if you asked me what cream was, or purple, then obviously I couldn't be 100 per cent certain. I work by association. Purple, say, brings to mind a glass of red wine. I see it as that very rich taste. Still,' he adds, 'it's best not to think of that at this time of day. If there is a golden rule for a politician, it is no lunch-time drinking.' I wonder if he ever holds out hope, given the pace of medical advance, that one day his blindness might be cured. 'Well,' he suggests, 'people born now with my condition might have some hope of a cure, but I hold out no hope for myself.' Does he ever suffer from depression when faced with that fact? 'Well, from time to time I have black moods. But then,' he says, characteristically affirmative, 'you'd never get anything done.' What David Blunkett still might be able to get done is almost anyone's guess. When he talks of the future, he says he cannot see beyond education, but also that he feels he is coming to the end of what he can achieve. 'I'm very keen indeed to stay in this job until the general election, by which I'll have done at least four years. There comes a point when the Prime Minister wants fresh blood and you yourself feel you've done all you can. I don't feel that yet, but I might well do come the next election.' Some insiders suggest that he has ambitions to become Home Secretary. Certainly, with his mix of conservatism on social issues and instinctive radicalism, he would seem the obvious successor to Jack Straw, but there are also those who see no limits to what Blunkett might still achieve. A recent piece in the Daily Mail proposed the idea that he was Labour's Prime Minister-in-waiting. When I asked him about that, he played the classic Yorkshireman's straight bat and counted himself out with talk of 'workload' and 'personal denial'. These, of course, are qualities that he has never been short of. The first blind Prime Minister? Having come this far it would be a brave man who would bet against Blunkett going all the way.",

      "body": "<p>The end of the day is the perfect time to sit down and relax over a good meal. Not only can supper be a sociable occasion, but in physiological terms it also enables your body to replenish its nutrient reserves to ensure that you will feel well and full of energy the next morning. The long working hours, family and other pressures that are part and parcel of modern life mean that many people don't have time to have supper until the early hours of the evening - few of us today manage to sit down to eat at 5.30pm, which was once the usual time for supper. Eating late is not a problem in itself, though; contrary to popular belief, the body's metabolic rate does not slow down overnight, so you're no more likely to put on weight if you eat later rather than earlier. The disadvantages of eating late have more to do with other physiological reactions, as well as the way in which the gut is treated. When they finally have time for supper, people who don't eat until late are often too hungry to make the best nutritional choices for their bodies. They are far more likely to grab anything that is edible from the fridge, reach for some crisps or pick up a kebab or pizza on the way home from work. Even if they manage to hold out until they are in the kitchen, they rarely have the patience and willpower to start chopping up vegetables or to make a sauce from scratch. </p> <p>There are two main problems associated with eating late and inappropriately. First, if you pick at your food, eat it really quickly, or buy fast food on the way home, the foods that you have chosen will probably not be very healthy, and are more likely to contain high levels of fat and sugar and low levels of beneficial nutrients. Because they are hard for your body to digest, your gut will become irritated if you eat such foods often (especially if you eat a number of them at once and bolt them down quickly), and you will end up feeling as though you have a leaden stomach and/or will suffer from indigestion or bloating. Consuming foods that are difficult to digest late in the evening can furthermore disrupt your sleeping patterns, with the result that you will feel sluggish in the morning. </p> <p>Secondly, your body will be deprived of the opportunity to restock its nutrient reserves. After all, your daily activities will have depleted its store of vitamins and minerals and will have exhausted its glycogen supplies (the major body-fuel reserve that is stored in the liver and muscles), while moving around will have used up the muscle-bound amino acids (protein 'building blocks'). If you don't replenish these reserves, you will expose your body to short-term health problems, such as a weakened immune system, a tendency to catch colds easily and lack of energy, while cancer and heart disease may rear their ugly heads in the future. </p> <p>Eating well in the evening isn't difficult once you know what your body needs, as well as how to quickly combine foods that contain beneficial nutrients. Having a snack in the middle of the afternoon or eating a piece of fruit before you leave the office or collect your children from school will help to stave off feelings of hunger until supper, by which time you will still feel strong enough - both physically and mentally - to transform nutritious supper ingredients into a tasty and nourishing meal. </p> <p>The most relaxing nutrient to eat in the evening is starch, which is contained in bread, rice, polenta, couscous, pasta and potatoes, among other types of food. Such starchy foods encourage your body to produce sleep-inducing hormones - perfect at the end of a stressful day - and also play an important part in replenishing your body's glycogen reserves. You should ideally serve vegetables, a salad or fruit (which provide your body with vitamins and minerals) with starchy dishes like my tomato, goat's cheese and broad bean risotto. </p> <p>Delicious as they are, if you eat rice or pasta every evening, you will soon become bored with them and will start to crave different, and not necessarily nutritious, types of food. So make sure that you vary your suppers, alternating starchy meals with such protein-rich dishes as my spicy cod, cabbage leaves stuffed with spicy lamb or lentil casserole. I have kept the protein sources in all of my supper dishes lean, so you can add extra flavour with a little olive oil or butter if you want to without having to worry about your weight. Remember, too, that your evening meal doesn't have to be a large one, but could be a bowl of, say, chicken soup with dim sum or carpaccio with a little salad (buy a ready-prepared green, leafy salad and chop some tomatoes into it for a really simple side dish). </p> <p>Alternatively, you could rustle up one of my lunch or breakfast dishes for supper, if you fancy it. Even if you're late home from work and don't really feel like eating, the important thing is to eat a little something in the evening - you'll feel much healthier for it the next day.</p> <p><strong>Recipes</strong></p> <p><strong>Tomato, goat's cheese and broad bean risotto</strong> <br>Serves 2<br><strong> Magic ingredient </strong>rice</p> <p>The rice in this wheat-free, carbohydrate-rich recipe helps to induce feelings of sleepiness, making it a delicious and sustaining dish to enjoy in the evening in anticipation of a good night's sleep.</p> <p><strong>1 tbsp olive oil <br> 50g shallots, finely chopped<br> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped<br> 350g risotto rice<br> 1.5 litres fresh chicken or vegetable<br> stock, warmed<br> 100ml dry white wine<br> 25g butter<br> 175g frozen broad beans, defrosted<br> 110g creamy goat's cheese, crumbled<br> 110g sun-dried tomatoes<br> 50g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated<br> salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Place the olive oil in a large saucepan and warm it over a gentle heat. Add the shallots and garlic. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shallots have softened and have started to become clear. Add the risotto rice and stir well to heat all of the grains. Bring the stock to boil in another saucepan and then gradually add it to the rice a cup at a time, stirring well, until the rice has absorbed each cupful and is tender, but still al dente (it shouldn't be mushy). Pour in the wine. Turn off the heat and add the butter, broad beans, goat's cheese, tomatoes and Parmesan cheese. Season to taste, using lots of freshly ground black pepper. Serve at once.</p> <p><strong>Berries with mascarpone cheese<br> </strong>Serves 6<br><strong> Magic ingredient</strong> mascarpone</p> <p>The mascarpone cheese in this dish is rich in vitamin D, a nutrient that plays an essential role in assisting calcium to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D in the body is mainly generated by sunlight, so this dessert will help to top up your intake if you haven't been outside lately.</p> <p><strong>450g raspberries <br> 225g blueberries<br> 900g strawberries, hulled and cut in half, lengthwise<br> 225g mascarpone cheese<br> 170ml natural yogurt<br> 75g icing sugar</strong></p> <p>Set half of the raspberries to one side. Combine the remaining raspberries, blueberries and strawberries in a large mixing bowl. Mix the mascarpone cheese and yogurt in a small mixing bowl until smooth. In a blender, pur\u00e9e the reserved raspberries with the icing sugar until the berries are smooth and the sugar has dissolved. To serve, place a little raspberry sauce on to each plate and arrange a pile of berries in the centre. Top with a dollop of the mascarpone mixture.</p> <p><strong>Baby vegetables with a lime and walnut dressing </strong><br>Serves 4<br><strong><br> Magic ingredient </strong>walnut oil</p> <p>This recipe is featured in the lunch section of my book, but I also think it makes a good light supper dish - either eaten on its own or as a side dish. Walnut oil contains high levels of vitamin E, which plays an important role in reducing the incidence of heart disease. For best results, steam the vegetables in a steamer which has two or three levels.</p> <p>Dressing</p> <p><strong>6 tbsp walnut oil<br> 1/2 tsp white truffle or sesame oil<br> 1 tbsp honey<br> 2 tbsp lime juice <br> salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Baby vegetables</p> <p><strong>225g whole baby (new) potatoes, cleaned<br> 225g baby carrots, cleaned<br> 110g whole baby parsnips, cleaned<br> 225g baby courgettes, flowers attached<br> 225g runner beans, topped and tailed<br> 110g whole baby leeks, cleaned<br> 110g broad beans</strong></p> <p>Make the vegetable dressing by mixing all of the dressing ingredients together (an easy way to do this is to shake them together in a screw-topped jar). Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the potatoes to the water. When the potatoes have been boiling for 6 minutes, place a Chinese steamer over them and pop the carrots and parsnips into the bottom level, nearest the steam. After 2 more minutes, add the courgettes to the carrots and parsnips. Place the remaining vegetables in the top level of the steamer. Cook for a further 3 to 5 minutes, until all of the vegetables are cooked. Note that a colander placed over a large pan of water with a saucepan lid on top will also work as a steamer. Place the vegetables on a serving plate and drizzle the dressing over the top, to taste.</p> <p><strong>Insomnia</strong></p> <p>You may find the following nutritional tips helpful if you have trouble sleeping.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have supper late, try not to eat too much, because excess food-induced indigestion can make you feel uncomfortable and far from sleepy.</p> <p>\u0095 Starchy foods, such as pasta, mashed potatoes and risotto, encourage your body to produce sleep-inducing hormones, so try to base your evening meals around these ingredients.</p> <p>\u0095 Drink camomile (one of the most potent floral remedies for disturbed sleeping patterns) or mint tea at night, rather than caffeine-containing drinks like tea, coffee, hot chocolate and cola-based beverages, and try not to drink such caffeine-rich drinks after midday. Because it stimulates the brain, caffeine adversely affects your ability to sleep well. The ancient Greeks used dill seeds (you will find these in health-food shops and supermarkets) to promote sleep; try infusing them in water.</p> <p>\u0095 Although a little alcohol can relax you, too much will disrupt your body's sleeping patterns - you may sleep for longer but will wake up feeling far from refreshed. Excess alcohol can disrupt your sleep by causing dehydration and drops in blood-sugar level. So stick to drinking a sensible amount of alcohol, and only when your stomach is full.</p> <p>\u0095 Avoid taking vitamin and mineral supplements at night (unless your doctor advises you otherwise) - some supplements stimulate brain activity and prevent you from sleeping well.</p> <p>\u0095 Add a few drops of sleep-promoting herbal and floral essential oils such as basil, camomile and lavender to your bath - they will relax you wonderfully.</p> <p>\u0095 Try to reduce your stress levels. Exercise often and explore other stress-relieving activities.</p> <p><strong>Noodles with red peppers, chicken and cashew nuts</strong> <br> Serves 4<br><strong> Magic ingredient</strong> red peppers</p> <p>Even though the magic ingredient is red peppers - rich in betacarotene, an antioxidant that the body converts into vitamin A, which helps to reduce the incidence of cancer, as well as promoting growth, good vision and healthy skin - combining them with the starch-rich noodles (which encourage the production of sleepy hormones) makes this a perfect healthy, soporific supper.</p> <p><strong>dash of olive oil <br> 4 red peppers, cored, de-seeded and chopped<br> into quarters<br> 8 shallots, peeled and halved<br> 3 cloves garlic, peeled but left whole<br> 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves<br> 1 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, chopped<br> 3 chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips<br> 1 tsp olive oil<br> 350g dried noodles<br> 50g cashew nuts<br> salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F/gas mark 6. Brush a roasting tin with a little olive oil. Arrange the peppers, shallots and garlic in the tin and sprinkle with the thyme and rosemary leaves. Bake for 10 minutes. Add the chicken and bake for a further 10 minutes, basting the vegetables occasionally. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and add the salt, olive oil and noodles. Boil for 10 minutes, or until the noodles are al dente. When the chicken is cooked and the vegetables soft and brown around the edges, remove them from the roasting tin. Drain the noodles and combine them with the chicken mixture. Stir in the cashew nuts and season with salt and pepper.</p> <p><strong>Lowering high-cholesterol levels</strong></p> <p>If your cholesterol level is high, it is vital that you watch what you eat. The following nutritional tips will help you to maintain a healthy cholesterol level.</p> <p>\u0095 Eat lots of the foods that produce high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good' cholesterol, such as oily fish, garlic, wholegrains, fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>\u0095 Drink 2 to 3 litres of water a day. Water encourages the fibre in food to swell and stimulates the liver to produce HDL, which carries low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or 'bad' cholesterol, to the gut, from which it is excreted.</p> <p>\u0095 Don't eat too many saturated animal fats.

      "bodyText": "The end of the day is the perfect time to sit down and relax over a good meal. Not only can supper be a sociable occasion, but in physiological terms it also enables your body to replenish its nutrient reserves to ensure that you will feel well and full of energy the next morning. The long working hours, family and other pressures that are part and parcel of modern life mean that many people don't have time to have supper until the early hours of the evening - few of us today manage to sit down to eat at 5.30pm, which was once the usual time for supper. Eating late is not a problem in itself, though; contrary to popular belief, the body's metabolic rate does not slow down overnight, so you're no more likely to put on weight if you eat later rather than earlier. The disadvantages of eating late have more to do with other physiological reactions, as well as the way in which the gut is treated. When they finally have time for supper, people who don't eat until late are often too hungry to make the best nutritional choices for their bodies. They are far more likely to grab anything that is edible from the fridge, reach for some crisps or pick up a kebab or pizza on the way home from work. Even if they manage to hold out until they are in the kitchen, they rarely have the patience and willpower to start chopping up vegetables or to make a sauce from scratch. There are two main problems associated with eating late and inappropriately. First, if you pick at your food, eat it really quickly, or buy fast food on the way home, the foods that you have chosen will probably not be very healthy, and are more likely to contain high levels of fat and sugar and low levels of beneficial nutrients. Because they are hard for your body to digest, your gut will become irritated if you eat such foods often (especially if you eat a number of them at once and bolt them down quickly), and you will end up feeling as though you have a leaden stomach and/or will suffer from indigestion or bloating. Consuming foods that are difficult to digest late in the evening can furthermore disrupt your sleeping patterns, with the result that you will feel sluggish in the morning. Secondly, your body will be deprived of the opportunity to restock its nutrient reserves. After all, your daily activities will have depleted its store of vitamins and minerals and will have exhausted its glycogen supplies (the major body-fuel reserve that is stored in the liver and muscles), while moving around will have used up the muscle-bound amino acids (protein 'building blocks'). If you don't replenish these reserves, you will expose your body to short-term health problems, such as a weakened immune system, a tendency to catch colds easily and lack of energy, while cancer and heart disease may rear their ugly heads in the future. Eating well in the evening isn't difficult once you know what your body needs, as well as how to quickly combine foods that contain beneficial nutrients. Having a snack in the middle of the afternoon or eating a piece of fruit before you leave the office or collect your children from school will help to stave off feelings of hunger until supper, by which time you will still feel strong enough - both physically and mentally - to transform nutritious supper ingredients into a tasty and nourishing meal. The most relaxing nutrient to eat in the evening is starch, which is contained in bread, rice, polenta, couscous, pasta and potatoes, among other types of food. Such starchy foods encourage your body to produce sleep-inducing hormones - perfect at the end of a stressful day - and also play an important part in replenishing your body's glycogen reserves. You should ideally serve vegetables, a salad or fruit (which provide your body with vitamins and minerals) with starchy dishes like my tomato, goat's cheese and broad bean risotto. Delicious as they are, if you eat rice or pasta every evening, you will soon become bored with them and will start to crave different, and not necessarily nutritious, types of food. So make sure that you vary your suppers, alternating starchy meals with such protein-rich dishes as my spicy cod, cabbage leaves stuffed with spicy lamb or lentil casserole. I have kept the protein sources in all of my supper dishes lean, so you can add extra flavour with a little olive oil or butter if you want to without having to worry about your weight. Remember, too, that your evening meal doesn't have to be a large one, but could be a bowl of, say, chicken soup with dim sum or carpaccio with a little salad (buy a ready-prepared green, leafy salad and chop some tomatoes into it for a really simple side dish). Alternatively, you could rustle up one of my lunch or breakfast dishes for supper, if you fancy it. Even if you're late home from work and don't really feel like eating, the important thing is to eat a little something in the evening - you'll feel much healthier for it the next day. Recipes Tomato, goat's cheese and broad bean risotto Serves 2 Magic ingredient rice The rice in this wheat-free, carbohydrate-rich recipe helps to induce feelings of sleepiness, making it a delicious and sustaining dish to enjoy in the evening in anticipation of a good night's sleep. 1 tbsp olive oil 50g shallots, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 350g risotto rice 1.5 litres fresh chicken or vegetable stock, warmed 100ml dry white wine 25g butter 175g frozen broad beans, defrosted 110g creamy goat's cheese, crumbled 110g sun-dried tomatoes 50g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated salt and freshly ground black pepper Place the olive oil in a large saucepan and warm it over a gentle heat. Add the shallots and garlic. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shallots have softened and have started to become clear. Add the risotto rice and stir well to heat all of the grains. Bring the stock to boil in another saucepan and then gradually add it to the rice a cup at a time, stirring well, until the rice has absorbed each cupful and is tender, but still al dente (it shouldn't be mushy). Pour in the wine. Turn off the heat and add the butter, broad beans, goat's cheese, tomatoes and Parmesan cheese. Season to taste, using lots of freshly ground black pepper. Serve at once. Berries with mascarpone cheese Serves 6 Magic ingredient mascarpone The mascarpone cheese in this dish is rich in vitamin D, a nutrient that plays an essential role in assisting calcium to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D in the body is mainly generated by sunlight, so this dessert will help to top up your intake if you haven't been outside lately. 450g raspberries 225g blueberries 900g strawberries, hulled and cut in half, lengthwise 225g mascarpone cheese 170ml natural yogurt 75g icing sugar Set half of the raspberries to one side. Combine the remaining raspberries, blueberries and strawberries in a large mixing bowl. Mix the mascarpone cheese and yogurt in a small mixing bowl until smooth. In a blender, pur\u00e9e the reserved raspberries with the icing sugar until the berries are smooth and the sugar has dissolved. To serve, place a little raspberry sauce on to each plate and arrange a pile of berries in the centre. Top with a dollop of the mascarpone mixture. Baby vegetables with a lime and walnut dressing Serves 4 Magic ingredient walnut oil This recipe is featured in the lunch section of my book, but I also think it makes a good light supper dish - either eaten on its own or as a side dish. Walnut oil contains high levels of vitamin E, which plays an important role in reducing the incidence of heart disease. For best results, steam the vegetables in a steamer which has two or three levels. Dressing 6 tbsp walnut oil 1/2 tsp white truffle or sesame oil 1 tbsp honey 2 tbsp lime juice salt and freshly ground black pepper Baby vegetables 225g whole baby (new) potatoes, cleaned 225g baby carrots, cleaned 110g whole baby parsnips, cleaned 225g baby courgettes, flowers attached 225g runner beans, topped and tailed 110g whole baby leeks, cleaned 110g broad beans Make the vegetable dressing by mixing all of the dressing ingredients together (an easy way to do this is to shake them together in a screw-topped jar). Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the potatoes to the water. When the potatoes have been boiling for 6 minutes, place a Chinese steamer over them and pop the carrots and parsnips into the bottom level, nearest the steam. After 2 more minutes, add the courgettes to the carrots and parsnips. Place the remaining vegetables in the top level of the steamer. Cook for a further 3 to 5 minutes, until all of the vegetables are cooked. Note that a colander placed over a large pan of water with a saucepan lid on top will also work as a steamer. Place the vegetables on a serving plate and drizzle the dressing over the top, to taste. Insomnia You may find the following nutritional tips helpful if you have trouble sleeping. \u0095 If you have supper late, try not to eat too much, because excess food-induced indigestion can make you feel uncomfortable and far from sleepy. \u0095 Starchy foods, such as pasta, mashed potatoes and risotto, encourage your body to produce sleep-inducing hormones, so try to base your evening meals around these ingredients. \u0095 Drink camomile (one of the most potent floral remedies for disturbed sleeping patterns) or mint tea at night, rather than caffeine-containing drinks like tea, coffee, hot chocolate and cola-based beverages, and try not to drink such caffeine-rich drinks after midday. Because it stimulates the brain, caffeine adversely affects your ability to sleep well. The ancient Greeks used dill seeds (you will find these in health-food shops and supermarkets) to promote sleep; try infusing them in water. \u0095 Although a little alcohol can relax you, too much will disrupt your body's sleeping patterns - you may sleep for longer but will wake up feeling far from refreshed. Excess alcohol can disrupt your sleep by causing dehydration and drops in blood-sugar level. So stick to drinking a sensible amount of alcohol, and only when your stomach is full. \u0095 Avoid taking vitamin and mineral supplements at night (unless your doctor advises you otherwise) - some supplements stimulate brain activity and prevent you from sleeping well. \u0095 Add a few drops of sleep-promoting herbal and floral essential oils such as basil, camomile and lavender to your bath - they will relax you wonderfully. \u0095 Try to reduce your stress levels. Exercise often and explore other stress-relieving activities. Noodles with red peppers, chicken and cashew nuts Serves 4 Magic ingredient red peppers Even though the magic ingredient is red peppers - rich in betacarotene, an antioxidant that the body converts into vitamin A, which helps to reduce the incidence of cancer, as well as promoting growth, good vision and healthy skin - combining them with the starch-rich noodles (which encourage the production of sleepy hormones) makes this a perfect healthy, soporific supper. dash of olive oil 4 red peppers, cored, de-seeded and chopped into quarters 8 shallots, peeled and halved 3 cloves garlic, peeled but left whole 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves 1 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, chopped 3 chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips 1 tsp olive oil 350g dried noodles 50g cashew nuts salt and freshly ground black pepper Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F/gas mark 6. Brush a roasting tin with a little olive oil. Arrange the peppers, shallots and garlic in the tin and sprinkle with the thyme and rosemary leaves. Bake for 10 minutes. Add the chicken and bake for a further 10 minutes, basting the vegetables occasionally. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and add the salt, olive oil and noodles. Boil for 10 minutes, or until the noodles are al dente. When the chicken is cooked and the vegetables soft and brown around the edges, remove them from the roasting tin. Drain the noodles and combine them with the chicken mixture. Stir in the cashew nuts and season with salt and pepper. Lowering high-cholesterol levels If your cholesterol level is high, it is vital that you watch what you eat. The following nutritional tips will help you to maintain a healthy cholesterol level. \u0095 Eat lots of the foods that produce high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good' cholesterol, such as oily fish, garlic, wholegrains, fruits and vegetables. \u0095 Drink 2 to 3 litres of water a day. Water encourages the fibre in food to swell and stimulates the liver to produce HDL, which carries low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or 'bad' cholesterol, to the gut, from which it is excreted. \u0095 Don't eat too many saturated animal fats. You shouldn't have to avoid them completely, just keep the quantity that you eat down and always accompany them with fibre (team cheese with wholegrain bread and water, for example). As water causes fibre to swell, the swollen fibre in turn cushions the rate and level at which your body absorbs fat. \u0095 Ensure that your intake of antioxidant-rich foods is high. The nutrients present in prunes and other dried and fresh fruit and vegetables - including vitamin C, betacarotene, vitamin E and selenium - help to prevent LDL from being deposited in the blood vessels. \u0095 Remember that drinking a couple of glasses of antioxidant-rich wine a day can not only encourage your body to produce HDL, but the anthrocyanins and other antioxidants that it contains can also play a part in preventing LDL from being deposited in your blood vessels. \u0095 Include garlic in your diet; the allicin it contains inhibits the retention of LDL in the blood vessels. Fresh fruit and yogurt layers Serves 4 Magic ingredient yogurt This attractive-looking dish is both easy to make and nutritious. The berries contain fibre which, in the presence of water, helps the body reduce its bad cholesterol levels and boost our supply of good high density lipoprotein. Berries also contain vitamin C, which can help prevent bad cholesterol from depositing in the blood vessels. 225g strawberries, washed and sliced 225g raspberries, washed 225g blackberries, washed 1 large pot natural Greek-style yogurt Cover the bottom of a glass bowl with a layer of mixed fruit and then add a couple of tablespoonfuls of yogurt. Carry on building up layers of fruit and yogurt until the bowl is full, placing a single piece of fruit in the centre of the final layer of yogurt. Chill the dish in the fridge before serving.",

Nursing home costs of \u00a3400 a week, for instance, could include less than \u00a370 for nursing costs.

Changing dressings and incontinence pads would be nursing care; getting people dressed, helping them eat and pushing them in wheelchairs is classified as personal care. </p> <p>The Alzheimer's Society has urged the Government to create a new category of 'health needs' encompassing all these functions, since the person needs this help because of their health. It is calling on the Government to fund the 'health needs' part of a care package. </p> <p>Chief executive Harry Cayton believes there will be an outcry if the Government chooses the narrow definition. 'In theory, a nursing home has to have just one nurse on duty,' he says. 'On the narrowest definition, the cost of paying for that nurse might be the only element treated as nursing care.' </p> <p>But Peter Gatenby, of Age Concern Financial Partner ships, believes the Government would find all personal care too expensive. It would have to pay for the personal care of people in their own homes as well. At present, most people pay their local authority for services such as meals on wheels and help with bathing and shopping. </p> <p>So Gatenby expects the Government to opt for just free nursing care. 'They would probably do it on an average basis for everyone in a home,' he says. 'It would be a bureaucratic nightmare to do it accurately.' </p> <p>To sugar the pill, the Government could announce some good news, such as increased capital thresholds for those who go into residential or nursing homes. Another controversial proposal is for local authorities to offer loans to people who don't want to sell their homes when they go into care. </p> <p>\u0095 Nursing Home Fees Agency: 0800 99 88 33 </p> <p>\u0095 Age Concern Financial Partnerships: 0800 783 8300</p>",

But campaigners worry that the definition of nursing care could be very narrow. Nursing home costs of \u00a3400 a week, for instance, could include less than \u00a370 for nursing costs. The 150,000 people who go into care homes each year typically pay \u00a3300 a week in a residential home and \u00a3400 a week in a nursing home. People who would be particularly badly hit by a tight definition are the 700,000 people who suffer from dementia. While their mental state requires that they be closely supervised, many get little of the kind of assistance that would be called nursing care. Changing dressings and incontinence pads would be nursing care; getting people dressed, helping them eat and pushing them in wheelchairs is classified as personal care. The Alzheimer's Society has urged the Government to create a new category of 'health needs' encompassing all these functions, since the person needs this help because of their health. It is calling on the Government to fund the 'health needs' part of a care package. Chief executive Harry Cayton believes there will be an outcry if the Government chooses the narrow definition. 'In theory, a nursing home has to have just one nurse on duty,' he says. 'On the narrowest definition, the cost of paying for that nurse might be the only element treated as nursing care.' But Peter Gatenby, of Age Concern Financial Partner ships, believes the Government would find all personal care too expensive. It would have to pay for the personal care of people in their own homes as well. At present, most people pay their local authority for services such as meals on wheels and help with bathing and shopping. So Gatenby expects the Government to opt for just free nursing care. 'They would probably do it on an average basis for everyone in a home,' he says. 'It would be a bureaucratic nightmare to do it accurately.' To sugar the pill, the Government could announce some good news, such as increased capital thresholds for those who go into residential or nursing homes. Another controversial proposal is for local authorities to offer loans to people who don't want to sell their homes when they go into care. \u0095 Nursing Home Fees Agency: 0800 99 88 33 \u0095 Age Concern Financial Partnerships: 0800 783 8300",

      "body": "<p>More than 75 per cent of UK householders are paying too much for their gas and electricity two years after deregulation of the energy market. </p> <p>Although householders have been able to switch gas suppliers for more than two years, and electricity suppliers since last May, fewer than one in four have switched from British Gas and their regional electricity company. Energy company regulator Ofgem says, however, that virtually everyone can benefit by switching suppliers. Rob Jones, spokesman for the watchdog, says: 'You'll al-most certainly find cheaper prices elsewhere if you're still buying from British Gas and your regional electricity company.' </p> <p>Competition between energy companies has been fierce: most householders have had visits from different companies' sales reps. But the sheer range of choice and the complexity of comparing prices from one company to another have put most people off switching. </p> <p>The confusion increased with last week's launch of Virgin Energy, a joint venture between Virgin and London Electricity . Online suppliers have been able to pass their cost savings on to customers in the form of particularly low prices. Virgin Energy, which will start supplying energy in September, claims UK householders could save more than \u00a3630 million a year by switching to its services. </p> <p>The company is so confident its customers will benefit that it is guaranteeing to compensate them if they end up paying more by switching from their existing supplier (the offer is based on prices charged at the time of switching accounts). 'If after the first year customers haven't saved money, Virgin Energy will refund the difference plus 20 per cent - so customers simply can't lose,' it says. </p> <p>But Virgin Energy's pose as consumer champion has angered online competitors Amerada and Servista. Both companies offer cheaper gas than their new competitor, and cheaper electricity in several regions. For example, the owner of a medium-sized house in the Eastern region who uses 3300 kWh of electricity a year - the average as estimated by energy regulator Ofgem - would pay Amerada \u00a3194.73, Servista \u00a3221.40, and Virgin \u00a3260.22. </p> <p>Virgin says its customers will make the biggest savings by opt ing for a combined gas and electricity service. While Virgin will offer discounts of up to 15 per cent for customers who opt for dual fuels, neither Amerada nor Servista offers any reduction. Jon Kinsey, managing director of Virgin Energy, says: 'Most consumers want to get just one bill and aren't interested in buying separate services from different sources. Everyone wants dual fuel because that's where the best discounts are.' </p> <p>However, Amerada's dual fuel prices, calculated by adding the single service prices quoted on its website, still come up cheaper than Virgin's. But as Paul Farrelly's tale of woe (below) shows, customers should not base their choice of supplier entirely on price. Virgin says one of the reasons it chose London Electricity as a partner was because of the good record of its customer service centre in Exeter. Kinley says: 'We will not let our customers down. It's not just about price - it's about service, too. From time to time other companies will offer cheaper prices, but I'm not going to cut into our service levels to match their prices.' </p> <p>Environmental issues may also sway your decision. While Virgin is promising to pay its customers \u00a31 for every 1 per cent by which they reduce their energy consumption year on year, Servista offers 'green' electricity. While this costs an average of \u00a31.40 a month more than its standard electricity, customers can rest easy in the knowledge that their money is buying hydro-electric and wind-generated power. </p> <p> <strong> Funny by gaslight </strong></p> <p>Is this consumer ecstatic about energy market liberalisation? Not unless high bills and headaches are on your wishlist. </p> <p>We moved into our place in north London last September, only to find that the previous owner had agreed to switch gas suppliers without telling us. He'd done the same with the electricity, but that transfer didn't go through. That didn't stop enterprising little Independent Energy from charging us \u00a370 for juice supplied by London Electricity!</p> <p>The oddest thing about this new system is that the original supplier is not obliged to contact the customer first to confirm that they want to switch. You'd think it would be in their commercial interest - otherwise anyone could pretend to have signed you up. But London Electricity's gas arm accepted the say-so of Amerada Hess, which had talked our predecessor into signing on the dotted line.</p> <p>I now know that delays in the system meant the transfer actually occurred two months later, at the end of November. A simple call to us then would have been enough to send Amerada packing.

      "body": "<p><strong> Joshua and the BBC's promised land</strong><br> Greg Dyke's whirlwind at the newsroom continues unabated. The departure of legal correspondent Joshua Rozenberg for the Telegraph after more than 20 years with the corporation has sparked a new phrase. Apparently, if a correspondent's hair is not quite long and blonde enough, or one's skirt is not quite short enough, you are likely to be described as 'a bit Rozenberg'. </p> <p>Also - you read it here first - the BBC's hunt for a business editor is on and though it is likely to go to non-screen Robert Thirkell rather than a top business celeb, our prediction that Jeff Randall, editor of Sunday Business , was in the running also seems to be true. Randall was being wined and dined as late as this Friday by top brass at the BBC, but largely, it seems, as an 'unpaid consultant' on what to do about their business coverage. They would it seems like to offer Randall the job, but would be embarrassed to get into negotiations over salary, as the \u00a350,000 a year and company bike that goes with the job may not quite meet his current expectations. </p> <p><strong> Window on the shrinking world</strong><br> Also what of the amazing shrinking brief of new current affairs supremo Peter Horrocks?

      "bodyText": "Joshua and the BBC's promised land Greg Dyke's whirlwind at the newsroom continues unabated. The departure of legal correspondent Joshua Rozenberg for the Telegraph after more than 20 years with the corporation has sparked a new phrase. Apparently, if a correspondent's hair is not quite long and blonde enough, or one's skirt is not quite short enough, you are likely to be described as 'a bit Rozenberg'. Also - you read it here first - the BBC's hunt for a business editor is on and though it is likely to go to non-screen Robert Thirkell rather than a top business celeb, our prediction that Jeff Randall, editor of Sunday Business , was in the running also seems to be true. Randall was being wined and dined as late as this Friday by top brass at the BBC, but largely, it seems, as an 'unpaid consultant' on what to do about their business coverage. They would it seems like to offer Randall the job, but would be embarrassed to get into negotiations over salary, as the \u00a350,000 a year and company bike that goes with the job may not quite meet his current expectations. Window on the shrinking world Also what of the amazing shrinking brief of new current affairs supremo Peter Horrocks? We learn that Horrocks, who was to be in charge of Panorama and the Money Programme has lost the latter to the aforementioned Robert Thirkell, who will now be overseeing a 'radical overhaul' of the show. Which leaves Horrocks with, er, Panorama , where he was editor before his elevation, and his first job will no doubt be to appoint a new editor of Panorama ! A tangled web indeed. Tried by Piers In the 'not fit to print' category this week was apparently the tail-end of Piers Morgan's sponsor's address to Women in Journalism, which caused such offence that the assembled audience slow hand-clapped and cat called - with several members of the audience turning their back on Morgan despite his company generously providing the cocktail sausages.

      "body": "<p>It's been like pulling teeth, but last week Diageo finally admitted to talks about selling off Pillsbury foods in the US. </p> <p>After flat delivery of an otherwise encouraging trading statement, shares in the drinks giant succumbed to profit-taking last week. </p> <p>At 595p - following a precipitate nosedive into the new millennium - the stock is now just back, fortunately, to where it was last October. Then we advised you to buy, as 'the long-mooted spin-off of Pillsbury or Burger King may not be too far away'. </p> <p>With a flotation of Burger King in the pipeline, both are now firmly on the agenda, and we are sticking to our guns. Last week's news from Diageo's core spirits arm was encouraging, with revenues up 9 per cent. Broker Merrill Lynch thinks the division could yet turn in double-digit earnings growth this year. With efficiency savings, that goes for Guinness, too. </p> <p>Until the price of Seagram's spirits division becomes clear, shares in rival Allied Domecq are likely to drift. Allied holders could do worse, in the near term, than switching to Diageo. </p> <p><strong> Going nowhere</strong><br> Catalogue group N Brown has fallen from grace of late after the dissipation of internet-fuelled expectations for its new Zendor logistics and fulfilment operation. So is Sir David Alliance's home- shopping outfit due for a rebound? </p> <p>The answer, according to the latest note from broker Salomon Smith Barney, is firmly negative. Back in March, when the shares were changing hands at 785p, Salomons got it absolutely right. At that level, the market was valuing the start-up Zendor at \u00a3770m, implying a likely profitability that demanded revenues of some \u00a35 billion. Yet N Brown's own sales were just \u00a3350m. </p> <p>While Zendor is seen emphatically as a 'good thing', even now it appears to be valued at \u00a3300m - still demanding for a start-up that is only slowly signing up new business, Salomon says. At 264p, the shares are currently going nowhere.

      "bodyText": "It's been like pulling teeth, but last week Diageo finally admitted to talks about selling off Pillsbury foods in the US. After flat delivery of an otherwise encouraging trading statement, shares in the drinks giant succumbed to profit-taking last week. At 595p - following a precipitate nosedive into the new millennium - the stock is now just back, fortunately, to where it was last October. Then we advised you to buy, as 'the long-mooted spin-off of Pillsbury or Burger King may not be too far away'. With a flotation of Burger King in the pipeline, both are now firmly on the agenda, and we are sticking to our guns. Last week's news from Diageo's core spirits arm was encouraging, with revenues up 9 per cent. Broker Merrill Lynch thinks the division could yet turn in double-digit earnings growth this year. With efficiency savings, that goes for Guinness, too. Until the price of Seagram's spirits division becomes clear, shares in rival Allied Domecq are likely to drift. Allied holders could do worse, in the near term, than switching to Diageo. Going nowhere Catalogue group N Brown has fallen from grace of late after the dissipation of internet-fuelled expectations for its new Zendor logistics and fulfilment operation. So is Sir David Alliance's home- shopping outfit due for a rebound? The answer, according to the latest note from broker Salomon Smith Barney, is firmly negative. Back in March, when the shares were changing hands at 785p, Salomons got it absolutely right. At that level, the market was valuing the start-up Zendor at \u00a3770m, implying a likely profitability that demanded revenues of some \u00a35 billion. Yet N Brown's own sales were just \u00a3350m. While Zendor is seen emphatically as a 'good thing', even now it appears to be valued at \u00a3300m - still demanding for a start-up that is only slowly signing up new business, Salomon says. At 264p, the shares are currently going nowhere. Sell. Cell, cell, cell Sticking with Salomons for a moment, the broker's engineering team has a passion for new energy sources which reaches anorak-like intensity. Fuel cells are, they believe, the revolutionary new power play of the future. These devices generate electricity from hydrogen and oxygen in the air, and emit nothing more than water and heat as waste. In an environment-conscious world, with rising petrol prices, the future for this much-improving technology is bright, Salomons believes. Sales of all types of fuel cell in 1998 totalled $355m, and by 2004 they may be worth nearly $4bn, according to latest research. To jump on this bandwagon, you may want to look at Johnson Matthey, the world leader in catalysts for fuel cells. In the next few years, the technology could well be Matthey's main driver for growth. The broker's price target for the shares is 1100p, against 965p now. Great run Take profits at Umeco, the latest vehicle of Williams co-founder Brian McGowan. After disposals and getting to grips with a number of bolt-on acquisitions, the aerospace components and chemicals group now appears well poised for further growth, both organically and through more deals. Umeco is focusing on providing procurement services for aerospace customers, who are increasingly outsourcing work. At 655p, the shares have had a great run since the autumn and jumped 10 per cent last week following its agm and a strong buy note from broker Old Mutual. News until the interims in December will be sparse, however, so the excitement is likely to die down and the share price, too.",

      "body": "<p>John Von Spreckelsen, executive chairman of Somerfield, professes himself unfazed by the task of revitalising the supermarket chain. Budgens, his previous employer, was in a poor state when he joined it in 1991 and he managed to transform it into one of the best local foodstores in the high street. </p> <p>His success in doing that is undisputed. The trouble is that very success has made his job at Somerfield harder, as Budgens is now a formidable competitor on that same high street. Worse, at Somerfield he has to grapple with the problem of properly integrating not just the Kwik Save acquisition but earlier purchases that left the group with 'different and not necessarily compatible' supply chains. </p> <p>Then there are the challenges of running two completely different brands, neither of them exactly robust, of reinvigorating a demoralised workforce, and of re-educating customers about what Kwik Save and Somerfield actually stand for. All of this at a time when majors such as Tesco and Safeway are becoming even more competitive. Small wonder that von Spreckelsen warns that: 'The benefits will take some time to come through.' </p> <p>The figures for the year to 29 April make gruesome reading. Profits before tax and exceptionals plunged from \u00a3218.4 million to \u00a370.7m; write-offs and disposals cost a further \u00a385.2m. Overall, sales fell by 7.3 per cent. That was largely due to the mass defection of customers at Kwik Save as the previous management took the stores - and the prices - upmarket. The effect was to send sales, excluding store openings and closures, down by almost 15 per cent. </p> <p>But Somerfield, too, is suffering, perhaps because management became distracted by the scale of the task of dealing with the merger. Over the year, its sales dropped 1.8 per cent but the most alarming thing is that the trend has been steadily worsening: in the first half of last year they were steady; in the second half they fell 3.8 per cent and are currently dropping by an alarming 7.1 per cent. </p> <p>The group tries to put a favourable gloss on this bad news, saying that both chains are now slightly less awful than they were in the final quarter of its financial year. Others find it a bit harder to see what von Spreckelsen describes as 'promising beginnings'. </p> <p>The 'immediate priorities' that he lists for each of the chains would tax even the most energetic of managers. Somerfield needs to improve profitability and customer service, energise its staff and cut its prices. Kwik Save needs reassurance that it will survive, investment in the brand, improvements in its stores, better pricing and more fresh food. Indeed, it is hard to find things that do not need fixing. </p> <p>The simple fact is that von Spreckelsen will have to devote himself to stabilising the group, at least in the short term. Only when that has been accomplished can he re-direct his energy to accelerating sales growth. </p> <p>That puts the two chains in a worse position than they were in before the merger was agreed two years ago. At 57p, the shares stand at about a quarter of their high for the year. But analysts think that trading will get worse before it gets better - indeed some are forecasting that it will make a loss in the current year. The most pessimistic question is whether it will get better at all. It would certainly be unwise to buy until there is more evidence that it can. </p> <p><strong> A clear buy</strong><br> The City got quite excited when Pilkington, the world's biggest glassmaker, announced it was in talks to buy the glass business of Visteon, the US group that has just been hived off from Ford in the US. The excitement is at least partly justified. Pilks chief executive Paolo Scaroni has exceeded everyone's expectations in Europe, where the glassmaker has gone from lagging far behind its competitors to being one of the most efficient producers in just three years. Margins have doubled to 9 per cent and overheads have been sliced by 20 per cent. </p> <p>In the US, however, the programme is just beginning - a \u00a368m restructuring charge was set aside last year and it will probably take three years to achieve the full \u00a380m promised cost savings. At first glance, it seemed that Visteon could make a big difference. It is far less efficient than Pilks' own operations - until earlier this year, it was part of Ford's empire but hardly the car company's highest priority. Listing particulars show that its net income last year was just $3m on sales of $773m. Surely Pilks could manage to achieve more than an 0.4 per cent return. </p> <p>The problem for Scaroni, however, is guaranteeing that he can do better. Because it was so recently part of Ford, the business will come with all sorts of baggage - not least that its heavily unionised workforce are paid about $46 an hour, double that at Pilks' own US plants. </p> <p>Any sale agreement is, however, likely to include a complicated supply agreement with Ford under which it not only contracts to buy a specified amount of glass, but also effectively underwrites the costs of keeping on that workforce. While Pilks will pay their salaries, it will effectively pass the bill back to Ford. </p> <p>More interesting, however, is what Pilks can do with the remaining costs. That is still unclear. The best result would be to amalgamate all the operations, cutting overheads and optimising efficiency. Adding Visteon would effectively double the size of the business, and reduce its dependence on General Motors - its major customer in the US. </p> <p>It is not yet clear, however, whether that will be possible under the agreement with Ford. Add problems such as allowing for the possibility that inflation will accelerate, and haggling over price, and it is easy to see why it could take months before anything is signed, if anything ever is. </p> <p>There would undoubtedly be considerable disappointment if the deal does not go ahead. But it would not be a disaster. Scaroni has won his spurs sorting out Europe, and he should be trusted to get the US on track. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Pilks is looking better placed than it has been for years, as demand and prices both move in its favour. </p> <p>Throg Street has recommended buying in the past only to see the shares fall. This time, however, there should be no downside. Buy.</p>",

But this course surely depends on companies giving their owners enough detail to work out what kind of salaries their packages will provide.

      "body": "<p>Just how long can it go on? This is the idle question raised as we slide towards such stimulating events as the Comprehensive Spending Review and the cats and dogs' days of summer. I refer of course to the festering ill-feeling between Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street. </p> <p>The answer, on the Thatcher/Lawson scale, is that it could have considerably longer to ferment before either Gordon Brown, or Tony Blair has to go. But it is good speculative sport for the rainy season as it would seem to the casual observer that relations have, at least temporarily, hit an all-time low. Tony Blair's unprecedented presentation of the unemployment figures was clearly a pooping of Gordon's quarterly party. The serried ranks of Cooks, Byers and Mandelson's weighing in on the euro debate is undoubtedly irritating the hell out of Old Brown who, in the style of his namesake in Squirrel Nutkin, will be looking for a couple of tails to tear off. And the question has been raised in more than one quarter - who will go first? The Prime Minister or the Chancellor? </p> <p>The answer would clearly be neither, before the the next election - but afterwards? Could we really see the entente discordiale preserved through a second term? If things bump along the bottom as they have for the past seven days, but with a cooling economy, it would be reasonable to expect a parting of the ways before we are too far into 2002.

      "bodyText": "Just how long can it go on? This is the idle question raised as we slide towards such stimulating events as the Comprehensive Spending Review and the cats and dogs' days of summer. I refer of course to the festering ill-feeling between Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street. The answer, on the Thatcher/Lawson scale, is that it could have considerably longer to ferment before either Gordon Brown, or Tony Blair has to go. But it is good speculative sport for the rainy season as it would seem to the casual observer that relations have, at least temporarily, hit an all-time low. Tony Blair's unprecedented presentation of the unemployment figures was clearly a pooping of Gordon's quarterly party. The serried ranks of Cooks, Byers and Mandelson's weighing in on the euro debate is undoubtedly irritating the hell out of Old Brown who, in the style of his namesake in Squirrel Nutkin, will be looking for a couple of tails to tear off. And the question has been raised in more than one quarter - who will go first? The Prime Minister or the Chancellor? The answer would clearly be neither, before the the next election - but afterwards? Could we really see the entente discordiale preserved through a second term? If things bump along the bottom as they have for the past seven days, but with a cooling economy, it would be reasonable to expect a parting of the ways before we are too far into 2002. But the issue of who will outlast whom is set to be one of the great guessing games for the next Parliament. For starters there is the theory that says Blair, for all his lack of Gordon's psychological flaws, is a more likely candidate for the chop. He is the one with a family to spend more time with; and second, Tony is pro-euro.

'The strongest [form of] inequality in France was unemployment.' </p> <p>Muet attributes the current performance to Lionel Jospin's three-pronged economic strategy. Strong co-ordination of macroeconomic policy in Europe was the first prong. Low interest rates and smaller public debt associated with entry to the euro were a stimulus after years of high long-term interest rates. The deficit was reduced slowly at first, then sharply in 1999. The government has since focused on tax cuts, and continued to reduce the deficit at a lower rate. </p> <p>Increasing growth by increasing employment was the second prong. The government initiated a New Deal-esque scheme to bring unemployed young people into the economy. </p> <p>'France experienced a virtuous circle of increasing confidence and increasing employment, with emphasis on the new economy and new technology,' says Muet. </p> <p>The third prong was to develop a dialogue between firms and employees in order to foster job creation by moderating wage claims. 'There is a trade-off between employment and an increase in personal incomes,' he says. </p> <p>The clearest manifestation of this was the 35-hour week, but Muet says that despite the decrease in working time there has been no decrease in competitiveness. </p> <p>Most analysts attribute this to the flexibility afforded to large employers in renegotiating contracts around the implementation of the new law. Although any hours worked above 35 are subject to extra payment, and in some cases time off in lieu, larger companies have used the 35-hour week to go back to to the drawing board on basic contracts, and wage costs have so far been held down. </p> <p>Winning a reduction in hours worked was the carrot for employees in this social bargain. But the pro-business measures in the legislation incurred the wrath of motorway-blockading unionists. </p> <p>'This may unwind over the next two years: the trade unions could push wage claims,' says Alison Cottrell, an analyst at Paine Webber. </p> <p>In 2002, the reduction in working time will be enforced for small businesses, and there are fears that there will be less room for flexibility. </p> <p>Core inflation is low, at 1.1 per cent, but it has moved up from 0.5 per cent since the end of the year. Inward investment is strong, but many analysts believe such performance has come about despite, rather than because of, measures such as the 35-hour week. </p> <p>'France is doing well by European standards, but compared with America it's going nowhere,' says Cottrell. </p> <p>Consumer confidence is in part a reflection of better employment prospects, but also low inflation and large tax cuts, including a 1 per cent drop in VAT in April. </p> <p>The economy has benefited from a weak euro and the recovery in world trade, especially in terms of tourism and car exports. </p> <p>But it is the telecommunications-media sector that is creating the buzz in French business and its stock market.

      "body": "<p>British shipbuilding led the world a century ago. In 1914 it employed 200,000 people, building vessels for the biggest merchant and military fleets to sail the seven seas. Yet today the UK yards employ 26,000 people, building between 25 and 30 cruise ships, specialist and naval vessels a year - all told, a mere 2 per cent of the global market. </p> <p>British shipbuilding has been in crisis for decades, but in the past few years its very survival has been questioned. Once-great shipyards have changed ownership numerous times as attempts to find a formula to reinvigorate the industry have come and gone. Cammell Laird in Birkenhead closed in 1993, and was later bought by a ship repairer rather than a builder. Swan Hunter on Tyneside is now owned by a Dutch entrepreneur who advocates making Ikea-style 'kit ships'. </p> <p>Last year the Government was forced to make desperate efforts to find a buyer for the Clydeside Govan yard when Norwegian owner Kvaerner pulled out. And earlier this year the failure of Belfast-based Harland &amp; Wolff to win the \u00a3450 million contract to build a new Queen Mary led to redundancy notices for its 1,300 workers, though another order later kept the yard open. </p> <p>In the eyes of the industry it was not before time that the Government last Thursday added shipbuilding to car makers and textiles as a sector worthy of a summit meeting with Ministers. </p> <p>But the idea of state involvement will have caused queasiness for some. Intervention has been tried before - without success. It followed the 1967 Geddes report, which called for the creation of big yards such as Govan and Swan Hunter. Then there was the 1977 decision that 'lame ducks' needed propping up by the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund (SIF). Nationalisation in the same year has been widely blamed for the present problems. Whether or not this is fair, current UK shipbuilders say the Government has a vital role to play now - though not to prop up lame ducks. </p> <p>Nick Granger of the Shipbuilders and Ship Repairers Association says: 'We are looking to double the market share of UK yards in international merchant work, which accounts for about \u00a3550m of the industry's current \u00a32bn turnover. A lot of this we have to do ourselves, to be competitive. But there is a lot of unfair competition in global markets, and that is where the Government has got to help.' </p> <p>The future for the UK, says Granger, is as a producer of high-value 'niche' vessels - cruise liners, ferries, cable-layers and ships for offshore industries. But in an international market with, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 30 per cent overcapacity, the UK, like continental Europe, is long dead as a producer of volume shipping - tankers, container ships, bulk carriers. It has been blown away by competition from the Far East. </p> <p>Much of Asia's shipbuilding is done by South Korean yards, which, says Granger, are heavily subsidised. Last year South Korea had 29.4 per cent of the world market - up from 20 per cent in 1995. Its expansion has been at the expense of Japan and Europe. </p> <p>In 1950 the UK still had 37.9 per cent of the global gross tonnage, though in reality the industry has been declining since 1918. Historically, Britain has been slow to innovate - missing out, for example, on the tanker boom of the Thirties - and slow to invest in new technology such as welding. Strategy was also lacking. While continental industries were marshalled so that production was more carefully allocated between builders, and export markets groomed, UK builders kept close to UK ship owners, often not seeking work abroad. </p> <p>Poor management and industrial relations meant British shipbuilding became ever more vulnerable. Government subsidies date from as far back as the Depression. </p> <p>Despite all that, Granger now argues that the worst is over. First, demand for ships is strong. Obsolescence and growth in trade has raised demand by around 3 per cent a year, and it is now reaching its highest levels since the last peak, in 1975. </p> <p>He says that of the 2,600 vessels over 100 tonnes produced a year, 2,000 are in the classes of ships at which UK yards excel. The vessels are worth more because their specifications are higher. </p> <p>Underpinning this is Royal Naval work, which accounts for the lion's share of the yards' \u00a32bn turnover. Last week, for example, the Government placed a \u00a31bn order for three destroyers with BAe systems and Vosper Thorneycroft, securing 5,500 jobs. </p> <p>In addition, UK yards such as Cammell Laird specialise in higher-margin repair work. This, says Granger, represents \u00a3350m of the \u00a3550m merchant shipping turnover. </p> <p>Cammell Laird's deputy chief executive, Brett Martin, says: 'Life is very difficult. The Koreans are able to build ships at low rates, and other European countries are cleverer about subsidies. We have to specialise.' </p> <p>Cammell Laird last week announced a 53 per cent rise in annual profits. It is buying yards in France and the US and is also building ships again, winning a \u00a38m order for ferries from Norway.But Martin believes much has still to be done to improve the position of UK yards. He believes contracts should not be assigned to single yards.

      "bodyText": "British shipbuilding led the world a century ago. In 1914 it employed 200,000 people, building vessels for the biggest merchant and military fleets to sail the seven seas. Yet today the UK yards employ 26,000 people, building between 25 and 30 cruise ships, specialist and naval vessels a year - all told, a mere 2 per cent of the global market. British shipbuilding has been in crisis for decades, but in the past few years its very survival has been questioned. Once-great shipyards have changed ownership numerous times as attempts to find a formula to reinvigorate the industry have come and gone. Cammell Laird in Birkenhead closed in 1993, and was later bought by a ship repairer rather than a builder. Swan Hunter on Tyneside is now owned by a Dutch entrepreneur who advocates making Ikea-style 'kit ships'. Last year the Government was forced to make desperate efforts to find a buyer for the Clydeside Govan yard when Norwegian owner Kvaerner pulled out. And earlier this year the failure of Belfast-based Harland &amp; Wolff to win the \u00a3450 million contract to build a new Queen Mary led to redundancy notices for its 1,300 workers, though another order later kept the yard open. In the eyes of the industry it was not before time that the Government last Thursday added shipbuilding to car makers and textiles as a sector worthy of a summit meeting with Ministers. But the idea of state involvement will have caused queasiness for some. Intervention has been tried before - without success. It followed the 1967 Geddes report, which called for the creation of big yards such as Govan and Swan Hunter. Then there was the 1977 decision that 'lame ducks' needed propping up by the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund (SIF). Nationalisation in the same year has been widely blamed for the present problems. Whether or not this is fair, current UK shipbuilders say the Government has a vital role to play now - though not to prop up lame ducks. Nick Granger of the Shipbuilders and Ship Repairers Association says: 'We are looking to double the market share of UK yards in international merchant work, which accounts for about \u00a3550m of the industry's current \u00a32bn turnover. A lot of this we have to do ourselves, to be competitive. But there is a lot of unfair competition in global markets, and that is where the Government has got to help.' The future for the UK, says Granger, is as a producer of high-value 'niche' vessels - cruise liners, ferries, cable-layers and ships for offshore industries. But in an international market with, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 30 per cent overcapacity, the UK, like continental Europe, is long dead as a producer of volume shipping - tankers, container ships, bulk carriers. It has been blown away by competition from the Far East. Much of Asia's shipbuilding is done by South Korean yards, which, says Granger, are heavily subsidised. Last year South Korea had 29.4 per cent of the world market - up from 20 per cent in 1995. Its expansion has been at the expense of Japan and Europe. In 1950 the UK still had 37.9 per cent of the global gross tonnage, though in reality the industry has been declining since 1918. Historically, Britain has been slow to innovate - missing out, for example, on the tanker boom of the Thirties - and slow to invest in new technology such as welding. Strategy was also lacking. While continental industries were marshalled so that production was more carefully allocated between builders, and export markets groomed, UK builders kept close to UK ship owners, often not seeking work abroad. Poor management and industrial relations meant British shipbuilding became ever more vulnerable. Government subsidies date from as far back as the Depression. Despite all that, Granger now argues that the worst is over. First, demand for ships is strong. Obsolescence and growth in trade has raised demand by around 3 per cent a year, and it is now reaching its highest levels since the last peak, in 1975. He says that of the 2,600 vessels over 100 tonnes produced a year, 2,000 are in the classes of ships at which UK yards excel. The vessels are worth more because their specifications are higher. Underpinning this is Royal Naval work, which accounts for the lion's share of the yards' \u00a32bn turnover. Last week, for example, the Government placed a \u00a31bn order for three destroyers with BAe systems and Vosper Thorneycroft, securing 5,500 jobs. In addition, UK yards such as Cammell Laird specialise in higher-margin repair work. This, says Granger, represents \u00a3350m of the \u00a3550m merchant shipping turnover. Cammell Laird's deputy chief executive, Brett Martin, says: 'Life is very difficult. The Koreans are able to build ships at low rates, and other European countries are cleverer about subsidies. We have to specialise.' Cammell Laird last week announced a 53 per cent rise in annual profits. It is buying yards in France and the US and is also building ships again, winning a \u00a38m order for ferries from Norway.But Martin believes much has still to be done to improve the position of UK yards. He believes contracts should not be assigned to single yards. Cammell Laird has made a joint bid with Harland &amp; Wolff for a \u00a3200m Ministry of Defence contract for six landing craft. His view is shared by Jaap Kroese, the Dutch entrepre neur who bought Swan Hunter five years ago for \u00a34m. Kroese advocates more prefabrication of vessels, allowing different yards to work on different parts of the same vessel simultaneously. Costly equipment should be pooled, some at a newly equipped yard financed by all major companies, so that expensive tasks could be performed centrally. At the cutting edge of this would be the standardised 'kit ships' which he believes could revolutionise design and production, slash costs and take on the Asian firms. 'I would not be here if there was not a future,' Kroese says. 'But there is an efficiency problem in the UK, compared with Dutch and German yards. There should be greater collaboration between UK yards.' Granger estimates that a 20 per cent improvement in productivity is needed to compete even with Dutch, German and Italian yards. The high pound has not helped, but they can typically undercut UK quotes by 5 per cent. There are signs of optimism though. For example, after its disappointment in March, Harland &amp; Wolff won a \u00a3300m ferry order and a \u00a3230m cruise ship contract. And Swan Hunter recently built a dry dock in which to build a new generation of aircraft carriers.

The dancers remove their tops, revealing oiled pecs and powdered breasts decorated with black tassels. Kylie reappears in a gold bikini top and frilly hotpants.

Privilege, the Wembley Arena of superclubs, is dismally short on atmosphere, thanks to its high ceiling and the striplights of the merchandise shop shining coldly from one side. And, despite the presence of a few spectacularly cleavaged transsexuals and some male podium dancers in dresses and fishnets, this is a very straight crowd. No one really dances during Kylie's set; they're all too busy leering. </p> <p>Still Kylie ploughs on with the kitsch. The only moment of seriousness comes when she plays 'Confide in Me', the drone-filled 1994 hit which was modelled on Madonna's 'Justify My Love'.

      "body": "<p><strong> Vinnie Goes to Hollywood </strong> (BBC1) <br> <strong> Being Caprice (C4) </strong> <br> <strong> The Real Queen Mother (C4) </strong> </p> <p> Last week, a new and appalling threat was added to the potential horrors of nuclear conflict. 'If there was a holocaust,' warned the film director Guy Ritchie, 'there would be several things that'd survive. Vinnie would be one of them.' Vinnie, of course, is the former footballer turned film actor, Vinnie Jones. A player of severely limited skill but limitless severity, Jones's sporting career was essentially one long dogged attempt to earn a place in British life as a 'character' - that sentimental epithet more traditionally awarded to criminal psychopaths. </p> <p> Vinnie Goes to Hollywood confirmed that Jones has unquestionably attained the status of a character - a character actor, in fact - and one who now earns a very good living portraying criminal psychopaths. </p> <p> The film, which followed the onetime Wimbledon hatchet man from one expansive room to another in his Hollywood home, was strangely uneven. As Jones is not overburdened with self-insight, he provided plenty of entertainment. 'I want \u00a320 million,' he told the camera. 'I want to be Brad Pitt and I want everything that comes with it.' He also announced that he is the natural heir to Sean Connery and that he was looking to win an Oscar. </p> <p> But this was not some knowing send-up of a crude fantasist, so much as a breathless celebration of a Great British Phenomenon. The narration, which was reminiscent of an MTV spe cial promotion, informed us that Jones's performance in Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was 'the most terrifying and electrifying debut by any British actor in years'. </p> <p> The relative success of Lock, Stock... has been responsible for much of the recent glamorisation of gangsters, which has included countless 'former' villains cashing in on their newfound celebrity and a spate of awful British caper movies. The chief beneficiary, though, has been Jones. In just one scene (lifted from Raging Bull ), in which he bashed a car door against another man's head, he established himself as a screen hard man. </p> <p> Even as a footballer, Jones seemed a little too fond of his tough-guy image, memorably releasing a video on his worst tackles. And once again he recalled his exploits with pride, as he vented his feelings for a former football opponent: 'I wanted to kill him. I literally wanted to rip both his arms off and his head.' (Is it any wonder that English football players cannot pass a ball?) He also confessed to biting a sports reporter's nose. </p> <p> Jones has realised that to bolster the myth for the movie market, he needs to create a bit of a ducking'n' diving past, which is not easy when you hail from Bedmont in the Hertfordshire countryside. However, the programme-makers were almost touchingly willing to help. 'It may look sleepy and suburban,' growled the narrator, as the camera surveyed what was a typical English village, 'but this was a tough place to grow up.' </p> <p> We learned that Vinnie stole biscuits from his neighbours. 'That was the way we were brought up,' Jones admitted, unabashed. Joe Kinnear, another veteran of the backstreets of the Watford suburbs, seemed to be a little more embarrassed when he suggested that the alternative to football round their way was prison. (In some parallel and happier universe, there is an HMP made up exclusively of rock stars like Roger Daltrey and sportsmen like Kinnear, jailed for fictional nostalgia of a criminal nature.) </p> <p> The lads' magazine journalism reached a surreal pitch when Jim White, TV's resident football intellectual, theorised that Jones's impact on our consciousness was the result of a new breed of ironic, middle-class football fans. He also spoke of his 'style' as a player and even his 'depth'. I'm not sure if he was being ironic. None of the programme's socio-cultural analysis convinced, mostly because it was so conspicuously in thrall to Vinnie's charmless charm. The film only really worked when it captured Jones going about his busily empty schedule in Hollywood - the pool, the golf course, the limousine - where he rented a house in the hills that was once inhabited by Elizabeth Hurley. Here we saw Vinnie with his voice coach, a job only marginally less thankless than that held by the childhood friend who is now his personal assistant in charge of luggage - 'Where's my Louis Voot-on case?' asked Jones, scarily. </p> <p> We might have sent the Americans Vinnie, but they have returned the favour with interest by donating Caprice, a woman whose craving for fame and attention makes Jones look like a bashful reclusive. </p> <p> In Being Caprice, the bra model and occasional pop singer, wore a concealed camera for 10 days so that we might share in her experiences as a 'celebrity'. The result was strangely compelling in a Warholian kind of way. Not only in the sense of the 15 minutes of fame, but more so in the transfixing banality that marked the artist's factory films. </p> <p> We saw Caprice take yoghurt from the fridge. We saw her go to the lavatory, during which her spy camera paid invasive homage to Sharon Stone in the flashing scene from Basic Instinct (perhaps understandably, she was unable to pee). We heard her singing, blushingly flat. </p> <p> 'I agreed to do this,' she said of wearing the camera, 'because I think a lot of people have a misconception of Caprice's world.' In this looping statement are contained all the ingredients of the modern celebrity: the reluctant self-publicist, the misunderstood 'real' person beneath the media creation, and the self-aggrandisement of the third-person reference. </p> <p> We also saw her do the celebrity rounds - MTV, Hello! , Maxim Woman of the Year Award - and glimpsed the mechanics of the fame game. A story, whose provenance was not explained, had been published claiming that the model was dating Prince Andrew. Caprice coyly denied it: 'If I had kissed him, do you think I'd tell you?' </p> <p> So a nobody did not sleep with a do-nothing and the non-news played and played. The camera appeared well placed on Caprice. We saw what she saw - applauding faceless men and professional sycophants - but seldom saw Caprice herself, lending the suitable impression that no one was really there. </p> <p> It's a depressing thought that a dim-witted prince like Andrew can still command such interest. According to The Real Queen Mother , the position that the Windsors continue to hold in the nation's affections, despite their dysfunction, is largely down to Andrew's grandmother. She, it was argued, 'is the architect of the modern monarchy [who] rebranded the royal product'. </p> <p> It seemed a brave move by C4 to broadcast what looked to be a critical biography in the month of her 100th birthday. But it turned out to be a toothless attack. The prob lem is that the old dear has restricted access to a number of government papers that are thought to show her in a less than glowing light. She has not granted an interview since 1923 and her financial affairs are shrouded in secrecy. </p> <p> Given such impenetrability, the documentary had to rely on a number of biographers, who themselves had little to go on other than rumour and hearsay. These people are quite intriguing insofar as their work appears to be the product of dramatic empathy, rather like that of spiritualists calling up the dead, but they don't make for hard-hitting factual TV. </p> <p> What we learned we already knew: that Queen Elizabeth, as she was before her daughter, was the power behind her husband's throne and a staunch appeaser leading up to the war. And that it was not until the Luftwaffe bombed Buckingham Palace that she was able to reinvent herself and the Royal Family as symbols of British fighting spirit. </p> <p> The most disturbing contribution came from the Rev Anthony Harbottle, chaplain to the Queen. 'Quite simply,' he declared, 'Queen Elizabeth's got a foot in heaven. And that,' he added, as if he had it on good authority from God, 'is true.' </p> <p> Unwittingly, then, these three programmes presented three cornerstones of British culture: thuggery, celebrity, royalty. That's some kind of rallying call. </p> <p>\u0095 Kathryn Flett is away</p>",

(In some parallel and happier universe, there is an HMP made up exclusively of rock stars like Roger Daltrey and sportsmen like Kinnear, jailed for fictional nostalgia of a criminal nature.) The lads' magazine journalism reached a surreal pitch when Jim White, TV's resident football intellectual, theorised that Jones's impact on our consciousness was the result of a new breed of ironic, middle-class football fans. He also spoke of his 'style' as a player and even his 'depth'. I'm not sure if he was being ironic. None of the programme's socio-cultural analysis convinced, mostly because it was so conspicuously in thrall to Vinnie's charmless charm. The film only really worked when it captured Jones going about his busily empty schedule in Hollywood - the pool, the golf course, the limousine - where he rented a house in the hills that was once inhabited by Elizabeth Hurley. Here we saw Vinnie with his voice coach, a job only marginally less thankless than that held by the childhood friend who is now his personal assistant in charge of luggage - 'Where's my Louis Voot-on case?' asked Jones, scarily. We might have sent the Americans Vinnie, but they have returned the favour with interest by donating Caprice, a woman whose craving for fame and attention makes Jones look like a bashful reclusive. In Being Caprice, the bra model and occasional pop singer, wore a concealed camera for 10 days so that we might share in her experiences as a 'celebrity'. The result was strangely compelling in a Warholian kind of way. Not only in the sense of the 15 minutes of fame, but more so in the transfixing banality that marked the artist's factory films. We saw Caprice take yoghurt from the fridge. We saw her go to the lavatory, during which her spy camera paid invasive homage to Sharon Stone in the flashing scene from Basic Instinct (perhaps understandably, she was unable to pee). We heard her singing, blushingly flat. 'I agreed to do this,' she said of wearing the camera, 'because I think a lot of people have a misconception of Caprice's world.' In this looping statement are contained all the ingredients of the modern celebrity: the reluctant self-publicist, the misunderstood 'real' person beneath the media creation, and the self-aggrandisement of the third-person reference. We also saw her do the celebrity rounds - MTV, Hello! , Maxim Woman of the Year Award - and glimpsed the mechanics of the fame game. A story, whose provenance was not explained, had been published claiming that the model was dating Prince Andrew. Caprice coyly denied it: 'If I had kissed him, do you think I'd tell you?' So a nobody did not sleep with a do-nothing and the non-news played and played. The camera appeared well placed on Caprice. We saw what she saw - applauding faceless men and professional sycophants - but seldom saw Caprice herself, lending the suitable impression that no one was really there. It's a depressing thought that a dim-witted prince like Andrew can still command such interest. According to The Real Queen Mother , the position that the Windsors continue to hold in the nation's affections, despite their dysfunction, is largely down to Andrew's grandmother. She, it was argued, 'is the architect of the modern monarchy [who] rebranded the royal product'. It seemed a brave move by C4 to broadcast what looked to be a critical biography in the month of her 100th birthday. But it turned out to be a toothless attack. The prob lem is that the old dear has restricted access to a number of government papers that are thought to show her in a less than glowing light. She has not granted an interview since 1923 and her financial affairs are shrouded in secrecy. Given such impenetrability, the documentary had to rely on a number of biographers, who themselves had little to go on other than rumour and hearsay. These people are quite intriguing insofar as their work appears to be the product of dramatic empathy, rather like that of spiritualists calling up the dead, but they don't make for hard-hitting factual TV. What we learned we already knew: that Queen Elizabeth, as she was before her daughter, was the power behind her husband's throne and a staunch appeaser leading up to the war. And that it was not until the Luftwaffe bombed Buckingham Palace that she was able to reinvent herself and the Royal Family as symbols of British fighting spirit. The most disturbing contribution came from the Rev Anthony Harbottle, chaplain to the Queen. 'Quite simply,' he declared, 'Queen Elizabeth's got a foot in heaven. And that,' he added, as if he had it on good authority from God, 'is true.' Unwittingly, then, these three programmes presented three cornerstones of British culture: thuggery, celebrity, royalty. That's some kind of rallying call. \u0095 Kathryn Flett is away",

I doubt if his idea of nice work extended to service with the Foreign Legion, which is what the title of Claire Denis's fascinating new film, Beau Travail (Good Work), refers to. But the Gershwin brothers' gay friend Cole Porter would have been delighted by the endless lyrical shots of half-dressed legionnaires striking poses in the African desert. </p> <p>Denis, who was born and grew up in French Africa, has a wonderful eye for the beauty of the continent and a complex, unpatronising feeling for the relationship between Europeans and their ex-colonial subjects. Her title invokes P.C. Wren's Beau Geste, the most famous book ever written about the Legion, both as a way of acknowledging that romantic legend and ironically transcending it. </p> <p> Beau Geste was published in 1924, the year that saw the first publication of Billy Budd, the novella Herman Melville wrote in the late 1880s. The interest of this conjunction resides in the fact that Beau Travail is a re-working of Billy Budd at a Foreign Legion outpost at Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden. The desert stands in for the ocean and some choruses from Britten's opera turn up on the soundtrack. </p> <p>In this case, Claggart, the evil master-at-arms, isn't killed, but as the sad Sergeant-Major Galoup (the brogue-faced Denis Lavant), survives to narrate the story from civvy street in Marseilles. The saintly foretopman Billy becomes Private Sentain (Gr\u00e9goire Colin), a handsome, heroic, popular soldier, who invites Galoup's jealousy and is punished by being dumped in the desert with a compass for company. </p> <p>Melville's God-like Captain Vere is turned into Colonel Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor), a paternalistic commander bearing guilty secrets from the Algerian War. An extra layer of meaning is given to the film by the invitation to recall that 40 years ago Subor played the protagonist of Jean-Luc Godard's Le Petit Soldat, also called Bruno Forestier, a deserter from the Algerian War working for a right-wing terrorist organisation in Geneva. </p> <p> Beau Travail is stylistically close to early Godard, and like Le Petit Soldat, it's highly stylised with very little dialogue and a somewhat gnomic philosophical commentary about self-discovery and liberation. 'Maybe freedom begins with remorse,' the lonely Lavant muses. This cinematic poem is seen through the eyes of a tough man trying to understand his feelings and afraid of what he might find out. </p> <p>The images we see are Lavant's memories, sometimes real, sometimes expressions of his anger, anxieties and desires. There's a helicopter crash, a military funeral, parades, combat exercises. </p> <p>The troops - a mixture of Frenchmen, Italians, Russians, Vietnamese and blacks - are always seen in groups. They go over an assault course like athletes in Leni Riefenstahl's Olympics, hang out their washing and iron their uniforms like housewives, engage in calisthenics with their eyes shut, frolic in the sea (a scene that recalls F.T. Prince's Second World War poem, 'Soldiers Bathing'), carry each other around town shoulder-high. </p> <p>The natives view the legionnaires with bemusement, but cinematographer Agn\u00e9s Godard's camera tracks around them with an eye as loving as Robert Mapplethorpe's. The film is a paean to the homo-eroticism of male camaraderie and a study of how someone excluded from that circle might be driven to acts of revenge. </p> <p> Billy Budd also has homo-erotic undertones, but it's a Christian allegory, whereas Beau Travail inclines towards the Roman and the pagan. A riveting movie. </p> <p>There isn't too much to be said about the other films. Terry Winsor's Essex Boys stars Sean Bean (whose real-life Sheffield United tattoo is here doctored to make him a West Ham fan) as a gangster just out of jail and attempting to re-establish himself in the Southend clubs while seeking revenge on the grasses who put him away. </p> <p>Inspired by a famous triple killing a couple of years ago, it's better than most recent British crime movies, doesn't glamorise its low-life characters and makes effective use of muddy locations on the Thames estuary. Charlie Creed-Miles is very good as a dim-witted gangland chauffeur who narrates the film; Tom Wilkinson has some terrible dialogue as an upwardly-mobile crook. </p> <p> In Too Deep, directed by an Australian Michael Rymer, is set in the unfamiliar Cincinnati, but otherwise tells a familiar tale of an undercover cop (Omar Epps) so thoroughly identifying with his false identity that he's torn between the cynical police force he's working for and the ruthless criminals who trust him as a brother. The worst crime committed in the film is to give the great Pam Grier another thankless role. </p> <p>Kurt Vonnegut Jr's novels don't lend themselves to the cinema, but the film versions of Slaughterhouse Five and Mother Night are interesting failures, whereas Alan Rudolph's frenetically unfunny Breakfast of Champions is an unredeemed disaster. </p> <p>This satire on consumerism and the madness of American life, written during the last years of the Vietnam War, makes no sense on the screen. Its producer, Bruce Willis, giving a grotesque performance as a deranged small-town car salesman, leads a fine cast to oblivion. They go over the top like lemmings on speed. </p> <p>A mixture of live action, animation and modelling, Thomas and the Magic Railroad is an Americanised version of the British TV series based on the Reverend W. Awdry's children's books. It's whimsical stuff about the interaction of the railway (sorry, railroad) systems of a real community and a magical one and presumably inspired Andrew Lloyd-Webber to write Starlight Express and call his firm the Really Useful Company. </p> <p>A 'child psychology consultant' is listed in the final credits and one can only guess at the advice he might have provided.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Carl Andre</strong> Whitechapel, London E1, to 27 August </p> <p><strong> Force Fields </strong> Hayward, London SE1, to 17 September </p> <p>Carl Andre has a theory about Equivalent VIII, the most derided work of art ever shown in this country. He believes that the British simply hated the piece because it was made of bricks. Ten dozen ingots of gold, say, and we might have admired his rectilinear array, but bricks to the snobbish British were ineffably 'lower middle-class'. </p> <p>For Andre, it was, and still is, very much a matter of matter. Thirty-four years after Equivalent VIII, his method hasn't changed - the Whitechapel has the basic units, arranged in basic permutations. No bricks, perhaps, but Andre is loyal to his other materials: lead cubes, wooden baulks, tiles of copper and steel. As usual, he invites you to relish their properties, their patina, density and grain and the way these tracts of industrial off-cuts can seem to invoke the 'Great Outdoors'. In short, Andre does what he always did and so the question remains - is it ever enough or just a little too little? </p> <p>Take those metal tiles that Andre has been shuffling for more than three decades. The Whitechapel has a grid of weathered-steel plates, snugly laid and flush with the floor, and a procession of copper squares leading away from the wall. Once you've overcome the Walk/Don't Walk dilemma, the world is at your feet. You can step all over this metal, noticing the stride-sized scale of each unit and the scuffs and scratches left by those who went before you. </p> <p>Andre has said that his ideal sculpture is an infinite road. As trodden by the spectator, these expanses of flattened metal can hardly help suggesting paths and plains, albeit abruptly curtailed. But after the frisson of trespass -ing on art, the chief sensations are purely formal. How tidy, regular and precise are these squares; how neatly Andre once again tiles himself into a corner. </p> <p>In the past, Andre has tried throwing caution to the winds and scattering his stuff on the floor. He does it again here with a haphazard group of small, lead cubes, through which only a mouse could walk. But similar units, stacked in a compact block, knock that random crowd for six with their solid geometry. Andre doesn't thrive when things get out hand; the pleasure of his art lies in its comfortable, reassuring order. </p> <p>Some people thought the order of the bricks was borrowed rather than invented, that they looked more like a regular batch in a builder's yard than the result of protracted creative effort. No matter how irreducibly abstract, Andre's work never sidesteps these real-world associations. His giant matrix of timbers irresistibly proposes architectural ruins; his radial formation, enclosed by pickets, feels as secure as a campfire circle. Stuff about stuff is Andre's diffident claim, but without all these made-to-measure constructions, his stuff would be nothing. </p> <p>So much has been written about his childhood among the shipyards of Massachusetts, followed by a stint on the Pennsylvania railroads, that Andre is routinely pegged as some sort of blue-collar hero, the Bruce Springsteen of American sculpture. </p> <p>Far from hewing art out of the docklands, Andre was a full-on minimalist who liked prime numbers and serial poems and wrote a syllabic opera to be spoken by Stella and De Kooning. The score is on show at the Whitechapel, along with photographs of his works from the Fifties, which look very much like what they were - homages to Brancusi. </p> <p>When Andre stopped trying to invent new forms like Brancusi and began to assemble prefab units instead, critics thought his work was ideological - a truculent statement about what art ought to look like. It doesn't seem that way any more, if indeed it ever did. The art in this show is unimposing, orderly, measured, a little bit pencil-behind-the-ear. It offers its limitations without making demands, knowing that the pleasure it gives come from marginal adjustments of unspectacular materials, repeated over and again. </p> <p>For faster but much more durable pleasure, go to Force Fields at the Hayward Gallery. This is the single largest show of kinetic art ever mounted in Britain and it is, in every sense, a blast from start to finish. It begins with Duchamp's virtual vision machine and ends with a startling display of lightning. In between, every room of the Hayward rattles, hums and vibrates with perpetual motion. </p> <p>Kineticism, as christened by Naum Gabo in 1920, is the overlooked art of the twentieth century. Have you ever seen Grazio Varisco's stunningly volatile mercury paintings, or Julio Le Parc's Continuous Light Cylinders , or Takis's mechanical ballets, choreographed entirely by electro-magnets? Have you even heard of Takis? Much of the work revived in Force Fields has been lying dormant in museum stacks. Practically the only kinetic artists now remembered are Alexander Calder and the marvellous Jean Tinguely, whose boisterous junk-metal contraptions perform their juddering expostulations on several floors of this show. </p> <p>Kineticism isn't a movement, of course, which partly explains its patchy representation in museums. Calder is one of the few artists whose career began and ended with the attempt to realise motion. His graceful mobiles, spheres and vanes balanced on delicate metal axes get their planetary motion purely from currents of passing air. Many other pieces here go back to these original classics, which introduced the element of chance to art. </p> <p>Henri Michaux's mescaline drawings, for example, transmit the unpredictable shivers of hallucination directly on to the page. Yves Klein makes paintings with fire. James Whitney films planets of seething mole cules. The cosmic forms of Calder's mobiles are not the only models of the universe.

      "bodyText": "Carl Andre Whitechapel, London E1, to 27 August Force Fields Hayward, London SE1, to 17 September Carl Andre has a theory about Equivalent VIII, the most derided work of art ever shown in this country. He believes that the British simply hated the piece because it was made of bricks. Ten dozen ingots of gold, say, and we might have admired his rectilinear array, but bricks to the snobbish British were ineffably 'lower middle-class'. For Andre, it was, and still is, very much a matter of matter. Thirty-four years after Equivalent VIII, his method hasn't changed - the Whitechapel has the basic units, arranged in basic permutations. No bricks, perhaps, but Andre is loyal to his other materials: lead cubes, wooden baulks, tiles of copper and steel. As usual, he invites you to relish their properties, their patina, density and grain and the way these tracts of industrial off-cuts can seem to invoke the 'Great Outdoors'. In short, Andre does what he always did and so the question remains - is it ever enough or just a little too little? Take those metal tiles that Andre has been shuffling for more than three decades. The Whitechapel has a grid of weathered-steel plates, snugly laid and flush with the floor, and a procession of copper squares leading away from the wall. Once you've overcome the Walk/Don't Walk dilemma, the world is at your feet. You can step all over this metal, noticing the stride-sized scale of each unit and the scuffs and scratches left by those who went before you. Andre has said that his ideal sculpture is an infinite road. As trodden by the spectator, these expanses of flattened metal can hardly help suggesting paths and plains, albeit abruptly curtailed. But after the frisson of trespass -ing on art, the chief sensations are purely formal. How tidy, regular and precise are these squares; how neatly Andre once again tiles himself into a corner. In the past, Andre has tried throwing caution to the winds and scattering his stuff on the floor. He does it again here with a haphazard group of small, lead cubes, through which only a mouse could walk. But similar units, stacked in a compact block, knock that random crowd for six with their solid geometry. Andre doesn't thrive when things get out hand; the pleasure of his art lies in its comfortable, reassuring order. Some people thought the order of the bricks was borrowed rather than invented, that they looked more like a regular batch in a builder's yard than the result of protracted creative effort. No matter how irreducibly abstract, Andre's work never sidesteps these real-world associations. His giant matrix of timbers irresistibly proposes architectural ruins; his radial formation, enclosed by pickets, feels as secure as a campfire circle. Stuff about stuff is Andre's diffident claim, but without all these made-to-measure constructions, his stuff would be nothing. So much has been written about his childhood among the shipyards of Massachusetts, followed by a stint on the Pennsylvania railroads, that Andre is routinely pegged as some sort of blue-collar hero, the Bruce Springsteen of American sculpture. Far from hewing art out of the docklands, Andre was a full-on minimalist who liked prime numbers and serial poems and wrote a syllabic opera to be spoken by Stella and De Kooning. The score is on show at the Whitechapel, along with photographs of his works from the Fifties, which look very much like what they were - homages to Brancusi. When Andre stopped trying to invent new forms like Brancusi and began to assemble prefab units instead, critics thought his work was ideological - a truculent statement about what art ought to look like. It doesn't seem that way any more, if indeed it ever did. The art in this show is unimposing, orderly, measured, a little bit pencil-behind-the-ear. It offers its limitations without making demands, knowing that the pleasure it gives come from marginal adjustments of unspectacular materials, repeated over and again. For faster but much more durable pleasure, go to Force Fields at the Hayward Gallery. This is the single largest show of kinetic art ever mounted in Britain and it is, in every sense, a blast from start to finish. It begins with Duchamp's virtual vision machine and ends with a startling display of lightning. In between, every room of the Hayward rattles, hums and vibrates with perpetual motion. Kineticism, as christened by Naum Gabo in 1920, is the overlooked art of the twentieth century. Have you ever seen Grazio Varisco's stunningly volatile mercury paintings, or Julio Le Parc's Continuous Light Cylinders , or Takis's mechanical ballets, choreographed entirely by electro-magnets? Have you even heard of Takis? Much of the work revived in Force Fields has been lying dormant in museum stacks. Practically the only kinetic artists now remembered are Alexander Calder and the marvellous Jean Tinguely, whose boisterous junk-metal contraptions perform their juddering expostulations on several floors of this show. Kineticism isn't a movement, of course, which partly explains its patchy representation in museums. Calder is one of the few artists whose career began and ended with the attempt to realise motion. His graceful mobiles, spheres and vanes balanced on delicate metal axes get their planetary motion purely from currents of passing air. Many other pieces here go back to these original classics, which introduced the element of chance to art. Henri Michaux's mescaline drawings, for example, transmit the unpredictable shivers of hallucination directly on to the page. Yves Klein makes paintings with fire. James Whitney films planets of seething mole cules. The cosmic forms of Calder's mobiles are not the only models of the universe. There are neon galaxies, bubble machines, M\u00f6bius strips of glistening Plexiglas and several of Lucio Fontana's slit paintings, which seem to open into teeming space. What counts is not necessarily movement in itself, but the intense expression of energy in time and space. Electricity helps, of course, and Force Fields is full of fascinating experiments - Moholy-Nagy's pierced sculpture, which throws shadow drawings across the wall as it revolves; Hans Haacke's Perspex cube, in which clouds of mutable weather are activated by nothing more than moisture and a thermostat. Duchamp's rotating glass plates were only intended as a rebuke to traditional painting, but the rings of bright air they create are a spectacular thrill for the eye. Like Duchamp, many of these artists regarded kinetic art as a momentary phase, time out of their working lives. Perhaps that's why Force Fields feels so liberating. It is an entrancing show, constantly playing with the sensory perceptions, sprucing up the mind and eye. Catch up with this dynamic art if you can before it is returned to the darkness.",

Not only does no one in Hollywood give a damn about offending British sensibilities, but our own film-makers are proving eager to denigrate their nation's past achievements, especially where the empire is concerned.

Like James Stewart in Shenandoah, the protagonist of The Patriot, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a widowed Southerner with seven children running a prosperous farm without slave labour, whose sons are one by one drawn fatally into the hostilities. Like Clint Eastwood in The Outlaw Josey Wales, Martin becomes a ferocious guerrilla leader out for revenge, when a vicious enemy officer orders the killing of members of his family and the torching of his farm. </p> <p>The references to other pictures include Martin's son interrupting a Sunday morning church service to get volunteers for the militia with results that reverse a parallel scene in the unpatriotic High Noon; and having Martin set up his secret swampland headquarters in the ruins of an old Spanish mission, the fa\u00e7ade of which is identical to the Alamo. </p> <p>Ben Martin becomes a legend as the Ghost, the leader of an irregular force that is assigned to prevent General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) from leading his forces north from South Carolina before the French navy arrives. The character is clearly based on Colonel John Singleton Mosby, the Confederate guerrilla commander from Virginia in the Civil War who was dubbed the Grey Ghost, and the film's central thrust seems to be right. </p> <p>The rigidly disciplined British redcoats, skilfully led by officers versed in the art of classical warfare, excelled in pitched battles. The colonists were a new kind of people, unruly but at one with the land, and they were at their best, indeed almost invincible, when engaging in brief surprise skirmishes, rather like the Vietcong running rings round the US Army in Vietnam. </p> <p>The moviemakers, however, make the same mistake they attribute to the British - of failing to do justice to the enemy. Cornwallis, for all the tributes paid to his general ship, is a jokey aristocrat without the style or dignity that Bernard Shaw gave to General Burgoyne in The Devil's Disciple. 'These rustics are so inept,' he says. 'It nearly takes the honour out of victory - nearly.' </p> <p>Martin scores off him as easily as Leslie Howard does off the high command in Pimpernel Smith, and Martin's personal enemy, Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs), resembles a snarling Nazi sadist from a wartime propaganda film. Admittedly, as in Saving Private Ryan, we see the revolutionary colonists committing war crimes. But like the shooting of surrendering Germans on D-Day, they're done in the heat of battle. </p> <p>Tavington's atrocities, on the other hand, are carefully calculated and give him lip-smacking satisfaction. One of them, as several historians have pointed out, derives from an infamous SS mass killing in France in 1944. </p> <p>Running through The Patriot are three emotive visual symbols. The first is the tattered, blood-splattered Stars and Stripes that Martin's son stuffs into his saddlebag and which after his death is carried into battle by his father. The second is the pair of Great Danes called Jupiter and Mars that are captured from Cornwallis by Ben and subsequently change their allegiance from the Crown to the American democrat. The third is the collection of lead soldiers that belonged to Ben's 15-year-old son, the first to die; before every major battle, the father melts down one of the soldiers to make a bullet. </p> <p>Emmerich and Rodat, however, are belt-and-braces men. Everything you see is backed up by Williams's music and by uplifting speeches. 'Stay the course' is the film's oft-repeated refrain, and Martin is told: 'Nothing can replace your sons, but if you win you can justify their sacrifice.'

It's a discreet box on the outside, with an explosive punch inside. Michael Wilford, the embassy's architect, has complied with all Berlin's rules. He has designed a stone-faced building precisely 22 metres or six floors high. It has what looks like a pitched roof. The street fa\u00e7ade has a regular pattern of conventional window openings. It is built to the old street line of the Wilhelmstrasse even though the street itself had long since vanished. It was on this site that Britain had its embassy until the moment in 1939 when the last British ambassador to the Third Reich locked the doors and slipped away home. Wilford has gashed a giant wedge out of the stone wall to make it clear that it is not just part of the street, it is a building with a distinctive presence of its own.

Most of the work takes places in small cellular rooms. And yet we expect them to feel as special as the palace that Wellington acquired for Britain in Paris. Wilford has dealt with this by making two great public spaces at the heart of the embassy, one external, the other internal, in which a number of brightly coloured objects seem to float as if freely suspended, and wrapping the neccessary offices around them. There is a giant purple drum that erupts through the stone fa\u00e7ade to register on the street, and which contains a conference room.

Then you move inside, and as you ascend the generous stone staircase toward the internal court, a vivid red wedge hovers overhead. It actually contains the plant room, but it feels like a giant piece of sculpture, setting the scene for Tony Cragg's two melting stone chess men at the top of the stairs, one of a series of specially commissioned art works in the embassy. </p> <p>Wilford calls the internal public courtyard a winter garden, carefully using a word that suggests the nineteenth century. But actually it's a space full of dynamic shapes and colours that seems to belong to the heroic days of the modern movement. At its centre is a pink column holding up the steel and glass roof. The last thing that Wilford wanted to do was follow the spirit of the Berlin rules, and build an evocation of the nineteenth-century embassy. </p> <p>Wilford's determination to subvert the rules is amply justified by the neighbouring Adalon Hotel that wraps itself around two sides of the embassy. It is made of stone, it has a classical fa\u00e7ade, and plays no tricks.

      "body": "<p>All eyes were on the the main acts - Paul Weller, Moloko - and that was before Macy Gray and entourage turned up unannounced in the audience of a Later With Jools Holland recording last April. No one took much notice of a young guy setting up in the middle of the studio until he was on camera, melting drop-dead R&amp;B vocals ('I got somethin' to say, I got somethin' to say... all ri-i-i-ght') over a few acoustic guitar notes played by a guy perched alongside. Then a super-smooth, rapid-fire, sing-song narrative about getting down with the girl next door that shuffled into an irresistible off-the-beat chorus every time her parents came home and ruined things. It sounded like nothing else. Macy was straining to get a closer look. </p> <p>By the end of the week, 18-year-old Craig David's debut solo single, 'Fill Me In', had gone straight to No1, and if you still didn't know that the off-the-beat bassline was two-step, it didn't really matter; you could still attempt to sing along. David was hailed as a crossover messiah, not least because he was the same Craig David who co-wrote Artful Dodger's massive garage anthem 'Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta!)', then sang his name all over it like a rubber stamp. The track burst into the mainstream at No 2 last Christmas behind Sir Cliff's more irritating 'Millennium Prayer'. </p> <p>Craig wrote 'Fill Me In' in his bedroom in Southampton. 'Like, in a small confined space writing a song to then be embraced by thousands of people, millions of people, it's like I can't believe it,' he looks into the middle distance, hands turned upwards, still not believing it. 'It's such a mad sensation - it's like, when I was No 1 and I went back to my bedroom, I said Craig, you're No 1 in the UK! It blows you away. How can I be No 1, yeah?' </p> <p>We're at his PR office in west London (orange walls, beanbags) where no one is questioning that he can be No 1 - over and over. It's a great story: underground David beating the major label Goliaths (he's signed to the small Wildstar label). UK garage, born in the USA, about to become Britain's next great export. 'We've adapted it in a totally different direction,' David explains. 'When you try to play it in America, they're like, what is this? It's still got R&amp;B roots, it's very song-based, but it's got this drum pattern that's unfamiliar.' (Macy 'can't wait' for him to come over.) </p> <p>He is zinging with health, relaxed, charming, has a ready answer for everything and hasn't been in the game long enough to know that a sunny, open disposition in interview situations is not normal. The trademark beard makes him look older than he seems to feel. 'I'm still only 19,' he says, more than once. </p> <p>His hair has been freshly twisted and baked hard into a perfect lattice, his own invention. 'Touch it,' he says cheerfully. He's wearing clothes chosen for him by his stylist. Today it's white Adidas trainers, turn-up jeans, a sage-coloured suede shirt (he has to look down to check). </p> <p>His debut album, Born To Do It ( produced by Mark Hill, half of Artful Dodger), is released next month and has something for everyone: Spanish guitar, tasteful strings, great melodies, storyboard lyrics, two-step basslines and that gorgeous, athletic voice. It will undoubtedly go straight to No 1. 'I think it represents me perfectly,' David says, job well done. 'Nineteen years of Craig David on the planet... everything. Thinking you're in love but you're not, breaking up, going out with someone, not, then in the clubs being an MC, a DJ... those situations are very close to my heart.' This third-person Craig pops up frequently. ('What I'm saying in my songs is Craig David deep inside,' he tells me; and 'on the next album I'll be Craig David on another level'). </p> <p>In fact, there seem to be quite a lot of Craig Davids out there, what with all the namechecks he gives himself on his records. 'It's not being vain,' he explains - it's his ident. 'I don't go out and decide to say Craig David, it just kind of flows. Certain key words, like \"break it down\", \"this is how we do it\", they'll always end up on my tracks.' </p> <p>Then there's the Craig David in his songs who, in typical R&amp;B style, sees women as passive sex objects; beautiful ladies, special ladies with beautiful bodies. 'I know what you mean,' he says with a little impatient frown. 'That's why it's important that when people see the first album they realise that, OK, the guy's only 19, he's produced an album that's showing his youth.' His new single, 'Seven Days', goes: 'Met this girl on Monday/ Took her for a drink on Tuesday/ We made love on Wednesday/ And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday/ We chilled on Sunday.' In UK garage, settee rhymes with jacuzzi and everybody drinks Mo\u00ebt. </p> <p>And there's the Craig David who's being groomed for fame. The hair twists only last two or three days before they have to be redone. To avoid squashing them flat in the meantime, he has to sleep with the side of his face on his arm; he demonstrates, like something with a broken wing. </p> <p>John, his manager, a former Army fitness trainer, comes in at 3pm with Craig's food. 'This is rockin',' says the singer, peering into a bowl of beige gloop. Together John and Craig are watching their carbohydrates and proteins. This is week six: four hardboiled eggs (minus yolks), plain toast, no salt ('pepper's cool'), carb lunch, protein drink three times a day, then later two pieces of chicken with onions - 'and that's it, really'. He can drink as much water as he wants. The Mo\u00ebt's off. </p> <p>Craig grew up listening to Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. His mum loved Terence Trent D'Arby, 'and was kicking with The Osmonds big time'. His dad, from Grenada, listened to reggae lovers' rock. His nan's from Sheffield, his mum's dad was Jewish. He is, he says, 'a blend of cultures and vibes'. </p> <p>His parents split up when he was young (he has a younger half-sister), leaving him in effect an only child - 'which is so good because you get spoilt so, so much'. He hasn't officially moved out of his mum's house yet - 'she's my best friend' - and still rings her up to find things in his bottom drawer. 'My bedroom I want to keep as my shrine,' he explains, 'because that's where everything's been nurtured. All my creative juices flow out of my bedroom.' </p> <p>Academically smart, he was two years into a college engineering course before songwriting won the day. (Allegedly you can't study music in Southampton.) David's songs are beautifully constructed: drop you right into a situation, dialogue, plot development. He leaves the endings open. 'Your English needs to be quite cool,' he says lightly, 'but you don't have to stick to any rules. You can say \"flavour\", for example... \"desire\", right?

      "bodyText": "All eyes were on the the main acts - Paul Weller, Moloko - and that was before Macy Gray and entourage turned up unannounced in the audience of a Later With Jools Holland recording last April. No one took much notice of a young guy setting up in the middle of the studio until he was on camera, melting drop-dead R&amp;B vocals ('I got somethin' to say, I got somethin' to say... all ri-i-i-ght') over a few acoustic guitar notes played by a guy perched alongside. Then a super-smooth, rapid-fire, sing-song narrative about getting down with the girl next door that shuffled into an irresistible off-the-beat chorus every time her parents came home and ruined things. It sounded like nothing else. Macy was straining to get a closer look. By the end of the week, 18-year-old Craig David's debut solo single, 'Fill Me In', had gone straight to No1, and if you still didn't know that the off-the-beat bassline was two-step, it didn't really matter; you could still attempt to sing along. David was hailed as a crossover messiah, not least because he was the same Craig David who co-wrote Artful Dodger's massive garage anthem 'Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta!)', then sang his name all over it like a rubber stamp. The track burst into the mainstream at No 2 last Christmas behind Sir Cliff's more irritating 'Millennium Prayer'. Craig wrote 'Fill Me In' in his bedroom in Southampton. 'Like, in a small confined space writing a song to then be embraced by thousands of people, millions of people, it's like I can't believe it,' he looks into the middle distance, hands turned upwards, still not believing it. 'It's such a mad sensation - it's like, when I was No 1 and I went back to my bedroom, I said Craig, you're No 1 in the UK! It blows you away. How can I be No 1, yeah?' We're at his PR office in west London (orange walls, beanbags) where no one is questioning that he can be No 1 - over and over. It's a great story: underground David beating the major label Goliaths (he's signed to the small Wildstar label). UK garage, born in the USA, about to become Britain's next great export. 'We've adapted it in a totally different direction,' David explains. 'When you try to play it in America, they're like, what is this? It's still got R&amp;B roots, it's very song-based, but it's got this drum pattern that's unfamiliar.' (Macy 'can't wait' for him to come over.) He is zinging with health, relaxed, charming, has a ready answer for everything and hasn't been in the game long enough to know that a sunny, open disposition in interview situations is not normal. The trademark beard makes him look older than he seems to feel. 'I'm still only 19,' he says, more than once. His hair has been freshly twisted and baked hard into a perfect lattice, his own invention. 'Touch it,' he says cheerfully. He's wearing clothes chosen for him by his stylist. Today it's white Adidas trainers, turn-up jeans, a sage-coloured suede shirt (he has to look down to check). His debut album, Born To Do It ( produced by Mark Hill, half of Artful Dodger), is released next month and has something for everyone: Spanish guitar, tasteful strings, great melodies, storyboard lyrics, two-step basslines and that gorgeous, athletic voice. It will undoubtedly go straight to No 1. 'I think it represents me perfectly,' David says, job well done. 'Nineteen years of Craig David on the planet... everything. Thinking you're in love but you're not, breaking up, going out with someone, not, then in the clubs being an MC, a DJ... those situations are very close to my heart.' This third-person Craig pops up frequently. ('What I'm saying in my songs is Craig David deep inside,' he tells me; and 'on the next album I'll be Craig David on another level'). In fact, there seem to be quite a lot of Craig Davids out there, what with all the namechecks he gives himself on his records. 'It's not being vain,' he explains - it's his ident. 'I don't go out and decide to say Craig David, it just kind of flows. Certain key words, like \"break it down\", \"this is how we do it\", they'll always end up on my tracks.' Then there's the Craig David in his songs who, in typical R&amp;B style, sees women as passive sex objects; beautiful ladies, special ladies with beautiful bodies. 'I know what you mean,' he says with a little impatient frown. 'That's why it's important that when people see the first album they realise that, OK, the guy's only 19, he's produced an album that's showing his youth.' His new single, 'Seven Days', goes: 'Met this girl on Monday/ Took her for a drink on Tuesday/ We made love on Wednesday/ And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday/ We chilled on Sunday.' In UK garage, settee rhymes with jacuzzi and everybody drinks Mo\u00ebt. And there's the Craig David who's being groomed for fame. The hair twists only last two or three days before they have to be redone. To avoid squashing them flat in the meantime, he has to sleep with the side of his face on his arm; he demonstrates, like something with a broken wing. John, his manager, a former Army fitness trainer, comes in at 3pm with Craig's food. 'This is rockin',' says the singer, peering into a bowl of beige gloop. Together John and Craig are watching their carbohydrates and proteins. This is week six: four hardboiled eggs (minus yolks), plain toast, no salt ('pepper's cool'), carb lunch, protein drink three times a day, then later two pieces of chicken with onions - 'and that's it, really'. He can drink as much water as he wants. The Mo\u00ebt's off. Craig grew up listening to Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. His mum loved Terence Trent D'Arby, 'and was kicking with The Osmonds big time'. His dad, from Grenada, listened to reggae lovers' rock. His nan's from Sheffield, his mum's dad was Jewish. He is, he says, 'a blend of cultures and vibes'. His parents split up when he was young (he has a younger half-sister), leaving him in effect an only child - 'which is so good because you get spoilt so, so much'. He hasn't officially moved out of his mum's house yet - 'she's my best friend' - and still rings her up to find things in his bottom drawer. 'My bedroom I want to keep as my shrine,' he explains, 'because that's where everything's been nurtured. All my creative juices flow out of my bedroom.' Academically smart, he was two years into a college engineering course before songwriting won the day. (Allegedly you can't study music in Southampton.) David's songs are beautifully constructed: drop you right into a situation, dialogue, plot development. He leaves the endings open. 'Your English needs to be quite cool,' he says lightly, 'but you don't have to stick to any rules. You can say \"flavour\", for example... \"desire\", right? The two - flavour, desire - kind of match. But then you can flip it and have flava; then you're into ta and...' He's trying to think of a rhyme. 'Flava, flava... er, that wasn't a good example but...' If he's in a vibe, he'll stay up all night, write on his day off: 'It's like a god-given gift that I've actually been able to go out and sing my songs. If I couldn't sing tomorrow, I'd still write songs cos I'm passionate about that.' His role model is obvious: 'Yeah, Mr R Kelly himself.

      "body": "<p>The Royal Opera House is a notoriously leaky vessel, generating more rumours than Millbank. The most persistent is that any day now arts supremo Brian McMaster will take over the sinking ship, batten down the hatches and guide it safely into port.</p> <p>Like most rumours, it's based on a scintilla of truth. McMaster has been in the frame to run Britain's most prestigious and troubled arts organisation on more than one occasion. His credentials are, after all, well-nigh perfect. He was at the helm of English National Opera, paving the way for its famed 'powerhouse years' and he transformed Welsh National Opera.</p> <p>He's director of the Edinburgh International Festival, arguably the most influential arts job in Britain. What's more, he's been there since 1991, so surely it's time for a change? And guess what? He has just renegotiated his contract. So, will he be heading south to replace Michael Kaiser, who is off to Washington in December?</p> <p>'I feel a bit guilty about hogging this job for so long but it's such a good one,' he smiles. Covent Garden's board is going to have to look further afield. McMaster is staying put in Edinburgh until 2003. And who can blame him? Quite apart from having no wish to mediate between the contradictory demands of a board seeking kudos, a government demanding access and a hostile press, he is more than happy in a far less controversial post doing what could be described as spending three weeks a year living above the shop and the rest of the time going shopping.</p> <p>He winces at the analogy. 'Shopping is a pretty emotive term,' he says, guardedly. He does concede, however, that part of his job is about trawling the international arts supermarket, plucking choice items from the shelves.</p> <p>'Except that it isn't really like that. What we try to do is put on 150 performances that are in some way special.' So while he has grabbed New York City Ballet, their first appearance in Britain for 11 years, he has also been instrumental in initiating work like the Tim Albery/Hildegard Bechtler Ring Cycle he's beginning with Scottish Opera. Fresher still is the ambitious production of The Barbaric Comedies , by Spanish playwright, Valle-Incl\u00e1n.</p> <p>'You may not have heard of it, but it is a massive theatre piece that will talk to everybody,' he announces confidently. It is also a perfect illustration of Festival commissioning. One evening of three plays in four-and-a-half hours, it's a co-production with Dublin's Abbey Theatre. Ireland's national theatre would not normally be able to undertake anything on this scale.</p> <p>All of this is an extension of his trailblazing time at Welsh National Opera. McMaster catapulted the company into the top rank not only by raising musical standards, especially his development of the tremendous chorus, but also by his theatrical savoir-faire . No one else in Britain had the foresight to encourage what turned out to be a massively influential generation of European directors, including Peter Stein, Patrice Chereau and Luc Bondy.</p> <p>That sort of international collaboration is still rare, an absence which McMaster finds puzzling. He's too canny to point the finger but you don't have to look further than present Stratford and South Bank regimes to guess which way his mind is moving.</p> <p>The mere mention of that calibre of names is usually accompanied by words like 'challenging' and 'cutting-edge', but McMaster's language is mercifully free of such arts-speak. The nearest he gets is when the conversation turns towards the idea of the Festival's role within the culture as a whole. 'When I get depressed about dumbing-down, as we all do, I think, hell, last year I put on the most radical Festival I've ever done. Dumbing-up, if you will. That was the unofficial blueprint. And we got away with it.'</p> <p>Is that symptomatic of a developing taste? 'I swing a bit. Someone said to me that theatre is only showing signs of life because TV is so bad at the moment. Maybe that's true but there is something in the air. Look at Tate Modern.' He's right. Last week, even the Daily Mirror called on its front page for more investment in the arts.</p> <p>Unpopular though it may be, he's a devout believer in excellence. 'If you give someone a real experience, they will really respond to it. The problem is that those who play to the lowest common denominator have the resources to market it in a way that others haven't. But any time you give people the chance, they actually discover they want something that's better than something less good.'</p> <p>Which makes him a populariser, rather than a populist. 'The trouble is there really is good and bad. There is work which is second rate. I would rather people went to see Madam Butterfly in a theatre with an orchestra in the pit with proper sound and real singers rather than in a giant arena where you can't focus on what is essential to the experience.'</p> <p>Not that he can afford to be wholly idealistic. His \u00a36 million budget consists of \u00a32m of public money from the city and the Scottish Arts Council, \u00a31.6m in sponsorship with the rest coming from the box-office. 'I arrived with all those splendid ideas about marketing and the then Lord Provost said, \"In 1947, the Festival sold 70 per cent of tickets; in 1991, we sold 70 per cent and in 2047 we'll sell 70 per cent.\" Last year, we actually managed 76 per cent. But we like it like that. We want people to be able to come in read and talk about what's good and then be able to buy a ticket.' That's the Edinburgh experience.'</p> <p>Beneath his confidence, there are signs of strain. Two years ago, Hilary Strong, then director of the Fringe, parted company and shifted the Fringe to the beginning of August. Whichever way you slice it, the entire Festival now runs a dangerous five-and-a-half weeks. McMaster has always favoured later dates. August means holidays and he's keen to programme during Scottish term-time, which starts earlier than in England, in order to be able to reach all classes of Scottish children, not just the middle-class ones whose parents take them to arts events.</p> <p>He regards the Festival sprawl as a real problem. 'It's a huge additional expense for newspapers. And then there's the cost of servicing the city for all that time.' He's confident that his robust final week, including Nederlands Dans Theater and Peter Zadek's Hamlet , will be juicy enough attractions but he worries about low attendances for the Fringe in early August. 'It may hit young companies very hard.'</p> <p>Strong's belief that the audiences for the International and Fringe Festivals were mutually exclusive suggests a high and low culture split. Yet that runs counter to the very notion of the barrier-breaking atmosphere of the Festival, a holiday where you find yourself at events and shows which you might never normally dream of watching. It certainly worked on McMaster. He went to Edinburgh at 15 and decided that he wanted to return every summer, little imagining his current job.</p> <p>'When I was young, I used to be in a theatre almost every night. Now it's more difficult to get the knowledge. Students have lower grants and debts to worry about. I came from a poor family but it cost me 3/6 and I was earning \u00a33 a week so I could do it. I slept outside Covent Garden to get tickets for Callas's Tosca, but so was the now director of English National Opera and the now director of the National Gallery.'</p> <p>That level of knowledge is grossly undervalued when it comes to senior arts appointments. In the Eighties and Nineties, arts organisations were pushed towards business models of transferable skills, as if product knowledge was instantly acquirable. 'Eighteen months ago, I talked to the chairman of three of the top FTSE-listed companies. He told me that through his experience of sponsorship, he had come to realise that very few businesses were run as well as the arts. You need real experience. There are an awful lot of cowpats to fall into.'</p> <p>Which ones has he trodden in? 'Oh God, you don't talk about those. Not all the risks we've taken have come off but you don't dwell on them because that imperils taking risks in the future.' That reply - judicious, pragmatic and idealisitic - distills the qualities which have kept him in his post for so long. That and his optimism. 'There is nothing worse than being bored in a theatre. But go to a performance that really works... I've always believed if you staged farce like great Chekhov with real psychological perspective it could be fantastic.'</p> <p>He feels no need to be defensive about his role as an evangelist for the arts. 'I went to a dinner and the youngish man on my right turned to me and said, \"I'm really pleased to meet you. My wife used to sing in the Festival chorus.\" I said, \"Doesn't she still?\" \"No, she died of cancer a year ago.\"'</p> <p>It transpired that he and his wife had attended the chorus's performance last year of Mahler's Second Symphony, her favourite piece, with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Simon Rattle.</p> <p>'He was quite certain that the prospect of that performance kept her alive for a few extra weeks. She died the week afterwards. If that's what it's about, that's why we do the bloody job.'</p>",

      "byline": "Moderated by Mim Udovitch",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When it comes to nudity, actresses are just like you and me - self-conscious, vain, insecure, eager to please and sometimes miserable. Except that when they take their clothes off, they have to do it in front of the people they work with, knowing that they have little if any control over how the images of their naked bodies - which will then be projected on to 30ft screens in front of millions of complete strangers - will ultimately be presented in the context of the finished project. And that their families will probably see them. And their friends. And that owing to the miracle of video rental, the internet and enormous media interest, these images will be preserved, if not for ever, at least for long enough that whatever the actresses' original thoughts about getting naked were, they'll probably have second, third and fourth thoughts about it.</p> <p>On the other hand, being a hot body can be extremely lucrative, and even career-making. It is increasingly a job requisite with, for example, actresses in their late teens and early twenties, like those in American Beauty, appearing topless as a matter of course, a circumstance that would have caused at least a mild stir 20 years ago. Nevertheless, other than a pro-forma disclaimer that the script called for it or a rare, and usually roundly mocked, claim of pride in nudity (think Demi Moore) or exploitation (think about the raised-eyebrow doubts that greeted Sharon Stone's contention that she was tricked into showing more than she knew in Basic Instinct), the women themselves rarely get a chance to say how they feel about this state of affairs. No one wants to look like a braggart or a whiner and, anyway, it's embarrassing to talk about.</p> <p>Rosie Perez, whose first film role - in Do the Right Thing - had such a memorable nude scene that a decade later she's still living it down (or up), convened a round table of some of her friends and colleagues, inviting a reporter to participate, to talk about the pressures, rewards and plain facts about getting naked in public.</p> <p><b>Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump, Fearless):</b> I initially wanted to do this round table because of my stepdaughter, because she told me that there was a website where I was nude. And it just brought up a lot of questions, because now that I'm older and married and I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter, and she sees me naked on a website, I'm like: how am I going to respond to her? Am I going to say, 'Oh that's a horrible thing?'</p> <p>I really had to think, 'Wait a minute, do I really feel good about what I did? Do I feel embarrassed in front of her because I did those things?' And then I started reaching even further, and I remember there was a point in my career where I actually pulled back, because everybody wanted me to do these movies where I'm taking off my clothes and sassafrassing around, and then I found myself covering up, and I was like, 'Well, that's not me, either.' It's just that the whole entertainment industry forces you to deal with the issue of sexuality, and of your own sexuality.</p> <p>I see explicit covers on magazines, and they're getting even more explicit, and it's like, 'Are women being empowered, or is this just what sells magazines?' Are they feeling pressured, or have they really come into themselves and are saying, 'I am woman, hear me roar?'</p> <p><b>Mim Udovitch:</b> Maybe we should start by going around the room and talking about your first, or your most memorable, experiences while doing nude scenes.</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> My first experience, of course, was Do the Right Thing. And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think - that's what was really bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I don't want to do this. I felt like Irene Cara in Fame. It was like, 'Wait a minute, I feel so wimpy, this is not who I am.' So that was my first experience, and it was horrible.</p> <p>But then I went and took my clothes off again for White Men Can't Jump! But that was because it was totally my decision, I felt totally comfortable, the director was so cool and Woody Harrelson was like, 'Well, whatever you want is cool with me.' So there I felt empowered by it. But with Do the Right Thing it was like, 'Now I'm the object, here's the shot.' And the reason why I cried was not so much because I felt violated as because I was angry at myself, because I wanted to say: 'Say something! Get up!' So that's how I felt violated. I felt like I violated myself.</p> <p><b>Sarah Jessica Parker(Sex and the City, State and Main):</b> Well, I've never done nudity. And I don't do nudity, and for no particular moral reason. It's not a judgment, and I'm very admiring of those people who feel comfortable enough to do it. The irony is that I come from a very politically progressive family. But I've just never felt comfortable, and I've always felt that I could convince whoever had an idea that nudity might be good in a scene that it wasn't. I was thinking of all these stories - not that a lot of people try to get me to take my clothes off - but in a work environment, when it's been discussed, there are some stories that are really awful, and in retrospect I felt that it was good old-fashioned Hollywood sexual harassment, where I didn't realise that was what was happening.</p> <p>Generally speaking, you're the only woman around, there's just men everywhere you look. I remember one experience in particular. They thought that I was going to do a nude scene the next day and they started joking about it the night before, saying, 'Oh, tomorrow Sarah Jessica's getting nude,' and it was very late at night, and everybody was laughing, and I said, 'No, I'm not,' and they said, 'Yes, you are.' And then there were phone calls made to my agent, and mean things were said. You know: 'We shouldn't have hired her. We should have hired so and so.' And I kept thinking, 'Oh, please God, fire me.' I mean the movie was bad anyway. It was a really awful situation. So I didn't do it, but the fellow playing opposite me did - he was totally nude in the scene, and it was just as awful as it gets. I thought, 'Well, that's his only means of making me feel uncomfortable now, for him to be nude because he knows that for me this is awkward.'</p> <p><b>Udovitch: </b> So your contracts specify no nude scenes?</p> <p><b>Parker:</b> Yes. And now that I'm married, not that there's any kind of dictatorship in the house, but he doesn't even really like to see a photograph that is meant to be titillating or whatever, it makes him feel uncomfortable. And I think I'm much more conscious of that, too, now - like what I do at work, too, even a scene with a bra and skirt.</p> <p><b>Sandra Bernhard (The King of Comedy, I'm Still Here\u0085 Damn It):</b> For me, any time I've used nudity in my work, I've always felt strangely detached from it, and it's always been on a lot of different levels that it's worked for me, and had sort of a multipurpose emotional and cultural reference. So I've never felt in any way, shape or form exploited or used, because it's always been pretty much my decision. Even in King of Comedy, where I stripped down for Jerry Lewis, it's such a perfect metaphor for any woman's darkest fantasy. It's always been, I don't know, kind of a kick for me - having grown up being really skinny and, like, not particularly confident, for me it has always felt really liberating.</p> <p><b>Perez: </b> That's how I felt for White Men Can't Jump.</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> But you're a little bit more bodacious than I am, so I'm sure your whole life you've kind of been looked at in a much more sexual way, and ogled. Also, when you do comedy, you're usually alone onstage, so you're calling the shots. And if you're not self-deprecating, you just don't get into that whole sort of I'm-being-completely-exploited-by-the-patriarchy thing. And in terms of my own daughter, we kind of always wander around naked together, so it's pretty open and relaxed. I think it's something I missed growing up. That's not my mother's thing, she's not sexual, so for me it was kind of like a new experience to be sexual and express it through my work. Because in my own life I'm sometimes completely detached from it as well.</p> <p><b>Sarita Choudhury (Mississippi Masala, Kama Sutra):</b> My first time nude was with a woman director, so I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't. I got my period just before.</p> <p><b>Debi Mazar (GoodFellas, The Insider):</b> Me, too!</p> <p><b>Choudhury:</b> Really? And so I didn't want to come down from the room - it was horrific. Usually, though, I feel really comfortable during the scene, and then I hate it when the movie is going to come out. My family is conservative, and that is hard. I don't know why it's so liberating when I'm doing it and then\u0085 I guess it just shows, and it's weird, that an experience can be normal, but when you think about it in the context of family and tradition, then it's not.</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> It's funny. With family, I don't know what to say any more. My father calls and he says: 'Hello, baby! Do I see this one?' 'No.' 'OK, bye!'</p> <p><b>Amber Valletta (What Lies Beneath, Drop Back Ten):</b> Well, none of the films I've done were nude. But one of the first modelling jobs I got that was big, that was a break, I got for French Elle - and in France nudity is not a big deal. I went on the job because one of the two models got sick, and the other one was Claudia Schiffer. Obviously I was kind of the nobody, so she got all the work - it was a week in the Seychelles, and they were like, 'Well, we'll shoot a couple of covers on you when we get a chance.' I was 17, maybe 18, and they asked me to take off my top for one of these pictures. And the picture is of me like this [crosses arms over breasts and freezes] and I look so uncomfortable. I had never taken off my clothes for a photographer before, and he was particularly mean, he was very macho, and it didn't make it any easier. And I kind of regret ever doing that for them, even though the photo never ran, because it was not something I felt good about. I think for one, I was too young, I wasn't even that sexual. Nor did it make any sense for the photo.</p> <p>Since then I have done a few nude pictures and I'm very, very careful about it - like I know the number of nude pictures that are out. But then there are runway photos that are on the internet. This one kid came up to me and said, 'Can you sign this?' And I looked, and it was a totally sheer top - you could see my breasts like it was broad daylight. And you just never think, because it's for a fashion show, that those pictures might get cut for\u0085</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> Celebrity Skin!</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> That was the website!</p> <p><b>Valletta:</b> Actually, I've seen it twice now, so now I am even careful on runways, but sometimes you just say, 'I don't care, I feel good.' But the first one was definitely uncomfortable.</p> <p><b>Udovitch:</b> The difference maybe is you're in a position now where you can say no, and before, you really\u0085</p> <p><b>Valletta:</b> I couldn't. I was trying to do a job, and I was with a model who was already made, and she was going to do the picture if I wasn't, probably, and maybe not naked, but it would have been one more for her and one less for me. And when you're young and naive\u0085 it's not that you're not given a choice, but you maybe don't know what your choices are.</p> <p><b>Udovitch:</b> Everyone has said that power is an issue. Sandra has said she's the most comfortable, and she's the one who has the most power over what she does. And it's funny what Sarah Jessica said, about the male actor in the love scene, that male nudity expresses power the other way, you know, it imposes power.</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> For me, I basically had hippie parents, and I've always been a very sexual person and OK with people seeing my body - so my first experience being naked, I gave full nudity. I read it, I discussed it with the director, we discussed how we were going to shoot it - it was going to be very Bu\u00f1uel-like, starting with the tip of my heel - and we had it all mapped out, and I felt, Wow, this is going to be really cool. It was my first big studio lead. It was called Money for Nothing. It had John Cusack, Benicio Del Toro, all these great actors. And then, at the end of the day, it was completely gratuitous, like they just showed me sitting on him, frontal. It wasn't artistic, it wasn't beautiful, it wasn't even a good angle for me. And I just felt like, 'Damn, there's really nothing you can do about it, because you never know how they're going to cut it up.' Now, with love scenes, often if I read a script and I don't trust a director, I have a clause - no nudity.</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> That's something that's really bizarre, when you get to that point in the Hollywood system where you have to negotiate certain body parts.</p> <p><b>Choudhury:</b> Oh, completely! It's absurd!</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> It's like, No below nipple, no crotch shot, only side, no frontal, or in the frontal, only stomach\u0085</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> And no crack. Mm-hmm.</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> Right, no crack. They literally have these terms, and you sit there thinking, What the hell is going on? It drives me crazy to the point where I want to say, 'No, you can't show nothing,' not because I don't believe in it, but because it's so absurd.</p> <p><b>Parker:</b> It's worth noting that we feel we need protection with this, whereas everything else that we're told as women of a certain generation is, 'We are as good, we're equal, we can have the whole thing,' and we still feel we need somebody, a manager or an agent or a big, burly somebody, to say no.</p> <p><b>Udovitch:</b> But then some women who have chosen to take their clothes off - and examples that spring to mind are Demi Moore, Madonna, Elizabeth Berkley, obviously a big range of performers doing very different kinds of work - but they were all clobbered, in a way that it's hard to believe anybody deserves for anything they do in entertainment.</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> Did it hurt them? No.</p> <p><b>Parker:</b> I think it hurt Elizabeth Berkley.</p> <p><b>Choudhury:</b> I think it hurt Demi Moore. I think it hurt her big time.</p> <p><b>Udovitch:</b> I think it hurt Madonna in the short term, also.</p> <p><b>Parker:</b> Perhaps it's not fair to prognosticate about Elizabeth Berkley, but it's an easy example, in a way. I looked at Showgirls, and although I don't know what she was thinking, what it felt like in the audience, she wanted to be in a big movie, and it wasn't good, the script wasn't good. But look how different Gina Gershon was - she seemed very self-aware and ironic.</p> <p><b>Udovitch:</b> I think Elizabeth Berkley was different in that she was very young, and she just did what the director told her and, as it happened, it didn't work.</p> <p><b>Perez [to Bernhard]:</b> What's the matter? Do you not agree, lady?</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> Nothing's the matter. I have nothing to say about Showgirls. I just think it's a campy, funny film, and I think anybody in that role would have probably been in the same position. It was an asinine role, the film was completely absurd and, I mean, it didn't even capture Vegas. But it was brilliant, it was hysterical, it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen! There's no way you can take that movie seriously.</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> I went in to audition on that movie. I knew it wasn't good when I read it, and I thought, 'Man, I'll go in, and I'll work it, I'll use my sexuality because I can.'</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> Did you go in for Gina's role?</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> Yeah. And when I walk into an audition, I do use my sexuality to get a part, to put it out there, to convince them.</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> If you're going in and using your sexuality to get a part, how can you ever get offended if they want you to be nude?</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> I don't. But I decide when I get exploited now.</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> That's fair.</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> I figure I've done enough movies now that I know angles, I know lighting, I know\u0085</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> It's all about looking beautiful for you, I think.</p> <p><b>Mazar:</b> No! I look ugly in a lot of movies. I play a lot of charactery parts.</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> I know, I'm just kidding. But if you're gonna expose yourself in that way, you want to be pretty - everybody does.</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> I want to be in shape.</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> But there's some point of vanity. To me, the most offensive scene in any movie, nudity-wise, was Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct. It was like, I can't believe I have to look at this creepy old guy. I mean, that was a broke-down moment.</p> <p><b>Perez:</b> I think one of the best examples of nudity I've seen women do in movies is Blue Velvet, when home-chick came out on the lawn and she's naked. That was where I thought nudity was so appropriate, because this man tormented her and drove her to the point of insanity, so when she walked out on the lawn, you weren't saying to yourself, 'Oh, my God, Isabella Rossellini's naked,' you were saying, 'Oh, my God, she's finally flipped out.' You're so concentrated on her character.</p> <p><b>Udovitch:</b> Another thing about Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet is that she looked great when she came out naked, even completely tormented, but what she also looked like was like an un-worked-out body, and at that time, in 1986, you never saw that. In the 80s, after Madonna got worked out, all the standards changed. Because if you see 60s beach movies, those girls are pretty, but they have thighs, their stomachs aren't flat and you never see that any more.</p> <p><b>Bernhard:</b> Or if you see any of Russ Meyer's films.</p> <p><b>Parker:</b> It's funny because I always think how beautiful Isabella Rossellini is, and another person I always think of who is that beautiful is her mother.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to nudity, actresses are just like you and me - self-conscious, vain, insecure, eager to please and sometimes miserable. Except that when they take their clothes off, they have to do it in front of the people they work with, knowing that they have little if any control over how the images of their naked bodies - which will then be projected on to 30ft screens in front of millions of complete strangers - will ultimately be presented in the context of the finished project. And that their families will probably see them. And their friends. And that owing to the miracle of video rental, the internet and enormous media interest, these images will be preserved, if not for ever, at least for long enough that whatever the actresses' original thoughts about getting naked were, they'll probably have second, third and fourth thoughts about it. On the other hand, being a hot body can be extremely lucrative, and even career-making. It is increasingly a job requisite with, for example, actresses in their late teens and early twenties, like those in American Beauty, appearing topless as a matter of course, a circumstance that would have caused at least a mild stir 20 years ago. Nevertheless, other than a pro-forma disclaimer that the script called for it or a rare, and usually roundly mocked, claim of pride in nudity (think Demi Moore) or exploitation (think about the raised-eyebrow doubts that greeted Sharon Stone's contention that she was tricked into showing more than she knew in Basic Instinct), the women themselves rarely get a chance to say how they feel about this state of affairs. No one wants to look like a braggart or a whiner and, anyway, it's embarrassing to talk about. Rosie Perez, whose first film role - in Do the Right Thing - had such a memorable nude scene that a decade later she's still living it down (or up), convened a round table of some of her friends and colleagues, inviting a reporter to participate, to talk about the pressures, rewards and plain facts about getting naked in public. Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump, Fearless): I initially wanted to do this round table because of my stepdaughter, because she told me that there was a website where I was nude. And it just brought up a lot of questions, because now that I'm older and married and I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter, and she sees me naked on a website, I'm like: how am I going to respond to her? Am I going to say, 'Oh that's a horrible thing?' I really had to think, 'Wait a minute, do I really feel good about what I did? Do I feel embarrassed in front of her because I did those things?' And then I started reaching even further, and I remember there was a point in my career where I actually pulled back, because everybody wanted me to do these movies where I'm taking off my clothes and sassafrassing around, and then I found myself covering up, and I was like, 'Well, that's not me, either.' It's just that the whole entertainment industry forces you to deal with the issue of sexuality, and of your own sexuality. I see explicit covers on magazines, and they're getting even more explicit, and it's like, 'Are women being empowered, or is this just what sells magazines?' Are they feeling pressured, or have they really come into themselves and are saying, 'I am woman, hear me roar?' Mim Udovitch: Maybe we should start by going around the room and talking about your first, or your most memorable, experiences while doing nude scenes. Perez: My first experience, of course, was Do the Right Thing. And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think - that's what was really bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I don't want to do this. I felt like Irene Cara in Fame. It was like, 'Wait a minute, I feel so wimpy, this is not who I am.' So that was my first experience, and it was horrible. But then I went and took my clothes off again for White Men Can't Jump! But that was because it was totally my decision, I felt totally comfortable, the director was so cool and Woody Harrelson was like, 'Well, whatever you want is cool with me.' So there I felt empowered by it. But with Do the Right Thing it was like, 'Now I'm the object, here's the shot.' And the reason why I cried was not so much because I felt violated as because I was angry at myself, because I wanted to say: 'Say something! Get up!' So that's how I felt violated. I felt like I violated myself. Sarah Jessica Parker(Sex and the City, State and Main): Well, I've never done nudity. And I don't do nudity, and for no particular moral reason. It's not a judgment, and I'm very admiring of those people who feel comfortable enough to do it. The irony is that I come from a very politically progressive family. But I've just never felt comfortable, and I've always felt that I could convince whoever had an idea that nudity might be good in a scene that it wasn't. I was thinking of all these stories - not that a lot of people try to get me to take my clothes off - but in a work environment, when it's been discussed, there are some stories that are really awful, and in retrospect I felt that it was good old-fashioned Hollywood sexual harassment, where I didn't realise that was what was happening. Generally speaking, you're the only woman around, there's just men everywhere you look. I remember one experience in particular. They thought that I was going to do a nude scene the next day and they started joking about it the night before, saying, 'Oh, tomorrow Sarah Jessica's getting nude,' and it was very late at night, and everybody was laughing, and I said, 'No, I'm not,' and they said, 'Yes, you are.' And then there were phone calls made to my agent, and mean things were said. You know: 'We shouldn't have hired her. We should have hired so and so.' And I kept thinking, 'Oh, please God, fire me.' I mean the movie was bad anyway. It was a really awful situation. So I didn't do it, but the fellow playing opposite me did - he was totally nude in the scene, and it was just as awful as it gets. I thought, 'Well, that's his only means of making me feel uncomfortable now, for him to be nude because he knows that for me this is awkward.' Udovitch: So your contracts specify no nude scenes? Parker: Yes. And now that I'm married, not that there's any kind of dictatorship in the house, but he doesn't even really like to see a photograph that is meant to be titillating or whatever, it makes him feel uncomfortable. And I think I'm much more conscious of that, too, now - like what I do at work, too, even a scene with a bra and skirt. Sandra Bernhard (The King of Comedy, I'm Still Here\u0085 Damn It): For me, any time I've used nudity in my work, I've always felt strangely detached from it, and it's always been on a lot of different levels that it's worked for me, and had sort of a multipurpose emotional and cultural reference. So I've never felt in any way, shape or form exploited or used, because it's always been pretty much my decision. Even in King of Comedy, where I stripped down for Jerry Lewis, it's such a perfect metaphor for any woman's darkest fantasy. It's always been, I don't know, kind of a kick for me - having grown up being really skinny and, like, not particularly confident, for me it has always felt really liberating. Perez: That's how I felt for White Men Can't Jump. Bernhard: But you're a little bit more bodacious than I am, so I'm sure your whole life you've kind of been looked at in a much more sexual way, and ogled. Also, when you do comedy, you're usually alone onstage, so you're calling the shots. And if you're not self-deprecating, you just don't get into that whole sort of I'm-being-completely-exploited-by-the-patriarchy thing. And in terms of my own daughter, we kind of always wander around naked together, so it's pretty open and relaxed. I think it's something I missed growing up. That's not my mother's thing, she's not sexual, so for me it was kind of like a new experience to be sexual and express it through my work. Because in my own life I'm sometimes completely detached from it as well. Sarita Choudhury (Mississippi Masala, Kama Sutra): My first time nude was with a woman director, so I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't. I got my period just before. Debi Mazar (GoodFellas, The Insider): Me, too! Choudhury: Really? And so I didn't want to come down from the room - it was horrific. Usually, though, I feel really comfortable during the scene, and then I hate it when the movie is going to come out. My family is conservative, and that is hard. I don't know why it's so liberating when I'm doing it and then\u0085 I guess it just shows, and it's weird, that an experience can be normal, but when you think about it in the context of family and tradition, then it's not. Perez: It's funny. With family, I don't know what to say any more. My father calls and he says: 'Hello, baby! Do I see this one?' 'No.' 'OK, bye!' Amber Valletta (What Lies Beneath, Drop Back Ten): Well, none of the films I've done were nude. But one of the first modelling jobs I got that was big, that was a break, I got for French Elle - and in France nudity is not a big deal. I went on the job because one of the two models got sick, and the other one was Claudia Schiffer. Obviously I was kind of the nobody, so she got all the work - it was a week in the Seychelles, and they were like, 'Well, we'll shoot a couple of covers on you when we get a chance.' I was 17, maybe 18, and they asked me to take off my top for one of these pictures. And the picture is of me like this [crosses arms over breasts and freezes] and I look so uncomfortable. I had never taken off my clothes for a photographer before, and he was particularly mean, he was very macho, and it didn't make it any easier. And I kind of regret ever doing that for them, even though the photo never ran, because it was not something I felt good about. I think for one, I was too young, I wasn't even that sexual. Nor did it make any sense for the photo. Since then I have done a few nude pictures and I'm very, very careful about it - like I know the number of nude pictures that are out. But then there are runway photos that are on the internet. This one kid came up to me and said, 'Can you sign this?' And I looked, and it was a totally sheer top - you could see my breasts like it was broad daylight. And you just never think, because it's for a fashion show, that those pictures might get cut for\u0085 Mazar: Celebrity Skin! Perez: That was the website! Valletta: Actually, I've seen it twice now, so now I am even careful on runways, but sometimes you just say, 'I don't care, I feel good.' But the first one was definitely uncomfortable. Udovitch: The difference maybe is you're in a position now where you can say no, and before, you really\u0085 Valletta: I couldn't. I was trying to do a job, and I was with a model who was already made, and she was going to do the picture if I wasn't, probably, and maybe not naked, but it would have been one more for her and one less for me. And when you're young and naive\u0085 it's not that you're not given a choice, but you maybe don't know what your choices are. Udovitch: Everyone has said that power is an issue. Sandra has said she's the most comfortable, and she's the one who has the most power over what she does. And it's funny what Sarah Jessica said, about the male actor in the love scene, that male nudity expresses power the other way, you know, it imposes power. Mazar: For me, I basically had hippie parents, and I've always been a very sexual person and OK with people seeing my body - so my first experience being naked, I gave full nudity. I read it, I discussed it with the director, we discussed how we were going to shoot it - it was going to be very Bu\u00f1uel-like, starting with the tip of my heel - and we had it all mapped out, and I felt, Wow, this is going to be really cool. It was my first big studio lead. It was called Money for Nothing. It had John Cusack, Benicio Del Toro, all these great actors. And then, at the end of the day, it was completely gratuitous, like they just showed me sitting on him, frontal. It wasn't artistic, it wasn't beautiful, it wasn't even a good angle for me. And I just felt like, 'Damn, there's really nothing you can do about it, because you never know how they're going to cut it up.' Now, with love scenes, often if I read a script and I don't trust a director, I have a clause - no nudity. Perez: That's something that's really bizarre, when you get to that point in the Hollywood system where you have to negotiate certain body parts. Choudhury: Oh, completely! It's absurd! Perez: It's like, No below nipple, no crotch shot, only side, no frontal, or in the frontal, only stomach\u0085 Mazar: And no crack. Mm-hmm. Perez: Right, no crack. They literally have these terms, and you sit there thinking, What the hell is going on? It drives me crazy to the point where I want to say, 'No, you can't show nothing,' not because I don't believe in it, but because it's so absurd. Parker: It's worth noting that we feel we need protection with this, whereas everything else that we're told as women of a certain generation is, 'We are as good, we're equal, we can have the whole thing,' and we still feel we need somebody, a manager or an agent or a big, burly somebody, to say no. Udovitch: But then some women who have chosen to take their clothes off - and examples that spring to mind are Demi Moore, Madonna, Elizabeth Berkley, obviously a big range of performers doing very different kinds of work - but they were all clobbered, in a way that it's hard to believe anybody deserves for anything they do in entertainment. Mazar: Did it hurt them? No. Parker: I think it hurt Elizabeth Berkley. Choudhury: I think it hurt Demi Moore. I think it hurt her big time. Udovitch: I think it hurt Madonna in the short term, also. Parker: Perhaps it's not fair to prognosticate about Elizabeth Berkley, but it's an easy example, in a way. I looked at Showgirls, and although I don't know what she was thinking, what it felt like in the audience, she wanted to be in a big movie, and it wasn't good, the script wasn't good. But look how different Gina Gershon was - she seemed very self-aware and ironic. Udovitch: I think Elizabeth Berkley was different in that she was very young, and she just did what the director told her and, as it happened, it didn't work. Perez [to Bernhard]: What's the matter? Do you not agree, lady? Bernhard: Nothing's the matter. I have nothing to say about Showgirls. I just think it's a campy, funny film, and I think anybody in that role would have probably been in the same position. It was an asinine role, the film was completely absurd and, I mean, it didn't even capture Vegas. But it was brilliant, it was hysterical, it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen! There's no way you can take that movie seriously. Mazar: I went in to audition on that movie. I knew it wasn't good when I read it, and I thought, 'Man, I'll go in, and I'll work it, I'll use my sexuality because I can.' Bernhard: Did you go in for Gina's role? Mazar: Yeah. And when I walk into an audition, I do use my sexuality to get a part, to put it out there, to convince them. Bernhard: If you're going in and using your sexuality to get a part, how can you ever get offended if they want you to be nude? Mazar: I don't. But I decide when I get exploited now. Bernhard: That's fair. Mazar: I figure I've done enough movies now that I know angles, I know lighting, I know\u0085 Bernhard: It's all about looking beautiful for you, I think. Mazar: No! I look ugly in a lot of movies. I play a lot of charactery parts. Bernhard: I know, I'm just kidding. But if you're gonna expose yourself in that way, you want to be pretty - everybody does. Perez: I want to be in shape. Bernhard: But there's some point of vanity. To me, the most offensive scene in any movie, nudity-wise, was Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct. It was like, I can't believe I have to look at this creepy old guy. I mean, that was a broke-down moment. Perez: I think one of the best examples of nudity I've seen women do in movies is Blue Velvet, when home-chick came out on the lawn and she's naked. That was where I thought nudity was so appropriate, because this man tormented her and drove her to the point of insanity, so when she walked out on the lawn, you weren't saying to yourself, 'Oh, my God, Isabella Rossellini's naked,' you were saying, 'Oh, my God, she's finally flipped out.' You're so concentrated on her character. Udovitch: Another thing about Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet is that she looked great when she came out naked, even completely tormented, but what she also looked like was like an un-worked-out body, and at that time, in 1986, you never saw that. In the 80s, after Madonna got worked out, all the standards changed. Because if you see 60s beach movies, those girls are pretty, but they have thighs, their stomachs aren't flat and you never see that any more. Bernhard: Or if you see any of Russ Meyer's films. Parker: It's funny because I always think how beautiful Isabella Rossellini is, and another person I always think of who is that beautiful is her mother. And her mother was like, a Woman. It's like, 'Oh, maybe some day I'll be a woman.' She's just like flesh, and sexy! Bernhard: You better start eating, honey. You got a long way to go. Udovitch: Did anyone see Kate Winslet in Holy Smoke? She has a normal body, and she's beautiful. Parker: I love her. Perez: But talking about Madonna, the sculptured body, nudity and sexuality, I feel so much pressure to stay small. And as you get older, it gets a little bit harder, and I love to eat. And when you go to Los Angeles, when you go on interviews and auditions, the first thing that they look at is your chest and your hips - they want to see how good your body is. Mazar: I got prosthetic breasts, I got three sets. I got the chicken cutlets for the normal size - these are all for mastectomy patients - and then I got the next size, and then I got the nursing size, and I use them to create different shapes of body depending on the character, because sometimes I'll just figure out a way not to take my top off if I get the movie. But to get it, sometimes I walk in with these huge prosthetic breasts and big sweaters, because you know, you get a whole other body language. Choudhury: I liked Rosie's ice-cube scene in Do the Right Thing. Bernhard: But she was saying just before you got here that it made her cry when she was doing it. Choudhury: But I liked your body, because I have breasts, so I was like, Oh, yeah. I was just comforted because there weren't many girls with that build. Perez: No, there weren't. First of all, back then there weren't many Puerto Rican girls in a lead role. Udovitch: And now there are so many. Perez: Yeah, right - there's two more! Since 1989! Choudhury: And the thing is, everybody says about Kate Winslet how they love her body, but the truth is, out in the world, no one really does. I mean, everyone does, but no one wants to hire that body. It's like everyone says they love my body, but then I'm supposed to lose weight.

As a diplomatic Soho bar owner once said when a customer tried to apologise for his drunken behaviour the night before, 'Post-mortems are for the dead.'

As if a forlorn shadow of doom fall on all the spades in the country.' </p> <p>Moses goes on to say he wants to write a book like that which had recently been penned by Colin Wilson, one that might tug him out of poverty and transform him from outsider to insider, one that might bring both the 'kiff-kiff laughter' and the 'shadow of doom' of his friends to public attention.</p> <p>The Lonely Londoners should have been the novel to do that. For in its vimmy, almost Elizabethan idiorhythms, its unforgettable cast of gadabouts and charming rogues, its use of a sketchy and episodic structure that mirrors the elusive zig-zaggery of its characters, and its tone which is blue both in its bawdy humour and its barely submerged pensivity, Selvon wrote what can today be acknowledged as one of the very finest postwar works of fiction. </p> <p>Yet he died in 1994 having written almost nothing for two decades, increasingly dependent upon drink, and rightly bitter at the lack of financial recognition for his work. He has been, nonetheless, an inspiration to many of the authors included in James Procter's <strong> Writing black Britain 1948-1998</strong>. This anthology collects together creative and critical works by the likes of Andrew Salkey, Wole Soyinka, C.L.R. James, Salman Rushdie, Meera Syal and Paul Gilroy, to produce what is, in effect, a foundation text for those interested in understanding contemporary England. I stress England as the notion of 'black Britain' is a fiction which both the tiny ethnic populations in Scotland and Wales and the metrocentric focus of most of the pieces in this anthology serve to confirm. </p> <p>Even within England, the black population has always been very small. Migrant writers of the Fifties such as Naipaul wrote, whether they liked it or not, primarily for white audiences. It was not unknown for poets touting for work to write to radio producers and announce 'I am a black man'. In those days, they were prized by commissioning editors for their ability to shed light on the 'race problem' or the 'colour issue'.</p> <p>The social and literary climate soured sharply after the Notting Hill Riots of 1958. George Lamming likened the new situation to life during the Blitz. The popularity of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart heralded a vogue for African fiction and helped to marginalise Anglo-Caribbean writers. Many of them began to spend more time in America. </p> <p>By the early Seventies, a combination of economic downturn, the trickle-down popularity of Black Power rhetoric and the rise of militant Rastafarianism led to black English literature becoming fiercely protest-orientated. The street, that hallowed zone of gangsta rap today, was seen as the source of authentic creativity.</p> <p>This led to the perception of black writing as a form of emergency literature, one that was of socio-political rather than aesthetic importance. The Eighties also saw the emergence of black women writers such as Grace Nichols and, as seen in the novels of Caryl Phillips and David Dabydeen, a growing interest in pre-Windrush black English history. These fictions were perceived by some as too rarified, and by the Nineties a new form of pulp literature, inspired in equal parts by American blaxploitation and by Richard Allen's skinhead novels of the Seventies, found increasing success. </p> <p>While Procter traces this trajectory and with some skill, he's less willing to pose difficult questions about quality. Why, he might have asked, has black English literature so rarely been interesting at any level other than that of content? It has failed to make stylistic or formal innovations on a par with trip-hop's knee-capped beats, the dread skitter of drum'n'bass, or garage's bump'n' flex euphorics. His selection also veers towards the mirthless and could have done with the impish satires of Tariq Ali or Ved Mehta's Delinquent Chacha. </p> <p>Where Procter's anthology is mainly concerned with the past, Courttia Newland and Kadija Sesay, editors of <strong> IC3</strong>, are more interested in the here and now. Their book weighs in at 450 pages and includes almost a hundred African-Caribbean writers from first to third generation. For all its compendiousness, however, this is a slapdash and only sporadically diverting anthology. Its very title (IC3 is the police identity code for Black), which the editors claim 'defines Black British people as a whole', may strike readers as bleakly reductive. </p> <p>More importantly, the volume is far too long and could easily have done without its rash of earth-mother poeticisings, Floella Benjamin reprinting letters which tell her what an inspirational force she has been for cultural diversity, or its bizarre essays full of bullet-pointed recommendations about the importance of management training.</p> <p>Some of the pieces in IC3 might usefully have been edited to give them a semblance of shape and structure. Slipshod proof-reading leads to some amusing typos - 'enigmatic Jude Law, artistic director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse', Linda Bellos berates European historians and broadcasters for their skimpy knowledge of key black figures such as as the West Indian all-rounder and member of the House of Lords 'Learly Constantine'. </p> <p>The best pieces are those which shirk superficially contemporary buzziness: 'Sunday Morning Blues' by Ferdinance Dennis is a tenderly melancholic remembrance of unrequited love; Colin Babb relates the importance of cricket to him as he was growing up in Seventies Croydon, Kevin Le Gendre paeans the freeform saxophony of the long-forgotten Joe Harriott. </p> <p>Most of these contributions are non-fictional. They also tend to have a strong historical bent and often focus on the travails of senior folk. This suggests that the publishing industry's desire to unearth writers from the 'margins', rude-talkin' yout' who can furnish provocative dispatches from behind the frontline of transgressive ethnic subculture, is misguided. </p> <p>Few of the writers in IC3 say anything new. Perhaps what we need is something old. The best black English writers - novelists such as Dennis, Biyi Bandele and Zadie Smith - are those who are attuned to slowness and crabbiness, those who braid gaiety and compassion to uncover the sedimented aspirations of everyday people. Those who do, in other words, exactly what Sam Selvon was doing half a century ago.</p>",

This anthology collects together creative and critical works by the likes of Andrew Salkey, Wole Soyinka, C.L.R. James, Salman Rushdie, Meera Syal and Paul Gilroy, to produce what is, in effect, a foundation text for those interested in understanding contemporary England. I stress England as the notion of 'black Britain' is a fiction which both the tiny ethnic populations in Scotland and Wales and the metrocentric focus of most of the pieces in this anthology serve to confirm. Even within England, the black population has always been very small. Migrant writers of the Fifties such as Naipaul wrote, whether they liked it or not, primarily for white audiences. It was not unknown for poets touting for work to write to radio producers and announce 'I am a black man'. In those days, they were prized by commissioning editors for their ability to shed light on the 'race problem' or the 'colour issue'. The social and literary climate soured sharply after the Notting Hill Riots of 1958. George Lamming likened the new situation to life during the Blitz. The popularity of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart heralded a vogue for African fiction and helped to marginalise Anglo-Caribbean writers. Many of them began to spend more time in America. By the early Seventies, a combination of economic downturn, the trickle-down popularity of Black Power rhetoric and the rise of militant Rastafarianism led to black English literature becoming fiercely protest-orientated. The street, that hallowed zone of gangsta rap today, was seen as the source of authentic creativity. This led to the perception of black writing as a form of emergency literature, one that was of socio-political rather than aesthetic importance. The Eighties also saw the emergence of black women writers such as Grace Nichols and, as seen in the novels of Caryl Phillips and David Dabydeen, a growing interest in pre-Windrush black English history. These fictions were perceived by some as too rarified, and by the Nineties a new form of pulp literature, inspired in equal parts by American blaxploitation and by Richard Allen's skinhead novels of the Seventies, found increasing success. While Procter traces this trajectory and with some skill, he's less willing to pose difficult questions about quality. Why, he might have asked, has black English literature so rarely been interesting at any level other than that of content? It has failed to make stylistic or formal innovations on a par with trip-hop's knee-capped beats, the dread skitter of drum'n'bass, or garage's bump'n' flex euphorics. His selection also veers towards the mirthless and could have done with the impish satires of Tariq Ali or Ved Mehta's Delinquent Chacha. Where Procter's anthology is mainly concerned with the past, Courttia Newland and Kadija Sesay, editors of IC3, are more interested in the here and now. Their book weighs in at 450 pages and includes almost a hundred African-Caribbean writers from first to third generation. For all its compendiousness, however, this is a slapdash and only sporadically diverting anthology. Its very title (IC3 is the police identity code for Black), which the editors claim 'defines Black British people as a whole', may strike readers as bleakly reductive. More importantly, the volume is far too long and could easily have done without its rash of earth-mother poeticisings, Floella Benjamin reprinting letters which tell her what an inspirational force she has been for cultural diversity, or its bizarre essays full of bullet-pointed recommendations about the importance of management training. Some of the pieces in IC3 might usefully have been edited to give them a semblance of shape and structure. Slipshod proof-reading leads to some amusing typos - 'enigmatic Jude Law, artistic director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse', Linda Bellos berates European historians and broadcasters for their skimpy knowledge of key black figures such as as the West Indian all-rounder and member of the House of Lords 'Learly Constantine'. The best pieces are those which shirk superficially contemporary buzziness: 'Sunday Morning Blues' by Ferdinance Dennis is a tenderly melancholic remembrance of unrequited love; Colin Babb relates the importance of cricket to him as he was growing up in Seventies Croydon, Kevin Le Gendre paeans the freeform saxophony of the long-forgotten Joe Harriott. Most of these contributions are non-fictional. They also tend to have a strong historical bent and often focus on the travails of senior folk. This suggests that the publishing industry's desire to unearth writers from the 'margins', rude-talkin' yout' who can furnish provocative dispatches from behind the frontline of transgressive ethnic subculture, is misguided. Few of the writers in IC3 say anything new. Perhaps what we need is something old. The best black English writers - novelists such as Dennis, Biyi Bandele and Zadie Smith - are those who are attuned to slowness and crabbiness, those who braid gaiety and compassion to uncover the sedimented aspirations of everyday people. Those who do, in other words, exactly what Sam Selvon was doing half a century ago.",

      "body": "<p>Is he the new Chandler, or merely the new Hemingway? Or nothing more exciting than 'the coolest writer in America? All these compliments and more have been flowing over the past two years towards 43-year-old George P. Pelecanos, son of a Greek caf\u00e9 owner in Washington, D.C., who 10 years ago began writing about the parts of his city we never hear about - the blacks and Greeks and Mexicans, the janitors and short-order cooks, the 80 per cent of Washington's population who try to survive in the long hot miserable shadows cast by their very big, rich, white Capitol.</p> <p>Eight books later, after a decade of silence broken only by a few cult reviews and word of mouth, he has the feel of something about to go global, to fill and empty the world's shelves as swiftly as James Ellroy and James Lee Burke.</p> <p>Critical America still sneers, a little, for the snobbery towards 'crime' writers is as poisonous still as in Chandler's day, but in Europe he's becoming huge, and Hollywood is now filming his recent King Suckerman.</p> <p>Pelecanos, a genuinely modest, quiet man, tries to shrug off the comparisons. 'I don't know. I just like to write. I love it.' But he knows the references, knows why the comparisons are made. 'Chandler, much as I admire him, had a very romantic notion of his guy [Marlowe]; he was always able to look down on the rest of us morally. I try not to do that.' Instead, his anti-heroes - in three books this is his alter ego Nick Stefanos, a binge alcoholic and philanderer - struggle with the moral ambiguities of living real lives and trying, when it counts, to do the right thing.</p> <p>They take drugs, play basketball, cheat on women, argue over music - the Pelecanos oeuvre is gloriously rich in musical soundtracking for the eras he covers, from the Forties onwards (which has led to wholly crass comparisons with Nick Hornby); in Suckerman, much of it set in a record shop, the plot practically turns on whether Hendrix should be stacked in the 'rock' or 'soul' bins.</p> <p>And, while his too-flawed characters reach within to find whether they will, in the end, stand for good or evil, and move inexorably, fuelled by drink or drugs or fear, towards bloody shoot-outs where you genuinely don't know who will be left standing, they do so against a backdrop of real Washington, Washington behind open doors, that Pelecanos draws lovingly, magnificently.</p> <p>He can make the ordering of a meatloaf enthral for three pages; a shot of Old Grand Dad going into a heavy bevelled shot glass fills half a chapter. Hemingway had Nick Adams land fish in less time. He can write seemingly throwaway lines - 'Though the day was already hot, I drank the coffee, because you have to drink coffee when you're sitting at the counter at Sherill's' - which speak volumes in a handful of words about the city and its heat and mores and its characters.</p> <p>He nods, reluctantly, at the Hemingway reference. 'He and [Dashiell] Hammett are very closely related; their style is reportorial. Hemingway, particularly, agonised over every sentence. But if I'm wary of critical references it might be because I'm wary of American critics. Hemingway was also, you have to remember, hugely popular, read by everyone. And that's what I want; I want to be able to be read by the guy cooking in the kitchen, with my paperback in his back pocket. I don't write for the critics.'</p> <p>He began writing, still writes, he says, for himself, and as a means to an end. For he was poor. He was working caf\u00e9s, bars and electrical stores. And taking drugs, and drinking, and whoring. 'It's no secret that Stefanos is me up to a certain point. What happened is that I started writing and started building a family and those things got to be more important to me than the other things that I was doing that were making me fall down quite a bit.'</p> <p>Literally? He laughs. 'Yes. I... I had my moments. There's a definite romance to drinking, of course. I've woken up in an alley covered in roach bites, passed out senseless for hours. That was a low point, certainly.' A turning point? 'No, that would be too simple, life's not that neat. And I like to drink, and I want to be able to drink for the rest of my life, but in order to do that you've got to have some control, right? I just grew up a little bit. Same with drugs. I think I've just been lucky like that. I found something in my life - my wife, my family (he has three adopted children) that was much more important.</p> <p>'But I've no regrets about that part of my life. I just see it as a progression - fine, I've done that, let's move on. In the books I don't moralise about it, pretending drugs are simply bad, drink is bad; they're also a lot of fun. But in the morning you've got to pay the check, man, you've got to pay the bill.'</p> <p>If there was a turning point, he says, one came in his teenage years, when he accidentally shot a friend. 'We were fucking around with a gun and we shouldn't have been, and I squeezed off a shot and hit my friend in the face. It's with me every day.' Which is why comparisons with Tarantino are also wrong, for he steadfastly refuses to glamorise gunplay in his books; it's there, but it's nasty. You learn just what bullets do, as he learnt.</p> <p>'I hate our gun culture, loathe it. Millions of handguns floating around, and our politicians are all too corrupt and cowardly to do anything. You stop at a red light at night, and someone walks in front of you and casually swings the coat open, just to let you know they're carrying. It's poisonous, awful. So I write about it.</p> <p>'Also, you hear about race in Washington, but to be honest the whole thing's more about class than it is about race, and that's what I try to write about. Anyone who's so-called middle-class here is just one step above poverty. They've got the car, and the house, but it's all on credit; they're one pay cheque away from the poor and the junkies and the dispossessed, and that's why they hate them, that's what breeds the fear.</p> <p>'Washington, you see...' and this frighteningly well-controlled man starts getting angry, seriously angry... 'books and films, they've always focused on the federal stuff, mad generals with their fingers on the button. So I write about the rest. I'm only writing about what I know. I grew up there as the son of a guy who ran a coffee shop, and all my friends were the same. And what did we grow up in? This great, dichotomy of Washington. This federal city existing in the middle of this working-class city, and the two of them never touch.</p> <p>'You've got this famous Capitol dome looming over streets where you see nothing but despair and poverty and drugs and crime. It's right there, man, and the government is right there, it's right in front of them, and they don't do a god damn thing about it. Not a god damn thing.</p> <p>'Yes, it makes me angry.' And scared? Not really, he says; he's seen enough, thinks he knows enough. 'I've been through it. You learn. You'd go to score a deal in a caf\u00e9 and suddenly there are guns on the table, and it's, oh-oh, and if you get out of it you know not to deal with these people again, not to go there. So you learn.</p> <p>'And I wouldn't like to leave. Sure, I'd love to live here, in London, I think it's great. And there's a good drinking culture. But I've built a trap for myself by writing about what I know; I fear I would dry up if I left. I'm still in touch with the people there, in the caf\u00e9s and bars. And they're good people, they're pleased for me.'</p> <p>Did writing scare him, then or now? 'It's not as scary as when I started. because now I know there's a good chance it's going to turn out all right once I get into the characters. I start bringing these minor characters into the book and I like them, and they become major characters, and something happens. So that's OK.</p> <p>'No, what scares me... well, this stuff probably,' meaning incipient fame. 'The feeling it's all getting bigger, about to get bigger. That. That is scary.' </p> <p>\u0095 The paperback of George P. Pelecanos's latest novel The Big Blowdown will be published on 10 August</p>",

      "body": "<p>Aah. Thosse summer holidays. Long rainy days in Britain. Long car journeys through France. Long afternoons when you want to lie in the sun and THEY are fed up with the sea and the sand. The solution for the inevitable boredom that sets in at some point during the vacation is a stack of books. Enticing. Riveting. Funny. Scary. Thought-provoking. This year's crop won't let you down or disappoint them. </p> <p>My 10-year-old daughter, Harriet, gave a complete thumbs-up to Margaret Peterson Haddix's <strong> Running Out of Time</strong> (The Bodley Head \u00a310.99, pp180) - a terrific first novel that Harriet described as 'incredibly exciting'. It's the story of Jessie, who's 13. It is set in 1840 in America and an epidemic of diphtheria has broken out in the small village of Clifton. But all is not what it seems.</p> <p>Jessie's mother sends her to get help - from the modern world. For Clifton is an experiment, a theme village where the adults have chosen to live as pioneers, watched by tourists through hidden cameras. The children are ignorant of the truth and Jessie's parents have only just become aware of the sinister intentions of the man who set it up. Jessie has to escape into a world she knows nothing of and risk her life before finally saving the day. Beautifully done. Ignore the rather silly, lurid cover - it's not worthy of the inside. (10-13) </p> <p>Harriet also thought Anne Fine's <strong> Bad Dreams</strong> (illustrated by Susan Winter, Doubleday \u00a310.99, pp154) was a good read. Mel loves reading and can't understand why new girl Imogen seems to be afraid of books. Is it something to do with the necklace she wears which seems to have strange powers? Mel, against her will, finds herself compelled to discover the truth. (8-11) </p> <p>Thomas Bloor's <strong> The Memory Prisoner</strong> (Hodder \u00a33.99, pp151) is a subversive, funny and imaginative book with an unlikely heroine. Maddie 'a towering mountain of a girl' has not left the house since the day her grandad died when she was two - 13 years ago. She spends her days eating and uses her little brother, Keith, as her eyes and ears in the outside world. Her mother is equally eccentric with a peculiar fear of cupboards. When Keith is selected to study at the sinister Tower Library, the secret of what really happened to Grandad starts to unravel, but Maddie has to leave her self-imposed prison to save her brother and solve the mystery. (11-13) </p> <p>Gillian Cross (author of The Demon Headmaster) has come up with a gritty and taut thriller in <strong> Tightrope</strong> (Puffin \u00a34.99, pp198). Ashley cares for her sick mother and works hard at school. But by night she is a graffiti artist. Things get complicated when she becomes embroiled in a gang run by local tough guy Eddie Beale, who has a peculiar taste for people who can do tricks. He's fascinated by Ashley's gymnastic stunts. </p> <p>When she realises that someone is stalking her she has to decide whether to turn to Eddie for help. Or will that put her in more danger? This is very well-written with excellent characterisation and a great plot. It's told mainly from Ashley's point of view plus extracts from other characters' thoughts as well. A terrific 'bridge' book for people moving towards adult fiction. (12-15) </p> <p>Older readers should also not miss Lynne Markham's <strong> The Closing March</strong> (Mammoth \u00a34.99, pp169) - a moving, unsentimental story set in the last days of the Nottinghamshire coalfield. Mick has a rare gift for art and somehow his dying grandfather's memories of his life as a miner become part of Mick's sketches, which chart a life imprisoned and upheld by the culture of the mine. Moving and deftly done. (12-15) </p> <p>At the younger end of the read-alone range, there are also some treasures. My younger daughter, Abigail, who's eight, loved Stephen Moore's <strong> The Brugan</strong> (Hodder \u00a33.99, pp230). Sarah Lemming ('as thin as string with granny knots for knees') has a lot to put up with. Her father's dead and she detests her mother's (perfectly nice) boyfriend, Fat Finlay. A new baby is on the way and the family move to a cottage deep in the countryside.</p> <p>To top everything, although the adults naturally won't believe it, very strange things start to happen. The strangest of all is the Brugan ('Ugly. Smelly. And a vile shade of green.') who has powers that can wreak havoc. Bringing together real scary things (such as a new father and a new baby) and unreal scary things (supernatural beings) is no mean feat. Terrific book. (8-10) </p> <p>Abigail also loved <strong>Astrid, the au pair from Outer Space</strong> by Emily Smith (illustrated by Tim Archbold.Young Corgi \u00a33.50, pp108). Mum wants a nice 'down-to-Earth' girl to look after Harry and Fred - and that's what she gets when Astrid turns up from her planet 500 light years away. 'Oh!' she cries, looking at a vase of flowers. 'Cut plant parts!' Life with Astrid is huge fun, if more than a little eccentric. (8-10) </p> <p>Ann Pilling's <strong> Amber's Secret </strong> (Collins \u00a39.99, pp190) is a charming book set in 1953. Sally's mother is seriously ill in hospital, her father is abroad and her brother's doing his National Service. Sally is staying with a grumpy neighbour.

      "bodyText": "Aah. Thosse summer holidays. Long rainy days in Britain. Long car journeys through France. Long afternoons when you want to lie in the sun and THEY are fed up with the sea and the sand. The solution for the inevitable boredom that sets in at some point during the vacation is a stack of books. Enticing. Riveting. Funny. Scary. Thought-provoking. This year's crop won't let you down or disappoint them. My 10-year-old daughter, Harriet, gave a complete thumbs-up to Margaret Peterson Haddix's Running Out of Time (The Bodley Head \u00a310.99, pp180) - a terrific first novel that Harriet described as 'incredibly exciting'. It's the story of Jessie, who's 13. It is set in 1840 in America and an epidemic of diphtheria has broken out in the small village of Clifton. But all is not what it seems. Jessie's mother sends her to get help - from the modern world. For Clifton is an experiment, a theme village where the adults have chosen to live as pioneers, watched by tourists through hidden cameras. The children are ignorant of the truth and Jessie's parents have only just become aware of the sinister intentions of the man who set it up. Jessie has to escape into a world she knows nothing of and risk her life before finally saving the day. Beautifully done. Ignore the rather silly, lurid cover - it's not worthy of the inside. (10-13) Harriet also thought Anne Fine's Bad Dreams (illustrated by Susan Winter, Doubleday \u00a310.99, pp154) was a good read. Mel loves reading and can't understand why new girl Imogen seems to be afraid of books. Is it something to do with the necklace she wears which seems to have strange powers? Mel, against her will, finds herself compelled to discover the truth. (8-11) Thomas Bloor's The Memory Prisoner (Hodder \u00a33.99, pp151) is a subversive, funny and imaginative book with an unlikely heroine. Maddie 'a towering mountain of a girl' has not left the house since the day her grandad died when she was two - 13 years ago. She spends her days eating and uses her little brother, Keith, as her eyes and ears in the outside world. Her mother is equally eccentric with a peculiar fear of cupboards. When Keith is selected to study at the sinister Tower Library, the secret of what really happened to Grandad starts to unravel, but Maddie has to leave her self-imposed prison to save her brother and solve the mystery. (11-13) Gillian Cross (author of The Demon Headmaster) has come up with a gritty and taut thriller in Tightrope (Puffin \u00a34.99, pp198). Ashley cares for her sick mother and works hard at school. But by night she is a graffiti artist. Things get complicated when she becomes embroiled in a gang run by local tough guy Eddie Beale, who has a peculiar taste for people who can do tricks. He's fascinated by Ashley's gymnastic stunts. When she realises that someone is stalking her she has to decide whether to turn to Eddie for help. Or will that put her in more danger? This is very well-written with excellent characterisation and a great plot. It's told mainly from Ashley's point of view plus extracts from other characters' thoughts as well. A terrific 'bridge' book for people moving towards adult fiction. (12-15) Older readers should also not miss Lynne Markham's The Closing March (Mammoth \u00a34.99, pp169) - a moving, unsentimental story set in the last days of the Nottinghamshire coalfield. Mick has a rare gift for art and somehow his dying grandfather's memories of his life as a miner become part of Mick's sketches, which chart a life imprisoned and upheld by the culture of the mine. Moving and deftly done. (12-15) At the younger end of the read-alone range, there are also some treasures. My younger daughter, Abigail, who's eight, loved Stephen Moore's The Brugan (Hodder \u00a33.99, pp230). Sarah Lemming ('as thin as string with granny knots for knees') has a lot to put up with. Her father's dead and she detests her mother's (perfectly nice) boyfriend, Fat Finlay. A new baby is on the way and the family move to a cottage deep in the countryside. To top everything, although the adults naturally won't believe it, very strange things start to happen. The strangest of all is the Brugan ('Ugly. Smelly. And a vile shade of green.') who has powers that can wreak havoc. Bringing together real scary things (such as a new father and a new baby) and unreal scary things (supernatural beings) is no mean feat. Terrific book. (8-10) Abigail also loved Astrid, the au pair from Outer Space by Emily Smith (illustrated by Tim Archbold.Young Corgi \u00a33.50, pp108). Mum wants a nice 'down-to-Earth' girl to look after Harry and Fred - and that's what she gets when Astrid turns up from her planet 500 light years away. 'Oh!' she cries, looking at a vase of flowers. 'Cut plant parts!' Life with Astrid is huge fun, if more than a little eccentric. (8-10) Ann Pilling's Amber's Secret (Collins \u00a39.99, pp190) is a charming book set in 1953. Sally's mother is seriously ill in hospital, her father is abroad and her brother's doing his National Service. Sally is staying with a grumpy neighbour. A terrible thing happens when she returns home to feed her mouse. The family grandfather clock falls over and is badly broken. For Sally, getting the clock mended is somehow tied up with her mother getting well and the family getting back together. A very disparate band of people help her out. A book full of sweetness, but not at all sugary. (8-11) Finally, Martin Waddell's The Ghost and Bertie Boggin (illustrated by Tony Ross. Walker \u00a37.99, pp158) is cheeringly funny. Bertie, the smallest Boggin in a house full of Bogginses, is fed up with them. Thank goodness a ghost has moved into the coal shed and things start to liven up.

About $10 million has already been spent training hundreds of specially trained Food and Drug Administration agents and sending investigators to raid prescription sites. </p> <p>Of 350 providers and pharmacies hit, about 150 have come under criminal investigation.

Fuelling the emotion of this battle, the lobby fighting on Capitol Hill to oppose the Bill is led by Roy Lucas, famous in America for his victory in the epic Roe versus Wade case which established the legal right to abortion. </p> <p>Lucas says Clinton's 'witch-hunt' legislation is 'oppressive and needing to be watered down tremendously'. </p> <p>The government insists that the drugs - especially Xenica and Viagra - are abused by people who do not need them medically for slimming or sexual recreation. It says patients fall victim to 'cowboy' websites. </p> <p>Officials cite the proliferation of Viagra in clubland, and claims the drug is being sold to buyers and administered to patients who simply fill in online questionnaires. </p> <p>The senior policy chief at the administration, William Hubbard, testified to Congress during hearings last month that 'illegal dispensing of prescription drugs poses a serious threat to the health and safety of American citizens'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, besieged prescribers and online doctors have formed OPPA - the Online Prescription Providers' Association - whose director Anton Pusztai retorts: 'Where are the victims? We read and read about the victims of obesity, arthritis, impotence and allergies, but where are the victims of these drugs?' </p> <p>Pusztai says, as with Prohibition and abortion, the closing down of legitimate sites that provide consultations with doctors will only 'give the rogues and the cowboys the break they need'. </p> <p>The providers want a list of drugs that do not contain 'controlled substances' on the internet, with guarantees of proper medical consultation online or by telephone. 'You are always going to get people who abuse the system, in any form of healthcare,' says Pusztai. 'It's the same with alcohol. But that doesn't mean that we prohibit access to drugs for most of the people we deal with and the millions who genuinely suffer from obesity and impotence.' </p> <p>Pusztai says that his members would never, for instance, sell the dieting medicine Phentamine, which contains a controlled substance, only the fat-blocker Xenical. 'They say, \"what would happen if an anorexic got hold of some Xenical?\". Well, the answer is nothing, because an anorexic has no fat to block. They might as well have taken a sugar cube.' </p> <p>The irony, says Pusztai, is that 'the sites that offer consumer protections are the visible ones and therefore the ones they're going for, while the rogue sites are going to be difficult for them to get to'. Oppa members are sites with registered real addresses, whereas rogue sites have cyber-addresses only. </p> <p>Ironically, most online prescribers, who offer consultations with US or foreign doctors and reject some applications, had set up OPPA just as the government clampdown began, to campaign for regulation of the online medical business and cut out the cowboys. </p> <p>Clinton's legislation aims to throttle the frontier-less nature of the internet, deploying laws that forbid pharmacies to deal beyond the borders of the state in which they operate. 'What the FDA is doing, however,' says Pusztai, 'is to use this in order to control the practice of medicine, which it has no right to do'. </p> <p>The government's position is that a prescription is 'illegal' if the patient and doctor have not met face to face. One woman whose firm is under investigation counters: 'If you go to a doctor in New York City, you fill out forms that are less rigorous than ours, and you can lie. You don't need to go to a doctor to know if you're impotent, and if you do he won't do a physical examination to find out'. </p> <p>If the legislation passes Congress it will have global ramifications - including for Britain. It bans dealing with providers in the US 'or abroad'. The $500,000 fine is just enough to enable the US to apply for extradition. </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.viagra.com\">www.viagra.com</a></p>",

The government insists that the drugs - especially Xenica and Viagra - are abused by people who do not need them medically for slimming or sexual recreation. It says patients fall victim to 'cowboy' websites. Officials cite the proliferation of Viagra in clubland, and claims the drug is being sold to buyers and administered to patients who simply fill in online questionnaires. The senior policy chief at the administration, William Hubbard, testified to Congress during hearings last month that 'illegal dispensing of prescription drugs poses a serious threat to the health and safety of American citizens'. Meanwhile, besieged prescribers and online doctors have formed OPPA - the Online Prescription Providers' Association - whose director Anton Pusztai retorts: 'Where are the victims? We read and read about the victims of obesity, arthritis, impotence and allergies, but where are the victims of these drugs?' Pusztai says, as with Prohibition and abortion, the closing down of legitimate sites that provide consultations with doctors will only 'give the rogues and the cowboys the break they need'. The providers want a list of drugs that do not contain 'controlled substances' on the internet, with guarantees of proper medical consultation online or by telephone. 'You are always going to get people who abuse the system, in any form of healthcare,' says Pusztai. 'It's the same with alcohol. But that doesn't mean that we prohibit access to drugs for most of the people we deal with and the millions who genuinely suffer from obesity and impotence.' Pusztai says that his members would never, for instance, sell the dieting medicine Phentamine, which contains a controlled substance, only the fat-blocker Xenical. 'They say, \"what would happen if an anorexic got hold of some Xenical?\". Well, the answer is nothing, because an anorexic has no fat to block. They might as well have taken a sugar cube.' The irony, says Pusztai, is that 'the sites that offer consumer protections are the visible ones and therefore the ones they're going for, while the rogue sites are going to be difficult for them to get to'. Oppa members are sites with registered real addresses, whereas rogue sites have cyber-addresses only. Ironically, most online prescribers, who offer consultations with US or foreign doctors and reject some applications, had set up OPPA just as the government clampdown began, to campaign for regulation of the online medical business and cut out the cowboys. Clinton's legislation aims to throttle the frontier-less nature of the internet, deploying laws that forbid pharmacies to deal beyond the borders of the state in which they operate. 'What the FDA is doing, however,' says Pusztai, 'is to use this in order to control the practice of medicine, which it has no right to do'. The government's position is that a prescription is 'illegal' if the patient and doctor have not met face to face. One woman whose firm is under investigation counters: 'If you go to a doctor in New York City, you fill out forms that are less rigorous than ours, and you can lie. You don't need to go to a doctor to know if you're impotent, and if you do he won't do a physical examination to find out'. If the legislation passes Congress it will have global ramifications - including for Britain. It bans dealing with providers in the US 'or abroad'. The $500,000 fine is just enough to enable the US to apply for extradition. Useful links: www.viagra.com",
