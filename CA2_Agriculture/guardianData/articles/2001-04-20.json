Basically, all of us here in the US are getting pretty damn tired of France . . . So I was wondering if the British Army would want to declare war on France with us. </p> <p>BAB: (chuckles) Well, you never know. It could happen. </p> <p>Our man, it has to be said, recovers his diplomatic poise, even when goaded to the limits: \"But if they really get on your nerves,\" continues Loew, \"if they really start in with the 'Allo, my name eez Frenchy, we do not want your steenky beef'. . .\" The Army's ad hoc spokesman cuts in with: \"Then we'll know where to come. Straight away. As we always do.\" </p> <p>Indeed. So revealing is that last comment that you wonder whether Loew has made it up to prove a point. One suspects not. Loew might be technically lying when he pretends to be a gay hairdresser trying to join the US Air Force, or a man who has just shot his foot off when he calls the Flower Essence Alternative Therapy Centre for a holistic approach to his injury (\"if you have a homeopathic remedy arnica, you could take that\"); but the air of veracity, by which I mean fully and accurately transcribed conversations, clings to this book. </p> <p>Ringing the hospital where he was born, outraged that he no longer has a foreskin and demanding it back, he is patiently informed that the decision to circumcise him was taken by his parents. The next call in the book is to his parents. He tells his mother he is calling because of his outrage that he no longer has a foreskin, etc, and the first thing she says is: \"Are you taping this for your book?\" The resulting transcript is extraordinary, even for those of you who are used to full and frank exchanges between yourselves and your folks. Or the other way around. </p> <p>There are 26 prank phone calls here, and not all of them come off. But those that do, do so with a brutal logic that is a joy to behold. Loew (who is a staffer on The Onion , the extraordinarily droll American satirical publication) seems to have taken some Method-type pains to get into the personae of the people he is impersonating. Not that some victims appreciate his thoroughness: when he probes the director of a Gated Community (a high-security estate for rich, paranoid Americans) about residents' security arrangements, the gag is that she only realizes she is dealing with a thief when he signs off by saying: \"I should get going now, because I have to come down there and take all your shit.\" </p> <p>This is both a thoughtful and a puerile book. Who or what, you may ask, is being served when a man rings up a church bookstore and asks if they stock any \"Christian pornography\" for himself and his wife? Or rings up a hospital and offers to donate his own nipples? Our own amusement, that's what.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When Ian Rankin created John Rebus, the Edinburgh Detective Inspector he has followed through 12 books now, Rebus was 38, liked a drink, and had one dark buried secret, from his days in the army, that returned to haunt him. But with each book, Rebus's ghosts, and Rankin's interest in the skeletons mouldering under Edinburgh's haughty surface, have grown, till the series no longer seems about solving crimes, but investigating one man's soul and one city - even modern Scotland itself. </p> <p> Black &amp; Blue (1997) was the turning point, as Rankin borrowed James Ellroy's staccato style and ambition to interweave the return of Scotland's most mythic uncaptured criminal, the 1960s sex killer Bible John; corruption flowing in from the offshore oil industry to the police force of which Rebus is a compromised member; and Rebus's attempt to shake his worsening alcoholism. It moved from Edinburgh's shadowy steepness - \"a precipitous city . . . its inhabitants falling slowly, almost imperceptibly\" - to the Sullum Voe oilfield in the Hebrides (\"a sci-fi city transported to prehistory\"), and finally to the suburban home. There Bible John kept the evidence of his secret, endless killings from his wife in a rusting attic chest, like Bluebeard. It was a book with epic reach. </p> <p>The bodies and ghosts have piled up since - a possible Nazi war criminal, a Chechen gangster, and the hit-and-run crippling of Rebus's daughter in The Hanging Garden (1998); inherited paedophile behaviour, a returning serial killer, and Rebus's teenage hopes remembered too late in Dead Souls (1999); a literal skeleton under the Scottish parliament in Set in Darkness (2000); a chain of headless corpses stretching back perhaps to Edinburgh's sinful city fathers Burke and Hare in the new The Falls. Rebus has got older, wearier, sitting in an empty shell of a flat, with alcohol and old records his companions. He confuses \"comfort and oblivion\"; he is \"a failed human being\". </p> <p>\"The basic tenet of the books is, it's impossible to escape history,\" says Rankin, a wry, unassuming 40-year-old. \"Especially living in Edinburgh, and living in Scotland, you can never throw off the shackles of the past.\" </p> <p>John Hannah played Rebus in a TV adaptation of Black &amp; Blue , with four more films to follow this year, and the books' now automatic bestseller status here is spreading worldwide. Rankin's own history ties him not just to Edinburgh, but to the small Fife town of Cardenden, a birthplace he has Rebus share. A coal-mining town till the mines shut when Rankin was a child, and employment and hope bled from his surroundings, he escaped into his imagination - making his own comics, writing his own lyrics for favourite bands, both providing \"alternative worlds\". </p> <p>\"Can,\" he adds, ventriloquizing his young self, \"the world really be as grey as it looks ? Can it not be Technicolor?\" He read pulp paperbacks - Ernest Tidyman's Shaft series, The Godfather - then, at 15, started writing himself, learning from McEwan, Kerouac, and Solzhenitzyn. </p> <p>When not reading and writing in his bedroom, building his own secret identity, he hung around with Cardenden's bored teenage gangs, blending into his background. Many of his friends left like Rebus, by joining the army. Rankin himself went to Edinburgh University, and studied literature. </p> <p>His first novel, The Flood (1986), was a thinly disguised, \"literary\" look at Cardenden, but it was his father's reading of thrillers, and a working-class desire not to be a \"subsidised writer\", that turned him to crime. He made the middle-aged Rebus \"different from me in so many ways\", he thought at first. But, as he explains with brutal honesty, the character has become too close for comfort. </p> <p>\"I think his darkness was in me from the beginning. I'm probably closer to him now than when I started the series. There was a period of me getting to know him, and him getting to know me. He does a lot of the things I'd like to do but daren't. I keep myself in control, most of the time, and let him run. When my second son was born seriously disabled, the first thing I did was put Rebus's daughter in a wheelchair. Well, you can call that therapy. Or you can call that malevolence. I felt better when I'd got him with his kid unable to walk. I was using him like a punchbag. And I still do. </p> <p>\"But there's still very dark stuff in me that hasn't come out. And whether it will or not I don't know. I mean how dark do you go, how deep do you take it, without it affecting you ? There's a lot of stuff I don't want people to find out about me till after I'm dead. Things I've done, things I've thought. Things I think I'm capable of doing. He can draw things out of me as I write. A literary scholar is writing a book about Black &amp; Blue now. I'm terrified about what she may think she's found, that I didn't know was there.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, he's planning a break from Rebus in two years' time. And he has already sketched the series' end. \"There's always the potential in Rebus for violence. It's why I often play him off against Cafferty, a criminal who's like him. Like Cain and Abel, they could annihilate each other. I think that's how things will finish.\"</p>",

The newest trend is the wacky science subject. If there is a market for books about cryptography, chronometry or even cod - and books on all these subjects have sold well in the last decade - then there is no reason why any subject should seem intrinsically boring.

After all, there aren't any galaxies stretched on the skin of unimaginably vast cod. Nor do physicists speak of the world arising from fluctuation in the quantum codfish.

That's pretty frothy, too. </p> <p>In fact, Universal Foam runs into another current publishing style: the book of lists. First, list every-thing that might be frothy in the universe, from galaxies through cuckoo-spit to styrofoam. Among the subjects covered here are volcanoes, shaving cream, champagne, fire-fighting equipment and meringues. Then you list everything that you know about everything in the first list: 101 important facts about galaxies; 20 things you never knew about cappuccino; the seven principles of highly effective styrofoam, and so on. There is a trick missed here, since Universal Foam contains only 10 or 11 facts about styrofoam. Perhaps the most important one is that the stuff they put coffee into is actually a different sort of plastic. It contains even less information about how they put the bubbles into Coca-Cola. Finally, all this is wrapped up in the academic style, as old as exams, where you simply cram in all the knowledge that you can possibly get hold of and regurgitate it with the echoing solemnity of a TV anchorman on The Simpsons : \"That suggests a rhetorical question: 'Can everyday foams, like milk foam, ever be fully understood and controlled?' The answer seems to be, understood, yes; fully controlled, perhaps not.\" At this point, there was foam flecking the gibbering reviewer's lips. </p> <p>This style is - oh God, I can't help it - another example of packaging foam, or \"peanuts\" as Americans call them. This, we learn, comes in several colours, depending on whether it has been made from recycled foams, or specially treated to reduce static electricity. There are 45m pounds of this interesting substance created every year in the United States. You will even learn from this book the names of the three largest companies making the stuff and its characteristic shapes. </p> <p>Can this really be what one reviewer meant when he said, as the blurb proudly quotes, that Universal Foam would supply endless material for dinner-party conversations? Are these the materials of bubbling wit? You can't really blame the author, Sidney Perkowitz. He has worked hard; he writes clearly. It is not his fault that he has nothing particular to say after he has got through the bits that actually interest him, which are the fairly technical discussions of how to measure foams and describe them mathematically. </p> <p>This book has been not so much written as extruded, along with uncountable others.

My friend was rightly chuffed and it became something of a joke between us, partly because I was jealous and partly because it's a weird idea. I mean, can you \"wear\" erudition at all? </p> <p>I don't for one moment doubt the erudition of Meaghan Delahunt's conscientious, semi-factual novel about Trotsky's exile in Mexico. The trouble is, she wears it like chain mail, clunking around in it with deafening lack of conviction. Which is a shame, because she has manfully attempted something gargantuan, especially for a first-timer. But novels based on history carry a double burden. They must first justify themselves (what does fiction bring to this that a biog doesn't?) and then, having weighed themselves down with all that research, dare to shrug it off. A meticulous \"factual\" novel must feel as loose and light as any tale pulled from thin air. Facts, especially famous ones, must be subtly introduced, like a hand slipped into yours while you're deep in thought: warm, sweet, barely noticeable. </p> <p>And Delahunt's facts are big ones: the Russian Revolution, the tragedy of Trotsky's exile and assassination, the slower, less heroic death of Stalin. She also charts the odd relationship between the sexually wistful Trotsky, his gentle, long-suffering wife and the fiery Frida Kahlo, who goes to bed with him to make her husband (the womanising Diego Rivera) jealous. </p> <p>You feel impressed at how painstakingly Delahunt must have structured her narrative to make the sliding timescales work, so that the gobbets of history line up and the conflicting viewpoints ricochet off one another. But you begin to wish she were less conscientious - that she'd let go occasionally. So bent is she on driving home her facts, her dates, her understanding of the period, that every one of her half a dozen narrators sounds identical. So many italics; so many enigmatic, one-line paras; so many touchy-feely phrases. Can she possibly intend that Trotsky, his executioner and Stalin all speak like intense and dreamy women? </p> <p>Instead of honing his ice pick, Ramon the assassin emotes passionately and articulately about Kahlo's paintings. One of Kahlo's lovers reflects on how she made him \"alert to the aches in my life\". Who are these New Men? Why did they waste time electrifying the Soviet Union when they clearly had such promising careers ahead of them as Virago novelists? </p> <p>But even more fatal is the relentless way Delahunt lobs her history at us. So many dates, so little time. In case we get lost, characters conveniently lie down on divans and \"remember\" for us. Trotsky helpfully recalls precisely what radio music he listened to and, like a bolshevik Sue Lawley, when it was performed and by whom. He recalls how \"when living in a French villa by the sea in 1933\" they had \"the writer Andr\u00e9 Malraux\" drop in. Why not just Malraux or even Andr\u00e9? This is Hello! captioning, not fiction. These staged memories and forced flashbacks are the literary equivalent of the ripply TV screen: laughable, old-fashioned and unnecessary. </p> <p>And though she was clearly into colour, paint and sex, Frida Kahlo must have thought about other things now and then. Though it may not have been half so convenient for the novelist, it might have benefited the overall vivacity and credibility of the novel if, just for once, we'd seen the artist do something as simple as boil an egg without having to contemplate a) colour theory, b) Trotsky and world revolution or c) her place in history, while the rusty water bubbled.</p>",

He recalls how \"when living in a French villa by the sea in 1933\" they had \"the writer Andr\u00e9 Malraux\" drop in. Why not just Malraux or even Andr\u00e9? This is Hello! captioning, not fiction. These staged memories and forced flashbacks are the literary equivalent of the ripply TV screen: laughable, old-fashioned and unnecessary. And though she was clearly into colour, paint and sex, Frida Kahlo must have thought about other things now and then. Though it may not have been half so convenient for the novelist, it might have benefited the overall vivacity and credibility of the novel if, just for once, we'd seen the artist do something as simple as boil an egg without having to contemplate a) colour theory, b) Trotsky and world revolution or c) her place in history, while the rusty water bubbled.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Fiasco of waiting for Woolwich payments</strong></p> <p>In November 1993, following pressure from a mortgage adviser who told me I had no alternative, I took out a Woolwich endowment mortgage. In August 2000, after reading Jobs &amp; Money articles which led me to believe I had been wrongly advised, I complained. </p> <p>This was difficult as I was initially told I could not have a complaints form as \"you can't complain just because the policy was not worth what you hoped.\" </p> <p>But I insisted. On November 13 2000, I received an offer of compensation because my policy \"may have been inappropriate\". We reached an agreement on the amount on January 4. </p> <p> I asked for both the endowment proceeds and the compensation to be paid directly into my mortgage account. But since then, it has been a comedy of errors. I have been quoted between \u00a3166 and \u00a3261 as my new payment. I discovered some of my money was incorrectly actioned as advance mortgage payments, rather than part payment of capital. And there is a catalogue of other probems. Calls are not returned. Can you help? I want to sell my flat. <br><strong>AP, Nottingham</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Your letter shows the importance of persisting in your demands - all too often low-level call centre staff try to fob off customers. But the Woolwich has put its hand up admitted its error, and apologised. </p> <p> The proceeds from the endowment policy and compensation were paid directly to your mortgage back in January, but the amount was not subtracted from your loan. </p> <p>This would have continued for a year had you not noticed it. Then after you protested, a Woolwich operation did not backdate correctly - leading to your justified annoyance. Woolwich will now backdate the payments correctly, they will work out the right payment and ensure you do not lose out financially. </p> <p>I trust they will send an ex gratia payment to cover your time and costs. </p> <p><strong> Trying to surrender two endowments</strong> </p> <p> I have held two Legal &amp; General endowment policies since the mid-80s, neither of which is now connected to mortgages. I have been attempting to surrender them since January to pay for a deposit on a new home, on which we have now exchanged contracts. But L&amp;G has continually failed to send me the correct information and necessary forms. </p> <p>It has been a continual round of L&amp;G promising and then failing to contact me. It took some fuss to get any sort of valuation - and this was wrong because it ignored January payments. </p> <p>After three months, this has resulted in being promised the forms four times by post and three by fax, but I have received only one by post. </p> <p>I tried to sidestep L&amp;G by going to a policy dealer, Surrendalink, but because I had borrowed against the policy, they ceased showing any interest. </p> <p>Can you help? I want to avoid a bridging loan. <br><strong> JM, Middlesex </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Surrendering rather than selling a life policy produces less but should be speedy. In this case, you have had the worst of both worlds. L&amp;G has been incompetent and the policy dealer less than helpful - when did dealers ever warn of this problem? </p> <p>But when Capital Letters took up your problem with L&amp;G, the insurer did have the good grace to admit its serial errors. </p> <p>They have now processed your surrender value and the money should be with you just in time for your new home purchase. L&amp;G says it originally issued the necessary paperwork towards the end of January but then had to reissue the papers at the end of March, after which it seems the process has been as normal. </p> <p>The life company says it is \"not clear from the files\" why this two-month delay happened - hardly satisfactory when a five-figure sum is involved. Its initial assumption, of course, was that the customer was at fault - a conclusion that hardly coincides with the detail of your dealings sent to Capital Letters. But it admits it should have reacted sooner. </p> <p>As for the loan, surely a multi-billion pound company can cope with that. L&amp;G has apologised and is offering a \u00a350 ex gratia payment for the inconvenience caused. Let's hope it learns from this. </p> <p> <strong> Am I due a payout on energy shares? </strong></p> <p> I have just discovered a share certificate for 102 Southern Electric shares. I know they merged with Scottish Hydro in 1998. What am I due and what should I do to collect it? <br><strong> RF, Middlesex</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Holders of Southern shares received new shares in the ratio of one old for one new share in what is now Scottish and Southern Energy in September 1998. If you do not have a new certificate, write to the company at 200, Dunkeld Rd, Perth, Scotland PH1 3AQ. But check first to see if you have a certificate from the new company. You may have been sent one, in which case your old certificate has no financial value. </p> <p>\u0095 Got a problem? We want to hear about it. Get in touch with Tony Levene here at Jobs &amp; Money and we will try to help.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fiasco of waiting for Woolwich payments In November 1993, following pressure from a mortgage adviser who told me I had no alternative, I took out a Woolwich endowment mortgage. In August 2000, after reading Jobs &amp; Money articles which led me to believe I had been wrongly advised, I complained. This was difficult as I was initially told I could not have a complaints form as \"you can't complain just because the policy was not worth what you hoped.\" But I insisted. On November 13 2000, I received an offer of compensation because my policy \"may have been inappropriate\". We reached an agreement on the amount on January 4. I asked for both the endowment proceeds and the compensation to be paid directly into my mortgage account. But since then, it has been a comedy of errors. I have been quoted between \u00a3166 and \u00a3261 as my new payment. I discovered some of my money was incorrectly actioned as advance mortgage payments, rather than part payment of capital. And there is a catalogue of other probems. Calls are not returned. Can you help? I want to sell my flat. AP, Nottingham \u0095 Your letter shows the importance of persisting in your demands - all too often low-level call centre staff try to fob off customers. But the Woolwich has put its hand up admitted its error, and apologised. The proceeds from the endowment policy and compensation were paid directly to your mortgage back in January, but the amount was not subtracted from your loan. This would have continued for a year had you not noticed it. Then after you protested, a Woolwich operation did not backdate correctly - leading to your justified annoyance. Woolwich will now backdate the payments correctly, they will work out the right payment and ensure you do not lose out financially. I trust they will send an ex gratia payment to cover your time and costs. Trying to surrender two endowments I have held two Legal &amp; General endowment policies since the mid-80s, neither of which is now connected to mortgages. I have been attempting to surrender them since January to pay for a deposit on a new home, on which we have now exchanged contracts. But L&amp;G has continually failed to send me the correct information and necessary forms. It has been a continual round of L&amp;G promising and then failing to contact me. It took some fuss to get any sort of valuation - and this was wrong because it ignored January payments. After three months, this has resulted in being promised the forms four times by post and three by fax, but I have received only one by post. I tried to sidestep L&amp;G by going to a policy dealer, Surrendalink, but because I had borrowed against the policy, they ceased showing any interest. Can you help? I want to avoid a bridging loan. JM, Middlesex \u0095 Surrendering rather than selling a life policy produces less but should be speedy. In this case, you have had the worst of both worlds. L&amp;G has been incompetent and the policy dealer less than helpful - when did dealers ever warn of this problem? But when Capital Letters took up your problem with L&amp;G, the insurer did have the good grace to admit its serial errors. They have now processed your surrender value and the money should be with you just in time for your new home purchase. L&amp;G says it originally issued the necessary paperwork towards the end of January but then had to reissue the papers at the end of March, after which it seems the process has been as normal. The life company says it is \"not clear from the files\" why this two-month delay happened - hardly satisfactory when a five-figure sum is involved. Its initial assumption, of course, was that the customer was at fault - a conclusion that hardly coincides with the detail of your dealings sent to Capital Letters. But it admits it should have reacted sooner. As for the loan, surely a multi-billion pound company can cope with that. L&amp;G has apologised and is offering a \u00a350 ex gratia payment for the inconvenience caused. Let's hope it learns from this. Am I due a payout on energy shares? I have just discovered a share certificate for 102 Southern Electric shares. I know they merged with Scottish Hydro in 1998. What am I due and what should I do to collect it? RF, Middlesex \u0095 Holders of Southern shares received new shares in the ratio of one old for one new share in what is now Scottish and Southern Energy in September 1998. If you do not have a new certificate, write to the company at 200, Dunkeld Rd, Perth, Scotland PH1 3AQ. But check first to see if you have a certificate from the new company. You may have been sent one, in which case your old certificate has no financial value. \u0095 Got a problem? We want to hear about it. Get in touch with Tony Levene here at Jobs &amp; Money and we will try to help.",

But Mr Filer was taken on before the results of the 50-question telephone test relating to his work and personal life had been returned. Yesterday B&amp;Q said management at the store were at fault for offering him the job before the results were known, but its representatives would be willing to meet Mr Filer and might offer to re-employ him. </p> <p>Mr Filer said: \"How could I go back and work for a company like that?

B&amp;Q does not recognise unions, to which its attitude was described as \"not supportive\". </p> <p>\"The ridiculous thing about this case is that the guy is obviously good at his job and has proved it but the test says he's unsuitable,\" a spokesman said. \"It simply makes a nonsense of psychometric testing. The idea that it's a foolproof and accurate way of selecting employees is simply wrong. </p> <p>\"When we talk to employers they stress the need for flexibility in the workforce, for split shifts and short-term contracts, but when it comes to these decisions they are totally rigid. Retail is a people business and if he's a good people person then this decision is a nonsense.\" </p> <p>Personality tests such as the one Mr Filer failed are becoming more common as employers seek quickly and cheaply to identify the most promising applicants. </p> <p>According to the Industrial Society there are around 5,000 tests used in the selection of more than 50% of managers. Even for technical jobs where professional qualifications are relevant, psychometric testing is used in 37% of cases. </p> <p>Theo Blackwell, a policy specialist at the Industrial Society, said the tests were a valid part of the selection process: \"They can be a useful tool for achieving balance in the workforce and choosing the right employee.

Huynh Cong 'Nick' Ut won a Pulitzer Prize for this. </p> <p>The wars went on so long that the show is like a roll call of famous war correspondents. Robert Capa, who made his name in the Spanish civil war and died in Vietnam in 1954, is there. So too is Larry Burrows, who was killed in Laos in 1970.

The Argentinian tenor-cum-heart-throb is back at Covent Garden as Verdi's Otello, breathing new life into Elijah Moshinsky's well-worn production, and his performance, predictably, is unlike anything we've experienced in the opera before. His Otello is a beguiling creature, at once sensual and innocent. There's little intimation of the glittering warrior. His first appearance - bounding down the gangplank of his ship, dishevelled, shirt open to the waist, pectorals bulging - suggests sexual rather than military conquest. In what follows, you're sometimes left wondering how the man attained the position of political responsibility that he holds. </p> <p>Where Cura scores high, however, is in the erotic blatancy of his depiction of Otello's desire for Desdemona, which remains unquenchable even after Iago's insinuations have done their work. Calling her a whore, he sexually attacks her. Before he wakes her to kill her, he lets the shadow of his hand run over her crotch, while the murder itself carries disturbing implications of rape. Vocally, he's beautiful, virile and athletic, if occasionally unsubtle, not always employing the wide range of tone colour he uses elsewhere. </p> <p>He is pitted against the equally formidable Iago of Alexandru Agache. Physically, Agache is stolid, unprepossessing, very much \"honest Iago\" rather than some malevolent force. The danger lies in the seditious, velvety beauty of his voice, which seduces as well as poisons. His description of Cassio's imagined nocturnal fantasies have a luscious, prurient obscenity. It's not surprising that Otello is so easily duped. </p> <p>Amanda Roocroft's Desdemona isn't quite in their league, however. She suggests a girlish, shatterable fragility that sits uneasily with the score. Verdi and his librettist Boito excised from Shakespeare much of the knowing bawdry that characterises Desdemona, replacing it with music of tremendous dignity and self-assurance. Roocroft, however, remains drippy and waif-like, while her voice doesn't always have the necessary weight to allow Verdi's lines to flow with the ease that they should. </p> <p>The casting elsewhere is luxurious - Kurt Streit (no less) as Cassio, gorgeously vapid, and conveying just enough sexual charisma to give genuine grounds for suspicion. In the pit, Daniele Gatti drives the score hard, at times too much so. There's plenty of electricity, nervous energy and dramatic fire, but he's unyielding in places; the act one love scene in particular seems markedly lacking in tenderness. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep until May 3.

      "body": "<p>When high profile independent financial advice firm Holden Meehan sold Londoner Tania Shishkin an insurance policy six years ago, she was grateful for the protection it offered. </p> <p>But earlier this year, Ms Shishkin was shocked to discover that the \u00a31,100 she had paid in premiums was completely unnecessary, as she had been covered under her company scheme for the entire period. </p> <p>And when she demanded compensation from Holden Meehan, the firm ignored her protests, despite the fact that it had earned \u00a3209 commission from the sale. </p> <p>She also found that she had slipped through a regulatory loophole, leaving her unable to complain of mis-selling either to the IFA or the ombudsman. But this week Jobs &amp; Money stepped in, and the firm has now offered Ms Shishkin compensation. </p> <p>In 1994, Ms Shishkin, an art editor with a medical magazine, needed a mortgage. She went to Amanda Davidson, a director of Holden Meehan, which focuses on ethical investment advice. </p> <p>\"I was 33 at the time. I had a two-year-old child and I chose this firm on the recommendation of a work colleague. It was my first ever mortgage,\" she says. </p> <p>Ms Davidson helped her select a home loan and a life insurance policy to back it. Ms Shishkin remains happy with the loan and cover advice. </p> <p>\"Then she asked me whether I had considered how I would keep up my mortgage payments if I fell seriously ill.

      "bodyText": "When high profile independent financial advice firm Holden Meehan sold Londoner Tania Shishkin an insurance policy six years ago, she was grateful for the protection it offered. But earlier this year, Ms Shishkin was shocked to discover that the \u00a31,100 she had paid in premiums was completely unnecessary, as she had been covered under her company scheme for the entire period. And when she demanded compensation from Holden Meehan, the firm ignored her protests, despite the fact that it had earned \u00a3209 commission from the sale. She also found that she had slipped through a regulatory loophole, leaving her unable to complain of mis-selling either to the IFA or the ombudsman. But this week Jobs &amp; Money stepped in, and the firm has now offered Ms Shishkin compensation. In 1994, Ms Shishkin, an art editor with a medical magazine, needed a mortgage. She went to Amanda Davidson, a director of Holden Meehan, which focuses on ethical investment advice. \"I was 33 at the time. I had a two-year-old child and I chose this firm on the recommendation of a work colleague. It was my first ever mortgage,\" she says. Ms Davidson helped her select a home loan and a life insurance policy to back it. Ms Shishkin remains happy with the loan and cover advice. \"Then she asked me whether I had considered how I would keep up my mortgage payments if I fell seriously ill. She recommended that I think about taking out a permanent health insurance (PHI) policy,\" says Ms Shishkin. PHI pays out a proportion of the monthly wage if the holder cannot work through illness after a preset period - anything from a month to a year - until the holder's retirement date, if necessary. The payout is usually fixed at 50% of the monthly salary. \"I had never heard of PHI but since I had a child and was not given to any kind of financial risk, I decided to sign up just in case,\" she adds. Ms Davidson recommended a \u00a314.57 a month plan with Permanent Insurance, a specialist in this area.

      "body": "<p>The first day after skydiving I'd been determined to choose one of Queenstown's less adrenalin-heavy activities as a way of winding down. The great thing about this town is that there's so much going on we only had to book activities on the morning or the night before we wanted to do them, and our hostel reception was always able to do this for us. So, with no effort or pre-planning, we decided to go horse-riding for a couple of hours that afternoon. </p> <p>At 1pm a van, smelling strongly of horses, picked us up from outside the hostel and drove us an hour out of Queenstown to Glenorchy, a picturesque, farm-oriented area. There were just four of us trekking that afternoon, and we were all at&nbsp;the \"been on a horse a couple of times eight years ago\" stage, which made it even better. We were each allocated a horse and, although I was a little&nbsp;disturbed by the size of mine,&nbsp;I soon got used to the relaxing feel of being in a saddle as our horses ambled along the road one behind another. </p> <p>The start of the ride was peaceful enough, but the second we went off-road, everything changed. At one point we were allowed to run our horses uphill which was a wonderful feeling with the wind rushing past our ears&nbsp;- although not for Josh, whose horse had decided that any speed faster than a walk was a bad idea. The afternoon ended with a few unexpected dramas - one of the horses got temperamental and kicked both Josh's and my horse, which put them on edge for the rest of the journey. On several occasions I nearly fell off, so I was quite relieved to get on to firm ground again! That's one tip for anyone going on a horse trek: unless you're particularly experienced, only book a short ride. After over two hours I was very sore indeed. </p> <p>On Friday, a combination of extreme stiffness and the money-vacuum that is Queenstown meant Josh and I spent the day quietly wandering through the woods by the lake. This was our last day in Queenstown before heading for Milford Sound and we decided to make it a relaxing one. In the afternoon we saw Dungeons &amp; Dragons at the cinema - my advice is: don't bother. It was laughably bad. As it was Good Friday,&nbsp;the Queenstown nightlife was alive and kicking - more so than normal - and we left the place on a fun note. &nbsp;</p> <p>On Saturday we took an early bus to Milford Sound. We'd been desperately keen to hire a car and do the trip ourselves but age discrimination (you have to be over 21) meant that this was not to be. There was nothing wrong with the bus as such, but in retrospect I would definitely recommend hiring a car if you're old enough - Milford is very isolated, and a vehicle would have given us added freedom to explore at leisure. Ah well. </p> <p>Thrown in with our bus-ride was a cruise of the fjords, which we took straight after we arrived in Milford. I think the worst thing was the realisation that some people were going to finish this cruise then head straight off to Queenstown again. What a waste. Admittedly we saw some lovely scenery -&nbsp;the fast-flowing waterfalls down the mountains are a pretty spectacular sight -&nbsp; but I how can you feel the character of a place if you spend the whole day on various vehicles? I'd certainly recommend staying at least a night if you have time. &nbsp;</p> <p>After our cruise we had a 40-minute, heavily burdened walk to the lodge, due to some dodgy advice from a tourist information lady. When we arrived I realised how absolutely freezing the place is. Luckily we were able to hire duvets as neither me or Josh owned a sleeping bag, but there was still the outside run to the toilets and shower to contend with. The lodge did have a little shop and restauraunt but we'd brought our own groceries which meant we enjoyed the culinary delights of jacket potatoes with cheese and beans. The evening was largely spent in the warm&nbsp;communal lounge - where my pack of cards came in&nbsp;extremely handy. The electricity generator switched off at 11pm - unsurprisingly, not much happened after that! &nbsp; </p> <p>On Easter Sunday we'd booked an afternoon's sea-kayaking on the Sound, but it wasn't until the afternoon, so in the morning we walked round the little town - and little was the operative word. This place exists almost solely for tourism. We headed to another spectacular waterfall and the site of two small graves, one commemorating a recent air accident of several youngsters, before returning to the lodge for our kayak pick-up. We'd booked with Rosco's Kayaking, which was run by a guy named Horey. Following the leaflet's advice we'd tried to bring all the right gear, but we needn't have bothered - Horey provided everything except your underwear. </p> <p>There were eight of us plus Horey in four double-kayaks. The weather was rainy and misty which was to be expected as Milford is one of the wettest places in the world - it rains for 50% of the year. Due to this the water became rougher the further out we paddled - and it was then that something horrible happened. Me and Josh had been having a few teething problems (basically we made terrible kayak partners), and suddenly a spell of bad waves completely broke my water confidence, which was still low from Coogee. I had an attack of water phobia, which was unlike anything I've felt before - I couldn't stop shaking in my kayak and I actually felt nauseous. In the end, the two of us headed for shore again while the others continued, and Horey said we could transfer to the morning ride the next day, when the water is much calmer.&nbsp;To be honest,&nbsp;that's the one we probably should have done in the first place, but I couldn't help feeling embarrassed. It was incredibly frustrating, as I've always enjoyed water activities in the past. Has anybody else experienced something like this? What's the cure? </p> <p>Later that evening as I was stirring some beans in the kitchen, I noticed a large antenna wriggling at me, poking out from under the lid of an enormous saucepan. Several men were busy cooking live crayfish and the box of them still wriggling at me feet was a pretty unusual sight. There were many fishers at the lodge who would drive their boats down every morning, and this was part of their catch. One of the men gave me a piece of smoked blue cod to try and it was absolutely delicious. I promised to buy myself a beginners' cookbook when I returned to Australia. &nbsp; </p> <p>Our last day in Milford was slightly frustrating as we had to wait until 3pm to catch a bus. It gave us time to wander in the opposite direction besides the river and enjoy the stunning visuals combined with the unusual sight of blue skies and sun. It also gave us the chance to be eaten by flies again. Two bits of advice - either have a decent, strong repellent that's 100% deet (though don't get it near your mouth or you'll foam, as I found out in the Blue Mountains) or become a smoker, as they won't go near cigarettes. That evening we returned to our hostel in Queenstown with the intention of an overnight stop, but were alarmed to discover that all buses to Christchurch were full the next day - apparently it was a late Easter rush. So, we had to revise our plans and book another night in Queenstown - not exactly what we'd intended, but at least it was a great town to be stuck in. &nbsp;</p> <p> On the Tuesday we woke late, and treated ourself to lunch and a bottle of wine at Old Man Rock cafe, where we sat outside andwatched the world go by - a lovely way to spend an afternoon. After that, under the influence of alcohol, we decided to go shopping (a bad thing), then spent the rest of the day enjoying the place. Maybe another day there wasn't such a bad thing. &nbsp;</p> <p>The next day we finally managed to move on, with an eight-hour bus ride to Christchurch. Again it was frustrating not to be driving, as we passed some beautiful places where we'd have loved to have got out, but it wasn't to be. In Christchurch we were met by a friend of Josh's - that evening we were to have the luxury of staying in a house!! The family were incredibly hospitable and made us a huge dinner. We chatted on various topics: travel (they advised us not to go to Greymouth), university (how bad student debt is in New Zealand), even politics (theirs are far funnier than ours). Before I left Australia I felt like I was leaving my home, but now I feel I could stay so much longer in this beautiful, friendly country. But that's travelling for you. &nbsp; Until next week (when I'll be adjusting to Australian living again), &nbsp; Milly</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first day after skydiving I'd been determined to choose one of Queenstown's less adrenalin-heavy activities as a way of winding down. The great thing about this town is that there's so much going on we only had to book activities on the morning or the night before we wanted to do them, and our hostel reception was always able to do this for us. So, with no effort or pre-planning, we decided to go horse-riding for a couple of hours that afternoon. At 1pm a van, smelling strongly of horses, picked us up from outside the hostel and drove us an hour out of Queenstown to Glenorchy, a picturesque, farm-oriented area. There were just four of us trekking that afternoon, and we were all at the \"been on a horse a couple of times eight years ago\" stage, which made it even better. We were each allocated a horse and, although I was a little disturbed by the size of mine, I soon got used to the relaxing feel of being in a saddle as our horses ambled along the road one behind another. The start of the ride was peaceful enough, but the second we went off-road, everything changed. At one point we were allowed to run our horses uphill which was a wonderful feeling with the wind rushing past our ears - although not for Josh, whose horse had decided that any speed faster than a walk was a bad idea. The afternoon ended with a few unexpected dramas - one of the horses got temperamental and kicked both Josh's and my horse, which put them on edge for the rest of the journey. On several occasions I nearly fell off, so I was quite relieved to get on to firm ground again! That's one tip for anyone going on a horse trek: unless you're particularly experienced, only book a short ride. After over two hours I was very sore indeed. On Friday, a combination of extreme stiffness and the money-vacuum that is Queenstown meant Josh and I spent the day quietly wandering through the woods by the lake. This was our last day in Queenstown before heading for Milford Sound and we decided to make it a relaxing one. In the afternoon we saw Dungeons &amp; Dragons at the cinema - my advice is: don't bother. It was laughably bad. As it was Good Friday, the Queenstown nightlife was alive and kicking - more so than normal - and we left the place on a fun note. On Saturday we took an early bus to Milford Sound. We'd been desperately keen to hire a car and do the trip ourselves but age discrimination (you have to be over 21) meant that this was not to be.

      "body": "<p>The bacteriologist Dorothy Millar, who has died aged 60 of a pulmonary embolism, was a respected author and researcher on human skin conditions and a member of the Royal College of Pathologists. She was also a radical Christian and advocate for the poor.</p> <p>Millar was born in Calcutta, the daughter of Scottish missionaries. After her parents returned to Scotland, she was educated in Edinburgh and then in New Zealand, where her father had taken up a post at Otago University, Dunedin. It was at this time that her interest in Maori culture began to develop, along with a questioning of western social values.</p> <p>Her initial post-doctoral work as a bacteriologist was with the distinguished New Zealand scientist Molly Marples, an international authority on the ecology of human skin. With Marples, Millar became involved in research projects in the Pacific islands where exotic fungi carried ringworm and athlete's foot. Together they set up a reference laboratory for identification of these species, and found previously unknown types of parasitic fungus in the Cook Islands. It was while working with families in these islands that she became drawn to the Maoris' strong awareness of community and their sense of the sacred.</p> <p>She returned to England in 1967 and, three years later, while working at St John's Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, in London, she co-authored with Prof Bill Noble, a seminal work, Microbiology of the Human Skin, one of a series of Major Problems in Dermatology under the general authorship of Arthur Rook. In 1974, her research work and numerous publications brought her membership of the Royal College of Pathologists.</p> <p>In 1973, she had married the Rev Dr Peter Millar, then a parish minister in the east end of Glasgow. Dorothy was working at Glasgow University and at the Royal Infirmary in the pathology laboratory, continuing her work on the human skin.</p> <p>While her research continued to grow, she also became increasingly involved with community issues facing families in the parish, which then suffered from social deprivation. Working with local groups, she pushed for better housing and health care. This experience deepened her commitment to work for justice, which she saw as an essential component of the Christian gospel.</p> <p>During these years, she was among the early voices in Britain raised on behalf of reducing debt in the developing countries. She ran regular workshops and liaised with both Christian Aid and Oxfam on Third World issues.</p> <p>In 1976, with her husband, she was appointed to the Church of South India, and during the next 12 years, her sari-clad figure became a familiar sight in many of the villages of Tamil Nadu and in the poorer areas of Chennai (then Madras). Her commitments and concerns in south India ranged through community health to the rights of women. Many of the projects which she helped establish, including care for the elderly and day care centres for young children, were both visionary and pioneering. Above all she remained a companion of the poor, who valued her wisdom and everyday spirituality.</p> <p>Like her friend, the Benedictine monk Bede Griffiths, she said she discovered in India \"the other half of her soul\", but never in a self-enclosed sense. In many parts of the world her authoritative but compassionate voice on matters of development and international aid was valued by those who, like herself, were appalled at the increasing gulf between the poor and the rich in the modern world.</p> <p>She was an advocate of the poor, and lived alongside those for whom she spoke. She was not an admirer of huge aid schemes, which often, in her opinion, further disempowered the exploited and rode roughshod over local culture.</p> <p>After her return to Britain in 1989, her campaigning work increased, and perhaps especially so during her time as a staff member of the Iona Community, when her husband was warden of Iona Abbey. Through her writing and speaking, she became an inspirational person for the thousands of people who were seeking to become more aware of global issues, and her first-hand experience of the developing world gave depth to her words.</p> <p>In the last year of her life, she travelled all over Australia, working on behalf of the Wellspring Community, an ecumenical Christian community inspired by the Iona Community's vision of an engaged Christianity committed to justice and reconciliation. In Australia, she worked for Aboriginal rights and her home in a poor part of Sydney was a place of welcome for many who were on the edge of society. She continued to write and reflect on how cultures remain true to their own identity, yet live within the pluralities of modernity.</p> <p>She is survived by her husband Peter and their children Eldon, Tim and Sulekha.</p> <p>\u0095 Dorothy Ann Millar, bacteriologist and campaigner, born August 29 1940; died March 9 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "The bacteriologist Dorothy Millar, who has died aged 60 of a pulmonary embolism, was a respected author and researcher on human skin conditions and a member of the Royal College of Pathologists. She was also a radical Christian and advocate for the poor. Millar was born in Calcutta, the daughter of Scottish missionaries. After her parents returned to Scotland, she was educated in Edinburgh and then in New Zealand, where her father had taken up a post at Otago University, Dunedin. It was at this time that her interest in Maori culture began to develop, along with a questioning of western social values. Her initial post-doctoral work as a bacteriologist was with the distinguished New Zealand scientist Molly Marples, an international authority on the ecology of human skin. With Marples, Millar became involved in research projects in the Pacific islands where exotic fungi carried ringworm and athlete's foot. Together they set up a reference laboratory for identification of these species, and found previously unknown types of parasitic fungus in the Cook Islands. It was while working with families in these islands that she became drawn to the Maoris' strong awareness of community and their sense of the sacred. She returned to England in 1967 and, three years later, while working at St John's Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, in London, she co-authored with Prof Bill Noble, a seminal work, Microbiology of the Human Skin, one of a series of Major Problems in Dermatology under the general authorship of Arthur Rook. In 1974, her research work and numerous publications brought her membership of the Royal College of Pathologists. In 1973, she had married the Rev Dr Peter Millar, then a parish minister in the east end of Glasgow. Dorothy was working at Glasgow University and at the Royal Infirmary in the pathology laboratory, continuing her work on the human skin. While her research continued to grow, she also became increasingly involved with community issues facing families in the parish, which then suffered from social deprivation. Working with local groups, she pushed for better housing and health care. This experience deepened her commitment to work for justice, which she saw as an essential component of the Christian gospel. During these years, she was among the early voices in Britain raised on behalf of reducing debt in the developing countries. She ran regular workshops and liaised with both Christian Aid and Oxfam on Third World issues. In 1976, with her husband, she was appointed to the Church of South India, and during the next 12 years, her sari-clad figure became a familiar sight in many of the villages of Tamil Nadu and in the poorer areas of Chennai (then Madras). Her commitments and concerns in south India ranged through community health to the rights of women. Many of the projects which she helped establish, including care for the elderly and day care centres for young children, were both visionary and pioneering. Above all she remained a companion of the poor, who valued her wisdom and everyday spirituality. Like her friend, the Benedictine monk Bede Griffiths, she said she discovered in India \"the other half of her soul\", but never in a self-enclosed sense. In many parts of the world her authoritative but compassionate voice on matters of development and international aid was valued by those who, like herself, were appalled at the increasing gulf between the poor and the rich in the modern world. She was an advocate of the poor, and lived alongside those for whom she spoke. She was not an admirer of huge aid schemes, which often, in her opinion, further disempowered the exploited and rode roughshod over local culture. After her return to Britain in 1989, her campaigning work increased, and perhaps especially so during her time as a staff member of the Iona Community, when her husband was warden of Iona Abbey. Through her writing and speaking, she became an inspirational person for the thousands of people who were seeking to become more aware of global issues, and her first-hand experience of the developing world gave depth to her words. In the last year of her life, she travelled all over Australia, working on behalf of the Wellspring Community, an ecumenical Christian community inspired by the Iona Community's vision of an engaged Christianity committed to justice and reconciliation. In Australia, she worked for Aboriginal rights and her home in a poor part of Sydney was a place of welcome for many who were on the edge of society. She continued to write and reflect on how cultures remain true to their own identity, yet live within the pluralities of modernity. She is survived by her husband Peter and their children Eldon, Tim and Sulekha. \u0095 Dorothy Ann Millar, bacteriologist and campaigner, born August 29 1940; died March 9 2001",

      "body": "<p>A frozen tissue mountain, or at least a sizeable mound, is accumulating in the American west, as grieving pet owners send off scraps of flesh from Fido or Cuddles to be turned into an embryo and stored in liquid nitrogen. Human cloning may be officially outlawed and still the province of fringe cults or maverick researchers, but the promise of pet cloning can be yours on production of a credit card. </p> <p>After the cloning of laboratory and farm animals, it is the logical next step and potentially an enormously profitable one. There are an estimated 100m cats and dogs in North America and about 10% die every year. You only need a tiny percentage of owners, rich and/or desperate enough to yearn to recreate those happier days, to generate a sizeable industry. </p> <p>Already there are several web-based firms, such as Canine Cryobank, who will sent you a tissue or blood harvesting kit for about $200 and then charge you another $300 or $400 to turn that into embryos. (Handy tip: if a much loved pet dies before you can take a sample, don't despair.

      "bodyText": "A frozen tissue mountain, or at least a sizeable mound, is accumulating in the American west, as grieving pet owners send off scraps of flesh from Fido or Cuddles to be turned into an embryo and stored in liquid nitrogen. Human cloning may be officially outlawed and still the province of fringe cults or maverick researchers, but the promise of pet cloning can be yours on production of a credit card. After the cloning of laboratory and farm animals, it is the logical next step and potentially an enormously profitable one. There are an estimated 100m cats and dogs in North America and about 10% die every year. You only need a tiny percentage of owners, rich and/or desperate enough to yearn to recreate those happier days, to generate a sizeable industry. Already there are several web-based firms, such as Canine Cryobank, who will sent you a tissue or blood harvesting kit for about $200 and then charge you another $300 or $400 to turn that into embryos. (Handy tip: if a much loved pet dies before you can take a sample, don't despair. Providing you keep the body in the fridge, but not frozen, tissue will remain viable for up to seven days.) DNA from the tissue is then inserted into a denucleated egg, probably taken from a spayed bitch, and allowed to divide until there is a clutch of embryonic cells, which are then frozen.

The school at Northaw, Hertfordshire, reported that although the masked dogs were \"all quite comfortable\" walking and sitting while on patrol, when asked to do anything else they were useless: \"Completely confused when asked to work on a/c of the intake of air coming from under the chin, no direct scent can reach the nose, and it appears that if it did the container filter would be faulty. If the filter was removed the dog knew there was someone about, but could get no sense of direction,\" said the report, which has remained secret for more than 50 years. \"Conclusion: Masks invaluable in gas attack when dogs remain out of work, walking or sitting. No value at all for working in.\"",

John Hassard, co-founder of RVco, the firm developing the system, said it had planned to build the two megawatt station on the coast of Britain until the firm found out that it could take two years to get the go-ahead from up to 14 agencies. With the Icelanders, all it took was a phone call. \"One woman was in charge of planning permission, the environmental impact study, the national grid ... she said: 'Can we help you? We have money.'\" Two British wave power firms, Wavegen and Ocean Power Delivery, are also considering moving part of their research overseas because of lack of support at home. Dr Hassard, a scientist based at Imperial College where the technology behind RVco was invented, said that the government - fearful Britain would lose the tidal and wave power race as it lost out to Denmark over viable wind power - was now taking steps to help fledgling firms test their machines in home waters. It was unfortunate that this had not been done earlier. RVco's power stations will use a device called the Rochester Venturi, a cross between a wing and a funnel, which is placed underwater and channels tidal flows. As it passes through the device, the water decreases in pressure, sucking more water into pipes. This high pressure water drives on-shore turbines to generate electricity. The advantage of the system, invented by Dr Hassard's co-founder and Imperial colleague Geoff Rochester, is that unlike other wave and tidal devices it does not have any moving parts immersed in the sea. Because it is below the surface, it is not subject to storms. Dr Hassard said the price of electricity generated would ultimately be competitive with cheap gas power stations. If only the 10 best sites in the UK were used, venturis could generate one fifth of the electricity Britain uses each year. RVco is building a miniature version of its system near Grimsby, but only because a private owner made a stretch of riverbank available. Last month the energy minister, Peter Hain, admitted before a parliamentary committee that the government's ambitious targets for renewable energy - that it should make up 10% of Britain's electricity supply by the end of the decade - were in danger of getting bogged down in bureaucracy. He described planning de lays as \"a serious problem, both in the sheer bureaucracy and the associated costs that have to be waded through.\" In February the government announced it was considering a \"one stop shop\" for planning permission for offshore wind farms. But there has still been no decision on the long-awaited announcement of a dedicated stretch of coast to be set aside for companies to test wave and tidal power technologies. Dr Hassard said he hoped the government would designate a site on the Pentland Firth, the stormy sea strait between Orkney and the north coast of Scotland. Richard Yemm, of Ocean Power Delivery, a wave power firm based in Edinburgh, said it received regular offers from the Danes to install testbeds in their country. The firm was seriously considering an offer from a Dutch company to carry out joint tests in Portugal.",

      "body": "<p>While lecturers rarely receive any formal training as teachers, it is often expected that those applying for their first post will have had some teaching experience. This experience is usually secured by a period of postgraduate teaching.</p> <p>Generally, postgraduate teachers are PhD students who are invited by their department to run a number of undergraduate classes and mark assignments. This work is often viewed as casual employment. It is unusual for a postgraduate teacher to be recruited through formal advertisements, and they are paid on an hourly basis. While the majority of lectures in Britain's universities are still given by lecturers, postgraduates now carry out up to a half of all seminar teaching.</p> <p>And, as the number of postgraduate teachers continues to grow, so has the controversy surrounding their employment. Many complain that they are under-supported, underrepresented and underpaid. Nonetheless, postgraduate teaching remains an important step on the path to becoming a professional academic, and one that many PhD students value.</p> <p>Andy Charlwood, a postgraduate teacher at the London School of Economics, says that there are a number of benefits to becoming a postgraduate teacher. \"Having teaching experience does make it easier to get a job in academia. And if you teach an undergraduate course for your department, it gives you a broad overview of your subject. Also, it's a way of generating an income without having to do something completely separate to what you're studying.\"</p> <p>General secretary of the National Postgraduate Committee, James Groves, says that postgraduate teaching can be one of the most rewarding aspects of postgraduate study.

      "bodyText": "While lecturers rarely receive any formal training as teachers, it is often expected that those applying for their first post will have had some teaching experience. This experience is usually secured by a period of postgraduate teaching. Generally, postgraduate teachers are PhD students who are invited by their department to run a number of undergraduate classes and mark assignments. This work is often viewed as casual employment. It is unusual for a postgraduate teacher to be recruited through formal advertisements, and they are paid on an hourly basis. While the majority of lectures in Britain's universities are still given by lecturers, postgraduates now carry out up to a half of all seminar teaching. And, as the number of postgraduate teachers continues to grow, so has the controversy surrounding their employment. Many complain that they are under-supported, underrepresented and underpaid. Nonetheless, postgraduate teaching remains an important step on the path to becoming a professional academic, and one that many PhD students value. Andy Charlwood, a postgraduate teacher at the London School of Economics, says that there are a number of benefits to becoming a postgraduate teacher. \"Having teaching experience does make it easier to get a job in academia. And if you teach an undergraduate course for your department, it gives you a broad overview of your subject. Also, it's a way of generating an income without having to do something completely separate to what you're studying.\" General secretary of the National Postgraduate Committee, James Groves, says that postgraduate teaching can be one of the most rewarding aspects of postgraduate study. He says, \"I would encourage postgraduates to take up a teaching role if given the opportunity. There are problems surrounding contracts and pay, but they are getting better. It is important to stress, though, that it is important for them to realise how much work they are taking on. Because they are paid hourly, rates of pay often look quite generous, but when postgraduates look at all the hours they spend preparing and marking, they can very soon find themselves working for the minimum wage. \"It's important that students don't take on so much teaching that it effects their own academic work.\" Because so many postgraduates are keen to take on teaching, and others complain of poor working conditions, we have compiled a top ten list of the dos and don'ts of postgraduate teaching.

But we also need professionals whose contribution to the community is to assess and re-assess existing and new knowledge. Their work must be free of political and religious constraints. They must have the academic freedom that is the hallmark of our universities. Above all, they must exercise that freedom with responsibility. Therefore, the moral power of knowledge lies in people, not in books or machines.</p> <p>I would like to develop this theme by plotting the scientific career of Alex and examining the seven ages of a scientist.</p> <p><strong>Stage one: the infant</strong><br> Alex is born. What chances does he have of becoming a scientist? To begin with it depends where he is born. If Alex was born in the USA he would be 25 times more likely to get a first degree than if he was born in China. You can argue that this is an issue of education and opportunity in developing countries. But the point I want to make is that the economic reality is that we can afford to give Alex more opportunity to gain this knowledge, and become a scientist.</p> <p>But do we give all people an equal opportunity? Although more and more students are going to university, if Alex was born in the UK, into a family whose father was a senior civil servant, he would be eight times more likely to go into higher education than if his father was a refuse collector.</p> <p>What if Alex was a woman? Thankfully, in much of the developed world, an equal number of women and men are now studying for first degrees. Having said this, there are still gender inequalities in some subjects. In Ireland, as in the UK, the same proportion of women and men go on to higher education in the natural sciences but, in engineering, more than eight out of ten students are men. Why is this? Why don\u00d5t we have more women engineers? Is it because of the lack of role models, their schooling, or institutional discrimination?</p> <p>There are, of course, many other examples of social and gender inequalities that may inhibit, or increase, Alex\u00d5s early education. Although the causes of these inequalities are complex, it is a sobering thought that by accident of birth the success of Alex\u00d5s career is partly pre-determined.</p> <p><strong>Stage two: the schoolboy</strong><br> This brings us on to science education in schools. But first, some of the statistics on education amaze me.</p> <p>For example, nearly half of those born in Ireland in the 30's left education after primary school, compared with just over 7% of those born in the 60's. The number of people with scientific or technological qualifications doubled from about 80,000 in 1986 to almost 160,000 in 1996. As a result, Ireland now has by far the highest proportion of science and technology graduates, as a percentage of total employment, of all the OECD countries.</p> <p>This is a notable achievement and one that Ireland has every right to be proud of. It\u00d5s also clear that this is at least assisting - if not driving - the prolonged period of economic growth the country has experienced in recent years.</p> <p>Such facts point to the apparent success of yesteryear's science education. But I question this. When you look at the level of popular debate that we witness in the UK - on genetically modified foods, gene therapy, complementary medicine, and so on - it seems clear to me that science education was a failure for a very large number of people. It almost seems that some people became scientists, irrespective of their teachers. Yet teachers have a moral responsibility to give knowledge and understanding of their subject to all their students. If this is not done, then we can expect the sort of ill-informed debate that has typified much of the discussion on, for example, the use of genetics in healthcare. A debate often based on ignorance, prejudice and fear, a debate that has alienated and marginalised perhaps a majority of people, who have now become afraid of science. </p> <p>So what accounts for this failure? Some of the responsibility for this must surely lie within the universities. They train the teachers, who teach the pupils. They are, after all, the guardians of knowledge. Perhaps the way forwards is for us - the university, the academic, the scientist - to participate more in science education. When I was a working scientist, I went to the local primary school with two vials of blood - one the blood of a child with leukemia and the other without. I\u00d5d put them down on the table and start talking to the children about what they were made of - about cells, tissue and blood. They\u00d5d be listening to me - or at least I\u00d5d hope they were listening to me - and look at the blood. The blood was a lot more interesting than me: they could relate to it, it was part of them. The blood then began to settle, and it became obvious which vial was which and, in this way, the children began to understand what leukemia was and why it made people ill. They began to respect their own complexity. Some began to dream, I like to think, of becoming a scientist.</p> <p>Universities have to inspire tomorrow\u00d5s teachers. Inspired teachers inspire pupils, which in turn instills the motivation and desire for new knowledge. To do this, teachers need confidence in the subject matter and, in this context, I find it disturbing that there are more schools that teach physics than there are trained physicists coming out of the university system.</p> <p>I raise these points as only a few months ago the UK\u00d5s Council for Science and Technology published a report on science teachers. I was as surprised as the council was by one particular finding: the confidence of science teachers in their own subject was lower when teaching older classes, than when teaching the younger 11-13-year-old pupils. If teachers are not confident in what they teach, how can we expect pupils to have confidence in what they\u00d5re being taught? </p> <p>Despite all this, let\u00d5s assume that Alex beats the systems, gets a degree and still wants to become a scientist. To me he has become a lover.</p> <p><strong>Stage three: the lover</strong><br> The lover for me signifies the PhD student and that first post-doctoral job.</p> <p>Many of us my fellow professors have witnessed the endless hours of work, often in poor conditions for a disgraceful amount of money, that Alex would be expected to do if he embarks on a PhD. He will put up with this as he is in love. He loves the work. He loves the pursuit of knowledge. He loves the creativity that goes with his research. One could argue that Alex is blinded by that love.</p> <p>If Alex is blinded by that love, who is providing the vision? We are - and I wonder if our vision needs questioning? Are PhDs necessary? Maybe, with today\u00d5s technology driven science, PhDs are an outdated form of research training. How many PhD students should we be training? Maybe we should double stipends and halve the number of students.</p> <p>Europe leads North America and Asia in the number of science and technology doctoral degrees awarded. In 1995, science PhDs awarded by European institutions totalled 45,000, about 60% higher than in North America and almost three times as many as recorded for Asian countries.Yet North America is still the powerhouse for academic research. They produce 40% of scientific papers and are the inventors on 30% of patents.</p> <p>I don\u00d5t know what accounts for this difference in success, although I suspect that culture has a major role to play, but I do believe these issues need to be debated. To try and promote this debate the Wellcome Trust recently published two reports evaluating our PhD Research Training. From this survey, it\u00d5s clear that students embark on a PhD because they value independence, the open academic environment and the challenge. Yet this initial enthusiasm is often sadly, but quickly, tempered when reality strikes. One student said: \"The things that put me off are the career paths. If I was massively ambitious then I wouldn\u00d5t stay in the same lab, I\u00d5d be off to the States. Also the insecurity - there\u00d5s a lot of short-term contracts. If I ever wanted to start a family it doesn\u00d5t feel like it would fit within the whole thing\".</p> <p>Even so, some still remain in love. One student said: \"I have no desire to do anything else. I can\u00d5t believe someone pays you to do this.\"</p> <p>Let us assume that, like this last student, Alex completes his PhD and commences his first-post doc job. He\u00d5d be about 25 years old - probably carrying a large personal debt - and it\u00d5s taken 20 years of education to give him the knowledge that he\u00d5s going to require as a scientist. He is very much in the ascendancy of his chosen career. Alex has become a repository of existing knowledge, and is busy acquiring new knowledge. He has progressed from the pupil to the teacher to the policy maker. He has embarked on potentially the most satisfying but demanding part of his career. He has moved into the fourth age - that of the soldier.</p> <p><strong>Stage four: the soldier</strong><br> This age, to me, is the defining time in Alex\u00d5s career. Not least because he will have to face a number of issues and to reach a number of decisions.</p> <p>For our Wellcome Trust PhD students, there was a progressive decrease in the proportions who remained in academic research after graduating. Three years after completing a PhD, just under two thirds remained in academia, and by five years less than half remained in universities.</p> <p>We need to have a far better understanding of these career movements. Where are these people going? Are these highly trained scientists leaving science altogether? If many of the best young people leave our academic systems, who is going to train the next generation? As a society, we have a moral duty to ensure a constant influx of some of our best minds into the university system. People who will articulate complex ethical problems, consider the morality and power of new knowledge and assess its impact on society</p> <p>With these thoughts in mind we have to find ways of retaining some of our best young people in the university sector. Governments, here and in the UK, have to make some difficult decisions quickly. In the UK, for example, a recent independent report suggested that academic salaries need to be increased by as much as 20% to 30%, simply to get them to where they were 20 to 30 years ago. </p> <p>More astounding is the realisation that if Alex was a woman she would be earning - in the UK at least - on average, and at every level of the university system, 20% less than her male counterparts. In Ireland, a similar situation exists. Last year, an article in the Sunday Tribune reported a 20% earnings gap between men and women for the whole Irish workforce. </p> <p>One of the most unshakable memories of a trip I made to Ireland last year was the lack of female scientists. And those I did manage to meet were not happy. They had concerns about the amount of money they were paid. They were unhappy about the lack of family friendly employment practices. They were unhappy about the fact that only six out of every 100 professors in Ireland was a woman.</p> <p>Let\u00d5s not kid ourselves. This is due to institutional discrimination. And it\u00d5s not a problem exclusive to Ireland - the UK is similar. If universities are to compete with other sectors of employment, we have to offer a modern working environment. One that rewards staff, provides flexible working arrangements and, above all, provides everyone with an equal opportunity to succeed in their chosen career. </p> <p>But everyone has a role to play in valuing universities and in promoting academic careers . During the course of my life, I am sure that the esteem and standing of academics has declined, along with other professions such as nursing, teaching and even the clergy. Maybe society thinks these jobs are easy. Or that they\u00d5re not really necessary. How wrong they are - on all accounts.</p> <p>In short, Alex faces many hurdles as he soldiers his way through the forth age of a scientific career. If successful, he will become the leader of a lab - in Shakespearean parlance, the Justice.</p> <p><strong>Stage five: the Justice</strong><br> Alex is likely to be on the verge of becoming a professor. He has applied for numerous grants over the past five years and, on the whole, been quite successful. His publication output is near its peak. His role, as principal investigator on these grants, has been to motivate and train around five or six post-doctorate students, some of them themselves quite senior. He has, I expect, begun to realise that these post-docs are the ones who are actually pushing the frontiers of knowledge and are the real driving force of scientific discovery. To begin with he finds this insight difficult, but he soon understands that he in effect has become a manager - a manager of resources, people and ideas.</p> <p>And when you think about it, management training is a responsibility the university has sadly neglected. Yet, it is essential that we manage our most precious resource - people - and ensure that they, in turn, have the skills required to manage others.</p> <p>This issue has been explored by the Research Careers Initiative in the UK. They have found that although some universities have begun to provide some management training, individual academics are often reluctant to embark on such training programmes. We need to convince these people that they have a responsibility to manage their research staff and their students. Alex needs to realise that his own success is absolutely dependent on his success as a manager. His success in encouraging, inspiring and motivating his younger staff. His success in moving on to the sixth age.</p> <p><strong>Stage six: the slippered pantaloon</strong><br> Alex is now likely to become a Head of Department and, if successful, to go on and become a dean, a vice-chancellor or perhaps a chief scientific adviser. He is, undoubtedly, at the peak of his career.</p> <p>However, as he reaches that peak, he will have less and less time to do what he does best. Increasingly, he will have to deal with the administrative matters of his department, university and discipline. A recent survey on grant application behavior commissioned by the Trust shows that, in term time, about a third of Alex\u00d5s time would be taken up with administration and management, a third with teaching and a third with research. To emphasise an earlier point, it is notable that of the three activities predominating Alex's time, he has only received formal training for one - research.</p> <p><strong>Stage seven: second childishness</strong><br> Today, as we live longer and healthier lives, this period has become known as the third age. Academics, like the rest of society, are living longer and healthier but are, on the whole, retiring early. </p> <p>Or are they? In fact, it is not actually unusual for scientists to continue their academic work beyond retirement. Only last month, the Wellcome Trust awarded a project grant to Max Perutz, an 86-year-old past winner of the Nobel Prize, who will collaborate with Alan Ferscht at Cambridge University. They will determine the X-ray crystal structure of a protein implicated in a neuro-degenerative disorder called Mechedo-Joseph disease. Perhaps this is an example to us all.</p> <p>And that ends our passage through Alex\u00d5s career, from cradle to grave. Perhaps I have painted too negative a picture of academic careers as we begin the new millennium. I have, quite deliberately, pointed out a succession of hurdles that Alex will have to negotiate in his career. Some of these are entirely just - a successful career should be based on healthy competition with equality of opportunity.</p> <p>But we academics must remember, as we enter the new millennium, that just as Alex has to compete for research funds, for promotion, we have to compete with other careers. We have to persuade the youngest members of our society that an academic career is an attractive option, that being an academic, within our university system, can be rewarding, both intellectually and financially. By investing in people, we can ensure not only that knowledge is passed on from person to person, but we can be more confident that this knowledge can and will be used for the betterment of mankind - without prejudice, without fear, without ignorance. Only then will we see the real benefits of a knowledge based society. And only then will we really achieve the moral power of knowledge.</p>",

This is a notable achievement and one that Ireland has every right to be proud of. It\u00d5s also clear that this is at least assisting - if not driving - the prolonged period of economic growth the country has experienced in recent years. Such facts point to the apparent success of yesteryear's science education. But I question this. When you look at the level of popular debate that we witness in the UK - on genetically modified foods, gene therapy, complementary medicine, and so on - it seems clear to me that science education was a failure for a very large number of people. It almost seems that some people became scientists, irrespective of their teachers. Yet teachers have a moral responsibility to give knowledge and understanding of their subject to all their students. If this is not done, then we can expect the sort of ill-informed debate that has typified much of the discussion on, for example, the use of genetics in healthcare. A debate often based on ignorance, prejudice and fear, a debate that has alienated and marginalised perhaps a majority of people, who have now become afraid of science. So what accounts for this failure? Some of the responsibility for this must surely lie within the universities. They train the teachers, who teach the pupils. They are, after all, the guardians of knowledge. Perhaps the way forwards is for us - the university, the academic, the scientist - to participate more in science education. When I was a working scientist, I went to the local primary school with two vials of blood - one the blood of a child with leukemia and the other without. I\u00d5d put them down on the table and start talking to the children about what they were made of - about cells, tissue and blood. They\u00d5d be listening to me - or at least I\u00d5d hope they were listening to me - and look at the blood. The blood was a lot more interesting than me: they could relate to it, it was part of them. The blood then began to settle, and it became obvious which vial was which and, in this way, the children began to understand what leukemia was and why it made people ill. They began to respect their own complexity. Some began to dream, I like to think, of becoming a scientist. Universities have to inspire tomorrow\u00d5s teachers. Inspired teachers inspire pupils, which in turn instills the motivation and desire for new knowledge. To do this, teachers need confidence in the subject matter and, in this context, I find it disturbing that there are more schools that teach physics than there are trained physicists coming out of the university system. I raise these points as only a few months ago the UK\u00d5s Council for Science and Technology published a report on science teachers. I was as surprised as the council was by one particular finding: the confidence of science teachers in their own subject was lower when teaching older classes, than when teaching the younger 11-13-year-old pupils. If teachers are not confident in what they teach, how can we expect pupils to have confidence in what they\u00d5re being taught? Despite all this, let\u00d5s assume that Alex beats the systems, gets a degree and still wants to become a scientist. To me he has become a lover. Stage three: the lover The lover for me signifies the PhD student and that first post-doctoral job. Many of us my fellow professors have witnessed the endless hours of work, often in poor conditions for a disgraceful amount of money, that Alex would be expected to do if he embarks on a PhD. He will put up with this as he is in love. He loves the work. He loves the pursuit of knowledge. He loves the creativity that goes with his research. One could argue that Alex is blinded by that love. If Alex is blinded by that love, who is providing the vision? We are - and I wonder if our vision needs questioning? Are PhDs necessary? Maybe, with today\u00d5s technology driven science, PhDs are an outdated form of research training. How many PhD students should we be training? Maybe we should double stipends and halve the number of students. Europe leads North America and Asia in the number of science and technology doctoral degrees awarded. In 1995, science PhDs awarded by European institutions totalled 45,000, about 60% higher than in North America and almost three times as many as recorded for Asian countries.Yet North America is still the powerhouse for academic research. They produce 40% of scientific papers and are the inventors on 30% of patents. I don\u00d5t know what accounts for this difference in success, although I suspect that culture has a major role to play, but I do believe these issues need to be debated. To try and promote this debate the Wellcome Trust recently published two reports evaluating our PhD Research Training. From this survey, it\u00d5s clear that students embark on a PhD because they value independence, the open academic environment and the challenge. Yet this initial enthusiasm is often sadly, but quickly, tempered when reality strikes. One student said: \"The things that put me off are the career paths. If I was massively ambitious then I wouldn\u00d5t stay in the same lab, I\u00d5d be off to the States. Also the insecurity - there\u00d5s a lot of short-term contracts. If I ever wanted to start a family it doesn\u00d5t feel like it would fit within the whole thing\". Even so, some still remain in love. One student said: \"I have no desire to do anything else. I can\u00d5t believe someone pays you to do this.\" Let us assume that, like this last student, Alex completes his PhD and commences his first-post doc job. He\u00d5d be about 25 years old - probably carrying a large personal debt - and it\u00d5s taken 20 years of education to give him the knowledge that he\u00d5s going to require as a scientist. He is very much in the ascendancy of his chosen career. Alex has become a repository of existing knowledge, and is busy acquiring new knowledge. He has progressed from the pupil to the teacher to the policy maker. He has embarked on potentially the most satisfying but demanding part of his career. He has moved into the fourth age - that of the soldier. Stage four: the soldier This age, to me, is the defining time in Alex\u00d5s career. Not least because he will have to face a number of issues and to reach a number of decisions. For our Wellcome Trust PhD students, there was a progressive decrease in the proportions who remained in academic research after graduating. Three years after completing a PhD, just under two thirds remained in academia, and by five years less than half remained in universities. We need to have a far better understanding of these career movements. Where are these people going? Are these highly trained scientists leaving science altogether? If many of the best young people leave our academic systems, who is going to train the next generation? As a society, we have a moral duty to ensure a constant influx of some of our best minds into the university system. People who will articulate complex ethical problems, consider the morality and power of new knowledge and assess its impact on society With these thoughts in mind we have to find ways of retaining some of our best young people in the university sector. Governments, here and in the UK, have to make some difficult decisions quickly. In the UK, for example, a recent independent report suggested that academic salaries need to be increased by as much as 20% to 30%, simply to get them to where they were 20 to 30 years ago. More astounding is the realisation that if Alex was a woman she would be earning - in the UK at least - on average, and at every level of the university system, 20% less than her male counterparts. In Ireland, a similar situation exists. Last year, an article in the Sunday Tribune reported a 20% earnings gap between men and women for the whole Irish workforce. One of the most unshakable memories of a trip I made to Ireland last year was the lack of female scientists. And those I did manage to meet were not happy. They had concerns about the amount of money they were paid. They were unhappy about the lack of family friendly employment practices. They were unhappy about the fact that only six out of every 100 professors in Ireland was a woman. Let\u00d5s not kid ourselves. This is due to institutional discrimination. And it\u00d5s not a problem exclusive to Ireland - the UK is similar. If universities are to compete with other sectors of employment, we have to offer a modern working environment. One that rewards staff, provides flexible working arrangements and, above all, provides everyone with an equal opportunity to succeed in their chosen career. But everyone has a role to play in valuing universities and in promoting academic careers . During the course of my life, I am sure that the esteem and standing of academics has declined, along with other professions such as nursing, teaching and even the clergy. Maybe society thinks these jobs are easy. Or that they\u00d5re not really necessary. How wrong they are - on all accounts. In short, Alex faces many hurdles as he soldiers his way through the forth age of a scientific career. If successful, he will become the leader of a lab - in Shakespearean parlance, the Justice. Stage five: the Justice Alex is likely to be on the verge of becoming a professor. He has applied for numerous grants over the past five years and, on the whole, been quite successful. His publication output is near its peak. His role, as principal investigator on these grants, has been to motivate and train around five or six post-doctorate students, some of them themselves quite senior. He has, I expect, begun to realise that these post-docs are the ones who are actually pushing the frontiers of knowledge and are the real driving force of scientific discovery. To begin with he finds this insight difficult, but he soon understands that he in effect has become a manager - a manager of resources, people and ideas. And when you think about it, management training is a responsibility the university has sadly neglected. Yet, it is essential that we manage our most precious resource - people - and ensure that they, in turn, have the skills required to manage others. This issue has been explored by the Research Careers Initiative in the UK. They have found that although some universities have begun to provide some management training, individual academics are often reluctant to embark on such training programmes. We need to convince these people that they have a responsibility to manage their research staff and their students. Alex needs to realise that his own success is absolutely dependent on his success as a manager. His success in encouraging, inspiring and motivating his younger staff. His success in moving on to the sixth age. Stage six: the slippered pantaloon Alex is now likely to become a Head of Department and, if successful, to go on and become a dean, a vice-chancellor or perhaps a chief scientific adviser. He is, undoubtedly, at the peak of his career. However, as he reaches that peak, he will have less and less time to do what he does best. Increasingly, he will have to deal with the administrative matters of his department, university and discipline. A recent survey on grant application behavior commissioned by the Trust shows that, in term time, about a third of Alex\u00d5s time would be taken up with administration and management, a third with teaching and a third with research. To emphasise an earlier point, it is notable that of the three activities predominating Alex's time, he has only received formal training for one - research. Stage seven: second childishness Today, as we live longer and healthier lives, this period has become known as the third age. Academics, like the rest of society, are living longer and healthier but are, on the whole, retiring early. Or are they? In fact, it is not actually unusual for scientists to continue their academic work beyond retirement. Only last month, the Wellcome Trust awarded a project grant to Max Perutz, an 86-year-old past winner of the Nobel Prize, who will collaborate with Alan Ferscht at Cambridge University. They will determine the X-ray crystal structure of a protein implicated in a neuro-degenerative disorder called Mechedo-Joseph disease. Perhaps this is an example to us all. And that ends our passage through Alex\u00d5s career, from cradle to grave. Perhaps I have painted too negative a picture of academic careers as we begin the new millennium. I have, quite deliberately, pointed out a succession of hurdles that Alex will have to negotiate in his career. Some of these are entirely just - a successful career should be based on healthy competition with equality of opportunity. But we academics must remember, as we enter the new millennium, that just as Alex has to compete for research funds, for promotion, we have to compete with other careers. We have to persuade the youngest members of our society that an academic career is an attractive option, that being an academic, within our university system, can be rewarding, both intellectually and financially. By investing in people, we can ensure not only that knowledge is passed on from person to person, but we can be more confident that this knowledge can and will be used for the betterment of mankind - without prejudice, without fear, without ignorance. Only then will we see the real benefits of a knowledge based society. And only then will we really achieve the moral power of knowledge.",

HighTech Women managing director Lucy Marcus says a recent survey of members found that many were concerned about corporate social responsibility. \"The message came through loud and clear that they feel that 'doing good and doing well' is a powerful way to achieve balance, no matter where they are in their careers,\" says Ms Marcus. \"Their experiences with mentoring others and giving back to the community have been among the most satisfying and energising things they do.\" This ethos echoes government thinking. The Department of Trade and Industry is urging all areas of business to support literacy, numeracy and community investment projects as part of its corporate social responsibility programme. Suggestions for action include staff secondments, allowing local groups to share company facilities and acting as business brokers to attract project funding. IT start-ups are among the supporters of a national foundation designed to provide all British children over the age of four with a laptop by 2006. BenefisU, Bladerunner, Businesshr and Chalkscape have pledged donations to the fund, which will work with charities and schools to promote e-learning. It is funded by a \u00a35m government grant and \u00a31m from Microsoft. Bridging the digital divide is the focus of a new project by AOL UK. The company has teamed up with youth development charity Fairbridge to help disadvantaged young people to develop basic web design and IT skills. The aim is to improve their access to future education and job opportunities. AOL UK staff will work with young people to teach them about computers and the internet. Charlie Ward, project co-ordinator at Fairbridge, says the initiative will boost young people's skills and confidence. \"The majority have not had any previous access to computers or the internet,\" he says. \"This project will enable them to enter the information age on an equal footing with their peers.\" The IT sector lags behind other industries in the corporate giving stakes. Latest research by the Directory of Social Change shows IT companies contributed a mere \u00a33m to charities last year, compared to the \u00a360m given by the banking sector and \u00a321m from the oil and gas industries. One man on a mission to change this is Shaun Orpen, Microsoft director and newly appointed member of the NSPCC's corporate development board. His task is to encourage others in the IT sector to help raise \u00a35m for the charity's Full Stop campaign. Mr Orpen says IT companies are \"incredibly willing\" to share their time and skills with voluntary groups but have yet to fulfil this potential. \"I'd like to see the IT industry in the UK rise to this challenge,\" he adds.",

The station was determined to hold itself accountable, even to the point of ensuring that the complainant had the last say on the programme. It was a ground-breaking approach on many levels. ITV had no right to reply show and the BBC paid only lip service to the notion that licence payers opinions counted. Viewers who bothered to challenge the corporation were derided by patronising programmes such as Points of View, which was presented by Barry Took or Anne Robinson. The alternative was the great black hole that was the BBC's \"duty log\". For a while the corporation made an attempt to rival Right to Reply with its own version presented by Sue Lawley. Right to Reply, however, was different - it was half an hour long and given a key slot after the station's most popular show, Brookside. And in a first for a TV station, viewers were invited into the studios for a face-to-face discussion with programme-makers, with heavyweight TV names on hand to guard against intimidation. The first presenter was the Granada TV boss, Gus Macdonald, now Lord Macdonald. Other presenters included Linda Agran, Sheena McDonald, Brian Hayes, Rory McGrath and Roger Bolton. There was also the pioneering Right to Reply \"video box\" for those who couldn't make it to London, giving the programme a refreshing regional imprint. As one TV critic said, it gave viewers an opportunity to \"question and criticise the programmes that were transmitted and the smooth bastards who were responsible for making them\". And for the first time it gave viewers the opportunity to complain about programmes on any channel - something unheard of at the BBC. Tonight's show, which will includes a discussion on the BBC's Son of God documentary series, will be the last \"I think they should have changed the presenter or the format if they felt it was tired,\" said Mr Bolton, \"but doing away with it with no plans to replace it is a great shame. \"It is to their great credit that they have had the programme for so long, especially when the BBC so half-heartedly gave viewers a right to reply.\"",

Senior police officers have urged the Home Office to pursue initiatives similar to the anti-racketeering act in the US, which was credited with crushing the mafia . The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organisations Act (Rico) allowed federal agents to target the organising entity behind a crime, \"not merely the act\" itself. By concentrating on the conspiracy behind a crime, investigators were able to target mafia bosses as well as their footsoldiers. Sir David Phillips, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officer's policing committee, has supported the use of laws modelled on Rico in private advice to the Home Office, believing they could prove an essential crime-fighting tool. The Guardian has learned the Home Office is now circulating a classified consultation paper titled the Prosecution of Organised Criminal Conspiracy to gauge reaction to Rico- style laws from agenciessuch as customs and excise and the crown prosecution service, before deciding what to do. Concern in Whitehall that a premier league of criminals is prospering with impunity was bolstered last year with the findings of a confidential UK threat assessment report, compiled by the national criminal intelligence service (NCIS). An abridged version of the report was given to the media but the full document was only presented to ministers. An investigation into organised crime published in today's Economist newspaper claims to have uncovered further confidential details about the extent of criminality in the UK. The Economist says it has seen classified NCIS documents that refer to a group of 150 \"core nominals\" - intelligence-speak for crime bosses - and around 750 lieutenants who work for them. It says the number of such criminals increases by a third every year. NCIS yesterday denied that these figures were part of its confidential threat assessment report. Nevertheless, it has warned repeatedly about the increasing threat of organised crime in areas like drugs smuggling, illegal arms sales, and immigration rackets. The willingness of the Home Office to consider new powers for the police became apparent yesterday when it emerged that a leading criminologist, Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, was asked to prepare a paper on methods used by other countries to tackle organised crime. His report highlighted the effectiveness of Rico laws in the US, but also questioned whether such laws would work in the UK.

This is not just a reprise of crude Powellite race and miscenegation fears. It is not exactly race-hate. It is that old war cry for an England always in danger, always lost because it never was. Sir Richard's vision of English culture melds with his presidency of the Wodehouse Society and breeder of Gloucester Old Spots - the Empress of Blandings. His is an old English fantasy world, an imaginary heritage destroyed by modernism and outsiders.</p> <p>The Conservative party's racism resides not in their MPs' usually careful public words, nor in the maverick MPs who still blurt it out or print nasty leaflets at elections. It runs deeper, an old-fashioned racism ingrained in the aged sinews of that decaying party. Only visit the bar of Conservative clubs up and down the land to hear the unthinking racial suppositions so long banned from broadcasting and public discourse that it might wrongly be thought extinct. That casual, instinctive racism is a 1950s flashback, so uncool in an Ali G world where all the hip kids talk Brixton. But there it still is, perched on the bar stools at gatherings of small businessmen, poured out of silver pots at coffee mornings of Conservative Associations, the mind-set of that rump 30% that will be forever Tory. Maybe its cruder emanations are dying out in this party whose average age is 65 - yet you can still hear it in different tones among public school pupils as well as among the England football fans.</p> <p>At first William Hague set his mind against all such stuff in favour of modernism - that awkward coconut at the Notting Hill carnival was his better impulse. It only made his later return to party roots the more disappointing, but drowning politicians clutch at anything. However the reason runs deeper than that. Conservative core beliefs are rooted in an idea of Britishness or Englishness, that has race as a permanent leitmotif. The things Tories exist to conserve are a nationalist culture and history that declares Britain was and is always best. Such nationalism leads inevitably to spurious notions of ancient racial superiority, the Bull Dog Breed and all that. The anti-Europeanism which is the Tories' most sincere and passionate cause has old conservative racist origins.</p> <p>Yesterday, in a blistering speech, Robin Cook hit back at this poisoned view of British identity, rubbishing the \"myths of our island race\" as a \"pitiful misreading of British history\". The British, he said, are not a race but a gathering of countless races, most not indigenous to these islands. It was a well-written attack on a false British identity and a false vision of the future. His words chimed with the work of modern historians, Norman Davies' \"The Isles\" in particular, which dispels the Victorian and Edwardian fantasy history those over the age of 40 were reared on. History teaching was imbued with ideas of ancient racial superiority which offered a moral justification for the empire. Our Island Story and such nursery histories were stirring polemics, propaganda to shape a national identity out of an artificial racial notions. Just as the code word \"cosmopolitan\" used to cloak Tory fear of Jews, now \"multicultural\" represents to them the double threat of black and European influence. Foreigners have always been the enemy.</p> <p>Springing to William Hague's defence yesterday, Andrew Lansley, shadow cabinet office minister, said: \"When William was talking about the threat to Britishness and the sense of a foreign land, he wasn't talking about race, he wasn't talking about immigration or asylum. He was talking about policy in relation to Europe.\" And that is partly true: he was doing both. For the two are inextricably intertwined - a perpetual war to conserve the nation against outsiders.</p> <p>The coming referendum will be awash with fantasies about national identity - a modern versus an old vision of Britishness, a racial versus a multicultural view of identity. Two ideologies about who we are and where we are going will fight to the death. The pro-Europeans will shudder with horror at living isolated in a British nationalist, little Englander future. With equal repugnance, the Europhobes fear a multicultural pot melting down everything of value - Shakespeare, the bible, PG Wodehouse - in exchange for globalised pap, pan-European homogeneity stamping out our individuality. To them a European future does threaten the end of history as they always dreamt it.</p> <p>A few months ago the Runnymede Trust was ridiculed for a long and thoughtful report which dared to suggest that the very word British had racial connotations. Interestingly this same report also said - though it was barely reported in the furore - that Britain has the best race relations in Europe and Gurbux Singh of the Commission for Racial Equality agrees. Neo-nazis are not a significant force here. Quarter of a century of race relations laws have had a remarkably good effect. Thre is much still to do: Asians are still 16 times more likely to be victims of racial violence, Afro-Caribbeans and Asians are still three times more likely to be unemployed. But race is largely a no-go area in politics. Straw's unpleasant references to \"bogus\" asylum seekers and Hague's \"foreign land\" are small beer beside the rise of neo-nazis elsewhere - even in Sweden.</p> <p>This curious spasm of soul-searching about national identity needs to be laid to rest as soon as possible with the Euro-referendum. Defining national identity is a futile endeavour. Modern citizens have onion-like multiple identities, peeling back myriad skins depending on circumstance. The essence of conservatism is an instinct to tie things down, make borders, live within boundaries. Progressives have always been the far horizon internationalists.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;polly.toynbee@theguardian.com&quot;\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It only made his later return to party roots the more disappointing, but drowning politicians clutch at anything. However the reason runs deeper than that. Conservative core beliefs are rooted in an idea of Britishness or Englishness, that has race as a permanent leitmotif. The things Tories exist to conserve are a nationalist culture and history that declares Britain was and is always best. Such nationalism leads inevitably to spurious notions of ancient racial superiority, the Bull Dog Breed and all that. The anti-Europeanism which is the Tories' most sincere and passionate cause has old conservative racist origins. Yesterday, in a blistering speech, Robin Cook hit back at this poisoned view of British identity, rubbishing the \"myths of our island race\" as a \"pitiful misreading of British history\". The British, he said, are not a race but a gathering of countless races, most not indigenous to these islands. It was a well-written attack on a false British identity and a false vision of the future. His words chimed with the work of modern historians, Norman Davies' \"The Isles\" in particular, which dispels the Victorian and Edwardian fantasy history those over the age of 40 were reared on. History teaching was imbued with ideas of ancient racial superiority which offered a moral justification for the empire. Our Island Story and such nursery histories were stirring polemics, propaganda to shape a national identity out of an artificial racial notions. Just as the code word \"cosmopolitan\" used to cloak Tory fear of Jews, now \"multicultural\" represents to them the double threat of black and European influence. Foreigners have always been the enemy. Springing to William Hague's defence yesterday, Andrew Lansley, shadow cabinet office minister, said: \"When William was talking about the threat to Britishness and the sense of a foreign land, he wasn't talking about race, he wasn't talking about immigration or asylum. He was talking about policy in relation to Europe.\" And that is partly true: he was doing both. For the two are inextricably intertwined - a perpetual war to conserve the nation against outsiders. The coming referendum will be awash with fantasies about national identity - a modern versus an old vision of Britishness, a racial versus a multicultural view of identity. Two ideologies about who we are and where we are going will fight to the death. The pro-Europeans will shudder with horror at living isolated in a British nationalist, little Englander future. With equal repugnance, the Europhobes fear a multicultural pot melting down everything of value - Shakespeare, the bible, PG Wodehouse - in exchange for globalised pap, pan-European homogeneity stamping out our individuality. To them a European future does threaten the end of history as they always dreamt it. A few months ago the Runnymede Trust was ridiculed for a long and thoughtful report which dared to suggest that the very word British had racial connotations. Interestingly this same report also said - though it was barely reported in the furore - that Britain has the best race relations in Europe and Gurbux Singh of the Commission for Racial Equality agrees. Neo-nazis are not a significant force here. Quarter of a century of race relations laws have had a remarkably good effect. Thre is much still to do: Asians are still 16 times more likely to be victims of racial violence, Afro-Caribbeans and Asians are still three times more likely to be unemployed. But race is largely a no-go area in politics. Straw's unpleasant references to \"bogus\" asylum seekers and Hague's \"foreign land\" are small beer beside the rise of neo-nazis elsewhere - even in Sweden. This curious spasm of soul-searching about national identity needs to be laid to rest as soon as possible with the Euro-referendum. Defining national identity is a futile endeavour. Modern citizens have onion-like multiple identities, peeling back myriad skins depending on circumstance. The essence of conservatism is an instinct to tie things down, make borders, live within boundaries. Progressives have always been the far horizon internationalists. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, said this week that Tudjman, too, would have faced charges, probably arising from Zagreb's 1995 blitzkrieg campaign against the Serbs that won the war in Croatia and also resulting in the flight of scores of thousands of Serbs from their ancestral lands in Croatia. While both Serbian and Croatian leaders plotted the partition of Bosnia between them and drank whisky together as the forces under their control battled one another, the contrast between the two alleged war criminals is significant. Tudjman was an old-fashioned nationalist bigot, Milosevic a ruthless cynic who merely exploited nationalism and war to entrench himself in power for 13 years till he got his comeuppance last October and was finally arrested at the beginning of the month. The hunt for the evidence against the two Balkan strongmen provides graphic confirmation of their fears and phobias and of their confidence. One joke going the rounds in Belgrade has it that there is not even a copy of the Dayton agreement with Milosevic's signature on it to be found in the Serbian capital. The US-brokered agreement, signed in France in 1996, ended the Bosnia war. Milosevic, Tudjman, and Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, ceremonially signed off on it before the television cameras.

Documentation bearing the leader's autograph is frustratingly elusive. The investigators are hoping that close aides, some of them also in jail, will eventually cave in and turn compelling testimony against Milosevic. Things could not be different in Zagreb where the new government of Prime Minister Ivica Racan and President Stipe Mesic was astounded to find on entering office last year that Tudjman's legacy included a treasure trove of documents and recordings detailing every move the president made through the 1990s. A locked room at the presidential palace in Zagreb contained a wealth of damning material relating to the Tudjman regime's dirty tricks, embezzlement, profiteering, and political negotiations. Tudjman was so blissfully convinced of his own place in history, of his untouchability, and of his position as perpetual president that he clandestinely had almost every conversation in his office recorded from 1991 to 1999.

It aims \"to foster knowledge, understanding and prediction of the environment and its resources\". The council aims to: support high quality research and technology and maintain long-term capability to understand and predict the environment, natural resources and their response to change; foster the health and vitality of the UK environmental skills base through education,training and career development . It collects, manages and supplies environmental data and provides information to meet the needs of users and aims to provide objective, independent expert scientific advice and information to underpin national and international policy and sustainable development. It provides specialist scientific facilities and services to meet the needs of UK environmental sciences and works in partnership with users and other science suppliers to promote the effective transfer of knowledge. It also encourages public understanding of environmental issues and the role of science. </p> <p><strong>Background of the Science and Technology Board</strong><br> The introduction of the single Science and Technology Board (STB) has the following objectives:<br> \u0095 To promote much stronger multi- and inter-disciplinary earth system science within the NERC community, while retaining core activities.<br> \u0095 To involve NERC centres and surveys more closely in the development of NERC science strategy.<br> \u0095 To simplify and streamline the decision making processes, reducing the number of formal meetings and the number of small thematic programmes.<br> \u0095 To extend and enhance involvement of all sectors of the NERC constituency in the development of policy and provision of advice on science strategy. Greater involvement of younger scientists will be a key component.<br> \u0095 To clarify and simplify the reporting and assessment processes involved in the evaluation of existing science programmes.</p> <p>The new board will be under the supervision of the Director of Science Programmes via the new Board Secretariat that will also be responsible for both cross research council and cross disciplinary interests, such as climate change and polar issues. </p> <p>The heads of the four Science Teams are key figures in the new structure. They will continue to have management responsibilities but will put far greater emphasis on consultation and communication with the research community, government departments and agencies, industry, other users, and NGOs. Engagement will take many forms, ranging from the simple flow and exchange of information to involvement in time-limited task-focussed groups.</p> <p><strong>Budget breakdown</strong><br> The breakdown of the NERC budget for 1999/00 was as follows:</p> <p>Science budget income: Current expenditure \u00a3169.6m<br> Capital expenditure \u00a316.7m<br> External funding for research \u00a332.5m<br> Other income \u00a311.9m<br> Total income \u00a3230.7m</p> <p>In terms of people, NERC directly employs 2,608 staff across the UK in its research centres and in its Swindon headquarters. In 1999/00, 775 staff in higher education institutes were employed on NERC research grants. NERC also supported 68 research fellows, 1,058 PhD students and 334 Masters* students.</p> <p>NERC's science budget can be classified in two different ways:</p> <p>In terms of environmental and natural resource issues:</p> <p>Issue % science budget<br> Biodiversity 13%<br> Environmental risks and hazards 10%<br> Global change 28%<br> Natural resources 32%<br> Pollution amd waste 16%</p> <p>By scientific area:</p> <p>Science area % science budget<br> Atmospheric 4%<br> Earth 20%<br> Marine 26%<br> Terrestrial and freshwater 17%<br> Polar 26%<br> Earth observation 7%</p> <p>Their science budget is allocated through four different funding modes:</p> <p><strong>Thematic mode funding:</strong> Supports research in selected areas identified by NERC strategic planning and is 13% of the science budget.<br> <strong>Non-thematic mode funding:</strong> Supports curiosity driven research in areas identified by applicant and is 22% of the budget.<br> <strong>Core strategic funding:</strong> Supports strategic research of national importance and is 25% of the budget.<br> <strong>Infrastructure funding:</strong> Supports equipment, services and facilities for the NERC community, and is 39% of the total science budget.</p> <p><strong>Success rate</strong><br> In 1999/00, success rate (by number) in the non-thematic mode was 22% and in the thematic mode, success rate (by number) was 33%.</p> <p>The NERC supports basic research in all relevant disciplines, yet focuses directed research on areas where UK strengths and scientific opportunities coincide with priority environmental issues. </p> <p>The NERC works with other organisations including:<br> \u0095 The International Geosphere- Biosphere Programme<br> \u0095 The World Climate Research Programme<br> \u0095 The International Human Dimensions Programme<br> \u0095 The European Space Agency and the Ocean Drilling Programme. </p> <p>They are also actively involved in the European Union's Framework Programmes. </p> <p><strong>Top ten beneficiaries</strong><br> The top ten university beneficiaries of NERC support in 1999/00 were:<br> \u0095 Southampton University<br> \u0095 Cambridge University<br> \u0095 Imperial College<br> \u0095 Reading University<br> \u0095 Oxford University<br> \u0095 Edinburgh University<br> \u0095 Bristol University<br> \u0095 Leeds University<br> \u0095 Sheffield University<br> \u0095 University College London</p> <p><strong>Future issues and priorities</strong><br> Following the government's 2000 spending review, NERC will continue to support basic research in the environmental sciences and, in addition, will address certain priority areas including:<br> \u0095 Research using genomics to improve our understanding of ecology and evolution.<br> \u0095 Research in the area of \"e-science\". For example, the complexities of Earth's system mean that highly sophisticated computer models are needed to draw together the vast amounts of information on all aspects of the oceans, land, ice and the atmosphere.<br> \u0095 NERC will take the lead across all the research councils in developing a research agenda in the area of technology for sustainability and energy.<br> \u0095 NERC will launch a programme to study the behaviour of the coupled ocean - the atmosphere system of the north Atlantic - a system which keeps the UK 5-10 degrees warmer than would be expected for a country this far north.</p> <p><strong>Subject coverage</strong><br> Earth Observation<br> Earth Sciences<br> Freshwater Sciences<br> Marine and Atmospheric Sciences<br> Terrestrial Sciences</p> <p><strong>Grants</strong><br> <strong>Research CASE Studentships</strong><br> <strong>Funding:</strong> London - 8,570, elsewhere- 6,800.

It aims \"to foster knowledge, understanding and prediction of the environment and its resources\". The council aims to: support high quality research and technology and maintain long-term capability to understand and predict the environment, natural resources and their response to change; foster the health and vitality of the UK environmental skills base through education,training and career development . It collects, manages and supplies environmental data and provides information to meet the needs of users and aims to provide objective, independent expert scientific advice and information to underpin national and international policy and sustainable development. It provides specialist scientific facilities and services to meet the needs of UK environmental sciences and works in partnership with users and other science suppliers to promote the effective transfer of knowledge. It also encourages public understanding of environmental issues and the role of science. Background of the Science and Technology Board The introduction of the single Science and Technology Board (STB) has the following objectives: \u0095 To promote much stronger multi- and inter-disciplinary earth system science within the NERC community, while retaining core activities. \u0095 To involve NERC centres and surveys more closely in the development of NERC science strategy. \u0095 To simplify and streamline the decision making processes, reducing the number of formal meetings and the number of small thematic programmes. \u0095 To extend and enhance involvement of all sectors of the NERC constituency in the development of policy and provision of advice on science strategy. Greater involvement of younger scientists will be a key component. \u0095 To clarify and simplify the reporting and assessment processes involved in the evaluation of existing science programmes. The new board will be under the supervision of the Director of Science Programmes via the new Board Secretariat that will also be responsible for both cross research council and cross disciplinary interests, such as climate change and polar issues. The heads of the four Science Teams are key figures in the new structure. They will continue to have management responsibilities but will put far greater emphasis on consultation and communication with the research community, government departments and agencies, industry, other users, and NGOs. Engagement will take many forms, ranging from the simple flow and exchange of information to involvement in time-limited task-focussed groups. Budget breakdown The breakdown of the NERC budget for 1999/00 was as follows: Science budget income: Current expenditure \u00a3169.6m Capital expenditure \u00a316.7m External funding for research \u00a332.5m Other income \u00a311.9m Total income \u00a3230.7m In terms of people, NERC directly employs 2,608 staff across the UK in its research centres and in its Swindon headquarters. In 1999/00, 775 staff in higher education institutes were employed on NERC research grants. NERC also supported 68 research fellows, 1,058 PhD students and 334 Masters* students. NERC's science budget can be classified in two different ways: In terms of environmental and natural resource issues: Issue % science budget Biodiversity 13% Environmental risks and hazards 10% Global change 28% Natural resources 32% Pollution amd waste 16% By scientific area: Science area % science budget Atmospheric 4% Earth 20% Marine 26% Terrestrial and freshwater 17% Polar 26% Earth observation 7% Their science budget is allocated through four different funding modes: Thematic mode funding: Supports research in selected areas identified by NERC strategic planning and is 13% of the science budget. Non-thematic mode funding: Supports curiosity driven research in areas identified by applicant and is 22% of the budget. Core strategic funding: Supports strategic research of national importance and is 25% of the budget. Infrastructure funding: Supports equipment, services and facilities for the NERC community, and is 39% of the total science budget. Success rate In 1999/00, success rate (by number) in the non-thematic mode was 22% and in the thematic mode, success rate (by number) was 33%. The NERC supports basic research in all relevant disciplines, yet focuses directed research on areas where UK strengths and scientific opportunities coincide with priority environmental issues. The NERC works with other organisations including: \u0095 The International Geosphere- Biosphere Programme \u0095 The World Climate Research Programme \u0095 The International Human Dimensions Programme \u0095 The European Space Agency and the Ocean Drilling Programme. They are also actively involved in the European Union's Framework Programmes. Top ten beneficiaries The top ten university beneficiaries of NERC support in 1999/00 were: \u0095 Southampton University \u0095 Cambridge University \u0095 Imperial College \u0095 Reading University \u0095 Oxford University \u0095 Edinburgh University \u0095 Bristol University \u0095 Leeds University \u0095 Sheffield University \u0095 University College London Future issues and priorities Following the government's 2000 spending review, NERC will continue to support basic research in the environmental sciences and, in addition, will address certain priority areas including: \u0095 Research using genomics to improve our understanding of ecology and evolution. \u0095 Research in the area of \"e-science\". For example, the complexities of Earth's system mean that highly sophisticated computer models are needed to draw together the vast amounts of information on all aspects of the oceans, land, ice and the atmosphere. \u0095 NERC will take the lead across all the research councils in developing a research agenda in the area of technology for sustainability and energy. \u0095 NERC will launch a programme to study the behaviour of the coupled ocean - the atmosphere system of the north Atlantic - a system which keeps the UK 5-10 degrees warmer than would be expected for a country this far north.

Funding opportunities The NERC sponsor and carry out research through four different funding modes that achieve different objectives. Core Strategic funding, typically long-term, maintains expertise and knowledge in key areas of the environmental sciences, determined by the council. It supports relevant research, survey and monitoring, technology development, and the curation, interpretation and supply of environmental data. It meets current needs and forms a basis for meeting future priorities. Thematic funding contributes to development through basic, strategic and applied science, technology development and training, within selected themes. The council's strategic planning identifies these themes. Non-thematic funding supports curiosity-driven research, training and technology development in areas selected by applicants. Infrastructure funding provides support, equipment, services and facilities to the NERC community. More information on specific NERC Core Strategic and Infrastructure activities can be found on request from the NERC Planning and Communications Directorate: tel (01793) 411750, email: requests@nerc.ac.uk.

You always knew they were, and now they're out of the European Cup, even Roy Keane has admitted it.</p> <p>FMac has all you need to know about the Bayern games. \"Put bluntly,\" he writes, \"Bayern simply outclassed their opponents over both legs. It wasn't a case of Man U not playing up to standards ... they are just simply not good enough to dominate Europe.\"</p> <p>There are shortcomings in every department (even if you seem to think that Alex Ferguson has finally solved his goalkeeping problem) but the solution according to FMac is obvious: \"BUY PLAYERS!\" </p> <p>FMac highlights Andy Cole's deficiencies (\"At the Euro level the lad looks out of his depth he just is not clinical enough\") and Wes Brown and Mikael Silvestre's rawness. But MW of Cheshire knows where the true problem lies: \"They've only got one midfielder who knows how to tackle and cover properly - Roy Keane.\"</p> <p>This is, of course, a particular problem in European competition, where midfields tend to be more heavily populated. In most of their Champions League games this season, United have had only Keane and Paul Scholes in central midfield. In Munich, Ferguson brought in Nicky Butt, but the strength of the Jeremies-Effenberg-Scholl triumvirate proved conclusive.</p> <p>\"Both Bayern's goals were due to Paul Scholes's inability to track back and help his defence,\" MW claims. \"And David Beckham is no better - remember last year's tie against Real Madrid? How would signing Rivaldo solve this fundamental weakness?</p> <p>\"As for United's defence, if Coventry's Craig Bellamy and John Hartson can rip them apart, what hope do they have against the best in Europe? In fact Man Utd's whole team seems lacking in height, power and athleticism - which is especially noticeable in European games!</p> <p>\"When Real Madrid won last year's Champions League they immediately went out and bought Luis Figo. Similarly, Martin Edwards should have provided the funds to strengthen Fergie's team after their 1999 triumphs - whereas now United will have to strengthen on the back of failure and not success. It's a classic complacent mistake of empires in decline.\"</p> <p>Jez Mundy for one disagrees about the midfield. Ferguson, he says, \"possesses one of the very best midfield quartets in the world\" - but MW gets some support from David Coyle. \"Butt and Scholes in particular were overrun and failed to give adequate cover to their defence,\" he writes, \"while Ferguson has to take some tactical flack for the way in which he dealt with the absence of Beckham, which culminated in a void on that side of midfield. If only they had more players of the calibre of Roy Keane.\"</p> <p>David, however, sees more obvious shortcomings at full-back. \"It was glaringly obvious that Gary Neville and Silvestre are not good enough at this level. Neither defended adequately and their distribution came nowhere near to compensating for their failings at the back.\"</p> <p>Jez Mundy makes much the same point. \"Though Gary Neville excels at getting into threatening forward positions on the right he too often fails to clear the first defender with his cross,\" he writes. \"Similarly on the left Silvestre's distribution is far too hit and miss to carry any real threat.\"</p> <p>Jez is another who finds the strike force short of the highest standards: \"Yorke and Cole have none of the menace of an Elber or Jardel or a Hakan Sukur.\" FMac adds that \"in the Man U front line, Andy is not alone in the department of not creating or converting enough chances.\" And Richard Baxter asks: \"Is it just me or does anyone else find the Manchester United strikers lacking when put on the big stage?\"</p> <p>No, Richard. It's not just you.</p> <p>Naturally, most of you offer solutions. Keith Kelly of Limerick has the most forthright. \"United need to buy three players and sell two if they are to become a force in Europe. The side needs a defender, midfielder and striker, and the purchases have to be Van Nistlerooy up front, Rivaldo in midfield and ... Stephen Carr at full-back.</p> <p>\"Sign those three players and no one in the Premeriship will have a tinker's chance of catching United next season. The three may cost some amount of money, especially the Brazilian, so to recoup some funds sell the expired Dwight Yorke and ... David Beckham. The man is a genius at crossing the ball, but he can't defend, tackle or head the ball to save his life.\"</p> <p>The richest club in the world ought to be aiming to get the very best, of course, but Jez Mundy points out one possible limitation even to United's ambitions: \"Rivaldos and Zidanes probably don't do mock Tudor.\"</p> <p>And so on to Arsenal. Yeah, the so-called runners up. It turns out they're crap too.</p> <p>Robert Williams, an Arsenal supporter for 40 years and a Guardian reader for 35, fears that \"Arsenal seem to be intent on slipping away\".</p> <p>\"It's good to see that a consensus is growing about the striker problems at Arsenal. It is absolutely time that Bergkamp was sold - he hasn't produced since the double season. Wiltord is an expensive flop with a suspect attitude.

Kanu is absolutely not worth it now; the club's wrangles with Nigeria over his services should preclude him for being a part of the future with Arsenal.</p> <p>\"The sale of Petit was an absolute blunder by Wenger and his stated resistance to re-signing a player is almost worthy of ostrich-head-in-sand status.</p> <p>\"Since Petit left the midfield has not been able to give the necessary cover to the Arsenal defence which, let's be realistic, is not up to much these days.

Vieira can't protect the defence on his own - Ljungberg and Parlour can't be faulted for energy and enthusiasm going forward, but they leave the defence exposed. </p> <p>\"Which brings us to the back four. The left-back position is the only one secure - Silvinho and Cole are simply superb - but Dixon can only have a season left in him, and Luzhny is dependable at best. In central defence, we need to splash the cash. We desperately need an imperious but mobile central defender, a good reader of the ball comfortable bringing it forward - Nowotny anyone? And bring Upson back from loan and give him a run in the team - he has great potential.</p> <p>\"And we need a new keeper.\"</p> <p>Is that all? Ah, not quite. Mr Medialab alerts us to the success of Arsenal's multi-national youth set-up.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ankle socks began to creep into the picture about 10 years ago. Ankle socks, striped T-shirts and, of course, Hello Kitty. Previously, western conception of contemporary Japanese fashion tended to revolve around two very different looks: head-to-toe high fashion labels (notably Louis Vuitton) or the complex styles from the rigorously intellectual native designers, such as Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake, who insisted on elevating to an art form concepts such as the pleat. </p> <p>But something has changed. Japanese teenagers have been overturning the country's traditions, and foreigners' ideas of Japanese style, with their clothes, which run the gamut from super-kitsch (cartoon character T-shirts and pigtails) to super-cool (low-slung baggy trousers and patterned berets). In the past decade, they have become identifiable by what could be called extreme fashion: Hello Kitty T-shirts, bleached-out skirts, ankle socks with flip-flops. </p> <p>\"The Japanese have always been very good at assimilating outside influences and reinterpreting them,\" says writer and musician Matt Edwards, who spent last year studying in Japan. \"For example, one of Japan's three alphabets comes from the Chinese language, which the Japanese brought across and adapted to their own purposes. When Japan opened up to the west in the mid-19th century, it took on elements of western culture and modified them. Hello Kitty is a perfect example: it's like a reinterpreted Disney character. Japanese street fashion, though really varied, can basically be described as exaggerated western fashion.\" </p> <p>Now western fashion, in that cyclical movement that characterises fashion as a whole, is assimilating the look itself. Clements Ribeiro's poppy-print camisoles, Boyd's slogan T-shirts and Eley Kishimoto's technicolour floral print socks, dresses and coats already look set to be among summer's biggest fashion hits. </p> <p>This season's candy girl look, with sugar-sweet miniskirts, rainbow-splashed elasticated belts and, yes, ankle socks with teetering stilettos, all betray the influence of Japanese street fashion. For the whole of next month, the Selfridges stores in London and Manchester are turning themselves into Japanese superstores, stocking street labels, art and music never before available in Britain, as part of their Tokyo Life event. </p> <p>\"Japanese street fashion is like fashion liberation,\" says Anna King, a British freelance fashion writer who has lived in Tokyo for eight years. \"The bright colours, the reworked traditional patterns, the little bags - these teenagers have both a rebellious attitude to fashion and a fearless one. Their style is almost confrontational. You can't help but look at them.\" </p> <p>The contrast between what Japanese teenagers wear on the streets and what the more high-concept designers create in their studios is striking. On the one hand, we have a skirt with overlaid diagonal pleats and deconstructed stitching; on the other, we have a pink and yellow ankle sock. </p> <p>\"This duality is very representative of the country as a whole,\" says Susanne Tide-Frater, head of fashion direction at Selfridges. \"While Japan is a very futuristic country, it also still relies heavily on tradition. There is a real interest in role-play, too, and this is apparent in the streetwear.\" </p> <p>Edwards gives a more specific example. \"Japan's interest in role-playing tends to infantilise women, with its veneration of cute, small girls. This continues in the way Japanese teenagers dress today, with their pigtails and cartoon colours.\" </p> <p>More role-play is apparent among the teenagers' so-called \"style tribes\". Despite the apparent anarchy of Japanese street style, every element is strictly controlled and how a teenager dresses is determined by the \"tribe\" to which he or she belongs. Tribes such as last year's ganguro girls, with their tanned faces and platinum hair, or the ultra-kitsch Shibuya tribe, are generated and discarded at blink-and-you'll-miss-them speed. </p> <p>This Day-Glo, attention-grabbing look, so different from anything Japan had seen previously, emerged in part as a reaction to the country's recent economic instability - while high-status accessories remain extremely popular, there has been a return to designers of cheaper clothing. </p> <p>It can also be seen as a younger generation reaction to the sombre tone forced on their parents by the depression. \"All teenagers rebel,\" King says, \"and what better way to rebel against the solemnity of their parents than through happy-smiley, wear-and-be-damned clothing?\" </p> <p>After a decade of safe sportswear and demure neutrals, followed by last year's high-octane glitz, western consumers have embraced this more good-humoured approach to fashion. The high turnover of styles also attracts westerners tired of the way one trend, be it sportswear or retro 80s, infiltrates every collection, every store on the high street. The only reason Japanese style has taken so long to arrive in the west, Tide-Frater says, is that there have been practical problems exporting the clothes and adapting them to western sizes. </p> <p>\"Basically, Japanese street fashion is fun and this is what appeals to westerners,\" King says. \"When I go to the UK now and go through Hoxton Square or Shoreditch, I sometimes think I'm back in Tokyo.\"</p>",

Previously, western conception of contemporary Japanese fashion tended to revolve around two very different looks: head-to-toe high fashion labels (notably Louis Vuitton) or the complex styles from the rigorously intellectual native designers, such as Yohji Yamamoto and Issey Miyake, who insisted on elevating to an art form concepts such as the pleat. But something has changed. Japanese teenagers have been overturning the country's traditions, and foreigners' ideas of Japanese style, with their clothes, which run the gamut from super-kitsch (cartoon character T-shirts and pigtails) to super-cool (low-slung baggy trousers and patterned berets). In the past decade, they have become identifiable by what could be called extreme fashion: Hello Kitty T-shirts, bleached-out skirts, ankle socks with flip-flops. \"The Japanese have always been very good at assimilating outside influences and reinterpreting them,\" says writer and musician Matt Edwards, who spent last year studying in Japan. \"For example, one of Japan's three alphabets comes from the Chinese language, which the Japanese brought across and adapted to their own purposes. When Japan opened up to the west in the mid-19th century, it took on elements of western culture and modified them. Hello Kitty is a perfect example: it's like a reinterpreted Disney character. Japanese street fashion, though really varied, can basically be described as exaggerated western fashion.\" Now western fashion, in that cyclical movement that characterises fashion as a whole, is assimilating the look itself. Clements Ribeiro's poppy-print camisoles, Boyd's slogan T-shirts and Eley Kishimoto's technicolour floral print socks, dresses and coats already look set to be among summer's biggest fashion hits. This season's candy girl look, with sugar-sweet miniskirts, rainbow-splashed elasticated belts and, yes, ankle socks with teetering stilettos, all betray the influence of Japanese street fashion. For the whole of next month, the Selfridges stores in London and Manchester are turning themselves into Japanese superstores, stocking street labels, art and music never before available in Britain, as part of their Tokyo Life event. \"Japanese street fashion is like fashion liberation,\" says Anna King, a British freelance fashion writer who has lived in Tokyo for eight years. \"The bright colours, the reworked traditional patterns, the little bags - these teenagers have both a rebellious attitude to fashion and a fearless one. Their style is almost confrontational. You can't help but look at them.\" The contrast between what Japanese teenagers wear on the streets and what the more high-concept designers create in their studios is striking. On the one hand, we have a skirt with overlaid diagonal pleats and deconstructed stitching; on the other, we have a pink and yellow ankle sock. \"This duality is very representative of the country as a whole,\" says Susanne Tide-Frater, head of fashion direction at Selfridges. \"While Japan is a very futuristic country, it also still relies heavily on tradition. There is a real interest in role-play, too, and this is apparent in the streetwear.\" Edwards gives a more specific example. \"Japan's interest in role-playing tends to infantilise women, with its veneration of cute, small girls. This continues in the way Japanese teenagers dress today, with their pigtails and cartoon colours.\" More role-play is apparent among the teenagers' so-called \"style tribes\". Despite the apparent anarchy of Japanese street style, every element is strictly controlled and how a teenager dresses is determined by the \"tribe\" to which he or she belongs. Tribes such as last year's ganguro girls, with their tanned faces and platinum hair, or the ultra-kitsch Shibuya tribe, are generated and discarded at blink-and-you'll-miss-them speed. This Day-Glo, attention-grabbing look, so different from anything Japan had seen previously, emerged in part as a reaction to the country's recent economic instability - while high-status accessories remain extremely popular, there has been a return to designers of cheaper clothing. It can also be seen as a younger generation reaction to the sombre tone forced on their parents by the depression. \"All teenagers rebel,\" King says, \"and what better way to rebel against the solemnity of their parents than through happy-smiley, wear-and-be-damned clothing?\" After a decade of safe sportswear and demure neutrals, followed by last year's high-octane glitz, western consumers have embraced this more good-humoured approach to fashion. The high turnover of styles also attracts westerners tired of the way one trend, be it sportswear or retro 80s, infiltrates every collection, every store on the high street. The only reason Japanese style has taken so long to arrive in the west, Tide-Frater says, is that there have been practical problems exporting the clothes and adapting them to western sizes. \"Basically, Japanese street fashion is fun and this is what appeals to westerners,\" King says. \"When I go to the UK now and go through Hoxton Square or Shoreditch, I sometimes think I'm back in Tokyo.\"",

The war games come at a sensitive time, as US and Taiwanese officials are expected to finish their annual round of arms talks next week in Washington, and China continues to defy American requests for the return of the downed US spy plane. Taiwan hopes to purchase from the US four destroyers equipped with the missile-hunting Aegis radar system, diesel-electric submarines and an advanced Patriot anti-missile defence system. The proposed deal is a major source of friction in America's relations with China, because Beijing considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province that should not be purchasing weapons from other nations. Although the two sides have been governed separately since splitting amid civil war in 1949, China insists reunification must occur at some point and has said any declaration of independence by Taiwan would force a war. During the live-fire exercise on Taiwan's southern coast, Super Cobra attack helicopters and Tiger fighter jets swooped in on mock invading troops and fired rockets and bombs at targets in the sea. A Taiwanese military spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said that the drills were routine and planned far in advance, and that, despite the recent increase in tensions caused by the US spy plane crisis, there was no reason to cancel the exercises. \"We already discussed the drills with the Americans and they understand that the manoeuvres are routine and frequently conducted by all militaries,\" the spokesman said. Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, broke with tradition by not presiding over the war games.

      "bodyText": "The world's three biggest marketing groups have thrown their collective weight behind an internet-based media-buying tool. Interpublic, Omnicom and WPP plan to corner the market for planning and buying advertising space electronically. The yet-to-be named online advertising exchange will be headquartered in New York and will launch before the end of the year. Until now, electronic trading of advertising space has failed to ignite the market, but this development should lead to widespread take-up by planners and buyers. The move has been likened to the ongoing situation with Napster and the record industry in that the record companies have now joined forces to launch their own internet ventures after their revenues started to be threatened by online middlemen. Between them, Interpublic, Omnicom and WPP account for the lion's share of billings in the global advertising market, and boast some of the world's biggest agencies, such as Universal McCann, Lowe Lintas, Initiative Media, J. Walter Thompson, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, BBDO Worldwide, DDB Worldwide, and TBWA. The three partners are also calling on other marketing groups - such as Cordiant, Dentsu and Bcom3 - to join the venture. The venture also plans to provide buyers and sellers with the research data needed to plan media buys, so it is expected that it will be introduced as a company-wide tool on agency intranets. Omnicom chief executive John Wren said: \"We believe that technology presents a great opportunity to create a platform from which the billions of dollars now spent on media every week can be transacted much more effectively and cost-efficiently. \"We expect that the platform will both improve service and cost-efficiency to our clients and simultaneously benefit media sellers.\" Interpublic's Michael Lotito, previously president and chief operating officer of Initiative Media, will serve as the venture's chief executive officer. The development should send a warning shot through the number of online media exchanges that have emerged over the past few years. In the UK, these include the recently merged Optimad-iMediapoint, MediaTel's MediaTrader and Adazzle which has been working to develop strong ties with advertising groups. The problem with online ad exchanges at present is that planning and buying is, by and large, done on goodwill and often needs personal negotiation to clinch a deal. Another problem is that so far media owners have been loathe to wholeheartedly commit to these exchanges. Related story 12.02.2001: Online media buyers set to merge",

Guardian Unlimited revealed three weeks ago how Conservative MP John Townend - who hit the headlines over a speech criticising immigrants for undermining \"anglo-saxon culture\" - was the first politician to refuse to sign up for the pledge. He has since been joined by fellow Tory backbencher Eric Forth, and the Conservative whip James Cran in vetoing the commitment. However, Mr Portillo's refusal to put his name to the CRE promises to up the stakes considerably on an issue which is becoming a major battleground ahead of the coming general election.

The government, meanwhile, criticised the media for giving more prominence to this personality story, than to a substantive policy speech by Tony Blair.</p> <p>These are pretty much the battle lines across which all Labour's disputes with the press take place. The government is portrayed as being run by spin, and, with the departure of Charlie Whelan and Peter Mandelson, that criticism was falling ever more on Campbell's shoulders. The government portrays political journalists as the real spinners - shallow, self-obsessed creatures more concerned with lobby tittle-tattle than communicating important political events to their readers. Campbell's departure from battle lines, which I manned with him for four years, provides a timely opportunity to assess the state of the war.</p> <p>It is certainly true that Labour has given huge importance to media relations. Tony Blair is seared by the experience of campaigning against a highly effective Conservative communications team in the early 1980s and vowed early on in his leadership to build the most effective press team possible.</p> <p>It is also true that Labour was too slow to recognise that the communication style it had developed in opposition - informal, opportunistic and lightening fast - was ill-suited to government. In opposition, words were our only weapon and we tried to use every breaking political story to communicate our central messages and cause trouble for our opponents. In government, hasty reactions communicated through off-the record briefings can be extremely dangerous.</p> <p>We made mistakes. The trouble we caused ourselves by latching on to a story about director's pay at Camelot before the concrete policy implications had been thought through typified the differences between opposition and government communications. Briefing the Times on the Government's policy on the Euro, before Parliament had been told was a disaster, but also a turning point as Tony Blair made clear that such informality must end.</p> <p>However, it is no longer true to characterise the government as obsessed with spin. Policy-making does dominate press relations as it should. Tony Blair himself does not even read the newspapers, as he did, obsessively, in opposition. Alastair Campbell's briefings are normally more concerned with refuting stories in the press than placing them. Yet the charge against the government remains. 'Spin' has become part of a strategic attack by the Conservatives at a time when it is used less and less.</p> <p>What then of the government's claim that political journalists are dangerously obsessed with Westminster minutiae, of no interest to voters, and that they continually produce (in Campbellspeak) 'garbagic' stories? His frustration with Westminster journalists is genuine and well-founded. Perhaps the announcement of his departure will cause the Lobby to at least consider his criticisms of them.</p> <p>They should address the focus and quality of their output. Too often, factual reporting of events is replaced by an obsession with the process. The interaction with the journalist becomes the story rather than the medium of communication. This only happens in Westminster, and means that many political stories in the papers are pretty incomprehensible to anybody outside the House of Commons.</p> <p>And let's not beat around the bush here. Plenty of stories based around anonymous quotes are simply made up by lazy journalists, who know that nobody will ever be able to prove their invention. Of course most lobby journalists are not \"make-up merchants\" as Campbell calls them, but there are enough who are and their influence is corrosive. \"Isn't it funny that anonymous sources always speak in short sentences to the tabloids and in long sentences to the broadsheets\", Alastair used to remark dryly.</p> <p>Other times the source of the quote is dressed up to make it far more important than it is. I should know, my quotes to political journalists have often become quotes from 'a senior MP' or even on one occasion a 'senior Cabinet Minister' - quite an achievement considering I was a press officer for the Opposition at the time.</p> <p>This level of distortion cannot go on. With Whelan, Mandelson and Campbell all stepping down from the front lines, it is time to call a truce in the spin war. The government must ensure that its dealings with journalists are straightforward and honest. Lobby journalists must rescue their profession from the suspicions of invention which surround some of their work. After all, with so much news and information available instantly now, through TV and the internet, what the newspapers are selling is not news. It is credibility. They must not lose that.</p> <p><b>Tim Allan was a press spokesman for Tony Blair between 1992-98 </b><br> <b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/labour/0,9054,442879,00.html\">The Labour party</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/westminster/\">Westminster and Whitehall</a></p> <p><b>Related article</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/westminster/story/0,9134,472219,00.html\">12.04.2001: Campbell quits as PM's voice</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,339317,00.html\">Could you be a spin doctor?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.sexyalistair.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Alistair Campbell adoration site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.fnord.demon.co.uk/mt/second/campbell.html\" target=\"_new\">Mark Thomas Comedy Product - Campbell's past</a></p>",

Alastair Campbell's briefings are normally more concerned with refuting stories in the press than placing them. Yet the charge against the government remains. 'Spin' has become part of a strategic attack by the Conservatives at a time when it is used less and less. What then of the government's claim that political journalists are dangerously obsessed with Westminster minutiae, of no interest to voters, and that they continually produce (in Campbellspeak) 'garbagic' stories? His frustration with Westminster journalists is genuine and well-founded. Perhaps the announcement of his departure will cause the Lobby to at least consider his criticisms of them. They should address the focus and quality of their output. Too often, factual reporting of events is replaced by an obsession with the process. The interaction with the journalist becomes the story rather than the medium of communication. This only happens in Westminster, and means that many political stories in the papers are pretty incomprehensible to anybody outside the House of Commons. And let's not beat around the bush here. Plenty of stories based around anonymous quotes are simply made up by lazy journalists, who know that nobody will ever be able to prove their invention. Of course most lobby journalists are not \"make-up merchants\" as Campbell calls them, but there are enough who are and their influence is corrosive. \"Isn't it funny that anonymous sources always speak in short sentences to the tabloids and in long sentences to the broadsheets\", Alastair used to remark dryly. Other times the source of the quote is dressed up to make it far more important than it is. I should know, my quotes to political journalists have often become quotes from 'a senior MP' or even on one occasion a 'senior Cabinet Minister' - quite an achievement considering I was a press officer for the Opposition at the time. This level of distortion cannot go on. With Whelan, Mandelson and Campbell all stepping down from the front lines, it is time to call a truce in the spin war. The government must ensure that its dealings with journalists are straightforward and honest. Lobby journalists must rescue their profession from the suspicions of invention which surround some of their work. After all, with so much news and information available instantly now, through TV and the internet, what the newspapers are selling is not news. It is credibility. They must not lose that.

It is now 18 months since you started your research group, which is funded by two grants; one in which you piggy-backed onto the application of a well established senior figure in your department and another smaller grant which you obtained under a new lecturer scheme. Your honeymoon period of minimal teaching and administration is coming to an end and life is becoming very much more complicated, having to teach and contribute to the running of your institution as well as managing your own group. How are you going to become a successful academic juggling at least three different kinds of activities?</p> <p>Firstly, make sure that whatever you do you do it to the same high standard. You are going to have to budget your time carefully. Do not fall into the trap of seeing your research as your primary interest and teaching and administration as secondary. This will only result in your life becoming more difficult. Colleagues will resent your lack of commitment to areas they regard as primary and you will not be able to fully exploit the collegiate structure to do worthwhile research. </p> <p>You are also going to have to become fully independent and self sufficient. This means expanding your operation which means, in the short term, more funding problems. You are also going to have to learn to manage people - both within your group and others who provide central services, such as finance, personnel and local laboratory services. It is important that you have a considered coherent vision of how you will interact with people in your environment in order to behave consistently, productively and to avoid becoming stressed.</p> <p>Personal management styles differ dramatically between individuals. However, no matter how you do it, the most important thing for your own group is to set up a framework in which everybody knows what is expected of them, what their rights are and what to do if something goes wrong. There will inevitably be personal niggles, jealousies and competition for space and resources within the group, and it is your responsibility to spot these early and sort them out. You will need a mixture of both formal and informal approaches. Getting out of your office into the lab and simply talking to your group members is invaluable. You can obtain information in a much less threatening way than hauling somebody along to your office to obtain it. However, you do also need to have regular, well organised meetings with small sections of your group, and also whole group meetings to discuss day to day activities and problems, as well as the tactics and strategy of your research. Involvement builds loyalty and loyalty builds stability, which gives you the basis on which to do new work. </p> <p>Your future is very much bound up with the development of your group members, so lose no opportunities to help them acquire new skills, expertise and confidence in applying them. Give them the opportunity to present invited papers when you are too busy to do so or when you yourself are already giving a paper at the same meeting. Try to be as professional as possible in your dealings with your PhD students in particular. Remember that their entire future depends on achieving worthwhile results capable of being defended at a viva. They will be much better able to do this if they have been able to publish a couple of run of the mill papers, as well as a paper containing some first class research. Indeed, you should always maintain some pot-boiling work to enable you to satisfactorily complete end of grant reports, while at the same time continuing with a narrow strand of high class research. This will let you avoid embarrassment when things do not work out - and they often will not - and will help to maintain funding continuity. There is truth in the saying, \"publish or perish\", and even giants in the field need to stand on the shoulders of some dwarfs when that extra few centimetres is crucial. </p> <p>Remember to delegate. The total volume of work will grow as your group grows, but you do not need to dot every i or cross every t. Once you have established that you can trust somebody, then trust them. Let them do the whole job, check it once, and let them get it out of the door. </p> <p>Finally, the most important thing to remember when you are a group leader is why you got into it in the first place.

      "bodyText": "Scandal-hit Doncaster council is facing a fresh crisis after the arrest last night of its leader, Colin Wedd, in connection with allegations of expenses fraud. Mr Wedd is the third council leader at Doncaster to be arrested under Operation Danum, the long-running police investigation into corruption within the authority. South Yorkshire police said a man had been arrested in connection with the investigation into Doncaster council, for alleged offences of false accounting, and was given police bail until April 30. His arrest automatically triggers his suspension only days before Labour councillors were due to select a leader of the council in their annual vote. Mr Wedd was being challenged by councillor Gerry McLister, who cited the need for a clean break from the old Labour guard in the council chamber. Mr Wedd, 62, is the third leader of the authority to lose his position because of the \"Donnygate\" scandal. He took over the reins in 1998 following the arrest of previous incumbent Malcolm Glover, who had been trumpeted as the man to turn round the authority and put it on an even keel. Glover, 49, last year received a suspended jail sentence after admitting three charges of making false expenses claims. He had taken over from Peter Welsh, 47, who had stood down in 1997 following a report by the district auditor which revealed widespread junketing by members and officers. Mr Welsh was later charged with alleged expenses fraud, which he denies. He is due to appear in court next week. It is not known at this stage if Mr McLister will be given a clear run next week and installed as unopposed leader. Neither he nor Mr Wedd were today available for comment. Doncaster council chief executive David Marlow said: \"I have been made aware of the current situation by South Yorkshire police.

      "body": "<p>After eight weeks the foot and mouth epidemic is \"under control\" according to the government's chief scientist, David King, just in time for Tony Blair to call the election for June 7.</p> <p>The announcement was treated with jocular cynicism by the pack of reporters who have been covering the crisis and seen the news management of the crisis by Downing Street at close quarters.</p> <p>At the start of the outbreak all of the information that the government had was publicly available; once Tony Blair took charge specialist correspondents were denied the facts and daily lobby briefings were substituted.</p> <p>In this atmosphere rumour flourished, farmers who felt they were being kept in the dark got angry, and reporters turned on the hapless Ministry of Agriculture (Maff), which had been ordered by Downing Street to close down its website and news conferences.</p> <p>But Prof King's statistics were convincing. The number of outbreaks has dropped in line with predictions, if anything slightly faster, and if all continues in the same way Mr Blair will get his trouble-free election.</p> <p>Out in the shires some vets are not so sure. The problem all along has been that this strain of the disease has maverick properties that are hard to understand. While it is obvious if pigs and cattle have the disease, because of the symptoms and the suffering of the animals, sheep are a different matter.</p> <p>Although they do develop blisters in the mouth and sometimes have sore feet it is easy to miss altogether. If only a few sheep out of a large flock get the disease most farmers would not notice.

      "bodyText": "After eight weeks the foot and mouth epidemic is \"under control\" according to the government's chief scientist, David King, just in time for Tony Blair to call the election for June 7. The announcement was treated with jocular cynicism by the pack of reporters who have been covering the crisis and seen the news management of the crisis by Downing Street at close quarters. At the start of the outbreak all of the information that the government had was publicly available; once Tony Blair took charge specialist correspondents were denied the facts and daily lobby briefings were substituted. In this atmosphere rumour flourished, farmers who felt they were being kept in the dark got angry, and reporters turned on the hapless Ministry of Agriculture (Maff), which had been ordered by Downing Street to close down its website and news conferences. But Prof King's statistics were convincing. The number of outbreaks has dropped in line with predictions, if anything slightly faster, and if all continues in the same way Mr Blair will get his trouble-free election. Out in the shires some vets are not so sure. The problem all along has been that this strain of the disease has maverick properties that are hard to understand. While it is obvious if pigs and cattle have the disease, because of the symptoms and the suffering of the animals, sheep are a different matter. Although they do develop blisters in the mouth and sometimes have sore feet it is easy to miss altogether. If only a few sheep out of a large flock get the disease most farmers would not notice. Not until a second wave of infection, when large numbers of animals get the disease, is it notified. Often it is not until neighbouring herds of cattle get the disease that farmers realise their sheep have been infected all along. It is this, plus the fact that many valuable cattle have been part protected from the disease by being kept in sheds and are now being put out to pasture that makes the course of the disease less certain. Both factors could bring a new upsurge in cases. Prof King concedes that there may be a \"bumpy ride\" if all does not go according to plan. He may well be right.

      "byline": "Martin Kettle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Even in today's often emotionally sheltered world it comes as something of a shock to discover that the last public execution in the US took place as recently as 1937. Somehow, public executions seem to belong to a far more distant era - the Middle Ages, say, or the French Revolution - or, in more recent times, to self-evidently barbaric societies like Pol Pot's Cambodia.</p> <p>But one should never be surprised by America. And it is mark of what academics like to call this country's cultural \"exceptionalism\" that there is now a serious discussion going on here about what could be, to all intents, the first public execution to take place in the US since that last one in Missouri, 64 years ago.</p> <p>Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City mass murderer, is scheduled to die by lethal injection in a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, on May 16. Even before the question of who would get to see him die became the major talking point that it now is, the McVeigh case was already set to break records for all kinds of reasons.</p> <p>The execution will be the first federal, as distinct from state, execution since the return of the death penalty in the US in 1976. And because McVeigh committed the biggest single act of terrorism in US history - he killed 168 people in Oklahoma City in the bombing six years ago yesterday - he is arguably the worst killer in the nation's history, a grisly crown that McVeigh appears to wear with pride.</p> <p>As we near May 16, debate about the McVeigh execution will probably focus attention once again on the original and fundamental question of capital punishment itself. For now, though, the American public is distracted by a different aspect.</p> <p>The issue of the moment is whether McVeigh will become the first execution victim whose death will be shown on television. The question has arisen because of the convergence of two things: the sheer numbers of victims and the culture of emotional \"closure\".</p> <p>Because McVeigh murdered so many people, the pool of victims' relatives is unprecedentedly large too. They could not possibly all be accommodated in Terre Haute to watch his execution, should they all so wish.</p> <p>However, the victims' families also live in a society where individual closure, the perceived need to confront the emotions of victimhood or to complete the experience of bereavement, is accorded a reverence and a primacy that it was denied in the past.</p> <p>America is a land of many public rituals, and the public rituals of loss and pain are given a rein here that they would never be given in stiff upper-lip Britain, for example.</p> <p>Many of the victims' relatives have no desire to watch McVeigh die. But a lot of them do - in the sacred name of closure - and they are too numerous to be accommodated without closed circuit television.</p> <p>Last week, attorney general John Ashcroft authorised the relatives and survivors, who include rescue workers, to watch the May 16 execution on TV in Oklahoma City. Ashcroft's decision was a victory for the doctrine of retribution, which the attorney general strongly supports, and also for the modern cult of victimhood, which most of his fellow conservatives despise.</p> <p>If he thinks that he has drawn a line, Ashcroft is wrong. If McVeigh's execution can be seen by some Americans, why not by others? This week, a federal judge turned down a request from a group called the Entertainment Network, which wanted the right to show the killer's death on the internet.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the legal challenge for the right to see McVeigh die - which McVeigh, eager to project himself as a martyr, supports - is not over.

      "bodyText": "Even in today's often emotionally sheltered world it comes as something of a shock to discover that the last public execution in the US took place as recently as 1937. Somehow, public executions seem to belong to a far more distant era - the Middle Ages, say, or the French Revolution - or, in more recent times, to self-evidently barbaric societies like Pol Pot's Cambodia. But one should never be surprised by America. And it is mark of what academics like to call this country's cultural \"exceptionalism\" that there is now a serious discussion going on here about what could be, to all intents, the first public execution to take place in the US since that last one in Missouri, 64 years ago. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City mass murderer, is scheduled to die by lethal injection in a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, on May 16. Even before the question of who would get to see him die became the major talking point that it now is, the McVeigh case was already set to break records for all kinds of reasons. The execution will be the first federal, as distinct from state, execution since the return of the death penalty in the US in 1976. And because McVeigh committed the biggest single act of terrorism in US history - he killed 168 people in Oklahoma City in the bombing six years ago yesterday - he is arguably the worst killer in the nation's history, a grisly crown that McVeigh appears to wear with pride. As we near May 16, debate about the McVeigh execution will probably focus attention once again on the original and fundamental question of capital punishment itself. For now, though, the American public is distracted by a different aspect. The issue of the moment is whether McVeigh will become the first execution victim whose death will be shown on television. The question has arisen because of the convergence of two things: the sheer numbers of victims and the culture of emotional \"closure\". Because McVeigh murdered so many people, the pool of victims' relatives is unprecedentedly large too. They could not possibly all be accommodated in Terre Haute to watch his execution, should they all so wish. However, the victims' families also live in a society where individual closure, the perceived need to confront the emotions of victimhood or to complete the experience of bereavement, is accorded a reverence and a primacy that it was denied in the past. America is a land of many public rituals, and the public rituals of loss and pain are given a rein here that they would never be given in stiff upper-lip Britain, for example. Many of the victims' relatives have no desire to watch McVeigh die. But a lot of them do - in the sacred name of closure - and they are too numerous to be accommodated without closed circuit television. Last week, attorney general John Ashcroft authorised the relatives and survivors, who include rescue workers, to watch the May 16 execution on TV in Oklahoma City. Ashcroft's decision was a victory for the doctrine of retribution, which the attorney general strongly supports, and also for the modern cult of victimhood, which most of his fellow conservatives despise. If he thinks that he has drawn a line, Ashcroft is wrong. If McVeigh's execution can be seen by some Americans, why not by others? This week, a federal judge turned down a request from a group called the Entertainment Network, which wanted the right to show the killer's death on the internet. Nevertheless, the legal challenge for the right to see McVeigh die - which McVeigh, eager to project himself as a martyr, supports - is not over. Other efforts will be made to widen the audience. And it remains a possibility that film of the execution may somehow find its way into the public domain anyway. Which means that, if one execution is made public, what can then prevent others from being broadcast? Yesterday afternoon, I watched the televised launch of the latest Space Shuttle from Cape Canaveral. A glorious event that was once unthinkable has now become almost routine television. Twenty years from now, though, Americans may be able to turn on, tune in and watch the latest execution on the box with just as much ease.

Here political correspondent Matthew Tempest profiles Blair's first 11 of Labour's brightest female prospects. Goalkeeper Patricia Hewitt: They say goalies get better with age, and at 48 Patricia Hewitt has certainly got a safe pair of hands, both as Neil Kinnock's right-hand woman when Tony Blair was barely getting his feet under the desk as a new MP, and most importantly as one of the early architects of New Labour. Now e-commerce minister, a promotion to the Cabinet for this highly-able performer seems a sure bet. Ask Aristotle about Patricia Hewitt Right back Rosie Winterton: As a member of Labour's national policy forum, this Yorkshire MP and former adviser to John Prescott will have helped shape the next manifesto. Yet to stamp her authority on any policy specialism, but an interest in buses, bypasses and cowboy wheel clampers could see her patching up Labour's achilles heel of transport in any Blair second term. Ask Aristotle about Ann Winterton Left back Lorna Fitzsimons: This mouthy former leader of the national union of students has a style which fits uncomfortably at Westminster, but should see her playing a significant role during the election campaign trying to get the \"youth vote\" out for Labour. If that succeeds, the strongly pro-European Fitzsimons could be called on again for the Euro referendum hustings in two years time. Ask Aristotle about Lorna Fitzsimons Centre half Gisela Stuart: Ms Stuart was thrust into the limelight when she became the first Labour MP to win a marginal seat on election night. Since then she has been lauded as one of Labour's potential stars, especially following her good work as a junior minister at the department of health. While in parliament she has successfully campaigned for kerbcrawling to be made an arrestable offence. Ask Aristotle about Gisela Stuart Centre half Sally Keeble: Supremely intelligent and calm presence on the backbenches, Keeble is a rising star of the future, if not for this time around. A former journalist, it will be interesting to see what questions she poses for Nick Brown over the handling of foot and mouth in her role on the agriculture select committee. Ask Aristotle about Sally Keeble Right wing Yvette Cooper: The granddaughter of a miner, who went to Oxford, smoked dope, and came out with a first-class degree in PPE, is now one of Labour's brightest stars. As undersecretary of state for public health she has shone - despite a reprimand from Sir John Krebs of the Food Standards Agency after she revealed information without his permission. Her marriage to Ed Balls, the chancellor's chief adviser, ensures that Ms Cooper benefits from the support of Gordon Brown as she rises to the top. Ask Aristotle about Yvette Cooper Left wing Ruth Kelly: This industrious former journalist is the brains behind much of the government's thinking of family-friendly working practices and welfare benefits for single mothers. Having given birth to three children herself since winning her seat in 1997, she is certainly qualified to lead the putsch of working mothers into ministerial, or even Cabinet, level politics. Ask Aristotle about Ruth Kelly Central midfielder Tessa Jowell: Has been waiting in the wings since 1992, but recent behind the scenes lobbying for Tony Blair and Jack Straw to concede that marriage is not the only role model for society, and another big push for equal pay has seen her stock rise among progressive backbenchers from the 1997 intake. Mocked over her scheme for a \"fat summit\" and idea of monitoring TV for images of female anorexia, her articulacy, charm and pure capacity for work (usually 75 hours a week) should see her promoted after a second election victory. Ask Aristotle about Tessa Jowell Central midfielder Clare Ward: The youngest female in MP in the House, was seen as a leadership stooge until she recently added to the chorus of criticism of Europe minister Keith Vaz following an internal Labour investigation into his constituency. Keen to synchronize voting rights with other legal responsibilities at one age, be it 16 or 18, she still has a long way to go, but at 28, she has the time to do it. Ask Aristotle about Claire Ward Striker Harriet Harman: Thick-skinned enough to pick up the pieces after her brutal sacking in Tony Blair's first reshuffle, Harman has recently put herself back in the running to rejoin the Cabinet with a strong serious of proposals on how to reconnect women voters with the Labour movement. Ask Aristotle about Harriet Harman Striker Oona King: It's not her fault that she's young, female, black, jewish and good looking, but on the grey-suited benches of the Commons chamber it certainly hasn't done her any harm. An ultra-Blairite loyalist, who escaped on a fact-finding mission to Bangladesh to avoid voting for a cut in single mothers, she is well-versed in urban renewal, the new deal, international development and third world debt. With a high media profile, Labour would be silly not to use her talents during a second term. As a former aide to Glenys Kinnock in Brussels, Keith Vaz's job as Europe minister could be on the horizon. Ask Aristotle about Oona King The coach Anji Hunter: With a friendship stretching back to the age of 15, Ms Hunter is the gatekeeper of Downing Street and one of Mr Blair's closest confidantes. If Blair has a message to get across, or needs a sounding board, she is the woman he most trusts. Ms Hunter looks set to become Mr Blair's political secretary after the next election.

      "bodyText": "The 'untouchables' used to be the nickname given to police squads tackling organised crime in America. Now, the term applies to the criminals themselves. According to security sources, between 150 and 200 crime bosses are operating in the UK. Their numbers are growing and the police are finding it impossible to get anywhere near them. These super-criminals are too far up the chain of command, too shielded by lieutenants and foot soldiers. It has emerged today that the country's most senior officers, including Sir David Phillips, the chief constable of Kent, have urged the Home Office to consider giving them sweeping new powers, similar to the anti-racketeering laws passed in America 30 years ago which were credited with smashing mafia families in New York, Boston and Chicago. But though the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organisations Act (Rico) gave federal agents giddying authority - allowing investigators to concentrate on the conspiracy behind the crime, rather than the crime itself - there are two good reasons to think similar laws would not work here. First, the UK does not have the equivalent of the tightly knit Italian/American mafia families which, over generations, had burrowed their way into unions controlling industries like rubbish collection and construction. Rico laws allowed investigators to seize control of public bodies suspected of being infected with mafia influence, and replace the management. Such powers wouldn't be much use in the UK. We don't have the levels of organised, systematic corruption in similar spheres. Secondly, Rico gave the FBI the right to use evidence gathered by phone tapping in court. This went to the heart of being able to prove conspiracy between the men who were issuing the orders, and the underlings who followed them. In this country, such material is inadmissible as evidence. The police use wire-tapping to gather \"intelligence\" on suspects, but that's all. Recently, the Home Office, after consultation with the police, decided to keep the status quo. Detectives told ministers they didn't want the techniques they use for gathering such material being described in court, giving criminals another potential advantage. For the laws to work, police officers would have to change their mind. Without phone-tapping evidence, Rico is a tiger without any teeth.

I am of course referring to the hairy godfather of punk rock who recently died of cancer, Joey Ramone.</p> <p>What? Has another Conservative candidate flipped his lid? Before you metaphorically cart me off to the funny farm let me explain why the lead singer of The Ramones holds the key to success for the Tories in this phoney election period.</p> <p>I am not suggesting that the party's law and order stance should be toughened along the lines of the lyric much quoted in obituaries this week: \"Beat on the brat, beat on the brat, beat on the brat with a baseball bat.\" Neither am I proposing that the only response to the current state of the opinion polls is to be found in the Ramones' memorable track \"I wanna be sedated.\" Nor am I suggesting compulsory shoulder length hair and leather jackets for members of the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>The genius of the Ramones was that their songs, like Rockaway Beach or Sheena is a Punk Rocker, were incredibly short and almost unbelievably repetitive. Verses were out, perpetual choruses were in. In most tracks three chords were seen as unnecessary; two would do. Once you could hum one tune (if tune is the right word, which it isn't), you could hum them all.</p> <p>Similarly, the secret of effective political communication is to find the right tune and then repeat it endlessly until the message is driven home.

      "bodyText": "There is an iconic figure from the 1970s and 80s that should inspire the Conservative party this week. I am of course referring to the hairy godfather of punk rock who recently died of cancer, Joey Ramone. What? Has another Conservative candidate flipped his lid? Before you metaphorically cart me off to the funny farm let me explain why the lead singer of The Ramones holds the key to success for the Tories in this phoney election period. I am not suggesting that the party's law and order stance should be toughened along the lines of the lyric much quoted in obituaries this week: \"Beat on the brat, beat on the brat, beat on the brat with a baseball bat.\" Neither am I proposing that the only response to the current state of the opinion polls is to be found in the Ramones' memorable track \"I wanna be sedated.\" Nor am I suggesting compulsory shoulder length hair and leather jackets for members of the shadow cabinet. The genius of the Ramones was that their songs, like Rockaway Beach or Sheena is a Punk Rocker, were incredibly short and almost unbelievably repetitive. Verses were out, perpetual choruses were in. In most tracks three chords were seen as unnecessary; two would do. Once you could hum one tune (if tune is the right word, which it isn't), you could hum them all. Similarly, the secret of effective political communication is to find the right tune and then repeat it endlessly until the message is driven home. I once worked for a cabinet minister who used to reject press releases because, as he put it: \"I've said all this before.\" Eventually he agreed to persevere. It was only when he came back from one event and said that people had started repeating his own message back to him that I said it was almost time to move on to something new. The Conservatives have more than enough messages for a Ramone-style, election-winning album. There is no need for William Hague to finish all his campaign speeches with Joey's meaningless wind up to (virtually) every Ramones song \"gabba, gabba hey\", but I am yet to find a voter in Witney who dissents from the two chord riff: \"Your taxes are up but public services have got worse.\" Some commentators complain that the Conservatives have not developed enough detailed policies.

It showed that in Cumbria, where at one point 200,000 carcasses were awaiting disposal, that figure is now closer to 10,000.</p> <p>Similarly, the number of animals awaiting slaughter in the county - being visited today by the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon - once at 89,000, is now close to zero.</p> <p>In Scotland and the north-east there is no discernible disposal backlog; while in Worcestershire it is said to be small and reducing. In Wales, the disposal backlog has fallen from 30,000 to around 4,000, and the slaughter backlog down to 10,000 from 90,000.</p> <p>The disposal backlog in Devon, however, remains significant.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman noted that there is \"no room for complacency\" and added: \"We will continue to bear down totally on the disease in our determination to contain and eradicate it.\"</p> <p>The announcement came against the backdrop of encouraging news on progress in combating the disease. The government's chief scientist yesterday declared the epidemic was now \"fully under control\".</p> <p>David King said the policy of mass culling infected animals as well as healthy livestock had been successful, that the countryside had seen a significant drop in the daily number of outbreaks, an average of 27 by last Sunday compared with 43 a fortnight previously.</p> <p>In addition, Maff confirmed late last night that Northamptonshire and Leicestershire had became the first parts of the country to shed their \"infected area\" status. The announcement releases more than 1,000 farms from infected area restrictions.</p> <p>The question of vaccination, however, still remains. Prof King has refused to rule out a vaccination programme in the worst affected areas. But the National Farmers' Union president, Ben Gill, yesterday reiterated his opposition to vaccination.</p> <p>Mr Gill said he had written to his union's local offices explaining why the leadership did not think vaccination was desirable. \"Remember, once you start vaccinating, you can't say 'let's stop and go back to where we were'. You are committed. Animals have been exposed to the vaccine and hence the consequent problems,\" he said.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,474590,00.html\">Explained: vaccination</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">Explained: the spread of foot and mouth</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475723,00.html\">20.04.2001: The jab of conscience</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> </p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475847,00.html\">20.04.2001: Royals boost tourism industry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475867,00.html\">20.04.2001: Organic farmers criticise NFU over vaccination</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475661,00.html\">20.04.01: Foot and mouth fully under control, says scientist</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475682,00.html\">20.04.01: Restrictions to be lifted</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475508,00.html\">20.04.01: Hill farmers 'need to be land stewards'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475515,00.html\">20.04.01: Ministry quietly eases mass slaughter policy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475524,00.html\">20.04.01: Organic farm sees off Maff over cull plan</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\">16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br> <b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "Downing Street today revealed new statistics suggesting that the backlogs of animals awaiting slaughter, and of slaughtered animals awaiting disposal, are significantly smaller than previously reported. An enhanced reporting effort was being made to ensure that the figures more accurately and promptly reflect the intensified slaughter and disposal programme. It showed that in Cumbria, where at one point 200,000 carcasses were awaiting disposal, that figure is now closer to 10,000. Similarly, the number of animals awaiting slaughter in the county - being visited today by the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon - once at 89,000, is now close to zero. In Scotland and the north-east there is no discernible disposal backlog; while in Worcestershire it is said to be small and reducing. In Wales, the disposal backlog has fallen from 30,000 to around 4,000, and the slaughter backlog down to 10,000 from 90,000. The disposal backlog in Devon, however, remains significant. A Downing Street spokesman noted that there is \"no room for complacency\" and added: \"We will continue to bear down totally on the disease in our determination to contain and eradicate it.\" The announcement came against the backdrop of encouraging news on progress in combating the disease. The government's chief scientist yesterday declared the epidemic was now \"fully under control\". David King said the policy of mass culling infected animals as well as healthy livestock had been successful, that the countryside had seen a significant drop in the daily number of outbreaks, an average of 27 by last Sunday compared with 43 a fortnight previously. In addition, Maff confirmed late last night that Northamptonshire and Leicestershire had became the first parts of the country to shed their \"infected area\" status. The announcement releases more than 1,000 farms from infected area restrictions. The question of vaccination, however, still remains. Prof King has refused to rule out a vaccination programme in the worst affected areas. But the National Farmers' Union president, Ben Gill, yesterday reiterated his opposition to vaccination. Mr Gill said he had written to his union's local offices explaining why the leadership did not think vaccination was desirable. \"Remember, once you start vaccinating, you can't say 'let's stop and go back to where we were'. You are committed. Animals have been exposed to the vaccine and hence the consequent problems,\" he said. Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up What's going on?

      "body": "<p><strong> In the Mood for Love</strong><br> Retail (\u00a315.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99)<br> Tartan Cert PG **** <br> </p> <p>Hong Kong's great stylist Wong Kar-Wai only seems to make films about love affairs, yet each is as distinctive as it is memorable. This subtle, elusive piece about a couple drawn together when they realise their partners are having an affair has more in common with Brief Encounter than his cheeky, inventive Chungking Express or his delirious, lurid Fallen Angels. It leaves much of its story unsaid and unseen, leaving you to concentrate on its central couple, a relationship that might have flowered in another time and another place. It's languid, full of quiet, still moments, and impeccably played by Tony Leung (also in Wong's last film, Happy Together) and Maggie Cheung. Where Chungking Express was full of youthful high spirits and the Mamas and Papas' harmonies, this is a film of middle-aged regrets with a haunting score by Michael Galasso making a perfect fit.

      "bodyText": "In the Mood for Love Retail (\u00a315.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99) Tartan Cert PG **** Hong Kong's great stylist Wong Kar-Wai only seems to make films about love affairs, yet each is as distinctive as it is memorable. This subtle, elusive piece about a couple drawn together when they realise their partners are having an affair has more in common with Brief Encounter than his cheeky, inventive Chungking Express or his delirious, lurid Fallen Angels. It leaves much of its story unsaid and unseen, leaving you to concentrate on its central couple, a relationship that might have flowered in another time and another place. It's languid, full of quiet, still moments, and impeccably played by Tony Leung (also in Wong's last film, Happy Together) and Maggie Cheung. Where Chungking Express was full of youthful high spirits and the Mamas and Papas' harmonies, this is a film of middle-aged regrets with a haunting score by Michael Galasso making a perfect fit. It's about stilted conversations, lost opportunities and possibilities drifting away like the smoke from Leung's countless cigarettes. Wong, the director, producer and writer, ended the film \"physically and financially exhausted\" but he won two awards at Cannes. Can't wait for his next, a foray into sci-fi.

Though he had already recycled much of the music of Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno in the operas Agrippina and Rinaldo, he revised and extended it as Il Trionfo del Tempo e della Verita in London in the 1730s, and then at the very end of his life, in 1757, made an English version of it as The Triumph of Time and Truth. It was clearly a work he cherished: what had been consciously written to show off his talents on his arrival in Italy is crammed with virtuoso writing and extrovert effects. Rinaldo Alessandrini conducts that original version, and certainly conveys all its youthful exuberance. The opening Sinfonia, with its crisply articulated string playing, sets the tone for everything that follows, and both the choral and the solo singing maintain the same incisive brilliance, with the soprano Deborah York and the mezzo Sara Mingardo particularly outstanding. </p> <p><strong> Verdi: Requiem</strong><br> Fleming/Borodina/Bocelli/ D'Arcangelo/Kirov Chorus &amp; Orchestra/Gergiev<br> (Philips, 2 CDs) ** <br> \u00a321.99<br> </p> <p> There is much to admire about this new recording, but it is fatally flawed. It boasts two outstanding soloists in Ren\u00e9e Fleming and Olga Borodina - both on their most lustrous form, turning their every contribution into an emotionally charged statement - as well as the Kirov Chorus and Orchestra responding vividly to Valery Gergiev's typically supercharged leadership. But the choice of Andrea Bocelli as the tenor is a shameful piece of commercial opportunism that calls into question the artistic credibility of the whole undertaking. Tonally and musically he is quite out of his depth, and from his first appearance in the opening Kyrie, his sour, strained tone and clumsy phrasing are totally destructive of the poise and coherence of the whole work. It is, sadly, not that much of a surprise that a serious record company should have tried to boost sales in such a way, but it is a shock that a conductor of Gergiev's stature and integrity should have gone along with it. </p> <p><strong> Britten: Peter Grimes</strong><br> Pears/Watson/Pease/Kelly/ Brannigan/ROH Chorus &amp; Orchestra/Britten<br> (Decca, 2 CDs) ****<br> \u00a313.99<br></p> <p> For many, Benjamin Britten's 1958 recording of his opera, with Peter Pears in the role that was created for him, is definitive. There is distinguished competition, however, and both Richard Hickox's version for Chandos, with Philip Langridge as Grimes, and Colin Davis's for Philips, with the incomparable Jon Vickers, reveal facets of the work ignored in the composer's own reading. Yet Britten's performance is still hard to resist: he articulates all the orchestral detail with exemplary care, and besides Pears, the the cast - especially Claire Watson's Ellen Orford, James Pease's Balstrode, and Owen Brannigan's Swallow - is first-rate. The remastering is vivid: almost too clear, when previously undetectable studio noise intrudes. </p> <p><strong> Tavener: Total Eclipse; Agraphon</strong><br> Rozario/Harle/Robson/ Gilchrist/New College, Oxford Choir/Academy of Ancient Music/Goodwin<br> (Harmonia Mundi) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br></p> <p> Total Eclipse, first performed last June, is John Tavener's second work to use a period-instrument orchestra, which here is pitted against the splenetic soprano saxophone of John Harle and the far more evocative solo voices of countertenor of Christopher Robson and tenor James Gilchrist, with New College Choir. They sing a text from the gospels compiled by Tavener's regular collaborator Mother Thekla, which describes St Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus. It is music that makes great use of spatial effects and, according to the composer, should be performed in a \"petrified ecstasy\". In this work and in Agraphon, a 1995 setting for the soprano Patricia Rozario of a modern Greek devotional text, Tavener's admirers will no doubt find the mixture of becalmed contemplation and assertive grandeur as potent as the rest of us find it banal. </p> <p><strong> Elgar: String Quartet; Piano Quintet</strong><br> Brown/Sorrel Quartet <br>(Chandos) ***<br> \u00a314.99<br></p> <p> The String Quartet and the Piano Quintet make a natural coupling, both composed towards the end of the first world war when Elgar retreated from London to the Sussex countryside to concentrate upon chamber music. The Brahmsian Quintet is the more direct and expansive piece, the Quartet the more personal and elusive, with the forms of its three moments drastically compressed. The Sorrel Quartet sound more at ease when partnering the pianist Ian Brown in the Quintet, and their performance is by turns affectionate and bold. In the quartet, though, they never quite get to grips with the terseness of the argument, nor find the ideal balance between maintaining the music's onward flow of invention and allowing its phrases the space to make their expressive point.</p>",

There are no world-music diversions, passages of electronic impressionism, DJs, or classical special effects here - but there are vistas of musical space. </p> <p>The strength of the original pieces sags a little half-way down the playlist, when a jaunty jazz-rhumba, a piece of Hudson-at-dawn flute impressionism and a rattly Latin feature put the thematic distinctiveness on hold. But two-thirds of the record is intelligent, co-operative and expressive contemporary jazz. </p> <p>The set is bookended by two accounts of the waywardly graceful, Ornette Coleman-like theme of the album title - two accounts because guitarist Stryker, caught in New York traffic, missed the first take. Slagle cuts into the piece with his funky swing and alternately quacky and deep-thoated tone, and Jackson is a compelling splice of the fizzy energy of Billy Higgins and the bumpy, offbeat relaxation of the late Ed Blackwell. </p> <p>The same sense of easy freedom is caught by Loftology, the first free-wheeling exchange between Slagle's alto and Joe Lovano's tenor. The second, Thelonious, features some chorus-swapping between the two saxophonists that makes you leap out of your chair. Between them comes a piece of sleazy, bottleneck-guitar bluesiness that could have easily fitted on a Bill Frisell or John Scofield disc. </p> <p>Slagle plays soprano sax once, like a whoopier Wayne Shorter, on the initially fragmentary and then gently swinging St Mark's Shuffle: he harmonises spine-tinglingly with Stryker's clangy guitar chords. All in all, this is unpretentiously exhilarating music.</p>",

The strength of the original pieces sags a little half-way down the playlist, when a jaunty jazz-rhumba, a piece of Hudson-at-dawn flute impressionism and a rattly Latin feature put the thematic distinctiveness on hold. But two-thirds of the record is intelligent, co-operative and expressive contemporary jazz. The set is bookended by two accounts of the waywardly graceful, Ornette Coleman-like theme of the album title - two accounts because guitarist Stryker, caught in New York traffic, missed the first take. Slagle cuts into the piece with his funky swing and alternately quacky and deep-thoated tone, and Jackson is a compelling splice of the fizzy energy of Billy Higgins and the bumpy, offbeat relaxation of the late Ed Blackwell. The same sense of easy freedom is caught by Loftology, the first free-wheeling exchange between Slagle's alto and Joe Lovano's tenor. The second, Thelonious, features some chorus-swapping between the two saxophonists that makes you leap out of your chair. Between them comes a piece of sleazy, bottleneck-guitar bluesiness that could have easily fitted on a Bill Frisell or John Scofield disc. Slagle plays soprano sax once, like a whoopier Wayne Shorter, on the initially fragmentary and then gently swinging St Mark's Shuffle: he harmonises spine-tinglingly with Stryker's clangy guitar chords. All in all, this is unpretentiously exhilarating music.",

Responsibility has preoccupied Potter here, and almost all the pieces are devoted to one or other of his musical heroes. </p> <p>As if he were overwhelmed by their example, there are fewer instances than you might expect of Potter's remarkable ability to pack more melodic invention and tonal variety into a short sax solo than many of his contemporaries can manage all night. Also, the themes themselves are substantially slighter than Potter's spontaneous ideas, which wouldn't matter so much if they were not given quite so much lingering attention. The opener is a Coltraneish blues with a theme suggestive of a McCoy Tyner track - but though this and its two successors (a slow shuffle for Joe Henderson and a bright and funky piece echoing the 1970s Keith Jarrett American band dedicated to Sonny Rollins) draw good solos from Potter, he sounds as if he's playing well inside his usual vaulting resources. </p> <p>It isn't until the baleful, stalking theme, with its lurking bass clarinet undertow in tribute to Eddie Harris, that more of an urge enters the proceedings.

But whereas Mat Maneri has frequently explored electronics on his father's often exhilaratingly rich and subtle works, ECM boss Manfred Eicher asked him to stay with acoustic violin and viola here.

      "body": "<p>Ruby Short-Staffed at the Gene Pool <br>(Wichita) *** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> Despite favourable critical reaction to 1995's Salt Peter, her first album as Ruby, Lesley Rankine never lived up to the next-cool-thing status briefly conferred on her in the mid-1990s. Every ounce as bilious as sister Scot Shirley Manson, she lacks Manson's pop proclivities, so while the latter sells millions with Garbage, Rankine's trip-hoppy mutterings reach a more select audience. Short-Staffed at the Gene Pool has taken six years to materialise, during which Rankine lived in New Orleans and Seattle, adding new, mainly beats-based sounds to her portfolio. At the same time, her vocals acquired a feline sinuousness, though the feline is a tiger rather than a pussycat, claws unsheathed even at seductive moments. She titles a song Roses for the malevolent delight of whispering \"I don't smell like roses\", and another Sweet Is so that she can perversely claim \"Sweet is the wind that brings tragedy\". If Dido's too wet, try this. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Isaac Hayes </strong> The Man! The Ultimate Isaac Hayes 1967-1977<br> (Stax) ***** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Isaac Hayes's stock has plummeted of late, following a lacklustre mid-1990s comeback, scientology dabblings and South Park. However, from his solo debut in 1968 to his bankruptcy in 1977 with $6m of unsettled debts, he reinvented black music. For all his potential preposterousness, Hayes was a three-dimensional figure: his men openly ached. Today, rappers cover the bones of a song and build a new tale around it, but Hayes was there first. He wrestles with Walk On By for 12 minutes, while his extraordinary version of By the Time I Get to Phoenix takes 19 dignified minutes to reach its destination. Moreover, before the song itself kicks in, Hayes has narrated a harrowing back- story, recasting the saga in the ghetto. He could also up the tempo: Theme from Shaft is as taut and funky as it was nearly 30 years ago, while his finest moment was Ike's Mood 1, a symphonic instrumental which, by its climax, carries echoes of Ennio Morricone's Battle of Algiers - set, inevitably, in the ghetto. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Janet Jackson </strong> All for You<br> (Virgin) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Despite giving every outward appearance of being uninterested in her musical career, Janet has been the most popular Jackson for a decade. She has been lucky, for while she receives a co-writing credit on all tracks, she is essentially the plaything of producers and co-songwriters Terry Lewis and Jimmy \"Jam\" Harris III. When they are on their game, creating absorbing backgrounds - on the exhilarating Trust a Try and the feisty duet with Carly Simon, Son of a Gun - then Jackson sounds as if she is the disco queen. Alas, for the most part here, Jam and Lewis tread water, resulting in a succession of lazy, anodyne ballads such as Truth and Better Days, which leave Jackson's underpowered voice overexposed. The nadir, however, is the embarrassing Would You Mind, where Jackson attempts sexy. \"I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you,\" she claims, with laughable libidinousness. Tragically, her squeaky serenade is skin-crawlingly akin to being seduced by a member of Minipops. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Serge Gainsbourg </strong> I Love Serge: Gainsbourg Electronica <br>(Mercury) **** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> Ten years after his death, Serge Gainsbourg's reputation continues to precede him. Outside France, he remains better known as a lecherous old goat than a songwriter; when his songs are discussed, attention focuses on words before music. Unsurprising given Gainsbourg's lyrical preoccupation with farting and underage sex, but a shame: Gainsbourg took risks, experimenting freely with African rhythms, reggae and disco. Air and Portishead have revered his 1971 album Histoire de Melody Nelson, a fusion of tremulous orchestration and rhythmic punch. Sadly, neither grace this remix collection, and their absence is felt throughout Howie B's flat reworking of Ballade de Melody Nelson. Elsewhere, Gainsbourg's breathy growl is the perfect companion to an array of beats. Bob Sinclar remixes Marabout into joyful house and the Orb's Requiem Pour un Con surrounds slinky beats with a pervasive aura of sleaze. Gainsbourg, who once attempted to popularise a dance in which men jigged around clutching their partner's breasts, would undoubtedly approve. (AP) </p> <p><strong> Firstborn </strong> When It Hits You, Feel No Pain<br> (Independiente) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Twenty-five years after its heyday, northern soul still reverberates through British music. You hear its echoes in the tinny euphoria former northern DJ Pete Waterman constructs for Steps and the rolling pianos behind Belle and Sebastian's bedsit melancholy. Its influence continues, unaffected by fashion, because northern soul has anachronism in-built: even during its mid-1970s peak, the scene's biggest records were 10 years old, relics of a Motown-influenced sound replaced by disco, yet still worshipped in England's north-west. Accordingly, northern soul has transcended its American origins and become shorthand for a particularly British, working-class combination of perseverance and escapism. Its slogan? \"Keep the faith.\" None of this is lost on Dublin producer Oisin Lunny, whose debut album fuses northern soul samples and pounding techno to create a grim picture of urban nightlife. But if Lunny understands northern soul's romantic image, the music's uplifting spirit has bypassed him: he unearths northern soul heroine Mary Love, then reworks her life-affirming Lay this Burden Down as a turgid dirge. Worse, Irish author Bennan Murphy rants, swears and humourlessly intones Bob Dylan lyrics throughout the album. Keeping the faith never sounded such hard work. (AP) </p> <p><strong> Lil Bow Wow </strong> Beware of Dog <br>(Columbia) *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Hip-hop's canine obsession continues apace with Lil Bow Wow, born Bryan-Michael Cox 13 years ago in Columbus, Ohio. Discovered by Snoop \"Doggy\" Dogg when, aged 6, he made his stage debut on Dr Dre's Chronic tour, he is already a phenomenon in the US, with a slew of hits in the rap charts and a platinum album to his name. Beware of Dog features Snoop, LL Cool J and Da Brat, but it was the involvement of Jermaine Dupri (the writer/producer behind novelty early-1990s kid-rap duo Kriss Kross) that ensured its success. The material is profanity-free - on the Timbaland-ish Puppy Love, LBW is a PG-rated playa, while This Playboy conflates G-Funk smoothie Warren G's This DJ and nursery rhyme This Old Man - but everything else, from the boy's fast-and-loose delivery to his relentless self-promotion, is for adults only. (PL) </p> <p><strong> Dion </strong> Born to Be With You / Streetheart (Ace) **** <br> \u00a312.99<br> </p> <p> By 1975, even his most ardent admirers had more or less given up on Phil Spector. But then, out of the blue, he came up with two singles as extraordinary as anything he had made during his golden era. Inevitably, in a world preparing itself for the arrival of punk, both sank without trace. The first was Darlene Love's incandescent Lord, If You're a Woman; the second was Dion's Make the Woman Love Me, a masterpiece of introspection. For the occasion, Spector reassembled the Wrecking Crew - the session musicians responsible for his original Wall of Sound - and applied them to a song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, the composers of You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin'. Almost all the characteristic ingredients are present: the floating haze of acoustic guitars, the thick carpet of low-pitched horns, the filmy choral mist and, front and centre, the implacable backbeat. Only the strings are missing - in deference, surely, to Dion DiMucci, whose sinewy voice was bred on the streets of the Bronx. His highly wrought performance reminded listeners of what a wonderful singer Dion had always been, from A Teenager in Love through Runaround Sue to his superlative version of Ruby Baby in the mid-1960s. A second single, a version of the Chordettes' 1956 hit Born to Be With You, lent its title to the subsequent album and also attracted a cult following, although it is less spectacular than Make the Woman Love Me. Now reissued by Ace in tandem with Streetheart, a perfectly listenable slice of high-gloss Hollywood rock produced by Steve Barry and Michael O'Martian the following year, it offers a chance to hear the last significant flowering of an authentic pop genius. (RW) </p> <p><strong> Marcos Valle</strong> Escape <br>(Far Out Recordings) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> These are tough times for Brazilian music, as Cuba's domination of the Latin scene continues. This new set by one of the key figures in the 1960s bossa-nova movement is, for the most part, merely a reminder of past glories. The production work may be exquisite (thanks to the likes of 4Hero) but take away the cool, squeaky funk effects and Valle's own classy guitar and keyboard solos, and this is still music for the Girl from Ipanema in the chill-out lounge. Most of the songs are pleasant and immaculately performed, with the expected careful balance of light, rapid percussion and jazz-funk instrumental work with laid-back vocals, both from Valle and Patricia Alvi, but they lack any real sense of surprise or innovation. Even less interesting are the soporific instrumental tracks, such as the inappropriately titled Poweride. But there is one track here that shows there could be new life in Valle's bossa nova yet. Festeira shows off his slick and funky acoustic guitar work at its best, with help from some gently impressive percussion playing. It isn't the promised \"total reincarnation of bossa nova\", but it's one step in the right direction. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Richard Hawley </strong> Richard Hawley <br>(Setanta) *** <br> </p> <p> Sheffield guitarist Richard Hawley has had a chequered career, plying his fretwork for All Saints, Pulp, Finlay Quaye and Perry Farrell while labouring for longer in his own bands Treebound Story and the Longpigs. None of these roads should lead to a sepia-tinged collection of 1950s-influenced ballads. However, with a haunting croon, a tremelo bar and an echo chamber the size of the Mersey tunnel, his first solo album effortlessly conjures up the days when all rockers were called Buddy, Gene or Eddie, and songs were listened to while perfecting a curl of the upper lip. Hawley's songs are so eerie you can almost smell the hair grease, yet strangely timeless: the religious awe of Coming Home is as much Spiritualised as Gene Vincent. As Elvis and Roy Orbison would testify, never underestimate the appeal of a leather-clad, lonely boy. (DS) </p> <p><strong> Slimm Calhoun </strong> The Skinny<br> (Aquemini/Elektra) **** <br> </p> <p> Slimm is the first signing to Outkast's Aquemini label and as such is already being talked of as the next big playa from Atlanta's rap game. He's certainly got the tunes. With an old-skool feel to his beats and hooks big enough to land an octopus, his southern-fried rap style packs real gusto. \"The Skinny\" means \"street info\"; in practice, this means lots of stuff about bitches, hoes and dealing. But there's poignancy here too, even though it sometimes feels like Slimm has stumbled on it accidentally. It's OK's hookline - \"All these lonely girls just wanna fuck\" - contains an eerie, modern bleakness more powerful that braggadocio. Calhoun may be illiberal and confused, but he knows how society made him that way. (DS) </p> <p><strong> Mark Mulcahy</strong> Smile Sunset <br>(Loose) **** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> Sometimes a record comes along that is so magical, you almost wish its maker would never make another - a disappointing follow-up would be unbearable. Fathering, Mark Mulcahy's 1999 debut solo, was one of those records; thankfully, so is Smile Sunset. Its wonderful songs are by turns cheeky, subtle, rinkydink, passionate and simple, and Mulcahy's voice is so velvety you want to stroke it. A Cup of Tea and Your Insights ends with him repeating the line \" 'Cause I know that I could be all right\" for a couple of minutes, shaking it in the air like a silk sheet. The music is beautiful, enriched with cello, mandolin and piano accompaniments, but the best songs find Mulcahy alone, singing to his plaintive guitar and tinkling glockenspiel. Wake Up Whispering is a honeyed lullaby love song; even better is The Quiet One. It starts fluttery but kicks in with the lines \"What kind of drugs have you done tonight/ You've got a face like a lava light\", and starts to swirl satisfyingly in sync with that image.

      "bodyText": "Ruby Short-Staffed at the Gene Pool (Wichita) *** \u00a313.99 Despite favourable critical reaction to 1995's Salt Peter, her first album as Ruby, Lesley Rankine never lived up to the next-cool-thing status briefly conferred on her in the mid-1990s. Every ounce as bilious as sister Scot Shirley Manson, she lacks Manson's pop proclivities, so while the latter sells millions with Garbage, Rankine's trip-hoppy mutterings reach a more select audience. Short-Staffed at the Gene Pool has taken six years to materialise, during which Rankine lived in New Orleans and Seattle, adding new, mainly beats-based sounds to her portfolio. At the same time, her vocals acquired a feline sinuousness, though the feline is a tiger rather than a pussycat, claws unsheathed even at seductive moments. She titles a song Roses for the malevolent delight of whispering \"I don't smell like roses\", and another Sweet Is so that she can perversely claim \"Sweet is the wind that brings tragedy\". If Dido's too wet, try this. (CS) Isaac Hayes The Man! The Ultimate Isaac Hayes 1967-1977 (Stax) ***** \u00a314.99 Isaac Hayes's stock has plummeted of late, following a lacklustre mid-1990s comeback, scientology dabblings and South Park. However, from his solo debut in 1968 to his bankruptcy in 1977 with $6m of unsettled debts, he reinvented black music. For all his potential preposterousness, Hayes was a three-dimensional figure: his men openly ached. Today, rappers cover the bones of a song and build a new tale around it, but Hayes was there first. He wrestles with Walk On By for 12 minutes, while his extraordinary version of By the Time I Get to Phoenix takes 19 dignified minutes to reach its destination. Moreover, before the song itself kicks in, Hayes has narrated a harrowing back- story, recasting the saga in the ghetto. He could also up the tempo: Theme from Shaft is as taut and funky as it was nearly 30 years ago, while his finest moment was Ike's Mood 1, a symphonic instrumental which, by its climax, carries echoes of Ennio Morricone's Battle of Algiers - set, inevitably, in the ghetto. (JA) Janet Jackson All for You (Virgin) ** \u00a314.99 Despite giving every outward appearance of being uninterested in her musical career, Janet has been the most popular Jackson for a decade. She has been lucky, for while she receives a co-writing credit on all tracks, she is essentially the plaything of producers and co-songwriters Terry Lewis and Jimmy \"Jam\" Harris III. When they are on their game, creating absorbing backgrounds - on the exhilarating Trust a Try and the feisty duet with Carly Simon, Son of a Gun - then Jackson sounds as if she is the disco queen. Alas, for the most part here, Jam and Lewis tread water, resulting in a succession of lazy, anodyne ballads such as Truth and Better Days, which leave Jackson's underpowered voice overexposed. The nadir, however, is the embarrassing Would You Mind, where Jackson attempts sexy. \"I'm gonna kiss you, suck you, taste you, ride you,\" she claims, with laughable libidinousness. Tragically, her squeaky serenade is skin-crawlingly akin to being seduced by a member of Minipops. (JA) Serge Gainsbourg I Love Serge: Gainsbourg Electronica (Mercury) **** \u00a313.99 Ten years after his death, Serge Gainsbourg's reputation continues to precede him. Outside France, he remains better known as a lecherous old goat than a songwriter; when his songs are discussed, attention focuses on words before music. Unsurprising given Gainsbourg's lyrical preoccupation with farting and underage sex, but a shame: Gainsbourg took risks, experimenting freely with African rhythms, reggae and disco. Air and Portishead have revered his 1971 album Histoire de Melody Nelson, a fusion of tremulous orchestration and rhythmic punch. Sadly, neither grace this remix collection, and their absence is felt throughout Howie B's flat reworking of Ballade de Melody Nelson. Elsewhere, Gainsbourg's breathy growl is the perfect companion to an array of beats. Bob Sinclar remixes Marabout into joyful house and the Orb's Requiem Pour un Con surrounds slinky beats with a pervasive aura of sleaze. Gainsbourg, who once attempted to popularise a dance in which men jigged around clutching their partner's breasts, would undoubtedly approve. (AP) Firstborn When It Hits You, Feel No Pain (Independiente) ** \u00a314.99 Twenty-five years after its heyday, northern soul still reverberates through British music. You hear its echoes in the tinny euphoria former northern DJ Pete Waterman constructs for Steps and the rolling pianos behind Belle and Sebastian's bedsit melancholy. Its influence continues, unaffected by fashion, because northern soul has anachronism in-built: even during its mid-1970s peak, the scene's biggest records were 10 years old, relics of a Motown-influenced sound replaced by disco, yet still worshipped in England's north-west. Accordingly, northern soul has transcended its American origins and become shorthand for a particularly British, working-class combination of perseverance and escapism. Its slogan? \"Keep the faith.\" None of this is lost on Dublin producer Oisin Lunny, whose debut album fuses northern soul samples and pounding techno to create a grim picture of urban nightlife. But if Lunny understands northern soul's romantic image, the music's uplifting spirit has bypassed him: he unearths northern soul heroine Mary Love, then reworks her life-affirming Lay this Burden Down as a turgid dirge. Worse, Irish author Bennan Murphy rants, swears and humourlessly intones Bob Dylan lyrics throughout the album. Keeping the faith never sounded such hard work.

The beleaguered group made the announcement as it posted a 90% drop in profits to \u00a341m for the first three months of the year. Ericsson's vice-president, Roland Klein, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the reluctance of mobile phone companies to invest in next generation wireless networks had left the company with no alternative. \"We have to react to this because our organisation is tuned into growth in the area of 30%, as we had last year,\" he said. \"At the moment, the market is being hit very hard by the recession but also by the reluctance of operators to invest... but we trust our operation,\" he added.

      "body": "<p><strong> Ash </strong> Free All Angels <br>(Infectious Records) **** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> Nowadays it's not cool to be young and enjoy it. Instead, adolescence is surrounded by negativity and teenagers just bemoan the fact that they have their whole lives in front of them. Fun without responsibility has been diluted by the likes of Wheatus, who celebrate the poor personal hygiene and dodgy taste in music that youth entails, by Westlife and their middle-aged, middle-of-the-road sentiments, and by dismissive declarations of \"my generation\" from the greying Limp Bizkit. Where are the head-spinning thrills, the heart-stopping lust, the celebration of golden summer holidays that seem to last for ever? </p> <p>Step forward Ash, who (while they themselves wrestle with the complexities of mid-20s angst) have crystallised the pleasure and pain of being a teen. Back in 1996, when they kicked up some punk-pop dust with the single Kung Fu, Tim Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and Rick McMurray were the naughtiest kids in the Britpop class. Juggling a record deal with their A-levels, they hit the charts with the adrenaline-filled debut album 1977. Spawning indie classics Girl from Mars and Oh Yeah, 1977 conjured up playground longings and Kodak memories and set them to lush melodies and spiky guitars. Ash held on to their innocent exuberance, their Star Wars fixation and the knowledge that girls were an unknown but desired quantity. </p> <p>Following a foray into soundtracks with A Life Less Ordinary, Ash acquired a new guitarist in Charlotte Hatherley and released their second album, Nu-Clear Sounds. But the joy had evaporated into thrash and an affection for the Jesus and Mary Chain that vanquished the optimism and fun of the past. Personally, things weren't so great either. After two years of non-stop pop, the sweetness of success turned bitter for Wheeler, who gradually retreated into depression.

      "bodyText": "Ash Free All Angels (Infectious Records) **** \u00a313.99 Nowadays it's not cool to be young and enjoy it. Instead, adolescence is surrounded by negativity and teenagers just bemoan the fact that they have their whole lives in front of them. Fun without responsibility has been diluted by the likes of Wheatus, who celebrate the poor personal hygiene and dodgy taste in music that youth entails, by Westlife and their middle-aged, middle-of-the-road sentiments, and by dismissive declarations of \"my generation\" from the greying Limp Bizkit. Where are the head-spinning thrills, the heart-stopping lust, the celebration of golden summer holidays that seem to last for ever? Step forward Ash, who (while they themselves wrestle with the complexities of mid-20s angst) have crystallised the pleasure and pain of being a teen. Back in 1996, when they kicked up some punk-pop dust with the single Kung Fu, Tim Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and Rick McMurray were the naughtiest kids in the Britpop class. Juggling a record deal with their A-levels, they hit the charts with the adrenaline-filled debut album 1977. Spawning indie classics Girl from Mars and Oh Yeah, 1977 conjured up playground longings and Kodak memories and set them to lush melodies and spiky guitars. Ash held on to their innocent exuberance, their Star Wars fixation and the knowledge that girls were an unknown but desired quantity. Following a foray into soundtracks with A Life Less Ordinary, Ash acquired a new guitarist in Charlotte Hatherley and released their second album, Nu-Clear Sounds. But the joy had evaporated into thrash and an affection for the Jesus and Mary Chain that vanquished the optimism and fun of the past. Personally, things weren't so great either. After two years of non-stop pop, the sweetness of success turned bitter for Wheeler, who gradually retreated into depression. Cue 18 months of suffering, silence and recovery. But with Free All Angels, Ash have rediscovered their enthusiasm, and Wheeler - not just the singer but the band's chief songwriter - has a smile on his face. From the beginning, you know it's going to be good. Walking Barefoot has that trademark sense of nostalgia for a time you're still experiencing. A great festival song, it's about relishing a perfect moment while knowing it's about to come to an end. \"Remember when the sun was hot, remember when the days were long,\" Wheeler sings, a homage to both lazy days and golden years. The perfect pop ethic of simple, epic singalong songs continues with Shining Star, Ash's greatest single since Girl from Mars, a celebration of someone special in sixth-form prose.

      "body": "<p>If you had to identify a single defining characteristic in James Ellroy, it would be precision. Like his prose, stripped down like a hot rod, he displays no unnecessary flim-flam in his countenance - you see it in the manner he chisels cheese from the lip of his bowl of French onion soup. Even the weight of his dog, a white bull terrier named Dudley, is kept in optimum muscular form. \"You gotta keep the fuckers under 50lbs,\" he says. \"You don't let these guys become big 70lb tanks. It'll kill 'em dead.\" </p> <p>Ellroy, 52, is not the same man who wrote My Dark Places. Nor is he the same man who wrote the LA Quartet crime novels - The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, LA Confidential and White Jazz. He has moved on. His new book, The Cold Six Thousand, following 1995's American Tabloid, is the second of a planned trilogy that could be described as a semi-fictional account of American imperialism. The book extends the theme of \"bad white men doing bad things in the name of authority\" but Ellroy himself seems less the bad, bruising self-confident man he used to play himself as, though he still pretty sure about the value of his new book. </p> <p>\"I wanted to write a book that expresses a new mature ethos and I think I've done it,\" he says. \"I just reached a point in my career where I have to quit talking about my mother's murder and all that stuff. I want to work more quietly and circumspectly, to work for some wisdom and peace of mind. Hopefully we'll be seeing a calmer, more contemplative and truth-seeking Ellroy.\" </p> <p>The Cold Six Thousand does not betray any weariness; it is as brutal and fast-paced as its predecessor. Starting where American Tabloid left off - in Dallas on November 22 1963 - the book delves into the conspiratorial shadows of the Kennedys, J Edgar Hoover, the mob, Howard Hughes, the Klan, the civil rights movement, heroin and Vietnam, accompanied by Ellroy's own determinedly bad-ass fictional characters. </p> <p>\"It had to be perfect, it had to be the precisely perfect ordering of words, and it had to sound right to my ear across the board, and I didn't let it go until I thought it was perfect.\" </p> <p>For Ellroy, run-on sentences, multiple clauses, commas and semi-colons are the enemy. \"It's as stylistically pure a novel as you'll ever read. I like a period, a colon and a double-dash. There are no tricks to this style. It's propulsive, you can't blink or you'll miss things.\" </p> <p>For a writer who was not quite 12 at the dawn of the 60s and not quite 22 at the close, that momentous decade in American history is perfect Ellroy territory. \"It was that last gasp of pre-public accountability in America. These bad power-driven guys had their agendas and they got away with whatever they wanted.\" </p> <p>Through the fog of his own drug and alcohol addictions of that time and into the 70s, he held no interest in the aspirations of the anti-establishment counterculture - \"the only thing I did that they did was get bombed and try to get laid, unsuccessfully\" - but he sustained an intuitive sense of the personal stories working beneath the surface of events that now inform his work. </p> <p>\"When you look at James Earl Ray, and learn of the horrifying and hilarious facts of his life, or Robert Kennedy, what he went through when he realised his war on organised crime - in a sense, his oedipal drama because he was the only one of the Kennedy men to see through his father - was an attack on his father once removed, it sets fire to the imagination,\" he enthuses. \"So, I get to go back and tell the human story to those events and to rewrite history to my own specifications,\" he says. \"And that's very seductive.\" </p> <p>But despite the impression given by his books, Ellroy is not a conspiracist by nature. Conspiracies, such as the assassination of JFK, exist informally as consensus thinking, he holds. There was a consensus among powerful people that he had to go and a consensus among even more powerful people that the official version of how it happened was best for the country. </p> <p>\"I think it was an auspicious business dispute killing and nothing else. Jack betrayed some very bad people to betray, renegade CIA men, Cuban exiles, the mob. He fucked them and they killed him. Thus, by the rules he lived by, he was a traitor and he got what he deserved. He should have understood there are elements out there you don't betray. He naively trusted the power of his office, the power of his ascendancy, the power of his family name and he woefully miscalculated.\" </p> <p>Ellroy does not buy into the posturing and projections of moral righteousness that America likes to indulge. The idea that Kennedy's assassination marked the end of innocence, or was the crime of the century, doesn't wash with him. \"History is the crime of the American 20th century,\" he corrects. \"This country was never innocent. It's a crock of shit. This country was built on racism, slavery, religious persecution, land grabs, and the genocidal slaughter of the indigenous population.\" </p> <p>But he's also wary of being drawn into areas that are not, as a novelist, his to indulge. Readers and journalists often seek his opinion, often trying to define him by their perceived reaction to his views and anoint him as one of their own. \"The guy with Irish brogue raises his hand. Oh, shit. He wants to know what you think about Northern Ireland. Or you go to San Francisco, and some androgynous human being wants to know what you think about gay rights. It's nothing to do with me. It's not my job.\" </p> <p>Ellroy largely isolates himself from popular culture; he picks his period, immerses himself in it and does not seek contemporary parallel and metaphor. \"I was obsessively self-destructive and then I became obsessively constructive in the books I write.\" Distractions are minimised, especially those of popular culture. \"Words are my business and when I'm not putting them on paper, thinking about putting them on paper, planning to put them on paper, I don't want to be reading.\" His work is his passion, and the devils that once attended him have, if not departed, then are at least held at bay. </p> <p>But where he once sought constant, escalating stimulation, he now seeks something else. If violence and its attendant issues was once compelling and cathartic, it is now only interesting as a social phenomenon that paints a picture of a time and a place. </p> <p>Confusing the writer with his work is a dangerous game, of course, and Ellroy expresses surprise that he is often portrayed as a tough guy when, in truth, he had no stomach for serious crime or violence even as he lived a disordered and profligate life. \"I was pathetic, physically weak, drug and booze debilitated, a buffoon, and scared of my own shadow. But you know what? My shadow was something to be scared of. I saw the enemy and it was me.\" </p> <p>Nowadays, he may still push too hard, drive too hard and suffer bouts of insomnia, but the inner compulsions have been slayed by self-honesty and clarity and he now prefers to side with the forces of tenderness and calm, not the obsessive's need for constant stimulation whose only antidote is more stimulation. </p> <p>\"That thrill-seeking part ... the sensual part. Mental stimulation. Sex. Cultural stimulation. Sensory shit like food, a good meal. You get to a point where all that becomes such a fucking burden. Damnable temptations. After a while you want profundity in your life. I found a profound woman and that's that. Now I want to go to the next level of profundity and peace and I understand that I should step back at this point in my life.\" </p> <p>With one more book in the current trilogy to complete, Ellroy is casting around for a change of direction. He's looking to write a historical-political novel on the life of Warren Harding, US president between 1916 and 1924. Language and style will have to be adapted and changed but the essential theme of all his books - the morally and socially corrupted, white Anglo-Saxon heterosexual American man in extremis - will remain intact. </p> <p>\"I write about men better than anybody since Dashiell Hammett,\" Ellroy says, not in boast but with the certain knowledge that he is right. \"I know it in my bones. It may be time to say you've taken as far as it can go. Take an inventory. See where you've been, see where you're going and go there. Pick a direction.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Cold Six Thousand is published by Century, priced \u00a316.99.</p>",

Under new inner city planning rules, the corporation has to lose 600 parking places in its White City headquarters in west London, a move that has outraged staff who have enjoyed the perk for years. While most London workers, and indeed staff who work in BBC's central London offices, endure an arduous and unpleasant daily commute by tube, BBC staff insist they should be allowed to hold on to their free car park passes. One worker, who wrote to the in-house magazine Ariel, complained she lived in the countryside and could never catch the \"only bus home\". \"I can't be the only one in this position and yet it seems to be a case of 'you'll have to try to make alternative arrangements, move to London or leave the BBC',\" the staff member said. But an internal survey conducted for the corporation has revealed that up to 70% of those who use the car parks live in west London.

The BBC has a staggering 2,491 parking places at its disposal in five car parks around TV Centre and its White City headquarters, including a multistorey car-park. Commuters in London would have to pay \u00a320 a day or more to park in a private car park but BBC staff get this privilege free of charge. The quantity of car park passes at the BBC has astonished Hammersmith and Fulham council and the Greater London Authority, which are campaigning to persuade Londoners to leave their cars at home. Strict criteria for who gets to keep their parking passes are now being drawn up by a special car park committee. Those who work night shifts, such as camera crews and journalists, are likely to keep their passes, as will staff with disabilities. Women with young children are also likely to be high up on the priority list. And, inevitably, executives such as the heads of BBC1 and BBC2 and director-general Greg Dyke will be able to continue to use the car park.

The BBC will start losing some of these spaces next year when building work on its new White City development begins, but it will not have to give up all its places until 2004. A BBC spokeswoman said the BBC accepted it had to adopt a \"greener\" policy but was working in conjunction with the transport authorities for long-term improvements to transport and safety in the area. It has already installed cameras along Wood Lane and it is hoping to persuade rail authorities to redevelop an old underground station on Wood Lane. And it is hoping fewer than 600 people will be affected by the car park cutbacks. The corporation said it was also looking at installing more spaces for bicycles and motorbikes.

Anne Robinson's harsh presenting style may not have gone down well with American critics, but The Weakest Link increased its audience by more than 10m over three editions on NBC between Monday and Wednesday. The show, which was sold to NBC by BBC Worldwide, drew 25.1m viewers from 10pm-11pm on wednesday and was the most watched programme on any US network that evening. NBC estimates that more than 52m US viewers watched the show over its initial three-night run this week. Executives from the network will also be pleased that The Weakest Link is rating strongly among the key 18-49 demographic much sought after by advertisers. However, the US launch of The Weakest Link was backed by a massive NBC marketing blitz that will have boosted audience figures. It remains to be seen whether US viewers take to Ms Robinson's abrasive style when the show settles into its regular weekly slot next week for the rest of its 13-part run.

      "body": "<p>To a cock-a-hoop chorus of You'll Never Walk Alone and a carpet of scarves on the Kop Liverpool strode into their first European final in 16 years last night, ushered on their way by a helping Barcelona hand. </p> <p>While G\u00e9rard Houllier's side must have expected flashes of mind-boggling skill from Barca's world-class attackers, they could never have foreseen the moment of madness from Patrick Kluivert that settled this nail-biting tie. </p> <p>With two minutes remaining before half-time and Kluivert defending a Gary McAllister corner, the former Ajax forward mistimed his jump and, with Frank de Boer and Sami Hyypia lurking behind, flicked his hand at the cross. The Scot gleefully converted the penalty. </p> <p>Having weathered a nerve- racking ending, which saw incessant pressure if few clear chances, Liverpool can add a Uefa Cup final against Alaves in Dortmund to their already cramped fixture list. </p> <p>\"Being in a European final means so much to everyone at the club,\" said Houllier. \"That was a true team performance; we defended and attacked as a team. If you look at the two games we've not had a lot of chances even if we've had plenty of possession. </p> <p>\"But we've defended in a very clever way. I knew if we opened the play in the Nou Camp we wouldn't have a chance there. But I knew we had a chance here. The fans helped make it a wonderful European night.\" </p> <p>That the second leg of this semi-final would produce more attacking pizzazz than the first was inevitable given the mind-numbing tedium of the Nou Camp stalemate a fortnight ago. Liverpool's stifling tactics that night prompted the Spanish media to round on Houllier for betraying Liverpool's traditions. </p> <p>But, with Barca drawing their two previous games in La Liga 4-4 and Liverpool having notched their 100th goal of the season across Stanley Park on Monday, a repeat of the cagey jousting never looked likely. </p> <p>Such optimism swelled as the home side tore into the visitors from the outset. Steven Gerrard fizzed around midfield like a man possessed. From his incisive pass Markus Babbel's cross, swirling in the wind, was palmed behind unconvincingly by Jose Manuel Reina. The goalkeeper retained an air of vulnerability as he scrambled the ball away after Vladimir Smicer slipped Michael Owen into the area. </p> <p>Hyypia and Smicer both threatened with headers yet, for all Liverpool's pressure, danger was ever only one flash of Rivaldo's awesome talent away. The Brazilian - gliding between opponents, all pirouettes and majestic flicks - gathered possession on the halfway line after eight minutes, advanced and launched an Exocet from 40 yards destined for the top right-hand corner ; Sander Westerveld did well to tip it behind. </p> <p>That spurred Barca on, Emmanuel Petit twice blazing horribly into the Kop while the Frenchman's former Arsenal team-mate Marc Overmars, a roadrunner up and down the left flank, terrorised Babbel. After 33 minutes the Dutch international tore to the goalline, cut back and saw Luis Enrique squirm a shot wide with Westerveld beaten. </p> <p>Yet Liverpool were handed the lead through Kluivert's misdemeanour before the in terval. The striker's immediate glance at the official betrayed his guilt. A flashing drive across Westerveld's goal at the start of the second period may have been spurred by a desire to make amends. </p> <p>Not that it prompted the expected barrage of chances for Barcelona. But the nerves jangling through the stands were exacerbated by Petit's innocuous punt forward that Westerveld air-kicked on the edge of his area.

      "bodyText": "To a cock-a-hoop chorus of You'll Never Walk Alone and a carpet of scarves on the Kop Liverpool strode into their first European final in 16 years last night, ushered on their way by a helping Barcelona hand. While G\u00e9rard Houllier's side must have expected flashes of mind-boggling skill from Barca's world-class attackers, they could never have foreseen the moment of madness from Patrick Kluivert that settled this nail-biting tie. With two minutes remaining before half-time and Kluivert defending a Gary McAllister corner, the former Ajax forward mistimed his jump and, with Frank de Boer and Sami Hyypia lurking behind, flicked his hand at the cross. The Scot gleefully converted the penalty. Having weathered a nerve- racking ending, which saw incessant pressure if few clear chances, Liverpool can add a Uefa Cup final against Alaves in Dortmund to their already cramped fixture list. \"Being in a European final means so much to everyone at the club,\" said Houllier. \"That was a true team performance; we defended and attacked as a team. If you look at the two games we've not had a lot of chances even if we've had plenty of possession. \"But we've defended in a very clever way. I knew if we opened the play in the Nou Camp we wouldn't have a chance there. But I knew we had a chance here. The fans helped make it a wonderful European night.\" That the second leg of this semi-final would produce more attacking pizzazz than the first was inevitable given the mind-numbing tedium of the Nou Camp stalemate a fortnight ago. Liverpool's stifling tactics that night prompted the Spanish media to round on Houllier for betraying Liverpool's traditions. But, with Barca drawing their two previous games in La Liga 4-4 and Liverpool having notched their 100th goal of the season across Stanley Park on Monday, a repeat of the cagey jousting never looked likely. Such optimism swelled as the home side tore into the visitors from the outset. Steven Gerrard fizzed around midfield like a man possessed. From his incisive pass Markus Babbel's cross, swirling in the wind, was palmed behind unconvincingly by Jose Manuel Reina. The goalkeeper retained an air of vulnerability as he scrambled the ball away after Vladimir Smicer slipped Michael Owen into the area. Hyypia and Smicer both threatened with headers yet, for all Liverpool's pressure, danger was ever only one flash of Rivaldo's awesome talent away. The Brazilian - gliding between opponents, all pirouettes and majestic flicks - gathered possession on the halfway line after eight minutes, advanced and launched an Exocet from 40 yards destined for the top right-hand corner ; Sander Westerveld did well to tip it behind. That spurred Barca on, Emmanuel Petit twice blazing horribly into the Kop while the Frenchman's former Arsenal team-mate Marc Overmars, a roadrunner up and down the left flank, terrorised Babbel. After 33 minutes the Dutch international tore to the goalline, cut back and saw Luis Enrique squirm a shot wide with Westerveld beaten. Yet Liverpool were handed the lead through Kluivert's misdemeanour before the in terval. The striker's immediate glance at the official betrayed his guilt. A flashing drive across Westerveld's goal at the start of the second period may have been spurred by a desire to make amends. Not that it prompted the expected barrage of chances for Barcelona. But the nerves jangling through the stands were exacerbated by Petit's innocuous punt forward that Westerveld air-kicked on the edge of his area. Kluivert gave chase but the ball ran out; with it went Barca's chance. \"We cannot underestimate Alaves,\" added Houllier. \"I know a lot about them and they are a very good team. But this was a fantastic achievement.\" \u0095Alaves cruised through to the Uefa Cup final with a 4-1 win over Kaiserslautern for a 9-2 aggregate victory . France's Youri Djorkaeff gave the home side an early lead but two goals from the substitute Jurica Vucko and one each from Ivan Alonso and Raul Ganan secured a comfortable win for the Spanish side. Liverpool (4-4-2): Westerveld; Babbel, Hyypia, Henchoz, Carragher; Smicer (Fowler, 81min), Gerrard (Murphy, 78), Hamann, McAllister; Heskey, Owen (Berger, 63). Barcelona (4-2-3-1): Reina; Puyol, Reiziger (Simao, 60), De Boer, Cocu; Petit, Guardiola; Luis Enrique, Rivaldo, Overmars (Dani, 74); Kluivert. Referee : U Meier (Switzerland).",

      "bodyText": "Fifa's plans for the next World Cup are in chaos following the sacking of the tournament's marketing chief. Patrick Magyer was running the competition's promotional campaign for Swiss company ISL, which owns the marketing rights to the 2002 World Cup. It is alleged he was plotting with football's governing body against his own company, which is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Fifa sold the marketing rights for the 2002 World Cup to ISL in 1996 for \u00a31.2bn, but the deal saddled ISL with too much debt and left the company's management split over how to deal with the crisis. An ISL spokeswoman confirmed Mr Magyer had left the company but would not give reasons for his departure. Fifa has now created its own marketing operation, Fifa Marketing, in case ISL's \u00a3300m debt burden drags it under and the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea is left without a marketing campaign. ISL has been given three months' bankruptcy protection by a Swiss court and is counting on a rescue deal with German TV company UFA to pull it through. Otherwise, the world's largest football tournament will be paralysed with no one to sell sponsorship packages or arrange corporate hospitality. The ISL fiasco has added to the growing criticism of Fifa's handling of the 2002 World Cup. German media group Kirch was sold the European TV rights to the tournament for \u00a3670m. It has been forced to auction off the rights to pay-TV stations in order to recoup the costs, sparking a furious reaction from UK TV bosses and MPs. Kirch is sweeping the UK auction under the carpet until the general election is over. The media group fears the negative publicity will put off possible buyers, who include Kirch pay-TV shareholder BSkyB. Fifa has been accused of milking the World Cup for all it is worth and restricting public access to the tournament as a result. Fifa was unavailable for comment.

He told the inquiry that herculean efforts had been made to locate anything of possible relevance, but most papers would have been shredded after this length of time. But Mr Adams said it was unimaginable that Bloody Sunday material had not been considered important enough to keep and he did not believe it had been disposed of. \"If the material was destroyed, there must be a motive or reason for this, and in those circumstances those persons who gave authorisation for destruction must provide an explanation,\" he said. Mr Adams's Sinn Fein colleague, Martin McGuinness, a former Provisional IRA leader in Derry, has said he will take the stand at the inquiry. Lawyers have criticised the wall of silence surrounding IRA activity on Bloody Sunday, and five members of the Official IRA, from which the Provisionals split in the early 1970s, have asked for anonymity in return for their testimony.",

If GPs were to move towards being an emergency-only service outside the NHS, we would have lost something precious. That's not what we want and not what the government wants.\"",

      "body": "<p>The government is considering introducing powerful new conspiracy laws to tackle up to 200 master criminals who are effectively untouchable because current legislation does not give the police enough powers to tackle them.</p> <p>Senior police officers have urged the Home Office to pursue initiatives similar to the anti-racketeering act in the US, which was credited with crushing the mafia .</p> <p>The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organisations Act (Rico) allowed federal agents to target the organising entity behind a crime, \"not merely the act\" itself. By concentrating on the conspiracy behind a crime, investigators were able to target mafia bosses as well as their footsoldiers.</p> <p>Sir David Phillips, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officer's policing committee, has supported the use of laws modelled on Rico in private advice to the Home Office, believing they could prove an essential crime-fighting tool.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned the Home Office is now circulating a classified consultation paper titled the Prosecution of Organised Criminal Conspiracy to gauge reaction to Rico- style laws from agenciessuch as customs and excise and the crown prosecution service, before deciding what to do.</p> <p>Concern in Whitehall that a premier league of criminals is prospering with impunity was bolstered last year with the findings of a confidential UK threat assessment report, compiled by the national criminal intelligence service (NCIS).</p> <p>An abridged version of the report was given to the media but the full document was only presented to ministers.</p> <p>An investigation into organised crime published in today's Economist newspaper claims to have uncovered further confidential details about the extent of criminality in the UK.</p> <p>The Economist says it has seen classified NCIS documents that refer to a group of 150 \"core nominals\" - intelligence-speak for crime bosses - and around 750 lieutenants who work for them.

      "bodyText": "The government is considering introducing powerful new conspiracy laws to tackle up to 200 master criminals who are effectively untouchable because current legislation does not give the police enough powers to tackle them. Senior police officers have urged the Home Office to pursue initiatives similar to the anti-racketeering act in the US, which was credited with crushing the mafia . The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organisations Act (Rico) allowed federal agents to target the organising entity behind a crime, \"not merely the act\" itself. By concentrating on the conspiracy behind a crime, investigators were able to target mafia bosses as well as their footsoldiers. Sir David Phillips, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officer's policing committee, has supported the use of laws modelled on Rico in private advice to the Home Office, believing they could prove an essential crime-fighting tool. The Guardian has learned the Home Office is now circulating a classified consultation paper titled the Prosecution of Organised Criminal Conspiracy to gauge reaction to Rico- style laws from agenciessuch as customs and excise and the crown prosecution service, before deciding what to do. Concern in Whitehall that a premier league of criminals is prospering with impunity was bolstered last year with the findings of a confidential UK threat assessment report, compiled by the national criminal intelligence service (NCIS). An abridged version of the report was given to the media but the full document was only presented to ministers. An investigation into organised crime published in today's Economist newspaper claims to have uncovered further confidential details about the extent of criminality in the UK. The Economist says it has seen classified NCIS documents that refer to a group of 150 \"core nominals\" - intelligence-speak for crime bosses - and around 750 lieutenants who work for them. It says the number of such criminals increases by a third every year. NCIS yesterday denied that these figures were part of its confidential threat assessment report. Nevertheless, it has warned repeatedly about the increasing threat of organised crime in areas like drugs smuggling, illegal arms sales, and immigration rackets. The willingness of the Home Office to consider new powers for the police became apparent yesterday when it emerged that a leading criminologist, Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, was asked to prepare a paper on methods used by other countries to tackle organised crime. His report highlighted the effectiveness of Rico laws in the US, but also questioned whether such laws would work in the UK. Sir David Phillips, the chief constable of Kent, has advocated the use of similar laws to Lord Justice Auld, who is preparing a report on root and branch reform of the criminal justice system. \"The bottom line is this,\" said a Home Office spokes man. \"We want to prosecute these top criminals and make them 'touchable'. _ At the moment, there is no real consensus on Rico-style laws, though the police are generally positive. We hope to publish the findings of the consultation later this year.\" Last month the home secretary, Jack Straw, unveiled a new law to use civil powers to confiscate ill-gotten fortunes worth \u00a3220m. The draft proceeds of crime bill, to be introduced later this year, would set up a criminal assets recovery agency charged with the task of hunting down cash, houses, cars and other wealth accumulated through criminal activity.",

      "body": "<p>Given the similarities between British and Indian bureaucracy, it had to happen sooner or later. Yesterday one of India's leading TV channels launched a Hindi version of the classic 80s political comedy Yes Minister following a unique collaboration with the BBC. </p> <p>The adaptation, Ji Mantriji, faithfully follows all 38 episodes of the much-loved series, starring Sir Nigel Hawthorne and the late Paul Eddington, but with Indian actors. </p> <p>Gone is Jim Hacker, the flappable minister advised - rarely to his advantage - by his suave permanent secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby. In their places are characters Surya Prakash Singh, who eventually rises to become prime minister, like his sometimes naive British counterpart, and Rajnath Mathur. </p> <p>While the scripts are almost identical to the original series, a few references have been tweaked to place them in an Indian context. Football becomes cricket, the European community the Commonwealth, and Russia becomes Pakistan - India's perennial foe. </p> <p>A memorable episode in which the minister's daughter threatens to strip naked unless he stops the demolition of a badger sanctuary features monkeys instead. </p> <p>\"This is the first time the BBC has completely recreated a series for the Indian market or for anyone else in the world,\" said Mark Young, the BBC's India managing director. The experiment would be repeated if Ji Mantriji was a success, he added. </p> <p>Ji Mantriji, which is being screened by the Star TV channel from next week, stars a comedy actor, Farooque Sheikh, in the Jim Hacker role, with Jayant Kripalani as Sir Humphrey. Paritosh Sand plays the role of Bernard, the minister's private secretary. The series, like its predecessor, has a sequel, Ji Pradhanmantriji, or Yes Prime Minister. </p> <p>\"When I saw Yes Minister 20 years ago I thought the part was written for me - except I was Indian, brown and in the wrong country,\" Mr Kripalani said yesterday. \"It came as a joyous surprise when I was offered the role. </p> <p>\"All the long, convoluted sentences Sir Humphrey used to speak work beautifully in Hindi,\" he added. \"The series adapts very well because the systems of democracy and the bureaucracies in Britain and India are pretty much the same.\" </p> <p>To ensure authenticity, Ji Mantriji's director Smeeta Chakrabati called in on several Indian ministers before filming began last summer.

      "bodyText": "Given the similarities between British and Indian bureaucracy, it had to happen sooner or later. Yesterday one of India's leading TV channels launched a Hindi version of the classic 80s political comedy Yes Minister following a unique collaboration with the BBC. The adaptation, Ji Mantriji, faithfully follows all 38 episodes of the much-loved series, starring Sir Nigel Hawthorne and the late Paul Eddington, but with Indian actors. Gone is Jim Hacker, the flappable minister advised - rarely to his advantage - by his suave permanent secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby. In their places are characters Surya Prakash Singh, who eventually rises to become prime minister, like his sometimes naive British counterpart, and Rajnath Mathur. While the scripts are almost identical to the original series, a few references have been tweaked to place them in an Indian context. Football becomes cricket, the European community the Commonwealth, and Russia becomes Pakistan - India's perennial foe. A memorable episode in which the minister's daughter threatens to strip naked unless he stops the demolition of a badger sanctuary features monkeys instead. \"This is the first time the BBC has completely recreated a series for the Indian market or for anyone else in the world,\" said Mark Young, the BBC's India managing director. The experiment would be repeated if Ji Mantriji was a success, he added. Ji Mantriji, which is being screened by the Star TV channel from next week, stars a comedy actor, Farooque Sheikh, in the Jim Hacker role, with Jayant Kripalani as Sir Humphrey. Paritosh Sand plays the role of Bernard, the minister's private secretary. The series, like its predecessor, has a sequel, Ji Pradhanmantriji, or Yes Prime Minister. \"When I saw Yes Minister 20 years ago I thought the part was written for me - except I was Indian, brown and in the wrong country,\" Mr Kripalani said yesterday. \"It came as a joyous surprise when I was offered the role. \"All the long, convoluted sentences Sir Humphrey used to speak work beautifully in Hindi,\" he added. \"The series adapts very well because the systems of democracy and the bureaucracies in Britain and India are pretty much the same.\" To ensure authenticity, Ji Mantriji's director Smeeta Chakrabati called in on several Indian ministers before filming began last summer. An office decorated with pot plants, a portrait of Gandhi and an Indian flag resulted, replacing Jim Hacker's wood-panelled inner sanctum. Some of the scenes are shot in India's monumental parliament building. Surya Prakash Singh is driven round in a white Ambassador car with blue curtains- rather than a Rover. When he becomes prime minister he gets a Honda. \"My favourite episode is when the minister gets a death threat. We had to make very few changes, because if anything security is even tighter here than in the UK,\" Ms Chakrabati said. The original Yes Minister series, first screened in 1980 on BBC2, gained a huge following among India's English-speaking middle class after it was shown on Doordashan, the state-run channel. Most TV pundits expect Ji Mantriji to be a runaway hit - though a few sceptics have questioned whether it will work. \"Both Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister are so typically British that having them performed in any other language would be akin to murder,\" columnist V Gangadhar declared recently in the Hindustan Times. \"How can the Hindiwallas recreate immortal characters such as James Hacker and Humphrey Appleby?\" he asked. Indian audiences have long grown used to watching foreign imports - most Bollywood films borrow their plots from Hollywood blockbusters. They are still glued to Kaun Banega Crorepati?, India's gripping version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? There have even been Hindi versions of Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights. The BBC is so confident of success it is sending a boxed set of Ji Mantriji to India's elderly prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and his cabinet as a \"gesture\". \"He has a sense of humour. I'm not so sure about his party,\" Mr Kripalani said.",

      "bodyText": "A volunteer ambulanceman from Greater Manchester was jailed for 6 years yesterday for a string of assaults on boys under his supervision. Ken Whittaker, 67, from Denton, used his position as a volunteer with the St John's Ambulance Brigade to molest and rape the boys who attended the charity organisation's headquarters in Tameside to learn life saving techniques. Whittaker was found guilty at Minshull Street crown court in Manchester of two rapes, one attempted rape, six inde cent assaults and three charges of indecency with a child. He will stay on the sex offender register for life and was disqualified from working with children. Whittaker managed to conceal nearly 50 years of abuse from his wife Mary. It was not until one of his victims, now aged 24, came forward last year after spotting him in the street that the extent of what he had done was revealed. Police discovered that in 1954 Mottram magistrates fined him \u00a310 for indecently assaulting an eight-year-old boy outside a sports pavilion and in August 1957 he was put on probation for a similar assault on a 10-year-old boy. David Lane QC, prosecuting, told the court that brigade chiefs were unaware of his past when he became a volunteer ambulanceman. There he formed friendships and gained the trust of parents who believed his pretence of offering extra tuition to spend time alone with the boys. The men who gave evidence had kept their ordeal secret for more than 15 years Judge Peter Lakin told Whitaker: \"You breached the trust placed in you.\"",

      "body": "<p>Alarm that thousands of animals were being slaughtered unnecessarily has led the Ministry of Agriculture quietly to drop its policy of killing all animals on farms next to infected premises within 48 hours.</p> <p>So many tests of samples taken from animals diagnosed as having foot and mouth proved negative after slaughter that ministry vets began to doubt that the original diagnoses were correct.</p> <p>The change was ordered in a series of briefings to vets after the Easter weekend. Unless vets were absolutely certain of diagnosis then healthy animals should be left alive until the government's laboratory at Pirbright in Surrey had confirmed the case.</p> <p>This reverses the prime minister's decision on March 23 that all animals suspected of having foot and mouth must be killed within 24 hours and animals on neighbouring farms within 48 hours. Those targets have never been met.</p> <p>The problem has arisen because sheep are not seriously ill with the disease and it is difficult to diagnose.</p> <p>There have been an increasing number of cases where a few sheep are believed to have the disease and as a result large numbers of healthy valuable cattle have been killed.</p> <p>Yesterday the chief scientist, David King, said the culling policy remained in place although \"exceptions\" were being made.</p> <p>The system, in place since March 23, has been modified. Previously when vets found a suspect case, they decided on instant slaughter.</p> <p>This was confirmed in a telephone call to Whitehall where Maff vets are on standby to discuss symptoms. Only if there was serious doubt about the diagnosis were tests taken. Now vets have been warned that they must be certain before ordering slaughter and animals must be given \"the benefit of the doubt\" until confirmation comes through.</p> <p>With the epidemic on the wane and a backlog of already condemned animals still to be slaughtered, this cautious approach is expected to save many pedigree animals.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

      "bodyText": "Alarm that thousands of animals were being slaughtered unnecessarily has led the Ministry of Agriculture quietly to drop its policy of killing all animals on farms next to infected premises within 48 hours. So many tests of samples taken from animals diagnosed as having foot and mouth proved negative after slaughter that ministry vets began to doubt that the original diagnoses were correct. The change was ordered in a series of briefings to vets after the Easter weekend. Unless vets were absolutely certain of diagnosis then healthy animals should be left alive until the government's laboratory at Pirbright in Surrey had confirmed the case. This reverses the prime minister's decision on March 23 that all animals suspected of having foot and mouth must be killed within 24 hours and animals on neighbouring farms within 48 hours. Those targets have never been met. The problem has arisen because sheep are not seriously ill with the disease and it is difficult to diagnose. There have been an increasing number of cases where a few sheep are believed to have the disease and as a result large numbers of healthy valuable cattle have been killed. Yesterday the chief scientist, David King, said the culling policy remained in place although \"exceptions\" were being made. The system, in place since March 23, has been modified. Previously when vets found a suspect case, they decided on instant slaughter. This was confirmed in a telephone call to Whitehall where Maff vets are on standby to discuss symptoms. Only if there was serious doubt about the diagnosis were tests taken. Now vets have been warned that they must be certain before ordering slaughter and animals must be given \"the benefit of the doubt\" until confirmation comes through. With the epidemic on the wane and a backlog of already condemned animals still to be slaughtered, this cautious approach is expected to save many pedigree animals.

      "bodyText": "Farmers gripped by the foot and mouth crisis should be given new government grants to become \"land stewards\" sensitive to the needs of the environment, an official report to the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, proposed. The hill farms task force report, commissioned by Mr Brown, proposed a hill environment land management payment to recognise the value of hill farms to environmental protection, maintenance of the countryside and rural communities. The report suggested the crisis \"could provide an opportunity to encourage a less intensive and more environmentally friendly way of farming\". It continued: \"The future could be one in which animals do not have to travel so far, local markets reduce the roles of the middle man and the big chains, and the environmental output of the hills - which underpins tourism and quality of life for society - is properly rewarded.\" The proposals are likely to be central to the debate on the future of farming, and Britain's approach to the common agriculture policy following the election and the end of the foot and mouth outbreak. Ministers have already hinted at an inquiry into the future of farming following the election. There is likely to be a contest between those in government who favour bigger, more efficient farms and those who support grants to encourage environmental land management. The report proposed shifting more of the \u00a33.5bn spent on farming each year into supporting environmental farming. Ministers expect large numbers of older farmers to quit the land following the crisis. But the task force counseled: \"Should land be abandoned it will profoundly change the landscape which people expect to see when they visit the uplands. We think there is an urgent need for action to sustain the landscape and wildlife which is now as valuable a product as the stock hill farmers traditionally produce.\" The proposed hill environment fund would eventually replace the existing environmental enhancements included in the Ministry of Agriculture's hill farm allowance and would bring the aid back up to at least \u00a342m a year. Ministers are planning to cut payments to hill farmers by \u00a320m in three years as part of a move to focus payments on acreage rather than number of animals, especially sheep. The hills task force was chaired by David Arnold-Forster from English Nature, and included members of the National Farmers' Union. Its report found most hill farmers, many hit by foot and mouth, were desperately short of cash, though nominally asset rich. Most hill farmers were receiving \u00a35,500 a year. The report warned: \"Before the foot and mouth outbreak, most hill farmers had no financial cushion to withstand future shocks and many were only surviving at all because of income earned off the farm, often by the wife. \"Foot and mouth will tip more hill farmers over the brink. Some may not want to restock, even if they could ... all would need to reassess their stocking policies.\" The proposed grants would be focused on issues such as animal density, the length of field boundaries and the cost of maintaining the landscape, including dry stone walls. There would also be additional payments to special areas of conservation or common land.

Oaklands Park in Gloucestershire, a Rudolf Steiner community of 115 people, 100 sheep and 60 cows, had contested the culling of its animals for almost two weeks - but with slaughtermen expected in yesterday, it unexpectedly won a reprieve. According to Maff, the government will now not slaughter the animals or pursue the community through the courts and will only require it to monitor its animals. It was unclear last night whether the government backed off the Oaklands animals because it was a respected care in the community centre with 50 people with learning difficulties, and because of a strong media presence. \"They would have looked even more obscene and ridiculous trying to snatch lambs away from children or killing cows with people chained to their legs,\" said one Oaklands resident yesterday. The victory, which came after several hundred sympathisers from all over the country joined the community's barricades yesterday morning, could throw the whole \"contiguous\" slaughter policy into further confusion if it is challenged by other dissenting farmers. The policy will be contested later today with Maff going to the courts to try to gain entry to eight farms on Anglesey which are resisting culling of their healthy animals. Farmers in Devon, Northumbria and Cumbria may also seek recourse to to the courts. \"We have been fighting not just for ourselves but for many others who want vaccination\", said Andrew Thompson, an Oaklands director yesterday. \"Perhaps this is a turning point. We had a strong legal case. The animals were clearly not infected. Vaccination is the answer and we still want the possibility of our animals being inoculated.\" However the Christian-based community, which has been going 30 years and has bred its animals to be docile with people with learning difficulties, must wait until next Wednesday for the official expiry of the notice requiring the animals to be culled. \"Sincere resistance can go a long way,\" said Oaklands gardener Tyll Van Der Voort. \"This is a human rights issue as much as one of animal welfare.

      "body": "<p>During the late 50s, when fears of Soviet nuclear attack began to quicken, with a certain amount of encouragement from western governments, the US Air Force proposed a controversial counter-measure: a ballistic missile early warning system should be built, involving radar stations sited as close as possible to where the attack would supposedly be launched. In other words not in America at all, but on European soil.</p> <p>Suitable locations needed to be near the sea, with an unobstructed view of the horizon. They had to be high up, with enough distance and difficult terrain between them and the shoreline to deter any raiding party landed by submarine. And they had to be in a country that was used to giving America what it wanted.</p> <p>In 1959, the British government was asked if Prestwick, an existing US Air Force base south of Glasgow, could be expanded to take the new radar. But there was a problem: the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was gaining momentum, and the radar's presence near a large left-wing city would draw protesters. Moreover, they would have a point; as the American magazine Aviation Week admitted, the radar \"would make the area a prime target\". The British said no to Prestwick. In 1960, the Americans tried again.

America intends to shoot down enemy missiles. Exactly who this enemy might be is no longer a matter of western consensus.

People think it's mad, and people think it's dangerous.\" And even worse than the American cruise missiles so contentiously deployed at Greenham Common, he adds, the British parts of NMD would require local planning permission and an extension of the bases in question. \"You are going to get everybody from the Women's Institute to CND on your back if this thing is built.\"</p> <p>Yet, in the way of Anglo-American relations since the second world war, Britain is getting ready to agree. Officially, the Ministry of Defence maintains that no specific American proposals have been received.

Since last summer, a pair of smooth white globes have sprouted, mounted on white stalks like great button mushrooms, amid the older huts and domes of this long-established American listening station on the moors.

There are a few signs of this happening. The CND website has recorded an increase in visitors since Bush took office. \"I've taken calls from people who have said, 'I want to rejoin,'\" says Nigel Chamberlain, who deals with inquiries about Star Wars.

While Menwith Hill and its opponents are on the fringe of urban Yorkshire, with its protester networks and peace studies academics, Fylingdales is far to the north, in a more rural and conservative area. Since it was built, handfuls of local people have helped to staff it, while others have sent questioning journalists on their way with gruff statements of support for the Americans.

The nostalgic police series about Yorkshire in the early 1960s, Heartbeat, is filmed here; there is an immaculate little station for the local steam railway; the local shops, busy with tourists, have freshly painted period facades. You could say Goathland depends for its existence on maintaining certain illusions about an eternal, independent England. \"People who think differently are not always keen to say so,\" says Jackie Fearnley, one of the village's few critics of Fylingdales.</p> <p>She moved north from Suffolk a few years ago. Slightly unsuitable plants struggle in her front garden. She wears two oatmeal jumpers and a rainbow scarf as we sit in her living room. She speaks cautiously, at first, about opposing the radar station. \"People are saying, 'Could there be another Greenham Common at Fylingdales?', but I don't think so.\" She looks resigned for a moment. \"My children ask me now what Greenham Common was.\"</p> <p>Instead, a few weeks after Bush took office, Fearnley drove down to Whitby on the coast and met up with three other people with experience of activism against GM food and nuclear weapons. They formed the Fylingdales Action Network, with the single aim of making any local contribution to Star Wars politically impossible. The group now has about 50 members, has held two meetings and one demonstration, and is very concerned not to seem too militant. There was considerable debate, at the start, as to whether the word \"action\" was too aggressive.</p> <p>But the case the group makes against NMD (now being hastily renamed Ballistic Missile Defense, or plain Missile Defense as opposition swells in Europe) is a fundamental one. \"How would the Americans feel,\" asks Fearnley, \"if we put something in their national park?\" She raises her quiet voice slightly: \"This seems like yet another example of America wanting to have their wars fought away from their home territory.\"</p> <p>The American embassy in London insists it is listening to such criticisms: \"The concerns of our allies have to be taken into account.\" But in Whitby last week, at a meeting of Fearnley's fellow activists, the air was thick with suspicion of American intentions in general. The confrontation with China, the rejection of the Kyoto agreement on global warming, the international ambitions of American corporations - this was the pattern into which the eight mild, middle-class people in the borrowed living room fitted the likely expansion of Fylingdales. That Britain should remain one of Washington's \"allies\" at all was implicitly questioned in every polite sentence.</p> <p>It is just possible that a prolonged public battle over Star Wars will finally end this unequal relationship. At the least, enough messy arrests on the North York moors could lead, ultimately, to the dismantling of America's many British bases. \"If they were challenged, things would crumble rather fast,\" says Michael Codner of the Institute for Defence Studies. One day, \"these things will seem to be rather extraordinary\". Even after almost 40 years, Fylingdales and Menwith Hill do not appear on civilian maps.</p> <p>Then again, America's current dominance of the world is extraordinary in itself.

      "bodyText": "During the late 50s, when fears of Soviet nuclear attack began to quicken, with a certain amount of encouragement from western governments, the US Air Force proposed a controversial counter-measure: a ballistic missile early warning system should be built, involving radar stations sited as close as possible to where the attack would supposedly be launched. In other words not in America at all, but on European soil. Suitable locations needed to be near the sea, with an unobstructed view of the horizon. They had to be high up, with enough distance and difficult terrain between them and the shoreline to deter any raiding party landed by submarine. And they had to be in a country that was used to giving America what it wanted. In 1959, the British government was asked if Prestwick, an existing US Air Force base south of Glasgow, could be expanded to take the new radar. But there was a problem: the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was gaining momentum, and the radar's presence near a large left-wing city would draw protesters. Moreover, they would have a point; as the American magazine Aviation Week admitted, the radar \"would make the area a prime target\". The British said no to Prestwick. In 1960, the Americans tried again. This time, they suggested somewhere so bleak and remote that, they successfully argued, even the most determined peace campaigners would not want to linger: Fylingdales. Up on this bald rust-brown moor above Whitby in north Yorkshire, late spring feels like midwinter. The wind is a blast of invisible ice cubes off the North Sea. There are few trees or walls to interrupt the lowering clouds or the records collected by meteorologists.

      "bodyText": "The government is considering introducing powerful new conspiracy laws to tackle up to 200 master criminals who are effectively untouchable because current legislation does not give the police enough powers to tackle them. Senior police officers have urged the Home Office to pursue initiatives similar to the anti-racketeering act in the US, which was credited with helping to bring the mafia to its knees in Chicago, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organisations Act (Rico) allowed federal agents to target the organising entity behind a crime, \"not merely the act\" itself, giving almost unlimited powers for surveillance and allowing judges to pass discretionary sentences and fines. By concentrating on the conspiracy behind a crime, investigators were able to target mafia bosses as well as their foot-soldiers. Sir David Phillips, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officer's policing committee, has supported the use of laws modelled on Rico in private advice to the Home Office, believing they could prove an essential crime-fighting tool. The Guardian has learned the Home Office is now circulating a classified consultation paper titled the Prosecution of Organised Criminal Conspiracy to gauge reaction to Rico-style laws from agencies such as customs and excise and the crown prosecution service, before deciding what to do. Concern in Whitehall that a premier league of criminals is prospering with impunity was bolstered last year with the findings of a confidential UK threat assessment report, compiled by the national criminal intelligence service (NCIS). An abridged version was given to the media but the full, classified document, believed to identify Britain's 200 most influential criminals, was presented to ministers. An investigation into organised crime published in today's Economist magazine claims to have uncovered further confidential details about the extent of criminality in the UK. The Economist says it has seen classified NCIS documents that refer to a group of 150 \"core nominals\" - intelligence-speak for crime bosses - and around 750 lieutenants who work for them. The magazine says the number of such criminals increases by a third every year. NCIS yesterday denied that these figures were part of its confidential threat assessment report. Nevertheless, it has warned repeatedly about the increasing threat of organised crime in areas like drugs smuggling, illegal arms sales, and immigration rackets. The willingness of the Home Office to consider new powers for the police became apparent yesterday when it emerged that a leading criminologist, Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, was asked to prepare a confidential paper on methods used by other countries to tackle organised crime. His report highlighted the effectiveness of Rico laws in the US, but also questioned whether such laws would work well in the UK. Sir David Phillips, the chief constable of Kent, has advocated the use of similar laws to Lord Justice Auld, who is preparing a report on root and branch reform of the criminal justice system. The Home Office confirmed yesterday that a consultation document drawing together the key elements of Professor Levi's paper and police views was being circulated. \"The bottom line is this,\" said a spokesman. \"We want to prosecute these top criminals and make them 'touchable'. \"We want to make the laws as effective as possible to do this ... At the moment, there is no real consensus on Rico-style laws, though the police are generally positive. We hope to publish the findings of the consultation later this year.\" Last month the home secretary, Jack Straw, unveiled a new law to use civil powers to confiscate ill-gotten fortunes worth \u00a3220m from 39 gangsters who have so far escaped criminal conviction.

      "body": "<p>It has not taken Ariel Sharon long to steer himself and his government on to the rocks. Just six weeks after he took office he has moved to occupy Palestinian territory and then been forced to withdraw because of American displeasure, thrown away what international credit he had by bombing Syrian positions in Lebanon, announced new building programmes in the West Bank in spite of earlier pledges not to do so, and rejected proposals for mutual disengagement as \"a ruse.\" His actions have pushed Palestinians and Israelis into a more dangerous cycle of violence and raised the possibility of a wider war. The real ruse, which seems even more apparent now than it did during the election campaign, is the trick which Sharon played on Israeli voters when he assured them he had a plan which would bring them peace and security.</p> <p>The Israeli commentator Amos Elon observed in one of his essays that \"Over the centuries Jews have been accused of many things but not of being stupid.\" The unusual Jewish stupidity to which he was referring then was that of the Netanyahu government, which, in 1997, with the aggressive clumsiness which was its trademark, was stumbling into confrontation with the Palestinians. As a result, Elon wrote, \"Israel found itself at the mercy of blind forces.\" Four years later, Binyamin Netanyahu's misjudgments pale by comparison with those of Sharon, and both Israelis and Palestinians are far more at the mercy of \"blind forces\" than they were at that earlier time. The stupidity which the Sharon government embodies lies in the old man's view that he can bludgeon his way toward a sort of peace, battering the Palestinians into unconditional surrender, and then awarding them less than half of the West Bank in exchange for iron-clad guarantees of good behaviour.</p> <p>Such a \"victory\" cannot be won. It is a fantasy, and Sharon probably knows that it is a fantasy. He serves it up to justify what his instincts dictate, which is that Palestinian attacks must be countered with whatever force is necessary for them to be brought to an end. And it is conceivable, such is the desperate condition of Palestinian civilians, that Yasser Arafat may at some point feel he has no option but to agree to a ceasefire on Israeli terms. But could anyone believe that such a ceasefire would represent anything but a pause in the violence? Sharon's plan is also a fantasy because of the way in which it elevates Arafat to a position of impossible authority and strength. What leader in any country can bind a people to a settlement wholly repugnant to them, and what leader would not be weakened, perhaps terminally, by trying to do so? Peace, in the end, is between peoples as well as between leaders.</p> <p>Sharon began his government with a two-track policy: he would be tougher than his predecessor, Ehud Barak, in responding to Palestinian attacks, but at the same time Shimon Peres, as his foreign minister, had a brief to re-open negotiations with the Palestinians. The contradictions were instantly obvious. The tougher military policy made it harder, not easier, for Peres to succeed in an already very difficult task, as Sharon and other members of his government undermined the foreign minister by making it clear how little they were ready to concede to the Palestinians if they laid down their arms. The contradictions in Sharon's own position also began to grind against each other. He had acted, at the beginning, with, by his lights, a degree of restraint. Yet many of those who had voted for him, and especially the settlers, had expected a dramatic escalation. He was known as a hammer of the Palestinians: when was he going to begin hammering?</p> <p>You could call what has happened in recent weeks Shalhevet's war. The killing toward the end of March by Palestinian fire of this little baby girl in Hebron was one of those tragic events that tip a balance waiting to be tipped. Settlers demanded a more vigorous response and got it. Sharon explained that \"The turning point will come when Arafat begins to realise - and I believe this is becoming clear to him - that my government will not negotiate under terror and violence.\" His home minister, Uzi Landau, explained that \"The price we will extract from the Palestinians will become intolerable.\" This policy of relentless pressure has led the Israeli government to reject attempts by third parties to bring about a mutual disengagement. Endorsed by Jordan, Egypt, and some European countries, the scheme in question is a version of earlier American proposals under which the Israelis would withdraw from the edges of Palestinian civilian areas, lifting their various sieges, and the Palestinians would resume security cooperation. Political negotiations would follow. Whether the Palestinians would sincerely accept such a plan is moot, because the Israelis have so far refused to do so. Their public position remains that Israel will not negotiate under fire.</p> <p>Yet in trying to exact Uzi Landau's price, and in going beyond the limits of military action which it had until then observed, the Israeli government has run into another set of limits. Put simply, the United States, the European Union, and the main Arab states are unlikely to tolerate a creeping reoccupation of the territory over which the Palestinians took control under the Oslo accords. Nor are they likely to sit quietly if hostilities threaten across the Lebanese or Syrian borders. The US alone of these three has a leverage which Israel can never ignore. It exerted that leverage sharply this week when it in effect ordered the Israeli army out of Beit Hanoun in Gaza. Washington had earlier condemned Israeli building plans. The Bush administration has made it clear that it will not mediate in the way its predecessor did, but that does not mean it can afford to look the other way while a Sharon government creates havoc. The Europeans have far less influence, yet they are financing the Palestinian Authority, and the trading relationship between Israel and Europe is critical. The Arabs have least influence, but exerted via America and Europe by the Arab oil states and by Egypt and Jordan, it is not inconsiderable.</p> <p>This makes Sharon's game more difficult, since it had begun to depend on an escalation which has now been internationally blocked. The result is a government which has no realistic plans to negotiate and no realistic chance of escalating the conflict without itself paying a very high price. It is also an ill assorted coalition government, even by Israeli standards. Elements on the right will be enraged by the way in which Israeli actions have been stymied by other countries.

      "bodyText": "It has not taken Ariel Sharon long to steer himself and his government on to the rocks. Just six weeks after he took office he has moved to occupy Palestinian territory and then been forced to withdraw because of American displeasure, thrown away what international credit he had by bombing Syrian positions in Lebanon, announced new building programmes in the West Bank in spite of earlier pledges not to do so, and rejected proposals for mutual disengagement as \"a ruse.\" His actions have pushed Palestinians and Israelis into a more dangerous cycle of violence and raised the possibility of a wider war. The real ruse, which seems even more apparent now than it did during the election campaign, is the trick which Sharon played on Israeli voters when he assured them he had a plan which would bring them peace and security. The Israeli commentator Amos Elon observed in one of his essays that \"Over the centuries Jews have been accused of many things but not of being stupid.\" The unusual Jewish stupidity to which he was referring then was that of the Netanyahu government, which, in 1997, with the aggressive clumsiness which was its trademark, was stumbling into confrontation with the Palestinians. As a result, Elon wrote, \"Israel found itself at the mercy of blind forces.\" Four years later, Binyamin Netanyahu's misjudgments pale by comparison with those of Sharon, and both Israelis and Palestinians are far more at the mercy of \"blind forces\" than they were at that earlier time. The stupidity which the Sharon government embodies lies in the old man's view that he can bludgeon his way toward a sort of peace, battering the Palestinians into unconditional surrender, and then awarding them less than half of the West Bank in exchange for iron-clad guarantees of good behaviour. Such a \"victory\" cannot be won. It is a fantasy, and Sharon probably knows that it is a fantasy. He serves it up to justify what his instincts dictate, which is that Palestinian attacks must be countered with whatever force is necessary for them to be brought to an end. And it is conceivable, such is the desperate condition of Palestinian civilians, that Yasser Arafat may at some point feel he has no option but to agree to a ceasefire on Israeli terms. But could anyone believe that such a ceasefire would represent anything but a pause in the violence? Sharon's plan is also a fantasy because of the way in which it elevates Arafat to a position of impossible authority and strength. What leader in any country can bind a people to a settlement wholly repugnant to them, and what leader would not be weakened, perhaps terminally, by trying to do so? Peace, in the end, is between peoples as well as between leaders. Sharon began his government with a two-track policy: he would be tougher than his predecessor, Ehud Barak, in responding to Palestinian attacks, but at the same time Shimon Peres, as his foreign minister, had a brief to re-open negotiations with the Palestinians. The contradictions were instantly obvious. The tougher military policy made it harder, not easier, for Peres to succeed in an already very difficult task, as Sharon and other members of his government undermined the foreign minister by making it clear how little they were ready to concede to the Palestinians if they laid down their arms. The contradictions in Sharon's own position also began to grind against each other. He had acted, at the beginning, with, by his lights, a degree of restraint. Yet many of those who had voted for him, and especially the settlers, had expected a dramatic escalation. He was known as a hammer of the Palestinians: when was he going to begin hammering? You could call what has happened in recent weeks Shalhevet's war. The killing toward the end of March by Palestinian fire of this little baby girl in Hebron was one of those tragic events that tip a balance waiting to be tipped. Settlers demanded a more vigorous response and got it. Sharon explained that \"The turning point will come when Arafat begins to realise - and I believe this is becoming clear to him - that my government will not negotiate under terror and violence.\" His home minister, Uzi Landau, explained that \"The price we will extract from the Palestinians will become intolerable.\" This policy of relentless pressure has led the Israeli government to reject attempts by third parties to bring about a mutual disengagement. Endorsed by Jordan, Egypt, and some European countries, the scheme in question is a version of earlier American proposals under which the Israelis would withdraw from the edges of Palestinian civilian areas, lifting their various sieges, and the Palestinians would resume security cooperation. Political negotiations would follow. Whether the Palestinians would sincerely accept such a plan is moot, because the Israelis have so far refused to do so. Their public position remains that Israel will not negotiate under fire. Yet in trying to exact Uzi Landau's price, and in going beyond the limits of military action which it had until then observed, the Israeli government has run into another set of limits. Put simply, the United States, the European Union, and the main Arab states are unlikely to tolerate a creeping reoccupation of the territory over which the Palestinians took control under the Oslo accords. Nor are they likely to sit quietly if hostilities threaten across the Lebanese or Syrian borders. The US alone of these three has a leverage which Israel can never ignore. It exerted that leverage sharply this week when it in effect ordered the Israeli army out of Beit Hanoun in Gaza. Washington had earlier condemned Israeli building plans. The Bush administration has made it clear that it will not mediate in the way its predecessor did, but that does not mean it can afford to look the other way while a Sharon government creates havoc. The Europeans have far less influence, yet they are financing the Palestinian Authority, and the trading relationship between Israel and Europe is critical. The Arabs have least influence, but exerted via America and Europe by the Arab oil states and by Egypt and Jordan, it is not inconsiderable. This makes Sharon's game more difficult, since it had begun to depend on an escalation which has now been internationally blocked. The result is a government which has no realistic plans to negotiate and no realistic chance of escalating the conflict without itself paying a very high price. It is also an ill assorted coalition government, even by Israeli standards. Elements on the right will be enraged by the way in which Israeli actions have been stymied by other countries. Others may be regretting their decision to join. All will be preparing for the next phase in Israeli politics, in which Sharon may play no part. Only 35% of Israelis voted for him, it is worth remembering. Many of these must now know that the man who said he had a plan has not even the beginning of a solution to their problems.

Sitting the crazed girl down in a tranquil hospital room, police psychologist Embeth Davidtz begins piecing together what went wrong. Part-funded by the Film Council, The Hole provides a textbook example of a certain business-savvy strain of modern British movie. Certainly the set-up is intriguing, and the whole thing handled with a definite zip by director Nick Hamm. Yet in the end The Hole isn't half as smart as it thinks it is. The playing is too shrill, too strident; the plot twists not so much revelations as show-off card tricks.",

      "body": "<p>Rocio Saenz gives a very convincing performance as a union organiser in Ken Loach's new film, Bread and Roses. She shows just the right blend of determination and controlled conviction as she addresses the people who clean the buildings of corporate Los Angeles, trying to inspire them with commitment for the battles ahead. </p> <p>But if anyone should be able to play a passionate union activist, it is the 37-year-old from Mexico City in her first - and probably last - role in what is Loach's first - and probably last - film made in the United States. </p> <p>Saenz, one of a family of nine, arrived as a young woman from Mexico in 1986 hoping to study. \"That was the wish - and then I hit reality,\" she says now. She had to settle for work cleaning houses and baby-sitting and eventually decided to look for slightly better paid employment in LA's garment industry. She approached the local garment workers' union so that they could direct her to a factory that at least paid the basic rates, and they thought she was looking for work in the union itself. Through this misunderstanding she found herself making banners and gradually being drawn into the world of the unions. \"Until then I only knew the horrible side of the US but when I started to go out organising with these people it was: 'Wow! Incredible!' - it was another world.\" </p> <p>At the time, the union movement in LA was much weaker than today, when the city is regarded as the fastest-growing union city in the US, a growth mainly attributed to the large numbers of Latinos in the service industries of cleaning, catering and hotel work. One key task when Saenz first started work was the organising of the janitors, the people who clean the office buildings and who had traditionally been underpaid and exploited, not least because many of them were \"undocumented\" - illegally in the country and thus unable to complain. So Saenz found herself as an organiser with the Service Employees International Union in what became known as the Justice for Janitors' campaign. This hit the headlines in June 1990 when riot police attacked one of their marches in Century City and 60 marchers were hospitalised after bloody scenes. Amidst the ensuing public dismay at the violence, which was shown on television, 2,000 janitors won union recognition. </p> <p>Seven years ago the Scottish writer Paul Laverty (who also scripted Loach's films My Name is Joe and Carla's Song) sought Saenz's advice for a screenplay on the theme of the immigrant worker. She met Loach the following year and in 1999 found herself playing a union organiser in the film, alongside actors Adrien Brody (The Thin Red Line, Summer of Sam) in the role of middle-class union activist Sam Shapiro, and Pilar Padilla in her debut feature role as Maya, a Mexican immigrant whose illegal entry across the border starts the film. A number of real-life janitors and union activists found themselves, like Saenz, recruited to play characters much like themselves. In the scene in which Rocio delivers her rallying speech, many of the extras were workers she had been responsible for organising in real life. </p> <p>Saenz, who is now based in the Bay Area of Oakland, says it was a surprise to find that the people interested in making a film about the union battles of LA should have come all the way from Britain in order to do so. \"It was always a puzzle that here he [Ken Loach] was doing a film in the middle of this big monster.\" </p> <p>As to how well Loach has captured the life of the janitors, she adds: \"I'm not objective, of course, but I think it is very accurate. The movie has got both the sad and the funny sides of it.\" Saenz says that few films had portrayed the experiences of the Latino immigrant worker in the US and cited El Norte, Gregory Nava's 1983 film about Guatemalans reaching the promised land of California, as the best. \"What people don't realise is what the immigrant has to go through to achieve the American dream. You have to leave your family and go through a horrible experience and go through discrimination and racism. But things have changed. When I first started organising, people would say: 'Why don't you go back to your own country, you wetback.' \" </p> <p>Los Angeles had a reputation for being anti-union that dated back to 1910, when two labour officials were convicted of planting a bomb at the LA Times, which killed 20 people. The city now, though, seems to be smiling on union activities. During the janitors' strike the general public contributed some $2m to their fighting fund. Many of the strikers' demands were met, and their wages increased by 25% over the next few years. </p> <p>Last year was a record-breaking year for recruitment in Saenz's union and she feels Loach's film will spread the message further in a country where unionisation hovers around the 13% mark in the workforce. She says that the themes in Bread and Roses - the right to organise and the conditions that people work under - are universal: \"Immigration is an issue everywhere in the world, not just in LA.\" </p> <p>Saenz is right in thinking that not many people would think of making a film about the benefits of union organisation in 2001. There have been films about unions and workers getting organised before but most seem to be from a distant age. On the Waterfront, of course, made in 1954, dealt with the issue of labour organising, and Norma Rae, which won an Oscar for its star Sally Field in 1979, painted a heroic picture of the union activist. Matewan, the 1987 John Sayles film, painted an equally heroic picture of striking miners. FIST, with Sylvester Stallone, in 1978, dealt with the rise and fall of a union boss, and Hoffa, made in 1992, tackled the life of the Teamsters' boss, Jimmy Hoffa. </p> <p>In Britain, The Angry Silence (1960) portrayed unions as totalitarian and menacing, penalising the little guy, the individual, the non-conformist. (\"A vicious film,\" Loach has called it.) I'm All Right, Jack (1959), while a comedy, carried the subtext that the union official was a humourless bureaucrat.

      "bodyText": "Rocio Saenz gives a very convincing performance as a union organiser in Ken Loach's new film, Bread and Roses. She shows just the right blend of determination and controlled conviction as she addresses the people who clean the buildings of corporate Los Angeles, trying to inspire them with commitment for the battles ahead. But if anyone should be able to play a passionate union activist, it is the 37-year-old from Mexico City in her first - and probably last - role in what is Loach's first - and probably last - film made in the United States. Saenz, one of a family of nine, arrived as a young woman from Mexico in 1986 hoping to study. \"That was the wish - and then I hit reality,\" she says now. She had to settle for work cleaning houses and baby-sitting and eventually decided to look for slightly better paid employment in LA's garment industry. She approached the local garment workers' union so that they could direct her to a factory that at least paid the basic rates, and they thought she was looking for work in the union itself. Through this misunderstanding she found herself making banners and gradually being drawn into the world of the unions. \"Until then I only knew the horrible side of the US but when I started to go out organising with these people it was: 'Wow! Incredible!' - it was another world.\" At the time, the union movement in LA was much weaker than today, when the city is regarded as the fastest-growing union city in the US, a growth mainly attributed to the large numbers of Latinos in the service industries of cleaning, catering and hotel work. One key task when Saenz first started work was the organising of the janitors, the people who clean the office buildings and who had traditionally been underpaid and exploited, not least because many of them were \"undocumented\" - illegally in the country and thus unable to complain. So Saenz found herself as an organiser with the Service Employees International Union in what became known as the Justice for Janitors' campaign. This hit the headlines in June 1990 when riot police attacked one of their marches in Century City and 60 marchers were hospitalised after bloody scenes. Amidst the ensuing public dismay at the violence, which was shown on television, 2,000 janitors won union recognition. Seven years ago the Scottish writer Paul Laverty (who also scripted Loach's films My Name is Joe and Carla's Song) sought Saenz's advice for a screenplay on the theme of the immigrant worker. She met Loach the following year and in 1999 found herself playing a union organiser in the film, alongside actors Adrien Brody (The Thin Red Line, Summer of Sam) in the role of middle-class union activist Sam Shapiro, and Pilar Padilla in her debut feature role as Maya, a Mexican immigrant whose illegal entry across the border starts the film. A number of real-life janitors and union activists found themselves, like Saenz, recruited to play characters much like themselves. In the scene in which Rocio delivers her rallying speech, many of the extras were workers she had been responsible for organising in real life. Saenz, who is now based in the Bay Area of Oakland, says it was a surprise to find that the people interested in making a film about the union battles of LA should have come all the way from Britain in order to do so. \"It was always a puzzle that here he [Ken Loach] was doing a film in the middle of this big monster.\" As to how well Loach has captured the life of the janitors, she adds: \"I'm not objective, of course, but I think it is very accurate. The movie has got both the sad and the funny sides of it.\" Saenz says that few films had portrayed the experiences of the Latino immigrant worker in the US and cited El Norte, Gregory Nava's 1983 film about Guatemalans reaching the promised land of California, as the best. \"What people don't realise is what the immigrant has to go through to achieve the American dream. You have to leave your family and go through a horrible experience and go through discrimination and racism. But things have changed. When I first started organising, people would say: 'Why don't you go back to your own country, you wetback.' \" Los Angeles had a reputation for being anti-union that dated back to 1910, when two labour officials were convicted of planting a bomb at the LA Times, which killed 20 people. The city now, though, seems to be smiling on union activities. During the janitors' strike the general public contributed some $2m to their fighting fund. Many of the strikers' demands were met, and their wages increased by 25% over the next few years. Last year was a record-breaking year for recruitment in Saenz's union and she feels Loach's film will spread the message further in a country where unionisation hovers around the 13% mark in the workforce. She says that the themes in Bread and Roses - the right to organise and the conditions that people work under - are universal: \"Immigration is an issue everywhere in the world, not just in LA.\" Saenz is right in thinking that not many people would think of making a film about the benefits of union organisation in 2001. There have been films about unions and workers getting organised before but most seem to be from a distant age. On the Waterfront, of course, made in 1954, dealt with the issue of labour organising, and Norma Rae, which won an Oscar for its star Sally Field in 1979, painted a heroic picture of the union activist. Matewan, the 1987 John Sayles film, painted an equally heroic picture of striking miners. FIST, with Sylvester Stallone, in 1978, dealt with the rise and fall of a union boss, and Hoffa, made in 1992, tackled the life of the Teamsters' boss, Jimmy Hoffa. In Britain, The Angry Silence (1960) portrayed unions as totalitarian and menacing, penalising the little guy, the individual, the non-conformist. (\"A vicious film,\" Loach has called it.) I'm All Right, Jack (1959), while a comedy, carried the subtext that the union official was a humourless bureaucrat. Elsewhere in Europe, movies with union themes also seem to be from a different era: Eisenstein's Strike (1924) was about a 1912 strike; and Adalen 31, Bo Widerberg's film about a strike at a smalltown paper mill, was made in 1969. Bread and Roses is likely to be the last movie Loach makes in the US, his experience confirming his suspicions that, for most European directors, Hollywood is not a happy experience. But he believes there are many wonderful American stories still to be explored in movies, including \"some of the big historical subjects . . . Mother Jones [the turn-of-the-century American labour leader], Joe Hill [the labour organiser executed in 1915] and all the great heroic characters from the past, the history that people have been denied. History as mystery - it's the old quote of George Orwell: 'Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past.' People have no sense of the labour struggle in the US.\" Ironically enough, people may soon be getting a better sense of the labour struggle in the US through the entertainment industry itself. There are potential strikes brewing for both writers and actors that could close down the industry for weeks or even months this summer and Hollywood is busily finishing off projects in anticipation. Loach has long been back in Britain, where he is completing work on \"a little comedy with a sting in the tail\" called The Navigators. It's about the railway workers who check the tracks. It would be safe to assume that it is not a paean to privatisation. As for Rocio Saenz, would she like to swap her job as a union organiser for a career in the movies? \"It would be OK if all films were like Ken Loach's and not Hollywood, but the union is where my blood is.\" Bread and Roses is released on April 27.",

Jack Vizzard, another PCA administrator in the 1960s, had some interesting observations about mid-century Irish Catholic ideas of sex and violence. \"To the Irish,\" he opined, \"violence was not necessarily connected with the debasing of human life.

New York's Cardinal Francis Spellman - who, like J Edgar Hoover, was a total hypocrite about his own homosexuality - personally awarded the film a \"C for condemned\" rating, which meant that Catholics who saw it would languish in hell.

But as Allen curls up on her living-room sofa, dressed in a black T-shirt, jeans and minimal make-up, there's no trace of that mysterious reticence. She sits very straight, like a dancer, and talks about her sky-rocketing celebrity with candour. \"People I've run into on the street tell me I look like a young Joan Allen!\" she laughs. </p> <p>But if the sudden fame means that strangers now approach the actress to wish her well (\"I ride the subways and buses a lot,\" she admits), it hasn't changed her lifestyle: \"Maybe it's because I grew up in the midwest, and my mother always said, 'If you want something done right, do it yourself!' I have to fight that part of my temperament, but it's kind of hilarious sometimes. One minute I'm pushing the vacuum cleaner, the next I'm getting orchids from Giorgio Armani. By the day after the Oscar nomination, so many things were coming in that I was like, 'Where am I going to put all of this?'\" </p> <p>Twice nominated for the Academy award for best supporting actress - for her compassionate portrayal of Pat Nixon opposite Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone's Nixon in 1996, and for an electrifying performance as the wronged Elizabeth Proctor in The Crucible, co-starring Daniel Day-Lewis the following year - Allen has been cast over and over as \"the wife\". Her film husbands have included everyone from Bruce Willis (In Country), to Liam Neeson (Ethan Frome), and more recently Kevin Kline (The Ice Storm) and John Travolta (Face/Off). </p> <p>In Ang Lee's searing family drama The Ice Storm, Allen plays a repressed kleptomaniac suburban housewife, a taut, emotional performance that was immediately followed by a role in John Woo's action thriller Face/Off. \"That was fun. I got to scream, break a chair over John Travolta's back and even hold a gun!\" she says. In her subsequent film, Pleasantville, a take-off of a 1950s sitcom, Allen's naive character experiences a sexual awakening, but it was still light years away from a chance to explore smouldering sensuality. </p> <p>Which is why Allen's latest role, as the poised politician Laine Hanson in The Contender, was a welcome change. \"It was nice to finally say, 'I'm not married to the senator, I am the senator,'\" she quips. Written and directed by Rod Lurie, who had the actress in mind when he wrote the script (\"She's a female Gregory Peck!\" he says), the movie sees Allen play a highly respected politician who is nominated by the president (Jeff Bridges) to replace the deceased vice-president. </p> <p>It isn't long before Runyon, an unscrupulous congressman played by Gary Oldman, digs up a sex scandal from the senator's college days that escalates into lurid front-page headlines. Throughout the film, Allen's character subtly balances her inner rage with a cool exterior, maintaining her dignity by refusing to comment on the malicious accusations. </p> <p>\"The danger was to make her too self- righteous,\" Allen admits. \"I really wanted her to be as three-dimensional as possible, but I'm also conscious that it's a very reserved performance. When we rehearsed my final speech in court we tried it a few different ways - varying degrees of bombastic - and then I did it very simply. I don't know if that's very . . . umm . . . movie-like,\" she smiles, \"but it felt right. Keeping her cool was her way of fighting - never let them see you sweat!\" </p> <p>Echoes of Hillary? Allen had the chance to observe the former First Lady at a lawn reception at the White House at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. \"When Hillary got up to speak, the applause went on and on and on before she could say a word,\" the actress recalls. \"It was quite a moment.\" </p> <p>To prepare for the role, Allen met 38-year-old Arkansas senator Blanche Lincoln: \"She was helpful but told me she generally felt equally treated and that women are well protected by the constitution. What helped crystallise my perspective during the filming was when the director, Rod Lurie, pointed out that 50% of the American population is not seriously considered for the highest office in the land.\" </p> <p>Most importantly, the actress wanted her character to appear comfortable with her own sexuality, even though the whole story is based on an alleged sexual issue. \"If you look at high-profile female politicians like Madeleine Albright and Janet Reno, they're always dressed in conservative clothes, real no-nonsense stuff, and their sexuality is like . . . non-existent. One thing I decided about Laine's costumes was that I wouldn't wear a single pearl - no silk scarves with eagles on them, no brooches.\" </p> <p>Allen pauses and gets up to close the door to the kitchen, where the parrot is cheerfully shrilling. \"For some reason, I think it's hard to be glamorous and be taken seriously in the US,\" she states quietly, much in the way that Senator Hanson would have said it. </p> <p>Growing up in the cornfields of the Illinois town Rochelle (population 8,700), where her father owned a gas station, Allen was an excellent student, but spent much of her time after school playing with the family dog. \"In high school I was very shy but desperate to meet boys, so my sister told me to be a cheerleader. I didn't make the squad and auditioned for a play instead. After feeling like an outsider on the nerd end of the scale, I realised that I absolutely loved acting - I could cry, scream and laugh but in a controlled environment.\" </p> <p>Allen went on to major in theatre at Eastern Illinois University and was soon approached by an older student, John Malkovich. \"He wore these pearlised purple platform shoes with bell-bottoms and had a beard and long hair,\" Allen remembers. \"And I was like, this little smalltown, goody-two-shoes kind of girl. He was so exotic that I felt like I'd arrived on another planet.\" Malkovich later convinced Allen to join Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, where he and actors like Gary Sinise and Laurie Metcalf were staging productions in a small neighbourhood church in Highland Park. </p> <p>With a full-time day job as a secretary and rehearsals at night, Allen describes the early Steppenwolf days as an exhilarating time of passionate friendships, hard work, intensive partying and unexpected success. She debuted on Broadway in 1983 in And a Nightingale Sang, and five years later she won a best actress Tony award for her performance opposite Malkovich in Lanford Wilson's Burn This. </p> <p>That same year, while playing Delores in Wendy Wasserman's The Heidi Chronicles, Allen met actor Peter Friedman. They were married in 1990 and now have a seven-year-old daughter, Sadie, who is the actress's top priority. \"Maybe because I'm a mother now I don't have the same feeling that I must act or I'll die,\" Allen says. \"But Sadie has also taught me a lot - a child gives you an intensity of feelings that I've never felt before and she's probably made me a better actress.\" </p> <p>By the same token, Allen's decision to take a break from the long runs on stage and try out film was based on what she calls \"a burn-out\" from having to re-enact the same wrenching emotions night after night. She leans forward: \"You know, the characters I was playing were really sad.\" </p> <p> I f all goes as planned, Allen is looking forward to producing and starring in her next film, which takes place in Dublin and France. \"The character is somewhat comic. She's very ballsy, drinks a lot and gets very angry when she drinks.\" Allen acquired a feel for Dublin after spending six and a half months there filming The Sky Is Falling, directed by John Mackenzie, based on the true story of Irish journalist Veronica Guerin, who was murdered in 1996 after investigating Dublin drugs gangs. Though Allen immersed herself in Guerin's articles and TV interviews and worked daily with a dialect coach, she acknowledges that there are difficulties attached to a biopic, as she experienced in Nixon. \"You want to try to show thecomplexity - some people in Ireland feel that Veronica Guerin was very naive and foolish to have done what she did . . . especially as a mother.\" </p> <p>This reminds her that it's nearly time to pick up Sadie from school, and Allen also has an important conference call with her stylist in LA, whom she's never actually met. \"It's been a clothes nightmare,\" Allen laughs, \"so I finally decided to hire someone. Last year, for the Golden Globe awards, I tried to do it by myself. I had a huge pile of dresses at home and I took polaroids with a self-timer to send to my publicist. Hollywood is a full-time job.\" </p> <p>Allen maintains there wasn't any disappointment about not winning the Oscar, since for her, \"being nominated was significant tribute enough\". In fact, she felt equally honoured to have been chosen to present Ang Lee (who calls Allen \"a director's dream\") as a nominee at the Director's Guild awards. </p> <p>\"I'd never seen any martial arts movies before, and I thought his film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was unbelievable,\" Allen declares. Could she ever imagine herself in an intrepid-female-hero role? \"I would have loved to fly around on wires, through the air, bouncing from tree to tree. Oh my God, would I ever!\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Bob Godfrey looks as if he's been assembled by a cartoonist. Big nose, sticky-out ears, scrubby beard, hangdog expression. The thought crosses your mind that the godfather of British animation may well have invented himself. </p> <p>At 80, Godfrey is still hard at it in his cramped, chaotic studio in King's Cross, London, hunched over a desk, busily turning dignity on its head and subverting conventions. He is currently working on a five-minute cartoon series called Kevin Saves the World, based on a children's book by Danny Postgate about a boy who befriends a Martian. The walls are lined with cartoons, film posters and artwork stretching back half a century. As you mount the narrow stairs of the three-storey building, you're greeted by Godfrey's gallery of grotesques, the main purpose of which, he tells me, is to save him having to decorate. </p> <p>A proudly displayed Oscar and three Baftas look more than a little incongruous among the dog-eared pin-ups and creative detritus of his tiny command module. Looming over these gleaming awards, on the shelf above, is a stuffed arctic fox with a permanent snarl. \"Somebody from Norway sent it to me, Christ knows why,\" he chuckles. </p> <p>The Oscar was for Great, an animated musical about Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1975, when he became the first British animator to receive one. The story of how he came to win it is a nice mixture of enterprise and serendipity. </p> <p>\"I was showing my films to some students in Leicester Square, and an American guy came up to me and asked me how much I wanted for Kama Sutra Rides Again (1971), an earlier cartoon of mine. He said he liked it so much he wanted to give it to his son as a wedding present. I had a rough old 16mm print so I sold it to him for \u00a3150. I didn't give it another thought until I heard I'd been nominated for an Oscar for Kama Sutra, which came as a complete surprise since, so far as I knew, it had never been distributed in the States. </p> <p>\"If I could get an Oscar nomination without even trying, why didn't I put my mind to it? I'd been reading a book about Brunel so I asked British Lion, who backed Kama Sutra, if I could have some money to make a half-hour cartoon about a Victorian engineer. Yes, they said, here's \u00a320,000. They thought the sun shone out of my arse at the time. They'd have given me money to animate a toilet if I'd asked them.\" No doubt the top brass at British Lion trusted Godfrey to keep within his budget and bring in a film that marginalised engineering in favour of sex, politics and cheap laughs. </p> <p>Bob Godfrey started out as a graphic artist for Lever Brothers in the 1930s, advertising \"soap and sausages\", before joining a Rank subsidiary that was trying to copy the success of Walt Disney. They called it Animaland. </p> <p>He got his lucky break in 1950 when he was taken on by the innovative Larkin Studio, which was trying to combine the American comic strip with modern art. \"They asked me what I knew about making animated films and I said 'Nothing,' and they said, 'Good, you can start Monday.' Everything was very compartmentalised then, so I just did backgrounds. I didn't like it when I saw the finished films with all these characters moving about in front of my beautiful backgrounds.\" </p> <p>He decided to have a go at making his own films instead. He bought a handle-turned camera for \u00a32 in Edgware Road, rigged it up on a stand, and positioned a few tin cans to light up the artwork. \"It felt like I was discovering film 50 years after everyone else. I'd rush down to the developers with 27 feet of film. I was so thrilled when it came back in focus.\" </p> <p>By the time commercial TV started in 1955, Godfrey had set up his own studio in Soho - Biographic - with two other artist-animators, and managed to produce a 15-second black-and-white animated ad for the very first night of ITV. </p> <p>The flow of work from commercial TV provided the financial security he needed to start experimenting with his own flights of fantasy. \"I loved music hall and The Goon Show, and all my early films looked like music-hall turns. I didn't really know what I was doing. I just used to plunge in. They were simple but effective.\" </p> <p>Writer Colin Pearson, an occasional collaborator over 30 years, worked on The Do-It-Yourself Cartoon Kit (1962), as well as Great and, most recently, Millennium: The Musical. \"Bob tramples on scripts and goes off at tangents that have nothing to do with the narrative. I took my name off Great in a fit of pique.\" </p> <p>In the late 1950s, Godfrey's work came to the attention of influential film people such as Richard Lester and Joe McGrath, as well as Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine, who were working in television by then. \"We were all doing quite innovative, avant-garde things in the comedy field, so we had a lot in common. In a sense we were getting ready for the cultural gear change of the 1960s.\" </p> <p>His friendship with Lester and McGrath - he was a bit player in Help! and A Hard Day's Night, and an ideas man on Yellow Submarine - prompted Godfrey to suggest to John Lennon an animated version of his nonsense book, A Spaniard in the Works. </p> <p>\"John said he really liked the idea but I'd have to talk to Brian Epstein about the money for it. Sadly Epstein killed himself before I had a chance to see him. Anyway, John asked me to make a live action film for him and Yoko called Erection. It was about a hotel being built. He wanted to carry it around with him as a decoy to fool the customs people who always used to stop and search him for drugs.\" </p> <p>Since Henry 9 'Til 5 in 1970, about the sexual fantasies of an outwardly respectable suburban suit, Godfrey's work has always moved along parallel lines - raunchy adult material on one track, quirky kids' stuff on the other. With the highly distinctive Henry's Cat, and Roobarb and Custard, whose cat-dog relationship was inspired by the great comedy double acts, he was one of the first animators to pioneer the idea of children's cartoons with an underlying appeal to adults. \"We weren't conscious of making them sophisticated, but it's true that we thought things like Captain Pugwash and Camberwick Green were really naff.\" </p> <p>It was his second adult short, Kama Sutra Rides Again, that changed everything in 1971. Godfrey and writer Stan Hayward both felt there was comedy mileage in a cartoon Kama Sutra. He had 12 animators working on it, each one allocated a different sexual position. Among other places, coitus was achieved by Godfrey's enterprising couple, Stanley and Ethel, in a hammock, on an escalator (going up), sliding down a bannister, and on a trapeze (without a safety net). As with all his \"adult\" cartoons, Godfrey simultaneously celebrated and ridiculed mankind's preoccupation with sex. </p> <p>After it was finished, he was astonished to get a call from Stanley Kubrick saying he wanted it to accompany the UK general release of A Clockwork Orange. \"Everyone working in films knew Kubrick only ever phoned you to give you a bollocking, so when I realised he was calling to do me a favour I nearly dropped the phone.\" </p> <p>The studios Godfrey established successively in the 1960s and 1970s became focal points for wannabe creatives, including the young Terry Gilliam, who was refused work on the grounds that he was too good. \"They were full of funny, loud and desperate people who were always getting angry and walking out,\" recalls Gilliam. \"Bob turned me down many years ago and I have respected him ever since for his exquisite taste.\" </p> <p>Mike Hayes likens the working atmosphere to that of \"a circus, where you suddenly discover that the ringmaster is up on the high wire doing acrobatics\". The Guardian's Steve Bell, a sometime collaborator (The Journalist's Tale, Maggie Thatcher: Where am I Now?), describes Godfrey's work as \"deceptively simple . . . one of the things you learn working with Bob is how to avoid animation. He uses a lot of cut-outs and newsreel footage, and he's always wanting to pare everything down to the bone. He's a minimalist.\" </p> <p>Godfrey may no longer be churning out commercials, but the drive and enthusiasm are still there. Two years ago Channel 4 commissioned him to make Millennium: The Musical, a romp through 2,000 years of British history featuring jolly songs about the Black Death and Richard III. And earlier this year he produced Will's World for Channel 4, a scurrilous account of Prince William's love life, featuring, among others Britney Spears. </p> <p>Claire Kitson, his commissioning editor at Channel 4, found his approach to work unconventional. \"He makes a great pretence of being chaotic. We'd have these shambolic meetings when it would appear that nothing I'd said previously had been understood. But in fact he always delivered on time and he stuck to the schedules.\" </p> <p>As a renowned teacher of animation, Godfrey maintains his unorthodox approach. Stick to the impossible, he tells his students. Once you've learnt the rules, break them. \"I teach the basics of animation, then it's up to the individual. Great illustrators don't always make great animators. I've known people who couldn't draw at all who were great animators. You can always spot the ones with real talent. They don't listen to you.\" </p> <p>New technology has transformed the art of animation in recent years and, despite his age, Bob Godfrey refuses to languish in technophobic limbo. \"I'm not what you'd call computer literate but I employ people who are. I'm not a stuckist. All the arduous stuff has gone thanks to computers. They've revolutionised the industry.

      "bodyText": "Bob Godfrey looks as if he's been assembled by a cartoonist. Big nose, sticky-out ears, scrubby beard, hangdog expression. The thought crosses your mind that the godfather of British animation may well have invented himself. At 80, Godfrey is still hard at it in his cramped, chaotic studio in King's Cross, London, hunched over a desk, busily turning dignity on its head and subverting conventions. He is currently working on a five-minute cartoon series called Kevin Saves the World, based on a children's book by Danny Postgate about a boy who befriends a Martian. The walls are lined with cartoons, film posters and artwork stretching back half a century. As you mount the narrow stairs of the three-storey building, you're greeted by Godfrey's gallery of grotesques, the main purpose of which, he tells me, is to save him having to decorate. A proudly displayed Oscar and three Baftas look more than a little incongruous among the dog-eared pin-ups and creative detritus of his tiny command module. Looming over these gleaming awards, on the shelf above, is a stuffed arctic fox with a permanent snarl. \"Somebody from Norway sent it to me, Christ knows why,\" he chuckles. The Oscar was for Great, an animated musical about Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1975, when he became the first British animator to receive one. The story of how he came to win it is a nice mixture of enterprise and serendipity. \"I was showing my films to some students in Leicester Square, and an American guy came up to me and asked me how much I wanted for Kama Sutra Rides Again (1971), an earlier cartoon of mine. He said he liked it so much he wanted to give it to his son as a wedding present. I had a rough old 16mm print so I sold it to him for \u00a3150. I didn't give it another thought until I heard I'd been nominated for an Oscar for Kama Sutra, which came as a complete surprise since, so far as I knew, it had never been distributed in the States. \"If I could get an Oscar nomination without even trying, why didn't I put my mind to it? I'd been reading a book about Brunel so I asked British Lion, who backed Kama Sutra, if I could have some money to make a half-hour cartoon about a Victorian engineer. Yes, they said, here's \u00a320,000. They thought the sun shone out of my arse at the time. They'd have given me money to animate a toilet if I'd asked them.\" No doubt the top brass at British Lion trusted Godfrey to keep within his budget and bring in a film that marginalised engineering in favour of sex, politics and cheap laughs. Bob Godfrey started out as a graphic artist for Lever Brothers in the 1930s, advertising \"soap and sausages\", before joining a Rank subsidiary that was trying to copy the success of Walt Disney. They called it Animaland. He got his lucky break in 1950 when he was taken on by the innovative Larkin Studio, which was trying to combine the American comic strip with modern art. \"They asked me what I knew about making animated films and I said 'Nothing,' and they said, 'Good, you can start Monday.' Everything was very compartmentalised then, so I just did backgrounds. I didn't like it when I saw the finished films with all these characters moving about in front of my beautiful backgrounds.\" He decided to have a go at making his own films instead. He bought a handle-turned camera for \u00a32 in Edgware Road, rigged it up on a stand, and positioned a few tin cans to light up the artwork. \"It felt like I was discovering film 50 years after everyone else. I'd rush down to the developers with 27 feet of film. I was so thrilled when it came back in focus.\" By the time commercial TV started in 1955, Godfrey had set up his own studio in Soho - Biographic - with two other artist-animators, and managed to produce a 15-second black-and-white animated ad for the very first night of ITV. The flow of work from commercial TV provided the financial security he needed to start experimenting with his own flights of fantasy. \"I loved music hall and The Goon Show, and all my early films looked like music-hall turns. I didn't really know what I was doing. I just used to plunge in. They were simple but effective.\" Writer Colin Pearson, an occasional collaborator over 30 years, worked on The Do-It-Yourself Cartoon Kit (1962), as well as Great and, most recently, Millennium: The Musical. \"Bob tramples on scripts and goes off at tangents that have nothing to do with the narrative. I took my name off Great in a fit of pique.\" In the late 1950s, Godfrey's work came to the attention of influential film people such as Richard Lester and Joe McGrath, as well as Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine, who were working in television by then. \"We were all doing quite innovative, avant-garde things in the comedy field, so we had a lot in common. In a sense we were getting ready for the cultural gear change of the 1960s.\" His friendship with Lester and McGrath - he was a bit player in Help! and A Hard Day's Night, and an ideas man on Yellow Submarine - prompted Godfrey to suggest to John Lennon an animated version of his nonsense book, A Spaniard in the Works. \"John said he really liked the idea but I'd have to talk to Brian Epstein about the money for it. Sadly Epstein killed himself before I had a chance to see him. Anyway, John asked me to make a live action film for him and Yoko called Erection. It was about a hotel being built. He wanted to carry it around with him as a decoy to fool the customs people who always used to stop and search him for drugs.\" Since Henry 9 'Til 5 in 1970, about the sexual fantasies of an outwardly respectable suburban suit, Godfrey's work has always moved along parallel lines - raunchy adult material on one track, quirky kids' stuff on the other. With the highly distinctive Henry's Cat, and Roobarb and Custard, whose cat-dog relationship was inspired by the great comedy double acts, he was one of the first animators to pioneer the idea of children's cartoons with an underlying appeal to adults. \"We weren't conscious of making them sophisticated, but it's true that we thought things like Captain Pugwash and Camberwick Green were really naff.\" It was his second adult short, Kama Sutra Rides Again, that changed everything in 1971. Godfrey and writer Stan Hayward both felt there was comedy mileage in a cartoon Kama Sutra. He had 12 animators working on it, each one allocated a different sexual position. Among other places, coitus was achieved by Godfrey's enterprising couple, Stanley and Ethel, in a hammock, on an escalator (going up), sliding down a bannister, and on a trapeze (without a safety net). As with all his \"adult\" cartoons, Godfrey simultaneously celebrated and ridiculed mankind's preoccupation with sex. After it was finished, he was astonished to get a call from Stanley Kubrick saying he wanted it to accompany the UK general release of A Clockwork Orange. \"Everyone working in films knew Kubrick only ever phoned you to give you a bollocking, so when I realised he was calling to do me a favour I nearly dropped the phone.\" The studios Godfrey established successively in the 1960s and 1970s became focal points for wannabe creatives, including the young Terry Gilliam, who was refused work on the grounds that he was too good. \"They were full of funny, loud and desperate people who were always getting angry and walking out,\" recalls Gilliam. \"Bob turned me down many years ago and I have respected him ever since for his exquisite taste.\" Mike Hayes likens the working atmosphere to that of \"a circus, where you suddenly discover that the ringmaster is up on the high wire doing acrobatics\". The Guardian's Steve Bell, a sometime collaborator (The Journalist's Tale, Maggie Thatcher: Where am I Now?), describes Godfrey's work as \"deceptively simple . . . one of the things you learn working with Bob is how to avoid animation. He uses a lot of cut-outs and newsreel footage, and he's always wanting to pare everything down to the bone. He's a minimalist.\" Godfrey may no longer be churning out commercials, but the drive and enthusiasm are still there. Two years ago Channel 4 commissioned him to make Millennium: The Musical, a romp through 2,000 years of British history featuring jolly songs about the Black Death and Richard III. And earlier this year he produced Will's World for Channel 4, a scurrilous account of Prince William's love life, featuring, among others Britney Spears. Claire Kitson, his commissioning editor at Channel 4, found his approach to work unconventional. \"He makes a great pretence of being chaotic. We'd have these shambolic meetings when it would appear that nothing I'd said previously had been understood. But in fact he always delivered on time and he stuck to the schedules.\" As a renowned teacher of animation, Godfrey maintains his unorthodox approach. Stick to the impossible, he tells his students. Once you've learnt the rules, break them. \"I teach the basics of animation, then it's up to the individual. Great illustrators don't always make great animators. I've known people who couldn't draw at all who were great animators. You can always spot the ones with real talent. They don't listen to you.\" New technology has transformed the art of animation in recent years and, despite his age, Bob Godfrey refuses to languish in technophobic limbo. \"I'm not what you'd call computer literate but I employ people who are. I'm not a stuckist. All the arduous stuff has gone thanks to computers. They've revolutionised the industry. The strange thing is that my computerised films look like my old trace-and- paint films.\" Looking back over 60 years of animation, does he have any regrets? \"I'd love to have done a full-length feature but I can't seem to stretch myself to that length. When you look at my films, they appear to be a series of 30-second commercials cut together. I'm a short distance man whether I like it or not.\" Bob Godfrey presents programmes of his animated shorts at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (0207-928 3232), on April 26 and 28.",

(The script refers to the real Clinton's impeachment, so the film is presumably set around 2007 or 2008; writer-director Rod Lurie clearly conceived his movie at a time when a Democratic successor to Clinton was considered a shoo-in.)

Instead of denying the stories, she refuses to dignify this filth with a response - and all the president's men look like leaving her to twist in the wind. </p> <p>Lurie's film is watchable enough, with kangaroo-court witch trial scenes that owe a good deal to John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate. There's a top-notch performance from Allen, and Bridges is great as the president who visibly adores charming, intimidating and discomfiting people with the trappings of office: particularly in one scene in which he meets an idealistic young congressman, played by Christian Slater, and insists he shares some of his (symbolic) lunch - shark-steak sandwich. </p> <p>But this isn't a tough, wised-up political thriller; this is a movie puffed up with chest-busting sentimental pride at its own heroic liberalism. It actually has some extremely quaint and conservative assumptions about modern sexual politics. Moreover, its key plot denouement is the silliest cop-out I have seen in years. It is so lame that I at first thought it was a devilishly cynical fabrication to be itself unmasked in some post-credit twist. </p> <p>But no. The Contender is a movie in which we are invited to applaud, as a feminist breakthrough, a powerful man being so good as to give a woman a job: the vice-presidency. She is not shown earning this job at the ballot-box, still less on the basis of winning anything so boring as a political argument. And in the political landscape shown here, Joan Allen is weirdly the only important woman.

Well, yes, she (and we) certainly crawled to Ron very humiliatingly indeed.

The wife, housekeeper, mistress and self-proclaimed illegitimate daughter of the late Carlo De Carlo were locked in battle for an estate said to be priceless. Some of the most valuable works, including two 14th-century paintings by Giotto, were missing from the lots due to be sold in Florence. What remained was expected to raise more than \u00a310m. Mr De Carlo's collection has tainted establishment figures since his unexpected death from a stroke in August 1999, aged 68. A Florentine businessman and art dealer, who kept some of the best pieces for himself, he left no will. Giotto portraits of St John the Baptist and St Francis, worth more than \u00a313m, are reported to have vanished from a bank vault the day after his death. A holy water container embossed with the seal of Pope Clement VII and a panel from a 15th-century polyptych by Lorenzo Monaco also disappeared. Police traced other missing treasures to the dealer's employees and friends. Among those charged with theft were his mistress, Mara Masini; their alleged daughter Lisa Zecchi and her husband. Mr De Carlo's housekeeper and her son were also charged. Leonardo Mondadori, the chairman of Italy's biggest publishing house, was charged with receiving stolen goods after nine works were found and confiscated at his home. Mr Mondadori said he arranged to buy them from the dealer before he died and completed the transaction with Mrs Zecchi, who he assumed was a legal heir. A member of the board of Sotheby's Italia, he told Italy Daily he would not participate in last night's auction: \"I wouldn't dream of it, so much dust has been raised over these works that I prefer to remain out of everything.\" De Carlo's brother and widow, from whom he was estranged for 15 years, took possession of the remaining works and decided to auction them. Florentine museums were dismayed; they had expected a will to make generous donations. As compensation they were given a 16th-century bust of Christ by Tullio Lombardo and a painting of the Virgin enthroned with saints by Duccio di Buoninsegna. Antonio Paolucci, Florence's supervisor for fine arts, was accused of intentionally inflating the auction's prices by exhibiting 38 works at the Galleria dell'Accademia. \"It creates an instant pedigree for the works which are no longer just the property of a dealer but objects that have been shown in a museum setting,\" the art critic Paolo Vagheggi told Italy Daily.

As I type this entry I am wearing two jumpers: the office is far from warm and chilly draughts howl under the door.</p> <p>The trees remain stubbornly leafless and the grass in the pastures is still sparse, but not everywhere is like this. In County Durham around Tow Law, and for mile upon mile along the A68, there is hardly a sheep to be seen and it is easy for passers by to recognise this fact because the empty fields stand out as vibrant squares of shocking green. The Eden valley in Cumbria is almost completely without livestock, and I am told by those who have done the drive from Hartside to Penrith (and beyond) that passing through this eerie scene - of an empty, utterly silent landscape - is a truly shocking experience.</p> <p>Yesterday our census form arrived in the post, and so did further instruction from Northumberland county council about footpath closures. New guidelines have been issued and in some areas footpaths will re-open, but only under a strict code of conduct. Footpaths across non-agricultural land, woodland, arable and set-aside will re-open, but footpaths will remain closed within 3km of infected premises, within all premises under foot and mouth restrictions, and elsewhere where rights of way cross areas grazed by livestock.</p> <p>The code of practice for everyone wanting to use the re-opened paths seems to be quite sensible. Anyone who keeps or handles livestock must not cross any farmland at all. All visitors to the countryside must comply with the notices that are displayed. And they are asked to keep dogs on a lead (at all times) and not to take dogs on to land with cows, sheep, goats or pigs. Everyone is asked to use disinfectant where provided and never to leave behind waste food or litter and to clean their boots and their vehicles after each walk or visit to the countryside.</p> <p>The sheep are hungry all the time now, and it is not a good sign. Every time the quad bike enters the field they lift their heads expectantly and some even come running up, whatever the time of day, in the hope that they will be fed with compound food at the trough or receive more hay. Although this is not uncommon with a late spring, it is rather dispiriting this year as we do not know what the future holds and all this extra feed is very expensive. Archie, our lambing shepherd, said an inch of grass in the fields would make all the difference, and we all agree.</p> <p>This shortage of new grass and the consequential shortage of milk among the ewes is leading to problems in the twin fields. Every evening Peter and Graham check different fields of ewes with twin lambs to make sure that each pair of lambs is \"mothered up\" with its own mother. Because the ewes are so ravenous they are rushing up to the troughs and leaving their lambs behind so it is impossible to make sure each family unit is safe for the night.</p> <p>This is an added worry as the cold nights are always a risk for abandoned and hungry lambs and we do also have predators. A strong recently born Cheviot cross lamb was found on Wednesday morning with its head bitten off by either a fox or a badger, and the crowds of crows often peck out the eye or even a tongue of a lamb if it is left alone.</p> <p>Another cow calved on Tuesday night, during a brief but fierce snowstorm. This particular cow was thankfully beside the back door into the shed so it was easy to bring them both into the warm and dry. We have had six live calves so far this spring, and there are hopefully a few more due soon.</p> <p>Only 19 Mule sheep are left to lamb but there are still too many Scottish Blackface ewes left to count, but by next week there should be a lot fewer. We are well over half way through the lambing, but we're not quite able to see the end of the interminable lambing tunnel where work is the only order of the day and a few hours off is an unobtainable luxury.</p> <p>At least we have no pet lambs - yet. Melanie, Roly's wife, from the next door farm, has 16 lambs on the bottle receiving powdered milk and she also has 25 or more on an automatic milk feeder. All these hassles are the normal trials and tribulations of spring, of course. And at least we still have our livestock to worry about.</p> <p>\u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

Nine-month-old sisters Belinda and Kimberley had arrived in Britain in January after being \"bought\" by Alan and Judith Kilshaw, from north Wales, through an internet site run by a Californian child broker. The case provoked outrage when the Kilshaws' claim to have adopted the girls in the US was contested by a Californian couple, who paid the broker first, and by the twins' natural mother, Tranda Wecker.

      "bodyText": "The Bush administration, reversing efforts to extricate itself from the Middle East, is poised to appoint a peace envoy to the region, US and Israeli officials said yesterday. A likely candidate is Edward Djerjian, a veteran diplomat who has served as ambassador to Israel and Syria. Richard Haas, a former analyst at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, has also been mentioned. But it is thought that whoever is appointed will not have the sweeping independence or the staff of Dennis Ross, who was a significant player in peacemaking for the best part of 10 years. The appointment is the latest in a series of events which suggest that Washington, concerned about the growing violence of the Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation, may have given up its goal of disengaging from day-to-day involvement in the Middle East, because of the gravity of the crisis. Earlier this month the CIA held a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian security officials near Tel Aviv, reversing the agency's decision to end its mediatory role. Reports of an imminent appointment surfaced less than 48 hours after Washington made an unexpected intervention in the uprising by rebuking Israel for re-occupying a square mile of the Gaza Strip. Within hours of it condemning the seizure of Palestinian-ruled land as \"excessive and disproportionate\", Israeli tanks were on their way out. The hasty withdrawal proved hugely embarrassing to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who has been forced to fend off the accusation of far-right allies that he succumbed to US pressure. The episode also led to squabbling in Israeli military and political circles, and yesterday parliament opened an investigation into the affair. Analysts said Washington's rebuke and the expected appointment of a peace envoy heralded the renewal of US involvement in the Middle East crisis which could result in it placing limits on Mr Sharon's campaign to snuff out the Palestinian revolt. Mr Sharon spoke to President George Bush during thee night. His spokesman said he told Mr Bush that Israel would continue to retaliate harshly against mortar attacks on Jewish settlements in Gaza. But after this week's rebuke it seems clear that the US will tolerate the incursions that have become routine under Mr Sharon, but not his reoccupation of Palestinian territory. \"They pretty clearly set out a line that Israel should not reoccupy parts of Palestinian Authority, that if it is going to go in, it should come out right away,\" said Joseph Alpher, an independent analyst who was an adviser to the former prime minister Ehud Barak at the failed Camp David summit last summer. The US is getting itself more involved as Mr Sharon steps up his efforts to end the revolt and thereby accelerates the cycle of attack and retaliation. In the the West Bank city of Ramallah an explosion ripped through the roof of a building used by Yasser Arafat's elite Force 17 security unit yesterday. It was unclear what caused the blast.

      "bodyText": "A three metre-high fence and thousands of police officers sealed off the heart of Quebec City last night as the leaders of 34 American countries began to arrive for a controversial free trade summit. Hundreds of women staged the first of many protests against the Summit of the Americas, which is taking place in the Canadian city this weekend, when they attached weavings and banners to the perimeter fence. Lisa Fithian of the Direct Action Network, an organising group, said that they were trying to highlight the injustice of the proceedings. Police yesterday charged seven Canadians with conspiring to commit dangerous acts and to break through the security fence. In a specially held press conference after the arrests, the police displayed weapons they had seized during the arrests, including military thunder flash explosives, smoke bombs, baseball bats, and slingshots. Clac, an anarchistic anti-capitalist group; Gomm, a coalition against globalisation; and the pagan River Action group are all expected to stage separate demonstrations today. The Canadian authorities expect a total of between 10,000 and 40,000 people to protest against the free trade agreement being discussed at the summit. The protests, which follow those held in Seattle two years ago and Washington and Prague last year, are expected to be among the largest held in Canada in recent memory. Disparate groups from across the Americas believe that the aim of the summit - to push towards the creation of a huge free trade bloc from the tip of South America to north of the Arctic Circle encompassing 800m people and with a combined output of $11 trillion in goods and services - will harm poorer countries and damage the environment. The summit has been criticised for being anti-democratic. Aides to George Bush, who will travel to the summit tomorrow, have said that members of his cabinet will meet with representatives of the anti-globalisation, environmental and human rights groups as part of the \"good neighbour\" policy the US president wants to expound at the meeting. But more than 7,000 police officers from four different Canadian forces have been trained in special anti-protest control measures in an attempt to prevent a re-run of the clashes that turned Seattle into a battleground. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police force is co-ordinating the effort, which also includes 1,400 members of the Canadian armed forces. One police officer who earned the nickname Sergeant Pepper at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit four years ago for repeatedly spraying protesters with pepper spray will also be on the frontlines. The 6ft tall chainlink fence, mounted on concrete posts, is six kilometres long (3.7 miles) and covers the downtown area of Old Quebec, enclosing summit venues and hotels. Some of the protesters believe that the heavy border controls and police presence may have deterred some potential participants. Philippe Duhamel, an organiser for Salami, a leading Canadian protest groups, said that several people had been prevented from entering Canada and many were worried by threats of police brutality: \"People are scared. They are really scared.\" Ms Fithian added that many first aiders had been prevented from entering the country by border police. \"People are only being let in if they don't identify themselves with the protest and don't have any equipment with them,\" she said. Over the weekend, when the summit proper starts with a series of meetings to discuss increasing hemispheric trade, a larger march is expected to be held and organised by labour unions in Canada. One Canadian citizen tried to have the fence taken down as an affront to democratic freedom but a superior court judge ruled that it should stand because of the risk of violence during the summit.",

      "body": "<p>Forget May Day. The anti-globalisation lobby's first big outing of the year is happening this weekend in Quebec City. Representatives of 34 nations, Antigua and Barbuda to Venezuela with the United States and Canada towering over them as the chart shows, are gathering for the third summit of the Americas, which is discussing a free trade area to cover the entire western hemisphere.</p> <p>Also expected are between 10,000 and 40,000 protesters. The Canadian authorities have built a 3m high, 5km long wall around the old quarter of the city to prevent a repeat of the demonstrations which have disrupted international financial meetings in Seattle, Washington and Prague.</p> <p>On both sides of the barricades the gatherings face major challenges. The goal of a free trade zone stretching from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn was first mooted seven years ago but lay dormant after the Clinton administration lost so called \"fast track\" negotiating authority in 1994.</p> <p>The new president has declared the Free Trade Area of the Americas to be a priority but George Bush's fellow leaders are rightly sceptical about what the United States is prepared to bring to the table. Brazil, the most powerful Latin American economy, doubts that the US will offer many concessions on market access for steel and agriculture, its two priorities.</p> <p>Also crucial will be whether the new administration can win fast-track negotiating authority from congress. Without this, which the Bush administration calls trade promotion authority, Washington's partners fear prospective deals may be rewritten by a Congress dominated by producer lobbies.</p> <p>Prospects for the global economy have darkened since the leaders made the Quebec date in their diaries. This week's decision by Alan Greenspan, the world's most powerful central banker, to cut interest rates, is an indication of how worried the authorities are.</p> <p>Trade deals are often easier to clinch when the economic outlook becomes uncertain.

      "bodyText": "Forget May Day. The anti-globalisation lobby's first big outing of the year is happening this weekend in Quebec City. Representatives of 34 nations, Antigua and Barbuda to Venezuela with the United States and Canada towering over them as the chart shows, are gathering for the third summit of the Americas, which is discussing a free trade area to cover the entire western hemisphere. Also expected are between 10,000 and 40,000 protesters. The Canadian authorities have built a 3m high, 5km long wall around the old quarter of the city to prevent a repeat of the demonstrations which have disrupted international financial meetings in Seattle, Washington and Prague. On both sides of the barricades the gatherings face major challenges. The goal of a free trade zone stretching from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn was first mooted seven years ago but lay dormant after the Clinton administration lost so called \"fast track\" negotiating authority in 1994. The new president has declared the Free Trade Area of the Americas to be a priority but George Bush's fellow leaders are rightly sceptical about what the United States is prepared to bring to the table. Brazil, the most powerful Latin American economy, doubts that the US will offer many concessions on market access for steel and agriculture, its two priorities. Also crucial will be whether the new administration can win fast-track negotiating authority from congress. Without this, which the Bush administration calls trade promotion authority, Washington's partners fear prospective deals may be rewritten by a Congress dominated by producer lobbies. Prospects for the global economy have darkened since the leaders made the Quebec date in their diaries. This week's decision by Alan Greenspan, the world's most powerful central banker, to cut interest rates, is an indication of how worried the authorities are. Trade deals are often easier to clinch when the economic outlook becomes uncertain. Negotiators' minds become concentrated on the dangers of a breakdown in trading relationships. As Mike Moore, the head of the World Trade Organisation asked recently: \"When do you fix the roof? When the sun shines or when it rains?\" But history shows that the opposite can also be true. During the depression of the 1930s, countries rushed to erect tariff walls around their economies, and exacerbated the downturn with beggar-thy-neighbour devaluations. In an uncomfortable reminder of that past, Argentina, the most storm-tossed economy in the Americas, has recently slapped higher tariffs on range of imports, in defiance of its obligations under Mercosur, the four-country Latin American trade agreement. Argentina also angered its neighbour Brazil by signalling it may break ranks with the rest of Mercosur and negotiate bilateral trade agreements with the European Union and the US.

It would severely dent Mercosur's status as a customs union with a common external tariff.

      "bodyText": "The collapse of the drug companies' court case against the South African government is likely to be just the first victory in the battle for cheaper medicines in developing countries. Although the spotlight is on Pretoria, which has not yet shown any inclination to use the Aids drugs which it can now legally obtain at lower prices, a second legal front has already been opened in Brazil, a country hailed as a shining example of Aids treatment in the developing world. It is richer than South Africa and has 500,000 fewer HIV-positive patients, but that does not diminish its achievement in distributing life-saving anti-retroviral drugs to the vast majority of patients who need them. It has done so by making cheap generic copies of some drugs and buying others from generic manufacturers in India. Since 1996, when it began to provide free anti-retroviral drugs, it has halved the Aids death rate and reduced the number confined to hospital by 80%. But now Brazil is coming under serious attack. Washington, at the behest of the pharmaceuticals companies, is taking it to a disciplinary tribunal of the World Trade Organisation. It alleges that Brazil is in breach of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) agreement, which enshrines patent protection for 20 years. If Brazil loses the case it will be forced to change its laws or face trade sanctions. Brazil has made or imported 10 types of drugs quite legally, because they were patented before Brazil's Trips-compliant law came into force in 1997. Its battle is for drug patented since then. The action lodged by the US at the WTO in January takes issue with Article 68 of Brazil's 1996 Industrial Property Act, which says it can legally make or import a generic version of a drug if the patent-holding company fails to manufacture it in Brazil - local production making it cheaper - within three years. The clause has not yet been used. Campaigners say that the companies and their allies are picking a fight with local legislation to intimidate developing countries into buying medicines at prices set by the big companies. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser to Oxfam, said: \"It is part of the systematic intimidation of Brazil and developing countries to say if you step out of what we define as the line on intellectual property, we will clobber you in the courts.\" Developing countries are supposed to endorse Trips by 2005, and Oxfam sees the Brazilian case as a clear signal to Argentina and India, both of which make generic drugs and are preparing their own Trips-compliant law. Brazil recently won a battle with Merck, manufacturers of efavirenz, one of the two patented drugs on which Brazil spends a third of its Aids drugs budget. The state pharmaceutical company imported efavirenz made in India, saying it wanted to research the possibility of making its own copy. Merck threatened legal action, but it has now reduced the price of its brand of efavirenz, Stocrin, by more than half. Brazil is trying the same tactics on Roche, producers of the second drug, nelfinavir. Despite the publicity disaster in Pretoria, the US will be reluctant to withdraw its case against Brazil. The biggest nightmare for the pharmaceutical industry is the possibility that cheap generic versions of their new drugs may end up in the US.

He is no longer an MK. He stood down shortly after being made minister for justice in the last parliament. At the time of the Oslo agreement he was deputy foreign minister and, although not officially part of the Israeli delegation, is seen as one of the chief architects of the deal. \u0095 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

      "body": "<p>At least one person has cause to be grateful for foot and mouth. Sir Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, has higher meat prices to thank for saving him the embarrassment of writing a letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation has drastically undershot the government's target. </p> <p>Underlying inflation was unchanged in March at 1.9% - marking two years now that it has been below the Bank's 2.5% target. Gordon Brown set the Bank a particular challenge by keeping excise duty on fuel on hold in his March budget. Because in previous years the fuel escalator has raised duties faster than inflation, the impact of no change this time around would have been to push inflation down by around 0.3 percentage points - taking it perilously close to the 1.5% threshold which requires Sir Eddie to sharpen his quill pen. </p> <p>Instead, foot and mouth intervened, sending meat prices soaring and cancelling out the disinflationary impact of Mr Brown's budget. </p> <p>Next month, however, will be a different story. Further budget measures are likely to knock a further 0.4 percentage points off the underlying rate and could require Sir Eddie to start composing his letter. He will undoubtedly tell Mr Brown what he told MPs last month - that the Bank, like other forecasters, has been wrong-footed by sterling's unexpected strength. This has kept inflation in check, at the expense of squeezing the export sector. </p> <p>Influenced by the arrival of Sushil Wadhwani on to the monetary policy committee, the Bank has reformed its forecasting model to take a more realistic view about the direction of the exchange rate. This has contributed to the MPC's decision to cut rates twice since January. After its most recent meeting, the Bank left the door open for further moves. Sooner rather than later might be advisable. </p> <p>If they cut in May, Sir Eddie could then point to that rate cut as evidence of what the Bank is doing to raise inflation. If they choose to delay - the following month's meeting coincides with the expected date of the general election - and a cut on that day could be interpreted as politically driven. Threadneedle Street may be officially above the political process, but discretion is the better part of being a central banker. </p> <p><strong> Merger relief </strong><br> </p> <p>The idea of the merger of the Brambles/GKN industrial services businesses has been around for so long that there was a sense of relief when the deal was finally done. Certainly it looks a sensible solution and will allow GKN to concentrate on its engineering operations with a strong balance sheet. Nevertheless, there are questions that shareholders will want to ponder. The divestment of industrial services increases GKN's dependence on automotives at a time when the industry in the US is not having an easy time. Then there is the question of whether the group can hang on to its membership of the FTSE-100. In these days of tracker funds, size matters. </p> <p>From the Bramble side the acquisition of GKN's chief executive and finance director means that it is getting people who know the business without the risk of top management turf wars which often bedevil post-merger companies. </p> <p>GKN is promoting from within to fill the gaps and sensibly opting for continuity - but its new top team will be under few illusions about the need to impress. </p> <p><strong> Scare tactics </strong><br> </p> <p>The Institute of Directors yesterday produced a piece of research suggesting the cost of the foot and mouth outbreak could have already reached \u00a320bn (or 2% of GDP). By the end of July, it added, that figure could be \u00a340bn. </p> <p>These are sky-high numbers designed to generate scary headlines. The survey was conducted on the internet. Some 600 members replied, saying they had suffered an average loss of \u00a350,000 so far, which could be \u00a3125,000 by the end of July. </p> <p>The IoD's number crunchers, led by economist Ruth Lea, grossed up the numbers to produce findings for the whole economy and to wheel out its usual demands for compensation, tax rebates, interest free loans etc. </p> <p>But this research is so badly flawed it should never have been released. The businesses which replied - mostly in hotels, catering, and transport and distribution - were concentrated in areas hit hardest by the outbreak. The losses they anticipate were their own estimates and could be wildly exaggerated. The IoD admits its numbers are \"crude grossed-up estimates\" and that the real cost is probably only a quarter of its suggestions. </p> <p>Many businesses other than farming are being badly hit by the outbreak, but the IoD's tactic of generating scary numbers from what they admit is a self-selecting sample to back their financial demands is at best misleading, at worst dishonest and ultimately self-defeating. </p> <p><strong>Email update</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><strong>More on the

      "bodyText": "At least one person has cause to be grateful for foot and mouth. Sir Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, has higher meat prices to thank for saving him the embarrassment of writing a letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation has drastically undershot the government's target. Underlying inflation was unchanged in March at 1.9% - marking two years now that it has been below the Bank's 2.5% target. Gordon Brown set the Bank a particular challenge by keeping excise duty on fuel on hold in his March budget. Because in previous years the fuel escalator has raised duties faster than inflation, the impact of no change this time around would have been to push inflation down by around 0.3 percentage points - taking it perilously close to the 1.5% threshold which requires Sir Eddie to sharpen his quill pen. Instead, foot and mouth intervened, sending meat prices soaring and cancelling out the disinflationary impact of Mr Brown's budget. Next month, however, will be a different story. Further budget measures are likely to knock a further 0.4 percentage points off the underlying rate and could require Sir Eddie to start composing his letter. He will undoubtedly tell Mr Brown what he told MPs last month - that the Bank, like other forecasters, has been wrong-footed by sterling's unexpected strength. This has kept inflation in check, at the expense of squeezing the export sector. Influenced by the arrival of Sushil Wadhwani on to the monetary policy committee, the Bank has reformed its forecasting model to take a more realistic view about the direction of the exchange rate. This has contributed to the MPC's decision to cut rates twice since January. After its most recent meeting, the Bank left the door open for further moves. Sooner rather than later might be advisable. If they cut in May, Sir Eddie could then point to that rate cut as evidence of what the Bank is doing to raise inflation. If they choose to delay - the following month's meeting coincides with the expected date of the general election - and a cut on that day could be interpreted as politically driven. Threadneedle Street may be officially above the political process, but discretion is the better part of being a central banker. Merger relief The idea of the merger of the Brambles/GKN industrial services businesses has been around for so long that there was a sense of relief when the deal was finally done. Certainly it looks a sensible solution and will allow GKN to concentrate on its engineering operations with a strong balance sheet. Nevertheless, there are questions that shareholders will want to ponder. The divestment of industrial services increases GKN's dependence on automotives at a time when the industry in the US is not having an easy time. Then there is the question of whether the group can hang on to its membership of the FTSE-100. In these days of tracker funds, size matters. From the Bramble side the acquisition of GKN's chief executive and finance director means that it is getting people who know the business without the risk of top management turf wars which often bedevil post-merger companies. GKN is promoting from within to fill the gaps and sensibly opting for continuity - but its new top team will be under few illusions about the need to impress. Scare tactics The Institute of Directors yesterday produced a piece of research suggesting the cost of the foot and mouth outbreak could have already reached \u00a320bn (or 2% of GDP). By the end of July, it added, that figure could be \u00a340bn. These are sky-high numbers designed to generate scary headlines. The survey was conducted on the internet. Some 600 members replied, saying they had suffered an average loss of \u00a350,000 so far, which could be \u00a3125,000 by the end of July. The IoD's number crunchers, led by economist Ruth Lea, grossed up the numbers to produce findings for the whole economy and to wheel out its usual demands for compensation, tax rebates, interest free loans etc. But this research is so badly flawed it should never have been released. The businesses which replied - mostly in hotels, catering, and transport and distribution - were concentrated in areas hit hardest by the outbreak. The losses they anticipate were their own estimates and could be wildly exaggerated. The IoD admits its numbers are \"crude grossed-up estimates\" and that the real cost is probably only a quarter of its suggestions. Many businesses other than farming are being badly hit by the outbreak, but the IoD's tactic of generating scary numbers from what they admit is a self-selecting sample to back their financial demands is at best misleading, at worst dishonest and ultimately self-defeating.

      "bodyText": "Accenture, the management consultancy firm formerly known as Andersen Consulting, is to press ahead with a flotation of its shares despite the rocky stock market conditions. The decision will release millions of pounds for the 2,500 partners of the firm, including chief executive Joe Forehand and Ian Watmore, the managing partner in Britain, following last year's acrimonious split from Arthur Andersen. However, under the terms of the planned share sale announced in the United States yesterday, the partners will be locked into the firm for at least eight years and they will not be able to sell more than 10% of the shares within the first year of the flotation. The timing of the shares sale in the United States is not clear but the partners reached an agreement at a meeting held late on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas, to press ahead with the flotation. Like other partnerships to list shares on the stock market, such as the investment bank Goldman Sachs, Accenture will have to endure closer public scrutiny of its finances. Accenture is expected to sell shares worth around 10% of the overall value of the group, according to the documentation filed with US regulator the securities and exchange commission yesterday. The filing shows that Accenture expects to raise up to $1bn (\u00a3700m) in an initial public offering which was expected to take place in June, before the emergence of widespread speculation recently that the partners had decided to abandon their plans. In deciding to change from their partnership status, the Accenture partners are following a route taken by the consultancy arms of other firms such as KPMG. There had been speculation that Accenture might delay its float not only because of the stock market conditions but also because of the more difficult economic backdrop. However, Accenture said yesterday that, while it expected to made a loss in the coming three months, its revenues were growing.",

The comment is in one sense progressive: until now, LDP politicians would not have dreamed of suggesting that Japan should be for anyone but the Japanese. But his singling out of the wealthy members of one particular group does nothing to change the impression that many Japanese leaders are guilty of racial stereotyping and averse to accepting needy immigrants. Japan has accepted fewer than 10 economic refugees in the past decade. Mr Aso, a rising LDP star related to the imperial family, said the presence of rich Jews was a benchmark of success, because they were attracted to countries that were free of racial discrimination and had good law and order, low taxes and a strong national defence.",

      "bodyText": "President Abdurrahman Wahid warned Indonesian MPs yesterday that he had 400,000 supporters ready to descend on the capital, Jakarta, if they went ahead with their attempt to impeach him. He told a conference of business people, analysts and diplomats: \"You can see that it is a nationwide rebellion against the ways of the parliament, which is doing its worst now. \"My supporters ... are going to Jakarta. Yesterday the registration came to 400,000, from all over Java and from Lampung, Sumatra. \"This does not take into account the people from Jakarta.\" The parliament, in which only 11% of MPs supportthe president, is expected to give him a second and final warning to mend his ways when it meets in 10 days time. If the majority of MPs remain dissatisfied with his response to their demand for more effective government, they are entitled to begin impeachment proceedings after 30 days. Mr Wahid, who became Indonesia's first democratically elected president in October 1999, accuses parliament of acting unconstitutionally and illegally by trying to remove him, because it did not bring the required treason charges. \"According to the constitution, the president has the right to govern to the end of his term [in such circumstances],\" he said. His five-year term ends in 2004. While there is no evidence to corroborate Mr Wahid's claim that an army of supporters is about to descend on the capital, tens of thousands of people have joined a new movement called the Defenders of Truth Front (FPK), whose only criterion for membership is a willingness to martyr oneself to defend Mr Wahid as president. \"We exceeded all the membership targets we have set,\" the FPK's founder, Wiro Sugiman, said. \"This is a clear sign that the majority of people do not support the campaign to get rid of [Wahid].\" Mr Sugiman says the FPK is not about defending the president, rather it was formed to protect the constitution. \"We are ready to defend the truth, the rightful president, the constitution, to guard the nation and the state, if necessary until blood is spilled.\" But it is no coincidence that the movement was set up a month ago in the heartland of Mr Wahid's support, East Java, just as his position was beginning to get precarious. He is regarded there as an almost mythical sacred man who can do no wrong, owing to his position as a former leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, the world's biggest Muslim organisation, which has its base in the region. In recent weeks the FPK has been giving some of its members paramilitary training and guidance on strengthening their spirit. \"If the spirit is strong enough, then the body can do anything,\" Mr Sugiman said. Observers are divided about the seriousness of the threat posed by groups such as the FPK. One diplomat at the conference described Mr Wahid as being \"disingenuous in believing that he can get away with using force to save himself\". Another in the audience disagreed. \"Wahid is such a master tactician, and the opposition are so confused about how to deliver the killer blow, he could well survive.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Italian government has cut through 2,000 years of yearning and dithering with an election promise to link Sicily to the mainland. A road and rail suspension bridge will be built across the Strait of Messina if the private sector agrees to pay half the \u00a33bn cost, it said. Work could begin within months on a project which has beguiled nationalists, mobsters and ancient Roman engineers. Decreed a national priority 30 years ago, the project has been given the go-ahead by ministers desperate to woo the voters before next month's general election. The design is for a bridge carrying 12 lanes of traffic on a 3,690-metre span connecting the toe of Italy to the north-east tip of Sicily's Up to 140,000 cars and 200 trains could be carried daily. Opposition politicians mocked the promise as yet another false dawn in a saga which has inspired a Sicilian expression for procrastination: \"When they build the bridge.\" But Nino Calarco, who has chaired a public sector company charged with supervising the project since the early 1970s, and has been likened to the characters in Beckett's Waiting for Godot, sensed that his wait was at an end. \"The bridge will become a reality,\" he said. Agazio Loiero, the minister for regional affairs, was confident that matching private capital would be found. \"We'll know soon if the bridge will be able to be realised. The state is willing to cover 50% of the cost as long as there are private investors who commit themselves to an identical cost,\" he said. The centre-left government needs to galvanise support in the south to avoid defeat in the general election on May 13. Despite cynicism, Sicilians and Calabrians are enthusiastic about the jobs and wealth which could be generated by linking two of Italy's poorest regions. Successive governments, fearing a financial and engineering fiasco, delayed a decision by commissioning one feasibility study after another. Greens and some economists said that the 11-year construction project would damage the environment and divert resources from plugging gaps in the motorway and railway network. Greens in the government derided the announcement as a pseudo-decision typical of Pontius Pilate. The centre-right dismissed it as empty propaganda intended to steal thunder from its own promise of massive infrastructure investment. Whether a government formed by the present opposition would go ahead with the bridge was unclear. Ancient Romans dreamed of bridging the strait, which was known in Greek mythology as Scylla and Charybdis, after the six-headed monster and whirlpool reputed to lie in wait for sailors on the opposite sides. Giuseppe Garibaldi's nation alists considered building a bridge in 1860 to consolidate their unification of Italy. In yesterday's La Repubblica, Andrea Camilleri, one of Sicily's best-known novelists, attacked those who sought to preserve the \"sacredness\" of the water between the island and Italy. \"Finally we will succeed in eliminating this ... sense of isolation and loneliness,\" he said. One source of government hesitation has been the fear that the mafia will infiltrate the process of letting construction contracts. The bridge would unite Sicily's Cosa Nostra with Calabria's 'Ndrangheta', the Scylla and Charybdis of organised crime networks, specialists in skimming the profit off public work contracts.",

      "bodyText": "US-Egyptian relations cooled again yesterday after American investigators concluded that mechanical problems were not responsible for the crash of EgyptAir flight 990 two years ago. The official draft finding of the national transportation safety board (NTSB) once again pointed the finger of responsibility at one of the co-pilots, Gameel el-Batouti. There was outrage in Egypt when it was suggested shortly after the crash in October 1999 that Batouti had put the plane into a dive to kill himself. All 217 people on board the Boeing-767 were killed when the plane, which was flying from New York to Cairo, plunged from 10,000 metres into the Atlantic. The report was due to be presented to the Egyptian authorities yesterday. It is understood not to use the word \"suicide\", partly because there is no clue to why the pilot might have forced the plane into a fatal dive, and partly because earlier suggestions that Batouti was responsible caused such indignation in Egypt, a key American ally. EgyptAir 990 had not reported any technical problems before its autopilot suddenly shut off, its throttles cut back and its elevators initiated a steep descent. The plane recovered, rose, and then fell again into the ocean. A year ago the NTSB released transcripts from the flight's black box recorder in which Batouti is heard repeatedly saying: \"I rely on God.\" The voice of the captain then says: \"What's happening, Gameel, what's happening?\" \"What is this? What is this? Did you shut the engine?\" EgyptAir has 60 days to prepare a response to the draft report before a final set of conclusions are issued. The airline and the Egyptian government aggressively rebuff the claim that Batouti caused the disaster. A statement issued earlier this week by the airline called on the Americans to make fresh tests of the 767's flight control system. It urged US aviation and safety authorities to \"consider the possibility that there might be an inherent flaw in the design and/or maintenance procedures of the Boeing 767 flight control system\". Central to the Egyptian's case is the experience of an American Airlines 767-300 which experienced problems with its flight controls while landing at Paris on March 27. The plane lost altitude and experienced \"pitch control difficulties\" which were not caused by the pilots as it tried to land. EgyptAir cited two previous incidents, in Bahrain and Mexico, in which rivets in the flight control system was found to have been damaged. Walid Batouti, a spokesman for the co-pilot's family, said NTSB officials \"were not cooperative with the Egyptian investigators and continue to refuse to hand them important information ... [which] would confirm the mechanical failure theory or the assumption that the plane might have been hit by missile after it was mistakenly guided in to a restricted military air zone\".

      "bodyText": "French authorities yesterday began formal extradition proceedings against Francisco Arce Montez, the Spaniard held in a US jail who is suspected of raping and murdering the British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson in a Brittany youth hostel five years ago. A spokesman for Rennes appeal court in northern France said an international arrest warrant, pending a request for extradition from the French justice ministry, had been sent to the American authorities yesterday. He added that the paperwork included an English translation of the Paris police laboratory report that found 18 matches between the suspect's DNA and traces found on 13-year-old Caroline's body after she was raped and suffocated in Pleine-Foug\u00e8res hostel in July 1996. Since his arrest in Miami, French police have learned that that Arce Montez, an itinerant restaurant and bar worker, had been convicted or was suspected of a variety of sex offences in Germany, France and Spain over a 20-year period starting in 1980. He may also be linked to unsolved offences in Britain, where he lived from 1994 to 1996, and the Netherlands. The bungled French investigation eventually led to DNA tests being performed on some 3,600 men, and a former girlfriend of the suspect has confirmed to police that he was staying with her at her home some 30 miles from Pleine-Foug\u00e8res at the time of Caroline's murder. When Arce Montez, 51, might appear in a French courtroom will depend on whether the US authorities opt for an accelerated extradition procedure. He is due to be tried in Miami on July 2 after his arrest on March 3 for breaking into the room of a young woman while she was asleep and cutting her underwear with scissors. Before extradition, under the standard procedure Arce Montez would first have to stand trial on charges of breaking and entering and lewd behaviour. If France asks for an accelerated procedure, however, Florida authorities may decide the Miami case should be dropped and the suspect put on a plane to Paris. Brian McDonald, Arce Montez's American lawyer, has said he is \"convinced that the US authorities will at the very least consider\" such a request, and that his client - deemed a high suicide risk - could exchange his bed in the psychiatric wing of Dade County jail for a French prison cell before the summer.",

Fantasise away to your heart's content - indeed, why not introduce your fantasies into your \"satisfactory sex life\", but keep your fantasies as just that. What do you hope to achieve by taking them further? You claim to love your husband - have you no sense of loyalty or commitment? Marriages don't just happen - both partners have to work hard - and there are always plenty of temptations which have to be kept in check in order for the relationship to stand a chance.</p> <p>Considering this attraction further is not a constructive way to deal with your flat emotions. You say that you have a happy marriage; surely it's better that you invest energy into revitalising what you have and spice up your sex life rather than pursuing a course which will inevitably lead to the breakdown of your marriage and cause much unhappiness within your family. <br><b> Beryl Docherty, London</b></p> <p><b> Consider the effects </b><br></p> <p>Having recently had an affair with a female friend who has both children and a husband, there are some points I would urge you to consider. Firstly, how sure are you of your feelings? Do you have someone you could talk to? Do you have any inkling about your friend's feelings? If you are sure that she would be uninterested, then do not say or do a thing - your friendship may never be the same.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, you think she may be receptive, an affair with her could be one of the most thrilling events of your life. The problem is, however, that affairs are never problem free. Could you and your friend live with the guilt and the deception? How would your husband/children react if they found out? Having a heterosexual affair is shocking enough, but a homosexual one brings with it a lot more prejudice, and pressure. What would happen if one of you later discovered that it had all been a horrible mistake?</p> <p>I would try to ascertain the true nature of your feelings for this friend. Is this a passing thing? Or could you be looking at a lifestyle change? Above all proceed cautiously, and see if there is someone you could confide in who will not judge you. <br><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Feelings are hard to deny </b><br></p> <p>You are far from alone in your dilemma. I too thought I was happily married but chose to explore a relationship with a female friend. The result was eventually a complete transformation of my life. Lesbian feelings, once aroused, were impossible to suppress. After several years of struggling to resolve the situation with my husband we eventually separated. I am now happily established in a lesbian relationship, and sharing parentage of my children with my ex-husband.</p> <p>However, it was a terrible shock for him and a very difficult process to go through. You need to be aware of the potentially huge implications of following your feelings. <br><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>I bought my own flat nine years ago and live alone with two cats. At 46 I'm getting used to the idea that I will probably never meet a man who wants to settle down. The relationships I've had in the past have always been stormy, with no likelihood of becoming long term. I have a few good friends, plenty of interests, a responsible job and wonderful nephews and nieces, so I don't feel my life is empty without a partner. What really makes me unhappy is living on my own.</p> <p>The idea of spending my retirement years living alone fills me with dread.

Marriages don't just happen - both partners have to work hard - and there are always plenty of temptations which have to be kept in check in order for the relationship to stand a chance. Considering this attraction further is not a constructive way to deal with your flat emotions. You say that you have a happy marriage; surely it's better that you invest energy into revitalising what you have and spice up your sex life rather than pursuing a course which will inevitably lead to the breakdown of your marriage and cause much unhappiness within your family. Beryl Docherty, London Consider the effects Having recently had an affair with a female friend who has both children and a husband, there are some points I would urge you to consider. Firstly, how sure are you of your feelings? Do you have someone you could talk to? Do you have any inkling about your friend's feelings? If you are sure that she would be uninterested, then do not say or do a thing - your friendship may never be the same. If, on the other hand, you think she may be receptive, an affair with her could be one of the most thrilling events of your life. The problem is, however, that affairs are never problem free. Could you and your friend live with the guilt and the deception? How would your husband/children react if they found out? Having a heterosexual affair is shocking enough, but a homosexual one brings with it a lot more prejudice, and pressure. What would happen if one of you later discovered that it had all been a horrible mistake? I would try to ascertain the true nature of your feelings for this friend. Is this a passing thing? Or could you be looking at a lifestyle change? Above all proceed cautiously, and see if there is someone you could confide in who will not judge you. Name and address withheld Feelings are hard to deny You are far from alone in your dilemma. I too thought I was happily married but chose to explore a relationship with a female friend. The result was eventually a complete transformation of my life. Lesbian feelings, once aroused, were impossible to suppress. After several years of struggling to resolve the situation with my husband we eventually separated. I am now happily established in a lesbian relationship, and sharing parentage of my children with my ex-husband. However, it was a terrible shock for him and a very difficult process to go through. You need to be aware of the potentially huge implications of following your feelings. Name and address withheld Next week I bought my own flat nine years ago and live alone with two cats. At 46 I'm getting used to the idea that I will probably never meet a man who wants to settle down. The relationships I've had in the past have always been stormy, with no likelihood of becoming long term. I have a few good friends, plenty of interests, a responsible job and wonderful nephews and nieces, so I don't feel my life is empty without a partner. What really makes me unhappy is living on my own. The idea of spending my retirement years living alone fills me with dread. Should I have another try at meeting \"Mr Right\", or is there another way of sharing my life and my home? \u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

Amorous occasionally,\" he says, quickly adding, \"but not with me. Not yet.\" At lunatic speed, Jonathan can satiate the appetites of 15 households in Maida Vale and St Johns Wood in one morning. His short-term plan is to stretch the business south so he can cover from Islington to Clapham and all the areas in between. \"Assuming it works and I think it will catch on,\" he adds, \"I'd then like to start it up in other major cities like Manchester and Bristol.\" It is simply a matter of time before the nation's early morning munchies and Nurofen needs are in safe hands.",

Yesterday the pair were being questioned in a north London police station. The arrests came after an intelligence tipoff and surveillance operation, a spokesman said. Dozens of people had responded to an appeal for witnesses to the incident. Mrs Sherlock was killed after being run over by the thieves' getaway vehicle. She had been with her husband in a coffee shop at Euston station, central London, when her handbag, containing just \u00a320, was snatched. The 42-year-old from Chiswick, west London, chased the thieves into the street, but was hit by their car and swept on to the bonnet, before slipping under its wheels. She died later of multiple injuries. Police also released a photograph of the vehicle believed to have been used in the getaway, a white E-reg Ford Fiesta. It was found abandoned nearby shortly afterwards. Detectives would have to charge the two suspects within 24 hours, a spokesman said, unless an extension was granted by a police superintendent. Suspects can be held for up to 96 hours without charge, with the permission of a magistrate. The designer, who had worked for the BBC on programmes including Last of the Summer Wine, It's a Knockout and the Royal Variety Performance, had been on the way to Bolton, Lancashire, to celebrate her father's 79th birthday. Mrs Sherlock's husband Peter, 48, a computer programmer, said yesterday that his wife's parents, Joseph and Doris Nicholls, had travelled to London to be with him. It was also revealed yesterday that street robberies in London have soared by almost a fifth in the past year, according to Scotland Yard figures. Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens said that tackling such offences remained a \"major challenge\" for the force. \"There will be absolutely no let-up in our efforts to get on top of street robbery across the capital.\"",

Pray, when do we holidaymakers find time to plan a term's lessons, covering all the subjects in the national curriculum, plus a couple more, visit museums etc to prepare class visits, troll round bookshops and historic sites buying resources and books to bolster up a flagging system? When can we set individual targets for our children, class targets for our classes, write letters to parents informing them of said targets? When can we level our children, so that the DfEE can keep a tab on our performance? Who puts up the displays necessary to provide a \"stimulating and welcoming environment\" so beloved of Ofsted inspectors? Oh, I forgot the dental visits, doctor's appointments, visits to vet, hairdresser etc that has to be undertaken in my own time. Last, but certainly not least, when do I talk to my own children, who constantly remind me they feel neglected because both mum and dad are teachers? Please think again before you perpetrate the myth still further. I love the teaching bit; I know much of the paper work helps me do my job - but 13 weeks holiday is a joke or even an insult.
