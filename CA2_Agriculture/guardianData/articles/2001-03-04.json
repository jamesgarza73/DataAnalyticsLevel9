      "body": "<p> I once knew Eliza Doolittle like a best friend. I played her in a school production of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion and loved every minute of the metamorphosis from Covent Garden flower girl in a dented black straw hat to fine lady, zipped into my mother's velvet ballgown trimmed with gold. But I was also aware that there was something I could not get the hang of about Eliza, something troubling beneath the surface of her story. For this is not - and never has been - a regular fairytale. </p> <p>On 15 March, at the National Theatre, Trevor Nunn's production of My Fair Lady, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's 1956 musical based on Pygmalion, opens with Martine McCutcheon as Eliza. McCutcheon, star of EastEnders and Top of the Pops (she reached number one with 'Perfect Moment'), will be the first Eliza who, as Trevor Nunn delicately puts it, 'will have no trouble with authentic London street speech'. </p> <p>This is canny casting, to put it mildly, and McCutcheon, born and bred in Clapton, will be supported by Jonathan Pryce as Higgins and Nicholas le Prevost as Pickering. The choreography will be by Matthew Bourne of Adventures in Moving Pictures and the design by Anthony Ward. Hopes for the show could not be higher and McCutcheon may well prove the most authentic Eliza yet. It is not only that, like Eliza, she will have to learn to speak proper, but her own life resembles Eliza's in some ways. McCutcheon suffered from a drunken, violent father but did not let this stop her single-minded rise to stardom. And unlike Audrey Hepburn, who had to be dubbed by Marni Nixon in the film of My Fair Lady, McCutcheon can sing. </p> <p>The Cockney noise Eliza goes in for is tricky. There is much squawking and groaning: 'Ah-ah-ah-ow-ow-oo!' I preferred the moment of enunciating in a posh accent: 'Not bloody likely' in the luxurious certainty that it would always get a laugh. What I did not know was that it was this line that, in April 1914, at once scandalised audiences and sealed the play's success. George Bernard Shaw described the reaction to Eliza's words on the first night: 'They laughed themselves into such utter abandonment and disorder... that it was really doubtful for some time whether they could recover themselves and let the play go on.' </p> <p>Just under a century later, Eliza Doolittle has lost the power to shock. She has also lost the power to teach. Shaw boasted that his play was didactic. He was a Fabian and a socialist and believed he had pulled off an illuminating practical joke in which elocution is the key to social advancement. Michael Holroyd, in his superb biography of Shaw, describes Pygmalion as 'an integration of Faustian legend and Cinderella fairytale, a comedy of manners and a parable of socialism'. Nunn extends this: 'Shaw gives the lie to the way our society is organised and to all its assumptions. He has aristocrats admiring a girl they would revile if they knew who she was'. But the idea that accent is a key to success is, happily, no longer as persuasive. </p> <p>So why hasn't Eliza herself dated? Why does she still captivate us? It is partly that My Fair Lady is the ultimate makeover story. Nunn suggests it is because 'she is absolutely archetypal. We respond to every form of the story of rags to riches'. He cites Jamie Bell/Billy Elliot as the latest example of this. </p> <p>Eliza Doolittle is 97. She has undergone many changes in just under a century. She has been the star of Pygmalion the play, Pygmalion the film (1938) and the star of My Fair Lady on stage (1956) and screen (1964). Nunn describes Alan Jay Lerner's work as a 'brilliantly thoughtful interpretation. He edits and focuses, he does not create new situations'. But Eliza's feisty character stays the same. It is only about the ending - of which more later - that Eliza's admirers disagree. </p> <p>Nowadays, I find myself as much discomforted as amused by Higgins's merry misogyny... worst of all, I suspect Shaw of being on Higgins's side to a disagreeable degree. I fear he enjoys the shaming aspect of the experiment (how to turn cabbage leaf into cabbage rose), but at least he had the grace to give Eliza the temperament (as opposed to a fully realised character) with which to win her audience's heart. </p> <p>Trevor Nunn concedes that Eliza is more temperament than character. Her 'volatility' is the key: 'We meet her in an angry mood. Many girls in her situation [when her basket is knocked over] would say sorry, pick up their flowers and creep away.' She wants to be paid. Eliza takes a raucous pride in being herself. She knows more about manners than Higgins could ever guess and her temperament, says Nunn, is 'going to be useful to her as an independent woman'. </p> <p>Eliza has been hailed as a feminist heroine, a first cousin to Nora in Ibsen's The Doll's House. Diana Rigg played her this way in the 1974 production directed by John Dexter. And Liz Robertson, who played the role in My Fair Lady opposite Tony Britton in the late Seventies, still champions Eliza for her 'courage, her fierce ambition to better herself. The suffragettes would have admired her'. </p> <p>Frances Barber, who played Eliza in Howard Davies' 1992 production of Pygmalion at the National, agrees. She would only complain that the famous slipper scene (when Eliza, mortified that Higgins has failed to praise her for her triumph, hurls his slippers at him) does not go far enough. It is a scene, incidentally, that Holroyd regards as 'sadomasochistic'. Barber says: 'I felt the slipper was a pathetic missile. It should have been an armchair. I could have murdered him.' But she adds her Eliza would have hoped to have 'made love with him later'. </p> <p>The first Eliza Doolittle was in her late forties. Mrs Patrick Campbell (known to her friends as Stella) was a dark-eyed beauty but more flower dame than girl. It was sometimes thought that she was more remarkable for her stage presence than for her acting talent. The production was staged by actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Shaw had written the part with Mrs Campbell in mind although Eliza's character is partly based on his mother. </p> <p>Shaw was years older than Stella and punishingly 'violently and exquisitely' in love with her, as he confessed in a letter to Granville Barker. Michael Holroyd tells me she was 'the only woman he was sexually attracted to'. She made him suffer so much that at one point he wrote: 'The quantity of love that an ordinary person can stand without serious damage... is about 10 minutes in 50 years.' </p> <p>Shaw was not certain that she would condescend to play such a vulgar role but when she overheard Shaw reading her part (he read aloud well), she was flattered and wrote to thank him for 'thinking I can be your pretty little slut'. Later, she promised: 'I'll be as tame as a mouse and oh so obedient - and I wonder if you'll get what you want out of me... ' Anything less like an obedient mouse could scarcely be imagined than her Eliza. She was said by Shaw to have 'ravished the house almost to delirium'. </p> <p>Julie Andrews was the first Eliza in the Broadway production of My Fair Lady, directed by Moss Hart, and with exquisite costumes by Cecil Beaton was every bit as successful as Mrs Campbell and broke box-office records in a role that she sang for three-and-a-half years in 2,717 performances. Paul Newman saw her Eliza and described her as 'one of the last really great broads'. </p> <p>But in 1962, Jack Warner, against all expectations, decided not to cast Andrews in the film role and Audrey Hepburn, who could not sing, got the part instead. Andrews has since confessed in interviews to a retrospective sorrow, while always insisting that she and Hepburn became the best of friends. Hepburn once said to Andrews: 'I felt you should have done it but I didn't have the guts to turn it down.' Andrews's understandably starchy response to this was: 'It was a wonderful role. Why would anyone turn it down?' </p> <p>The film cost $17 million and was directed by George Cukor. It was the most expensive movie Warner had made. Hepburn looked sweet as any violet but her Cockney accent was endearingly abysmal ('mud' is pronounced 'mad'). </p> <p>Nunn argues that one of the strengths of My Fair Lady is that, unlike Pygmalion, it explores the struggle to speak. We watch Eliza with her mouth full of marbles or speaking into a tube - this looks like a delicate form of torture. Higgins is not only teaching Eliza to speak, but he is schooling her in silences, and Hepburn supplies these divinely where required. But she can also be a wildcat. After she has ejected herself from Higgins' s house, she looks like an aggressive peach. </p> <p>The contested question about Eliza Doolittle is the one she asks herself: what is to become of her in the end? In the play, she leaves Higgins. This is the hard, realistic ending. Shaw, stubborn as a rock, resisted the tidal wave of wishes (from audience and actors like) that Eliza and Higgins should come together. He ignored the truth that there is nothing sexier than overcoming apparently impossible obstacles in love. </p> <p>In a vexing epilogue to Pygmalion, he marries Eliza off to her vacuous admirer, Freddie. Frances Barber is with Shaw all the way. She says it 'hurt' to watch the film and see Eliza compromise herself and stay with Higgins. But Liz Robertson, who was the eighth and final wife of Alan Jay Lerner, rejoices in the ending. She admits, however, that when Lerner had Eliza poignantly returning to Higgins and repeating her line from the beginning - 'I washed my face and hands afore I come, I did' - he had difficulty getting it past Shaw's estate and there was 'a huge fight'. </p> <p>Shaw's resistance to the romantic ending must partly have reflected his grief over Stella, his firm intention to put real life, with its compromises and disappointment, before fairy tale. Robertson comments: 'Shaw was a very weird man, never able to commit himself physically. But it was absolutely wrong to suggest that Eliza would marry Freddie. Freddie is such an oaf. It defies her character.' </p> <p>Nunn is confident that Shaw would not have disapproved of the popular ending of My Fair Lady had he lived to see it. Michael Holroyd disagrees. The romantic ending of the film Pygmalion, directed by Gabriel Pascal, was written behind Shaw's back by another scriptwriter. But Nunn retaliates by saying: 'Shaw accepted an Oscar for the screenplay.' Would he have done this if he had disapproved? I ask Holroyd why Shaw held out against the ending that, however much we admire the integrity of Pygmalion, we all secretly desire? He does not hesitate. He says the romantic ending was the 'subtext' to play. 'It was what Shaw suppressed in himself.' </p> <p> My Fair Lady runs from Tuesday until 30 June at the National Theatre, London SE1.

      "byline": "Amy Raphael",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Real Madrid have won again and Steve McManaman is first into the players' lounge at the Bernabeu stadium. On his way in, he acknowledges the bank of jostling photographers and journalists with a wink and a grin, then shies away from the sudden white light as dozens of cameras flash. Inside, he greets his girlfriend Victoria with a kiss and accepts the beer waiting for him. After gulping it down in two mouthfuls and seeing Victoria's empty wine glass, he goes to the bar. </p> <p>'Una mas cerveza e uno vino tinto, por favor.' </p> <p>By some remarkable trick of international language, his guttural Scouse makes the Spanish accent near perfect. </p> <p>A few moments later his mobile rings. It's his dad. 'All right, da,' he says, smiling. 'Yeah, it was a good game. Of course I started. Liverpool did okay yesterday, they beat West Ham 3-0. Yeah, I know, Robbie called me to say he'd got two.' As he finishes the call, Roberto Carlos appears. McManaman says, sotto voce: 'I love him to bits, but I bet he's wearing one of his dodgy Versace shirts.' </p> <p>Indeed he is: a ridiculously shiny black shirt and black suit loose enough to disguise his extraordinary thighs. Carlos kisses Victoria on both cheeks, standing on his tiptoes to reach her - at 5ft4in he is a good four inches smaller than her. He winks at McManaman and goes to the bar to order a beer. </p> <p>As McManaman discusses the evening's plans with Victoria, Jorge Valdano, Real Madrid's director general, nods at him. Luis Figo wanders in and sits in a corner on his own. He is not going anywhere this evening, only back to his rented house, but between his knees is a Louis Vuitton suitcase. He makes no attempt to go to the bar but smiles as other players - Ivan Campo and Claude Makelele - pass on the way there. </p> <p>It is only 8pm - still far too early to eat in Madrid, even on a Sunday - so McManaman suggests a few drinks at a nearby hotel. As we leave, the press shout his name. He knows how important it is to keep them happy, but instead he signs autographs for a group of patient fans. The group grows bigger, but he's had enough. 'Time for another beer,' he says, taking Victoria's hand and striding off to the car. </p> <p> That Steve McManaman should still be sharing a players' lounge with the likes of Roberto Carlos and Luis Figo is something of a miracle. Having joined the club in the summer of 1999, his first year involved a lot of watching Real Madrid and not much playing for them, a spell on the sidelines that included three months out injured. Gradually, he began to establish himself in an improving team - and the season reached a glorious climax for both when he scored a marvellous goal against Valencia in last year's European Cup final, a game in which many made him man of the match. </p> <p>Yet if McManaman then thought he finally belonged at Real, the feeling was not to last long. While playing a peripheral part in England's disastrous Euro 2000 campaign a few weeks later, he learnt that the club's fans had voted in a new president, Florentino Perez. Central to Perez's campaign was the astonishing promise to sign Luis Figo - the best player at Barcelona, Real's hated rivals, and the only club in Spain capable of matching them in terms of stature, support and tradition. </p> <p>Even more astonishingly Perez was able to pull off the coup, though in doing so the club had to set a world transfer record of \u00a337m. And therein lay the problem. For despite being one of the world's most famous clubs, Real are also its most indebted, reportedly owing more than \u00a3110m. The arrival of Figo meant there had to be cost-cutting and, with his weekly wage said to exceed \u00a370,000, McManaman became an expendable luxury. </p> <p>So, a year after signing McManaman on a free transfer from Liverpool, Real Madrid did everything in their power to offload him. Stories appeared every day as to his likely destination - Lazio, Manchester United, even Middlesbrough. The coach, Vicente del Bosque, insisted the Englishman was no longer part of his plans. </p> <p>The new season approached and with it came the final humiliation: not only was McManaman out of the team, he wasn't even given a squad number. Yet McManaman knew he possessed the trump card: Real couldn't actually force him to sign for anyone else. He had a contract that took him to 2003 and he intended to honour it. </p> <p>He was also gaining the upper hand by behaving with extraordinary dignity, refusing to throw tantrums or even to criticise Real Madrid. He carefully maintained he loved the club, the city, its supporters, and became something of a hero to Real's fans and admired even by Barcelona's. </p> <p>The club began to soften its attitude; they had managed to sell another popular player, Fernando Redondo, to Milan but realised McManaman was there to stay. In September, he was given a squad number. He was still spending most games on the bench but the public were behind him; in the city centre, he was stopped every few steps by fans begging him to stay. </p> <p>He hinted at an interest in Lazio and said: 'There's not a chance I will be sitting on that bench after Christmas having started two games. Not a chance.' His confidence proved well-founded. As the season progressed McManaman began to get a game more regularly. And the team in which even Figo had initially looked out of place began to gel. By the time McManaman was orchestrating the destruction of Leeds United in the Champions League in November, it was clear that Real Madrid were destined to be much better than they were last season - when they may have been European champions but only finished fifth in the league. </p> <p>McManaman remains reluctant to talk about those dark times in the summer and early autumn, though it is clear his experiences of isolation and frustration left a scar even on a personality as bubbly and upbeat as his. He much prefers to concentrate on the present, to look forward to the possibility of another European final. He will, however, dismiss last summer's speculation about his return to England: 'I've joked that I'd rather play for Outer Mongolia or Torquay than some Premiership side. I did speak to Bryan Robson on the phone but I was never interested in going to Boro. I admire Robbo but I had no intention of going home.' </p> <p>He can't remember the day Del Bosque changed his mind; he simply says that the coach doesn't talk very much, but that once you get in the first team, you tend to keep your place. Diego Torres, a reporter with El Pais, sees no reason why McManaman should lose his place. 'He's a very intelligent though not very skilful player. He can manage the Real Madrid shirt because he can read the game so well. It would be difficult to send him to the bench now because he is so appreciated by his team-mates; they all want him to play. They respect him. They know he can defend as well as attack. In a world of stars he is an incredibly unselfish player.' </p> <p>Yet, such is the Byzantine world in which McManaman finds himself, Torres thinks this might not be enough. 'Macca is also the third highest paid player, after Figo and Raul. He earns 700m pesetas (\u00a32.6m) a season. The club wanted to let him go last summer, and I think they will try to sell him again this summer - because their long-term policy is to cut wages.' </p> <p>If they do, they can expect another furious response from their fans, many of whom were less than impressed by Redondo's departure. Torres adds: 'McManaman doesn't speak Spanish fluently, but he's a natural communicator and he socialises well. He's expressive, he has charm. Most of the other players - Raul, Figo, Hierro - are dull and serious, but Macca laughs all the time. He changes the atmosphere in the dressing-room. He was very important in the final in Paris; the most important player alongside Redondo. Not just for the goal he scored but because he proved what a great tactical mind he has. He was fantastic .' </p> <p> McManaman's phone rings again. It is Michelle from the FA. She says Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson will be coming over the following week to watch Real Madrid play Lazio and wonders if McManaman can recommend any hotels. 'The Ritz is okay; I stayed there when I arrived in Madrid. I think Eriksson might like it there, it's very central and right next to the Prado museum...' She asks how he is getting on and he laughs. 'Since October, I've played in every bloody game, but no one at home realises. I've been playing very well, but they think I'm struggling to get a game.' </p> <p>When he finishes the call, I ask if he expects to see Eriksson. He shrugs. 'I don't expect so. He'll probably just come and go. I was cool about him being made manager. The players wanted Venables back but that obviously wasn't going to happen. </p> <p>'Everyone knows what the England job entails and it's more than just picking a squad of 20 players. They're never fit for a start. Then having a relationship with all the Premiership managers, let alone having to please the press and the fans. It really is a job and a half. </p> <p>'I don't really feel as though I've got a point to prove with England, but I haven't had that many games. I scored in Euro 2000 and then I was injured. It's very frustrating sitting on the bench, thinking you could make a difference if only you were playing. You might not actually be able to change a game, but you always have to think you can. </p> <p>'I was shocked when Kevin Keegan resigned. I had been in the stands during the game and when I walked in, the dressing-room was silent. I had to ask Robbie [Fowler] what was going on. Keegan had been pretty emotional. I think he said he'd tried but that he hadn't been able to get a good result. He said that as he walked off the pitch all he could hear was the fans shouting abuse. Everyone seemed really disappointed; we'd just got beaten by Germany in the last ever game at Wembley in the first game of the World Cup 2002 qualifiers. The weather was terrible. Then he came in and made his announcement. We were upset, but we knew we had to play Finland four days later. We knew we had to get back to business.' </p> <p> When I first interviewed McManaman - over lunch - six years ago, we met up with Robbie Fowler, went for a drink, and didn't stop till past midnight. I was worried his hangover would get him into trouble; he simply got up an hour earlier to run off the beer. McManaman has remained much the same ever since, still the boy from a Kirkdale council house who dreamt of playing for Everton, still the boy who turned down a scholarship to the city's most prestigious private school to sign up with Kenny Dalglish's Liverpool. </p> <p>His first pay cheques were around \u00a360 a week and although he is now a multi-millionaire, able to buy his father and sister a house each, he cares little for the celebrity lifestyle - in Liverpool he used to give his best mate Gordon a bundle of cash at the start of a night out, so he wasn't seen buying all the drinks. He still sees Gordon and other old friends and he's exceptionally close to his family - since his mother died just before he left for Madrid, he counts his father as one of his best mates. </p> <p>As we travel to the centre of Madrid in Victoria's silver VW Beetle, McManaman is in high spirits. Dido's 'Thankyou' (the track sampled on Eminem's 'Stan') is on the stereo, the team have won and the night is young. He is laughing about Trigger Happy TV and keeps asking how many times he has to listen to 'Dodo'. </p> <p>He gets out of the car and heads towards the bar, La Taurina. With bull's heads hang ing from the walls and tiled images of el toro, it is a shrine to bull fighting and, though McManaman has never been to a fight, he talks with some passion about how to kill the bull. A television shows highlights from the weekend's games, including Stan Collymore's first appearance for Real Oviedo. Collymore, who played with McManaman at Liverpool, jogs slowly across the screen. McManaman smiles and shakes his head. 'Do you know who he's going to play up front with?' He starts laughing. 'A bloke called Oli.' He pauses for effect. 'Stan and Oli. Hahaha.' </p> <p>His phone rings again. It's David James, another former team-mate, who now plays in goal for Aston Villa. ' Hola amigo! I'm in a bar in Madrid!' he says, imitating Dom Joly on Trigger Happy TV. 'What you speaking Spanish for, Jamo? Oh, you're learning Spanish, German and Italian just in case? Yeah, I know Growler scored two against West Ham.' </p> <p>A group of lads approach, asking for a photo and autographs. Others stare and point across the bar. The waiter is so nervous he knocks a glass of beer on to the floor. A plate of jamon arrives and while picking idly at it, McManaman lists the attractions of living in Madrid. 'Here you can drink all night, have some breakfast and pick up your paper on the way home. As long as the team is winning, it's not a problem to go for a meal and have a few drinks after a game. And we play some fantastic football here.' </p> <p>He smiles, nostalgic for a brief moment. 'Liverpool was great, but it's not as though I left when I was really young. I came here when I was 27, after more than 10 years at the club. Liverpool is a tiny city compared to Madrid. The lifestyle here is completely different - most places in Liverpool shut at 2am.' </p> <p>At Christmas, when the Primera Liga has a week-long break, McManaman returned to his home city and watched Liverpool play Arsenal. He got a hug from manager G\u00e9rard Houllier, a handshake from the chairman and kisses from the backroom staff. Then on Boxing Day, he did something he hasn't been able to do since his father used to carry him over the turnstiles when he was a young boy; he went to watch Everton. He sounds particularly pleased that he was offered 20 per cent discount in the souvenir shop. </p> <p> The most successful club in the world has a ramshackle training ground five minutes' drive from the Bernabeu. For such a glamorous club, the club once supported by Franco, Real Madrid has the most basic training facilities; two old pitches, an old concrete building housing the changing rooms and a Portakabin outside for the press. It is a set-up which would embarrass the average First Division club in England. </p> <p>A few hundred fans jump up and down in the sharp February wind as they watch McManaman, whippet thin and white as paper, laughing with Roberto Carlos. After an hour in which McManaman doesn't stop laughing and joking, the players drift off to the showers. </p> <p>Driving in his BMW from the ground to his house, McManaman listens to Fatboy Slim and talks about the myth of the Primera Liga, or at least of Real Madrid. 'People think we train much harder over here, have a stricter diet, watch endless videos of the opposition. But I get up, miss breakfast, drive to training, stagger around and go home. The English press used to talk about Liverpool being the Spice Boys and Roy Evans used to get a load of stick for being too much of a nice guy, but that's the biggest load of rubbish.' </p> <p>He plays with the key ring dangling from the ignition; on it is a silver cup displaying the figure '8' for the number of European Cups won by Real Madrid. 'It is more relaxed here than it ever was at Liverpool. The manager trusts us. Players have a glass of wine or a beer the night before a match. Only one, but still. I think that if you've got fantastic players who want to win every game, in the end nothing else matters.' </p> <p>He pulls up at the lights and leans out of the window. 'This is our local loon,' he says nodding to a fan. 'He's always hanging around by this intersection after training... All right, Bruno, mate?' </p> <p>Bruno puts his face up close to McManaman's. 'I've got you a souvenir, Macca,' he says, producing a programme from Sunday's game and salivating with excitement. He has another programme which he asks McManaman to sign. </p> <p>'How many times do you need my autograph?' mutters McManaman, but not particularly seriously. </p> <p> 'Que pasa, Bruno?' He asks, grinning. The lights turn green. 'Hasta manana, Bruno.' </p> <p>Bruno waves at the car, a delighted smile on his face. </p> <p>McManaman shakes his head. 'Whatever time we turn up at the airport after an away game, Bruno is always there waiting for us. Always. I gave him one of my old Liverpool shirts and he was made up, but of course in some ways it's just made him worse.' </p> <p>The car draws up at the villa which McManaman shares with Victoria on a huge private estate north of the city and 10 minutes' drive from the airport. A six-bedroom marble palace with an outdoor pool (which McManaman has used just once), it is rented from the club - they recently bought a villa of their own in Majorca. </p> <p>Victoria is just home from work. A qualified barrister, she now teaches English law to Spanish students. She met McManaman in a night club in Liverpool seven years ago while studying for her A-levels. She was reluctant to see him again - she was working hard and not very interested in going out with a footballer - but her mother talked her into it. She fell in love with him, she says, very quickly. Victoria loves Madrid - she speaks fluent Spanish, as well as French and German - but not as Mrs Steve McManaman. She loathes being thought of as the trophy girlfriend, and tells her students her boyfriend is a plumber. </p> <p>McManaman lies back on a white leather sofa, turns on the television and smiles. Time to tune into the one aspect of English life he cannot leave behind. Horse racing. Victoria tuts and goes off to make tea. 'I love my racing,' he says. 'When I retire, I'm going to go and watch my three horses as often as I can. Between looking after the kids, of course. I've agreed with Victoria that when we have kids, she will continue working as a barrister and I'll be a house husband.' </p> <p>When is he thinking of retiring? 'I've probably got another five or six years if my legs hold up,' says McManaman, who was 29 last month. 'I very rarely missed games for Liverpool - I even played two full seasons - and last season I played 60 games for Real. I'll always be fit to a certain extent because of my skinny body. I can still run around all day. It's whether I can still hack it in five years' time with all these young lads coming on who will run past me calling me \"old man\", just as I used to do when I was young.' </p> <p>On some days McManaman is convinced that once his playing career is over he will be finished with football. On others, when he realises how easily he becomes bored when there's no Champions League game mid-week and Victoria has returned to Liverpool to visit her family, he considers a future in management. 'Of course I'll miss football incredibly . But who knows what might happen? I might be offered a youth team job at the end of my career or I might just be sent packing. Growler has always said he thinks I'll make a good manager... Could you imagine me and him running Liverpool one day?' </p> <p> Towards 11pm we arrive at a restaurant in central Madrid. A converted theatre designed by Philippe Starck, it is still half-empty. McManaman says it's a beautiful building but he can barely work out the difference between the urinals and the wash basins. </p> <p>His phone rings again and this time it's Robbie Fowler. They talk for five minutes and when he says goodbye, McManaman sports a childish grin. The waiters are too discreet to stare, but they keep looking at him out of the corner of their eyes. He orders pasta with lobster and a steak, then more beers - 'when in Spain, do as the Spanish and have lots to drink' - and shares a cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e with Victoria. </p> <p>Finally, at about 3am, we leave the restaurant. Dido is still on the stereo. McManaman pulls up outside my hotel and gets out to say goodbye. Victoria gets out too, and as 'Thankyou' begins again, she takes her boyfriend by the hand and starts slowly waltzing. A taxi driver looks at this young couple holding each other close on the pavement. Suddenly he recognises one of Real Madrid's star players. He smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Real Madrid have won again and Steve McManaman is first into the players' lounge at the Bernabeu stadium. On his way in, he acknowledges the bank of jostling photographers and journalists with a wink and a grin, then shies away from the sudden white light as dozens of cameras flash. Inside, he greets his girlfriend Victoria with a kiss and accepts the beer waiting for him. After gulping it down in two mouthfuls and seeing Victoria's empty wine glass, he goes to the bar. 'Una mas cerveza e uno vino tinto, por favor.' By some remarkable trick of international language, his guttural Scouse makes the Spanish accent near perfect. A few moments later his mobile rings. It's his dad. 'All right, da,' he says, smiling. 'Yeah, it was a good game. Of course I started. Liverpool did okay yesterday, they beat West Ham 3-0. Yeah, I know, Robbie called me to say he'd got two.' As he finishes the call, Roberto Carlos appears. McManaman says, sotto voce: 'I love him to bits, but I bet he's wearing one of his dodgy Versace shirts.' Indeed he is: a ridiculously shiny black shirt and black suit loose enough to disguise his extraordinary thighs. Carlos kisses Victoria on both cheeks, standing on his tiptoes to reach her - at 5ft4in he is a good four inches smaller than her. He winks at McManaman and goes to the bar to order a beer. As McManaman discusses the evening's plans with Victoria, Jorge Valdano, Real Madrid's director general, nods at him. Luis Figo wanders in and sits in a corner on his own. He is not going anywhere this evening, only back to his rented house, but between his knees is a Louis Vuitton suitcase. He makes no attempt to go to the bar but smiles as other players - Ivan Campo and Claude Makelele - pass on the way there. It is only 8pm - still far too early to eat in Madrid, even on a Sunday - so McManaman suggests a few drinks at a nearby hotel. As we leave, the press shout his name. He knows how important it is to keep them happy, but instead he signs autographs for a group of patient fans. The group grows bigger, but he's had enough. 'Time for another beer,' he says, taking Victoria's hand and striding off to the car. That Steve McManaman should still be sharing a players' lounge with the likes of Roberto Carlos and Luis Figo is something of a miracle. Having joined the club in the summer of 1999, his first year involved a lot of watching Real Madrid and not much playing for them, a spell on the sidelines that included three months out injured. Gradually, he began to establish himself in an improving team - and the season reached a glorious climax for both when he scored a marvellous goal against Valencia in last year's European Cup final, a game in which many made him man of the match. Yet if McManaman then thought he finally belonged at Real, the feeling was not to last long. While playing a peripheral part in England's disastrous Euro 2000 campaign a few weeks later, he learnt that the club's fans had voted in a new president, Florentino Perez. Central to Perez's campaign was the astonishing promise to sign Luis Figo - the best player at Barcelona, Real's hated rivals, and the only club in Spain capable of matching them in terms of stature, support and tradition. Even more astonishingly Perez was able to pull off the coup, though in doing so the club had to set a world transfer record of \u00a337m. And therein lay the problem. For despite being one of the world's most famous clubs, Real are also its most indebted, reportedly owing more than \u00a3110m. The arrival of Figo meant there had to be cost-cutting and, with his weekly wage said to exceed \u00a370,000, McManaman became an expendable luxury. So, a year after signing McManaman on a free transfer from Liverpool, Real Madrid did everything in their power to offload him. Stories appeared every day as to his likely destination - Lazio, Manchester United, even Middlesbrough. The coach, Vicente del Bosque, insisted the Englishman was no longer part of his plans. The new season approached and with it came the final humiliation: not only was McManaman out of the team, he wasn't even given a squad number. Yet McManaman knew he possessed the trump card: Real couldn't actually force him to sign for anyone else. He had a contract that took him to 2003 and he intended to honour it. He was also gaining the upper hand by behaving with extraordinary dignity, refusing to throw tantrums or even to criticise Real Madrid. He carefully maintained he loved the club, the city, its supporters, and became something of a hero to Real's fans and admired even by Barcelona's. The club began to soften its attitude; they had managed to sell another popular player, Fernando Redondo, to Milan but realised McManaman was there to stay. In September, he was given a squad number. He was still spending most games on the bench but the public were behind him; in the city centre, he was stopped every few steps by fans begging him to stay. He hinted at an interest in Lazio and said: 'There's not a chance I will be sitting on that bench after Christmas having started two games. Not a chance.' His confidence proved well-founded. As the season progressed McManaman began to get a game more regularly. And the team in which even Figo had initially looked out of place began to gel. By the time McManaman was orchestrating the destruction of Leeds United in the Champions League in November, it was clear that Real Madrid were destined to be much better than they were last season - when they may have been European champions but only finished fifth in the league. McManaman remains reluctant to talk about those dark times in the summer and early autumn, though it is clear his experiences of isolation and frustration left a scar even on a personality as bubbly and upbeat as his. He much prefers to concentrate on the present, to look forward to the possibility of another European final. He will, however, dismiss last summer's speculation about his return to England: 'I've joked that I'd rather play for Outer Mongolia or Torquay than some Premiership side. I did speak to Bryan Robson on the phone but I was never interested in going to Boro. I admire Robbo but I had no intention of going home.' He can't remember the day Del Bosque changed his mind; he simply says that the coach doesn't talk very much, but that once you get in the first team, you tend to keep your place. Diego Torres, a reporter with El Pais, sees no reason why McManaman should lose his place. 'He's a very intelligent though not very skilful player. He can manage the Real Madrid shirt because he can read the game so well. It would be difficult to send him to the bench now because he is so appreciated by his team-mates; they all want him to play. They respect him. They know he can defend as well as attack. In a world of stars he is an incredibly unselfish player.' Yet, such is the Byzantine world in which McManaman finds himself, Torres thinks this might not be enough. 'Macca is also the third highest paid player, after Figo and Raul. He earns 700m pesetas (\u00a32.6m) a season. The club wanted to let him go last summer, and I think they will try to sell him again this summer - because their long-term policy is to cut wages.' If they do, they can expect another furious response from their fans, many of whom were less than impressed by Redondo's departure. Torres adds: 'McManaman doesn't speak Spanish fluently, but he's a natural communicator and he socialises well. He's expressive, he has charm. Most of the other players - Raul, Figo, Hierro - are dull and serious, but Macca laughs all the time. He changes the atmosphere in the dressing-room.

'Of course I'll miss football incredibly . But who knows what might happen? I might be offered a youth team job at the end of my career or I might just be sent packing. Growler has always said he thinks I'll make a good manager... Could you imagine me and him running Liverpool one day?' Towards 11pm we arrive at a restaurant in central Madrid. A converted theatre designed by Philippe Starck, it is still half-empty. McManaman says it's a beautiful building but he can barely work out the difference between the urinals and the wash basins. His phone rings again and this time it's Robbie Fowler. They talk for five minutes and when he says goodbye, McManaman sports a childish grin. The waiters are too discreet to stare, but they keep looking at him out of the corner of their eyes. He orders pasta with lobster and a steak, then more beers - 'when in Spain, do as the Spanish and have lots to drink' - and shares a cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e with Victoria. Finally, at about 3am, we leave the restaurant. Dido is still on the stereo. McManaman pulls up outside my hotel and gets out to say goodbye. Victoria gets out too, and as 'Thankyou' begins again, she takes her boyfriend by the hand and starts slowly waltzing. A taxi driver looks at this young couple holding each other close on the pavement. Suddenly he recognises one of Real Madrid's star players. He smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.",

For Sanchez's transition from sometime FA Cup final hero with Wimbledon to the latest impressive leader of men at Wycombe carries a deeply personal postscript.<br> In a notoriously demanding profession in which families often take a back seat, he has combined his professional work ethic with dedication to home life as a single parent to son Jack since losing his wife to breast cancer. He copes admirably, but also studiously avoids sympathy: 'It isn't a major achievement what I'm doing. Let's get it in context: I am a single father but I have the benefit that I am financially well paid here. I can afford a cleaner to come in and do my washing and ironing and clean the house up for me.

As a special treat he took Jack to Wycombe's Wimbledon FA Cup tie because it was half term and the first time he would see football under floodlights. When the crowd sung Sanchez's name, Lawrie told Jack they were singing for him, and that he might play there one day. 'It was brilliant. I think the highs are far outweighed by the lows in football and at a moment like that it was nice to be able to share it with him. He's a brilliant kid, and to be fair he's as much a tower of strength to me as I am to him.'<br> This is no flip remark. As his side prepared to finish off his old club after a three-and-half-hour epic, Sanchez did not even watch the dramatic penalties decider - opting to go up into the stands to see his brother and Jack instead. So, the manager of Wycombe Wanderers closes the door of his office at 3pm sharp to go to fetch his five-year-old, philosophical enough to trust that the conundrum of how to solve his striking situation in time for the Leicester game will sort itself out one way or another.<br> Yet he would not have it any other way. Even before that legendary goal in 1988, the header that beat Liverpool to win the Cup, while still in his twenties, Sanchez was planning his route into the dugout.

He had fancied the idea of living in Ireland and decided it would be a good opportunity to quietly learn the trade. His apprenticeship continued back at Wimbledon, with two years coaching the reserves and nurturing the likes of Carl Cort and Jason Euell. When the chance came to continue his ascent at Adams Park, a notable finishing school for what Sanchez calls 'young, thrusting managers', he seized it. So far, he has proved himself an immensely promising successor to Martin O'Neill and John Gregory.<br>'You never know if you're a manager until you have to give your first team-talk,' he reflects. 'Suddenly at half time 11 of your players look to you to sort their problems out for them. I don't think anyone can guarantee they will be a good manager until they have gone through that. I remember it - suddenly it's the real thing. Second bottom of the table, 7,000 fans here, against Kevin Keegan's Fulham who are running away with the league. Solve it! Sort our problems out! Win! We went 1-0 up, then we conceded a goal just before half time through poor marking. I came in and told Terry Evans [assistant manager at the time] to take the team talk as he normally did. Within 10 seconds I said: \"Hang on a minute, this is bollocks. You're doing this wrong, you're doing that wrong.\" Suddenly someone was pointing the finger and telling them to get it right. You could see they jolted back. They went out in the second half and played excellently.'<br> In his second game at Preston, Sanchez was sent off, chucked out, threatened the police and was subsequently banned for six games.

So the fact that he has no recognised striker for the match at Leicester, his club's biggest game yet, should be no trouble. None of his six forwards, he reckons, has a chance of being fit for Saturday. Currently, his front two comprise a midfielder and a young trialist who has had one reserve game.

      "body": "<p>The city of Perth perches on the very edge of Western Australia. The world's most isolated state capital is a well-kept secret in a state so remote that when the world's eyes were turned on this vast continent for the Olympics, TV audiences around the globe barely glimpsed this 'other' Australia.</p> <p>Yet Western Australia offers an astonishing variety of landscapes, climate, flora, fauna, food, wine and people. It covers just under one million square miles, from the steamy tropical North down to the lush, temperate South, and has 7,767 miles of coastline. Whether you sample the tropical charm of Broome, in the far North, the wineries which pepper the Margaret River region in the South or the more cosmopolitan Perth and its maritime sister city Fremantle, you can count on a warm welcome, warm temperatures and exciting things to see and do.</p> <p>International flights arrive in Perth, which makes a good starting-point for any holiday. It cuts a few welcome hours off a very long flight, and many local inhabitants are British migrants, which makes the city feel less alien. Perth, on the banks of the Swan River, is an unthreatening, easy-going city which, despite extensive modernisation, retains a unique antique charm.</p> <p>This old goldrush capital was established in 1869, and today it is a mix of well-preserved old buildings adorned with ornate wrought-ironwork, sheer, shiny skyscrapers and low-rise suburbs stretching for miles.</p> <p>It's a land where the bungalow is king, where only the rich - and Perth is certainly moneyed: just look at the 'Millionaire's Row' district - aspire to an extra storey and every backyard boasts a 'barbie'. A succession of cloudless deep blue skies and balmy weather - Perth has more hours of sunshine than any other Australian city - means that at most restaurants you can dine in the open air. It also helps that some of the world's finest produce is available all year-round: barramundi, snapper and almost every known shellfish abound in the crystal-clear coastal waters. Tender lamb, steak and even emu are popular, all complemented by a mouth-watering menu of home-grown mango, melon and pineapple.</p> <p>Despite an impression that all Australians subsist solely on meat, vegetarianism has caught on hugely in recent years, and veggie restaurants abound in Perth. The ethnic mix of Europeans, Polynesians, Chinese and Asians has created areas such as Northbridge, in the city centre, which offer a feast of disparate cuisines. Add to that a growing caf\u00e9 culture, which in terms of sophistication matches anything you would find in London or New York, and you have a stylish, multicultural urban mix.</p> <p>For a taste of what's on offer, try No 44 King Street, which boasts a superb antipodean wine list and a menu which, astonishingly, combines French, Italian, Japanese, German, Middle Eastern and Australian cuisines. The kangaroo fillet with beetroot remoulade is a speciality.</p> <p>Or you could dine at the CBD restaurant in the Rydges Hotel, in Hay Street which, besides serving an excellent breakfast - including perfectly poached eggs on wedges of sesame bread - has an all-day menu that includes good fresh seafood, especially fine meats and the ubiquitous great coffee.</p> <p>Another suggestion is Valentino, a principally Italian - in Australia there's a fair amount of cultural crossover when it comes to food - eaterie on the corner of James and Lake Streets, in Northbridge, which specialises in fresh fish and shellfish but also runs to some interestingly concocted salads and pasta specials of a high standard.</p> <p>Any stay in Perth must include at least one excursion to the neighbouring port of Fremantle. Known to the natives as 'Fre-o', this bustling town beside the Indian Ocean is best known for hosting the America's Cup yacht race in 1987. Today people flock from miles around to this popular playground with its 'cappuccino strip' in South Terrace, full of chic cafe bars such as Benny's and the newly- opened Madonna, as well as huge, clean, airy pubs such as the Victoria and the bar at the Norfolk Hotel, which serve all the popular brews - VB, Redback, James Boag's - and a respectable pint of Guinness too.</p> <p>Fremantle is the stepping-off point for the car-free resort and nature reserve of Rottnest Island, an 11-mile ferry trip off the coast. 'Rott-o', as it is known to the abbreviation-crazed locals, is a miniature paradise with scalloped bays ideal for spectacular snorkelling, gorgeous sandy beaches and its unique indigenous marsupial, the beaver-like quokka. Trips in the surrounding waters yield good deep sea fishing, whale-watching and sealion-spotting, too.</p> <p>Perth's local strand is the popular Cottesloe Beach, which is good for swimming and surfing pretty much all year round. August is considered chilly, with highs of 18\u00b0C, whereas February is the hottest month, topping 31\u00b0C. Cottesloe is home to many good pubs and beachside restaurants: ideal places to watch the sun go down after a hard day's play. There are plenty of inshore beaches along the Swan River, which are less hectic and often less crowded than those on the Sunset Coast.</p> <p>At the top of the Sunset coastal strip and an easy 30-mile drive from Perth is the district of Yanchep, which contains a national park guaranteed to fascinate and intrigue visitors. It provides an important opportunity to follow a trail through undeveloped Australian bush. The parklands and the lake within them - now crassly renamed Loch McNess by the dunderhead management - are sacred sites of great significance to local Aboriginal people. Fittingly, most of the park staff are Aboriginals: calm, serious people who explain their way of life, show you how their shelters were constructed and their tools were made. Even when they are cradling deceptively dangerous resident koala bears or teaching visitors how to throw a boomerang - invariably the cause of great hilarity - a respectful earnestness informs their manner, which somehow causes you to feel even more inadequate and inferior in the presence of these proud people with their superior knowledge of nature. By the same token, it makes the history of their awful 'civilisation' by the white man even more tragic and shameful.</p> <p>Back in the city, more knowledge about Aboriginal heritage can be gleaned from a visit to shops such as Creative Native, in King Street, which despite its abominable name contains a number of good books on their culture, an array of authentic didgeridoos and baskets of carved emu eggs.</p> <p>Emu-fanciers could do worse than take a trip to Marapana Wildlife World, an hour's drive south of Perth, where they can view these bizarre-looking flightless birds roaming free, along with kangaroos, wallabies, camels and possums, not to mention wattlebirds, bee-eaters, chortling kookaburras and flocks of white-tailed black cockatoos which settle in the eucalyptus trees.</p> <p>It's important for adults and children alike to familiarise themselves with the indigenous wildlife of the continent to understand quite how separate a geographical entity Australia really is.

      "body": "<p>Sydney may attract more attention but Melbourne, a proud, blousy old city, regards itself as the cultural and style capital of Australia. It is also the home of Neighbours, and as a result the inhabitants range between spiky, black-clad fashionistas and the handbag-toting Dame Edna lookalikes who venture in from the sprawling, low-rise suburbs which stretch for miles. </p> <p>As with many Australian metropolises the past still nips at the heels of the present in Melbourne. The broad, awninged streets play host to a cosmopolitan society which demands minimalist restaurants serving modern Australian cuisine of a high standard, chic boutique hotels and the latest designer clothes shops. Echoes of past ages abound, from sightings of descendants of the Aboriginal Koorie people, whose land this once was, to early saloons erected by the European settlers who founded the city in 1835 - lured by the promise of riches in the goldfields of the surrounding state of Victoria - the grandeur of old Flinders Street Station and the later splendours of the first modern department stores.</p> <p>For British visitors Melbourne provides a good starting-point for any antipodean trip, as it is the most European of Australia's cities. It is rich in culture, it possesses a temperate climate and its elegant architecture and municipal parks are reminiscent of, say, a London in miniature - the total population numbers three million - thus lessening the shock of being 14,000 miles away from home. It's a city that really does feel so near, yet so far away.</p> <p><strong>Must see, must do</strong></p> <p><strong>Rialto Towers observation deck</strong><br> 525 Collins St (tel: 9629 8222)<br><a href=\"http://www.rialtoobservationdeck.com.au\">www.rialtoobservationdeck.com.au</a> <br> The deck atop an 830ft skyscraper, the tallest office building in the southern hemisphere, provides the first-time visitor with a spectacular introduction to the size and shape of Melbourne and the Yarra River. There are 360\u00b0 views beyond the Westgate Bridge to the west, the Dandenong Ranges to the east and Port Phillip Bay to the south. Try the website for a taste of a truly remarkable view. Open every day from 10am until late.</p> <p><strong>Melbourne Museum</strong><br> Carlton Gardens, Carlton. (8341 7726)<br><a href=\"http://melbourne.museum.vic.gov.au/\">melbourne.museum.vic.gov.au</a> <br> This state-of-the art museum is a brand-new landmark which oozes national pride. The \u00a3100 million building, designed by Australian-based architects Denton Corker Marshall, is as impressive as the collections it houses. As well as Bunjilaka: the Aboriginal Centre, a brightly coloured Children's Museum, and a Living Forest gallery - which is exactly that - there is a mass of natural history on show, including a blue whale skeleton and the stuffed hide of Phar Lap, the champion racehorse of the Thirties. In addition, Neighbours fans can visit the kitchen set from the Melbourne-based soap and see Kylie's wedding dress. Open 10am-6pm daily. Admission: adults $12; child $3.30; family $16.50.</p> <p><strong>Melbourne Cricket Ground</strong><br> Yarra Park, Jolimont (9657 8888)<br> Australia is the world capital of abbreviations. Thus the MCG has now become known to most Melburnians as simply 'the G'. Host to the first game of Australian Rules Football in 1858 and the other MCC - the Melbourne Cricket Club - since 1853, the stadium is no thing of beauty. However, for sheer atmosphere it is hard to beat. Daily tours include a visit to the members' pavilion (where a slit-window in the gents ensures that members do not miss any play) and an inspection of a vast array of memorabilia in the Cricket Hall of Fame. Open daily 10am-4pm. </p> <p><strong>The Savannah Walkabout, Echidna</strong><br> Walkabout Tours (9646 8249)<br> Adults and children alike will be fascinated by this naturalist-guided eco-tour to Serendip Sanctuary on the Western Plains and the bushlands of Brisbane Ranges National Park. You can see groups of wild kangaroos, emus and wallabies at close range. The birdlife is astonishing: flocks of galahs (grey and pink parrots), cockatoos of all shapes and sizes, petite rainbow lorikeets and strange, sullen nightjars, all in the wild. Helpful guides provide information, and supply bush picnics and eucalyptus tea billy-style with a windmilling arm attached to what looks like an old paint tin. The result is delicious. Duration: One day. Prices: $129 adult, children (under 14) $91. Departures: all year-round.</p> <p><strong>Where to eat and stay</strong></p> <p><strong>Circa, at the Prince Hotel</strong><br> 2 Acland St,St Kilda (9536 1188)<br> Circa is a positively theatrical restaurant in a correspondingly dramatic boutique hotel: all black glass ceilings, sunken courtyards and white leather banquettes. The minimalist rooms are well-appointed and comfortable and many of them contain ultra-stylish furniture by Philippe Starck. Service is discreet and efficient, and every effort is made to preserve the privacy of the guests. Once you get over the Wallpaper magazine-style surroundings of the dining-room, you find yourself in the company of an essentially modern French menu: duck assiette with hazelnut vinaigrette, sage and parmesan crusted veal with artichokes and white wine jus, followed by chocolate souffl\u00e9, petits fours - you know the drill. Chef Michael Lambie describes his cooking as post-classical. Whatever you like to call it, spoil yourselves and go.</p> <p><strong>Hotel Lindrum</strong><br> 26 Flinders St (9668 1111)<br> An elegantly appointed modern hotel in the city centre, the Lindrum is all muted hues of brown, burnt orange and ochre. You could be in some secret, chic establishment on the rive gauche in Paris. The restaurant's floor-to-ceiling glass windows give on to Government House and its gardens. The ambience is all hardwood chairs, upholstered bench seating, white linen, good glass and heavy cutlery. Start with parmesan-battered zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta and fig, try the thyme-marinated quail and move on to mouth-watering main courses, including the Lindrum burger and roasted blue eye with a herb crust on chargrilled asparagus before finishing with an impressive range of Australian cheeses and sumptuous desserts. Expensive but special.</p> <p><strong>Stokehouse</strong><br> 30 Jacka Boulevard, St Kilda (9525 5555)<br> One of Melbourne's most prestigious eateries, this fashionable seaside venue is divided into two restaurants: a caf\u00e9 and bar downstairs and a more exclusive affair upstairs which affords spectacular views over Port Phillip Bay to those diners who can afford prices in a different league. The cuisine is modern Australian with French touches. Highly recommended: the blue swimmer crab with a ginger, chilli and sake and shellfish dressing. Downstairs is almost always full, but it's worth waiting in the queue as the food - wood-fired pizzas, fresh shellfish and pastas of every hue - is delicious and good value.</p> <p><strong>Caffe e Cucina</strong><br> 581 Chapel St, South Yarra (9827 4139)<br> Another important feature in the city's culinary landscape, this is an old Italian restaurant, more reminiscent of the Italian-American variety to be found in New York than its European cousins: too much banter between staff being conducted obviously and deliberately in Italian. The food, on the other hand, is very good: cotoletta alla milanese (veal in breadcrumbs) and scottadito d'agnello (lamb cutlets) warrant high praise, as does the panna cotta. If there are two of you dining and you want the ultimate romantic experience, ask for the outside balcony upstairs.</p> <p><strong>Bars and caf\u00e9s</strong></p> <p><strong>Caf\u00e9 Andiamo</strong><br> 36-38 Degraves Street (9650 8060)<br> A typical example of the city's many multicultural manifestations, this busy Italian caf\u00e9 is run by a Chinese family, who provide a selection of reasonably priced, freshly made pizzas and pastas. Ideal for a quick lunch on a shopping tour of the city's exciting warren of Victorian arcades.</p> <p><strong>Caf\u00e9 Cakes</strong><br> 278 Smith St, Collingwood (9416 0336)<br> Mountains of muffins (gluten-free and otherwise), delicious home-made muesli and a spectacular range of pastries and cakes make this airy caf\u00e9 the perfect place for breakfast in the sunshine. An exotic, extensive range of teas, herbal and otherwise is complemented by a choice of coffees, of which the best is the traditional Australian flat white (a milky filter coffee).</p> <p><strong>Pellegrini's</strong><br> 66 Bourke St, City (9662 1885)<br> The authentic Italian feel of this dark, cosy bar provides a charming antique reminder of the Mediterranean origins of much of Melbourne's population. Try the strong Vittoria coffee, the excellent pastas in traditional sauces and, slightly non-Italian, the home-baked strudel (extra cream a must). One of the city's most venerable institutions.</p> <p><strong>Savi</strong><br> Midlevel, Southgate, Southbank (9699 3600)<br> Unpretentious, panelled wine bar and restaurant which serves good modern Australian cuisine accompanied by helpful, if occasionally slow, service. A well-selected wine-list contains, even for mind-bogglingly wine-literate Australians, several interesting surprises. Conveniently located in the attractive Southbank arts complex, this is an ideal venue for a pre-theatre dinner or drink. It's especially popular at festival times, in May and October, so make sure you book.</p> <p><strong>Shopping</strong></p> <p><strong>Collette Dinnigan</strong><br> 553 Chapel St, South Yarra (9827 2111)<br> Nicole Kidman s favourite frock shop now has a UK branch in the West End of London, but try this boutique in the chic Chapel Street district for all the latest dresses, slips and lingerie at non-West End prices.

      "bodyText": "Sydney may attract more attention but Melbourne, a proud, blousy old city, regards itself as the cultural and style capital of Australia. It is also the home of Neighbours, and as a result the inhabitants range between spiky, black-clad fashionistas and the handbag-toting Dame Edna lookalikes who venture in from the sprawling, low-rise suburbs which stretch for miles. As with many Australian metropolises the past still nips at the heels of the present in Melbourne. The broad, awninged streets play host to a cosmopolitan society which demands minimalist restaurants serving modern Australian cuisine of a high standard, chic boutique hotels and the latest designer clothes shops. Echoes of past ages abound, from sightings of descendants of the Aboriginal Koorie people, whose land this once was, to early saloons erected by the European settlers who founded the city in 1835 - lured by the promise of riches in the goldfields of the surrounding state of Victoria - the grandeur of old Flinders Street Station and the later splendours of the first modern department stores. For British visitors Melbourne provides a good starting-point for any antipodean trip, as it is the most European of Australia's cities. It is rich in culture, it possesses a temperate climate and its elegant architecture and municipal parks are reminiscent of, say, a London in miniature - the total population numbers three million - thus lessening the shock of being 14,000 miles away from home. It's a city that really does feel so near, yet so far away. Must see, must do Rialto Towers observation deck 525 Collins St (tel: 9629 8222) www.rialtoobservationdeck.com.au The deck atop an 830ft skyscraper, the tallest office building in the southern hemisphere, provides the first-time visitor with a spectacular introduction to the size and shape of Melbourne and the Yarra River. There are 360\u00b0 views beyond the Westgate Bridge to the west, the Dandenong Ranges to the east and Port Phillip Bay to the south. Try the website for a taste of a truly remarkable view. Open every day from 10am until late. Melbourne Museum Carlton Gardens, Carlton. (8341 7726) melbourne.museum.vic.gov.au This state-of-the art museum is a brand-new landmark which oozes national pride. The \u00a3100 million building, designed by Australian-based architects Denton Corker Marshall, is as impressive as the collections it houses. As well as Bunjilaka: the Aboriginal Centre, a brightly coloured Children's Museum, and a Living Forest gallery - which is exactly that - there is a mass of natural history on show, including a blue whale skeleton and the stuffed hide of Phar Lap, the champion racehorse of the Thirties. In addition, Neighbours fans can visit the kitchen set from the Melbourne-based soap and see Kylie's wedding dress. Open 10am-6pm daily. Admission: adults $12; child $3.30; family $16.50. Melbourne Cricket Ground Yarra Park, Jolimont (9657 8888) Australia is the world capital of abbreviations. Thus the MCG has now become known to most Melburnians as simply 'the G'. Host to the first game of Australian Rules Football in 1858 and the other MCC - the Melbourne Cricket Club - since 1853, the stadium is no thing of beauty. However, for sheer atmosphere it is hard to beat. Daily tours include a visit to the members' pavilion (where a slit-window in the gents ensures that members do not miss any play) and an inspection of a vast array of memorabilia in the Cricket Hall of Fame. Open daily 10am-4pm. The Savannah Walkabout, Echidna Walkabout Tours (9646 8249) Adults and children alike will be fascinated by this naturalist-guided eco-tour to Serendip Sanctuary on the Western Plains and the bushlands of Brisbane Ranges National Park. You can see groups of wild kangaroos, emus and wallabies at close range. The birdlife is astonishing: flocks of galahs (grey and pink parrots), cockatoos of all shapes and sizes, petite rainbow lorikeets and strange, sullen nightjars, all in the wild. Helpful guides provide information, and supply bush picnics and eucalyptus tea billy-style with a windmilling arm attached to what looks like an old paint tin. The result is delicious. Duration: One day. Prices: $129 adult, children (under 14) $91. Departures: all year-round. Where to eat and stay Circa, at the Prince Hotel 2 Acland St,St Kilda (9536 1188) Circa is a positively theatrical restaurant in a correspondingly dramatic boutique hotel: all black glass ceilings, sunken courtyards and white leather banquettes. The minimalist rooms are well-appointed and comfortable and many of them contain ultra-stylish furniture by Philippe Starck. Service is discreet and efficient, and every effort is made to preserve the privacy of the guests. Once you get over the Wallpaper magazine-style surroundings of the dining-room, you find yourself in the company of an essentially modern French menu: duck assiette with hazelnut vinaigrette, sage and parmesan crusted veal with artichokes and white wine jus, followed by chocolate souffl\u00e9, petits fours - you know the drill. Chef Michael Lambie describes his cooking as post-classical. Whatever you like to call it, spoil yourselves and go. Hotel Lindrum 26 Flinders St (9668 1111) An elegantly appointed modern hotel in the city centre, the Lindrum is all muted hues of brown, burnt orange and ochre. You could be in some secret, chic establishment on the rive gauche in Paris. The restaurant's floor-to-ceiling glass windows give on to Government House and its gardens. The ambience is all hardwood chairs, upholstered bench seating, white linen, good glass and heavy cutlery. Start with parmesan-battered zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta and fig, try the thyme-marinated quail and move on to mouth-watering main courses, including the Lindrum burger and roasted blue eye with a herb crust on chargrilled asparagus before finishing with an impressive range of Australian cheeses and sumptuous desserts. Expensive but special. Stokehouse 30 Jacka Boulevard, St Kilda (9525 5555) One of Melbourne's most prestigious eateries, this fashionable seaside venue is divided into two restaurants: a caf\u00e9 and bar downstairs and a more exclusive affair upstairs which affords spectacular views over Port Phillip Bay to those diners who can afford prices in a different league. The cuisine is modern Australian with French touches. Highly recommended: the blue swimmer crab with a ginger, chilli and sake and shellfish dressing. Downstairs is almost always full, but it's worth waiting in the queue as the food - wood-fired pizzas, fresh shellfish and pastas of every hue - is delicious and good value. Caffe e Cucina 581 Chapel St, South Yarra (9827 4139) Another important feature in the city's culinary landscape, this is an old Italian restaurant, more reminiscent of the Italian-American variety to be found in New York than its European cousins: too much banter between staff being conducted obviously and deliberately in Italian. The food, on the other hand, is very good: cotoletta alla milanese (veal in breadcrumbs) and scottadito d'agnello (lamb cutlets) warrant high praise, as does the panna cotta. If there are two of you dining and you want the ultimate romantic experience, ask for the outside balcony upstairs. Bars and caf\u00e9s Caf\u00e9 Andiamo 36-38 Degraves Street (9650 8060) A typical example of the city's many multicultural manifestations, this busy Italian caf\u00e9 is run by a Chinese family, who provide a selection of reasonably priced, freshly made pizzas and pastas. Ideal for a quick lunch on a shopping tour of the city's exciting warren of Victorian arcades. Caf\u00e9 Cakes 278 Smith St, Collingwood (9416 0336) Mountains of muffins (gluten-free and otherwise), delicious home-made muesli and a spectacular range of pastries and cakes make this airy caf\u00e9 the perfect place for breakfast in the sunshine. An exotic, extensive range of teas, herbal and otherwise is complemented by a choice of coffees, of which the best is the traditional Australian flat white (a milky filter coffee). Pellegrini's 66 Bourke St, City (9662 1885) The authentic Italian feel of this dark, cosy bar provides a charming antique reminder of the Mediterranean origins of much of Melbourne's population. Try the strong Vittoria coffee, the excellent pastas in traditional sauces and, slightly non-Italian, the home-baked strudel (extra cream a must). One of the city's most venerable institutions. Savi Midlevel, Southgate, Southbank (9699 3600) Unpretentious, panelled wine bar and restaurant which serves good modern Australian cuisine accompanied by helpful, if occasionally slow, service. A well-selected wine-list contains, even for mind-bogglingly wine-literate Australians, several interesting surprises. Conveniently located in the attractive Southbank arts complex, this is an ideal venue for a pre-theatre dinner or drink. It's especially popular at festival times, in May and October, so make sure you book. Shopping Collette Dinnigan 553 Chapel St, South Yarra (9827 2111) Nicole Kidman s favourite frock shop now has a UK branch in the West End of London, but try this boutique in the chic Chapel Street district for all the latest dresses, slips and lingerie at non-West End prices. This year's collection is a riot of soft pinks, damsons and dark, dark greens, invariably ornamented with Dinnigan's delicate signature lacework. Akubra Hats 64 Charter St, Ringwood (9879 5866) The Akubra (from the Aboriginal word meaning head-covering) is the traditional Australian man's broad-brimmed hat - you saw them sported by all those Olympic officials in Sydney - which comes in many different shapes, sizes and colours, with macho names such as Cattleman and Snowy River. The felt from which the hats are made contains a high proportion of under-fur from wild rabbits, thus apparently increasing the quality and comfort of the material. They are less expensive than you might think: you can purchase a good one for around \u00a320. David Jones 310 Bourke St, City (9643 2222) Part of a popular Australian department store chain with more than a whiff of Grace Brothers about it. Floor upon floor of affordable food and fashion, an antipodean Harvey Nicks without the attitude or the Patsies and Edinas, though you may spot the occasional diamante-bespectacled Dame Edna giving vent to cries of outrage in the lingerie department. Intelligent buying, old-fashioned, helpful service - but no Mrs Slocombes - and good value make this store attractive. St Kilda Craft Market Upper Esplanade, St Kilda A visit to this market is a weekend ritual for thousands. It is open on Sundays between 10am and 5pm. Take a lazy wander around the stalls, eat at a street caf\u00e9, walk on the beach, watching the street entertainers - then begin your real shopping expedition.

      "byline": "Paul Wilson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Amid all the breast-beating and xenophobic ranting that greeted the appointment of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson as England coach, one comment from an exceptionally shrewd and well-qualified observer cut through the nonsense to the heart of the matter. 'At last,' said Brian Clough. 'England have a manager who speaks better English than the players.' <br> There is a growing realisation within the media that he is not going to speak much of it - Italian journalists dubbed him 'the rubber wall' because every teasing question came bouncing back - but even at this early stage it is evident the new man communicates effectively with his players.<br> 'They are a very educated group,' Eriksson said, selecting a compliment unlikely to have been volunteered by any of his English predecessors. 'I found their attitude very professional.' <br>The players will not worry that Eriksson does not talk the hind leg off a donkey like Graham Taylor, chew the fat like Terry Venables, or talk himself into trouble like Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan. To a greater or lesser degree, all those managers were pursued and eventually pilloried by the media, a fate from which Eriksson may not be immune if England drop vital points in the next two World Cup qualifiers. Everything is sweetness and light after the impressive 3-0 victory over Spain, though one only has to think back to the rapture that greeted Keegan's opening 3-1 win against Poland to appreciate how quickly the picture can change. <br> Eriksson understands that, of course, but he also understands that the language of international management is not always transferable to newsprint. The papers may find his quotes anodyne, but the mark of a clever manager is not necessarily what he says. It is also what he does not say. <br> Erikkson is certainly the cleverest England manager since Venables, whose celebrated cuteness was based on a solid grasp of technicalities and an easy familiarity with players and media alike. Yet even Venables, who presided over a series of yawnful friendlies before Euro 96, might have struggled to dispel the gloom surrounding English football as quickly and deliberately.<br> Maybe this is to claim too much for Eriksson. February friendlies against teams from warm countries are never reliable guides, and it is possible it is merely the uniqueness of Eriksson's situation that has enabled him to make a fresh start. There cannot be an English manager anywhere in the league, for instance, who could have predicted two weeks ago that Eriksson would start his first game with Phil Neville and Chris Powell at full back. Similarly, there were times against Spain, notably when England had four strikers on the field in Nick Barmby, Andy Cole, Emile Heskey and Michael Owen, when the thought occurred that Keegan would never have dared risk such an attacking line-up.

      "bodyText": "Amid all the breast-beating and xenophobic ranting that greeted the appointment of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson as England coach, one comment from an exceptionally shrewd and well-qualified observer cut through the nonsense to the heart of the matter. 'At last,' said Brian Clough. 'England have a manager who speaks better English than the players.' There is a growing realisation within the media that he is not going to speak much of it - Italian journalists dubbed him 'the rubber wall' because every teasing question came bouncing back - but even at this early stage it is evident the new man communicates effectively with his players. 'They are a very educated group,' Eriksson said, selecting a compliment unlikely to have been volunteered by any of his English predecessors. 'I found their attitude very professional.' The players will not worry that Eriksson does not talk the hind leg off a donkey like Graham Taylor, chew the fat like Terry Venables, or talk himself into trouble like Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan. To a greater or lesser degree, all those managers were pursued and eventually pilloried by the media, a fate from which Eriksson may not be immune if England drop vital points in the next two World Cup qualifiers. Everything is sweetness and light after the impressive 3-0 victory over Spain, though one only has to think back to the rapture that greeted Keegan's opening 3-1 win against Poland to appreciate how quickly the picture can change. Eriksson understands that, of course, but he also understands that the language of international management is not always transferable to newsprint. The papers may find his quotes anodyne, but the mark of a clever manager is not necessarily what he says. It is also what he does not say. Erikkson is certainly the cleverest England manager since Venables, whose celebrated cuteness was based on a solid grasp of technicalities and an easy familiarity with players and media alike. Yet even Venables, who presided over a series of yawnful friendlies before Euro 96, might have struggled to dispel the gloom surrounding English football as quickly and deliberately. Maybe this is to claim too much for Eriksson. February friendlies against teams from warm countries are never reliable guides, and it is possible it is merely the uniqueness of Eriksson's situation that has enabled him to make a fresh start. There cannot be an English manager anywhere in the league, for instance, who could have predicted two weeks ago that Eriksson would start his first game with Phil Neville and Chris Powell at full back. Similarly, there were times against Spain, notably when England had four strikers on the field in Nick Barmby, Andy Cole, Emile Heskey and Michael Owen, when the thought occurred that Keegan would never have dared risk such an attacking line-up. Mainly because he would have had to have Alan Shearer out there as well. Significantly, Eriksson apologised afterwards for using Heskey slightly out of position, wide on the right. Keegan was undone by playing people out of position. He tried a variety of square pegs in the gaping round hole of left wing, and famously could not think of an alternative left-back to the right-footed Phil Neville.

      "body": "<p>I very much doubt that Tony Blair is capable of sexing a chicken. And I'm equally sceptical that William Hague can diagnose the difference between swine fever and foot and mouth. The current emergency demands that they pretend to possess a longstanding and developed comprehension of animal husbandry, but food is usually of interest to most politicians only when it is presented on a menu. As an issue, it rarely tingles the taste buds of the governing class.</p> <p>People of ambition and talent do not enter the House of Commons plotting to bring their career to a pinnacle with a spell wading around in manure, being shouted at by angry farmers. So puny is the standing of the Minister of Agriculture in the Westminster animal kingdom that the holder of the post does not even enjoy the dignity of being called Secretary of State. Successive Prime Ministers, reflecting the indifference of the electorate to how their daily grub is produced and delivered, have treated the position as the nether end of the Cabinet's biological chain. The department is traditionally regarded as a holding pen in which to park older and declining colleagues before they are finally carted off to the knacker's yard.</p> <p>I have spent some years listening to the private lusts and fears of Members of Parliament, conversations which often occur over lunch or dinner. Not once has a politician stopped munching to declare a burning desire to take control of the commanding heights of Maff. You might expect the muddier tracts of Britain not to greatly interest urban New Labour, but it is also broadly true of the farmers' supposed party, the Conservatives. Only last week, I was discussing his prospects with one of the brighter lights of the Tory front bench. He candidly acknowledged the vast odds against his party returning to power in the foreseeable future, but he still saw satisfaction from being in Opposition. There was only this qualification: 'If William asked me to do Agriculture, I'd tell him I had other plans for the rest of my life.'</p> <p>The present incumbent, Nick Brown, has had to live with colleagues branding his rump for speedy dispatch to the Westminster slaughterhouse. He was the most important victim of Tony Blair's first reshuffle, mainly on account of his tightness with his ally and namesake, Gordon Brown. The Prime Minister exiled Nick Brown from the role he loved, that of Chief Whip, to the Siberian tundra of Agriculture. According to some believable accounts, this was punishment so cruel that it reduced Mr Brown to tears. It was widely assumed that, in the cull of the Cabinet that will follow the election, he was tagged for the Downing Street equivalent of the one-shot bolt to the head.</p> <p>That view is now being revised. The Agriculture Minister's handling of the foot-and-mouth emergency has drawn praise even from his opponents. Apart from one lapse, when he suggested that he had better things to do than answer to Parliament, he has impressed. That stolidly bovine face, his patient and technical explanations of what has to be done to control and eradicate the disease, along with his evident dedication to the task, have made Mr Brown a more reassuring character to have in charge of this episode than some of the Cabinet's flashier figures.</p> <p>Overall, the Government has had a reasonably good crisis so far. The brutal truth, pitiless though this must seem to the farmers who are heaping their livestock on to the funeral pyres, is that the only aspect of this emergency for the countryside that truly terrifies Ministers is the threat of shops in the towns running out of food. The urgency with which they have implored urban shoppers not to panic-buy indicates their own panic about the shelves being empty of meat. So long as the crisis is confined to rural areas, where it has deep effects but only on a tiny proportion of the population, it will swing few, if any, votes among the vast majority who dwell in suburb and city. The prospect of food shortages has already receded with Friday's announcement that livestock licensed as disease-free can be moved about.</p> <p>I think it highly unlikely that the cordons sanitaires thrown around some farmland will influence either the timing or the outcome of the election. It will take an outbreak of bubonic plague to budge New Labour off the 3 May battle grid. Nor is there any indication that the glowing night skies in the countryside will have any impact on the result. The Conservatives have searched, and thus far failed, to find ways of making political capital. At Question Time, William Hague was reduced to interrogating the Prime Minister about the adequacy of the stocks of disinfectant. I half-wondered whether, in his desperation to sound statesmanly and responsible, the Tory leader was going to move on to inquire about supplies of green wellies.</p> <p>In medieval warfare, it was common practice to lob the carcasses of diseased animals into an enemy fortress. Much as they itch to deploy the same tactic against the Government, the Tories have not dared to load their catapults with blistered pig and cow for fear that the diseased animals will boomerang back on to their own lines. Before foot and mouth, Britain has already had an expensive education in the consequences of intensive, industrial agriculture. It was mad cow disease which forever destroyed the reputation of benignly bucolic Old MacDonald and replaced him in the public mind with the disease-spreading agro-businessman. And it happened under the Tories' supervision of the farm gate.</p> <p>The leader of the opposition likes to strike a pose as the son of the Rother Valley, the farmers' friend. At his party's spring conference in Harrogate today, Mr Hague may be tempted to suggest a contrast between his empathy for rural folk and those metropolitan New Labourites. In a recent documentary, we saw him and Ffion rambling the Yorkshire Moors and sinking pints in country pubs. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition enjoys the fresh air. I am almost as certain that, before he became MP for a large chunk of countryside in God's own county, Mr Hague did not know one end of a pig from the other. He is the scion of a fizzy drinks manufacturer who graduated into management consultancy. Mr Hague spent his youth not coddling cows, but swotting Hansard.</p> <p>I don't hold that against him. It simply means that Mr Hague is much the same as Mr Blair and the vast majority of MPs. They are urban and suburban, just like the great bulk of people in Britain. Rural folk are quite correct to say that townies are pretty clueless about what really goes on in the countryside. But I am not certain they will enjoy the consequences if the urban population becomes seriously inquiring about what happens to their food between leaving the farm and entering their mouths.</p> <p>The one sliver of silver in the acrid clouds of burning carcasses is that we may finally have a searching national conversation about the high price we are paying for cheap, over-processed, chemically-manipulated, flavourless, disease-prone food. As tends to be the case with Tony Blair - and, to be fair, with most Prime Ministers - it has taken a crisis to grab his attention. He has taken a populist swipe at the rapacity of the supermarkets.

      "bodyText": "I very much doubt that Tony Blair is capable of sexing a chicken. And I'm equally sceptical that William Hague can diagnose the difference between swine fever and foot and mouth. The current emergency demands that they pretend to possess a longstanding and developed comprehension of animal husbandry, but food is usually of interest to most politicians only when it is presented on a menu. As an issue, it rarely tingles the taste buds of the governing class. People of ambition and talent do not enter the House of Commons plotting to bring their career to a pinnacle with a spell wading around in manure, being shouted at by angry farmers. So puny is the standing of the Minister of Agriculture in the Westminster animal kingdom that the holder of the post does not even enjoy the dignity of being called Secretary of State. Successive Prime Ministers, reflecting the indifference of the electorate to how their daily grub is produced and delivered, have treated the position as the nether end of the Cabinet's biological chain. The department is traditionally regarded as a holding pen in which to park older and declining colleagues before they are finally carted off to the knacker's yard. I have spent some years listening to the private lusts and fears of Members of Parliament, conversations which often occur over lunch or dinner. Not once has a politician stopped munching to declare a burning desire to take control of the commanding heights of Maff. You might expect the muddier tracts of Britain not to greatly interest urban New Labour, but it is also broadly true of the farmers' supposed party, the Conservatives. Only last week, I was discussing his prospects with one of the brighter lights of the Tory front bench. He candidly acknowledged the vast odds against his party returning to power in the foreseeable future, but he still saw satisfaction from being in Opposition. There was only this qualification: 'If William asked me to do Agriculture, I'd tell him I had other plans for the rest of my life.' The present incumbent, Nick Brown, has had to live with colleagues branding his rump for speedy dispatch to the Westminster slaughterhouse. He was the most important victim of Tony Blair's first reshuffle, mainly on account of his tightness with his ally and namesake, Gordon Brown. The Prime Minister exiled Nick Brown from the role he loved, that of Chief Whip, to the Siberian tundra of Agriculture. According to some believable accounts, this was punishment so cruel that it reduced Mr Brown to tears. It was widely assumed that, in the cull of the Cabinet that will follow the election, he was tagged for the Downing Street equivalent of the one-shot bolt to the head. That view is now being revised. The Agriculture Minister's handling of the foot-and-mouth emergency has drawn praise even from his opponents. Apart from one lapse, when he suggested that he had better things to do than answer to Parliament, he has impressed. That stolidly bovine face, his patient and technical explanations of what has to be done to control and eradicate the disease, along with his evident dedication to the task, have made Mr Brown a more reassuring character to have in charge of this episode than some of the Cabinet's flashier figures. Overall, the Government has had a reasonably good crisis so far. The brutal truth, pitiless though this must seem to the farmers who are heaping their livestock on to the funeral pyres, is that the only aspect of this emergency for the countryside that truly terrifies Ministers is the threat of shops in the towns running out of food. The urgency with which they have implored urban shoppers not to panic-buy indicates their own panic about the shelves being empty of meat. So long as the crisis is confined to rural areas, where it has deep effects but only on a tiny proportion of the population, it will swing few, if any, votes among the vast majority who dwell in suburb and city. The prospect of food shortages has already receded with Friday's announcement that livestock licensed as disease-free can be moved about. I think it highly unlikely that the cordons sanitaires thrown around some farmland will influence either the timing or the outcome of the election. It will take an outbreak of bubonic plague to budge New Labour off the 3 May battle grid. Nor is there any indication that the glowing night skies in the countryside will have any impact on the result. The Conservatives have searched, and thus far failed, to find ways of making political capital. At Question Time, William Hague was reduced to interrogating the Prime Minister about the adequacy of the stocks of disinfectant. I half-wondered whether, in his desperation to sound statesmanly and responsible, the Tory leader was going to move on to inquire about supplies of green wellies. In medieval warfare, it was common practice to lob the carcasses of diseased animals into an enemy fortress. Much as they itch to deploy the same tactic against the Government, the Tories have not dared to load their catapults with blistered pig and cow for fear that the diseased animals will boomerang back on to their own lines. Before foot and mouth, Britain has already had an expensive education in the consequences of intensive, industrial agriculture. It was mad cow disease which forever destroyed the reputation of benignly bucolic Old MacDonald and replaced him in the public mind with the disease-spreading agro-businessman. And it happened under the Tories' supervision of the farm gate. The leader of the opposition likes to strike a pose as the son of the Rother Valley, the farmers' friend. At his party's spring conference in Harrogate today, Mr Hague may be tempted to suggest a contrast between his empathy for rural folk and those metropolitan New Labourites. In a recent documentary, we saw him and Ffion rambling the Yorkshire Moors and sinking pints in country pubs. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition enjoys the fresh air. I am almost as certain that, before he became MP for a large chunk of countryside in God's own county, Mr Hague did not know one end of a pig from the other. He is the scion of a fizzy drinks manufacturer who graduated into management consultancy. Mr Hague spent his youth not coddling cows, but swotting Hansard. I don't hold that against him. It simply means that Mr Hague is much the same as Mr Blair and the vast majority of MPs. They are urban and suburban, just like the great bulk of people in Britain. Rural folk are quite correct to say that townies are pretty clueless about what really goes on in the countryside. But I am not certain they will enjoy the consequences if the urban population becomes seriously inquiring about what happens to their food between leaving the farm and entering their mouths. The one sliver of silver in the acrid clouds of burning carcasses is that we may finally have a searching national conversation about the high price we are paying for cheap, over-processed, chemically-manipulated, flavourless, disease-prone food. As tends to be the case with Tony Blair - and, to be fair, with most Prime Ministers - it has taken a crisis to grab his attention. He has taken a populist swipe at the rapacity of the supermarkets. The Government is suddenly buzzing with conversation that food production and distribution must be radically changed. Mr Blair declares he wants a great national debate. We will see if this commitment and interest lasts or whether it will be forgotten once the bonfires have gone out. I will know when the political class is really interested in grappling with all the dilemmas and choices thrown up by this latest farming crisis. It will be when a thrusting politician puts down his fork, leans over the lunch table, drops his voice to a confidential whisper and declares that his consuming ambition is to reform the way we eat.

      "body": "<p>To the mandarins of the Treasury it seemed a bizarre request. Could all notes to the Chancellor of the Exchequer please include home telephone numbers. The Chancellor likes to read papers between 6am and 7.30am, his office explained, before coming into the department. He needs to be able to get to any official while they're digesting their morning toast.</p> <p>Over the past two weeks, Brown and his tight entourage of staff have been in what officials describe as 'Budget blitz' mode. From 6am Brown is on the telephone. With his two special advisers, Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, he has been worrying away, grinding the figures, totting up the advantages and disadvantages of a tweak here, a tweak there.</p> <p>How will the latest details on increasing maternity pay work? How will widening the 10p tax band be made to look like a tax cut for everybody? How much will a family on average earnings of \u00a325,000 be better off if all the tax and benefit changes kick in on 5 April? About \u00a3370, Gordon, came the reply.</p> <p>It is a punishing schedule. At 7.30am his car arrives for the short journey from the Westminster home he shares with wife Sarah Macaulay to the Treasury. There he continues his machinations, banging out his thoughts on a laptop in large block capitals, all the more easy to read for a man with poor eyesight.</p> <p>Sometimes his secretary brings in a projector. Brown's laptop thoughts are beamed onto a screen so that Balls and Miliband can see what he is writing, his Budget speech the centre of attention. No one else is in the room, a smaller, more private study off the original cavernous office Brown first occupied.</p> <p>They bash phrases backwards and forwards - what will tickle the party, what will tickle the nation? - the loyalty of his two trusted lieutenants unquestioned. Not for Brown the process established by his predecessors. It is not officials who draft the Budget speech but the Chancellor himself.</p> <p>Balls is the chief economic adviser to the Treasury. He is the channel through which every minute passes, and he has succeeded in outmanoeuvring the civil servants to ensure that his master's will is done. Brown and Balls hate endless memos. They keep their thoughts in their heads and in Brown's computer. It's safer that way. Not for nothing is Balls nicknamed the deputy chancellor.</p> <p>The other Ed is the brother of David Miliband, head of the Downing Street policy unit. But even the family link is not enough to allow No 10 a peek at Brown's detailed thinking. The Chancellor ensures that the Prime Minister is kept up with the broad themes, but the details are under wraps until the last minute. Other members of the Cabinet are not told about their specific areas of spending until a few days before the big day.</p> <p>The Cabinet as a whole will have to wait until Wednesday morning to hear about the Budget speech. They received a note last month from Downing Street saying Blair had moved the weekly Cabinet meeting forward to next Wednesday morning so that Brown could tell them what was going on. Five hours later Brown will get up in the House of Commons, pile up a set of books so that he can rest his speech high enough for him to see it and tell the nation what he is up to.</p> <p>The Chancellor is not a man for formal meetings. Recent relations between the Chancellor's and Prime Minister's teams have improved, but the tension remains. Brown sees the Treasury as the natural headquarters of economic and social policy. Blair wants to concentrate power in No 10, the Policy Unit and the Cabinet Secretariat. The Treasury - tight-knit, secretive, ferociously intelligent - is winning the battle.</p> <p>Thanks to a series of judiciously timed leaks, it is now becoming clear where Brown's priorities lie. Women, the voters Labour fears are most disillusioned with Tony Blair the politician and New Labour the Government, are to be wooed like never before.</p> <p>Maternity pay will be boosted, rules on how many tax benefits new parents can claim will be relaxed, benefits for families with children will be increased. And the new Labour worry, Mrs Mortgage, will be told that interest rates and mortgage repayments are at their lowest for years. Everything, from a reduction in stamp duty for new homes in deprived areas to boosts for single parents, will be given a family-friendly edge.</p> <p>It has all been planned with meticulous care. In 1998 Brown started plotting the route to the next election, fixed already in his mind as May 2001. Each year the Budget has had slightly more to give away, culminating in the Treasury's 'red-letter day', 5 April 2001.</p> <p>On that day, in a month's time, a series of tax and benefit changes will kick in. Pensions will increase, rules on how much money the elderly can save before they have to pay for their own care will be relaxed, child benefit will increase, road tax will be cut for millions of cars, tax credits aimed at those earning under \u00a340,000 will be launched.</p> <p>Poorer families will be up to \u00a32,600 a year better off. Tax cuts through the increase in the 10p income tax band will mean everyone has a little more in their pocket. An election will be called. Blair will win. Brown will be the man behind it. Perfect.</p> <p>The procession of high-heels clicking across the varnished floorboards upstairs at No 11 Downing Street shortly after the last two Budgets were the first sign. Over the white wine and canap\u00e9s, Brown struggled manfully to make small talk with magazine editors anxious to know where he bought his suits.</p> <p>Sarah Macaulay circled among guests ranging from female MPs and journalists to prominent women such as Germaine Greer and even Cherie Booth.</p> <p>But as with everything Brown does, there was a carefully calculated point to it all - to show that the Chancellor sympathised with women.</p> <p>It underlined a message the Budgets had already made clear with promises of massive increases in childcare places, tax breaks for working women to pay for those childcare places, even the scrapping of VAT on sanitary products last year, a matter so embarrassing to the Chancellor that he failed to mention it in his speech and left it to a junior Minister to brief journalists afterwards.</p> <p>Labour campaign strategists have identified Mrs Mortgage as the woman they have to woo. Middle England, middle income, hard-working, she will be the target of the election campaign. She was picked after research revealed that it was women who were least impressed with the Government's multi-billion pound economic arguments and felt that Labour had failed to be as modernising at it had claimed it would be.</p> <p>The Chancellor has taken this on board, despite his predominantly male core of advisers. Helping him to win Mrs Mortgage's trust are Harriet Harman, an old Brown ally and former Minister, Maeve Sherlock, the former head of the National Council of One Parent Families, and Treasury ministers Dawn Primarolo and Melanie Johnson.</p> <p>Primarolo and Johnson have linked up with the two Women's Ministers, Tessa Jowell and Margaret Jay. It was Primarolo, once a struggling single mother herself, who fought for the children's tax credit to be drawn by mothers as well as fathers, following fears that in some households it would never be spent on the children.</p> <p>But there have been some hiccups for Brown. This week's announcement on maternity pay follows intense haggling between his officials and the women's lobby: the Chancellor favoured targeting help on poor new mothers, arguing that wealthy women earning large salaries did not need the state to top up their bank balances when they gave birth. But he has relented and will announce on Wednesday that the state will provide maternity pay for all, with a likely top-up for those most in need through extra tax credits.</p> <p>Brown is acutely aware that Labour's election hopes will be heavily dependent on his performance in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Party officials know that if the public are not convinced, then the chances of another huge majority could suffer, even though some opinion polls are already predicting such an outcome on 3 May, which is still the favoured date for a poll.</p> <p>Other reports: <br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445997,00.html\">Family fortunes</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446002,00.html\">Don't scare the horses in the City</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445996,00.html\">Giving credit where tax credit's due</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445995,00.html\">Now, will the real Gordon Brown please stand up?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446004,00.html\">When prudence turns dangerous</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446003,00.html\">Gordon's tonic: the hot tips</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446179,00.html\">Is Labour aiming at you?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446180,00.html\">More cash and time off for mothers</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446178,00.html\">Mr Brown, Mr Balls and the elusive Mrs Mortgage</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "To the mandarins of the Treasury it seemed a bizarre request. Could all notes to the Chancellor of the Exchequer please include home telephone numbers. The Chancellor likes to read papers between 6am and 7.30am, his office explained, before coming into the department. He needs to be able to get to any official while they're digesting their morning toast. Over the past two weeks, Brown and his tight entourage of staff have been in what officials describe as 'Budget blitz' mode. From 6am Brown is on the telephone. With his two special advisers, Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, he has been worrying away, grinding the figures, totting up the advantages and disadvantages of a tweak here, a tweak there. How will the latest details on increasing maternity pay work? How will widening the 10p tax band be made to look like a tax cut for everybody? How much will a family on average earnings of \u00a325,000 be better off if all the tax and benefit changes kick in on 5 April? About \u00a3370, Gordon, came the reply. It is a punishing schedule. At 7.30am his car arrives for the short journey from the Westminster home he shares with wife Sarah Macaulay to the Treasury. There he continues his machinations, banging out his thoughts on a laptop in large block capitals, all the more easy to read for a man with poor eyesight. Sometimes his secretary brings in a projector. Brown's laptop thoughts are beamed onto a screen so that Balls and Miliband can see what he is writing, his Budget speech the centre of attention. No one else is in the room, a smaller, more private study off the original cavernous office Brown first occupied. They bash phrases backwards and forwards - what will tickle the party, what will tickle the nation? - the loyalty of his two trusted lieutenants unquestioned. Not for Brown the process established by his predecessors. It is not officials who draft the Budget speech but the Chancellor himself. Balls is the chief economic adviser to the Treasury. He is the channel through which every minute passes, and he has succeeded in outmanoeuvring the civil servants to ensure that his master's will is done. Brown and Balls hate endless memos. They keep their thoughts in their heads and in Brown's computer. It's safer that way. Not for nothing is Balls nicknamed the deputy chancellor. The other Ed is the brother of David Miliband, head of the Downing Street policy unit. But even the family link is not enough to allow No 10 a peek at Brown's detailed thinking. The Chancellor ensures that the Prime Minister is kept up with the broad themes, but the details are under wraps until the last minute. Other members of the Cabinet are not told about their specific areas of spending until a few days before the big day. The Cabinet as a whole will have to wait until Wednesday morning to hear about the Budget speech. They received a note last month from Downing Street saying Blair had moved the weekly Cabinet meeting forward to next Wednesday morning so that Brown could tell them what was going on. Five hours later Brown will get up in the House of Commons, pile up a set of books so that he can rest his speech high enough for him to see it and tell the nation what he is up to. The Chancellor is not a man for formal meetings. Recent relations between the Chancellor's and Prime Minister's teams have improved, but the tension remains. Brown sees the Treasury as the natural headquarters of economic and social policy. Blair wants to concentrate power in No 10, the Policy Unit and the Cabinet Secretariat. The Treasury - tight-knit, secretive, ferociously intelligent - is winning the battle. Thanks to a series of judiciously timed leaks, it is now becoming clear where Brown's priorities lie. Women, the voters Labour fears are most disillusioned with Tony Blair the politician and New Labour the Government, are to be wooed like never before. Maternity pay will be boosted, rules on how many tax benefits new parents can claim will be relaxed, benefits for families with children will be increased. And the new Labour worry, Mrs Mortgage, will be told that interest rates and mortgage repayments are at their lowest for years. Everything, from a reduction in stamp duty for new homes in deprived areas to boosts for single parents, will be given a family-friendly edge. It has all been planned with meticulous care. In 1998 Brown started plotting the route to the next election, fixed already in his mind as May 2001. Each year the Budget has had slightly more to give away, culminating in the Treasury's 'red-letter day', 5 April 2001. On that day, in a month's time, a series of tax and benefit changes will kick in. Pensions will increase, rules on how much money the elderly can save before they have to pay for their own care will be relaxed, child benefit will increase, road tax will be cut for millions of cars, tax credits aimed at those earning under \u00a340,000 will be launched. Poorer families will be up to \u00a32,600 a year better off. Tax cuts through the increase in the 10p income tax band will mean everyone has a little more in their pocket. An election will be called. Blair will win. Brown will be the man behind it. Perfect. The procession of high-heels clicking across the varnished floorboards upstairs at No 11 Downing Street shortly after the last two Budgets were the first sign. Over the white wine and canap\u00e9s, Brown struggled manfully to make small talk with magazine editors anxious to know where he bought his suits. Sarah Macaulay circled among guests ranging from female MPs and journalists to prominent women such as Germaine Greer and even Cherie Booth. But as with everything Brown does, there was a carefully calculated point to it all - to show that the Chancellor sympathised with women. It underlined a message the Budgets had already made clear with promises of massive increases in childcare places, tax breaks for working women to pay for those childcare places, even the scrapping of VAT on sanitary products last year, a matter so embarrassing to the Chancellor that he failed to mention it in his speech and left it to a junior Minister to brief journalists afterwards. Labour campaign strategists have identified Mrs Mortgage as the woman they have to woo. Middle England, middle income, hard-working, she will be the target of the election campaign. She was picked after research revealed that it was women who were least impressed with the Government's multi-billion pound economic arguments and felt that Labour had failed to be as modernising at it had claimed it would be. The Chancellor has taken this on board, despite his predominantly male core of advisers. Helping him to win Mrs Mortgage's trust are Harriet Harman, an old Brown ally and former Minister, Maeve Sherlock, the former head of the National Council of One Parent Families, and Treasury ministers Dawn Primarolo and Melanie Johnson. Primarolo and Johnson have linked up with the two Women's Ministers, Tessa Jowell and Margaret Jay. It was Primarolo, once a struggling single mother herself, who fought for the children's tax credit to be drawn by mothers as well as fathers, following fears that in some households it would never be spent on the children. But there have been some hiccups for Brown. This week's announcement on maternity pay follows intense haggling between his officials and the women's lobby: the Chancellor favoured targeting help on poor new mothers, arguing that wealthy women earning large salaries did not need the state to top up their bank balances when they gave birth. But he has relented and will announce on Wednesday that the state will provide maternity pay for all, with a likely top-up for those most in need through extra tax credits. Brown is acutely aware that Labour's election hopes will be heavily dependent on his performance in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Party officials know that if the public are not convinced, then the chances of another huge majority could suffer, even though some opinion polls are already predicting such an outcome on 3 May, which is still the favoured date for a poll.

He will also say that diseases once confined to tropical countries could be on the way to Europe as the earth warms up. Michael Meacher, Blair's trusted environment minister, is so concerned that he has told Blair that he believes malaria could soon break out in Britain. Blair agreed to speak at a conference organised by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature after the Government's green credentials were tarnished at last year's earth summit debacle at the Hague. The meeting last November to set new green targets collapsed in chaos when John Prescott, the deputy prime minister with overall responsibility for the environment, stormed out saying that there could be no deal on reducing atmospheric pollution. He then became embroiled in a diplomatic row with the French Green Party minister, Dominique Voynet, who accused Prescott of being too macho. It will be the second time Blair has spoken on green issues in six months, in sharp contrast to the first three years of the Government when he turned down all requests to speak specifically on the issue. Meacher, who has been shown the speech, will raise the problems of the environment in an interview today. Speaking to BBC1's On the Record programme, he will cover much of the ground expected to be developed by Blair on Tuesday. Meacher will make his bleakest assessment of the world situation, saying that malaria could come to major cities in Britain, just as it appeared in New York last summer. 'Rising water levels, the risks to our shore line, particularly in east England. These are the facts, that if the temperature does rise we could see many areas of the country, of the world, including this country, suffering an increase in malaria infestation. It is very, very serious.' Meacher will say that the environment will be one of the 'landmark issues' for Labour's second term, a claim that will raise eyebrows among green lobbyists. 'Whether we like it or not we have fundamentally to change the way in which we run our economy, run our society. 'That's absolutely necessary otherwise we're going to suffer on an intensified scale, the kind of severe flooding which has actually been worse abroad and we may see worse in this country if we don't take note.'",

The scale of the concession is beyond anything mainstream opinion could have imagined when Livingstone was elected mayor nine months ago.</p> <p>It is not just important for the proposed public-private partnership (PPP) for London's Tube - it sets a precedent for constructing public-private partnerships and the private finance initiative across the country, the importance of which is hard to overstate. If this redesigned PPP becomes the template for further partnerships, as it should, Britain would at last have devised a means of genuinely deploying private capital to deliver public objectives. Livingstone and his Transport Commissioner for London, Robert Kiley, have pulled off a coup.</p> <p>That is not how they see it, though, and they are pressing for more. Transport for London does recognise that the Government's proposals are 'not purely cosmetic' and 'undoubtedly represent a real attempt on the Government side to find a compromise', an ungenerous way of describing the biggest climbdown the Government has made in four years of office. Ken Livingstone emphasises the safety dimension - 'Londoners will die if the PPP is forced through' - and Bob Kiley, a passionate believer in command and control management of Underground systems, stresses the need for an unified management structure.</p> <p>The Government may have given him overriding votes, vetoes, assurances of money and de facto board control of the three private infrastructure companies (infracos) charged with modernising and maintaining the Tube for 30 years, but the basic fragmented structure of the PPP remains in place. Unless that is unwound, he cannot begin to negotiate a deal, he explained in a letter to the Government last Friday.</p> <p>But Kiley's response already signals an important change of emphasis. His bottom line, rather than ownership and the right to issue bonds, is safety and unified management control; the Government's is that there is transfer of risk to private infrastructure companies which will undertake the modernisation of the Tube. Meanwhile, there is a threatened strike by the RMT. If a compromise deal is not done soon, London could dissolve into transport chaos.</p> <p>So far, the Government has lost the PR battle hands down, but as the scale of what it has offered becomes more widely known, the line that it is intransigent and inflexible will not hold. The response of the infrastructure companies alone (see our report in today's Business section) will give the lie to that story, with one infraco chief executive fuming that when he saw the Government's proposals he thought they must be a spoof. This is no spoof. It is for real.</p> <p>The first concession is that the Government is prepared to reconstitute the infracos as public-interest, stakeholder companies that must make their strategic and budgetary judgments within a framework set by Bob Kiley and London Underground Limited. Here I acknowledge my interest; this is one of the recommendations the Industrial Society and I made in our report to the mayor and London Assembly as a condition of the PPP going ahead. A quarter of the directors of each infraco board will be non-executive directors charged with protecting the public interest as defined by LUL.</p> <p>Moreover, LUL will be able to sack the chief executive and veto the appointment of a replacement it does not like; it will veto budgets, acquisitions and business plans and its powers will be underwritten by a powerful 'golden' share with special voting rights. As anybody who knows how boards work, this confers real power on Bob Kiley, opening the way for him to appoint his own people, not just as key board members to the infracos but even as chief executive.</p> <p>The second concession is to give LUL the power to direct the day-to-day management of the infracos. 'It would have explicit approval rights over maintenance plans and over the prioritisation and implementation of major programmes of work, power to direct the infracos in the execution of their work, power to approve and sack key managers and unrestricted \"change order\" rights,' says the Treasury. On top, every contract would be 'open book' to ensure there would be no sweetheart deals between the infracos and their shareholders. Small wonder the infracos think the proposal is a spoof. In effect, they would become subcontractors dancing to London Underground's tune.</p> <p>And, lastly, there is money. Again my head spins. For the first time publicly, the Government agrees to provide 'a stable funding regime' that would provide 'explicit grant support' that would not be reviewed 'for each seven-and-half-year contract period'. This is a commitment that no public enterprise has ever won from the Treasury in modern times. Instead of the hand-to-mouth world of annual reviews and sometime cuts within an annual budget, the Treasury is promising to ring-fence what will have to be a substantial grant for each contract period. Gordon Brown's flexibility goes even further. The paper signals that the Government will relieve the infracos of having to pay for any future improvements in the safety regime, or, put another way, if the mayor wants more safety, the Treasury will pay for it.</p> <p>It's been obvious for some time that the Government did not want a row with Livingstone over the Tube in the run-up to an election, and Livingstone's political judgment that he could pull off major concessions has been absolutely right. But apart from scrapping the PPP completely and starting again, a process that, to comply with EU rules on fair tendering, would take another two years, it's hard to see what more substantive the Government can offer. It's offered an open cheque book, de facto unified management control and effective strategic direction to London Underground while trying to transfer some genuine risk to the infracos. The open question is whether the infracos will accept the new deal. My guess is that if they are offered sufficient compensation they will.</p> <p>Livingstone has the Government on the run. He has two options: do a deal around the new proposals or press on to try and crush the PPP. The latter means strikes, massive disruption and, after a general election, probable failure because a newly elected government will be in no mood to compromise.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Prescott and Brown will claim they offered him what he wanted - effective control and cash - but he turned it down to grandstand.

      "body": "<p><strong>Day one: Jugiong to blackheath, Blue Mountains (398 kilometres)</strong></p> <p>Jugiong, in New South Wales, is tiny: the Murrumbidgee river may run through it but the only reason to stop is to slake a big thirst at the imposing Sir George Tavern (established in 1845 and the oldest pub in Australia to remain in the same family). Inside, the thick stone walls are covered with grainy nineteenth-century photographs featuring some of my relatives enjoying a pint, which makes me merely the latest in a long line of familial regulars. My mother even remembers when Jugiong's vast roadside poplars were saplings. </p> <p>Mother lives on a property (the correct term for an Aussie farm - never, ever a ranch) just a couple of dirt-track miles from here, off Australia's busiest road, the Hume Highway. In Australia, however, busy-ness is relative and from her hilltop garden the view is of the rolling Monaro tablelands studded with gums, rocky outcrops and now, in November, the blue flower known as Patterson's Curse, a weed nicknamed for Banjo Patterson (the man best known, by Poms at least, for writing Waltzing Matilda) who imported it to brighten up his garden. To graziers' dismay, Banjo's Curse now runs amok over the Monaro.</p> <p>On a clear day you can see, if not quite forever, then all the way to the Snowy Mountains. But though empty of people it is far from quiet. A flock of pink galahs recently colonised the biggest gum tree in mother's garden, and their noise competes with that of the horses, sheep and dogs, while, after dark, small nocturnal marsupials thud, scuttle and thump on the tin roof. In its own way the bush is noisier than London.</p> <p>Driving away down the dirt track, I watch in the rear-view mirror as my mother leans on her gate, waving tearily. I'm pretty weepy myself but, by the time my partner and I have passed Yass and are heading up the Hume towards the Southern Highlands, I'm also looking forward to a few days on the road. We have a daunting amount of ground to cover before we'll see the sea. </p> <p>Mossvale, Bowral and Mittagong are the main - but small - towns in the bosky Southern Highlands. Within weekending distance of Sydney, I always think of this area as NSW's Surrey or Sussex. Well-heeled, with verdant grazing perfect for stud cattle and dairy farming, there are lots of antique shops and chi-chi country outfitters where exotic imported Barbours hang next to the traditional R.M. Williams moleskins. </p> <p>The Monaro is much wilder and less pretty than this but it is also, to my mind, more Australian. Still, Aussies adore the Southern Highlands because, if you squint, it looks a little like the old country. My mother went to school in Bowral (the boarding schools are back-to-back, just as they are in Surrey), little knowing that my father was then living a few hundred yards away, at 300 Bong Bong Street. Incidentally Sir Donald Bradman, who died just last Sunday after a 92-year innings, first played cricket here, so there is a Bradman museum too. </p> <p>But given that tonight's destination, Blackheath in the Blue Mountains, is still another 180km away, we press on. I want to look for a house called Niudja, in nearby Gladstone Road, Leura - the address on dozens of letters sent to his brother, Charley, by my maternal great-grandfather, Cecil Berkeley Jenkins, from the trenches of northern France. Cecil was later killed in the Spring Offensive of March, 1918. Gladstone Road turns out to be beautiful, high on the ridge of the range and not far from the famous rocks known as the Three Sisters. Unfortunately, among all the grand Edwardian villas built as holiday homes, I fail to locate Niudja, though I like to think it's still there, somewhere, hiding under an assumed name. </p> <p>I'd like to think, too, that it looks like Blackheath's Cleopatra Guest House, where we arrive just in time for cold beers on the verandah. Later, returning to the Three Sisters for a photo-opportunity sunset, I am struck by the unspoilt Jurassic landscape in which tourism lives cheek-by-jowl with ancient tranquillity. At the madly stylish Cleopatra, one can dine on courgette and gruy\u00e8re souffl\u00e9, fine spring lamb and poire William sorbet, just a mile from the spot where botanists identified a new tree as recently as five years ago. It's the most civilised sort of wilderness.</p> <p><strong>Day two: Blackheath to Pokolbin, Hunter Valley (284km)</strong></p> <p>Talk about timing: the local papers are full of the fact that, as of today, the Blue Mountains have been designated Australia's fourtteenth World Heritage Site. What took them so long? You can almost hear the Japanese tourists scrambling to book tickets for what was, yesterday, the plain old Blue Mountains. I'm rather pleased we've beaten them to it. </p> <p>Away from the mountains, on the Great Western Highway, we are soon snarled up by Sydney's sprawl, but skim north on Highway Nine and the emptiness beyond. The most thrilling thing about travelling in Australia, even to someone who has been coming here all her life, is the amount of wild, wanton space. The population of New South Wales (roughly the size of Texas) is just over six million, the same as London. Even in the busy bits there's an awful lot of nothing into which one can disappear. </p> <p>It's early summer but the Aussie weather is as unpredictable as the stuff we've left behind, and newsflashes report the worst floods in living memory - bogglingly, in the north-west of NSW, an area the size of England is underwater. Bathed in sunshine, we arrive at our hotel, the Convent, at Pepper Tree, Pokolbin, and immediately drive off again to the nearby Wandin Valley Estate winery, dismissing laconic warnings from the hotel manager that 'there's a bit of a storm on the way'. Come off it, we're Poms! We can handle rain! </p> <p>But within five minutes something meteorologically biblical occurs. I have never seen rain like this. Or lightning. Or skies so louring. Or, indeed, so green . Green skies, we are told later, usually warn of A Big One, weatherwise. Aquaplaning, unable to see through the windscreen and gibbering with fear, we finally arrive at the Wandin Estate where their ornamental lake has grown into a small inland sea and, short of parting the waves, there is no access. Back in the suitably-named sanctuary of the Convent (and it was a convent once, though several hundred miles from here and moved brick-by-brick) there is no electricity, either. Exhausted, we get an early night. There is an added incentive, however: a dawn balloon trip over the Hunter, weather permitting.</p> <p><strong>Day three: Pokolbin to Armidale (375km)</strong></p> <p>This is my partner's first visit to Australia and though, in Jugiong, he came eyeball-to-eyeball with a 6ft snake (poisonous but, as my uncle had drily observed, 'we're only a 45- minute drive from the hospital, so no worries!'), he has yet to see a 'roo. When he does, it is a whole herds-worth busy dodging our balloon as it skates up and over the gum treetops, so it couldn't really be better. The 'roos stare at us, bounce off, then pause occasionally to box each other. It is magical.</p> <p>Back at Balloon Aloft's HQ, we drink champagne and babble, adrenalised, about last night's storm. Our British pilot, John Clifford, tells us there was three inches of rain in 40 minutes and the pub in nearby Branxton was hit by lightning three times in 20 seconds before the roof blew off. Miraculously (they don't call this the Lucky Country for nothing), nobody was hurt, though there were a lot of spilt pints. This is Oz all right, albeit more like the one with the Wizard. </p> <p>After breakfast we pass the roofless pub, now the talk of New South Wales. I'm not the only the journalist in Branxton, but apparently the news TV crews have already been and gone, so we hit the New England Highway (not very English at all) and head for Armidale, via Tamworth, Australia's country music capital (with a guitar-shaped tourist information centre!). It's a hell of a drive but at least it doesn't rain - and The Eagles' Greatest Hits sounds perfect on the stereo.</p> <p><strong>Day four: Armidale to Byron Bay (388km)</strong></p> <p>After a night in Armidale we are back on the high tablelands formerly known as New Caledonia. There are gorges and waterfalls but not much in the way of misty moors and heather, though Glen Innes's street signs are in English and Gaelic. Just outside the town we spot a sign for the Standing Stones, based on the Ring of Brodgar in the Orkneys and, the locals proudly claim, probably the first to be erected in 3,000 years. To my amusement, each loo roll in the gift shop lavatories is secured by an enormous padlock. They take their Celtic heritage very seriously round these parts. </p> <p>At the junction of the New England and Bruxner Highways, Tenterfield is famous in Australia as the birthplace of the musician Peter Allen (once married to Liza Minnelli) who immortalised it in a song written about his grandfather, 'Tenterfield Saddler', which tends to make Aussies a bit misty-eyed. You can buy Allen's CD (and fine leather goods) in what was the original shop. 'Oh dear!' said my partner as we listened to it in the car. 'You're missing the point,' I said, 'it's an important piece of indigenous culture.' </p> <p>More fun was to be had at the Tenterfield Cobbler's, where the impressively-bearded owner, Steve Smith, gave an impromptu recitation of a highly indigenous-sounding (not to mention scatalogical) self-penned poem about dunnies. Very funny, very Australian and wholly unexpected, Steve - an impressively authentic Aussie 'character' - only slightly spoiled the occasion by admitting he was really a Pommie, born and bred. </p> <p>After 1,500km of wild bush, lushly semi-tropical Byron Bay, the country's most most easterly point, came as pure culture shock. Byron's hip surf kids, mellow holidaymakers and dippy-hippy dropouts are all a long way, in every sense, from my mother's front gate. Here the galahs and scrubby gum trees are replaced by frondy palms and kookaburras which giggle at us from their perch on the gateposts at Taylors, a treasure of a guesthouse.

      "bodyText": "Day one: Jugiong to blackheath, Blue Mountains (398 kilometres) Jugiong, in New South Wales, is tiny: the Murrumbidgee river may run through it but the only reason to stop is to slake a big thirst at the imposing Sir George Tavern (established in 1845 and the oldest pub in Australia to remain in the same family). Inside, the thick stone walls are covered with grainy nineteenth-century photographs featuring some of my relatives enjoying a pint, which makes me merely the latest in a long line of familial regulars. My mother even remembers when Jugiong's vast roadside poplars were saplings. Mother lives on a property (the correct term for an Aussie farm - never, ever a ranch) just a couple of dirt-track miles from here, off Australia's busiest road, the Hume Highway. In Australia, however, busy-ness is relative and from her hilltop garden the view is of the rolling Monaro tablelands studded with gums, rocky outcrops and now, in November, the blue flower known as Patterson's Curse, a weed nicknamed for Banjo Patterson (the man best known, by Poms at least, for writing Waltzing Matilda) who imported it to brighten up his garden. To graziers' dismay, Banjo's Curse now runs amok over the Monaro. On a clear day you can see, if not quite forever, then all the way to the Snowy Mountains. But though empty of people it is far from quiet. A flock of pink galahs recently colonised the biggest gum tree in mother's garden, and their noise competes with that of the horses, sheep and dogs, while, after dark, small nocturnal marsupials thud, scuttle and thump on the tin roof. In its own way the bush is noisier than London. Driving away down the dirt track, I watch in the rear-view mirror as my mother leans on her gate, waving tearily. I'm pretty weepy myself but, by the time my partner and I have passed Yass and are heading up the Hume towards the Southern Highlands, I'm also looking forward to a few days on the road. We have a daunting amount of ground to cover before we'll see the sea. Mossvale, Bowral and Mittagong are the main - but small - towns in the bosky Southern Highlands. Within weekending distance of Sydney, I always think of this area as NSW's Surrey or Sussex. Well-heeled, with verdant grazing perfect for stud cattle and dairy farming, there are lots of antique shops and chi-chi country outfitters where exotic imported Barbours hang next to the traditional R.M. Williams moleskins. The Monaro is much wilder and less pretty than this but it is also, to my mind, more Australian. Still, Aussies adore the Southern Highlands because, if you squint, it looks a little like the old country. My mother went to school in Bowral (the boarding schools are back-to-back, just as they are in Surrey), little knowing that my father was then living a few hundred yards away, at 300 Bong Bong Street. Incidentally Sir Donald Bradman, who died just last Sunday after a 92-year innings, first played cricket here, so there is a Bradman museum too. But given that tonight's destination, Blackheath in the Blue Mountains, is still another 180km away, we press on. I want to look for a house called Niudja, in nearby Gladstone Road, Leura - the address on dozens of letters sent to his brother, Charley, by my maternal great-grandfather, Cecil Berkeley Jenkins, from the trenches of northern France. Cecil was later killed in the Spring Offensive of March, 1918. Gladstone Road turns out to be beautiful, high on the ridge of the range and not far from the famous rocks known as the Three Sisters. Unfortunately, among all the grand Edwardian villas built as holiday homes, I fail to locate Niudja, though I like to think it's still there, somewhere, hiding under an assumed name. I'd like to think, too, that it looks like Blackheath's Cleopatra Guest House, where we arrive just in time for cold beers on the verandah. Later, returning to the Three Sisters for a photo-opportunity sunset, I am struck by the unspoilt Jurassic landscape in which tourism lives cheek-by-jowl with ancient tranquillity. At the madly stylish Cleopatra, one can dine on courgette and gruy\u00e8re souffl\u00e9, fine spring lamb and poire William sorbet, just a mile from the spot where botanists identified a new tree as recently as five years ago. It's the most civilised sort of wilderness. Day two: Blackheath to Pokolbin, Hunter Valley (284km) Talk about timing: the local papers are full of the fact that, as of today, the Blue Mountains have been designated Australia's fourtteenth World Heritage Site. What took them so long? You can almost hear the Japanese tourists scrambling to book tickets for what was, yesterday, the plain old Blue Mountains. I'm rather pleased we've beaten them to it. Away from the mountains, on the Great Western Highway, we are soon snarled up by Sydney's sprawl, but skim north on Highway Nine and the emptiness beyond. The most thrilling thing about travelling in Australia, even to someone who has been coming here all her life, is the amount of wild, wanton space. The population of New South Wales (roughly the size of Texas) is just over six million, the same as London. Even in the busy bits there's an awful lot of nothing into which one can disappear. It's early summer but the Aussie weather is as unpredictable as the stuff we've left behind, and newsflashes report the worst floods in living memory - bogglingly, in the north-west of NSW, an area the size of England is underwater. Bathed in sunshine, we arrive at our hotel, the Convent, at Pepper Tree, Pokolbin, and immediately drive off again to the nearby Wandin Valley Estate winery, dismissing laconic warnings from the hotel manager that 'there's a bit of a storm on the way'. Come off it, we're Poms! We can handle rain! But within five minutes something meteorologically biblical occurs. I have never seen rain like this. Or lightning. Or skies so louring. Or, indeed, so green . Green skies, we are told later, usually warn of A Big One, weatherwise. Aquaplaning, unable to see through the windscreen and gibbering with fear, we finally arrive at the Wandin Estate where their ornamental lake has grown into a small inland sea and, short of parting the waves, there is no access. Back in the suitably-named sanctuary of the Convent (and it was a convent once, though several hundred miles from here and moved brick-by-brick) there is no electricity, either. Exhausted, we get an early night. There is an added incentive, however: a dawn balloon trip over the Hunter, weather permitting. Day three: Pokolbin to Armidale (375km) This is my partner's first visit to Australia and though, in Jugiong, he came eyeball-to-eyeball with a 6ft snake (poisonous but, as my uncle had drily observed, 'we're only a 45- minute drive from the hospital, so no worries!'), he has yet to see a 'roo. When he does, it is a whole herds-worth busy dodging our balloon as it skates up and over the gum treetops, so it couldn't really be better.

It's a hell of a drive but at least it doesn't rain - and The Eagles' Greatest Hits sounds perfect on the stereo.

There are gorges and waterfalls but not much in the way of misty moors and heather, though Glen Innes's street signs are in English and Gaelic.

My reporter in Val d'Is\u00e8re (70/220cm) says the piste and off-piste are 'good and expected to improve' despite it being busy. Chamonix (10/145cm) was cloudy and warm, getting ready for its five-day Cham Jam festival, which starts tomorrow, with competitions up on the Grands Montets.

More snow was hoped for though. Meribel has replaced Val d'Is\u00e8re as the 'most romantic resort' in a poll among resort workers, with Courchevel remaining third. </p> <p>Further south Les Deux Alpes (40/170cm) still had some good skiing higher up, as did Alpe d'Huez (67/220cm) after fresh snow. Isola (120/355cm) was sunny and with excellent pistes, despite not having had new snow for at least 10 days. Off-piste was variable. </p> <p><strong>Italy:</strong> Midweek snowfall improved conditions at Cervinia (100/180cm) though at the cost of higher avalanche risk. Cortina (30/191cm) also benefited and runs to resort were again in good condition. Maddona di Campiglio (70/240cm) was also looking forward to morer excellent skiing once visibility improved. Courmayeur (60/300cm) had fine midweek weather but no new snow. Pistes were still 'excellent' at Sauze d'Oulx but off-piste was 'crusty'. Arabba (80/250cm), despite no new snow for weeks,had 'excellent' pistes. </p> <p><strong>Norway:</strong> Hemsedal (120/190cm) and Geilo (115/130cm) had fine pistes and were still very cold. Voss (50/75cm) was better, thanks to new snow. </p> <p><strong>Sweden:</strong> Are (62/82cm) has improved. </p> <p><strong>USA:</strong> Jackson Hole, Wyoming, (158/168cm) has enjoyed some beautiful 'bluebird' clear-sky days. This week it hosts the twenty-third annual US National Powder Eights, with the winning team going on to the World Championships in Blue River, Canada. In Colorado, Winter Park (173/188cm) had fresh snow at the start of the week, but since then has been cloudy and dry. There was good powder skiing, with 18 lifts and 120 trails open. </p> <p>Copper Mountain had 124cm midweek, Crested Butte 121cm, Keystone 114cm and Vail 121cm. All trails were open and enjoying packed powder. In Utah, where too much new snow did for the pre-Olympic downhills at Snowbasin (262cm average base), conditions have settled. All trails are open at Alta (241cm), Deer Valley (234cm), Park City (196cm) and Snowbird (241cm).

In Colorado, Winter Park (173/188cm) had fresh snow at the start of the week, but since then has been cloudy and dry. There was good powder skiing, with 18 lifts and 120 trails open. Copper Mountain had 124cm midweek, Crested Butte 121cm, Keystone 114cm and Vail 121cm. All trails were open and enjoying packed powder. In Utah, where too much new snow did for the pre-Olympic downhills at Snowbasin (262cm average base), conditions have settled. All trails are open at Alta (241cm), Deer Valley (234cm), Park City (196cm) and Snowbird (241cm). In California, Mammoth (245/265cm) and Heavenly (95/175cm), are both excellent. On the slopes: The tabloids' new 'queen of the It girls', Lady Victoria Hervey, is said to be going to ski in Courchevel this season instead of her usual choice, Verbier. Gerard Depardieu was seen on the lifts at Val D'Is\u00e8re. Best skiing: Courchevel, departing Saturday 10 March from Gatwick or Manchester, half-board at Chalet Athos, including free ski guiding. The price: \u00a3529 per person sharing, with flights and transfers. From Le Ski (0870 754 4444). \u0095 The AITO directory of ski operators, whose representatives help to compile this report, is available free by calling 020 8607 9080.",

      "body": "<p>As we drove into Auckland from the airport at half-past five in the morning, I felt really quite overcome. Everything was simultaneously familiar, and different. The suburbs reminded me of Los Angeles - pretty wooden houses, bright-flowered gardens. The centre resembled Sydney - not as dramatic, but still sky-scrapered, water-bound and sparkling. We went for a walk as soon as we'd checked in, and ended up on K Road (full name: Karangahape Road - everyone calls it K Road). I thought of the boho parts of Notting Hill. </p> <p>It was still very early. None of K Road's multifarious second-hand shops were open (the best are in St Kelvin's Arcade). But a couple of caf\u00e9s had their doors ajar, some still serving from the night before. We breakfasted, American-style (they like their pancakes and eggs benedict in New Zealand), in a place called Brazil, next to a group of security guards and a couple of quite ludicrous middle-aged drag queens. K Road is littered with lady-boys d'un certain age , gamely sporting full slap and heels at all times of day. It's the kind of area that even the Rough Guide calls 'vibrant': meaning there's sex shops and gay clubs, trendy caffs and clubbers' boutiques, and, as in all 'vibrant' districts, a distinctly non-Caucasian community. </p> <p>In New Zealand, in the North Island in particular, the Maoris make up a significant and formidable part of Kiwi culture. They came in 1200 AD, from Polynesia, making New Zealand the last major land mass on Earth to be settled by humans. Maoris are proud of their heritage - hence the intimidating Haka dance the All Blacks perform at every rugby match - and their riotous, live-life-to-the-full attitude is a contrast to the European descendants' slight inferiority complex. All New Zealanders are really friendly - quite astonishingly so, to a Brit - but among the white people, there's also a palpable sense of liberal self-doubt. They have none of the Australians' boorish confidence; New Zealand is quiet, sensitive Canada to Australia's brash United States. </p> <p>Of course, to a quiet, sensitive Observer reader, this is all quite delightful. A country where they speak English and don't insist on bombasting you with their fantasticness! Where they get your sense of humour! And where - this is the best bit - you are a millionaire! The pound is very strong against the Kiwi dollar at the moment, so you can swan about to your heart's content. </p> <p>Plus, no one tips, apparently. We didn't realise this for a couple of weeks, and couldn't understand why waiters and bar staff kept following us down the street, offering us their children and the like. We were national celebrities within days. Actually, that's not much of an exaggeration. Wear a funny hat and you make the front page round these parts. We had a running joke about, 'Cat still up tree' headlines; about a week into our holiday, we were watching the news when there was a five-minute item about just that. </p> <p>Back to specifics. We spent a couple of weeks in Auckland, on and off, before setting off for a tour of both the North and South Islands. Despite Auckland's size, all the bits you want to see are pretty much within walking - or ferrying - distance. There's the Sky Tower, pointing hypodermic needle-like to the heavens from the centre of town. Locals think it's naff, but lunch in the rotating restaurant on a sunny day is a proper treat. As is a boat trip to Devonport, a chi-chi suburb across the water, or - even better - to Waiheke, a lush, hippy-esque island with lovely beaches. </p> <p>Auckland's main shopping drag is Queen Street. For more unusual boutiques, try High Street, which runs parallel. Stella Greg stocks local designers; Touchstone does wonderful jewellery. There are plenty of great bars: Deschlers, in High Street, which boasts live jazz, fine cocktails and leather booths, is a good one, and there are a couple of lively, Seventies-look drinkeries at the junction of Queen Street and K Road. </p> <p>For evening entertainment that doesn't involve quite so much alcohol (in New Zealand, a double is the preferred measure), try the Classic Comedy Club in Queen's Street. Complete with candles and table service, it's a refreshing reminder that stand-up doesn't have to be an on-stage battle between performer and packs of baying drunks. Oh, and it's got an excellent bar, too. </p> <p>It can be hard to leave the laid-back yet lively delights of Auckland but once you make the effort, you're not disappointed. New Zealand boasts the most stunning scenery I've seen this side of Iceland. Most of the more dramatic delights are to be found in the South Island, but the North has its fair share of geographical eye-candy. North of Auckland you'll find the chic and pretty Bay of Islands area (Russell, small but perfectly formed, is the place to stay here), where you can boat-trip and cocktail-sip until you're blue and green in the face. </p> <p>If you venture further north, you'll be rewarded by twisting, empty roads and dense, primeval foliage. Things get swampy. And at the very top is Ninety Mile Beach, a silver strip of sand that stretches off as far as you can see. You can drive on it, if you've got a four-wheel-drive. You're not meant to do this in a hire car, but they'll never know - unless you sink it (and this is more usual than you might like to hear). </p> <p>Wellington, the capital, is in the South--west of the North Island. Smaller and more determindedly 'alternative' than Auckland (one resident told me, with some pride, that there were more body piercings per capita in Wellington than anywhere else in the country), it's also more self-conscious and, therefore, not so friendly. </p> <p>There are lovely restaurants, mostly around Courtney Place. Cuba Street has the best bars - we liked Matterhorn - and Wellington was the only place where we actually had a dance, at Bodega, a smoky, down-home joint with funny funk DJs. Plus, Wellington boasts the unmissable Te Papa (Our Place), the Museum of New Zealand, with state-of-the-art architecture and international shows. </p> <p>We didn't make it to Napier and the South- east, though you should, if you're looking for a sun-bunny break. We did go to the Coromandels, a wild peninsula not far from Auckland. Camping on Hot Water Beach, we got up at 5.30am to catch low tide. (Yes, this was an effort.) You dig a hole in the sand, and it fills up with water from beneath. It really is boiling: you have to scrape a channel to the sea to activate the 'cold tap'. And you have to dig a lot to make a bath. We settled for an early morning bidet. </p> <p>But the highlight of a trip to the North Island is Rotorua, the 'Sulphur City', where even the shabbiest motel offers a spa bath. The ground bubbles with volcanic activity; just five days before we visited, a geyser erupted 20ft into the air near the town centre. We went to see the damage. The ground all around was petrified by volcanic ash. The trees had turned to soot and lace. And this was in the equivalent of your local park. </p> <p>Rotorua is a town of contrasts: there are ridiculously formal gardens round the corner from a seething sulphur lake; and there is a living Maori village, where the villagers cook, wash and bathe in hot springs. Maori children swim in the river at the entrance to the village, diving for the pennies that holidaymakers chuck into the warm, welcoming water. 'Come back lady, come back mister,' they shout to the more generous. And you know, I think we just might. </p> <p> <strong>March 4: Australia and New Zealand special</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/story/0,7451,446038,00.html\"> My mother and father of a journey</a> Kathryn Flett samples the wild, open roads of her parents' nation, driving 1,400 kilometres through bush, peaks and plains where floods cover land the size of England.</p> <p><a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/story/0,7451,446051,00.html\"> Miles of style</a> It's smart, chic - and home to Neighbours.

      "byline": "Gaby Wood",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that nothing is more likely to strike fear and xenophobia into the heart of an English person than a national treasure being appropriated by an American. This can usually be avoided by ensuring that what we choose to call a national treasure is a figure so self-deprecating that Americans couldn't possibly want her. Sometimes, however, the plan goes astray. Enter Bridget Jones, the international bestseller. </p> <p>It is a truth universally avoided that nowhere is our curious mix of national pride and national shame more in evidence than in our film industry. We want to take Hollywood by storm, but we don't want Hollywood to take our jobs. We want to win all the Oscars, but every new British film is met with a domestic chorus of disapproval. Could all these fraught elements of the British psyche ever come together in a single project? Enter Bridget Jones, the movie, due out next month. </p> <p>The filmmakers were never in the position of simply making an adaptation of a mere book. From the very beginning, they were adapting a phenomenon. Screenwriter Richard Curtis says this actually made it easier: 'At least in Bridget Jones you kind of know what the big subject matter is. So it was convenient being able to say, \"Well, have we fulfilled the brief of what made it a phenomenon?\"' </p> <p>It also means, however, that fans were oversensitive from the start. Ever since 1998, when Working Title, the production company responsible for Four Weddings and Notting Hill, began their search for the Bridget of the silver screen, the media have been set to pounce. And when, after a full two years, they lighted not on Kate Winslet or Helena Bonham Carter or even the Australian Cate Blanchett or the flatteringly glamorous Cameron Diaz, but on... Renee Zellweger, the British newspapers had a field day. </p> <p>Zellweger is a Texan blonde, not a glamourpuss but a soft-centred, round-faced actress, best known at that time for her role as Tom Cruise's love interest in Jerry Maguire and, more recently, for her deadpan performances in the high-profile Hollywood comedies Me, Myself and Irene and Nurse Betty, for which she won a Golden Globe. Zellweger was a high school cheerleader who is said to have worked in a topless bar without taking her top off, and whose first acting job was an ad for Texan beef. </p> <p>She is, it would seem, as wholesome and un-Bridget-like as they come. In the words of a former school friend, 'You couldn't find anyone more American than Renee'. </p> <p>As it happens, Zellweger's mother is Norwegian and her father is Swiss. Nevertheless, as if criticism of the casting wasn't bad enough, rumours began to circulate early on about the quality of the film itself. </p> <p>The script was co-written by Helen Fielding (of original novel fame), Richard Curtis (of Four Weddings and Notting Hill fame) and Andrew Davies (of BBC costume drama fame, and Pride and Prejudice in particular). The film is directed by Sharon Maguire, of no fame at all. It is Maguire's debut feature; her ostensible qualification for the job is that - apart from directing TV documentaries - she, like Curtis, is a friend of Fielding's, and is acknowledged at the front of the novel. In fact, Shazza, a character in the novel itself, is a fictionalised version of Maguire. So, to all intents and purposes, she found herself turning her life and her friends into a movie, and casting Smack The Pony 's Sally Phillips as, broadly, herself. </p> <p>Inevitably the rumour mill began to turn: Zellweger was so bad Hugh Grant, her co-star, was threatening to drop out. Sets were being struck too early and had to be rebuilt. Scenes were re-written, re-cut, re-shot. Everything was way behind schedule. </p> <p>Whether or not any of this was true makes hardly any difference. Because it's just a symptom of what is always hoped: it is a matter of honour in England to prepare for the bitterest shame. If 'The Making of Bridget Jones's Diary' is ever filmed, it ought to be called Pride and Prejudice . The fact is that most films are subject to such complications. The rumours may have persisted, paradoxically, because the film is such a closely guarded secret. The PR firm in question has a stranglehold on it, and is letting few people see even an early or a shortened version. Sharon Maguire can be reached but not interviewed: she has been placed under a gagging order. The soundtrack, which features songs re-recorded by Geri Halliwell and Robbie Williams, is still being worked on. </p> <p>But a few intrepid adventurers, including The Observer, have succeeded in sneaking a preview. A leaked memo shows that the film has tested well in... Reading. And now we can exclusively reveal that Bridget Jones's Diary is not a total embarrassment! </p> <p>Zellweger has mastered the nasal sing-song of a self-defeating Sloane. Some may not have imagined Bridget to be quite this posh, and those who found Gwyneth Paltrow's accent in Emma, Sliding Doors or Shakespeare in Love jarring may think this one (trained by the same dialogue coach) unbearable. But, particularly in the voice-over, it does enhance the story's Jane Austen overtones, and Zellweger has impeccable comic timing. Her appalling speech as publicist to the inauspiciously titled book 'Kafka's Motorbike', and her stumbling reprise in front of Mark Darcy's family, will elicit a heartfelt cringe from the most stony-faced observers. Hugh Grant, her boss and 'fuckwit' lover Daniel Cleaver, plays a version of himself in which the familiar charm turns out to be entirely phoney. And in a twist of self-referential genius, Colin Firth plays Darcy, as an updated version of what we have come to see as himself - a Jane Austen hero, scripted once again by Andrew Davies. </p> <p>The film has been spoken of as part of a trilogy, with Four Weddings and Notting Hill as its predecessors. All three have been scripted at least in part by Richard Curtis, they share the same producers, they all star Hugh Grant, and all of them feature an American as their female lead. It is certainly a tribute to Sharon Maguire that the set of three appears so seamless - you would never know that this film was made by a first-time director. But, despite their obvious similarities, Bridget Jones is if anything an inversion of the others: the American actress, more of a focal point this time than Hugh Grant, has adopted an English accent; rather than being an exotic import, she is meant to be an unremitting home-grown loser; and Grant turns out to be a bastard - an effect which works precisely because we are used to thinking of him as the harmless hero. </p> <p>Nick James, editor of Sight and Sound, was impressed: 'It was much more interesting than I thought it was going to be, because no other country in the world would make a film about a woman who hates herself for being womanly in this way. I think the Helen Fielding/Richard Curtis crowd have changed self-deprecation into self-hatred. It used to be that the English gent abroad would always be self-deprecating, but there is a qualitative difference between that and self-hatred.' </p> <p>A turning point comes in the film when Bridget confronts Mark Darcy with the words: 'You seem to go out of your way to make me feel like a complete idiot every time I see you. And you really needn't bother. Because I already feel like an idiot most of the time anyway.' At another point she is jilted, with perfect irony, by Daniel Cleaver, when he explains his attraction to another woman: 'Lara... being American... well, it's something to do with confidence.' </p> <p>In fact, one of the central problems the filmmakers must have faced was how to portray self-loathing on screen. We are familiar with the Bridget Jones drill in print, but how do you deal with having to make her concrete? Is she really fat, for example, or does she just think of herself as fat? If she is not fat (as seems clear from the body weights given with each diary entry), then how can the way she feels about her body, an intangible self-doubt, be put across? </p> <p>Richard Curtis thinks that portraying a state of mind is 'the most interesting thing about adapting a book. It surprised us how much we had to portray her loneliness, and stuff like that. The book is her talking herself out of it, whereas in the film we found we had to show it at times, and that was quite interesting - it did change it, even though I hope that all the good stuff from the book is still there.

      "bodyText": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that nothing is more likely to strike fear and xenophobia into the heart of an English person than a national treasure being appropriated by an American. This can usually be avoided by ensuring that what we choose to call a national treasure is a figure so self-deprecating that Americans couldn't possibly want her. Sometimes, however, the plan goes astray. Enter Bridget Jones, the international bestseller. It is a truth universally avoided that nowhere is our curious mix of national pride and national shame more in evidence than in our film industry. We want to take Hollywood by storm, but we don't want Hollywood to take our jobs. We want to win all the Oscars, but every new British film is met with a domestic chorus of disapproval. Could all these fraught elements of the British psyche ever come together in a single project? Enter Bridget Jones, the movie, due out next month. The filmmakers were never in the position of simply making an adaptation of a mere book. From the very beginning, they were adapting a phenomenon. Screenwriter Richard Curtis says this actually made it easier: 'At least in Bridget Jones you kind of know what the big subject matter is. So it was convenient being able to say, \"Well, have we fulfilled the brief of what made it a phenomenon?\"' It also means, however, that fans were oversensitive from the start. Ever since 1998, when Working Title, the production company responsible for Four Weddings and Notting Hill, began their search for the Bridget of the silver screen, the media have been set to pounce. And when, after a full two years, they lighted not on Kate Winslet or Helena Bonham Carter or even the Australian Cate Blanchett or the flatteringly glamorous Cameron Diaz, but on... Renee Zellweger, the British newspapers had a field day. Zellweger is a Texan blonde, not a glamourpuss but a soft-centred, round-faced actress, best known at that time for her role as Tom Cruise's love interest in Jerry Maguire and, more recently, for her deadpan performances in the high-profile Hollywood comedies Me, Myself and Irene and Nurse Betty, for which she won a Golden Globe. Zellweger was a high school cheerleader who is said to have worked in a topless bar without taking her top off, and whose first acting job was an ad for Texan beef. She is, it would seem, as wholesome and un-Bridget-like as they come. In the words of a former school friend, 'You couldn't find anyone more American than Renee'. As it happens, Zellweger's mother is Norwegian and her father is Swiss. Nevertheless, as if criticism of the casting wasn't bad enough, rumours began to circulate early on about the quality of the film itself. The script was co-written by Helen Fielding (of original novel fame), Richard Curtis (of Four Weddings and Notting Hill fame) and Andrew Davies (of BBC costume drama fame, and Pride and Prejudice in particular). The film is directed by Sharon Maguire, of no fame at all. It is Maguire's debut feature; her ostensible qualification for the job is that - apart from directing TV documentaries - she, like Curtis, is a friend of Fielding's, and is acknowledged at the front of the novel. In fact, Shazza, a character in the novel itself, is a fictionalised version of Maguire. So, to all intents and purposes, she found herself turning her life and her friends into a movie, and casting Smack The Pony 's Sally Phillips as, broadly, herself. Inevitably the rumour mill began to turn: Zellweger was so bad Hugh Grant, her co-star, was threatening to drop out. Sets were being struck too early and had to be rebuilt. Scenes were re-written, re-cut, re-shot. Everything was way behind schedule. Whether or not any of this was true makes hardly any difference. Because it's just a symptom of what is always hoped: it is a matter of honour in England to prepare for the bitterest shame. If 'The Making of Bridget Jones's Diary' is ever filmed, it ought to be called Pride and Prejudice . The fact is that most films are subject to such complications. The rumours may have persisted, paradoxically, because the film is such a closely guarded secret. The PR firm in question has a stranglehold on it, and is letting few people see even an early or a shortened version. Sharon Maguire can be reached but not interviewed: she has been placed under a gagging order. The soundtrack, which features songs re-recorded by Geri Halliwell and Robbie Williams, is still being worked on. But a few intrepid adventurers, including The Observer, have succeeded in sneaking a preview. A leaked memo shows that the film has tested well in... Reading. And now we can exclusively reveal that Bridget Jones's Diary is not a total embarrassment! Zellweger has mastered the nasal sing-song of a self-defeating Sloane. Some may not have imagined Bridget to be quite this posh, and those who found Gwyneth Paltrow's accent in Emma, Sliding Doors or Shakespeare in Love jarring may think this one (trained by the same dialogue coach) unbearable. But, particularly in the voice-over, it does enhance the story's Jane Austen overtones, and Zellweger has impeccable comic timing. Her appalling speech as publicist to the inauspiciously titled book 'Kafka's Motorbike', and her stumbling reprise in front of Mark Darcy's family, will elicit a heartfelt cringe from the most stony-faced observers. Hugh Grant, her boss and 'fuckwit' lover Daniel Cleaver, plays a version of himself in which the familiar charm turns out to be entirely phoney. And in a twist of self-referential genius, Colin Firth plays Darcy, as an updated version of what we have come to see as himself - a Jane Austen hero, scripted once again by Andrew Davies. The film has been spoken of as part of a trilogy, with Four Weddings and Notting Hill as its predecessors. All three have been scripted at least in part by Richard Curtis, they share the same producers, they all star Hugh Grant, and all of them feature an American as their female lead. It is certainly a tribute to Sharon Maguire that the set of three appears so seamless - you would never know that this film was made by a first-time director. But, despite their obvious similarities, Bridget Jones is if anything an inversion of the others: the American actress, more of a focal point this time than Hugh Grant, has adopted an English accent; rather than being an exotic import, she is meant to be an unremitting home-grown loser; and Grant turns out to be a bastard - an effect which works precisely because we are used to thinking of him as the harmless hero. Nick James, editor of Sight and Sound, was impressed: 'It was much more interesting than I thought it was going to be, because no other country in the world would make a film about a woman who hates herself for being womanly in this way. I think the Helen Fielding/Richard Curtis crowd have changed self-deprecation into self-hatred. It used to be that the English gent abroad would always be self-deprecating, but there is a qualitative difference between that and self-hatred.' A turning point comes in the film when Bridget confronts Mark Darcy with the words: 'You seem to go out of your way to make me feel like a complete idiot every time I see you. And you really needn't bother. Because I already feel like an idiot most of the time anyway.' At another point she is jilted, with perfect irony, by Daniel Cleaver, when he explains his attraction to another woman: 'Lara... being American... well, it's something to do with confidence.' In fact, one of the central problems the filmmakers must have faced was how to portray self-loathing on screen. We are familiar with the Bridget Jones drill in print, but how do you deal with having to make her concrete? Is she really fat, for example, or does she just think of herself as fat? If she is not fat (as seems clear from the body weights given with each diary entry), then how can the way she feels about her body, an intangible self-doubt, be put across? Richard Curtis thinks that portraying a state of mind is 'the most interesting thing about adapting a book. It surprised us how much we had to portray her loneliness, and stuff like that. The book is her talking herself out of it, whereas in the film we found we had to show it at times, and that was quite interesting - it did change it, even though I hope that all the good stuff from the book is still there. I think that probably is the secret of adapting: how to stand outside a character who you've got to know from the inside.' Renee Zellweger chose to put on weight for the part. This in itself wouldn't necessarily reflect a state of mind, but a mishap unrelated to the film turned out to prove that she had somehow morphed into her character. While in England to rehearse her British accent before shooting started, she was subjected to a diet of omelettes, bacon, milkshakes, burgers, pizzas, Guinness, and lots of desserts. Eventually she put on a stone. Some months later, Harper's Bazaar wanted to feature Zellweger as their cover girl. They took some pictures, but when the editor saw the results she was horrified.

By the middle of this week the two huge statues will be gone - victims of dogma, desperation and 20 years of war.</p> <p>Senior officials of the Taliban militia government yesterday ignored international outrage to proudly announce that their troops were progressing well with the demolition work. 'The head and legs of the Buddha statues in Bamiyan have been destroyed,' said Qudratullah Jamal, the Taliban Information and Culture Minister.</p> <p>'Our soldiers are working hard to demolish their remaining parts. They will come down soon. We are using everything at our disposal to destroy them. There is no question of stopping.'</p> <p>Spades, picks, anti-tank rockets, anti-aircraft guns and explosives are being used, Jamal said. Elsewhere in Afghanistan thousands of other artifacts were being smashed. Jamal said that, in accordance with a decree issued by Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban's reclusive, one-eyed, spiritual leader, all 'idols' were to be destroyed because they were 'un-Islamic'. Jamal said: 'Two-thirds of all the statues [here] have already been destroyed, the remainder will be destroyed in the next two days.'</p> <p>The two statues in Bamiyan, 175 and 120 feet tall, are hewn from the side of a mountain. The largest, carved in the third century AD, is thought to be the world's tallest standing Buddha.</p> <p>Both were damaged by artillery fire during previous fighting and have suffered at the hands of looters who have stripped them of their colourful decorations.</p> <p>Yesterday the Taliban were facing fierce criticism from across the world. Leaders of many Buddhist countries, as well as Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, expressed their dismay at the destruction. India, a staunch opponent of the Taliban, accused them of 'medieval barbarism'.</p> <p>Even Muslim Pakistan, which has supported the Taliban militarily and diplomatically from the movement's beginning, called for moderation. A number of Islamic countries criticised the ideological basis for Mullah Omar's edict and appealed to them to respect 'universal human heritage'. But the Taliban's resolve appears, if anything, to have hardened.</p> <p>A senior Taliban official in Islamabad told The Observer that apart from the three countries - Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - that have recognised the religious militia as the legitimate government of Afghanistan - the rest of the world 'had no right to complain'. 'They give us nothing... Why should we listen to them?' he said.</p> <p>The issue of the future of the statues has come up before. When the Taliban captured Bamiyan three years ago, an over-enthusiastic local commander fired a rocket at the biggest statue. He was disciplined on the orders of Mullah Omar who said other religions should be respected in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Since then, factions of moderates and hardliners have battled within the movement. The conservatives believe that if the country can be made to follow Islamic law to the letter then God will reward them all by bringing peace and prosperity.</p> <p>The Taliban's refusal to deport Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist who is based in eastern Afghanistan, resulted in the imposition of sanctions in December 1999. The moderates believe aid and trade are essential and are willing to compromise to end the country's isolation. The destruction of the idols is thus a significant victory for the conservatives.</p> <p>Importantly ministers in Kabul called the campaign a religious imperative. It is also a powerful symbol of the power of the Taliban, who are largely Sunni Muslims and drawn from the Pashtoon tribes. A recent rebellion in Bamiyan, whose people are Shia Muslims from the Hazara tribe, was viciously put down, reportedly with brutal massacres. The demolition of the Buddhas has unequivocally demonstrated the militia's authority.</p> <p>Though many in Afghanistan oppose the destruction of the idols, few will voice any support for the West. Most Afghans feel great bitterness at the West's failure to send significant aid to their country despite a series of humanitarian crises.</p> <p>According to many analysts it is the poverty of the country and the lawlessness that follows that has led to the rise, and considerable support for the Taliban. The UN sanctions, though aimed at the regime, have also hit the people hard.</p> <p>Refugees in western Iran said last week that the Afghan currency had lost a third of its value. As Afghanistan imports the bulk of its staple foods, people simply could not buy enough food to feed their families. The worst drought in 30 years and an upsurge in fighting has created huge armies of refugees. The UN says hundreds have died in recent weeks from cold and hunger in the camps where many of the displaced now live.</p> <p>On Afghanistan's border with Iran last week The Observer saw harsh evidence of the state of the country.</p> <p>By the side of a dusty mountain road lay the bodies of 11 Afghan smugglers shot in a gun battle with Iranian anti-narcotics forces. The soldiers who killed them were jubilant but when a colonel tipped out a sack of the smugglers' possessions - a few stained, embroidered blankets, a grubby fistful of virtually worthless notes - even the hardened fighters of the border patrols felt some sympathy for the men who had been forced by poverty to risk, and lose, their lives for a pittance. Three of the dead were less than 15 years old.</p> <p>'They keep coming and we keep killing them. They have no choice,' one soldier told The Observer as they loaded the smugglers on to a truck. 'At least they'll keep their eyes,' said another, the bodies having been collected before the birds could get to work.</p> <p>If they had stayed in Afghanistan they would have their eyes and maybe their lives but little else.</p> <p><b>Related Story</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,446121,00.html\">Comment: 'Heritage terrorism' is a way of sticking two fingers up at West</a></p>",

Jamal said: 'Two-thirds of all the statues [here] have already been destroyed, the remainder will be destroyed in the next two days.' The two statues in Bamiyan, 175 and 120 feet tall, are hewn from the side of a mountain. The largest, carved in the third century AD, is thought to be the world's tallest standing Buddha. Both were damaged by artillery fire during previous fighting and have suffered at the hands of looters who have stripped them of their colourful decorations. Yesterday the Taliban were facing fierce criticism from across the world. Leaders of many Buddhist countries, as well as Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, expressed their dismay at the destruction. India, a staunch opponent of the Taliban, accused them of 'medieval barbarism'. Even Muslim Pakistan, which has supported the Taliban militarily and diplomatically from the movement's beginning, called for moderation. A number of Islamic countries criticised the ideological basis for Mullah Omar's edict and appealed to them to respect 'universal human heritage'. But the Taliban's resolve appears, if anything, to have hardened. A senior Taliban official in Islamabad told The Observer that apart from the three countries - Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - that have recognised the religious militia as the legitimate government of Afghanistan - the rest of the world 'had no right to complain'. 'They give us nothing... Why should we listen to them?' he said. The issue of the future of the statues has come up before. When the Taliban captured Bamiyan three years ago, an over-enthusiastic local commander fired a rocket at the biggest statue. He was disciplined on the orders of Mullah Omar who said other religions should be respected in Afghanistan. Since then, factions of moderates and hardliners have battled within the movement. The conservatives believe that if the country can be made to follow Islamic law to the letter then God will reward them all by bringing peace and prosperity. The Taliban's refusal to deport Osama bin Laden, the suspected terrorist who is based in eastern Afghanistan, resulted in the imposition of sanctions in December 1999. The moderates believe aid and trade are essential and are willing to compromise to end the country's isolation. The destruction of the idols is thus a significant victory for the conservatives. Importantly ministers in Kabul called the campaign a religious imperative. It is also a powerful symbol of the power of the Taliban, who are largely Sunni Muslims and drawn from the Pashtoon tribes. A recent rebellion in Bamiyan, whose people are Shia Muslims from the Hazara tribe, was viciously put down, reportedly with brutal massacres. The demolition of the Buddhas has unequivocally demonstrated the militia's authority. Though many in Afghanistan oppose the destruction of the idols, few will voice any support for the West. Most Afghans feel great bitterness at the West's failure to send significant aid to their country despite a series of humanitarian crises. According to many analysts it is the poverty of the country and the lawlessness that follows that has led to the rise, and considerable support for the Taliban. The UN sanctions, though aimed at the regime, have also hit the people hard. Refugees in western Iran said last week that the Afghan currency had lost a third of its value. As Afghanistan imports the bulk of its staple foods, people simply could not buy enough food to feed their families. The worst drought in 30 years and an upsurge in fighting has created huge armies of refugees. The UN says hundreds have died in recent weeks from cold and hunger in the camps where many of the displaced now live. On Afghanistan's border with Iran last week The Observer saw harsh evidence of the state of the country. By the side of a dusty mountain road lay the bodies of 11 Afghan smugglers shot in a gun battle with Iranian anti-narcotics forces. The soldiers who killed them were jubilant but when a colonel tipped out a sack of the smugglers' possessions - a few stained, embroidered blankets, a grubby fistful of virtually worthless notes - even the hardened fighters of the border patrols felt some sympathy for the men who had been forced by poverty to risk, and lose, their lives for a pittance. Three of the dead were less than 15 years old. 'They keep coming and we keep killing them. They have no choice,' one soldier told The Observer as they loaded the smugglers on to a truck. 'At least they'll keep their eyes,' said another, the bodies having been collected before the birds could get to work. If they had stayed in Afghanistan they would have their eyes and maybe their lives but little else. Related Story Comment: 'Heritage terrorism' is a way of sticking two fingers up at West",

      "byline": "Philip French",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Fifty years ago, Harold Wilson, then President of the Board of Trade, presented an award to Margaret Lockwood, calling her 'the finest actress in the world'. He explained his claim: 'For there's no doubt that the British film industry today is first and foremost among the film industries of the world.' </p> <p>Sensitive people winced at his chauvinism, but there was a British industry then. Powell and Pressburger were at their zenith, Carol Reed and David Lean were directing classics, Ealing was producing films that would make the studio a byword for comedy. Our filmmakers didn't need to go to Hollywood to make their names or to have proper careers. </p> <p>What have we now? A cottage industry that turns out dozens of little pictures on local themes, most funded by lottery money. Few cover their costs and all but a handful would have been better aborted at script stage. All the expensive pictures made here are Hollywood productions, using the abundance of local craft talent. </p> <p>So what was last Sunday night's ghastly event, the Orange Bafta Awards at the Odeon Leicester Square, all about? The British Academy of Film and Television Arts is a little known organisation of movie people established in 1946 with modest premises in Piccadilly. It's made little contribution towards advancing the cinematic arts. </p> <p>Believing that it was the timing of the occasion, not its mediocrity, that has invited so little publicity, Bafta's leaders decided this year to steal a march on Hollywood by staging the awards three weeks before the Oscars and so showing the way to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Scientists. Dream on; get real; pur-leaze - choose your clich\u00e9. </p> <p>The occasion proved as bad as could have been expected, a side-street disaster with star witnesses. Stephen Fry, its master of ceremonies, was not at his best, more Julian Clary than Oscar Wilde as he dispensed feeble, self-deprecatory camp jokes. He'd donned a strange hairy suit that looked like the gorilla outfit Marlene Dietrich wore in Blonde Venus without the headpiece. As the evening wore on, one began to long for some Oscar-night kitsch to enliven the sorry proceedings. Every open award went to an American picture (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is officially a China-Taiwan-US co-production) with two exceptions - Jamie Bell, best actor of the year, and Julie Walters, best supporting actress, both for Billy Elliot. Predictably the prize for outstanding British film also went to Billy Elliot. </p> <p>Equally predictably, the perceived triumph of Billy Elliot produced the headlines - 'Billy Elliot boy fights off Gladiator' (Daily Telegraph), 'Durham lad outshines Hollywood stars' (the Times ) </p> <p>The editor of Screen International got so excited about 'the limos stacked up in a holding pattern around Leicester Square waiting to spill their precious cargo onto the red carpet' that he momentarily lost the ability to distinguish an Australian Crowe from the American species: 'If the sight of Cameron Crowe, Tom Hanks and Geoffrey Rush sitting in the auditorium waiting to see if they had won the best actor award was not good enough, to have the award then passed to a plucky British lad was heaven sent.' So now God is on the side of the British cinema and pulling strings at Bafta. </p> <p>How to describe the effect of having Russell Crowe and Rush come from Australia and Tom Hanks fly in from America to be patronised in Leicester Square? I thought of what it might have been like had the Canadian government staged a prize-giving in 1923 on the northerly shores of Hudson's Bay, inviting Chaplin, Keaton, Fairbanks and Valentino to make their way there by sledge and kayak. And then given the best actor award to the illiterate Eskimo who played the title role in Flaherty's Nanook of the North. Despite his striking performance, is Jamie Bell qualified to receive anything other than the special awards that used to be given to talented youngsters? </p> <p>So what should Bafta do? Trying to influence Hollywood isn't going to work, so, like similar organisations in Europe, they should concentrate on the native filmmakers.

      "bodyText": "Fifty years ago, Harold Wilson, then President of the Board of Trade, presented an award to Margaret Lockwood, calling her 'the finest actress in the world'. He explained his claim: 'For there's no doubt that the British film industry today is first and foremost among the film industries of the world.' Sensitive people winced at his chauvinism, but there was a British industry then. Powell and Pressburger were at their zenith, Carol Reed and David Lean were directing classics, Ealing was producing films that would make the studio a byword for comedy. Our filmmakers didn't need to go to Hollywood to make their names or to have proper careers. What have we now? A cottage industry that turns out dozens of little pictures on local themes, most funded by lottery money. Few cover their costs and all but a handful would have been better aborted at script stage. All the expensive pictures made here are Hollywood productions, using the abundance of local craft talent. So what was last Sunday night's ghastly event, the Orange Bafta Awards at the Odeon Leicester Square, all about? The British Academy of Film and Television Arts is a little known organisation of movie people established in 1946 with modest premises in Piccadilly. It's made little contribution towards advancing the cinematic arts. Believing that it was the timing of the occasion, not its mediocrity, that has invited so little publicity, Bafta's leaders decided this year to steal a march on Hollywood by staging the awards three weeks before the Oscars and so showing the way to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Scientists. Dream on; get real; pur-leaze - choose your clich\u00e9. The occasion proved as bad as could have been expected, a side-street disaster with star witnesses. Stephen Fry, its master of ceremonies, was not at his best, more Julian Clary than Oscar Wilde as he dispensed feeble, self-deprecatory camp jokes. He'd donned a strange hairy suit that looked like the gorilla outfit Marlene Dietrich wore in Blonde Venus without the headpiece. As the evening wore on, one began to long for some Oscar-night kitsch to enliven the sorry proceedings. Every open award went to an American picture (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is officially a China-Taiwan-US co-production) with two exceptions - Jamie Bell, best actor of the year, and Julie Walters, best supporting actress, both for Billy Elliot. Predictably the prize for outstanding British film also went to Billy Elliot. Equally predictably, the perceived triumph of Billy Elliot produced the headlines - 'Billy Elliot boy fights off Gladiator' (Daily Telegraph), 'Durham lad outshines Hollywood stars' (the Times ) The editor of Screen International got so excited about 'the limos stacked up in a holding pattern around Leicester Square waiting to spill their precious cargo onto the red carpet' that he momentarily lost the ability to distinguish an Australian Crowe from the American species: 'If the sight of Cameron Crowe, Tom Hanks and Geoffrey Rush sitting in the auditorium waiting to see if they had won the best actor award was not good enough, to have the award then passed to a plucky British lad was heaven sent.' So now God is on the side of the British cinema and pulling strings at Bafta. How to describe the effect of having Russell Crowe and Rush come from Australia and Tom Hanks fly in from America to be patronised in Leicester Square? I thought of what it might have been like had the Canadian government staged a prize-giving in 1923 on the northerly shores of Hudson's Bay, inviting Chaplin, Keaton, Fairbanks and Valentino to make their way there by sledge and kayak. And then given the best actor award to the illiterate Eskimo who played the title role in Flaherty's Nanook of the North. Despite his striking performance, is Jamie Bell qualified to receive anything other than the special awards that used to be given to talented youngsters? So what should Bafta do? Trying to influence Hollywood isn't going to work, so, like similar organisations in Europe, they should concentrate on the native filmmakers. Honour them, criticise them, hold them up to higher standards - and don't be so damn conservative. Why didn't any prize go to the British writer-director Christopher Nolan's shoestring Following, the most promising film of 1999, or to his low-budget American thriller, Memento, one of the original pictures of 2000? Albert Finney, who became a star in an authentically British film, was there to receive an Academy fellowship. But otherwise, most of the numinous British names mentioned that night - Balcon, Korda, Asquith, Lean - were attached to awards.",

      "body": "<p>Tom Fox has been farming pigs for 40 years, but only a year ago did he see the future. Pig prices were low, and being driven down further by the supermarkets; his farm in Warwickshire was becoming uneconomic, and he thought he would have to give up. But rather than be a victim of the industrialisation of agriculture, he decided to do something radical: breed high-quality pigs that customers wanted, and sell direct to them.</p> <p>He has a herd of 50 breeding sows that are a cross-breed between wild boar and Gloucester spot. His pigs are housed without crates, without stalls, and with plenty of straw. 'They take one or two months longer to grow, but it shows in the taste. We make them into a rather nice sausage, and dry cured bacon,' he said. A few times a week, he or one of his helpers takes their produce and sells it direct to the public through a farmers' market, cutting out the supermarkets and meat traders.</p> <p>'The public like buying the meat from us and seeing the farmer - they know it's fresh and hasn't come from South Africa or Canada,' he said.</p> <p>Farmers like Fox are now being held up as shining examples in an industry that, after 50 years of industrialisation and mass production, has in the past week come under unprecedented assault from every direction.</p> <p>The outbreak of foot and mouth disease across the country - like BSE, salmonella, swine fever and E. coli - is now widely seen as a symptom of the industrialisation of agriculture. The mass transit of animals - both across Britain from farms to centralised abattoirs and across national borders - has spread the disease further and faster than before. But the industrialisation of agriculture is also responsible for the extreme slaughter policy for a disease that is rarely fatal to animals and harmless to humans. Even farmer groups admit the policy is simply the result of the drive for higher productivity and lower costs.</p> <p>With Britain largely closed down by the crisis, the demand for more natural methods of food production - usually confined to the margins - have reached such a crescendo that the Prime Minister has been forced to add his voice. In an unprecedented move, Tony Blair promised to 'work out the basis on which we want sustainable agriculture for the long term'. Tony Juniper, policy director of Friends of the Earth, gloated: 'Thank goodness the penny has finally dropped, and Tony Blair himself has joined the debate.'</p> <p>The policy of confinement and mass slaughter has now closed Britain down more effectively than floods, hurricanes and fuel protests. First it was the transport of animals that was banned. But within a week the nation's forests, national parks, National Trust houses, RSPB reserves and several royal parks have all closed to the public. Horse racing, hunting, the Crufts dog show, and the Countryside Alliance march have all been banned or postponed.</p> <p>Walking on a footpath has become a criminal offence, with fines of up to \u00a35,000. The national census - the 10-yearly population count due at the end of April - may be postponed for reasons other than war for the first time ever. Even the general election may have to be put back.</p> <p>The Government has also warned that it has considered killing off much of Britain's wildlife - such as deer and wild boar, hedgehogs and foxes - as well as many of the animals kept in zoos.</p> <p>But none of this need be. It is just that the alternatives - letting the disease run its course or vaccinating animals - either cost more for farmers or damages their productivity. Foot and mouth kills only frail animals, with almost all recovering in a few weeks. There is no risk to human health from meat carrying the virus. But the animals would lose their appetite and lose weight, and so would be worth less.</p> <p>Ian Campbell of the National Pig Association said: 'You would hit their growth capabilities. You have a relatively short production cycle in pigs - they are born and eaten within five and a half months. If they have foot and mouth disease, then they would need another month or two months. You would severely damage the economics of it.'</p> <p>One former Cabinet Minister argued that the disease could be tolerated in Britain, as it is in some other countries: 'It's a disease that doesn't affect humans, and it kills only a small proportion of animals, and hurts fertility and lowers production. We could have it endemic, and all it would do is affect profits slightly.'</p> <p>The alternative - until recently favoured in Europe - is to vaccinate the animals, which the Government yesterday said it was now considering. Recent advances in vaccines mean they are now very effective and could wipe out the symptoms of the disease, if not the disease itself. 'You either vaccinate or stamp it out,' said Chris Bostok, director of the Institute for Animal Health. 'But vaccines are very short-lived - you need to revaccinate them every six months or so.'</p> <p>This would prove expensive, particularly for farmers who would have to pay for the vaccination themselves, but get the taxpayer to compensate them if they slaughter the animals. 'It's very expensive to vaccinate. If Britain has unthrifty animals, we won't compete well,' said David Tyson, president of the British Veterinary Association.</p> <p>'Vaccination is complex, balancing political issues rather than scientific ones - you're balancing costs with benefits,' said Bostok. A government cost benefit analysis in 1986 showed that the cost of vaccination exceeded the worst case scenario cost of eradication.</p> <p>But the biggest problem with vaccination is that Britain has persuaded the rest of Europe to abandon it. Until the early Nineties, European countries such as France and Germany used routinely to vaccinate. But the completion of the single market required a level playing field, and any country that harbours foot and mouth - whether it vaccinates or not - cannot export meat. Stephen Rossides, head of food, health and science at the National Farmers Union, said: 'If you don't slaughter, you won't be able to export. Once you vaccinate, you lose your disease-free status, which has severe economic impact.'</p> <p>Abigail Woods, who is researching foot and mouth disease at Manchester University, said: 'The need to get rid of the disease is the result of the intensification of agriculture, which is based on improving productivity. If we hadn't spent the last 50 years moving to global foot and mouth eradication, it would be easier to go back.'</p> <p>In a dramatic concession to the hard-line eradication policy, Nick Brown yesterday admitted that, if the outbreak got much worse, Britain might have to go down the vaccination route. The cost of killing Britain's livestock and wildlife would be too high.</p> <p>The statement was a sign of just how deeply the Government was rethinking its commitment to the cheap food policy that has prevailed since the Second World War, largely through the subsidies dished out by the Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>Juniper said: 'Farmers have suffered disaster after disaster in the last 20 years, and incomes are at rock bottom. People have lost confidence in the way their food is produced. Much of our wildlife is gone, and rural landscapes impoverished. We cannot continue like this.'</p> <p>Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association, which upholds standards in organic farming in the UK, is optimistic that at last there will be radical reform. 'The conditions exist for the right kind of reform. We need to see agriculture in terms of its impact on rural employment, the environment, and public health,' he said.</p> <p>At present, only 3 per cent of Britain's farmland is organic. Environmental groups are calling on the Chancellor to introduce a 'pesticides tax', which he first mooted several years ago, but has failed to introduce.</p> <p>Organic livestock farmers practise 'clean grazing' so they don't have to drench their animals in chemicals to kill off parasites. Instead they use the techniques of a hundred years ago, grazing sheep and cows on alternate years on a particular patch of grass to break the parasites' lifecycle. 'Pests and parasites are a sign that husbandry is poor. Instead of trying to suppress these things, you should change your practices,' said Holden.</p> <p>The organic movement also wants to promote local production and local consumption. 'We should have a county-by-county, food-first policy so that it would be a matter of pride that every part of Britain supports the farmers and products of that place,' said Holden. This would lead to shorter distribution times, and would also change the nature of the British landscape.</p> <p>But this largely depends on how much the public wants it. Almost two thirds of organic food is bought by just 7 per cent of shoppers. A return to more natural methods will almost certainly mean higher prices in shops, but savings for taxpayers in terms of subsidising and compensating farmers. For the poor - who pay little tax but benefit from cheaper food - this may not seem an attractive option.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,446099,00.html\">Comment: A cow is just a cow</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,446098,00.html\">Comment: Foot and mouth; not many voters lost</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446139,00.html\">Comment: Sacrifices on the altar of cheap food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4141953,00.html\">Comment: Paying the price for cheaper food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446142,00.html\">Around the country - foot and mouth latest</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446162,00.html\">Disease suspected on Continent</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446141,00.html\">Fear grows in plague village</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446158,00.html\">Ireland put under plague siege</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446160,00.html\"> Law to break supermarkets' grip on farmers </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446137,00.html\">Who's to blame?</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,  443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,  441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html  \">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">Wh at do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd\" target=\"_new\">MAFF information and factsheets</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/eur-  lex/en/lif/dat/1985/en_385L0511.html\" target=\"_new\">EU legislation on the disease</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/info/f&amp;ml.asp\" target=\"_new\">Latest news from the NFU</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot and mouth disease</a></p>",

But we never thought in our wildest dreams that he\u0092d end up as Foreign Secretary.</p> <p>None of the worthless promises and miserable failure of Labour\u0092s first term compares to what they have in store if we were to let them win again.</p> <p>Just imagine four more years of Labour. Try to picture what our country would look like.

We\u0092re ready because of the changes you have made to our Party. We\u0092re ready because of the victories that you have won in local and European elections.</p> <p>But above all we\u0092re ready to speak for the people of Britain: for the mainstream majority who have no voice, for the hard-working people who feel they are ignored, for the men and women who despair that their country is being taken from them. We are not going to let them down.</p> <p>We\u0092re ready and we can win.</p> <p>As the next election draws near, people are beginning only now to focus on what the two parties stand for.</p> <p>Well if there\u0092s one thing above all that sets me apart from Tony Blair, it\u0092s this: I\u0092m not embarrassed to articulate the instincts of the British people.</p> <p>The governing of this country has drifted far away from the decent, plain speaking common sense of its people. Its time to bring it back. It\u0092s time to bring Britain home.</p> <p>We have a Government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs.</p> <p>There is nothing that the British people can talk about, that this Labour Government doesn\u0092t deride.</p> <p>Talk about Europe and they call you extreme. Talk about tax and they call you greedy. Talk about crime and they call you reactionary. Talk about asylum and they call you racist. Talk about your nation and they call you Little Englanders.</p> <p>This Government thinks Britain would be alright if only we had a different people.</p> <p>I think Britain would be alright, if only we had a different Government.</p> <p>A Conservative Government that speaks with the voice of the British people.</p> <p>A Conservative Government never embarrassed or ashamed of the British people.</p> <p>A Conservative Government that trusts the people.</p> <p>I trust the people.</p> <p>I trust the people on tax. People know that you can\u0092t spend more than you have. And they know that that holds true for governments as well for them. It seems like common sense to you and me. But not to Gordon Brown.</p> <p>He\u0092s already running up huge bills on your behalf. He\u0092s promising to blow billions of pounds of your money. And what\u0092s spent today will have to be paid for tomorrow.</p> <p>With Michael Portillo as Chancellor, Britain will spend no more than it can afford; and Britain will tax no more than it needs.</p> <p>We will scale back the waste and bureaucracy that has grown up like a fungus under this Government. We\u0092ll cut the size of Whitehall and cut the number of politicians.</p> <p>I\u0092m going to reduce the size of the Cabinet, cut the number of ministers, reduce the size of the House of Commons, campaign for a European Parliament with 100 fewer members, halve the number of political advisers, and abolish a huge swathe of Labour\u0092s regional bureaucracies and agencies \u0096 and their offices in Brussels.</p> <p>It is the mission of the next Conservative Government to build the Responsible Society. That\u0092s why I want to support the people who are trying to do the right thing.</p> <p>To the hard-working people who set a little bit aside each month, to provide for their children, or to fund their own retirement, I say: you should be rewarded not punished. You should be allowed to keep every penny of the interest on your savings. You\u0092ve already paid tax on your money once; you shouldn\u0092t have to do it twice. We\u0092re going to make your savings tax free.</p> <p>And to the pensioners who have paid their contributions throughout their lives, and who now want the dignity of independence, I say: you have already done your bit. You shouldn\u0092t have to go on paying. We\u0092re going to take a million pensioners out of the tax system altogether.</p> <p>And to the younger people who don\u0092t want to rely on the state in their retirement, I say: you should have the opportunity to build up your own pension fund. You should be able to use the National Insurance system to fund your own retirement. We\u0092re going to give you the choice we never had to be independent of the Government.</p> <p>And to married couples, struggling and sacrificing to do their best for their children, I say: you are doing the right thing. You are providing the stable homes that children need. Your contribution should be recognised. That\u0092s why we\u0092re going to introduce a new Married Couple\u0092s Allowance \u0096 a transferable allowance worth as much as \u00a31000. It\u0092s time we had a Government that supported the idea of marriage instead of doing everything it can to undermine it.</p> <p>Spending only what the country can afford, rewarding savings, encouraging independence, supporting marriage: people know that these things are common sense. And I trust the people.</p> <p>And I also trust our doctors and nurses and teachers and policemen. I say let them get on with their jobs without politicians peering over their shoulders.</p> <p>To the teacher weig hed down with paperwork, I say: you\u0092ve been messed around too often. You came into teaching to spend your time teaching children not filling in forms.</p> <p>Listen to Chris Woodhead, the former Chief Inspector of Schools: \u0091David Blunkett has \u0085 wasted taxpayers\u0092 money, distracted teachers from their real responsibilities and encapsulated the worst of the discredited ideology that has done so much damage since the 1960s. He has just not delivered. A generation of children has been betrayed\u0092.</p> <p>The end of term report on a Labour Government. A generation of children has been betrayed.</p> <p>Labour have been listening for too long to the so-called experts who think that competition is a dirty word and that communicating facts to our children is elitist. Well, they\u0092ve had their chance and, in all too many schools, we can see the result: poor discipline, declining standards and low expectations.</p> <p>Let\u0092s not be afraid to speak the common sense truth: you can\u0092t have high standards without good discipline.</p> <p>Let\u0092s trust the common sense instinct that says that children need a structured day, that heads know most about their own school, and that teachers should be free to get on with teaching.</p> <p>When Theresa May is Education Secretary we\u0092re going to set our schools free with their own admissions policies. Parents will get higher standards and a real choice about where to send their children. And teachers who run disciplined classrooms will get our support not end up in court.</p> <p>And what\u0092s true for our schools is true for our hospitals. To the patient queuing up even to be allowed on to a waiting list, I say: you\u0092ve waited long enough. Doctors, not politicians, should decide when you are treated.</p> <p>When Liam Fox is Health Secretary, there\u0092ll be guaranteed waiting times and those with the most serious conditions will be treated first. Nurses will be nurses, not pen pushers. And instead of Labour\u0092s dogmatic hostility to any form of private medicine, we\u0092re going to expand the total health care available in the country by supporting instead of attacking those who take out personal medical insurance.</p> <p>People know that it\u0092s just common sense. And I trust the people.</p> <p>And I trust the people on crime. Labour may dismiss the views of the mainstream majority as prejudiced and ignorant. They may scoff at our calls for punishment that fits the crime.</p> <p>But we know, and the British people know, that we will never defeat crime until we put more police on the street and given them the support they need to do their job.</p> <p>It seems common sense to you and me. But Labour, once again, prefers to listen to the self-appointed experts: to the liberal sociologists, who have so much to say about the rights of the criminal, and so little about the rights of the victim.</p> <p>I met a lady a few weeks ago on a housing estate in Newark who said to me: \u0091I can\u0092t remember when I last saw a policeman on my street. And I\u0092m frightened to go out after 5 o\u0092clock\u0092.</p> <p>I say to her: every street should be safe. And to the people who feel that their own town centres are closed to them on a Friday night, I say: we will crack down on violence and yobbery.</p> <p>We will stop releasing prisoners early. We will reverse Labour\u0092s cuts in police numbers. We will support our police where Labour has undermined them.</p> <p>And we will take on the compensation culture that pays out thousands of pounds to IRA terrorists who shoot their way out of jail. Such payments insult the victims of terrorism and disgrace our country: I believe it is an outrage.</p> <p>The people of Britain want a Home Secretary who will give them back their streets. They want a Home Secretary who will speak up for the victim, not the criminal. Ann Widdecombe will be that Home Secretary.</p> <p>And it\u0092s common sense that when we\u0092re dealing with an international trade in asylum seekers, we should make Britain a safe haven not a soft touch.</p> <p>So to the law-abiding citizen, who wants to help those genuinely fleeing persecution, but who also wants fairness in the system, I say: we will sort out the asylum crisis. The next Conservative Government will assess the validity of asylum claims within weeks, not years. And, where applications are unfounded, immediate deportation will follow.</p> <p>This country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice \u0096 Conservative Governments always have, and always will. But it\u0092s precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside by claimants who have been rehearsed in how to play the system.</p> <p>Once again, Labour despises the opinions of the people it is supposed to represent.</p> <p>But we trust the people. They are not bigoted or ungenerous. They understand that Britain has responsibilities to those who have been displaced by war or persecution. But they can also read maps. And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when tens of thousands of people are crossing the entire length of the European Continent, travelling through safe countries en route, before suddenly lodging an asylum claim in Britain.</p> <p>And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when desperate people hide in the undercarriage of high speed trains to get through the Channel Tunnel.</p> <p>We will clear up Labour\u0092s asylum mess. We will welcome genuine refugees, but we will be a safe haven not a soft touch.</p> <p>That is not bigotry. It\u0092s plain common sense. People know it. And I trust the people.</p> <p>Above all, the people of Britain believe in their country. They are not narrow nationalists. They are not xenophobes. But they take pride in what our country has achieved.</p> <p>No country has contributed as we have to the freedom of mankind. Through the centuries, we have aligned ourselves with the cause of nationhood everywhere. In the Nineteenth Century, we sponsored the independence of Italy and Greece and Hungary, and we nurtured the freedom of the South American Republics. In the Twentieth Century, we twice fought for the cause of all nations against tyranny.</p> <p>We introduced the world to free trade. We carried law and freedom to new continents. These were our achievements as a sovereign and united country. And they are achievements that we should be proud to teach in our schools.</p> <p>But now we have a government that scorns and despises all the things that have made our country what it is. A government that holds Britishness cheap.</p> <p>You can see it in their failure to defend the Union of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>It is because we believe in the Union that we have accepted the wishes of the peoples of Scotland and Wales to have a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly. But there is a logical consequence, also vital to the survival of the Union.</p> <p>In the opening days of our administration, we will change the rules so that when matters that only affect England come before the House of Commons only MPs from England will vote.</p> <p>And we have a Labour Government that scorns and despises the very Parliament to which they were elected.</p> <p>Prime Minister\u0092s Questions reduced to once a week. The Speaker driven to complain because announcements are being leaked to the press, not made at the Dispatch Box. The Prime Minister and his MPs rarely even in the Chamber. Parliament\u0092s powers parceled out in every direction \u0096 outwards to Brussels, downwards to the devolved assemblies, sideways to our judges through the Human Rights Act. Now, Tony Blair intends to give up the first and greatest of Parliament\u0092s prerogatives, namely the right to control revenue.</p> <p>Within two years of winning an election, Tony Blair would force this country into the euro.</p> <p>It\u0092s true that he\u0092s had to promise us a referendum. But who will set the terms of that referendum? Tony Blair. Who will decide when to hold it? Tony Blair. Who will draft the question? Tony Blair.</p> <p>If anyone believes that we\u0092ll be allowed a free and fair vote, just take a look at the way in which Labour have already rigged the rules.</p> <p>They\u0092ve given themselves the right to use the Government\u0092s resources to push for a \u0093Yes\u0094 vote. They\u0092ve fixed artificial spending limits, to give the \u0093Yes\u0094 campaign a huge financial advantage. They\u0092ve even written in a special exemption so that the \u0093Yes\u0094 campaign can receive money from elsewhere in the EU.</p> <p>They\u0092ll spend every pound they can lay their hands on, until there\u0092s no Pound left at all. And I say to everyone who believes in our country: make no mistake about it, this election is your last chance to keep the Pound.</p> <p>And it\u0092s your last chance to vote for a Britain that still controls its own destiny. Labour and their Liberal lapdogs have said that if they win the election, they will ratify the Nice Treaty, and establish a European constitution and the start of an EU legal system. And they\u0092ll agree t</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0093As we gather here this weekend, we think of our fellow members and friends who had planned to be with us today in Harrogate, but who have had to remain at home or on their farms. The thoughts and sympathy of the whole Conference are with all those whose livelihoods are at risk from the spread of the foot and mouth disease. The pall of black smoke from the funeral pyres of slaughtered animals across our nation today tells the desperate story of a countryside in crisis. I know from my own constituency that, for farmers already struggling in the depths of the worst agricultural depression for sixty years, this latest blow could not be more cruel or more bitter. We support all the Government is doing to eradicate the disease and we welcome the financial support they have announced. People have responded with calmness and restraint to this crisis. In postponing a protest in which they had invested months of preparation, the hundreds of thousands of people who were due to take part in the Countryside March for Liberty and Livelihood have shown great responsibility and courage. I believe it would show the nation\u0092s solidarity with the countryside in this terrible hour if the Government were to suspend consideration of the Hunting Bill in Parliament at least until those who wish to protest against it are free to do so again. This morning we have also heard of a different kind of courage \u0096 the courage of one young man in a Burmese jail. James Mawdsley. We heard about his unwavering belief in freedom. We heard of his passionate commitment to democracy and hatred of oppression. We heard of his defiance in the face of the extraordinary efforts made to silence him. And we heard of his pride that he is part of this Conservative family. By his actions James Mawdsley reminded us of all that is best about our Party. We remember the enduring values that have run through two centuries of Tory history. The Tory values that stretch back to the days when Wilberforce freed the slaves, and Pitt led a war against tyranny, and Burke wrote his great tracts and Shaftsbury stood and watched the pauper\u0092s funeral and dedicated his life to the poor. The values that animated the Conservative leaders of the Twentieth Century: the leadership of Winston Churchill, the resolve of Margaret Thatcher and the decency of John Major. All of us are proud to be part of this Conservative family. And the values that have shaped our past must also guide our future. The determination to fight for freedom and democracy. The resolve to protect our national independence. The courage to speak the truth in an age of spin and political correctness. The self confidence to fight for our beliefs even when the odds are against us and to fight so hard against those odds that we win. The boldness to fight the next election on the most ambitious Conservative programme for a generation. For we are going to go further than any government has ever gone before to hand back to individuals and families the ability to shape their own lives. At his Party\u0092s Spring Conference, Tony Blair said that we were to blame for cynicism about politics. What a typically cynical attack from a man whose entire career has been built on one piece of cynicism after another. When a Cabinet Minister who is sacked for telling lies is re-appointed, in the face of every constitutional convention, only for the same man to be sacked again from the same Cabinet for the same offence by the same Prime Minister \u0096 no wonder the public are cynical about politics. When the Lord Chancellor violates the trust of his great office of state to solicit party donations from people whose careers he can control, and then says \u0091I\u0092m not sorry, and I\u0092d do it again\u0092 \u0096 no wonder the public think that power has gone to thei r heads. When we have a Deputy Prime Minister who tells people not to drive cars but has two Jags himself, and where the Minister who tells people not to have two homes turns out to have nine himself \u0096 no wonder the public believe politicians are hypocrites. And when the man who holds the highest office in politics will say anything and do anything to stay in power, when he thinks nothing of deceiving the public and Parliament, when he stuffs offices of the Crown with his cronies from Islington, breaking every promise on which he was elected, spinning yet another gimmick and yet another re-announcement in order to disguise his failure to deliver on anything at all - no wonder the public say they don\u0092t trust their Government. This morning we read in the papers that, at the last election, the Labour Party hired American students to infiltrate our campaign. Well, we have a confession to make. They weren\u0092t the only ones playing that game. We hired a bearded buffoon to infiltrate their campaign. But we never thought in our wildest dreams that he\u0092d end up as Foreign Secretary. None of the worthless promises and miserable failure of Labour\u0092s first term compares to what they have in store if we were to let them win again. Just imagine four more years of Labour. Try to picture what our country would look like. Let me take you on a journey to a foreign land \u0096 to Britain after a second term of Tony Blair. The Royal Mint melting down pound coins as the euro notes start to circulate. Our currency gone forever. The Chancellor returning from Brussels carrying instructions to raise taxes still further. Control over our own economy given away. The jail doors opening as thousands more serious criminals walk out early to offend again. Police morale at a new low. The price gauge on the petrol pump spinning ever faster as fuel taxes rise still further. Letters arriving on doorsteps cancelling yet another round of hospital operations under a Government that is all spin and no delivery. That\u0092s Labour\u0092s Britain four years from now. And if there are meant to be so many people enthusiastic for another four years of Labour, how come you never meet any of them? Labour\u0092s Britain four years from now. Could anybody stomach it? The Dome still for sale. Peter Mandelson re-appointed to the Cabinet for a fourth time. The Liberals, on the edge of their seats, still convinced that a referendum on proportional representation is just around the corner. We\u0092re not going to sit idly by and let this happen to our country. That\u0092s why Michael Ancram has prepared us to fight the best organised, most vigorous, most spirited campaign we\u0092ve ever fought in order to save Britain from this nightmare. We are going to say to all the people who have been hit by Labour\u0092s stealth taxes: Can you afford another four years? To all the people who are still waiting for their operation: Can you really wait another four years? To all the people who are still waiting to see a policeman on their street: Can you really wait another four years? To all the parents who are waiting for better education: Can you really wait another four years? So we\u0092re ready for the fight. We\u0092re ready because of the changes you have made to our Party. We\u0092re ready because of the victories that you have won in local and European elections. But above all we\u0092re ready to speak for the people of Britain: for the mainstream majority who have no voice, for the hard-working people who feel they are ignored, for the men and women who despair that their country is being taken from them. We are not going to let them down. We\u0092re ready and we can win. As the next election draws near, people are beginning only now to focus on what the two parties stand for. Well if there\u0092s one thing above all that sets me apart from Tony Blair, it\u0092s this: I\u0092m not embarrassed to articulate the instincts of the British people. The governing of this country has drifted far away from the decent, plain speaking common sense of its people. Its time to bring it back. It\u0092s time to bring Britain home. We have a Government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs. There is nothing that the British people can talk about, that this Labour Government doesn\u0092t deride. Talk about Europe and they call you extreme. Talk about tax and they call you greedy. Talk about crime and they call you reactionary. Talk about asylum and they call you racist. Talk about your nation and they call you Little Englanders. This Government thinks Britain would be alright if only we had a different people. I think Britain would be alright, if only we had a different Government. A Conservative Government that speaks with the voice of the British people. A Conservative Government never embarrassed or ashamed of the British people. A Conservative Government that trusts the people. I trust the people. I trust the people on tax. People know that you can\u0092t spend more than you have. And they know that that holds true for governments as well for them. It seems like common sense to you and me. But not to Gordon Brown. He\u0092s already running up huge bills on your behalf. He\u0092s promising to blow billions of pounds of your money. And what\u0092s spent today will have to be paid for tomorrow. With Michael Portillo as Chancellor, Britain will spend no more than it can afford; and Britain will tax no more than it needs. We will scale back the waste and bureaucracy that has grown up like a fungus under this Government. We\u0092ll cut the size of Whitehall and cut the number of politicians. I\u0092m going to reduce the size of the Cabinet, cut the number of ministers, reduce the size of the House of Commons, campaign for a European Parliament with 100 fewer members, halve the number of political advisers, and abolish a huge swathe of Labour\u0092s regional bureaucracies and agencies \u0096 and their offices in Brussels. It is the mission of the next Conservative Government to build the Responsible Society. That\u0092s why I want to support the people who are trying to do the right thing. To the hard-working people who set a little bit aside each month, to provide for their children, or to fund their own retirement, I say: you should be rewarded not punished. You should be allowed to keep every penny of the interest on your savings. You\u0092ve already paid tax on your money once; you shouldn\u0092t have to do it twice. We\u0092re going to make your savings tax free. And to the pensioners who have paid their contributions throughout their lives, and who now want the dignity of independence, I say: you have already done your bit. You shouldn\u0092t have to go on paying. We\u0092re going to take a million pensioners out of the tax system altogether. And to the younger people who don\u0092t want to rely on the state in their retirement, I say: you should have the opportunity to build up your own pension fund. You should be able to use the National Insurance system to fund your own retirement. We\u0092re going to give you the choice we never had to be independent of the Government. And to married couples, struggling and sacrificing to do their best for their children, I say: you are doing the right thing. You are providing the stable homes that children need. Your contribution should be recognised. That\u0092s why we\u0092re going to introduce a new Married Couple\u0092s Allowance \u0096 a transferable allowance worth as much as \u00a31000. It\u0092s time we had a Government that supported the idea of marriage instead of doing everything it can to undermine it. Spending only what the country can afford, rewarding savings, encouraging independence, supporting marriage: people know that these things are common sense. And I trust the people. And I also trust our doctors and nurses and teachers and policemen. I say let them get on with their jobs without politicians peering over their shoulders. To the teacher weig hed down with paperwork, I say: you\u0092ve been messed around too often. You came into teaching to spend your time teaching children not filling in forms. Listen to Chris Woodhead, the former Chief Inspector of Schools: \u0091David Blunkett has \u0085 wasted taxpayers\u0092 money, distracted teachers from their real responsibilities and encapsulated the worst of the discredited ideology that has done so much damage since the 1960s. He has just not delivered. A generation of children has been betrayed\u0092. The end of term report on a Labour Government. A generation of children has been betrayed. Labour have been listening for too long to the so-called experts who think that competition is a dirty word and that communicating facts to our children is elitist. Well, they\u0092ve had their chance and, in all too many schools, we can see the result: poor discipline, declining standards and low expectations. Let\u0092s not be afraid to speak the common sense truth: you can\u0092t have high standards without good discipline. Let\u0092s trust the common sense instinct that says that children need a structured day, that heads know most about their own school, and that teachers should be free to get on with teaching. When Theresa May is Education Secretary we\u0092re going to set our schools free with their own admissions policies. Parents will get higher standards and a real choice about where to send their children. And teachers who run disciplined classrooms will get our support not end up in court. And what\u0092s true for our schools is true for our hospitals. To the patient queuing up even to be allowed on to a waiting list, I say: you\u0092ve waited long enough. Doctors, not politicians, should decide when you are treated. When Liam Fox is Health Secretary, there\u0092ll be guaranteed waiting times and those with the most serious conditions will be treated first. Nurses will be nurses, not pen pushers. And instead of Labour\u0092s dogmatic hostility to any form of private medicine, we\u0092re going to expand the total health care available in the country by supporting instead of attacking those who take out personal medical insurance. People know that it\u0092s just common sense. And I trust the people. And I trust the people on crime. Labour may dismiss the views of the mainstream majority as prejudiced and ignorant. They may scoff at our calls for punishment that fits the crime. But we know, and the British people know, that we will never defeat crime until we put more police on the street and given them the support they need to do their job. It seems common sense to you and me. But Labour, once again, prefers to listen to the self-appointed experts: to the liberal sociologists, who have so much to say about the rights of the criminal, and so little about the rights of the victim. I met a lady a few weeks ago on a housing estate in Newark who said to me: \u0091I can\u0092t remember when I last saw a policeman on my street. And I\u0092m frightened to go out after 5 o\u0092clock\u0092. I say to her: every street should be safe. And to the people who feel that their own town centres are closed to them on a Friday night, I say: we will crack down on violence and yobbery. We will stop releasing prisoners early. We will reverse Labour\u0092s cuts in police numbers. We will support our police where Labour has undermined them. And we will take on the compensation culture that pays out thousands of pounds to IRA terrorists who shoot their way out of jail. Such payments insult the victims of terrorism and disgrace our country: I believe it is an outrage. The people of Britain want a Home Secretary who will give them back their streets. They want a Home Secretary who will speak up for the victim, not the criminal. Ann Widdecombe will be that Home Secretary. And it\u0092s common sense that when we\u0092re dealing with an international trade in asylum seekers, we should make Britain a safe haven not a soft touch. So to the law-abiding citizen, who wants to help those genuinely fleeing persecution, but who also wants fairness in the system, I say: we will sort out the asylum crisis. The next Conservative Government will assess the validity of asylum claims within weeks, not years. And, where applications are unfounded, immediate deportation will follow. This country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice \u0096 Conservative Governments always have, and always will. But it\u0092s precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside by claimants who have been rehearsed in how to play the system. Once again, Labour despises the opinions of the people it is supposed to represent. But we trust the people. They are not bigoted or ungenerous. They understand that Britain has responsibilities to those who have been displaced by war or persecution. But they can also read maps. And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when tens of thousands of people are crossing the entire length of the European Continent, travelling through safe countries en route, before suddenly lodging an asylum claim in Britain. And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when desperate people hide in the undercarriage of high speed trains to get through the Channel Tunnel. We will clear up Labour\u0092s asylum mess. We will welcome genuine refugees, but we will be a safe haven not a soft touch. That is not bigotry. It\u0092s plain common sense. People know it. And I trust the people. Above all, the people of Britain believe in their country. They are not narrow nationalists. They are not xenophobes. But they take pride in what our country has achieved. No country has contributed as we have to the freedom of mankind. Through the centuries, we have aligned ourselves with the cause of nationhood everywhere. In the Nineteenth Century, we sponsored the independence of Italy and Greece and Hungary, and we nurtured the freedom of the South American Republics. In the Twentieth Century, we twice fought for the cause of all nations against tyranny. We introduced the world to free trade. We carried law and freedom to new continents. These were our achievements as a sovereign and united country. And they are achievements that we should be proud to teach in our schools. But now we have a government that scorns and despises all the things that have made our country what it is. A government that holds Britishness cheap. You can see it in their failure to defend the Union of the United Kingdom. It is because we believe in the Union that we have accepted the wishes of the peoples of Scotland and Wales to have a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly. But there is a logical consequence, also vital to the survival of the Union. In the opening days of our administration, we will change the rules so that when matters that only affect England come before the House of Commons only MPs from England will vote. And we have a Labour Government that scorns and despises the very Parliament to which they were elected. Prime Minister\u0092s Questions reduced to once a week. The Speaker driven to complain because announcements are being leaked to the press, not made at the Dispatch Box. The Prime Minister and his MPs rarely even in the Chamber. Parliament\u0092s powers parceled out in every direction \u0096 outwards to Brussels, downwards to the devolved assemblies, sideways to our judges through the Human Rights Act. Now, Tony Blair intends to give up the first and greatest of Parliament\u0092s prerogatives, namely the right to control revenue. Within two years of winning an election, Tony Blair would force this country into the euro. It\u0092s true that he\u0092s had to promise us a referendum. But who will set the terms of that referendum? Tony Blair. Who will decide when to hold it? Tony Blair. Who will draft the question? Tony Blair. If anyone believes that we\u0092ll be allowed a free and fair vote, just take a look at the way in which Labour have already rigged the rules. They\u0092ve given themselves the right to use the Government\u0092s resources to push for a \u0093Yes\u0094 vote. They\u0092ve fixed artificial spending limits, to give the \u0093Yes\u0094 campaign a huge financial advantage. They\u0092ve even written in a special exemption so that the \u0093Yes\u0094 campaign can receive money from elsewhere in the EU. They\u0092ll spend every pound they can lay their hands on, until there\u0092s no Pound left at all. And I say to everyone who believes in our country: make no mistake about it, this election is your last chance to keep the Pound. And it\u0092s your last chance to vote for a Britain that still controls its own destiny. Labour and their Liberal lapdogs have said that if they win the election, they will ratify the Nice Treaty, and establish a European constitution and the start of an EU legal system. And they\u0092ll agree t",

I'm pleased that Taste for Wine has avoided the low road. </p> <p>For the time being, at any rate. The dark cloud hanging over the future of Taste for Wine is that the Destination Wine Company isn't the only business that's going places. New owners Pernod Ricard/Diageo have just put Oddbins on the market. Whoever buys it may not wish to continue with Taste for Wine. I can't see Tesco taking the joint venture to its corporate bosom.

The best Chardonnay in the Languedoc. </p> <p><strong> 2000 Gaia Notios Red </strong> (\u00a35.99, Oddbins). A modern Greek red, this is a spicy, fruit-dominated style with sweet, ripe tannins, medium acidity and flavours of blackberry, blackcherries and liquorice. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Clos Malverne Cabernet Sauvignon/Pinotage</strong> (\u00a36.99, Sainsbury's). Made by one of my favourite Cape wineries, this is an intriguing blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinotage.

I'm pleased that Taste for Wine has avoided the low road. For the time being, at any rate. The dark cloud hanging over the future of Taste for Wine is that the Destination Wine Company isn't the only business that's going places. New owners Pernod Ricard/Diageo have just put Oddbins on the market. Whoever buys it may not wish to continue with Taste for Wine. I can't see Tesco taking the joint venture to its corporate bosom. But then I never thought Oddbins and Sainsbury's would get together, either. Perhaps it's time I gave Budweiser another try. Best cellars: Four wines from the Destination range 2000 Los Robles Carmen\u00e8re (\u00a34.99, Sainsbury's). A proper Carmen\u00e8re, as opposed to a 'Merlot', this is a rich, fruity Chilean red with a deep colour, a grassy undertone and a rustic grunt. 1998 James Herrick Domaine de la Motte Chardonnay, Vin de Pays d'Oc (\u00a36.49, Oddbins). This single vineyard unoaked Chardonnay is so good you could mistake it for a Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9. The best Chardonnay in the Languedoc. 2000 Gaia Notios Red (\u00a35.99, Oddbins). A modern Greek red, this is a spicy, fruit-dominated style with sweet, ripe tannins, medium acidity and flavours of blackberry, blackcherries and liquorice. 1998 Clos Malverne Cabernet Sauvignon/Pinotage (\u00a36.99, Sainsbury's). Made by one of my favourite Cape wineries, this is an intriguing blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinotage. As such, it tastes like a cross between a claret and a rich Burgundy, with plenty of oak and notes of green pepper and raspberry.",

      "body": "<p>March hangs over the cook like a black cloud and I am not sure I can take much more rain, wind and Brussels sprouts. Late winter is as low as the cook's year can get. But that is to ignore the watercress, blood oranges, purple sprouting and ice-crisp Jerusalem artichokes that are at their peak right now. Think first of fluffy white farmhouse bread with nothing but mayo and cold, peppery watercress. Then ditch the suburban dinner-party soup with its swirl of cream and chuck rough-torn leaves into golden chicken stock with noodles and lemon instead. Makes a change from coriander. I refuse to faff with the cellophane bags of tangled pre-washed watercress stems and go for great fat bunches wrapped up in a rubber band, hacking off their vital, emerald leaves and tossing them into grapefruit or blood orange salads. The almost-freezing water in which it grows at this time of year boosts the leaves' inherent pepperiness. </p> <p>Winter salads still have a snappy freshness. Try shredded white cabbage with pumpkin seeds and sprouted mung beans, or some of that watercress with finely sliced fennel and a shot of lemon. Spinach is looking good, especially when it is sold with its roots intact. Wash in ice-cold water, then pack it in a plastic bag in the fridge for an hour or two to crisp it up even more. Toss the leaves with matchsticks of salami and fat black grapes. I am afraid you really must seed them. Sloppiness rarely eats well. </p> <p>What is truly new this month is the early season's purple sprouting. Good enough steamed and buttered, it enters another level altogether when served with the Hollandaise sauce normally reserved for asparagus and sole. Even the fattest stalks are tender this early on, but expect to find locally grown available till May, when, conveniently, local asparagus will take over. </p> <p>It is fashionable to treat purple sprouting and its deep-mauve heads like asparagus and I am happy to take some of the blame for that - there are fewer suppers I would rather eat. You need nothing more than a jug of the classic egg yolk and butter sauce and some thin slices of bread and butter. We can smugly discount the amount of cholesterol consumed at one sitting because of the life-enhancing greens it accompanies. </p> <p>Talking of which, the Asian greens, such as pak choi with its Chinese soup spoon-shaped leaves, are well worth casting your eye over. At the risk of being labelled a turncoat by the cream-and-sugar brigade, I have developed an almost missionary zeal about greens. True, I cook most of them in a similar way, throwing them in the steamer (a wannabe Heath-Robinson affair with a colander and a saucepan lid due to friends who have borrowed and failed to return my old Chinese steel steamer) and toss them briefly in hot oyster sauce, sesame oil and garlic. </p> <p>I must say, all the greens are stunning at the moment. Rarely have I seen Savoy cabbages so dark and handsome. I got all geared up to add shredded leaves to a bean and barley soup last week, but so good did they look in the colander, water droplets trapped between their wrinkles, that I just threw them into boiling water and cooked them as they used to at school - only for an hour or two less. The result, squeezed dry and tossed back into the empty pan with the juice of half a lemon and some unsalted butter, made me feel as good as a cook can in this god-awful growing season. </p> <p>As good as curly kale can be, it does make me feel like a donkey chomping a mouthful of thistles. Make it easier to digest by scrupulously pulling the leaves from their thick stems. Not that the stems aren't good, but there is a fibre limit and the leaves' tenderness becomes more apparent when detached. Flash them in boiling, heavily salted water, drain as soon as they are tender, then toss them with a wee drop of sesame oil in which you have briefly popped some black mustard seeds over a moderate heat. Good with cold roast pork, that one. </p> <p>While street markets and farm shops are a must for fat carrots and chunky parsnips for roasting, and firm, ivory-fleshed Jerusalem artichokes and golden swedes for mashing, we must look elsewhere for our culinary excitements. Even the most committed of local shoppers will find their eyes wandering this month. </p> <p>Impatient eaters, bored out of their skull with cabbage and potatoes, will already be toying with the French produce that always comes a good few weeks earlier than ours. Having early sunshine and no floods (friends in the south of France have already phoned to boast they are wearing shorts) means we have a chance to get ourselves, albeit briefly and at a price, out of Brussels sprout hell. I think of these imports as a 'top up' rather than an 'instead of'. If ever there was an excuse for the imported green haricot bean, I suppose this is it. </p> <p>Yesterday I pounced on a supply of tiny, crisp beetroots and turnips barely bigger than marbles like one of those overexcited foodies I am always sniping at. There were glassy, white-tipped French radishes and punchy basil, too. Frankly, the sun was shining for the first time in weeks, and I got an urge for a plate of pasta pesto made with fresh basil rather than the silage they sell in jars. </p> <p>Mashing the basil leaves and pine nuts so early in the year was fun, especially as this cook is 'running in' a beautiful new pestle and mortar, but the garlic was a bit tough and dry and I ended up disappointed. Some might say justly. </p> <p>But enough of the green and the healthy. There is plenty of red meat about, and the last bits of feathered game are unlikely to disappoint if you cook them slow and with enough liquid, but I have been edging toward offal again. Kidneys aren't just for grilling. Have a go at cooking them quickly in butter in a shallow pan with an equal amount of quartered small mushrooms (I put in the fungi first, let it colour, then, while the butter is still fizzing, drop in the halved and cored kidneys). Once they have coloured, lift them from the pan and add a glass of dry Marsala, let it bubble down a bit, then add a few capers and whisk in a thick slice of butter. Return the kidneys and mushrooms to the pan and let them warm through for a minute before seasoning and serving. Try the idea with liver, too. </p> <p>It is easy to overlook the array of cured and smoked delicacies on offer. We have moved on from the days when the choice was ham, tongue or mortadella. Check out the salamis and coppa at Esperya.com, a supremely efficient website that delivers all manner of goodies from Italy for less than a tenner carriage. Now is also the weather for smoky tastes such as mackerel and trout. I skin my mackerel, tear it into thick hunks and toss it in a big white salad bowl with rocket leaves and crisply grilled and crumbled bacon or pancetta. What is it that seems so right about smoky flavours when the weather is cold? Are they a distant reminder of when we had a coal fire burning in the grate? </p> <p>Look out for blood oranges with their garnet-mottled skin - I found organic ones recently at the Sundance Organic Centre in the not-so-fashionable King's Road. (Where, incidentally, you can get a good range of organic mixed peel, dried mango and other good things.) They're full of magenta juice: I sliced them up with nothing but a fat and deeply scented mango. A brightly flavoured salad for a cold day with enough juice to ensure you slurp it from the bowl. </p> <p>The apples and pears are still good for juicing - try a blend of Queen Cox and carrot and look out for the charming orange-flushed Adam's Pippin - but their crunch is starting to tire and most are best in the pot. Take a leaf from the Shaker bakers and make crisps and crumbles, pies and tarts before we are back to the imports. Oh, and catch the last pink-skinned lychees before their season goes. Ignore the silly recipes around and just peel and suck. </p> <p>Those determined to stick with what we can safely call our own might like to try this elegant and quietly restoring leek and artichoke soup I made this week. I am not generally someone who blends soups to a pur\u00e9e, preferring mine knobbly and interesting, but you should do it with this one, the most velvety soup imaginable. </p> <p>Chop and thoroughly rinse 4 medium-sized leeks, then let them cook slowly in a deep pan with a little butter and olive oil. Peel and roughly chop 500g of Jerusalem artichokes and add them to the pot, letting them soften. Pour in 1.5 litres of water and bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes till completely soft. Add a handful of chopped parsley, season generously, then blitz in a blender or food processor till smooth.</p>",

Every time I have driven past it, I have fumed more wretchedly than my old Volvo at the gross stupidity of it; at the contrived smart-arseness of it; at the overall bowdlerisation of the English language that this crass, invented word represents. I could just imagine the marketing man responsible punching the air with joy when the idea first thudded across his cerebellum. 'It's a restaurant. The food's fresh. I know: let's call it a freshtaurant!' As against what, exactly? A staletaurant? A bit-past-its-besttaurant? While the sign remained, I committed myself never to going inside. </p> <p>Then it disappeared, I don't know when. All I know is that recently I found myself a mile past Victoria, realised I wasn't seething any more and that therefore the time had finally come to find out what the hell goes on behind its glass sliding doors. </p> <p>The M\u00f6venpick March\u00e9 Restaurant, as it now describes itself, is situated below ground under the glass-and-steel headquarters of John Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. To all intents and purposes, it is a food court, a vast, tiled, underground space populated by faux market stalls which give way to an eating area designed to look like a faux Italianate villa or a faux galleon or a faux alpine hut. That said, M\u00f6venpick would probably shudder at the term 'food court'. This, they say, is a 'March\u00e9' - which is like a food court, only one owned by Swiss people. </p> <p>It was opened by the Countess of Limerick on 5 September 1995. I know this because there is a sign on the wall which says so. There are lots of signs and notices at M\u00f6venpick. There's the big one listing 'The nine March\u00e9 principles of M\u00f6venpick'. These are intriguing. Number five is: 'Our selection is varied and flexible but deliberately limited', which I suppose counts as getting your apology in first. There's the big police warning poster which reads: 'THIEVES OPERATE IN THIS AREA.' </p> <p>And then there's all the stuff on the back of the customer card which is stamped at each stall so they can keep score of what you've had. One of those clauses says that, should you lose this card, you will be taken out to Victoria Station and shot. OK, what it really says is that, should you lose it, they will hit you for 50 quid, no arguments, no appeals. It is a nice, warm and welcoming way with which to begin a meal. </p> <p>As to the food, it is utterly familiar to anybody who has ever walked about a food court - sorry, March\u00e9 - which is to say, a transcontinental mishmash. One stall has platters of pasta seizing up beneath heat lamps. Another has barbecue chicken and a lump of beef which carved up nice and grey. The real selling point, as the old name suggested, was the fresh stuff: the stall laden with good-looking cuts of raw fish on ice, or the meat stall with sausages and hunks of pork, or the cooking station where they were preparing Dover sole with pale spinach and saffron risotto at \u00a36.55. </p> <p>I passed on all of those and made for the salad bar offering servings of antipasti at \u00a33.95 a pop. One plate contained smoked-salmon parcels. What was in those parcels was not immediately obvious. I asked the woman behind the counter. She muttered something in a foreign tongue. I frowned. She tried again. I was still none the wiser. It wasn't her fault. She had been placed in a position to which her grasp of English was not suited. I went for the peppered smoked mackerel with potato salad which was ready-prepared, sealed tight beneath clingfilm. </p> <p>It tasted like peppered smoked mackerel that had lain beneath clingfilm for too long: it was far too cold, and dull and dry. I didn't finish it. As to my companion - there wasn't one. Sure, announce you have to review some \u00a350-a-head Michelin-starred Italian fusion place and they're down on their knees offering sexual favours. Tell them you have to review a Swiss food court and you can't see them for dust. </p> <p>So I pressed on manfully, alone. Next, I went for a made-to-order rosti with ham and cheese, what with this being a Swiss gaff and all. At \u00a35.55, it was a substantial plateful. The ham was good and solid, and the rosti had a great crispy skin. Beneath this, however, it was a bit soft and squidgy as though it was fried-off mashed potato. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. There's a short wine list - a bit of Merlot, a bit of Pinot Grigio - and a longer list of sugary cocktails which doubtless have been responsible for the over-inebriation of many a Victoria office worker. </p> <p>It was now 1pm and the place was quickly filling up. I tried to work out why. To be absolutely fair, if this were the caf\u00e9 at a motorway service station off the M6, I would be praising it to the stars. There's food of a reasonable quality being served here at reasonable prices, which would be something close to a cultural revolution if ever it were to arrive in, say, Droitwich. But it's not. It's a service station without the motorway, a Travelodge without the beds. Maybe there are people in London who crave the 'Welcome Break' experience without having to drive there. Maybe some of them are civil servants working for the Department of Transport upstairs. Only one thing is certain: I'm not one of them.</p> <p>Contact Jay Rayner on <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

There's the big police warning poster which reads: 'THIEVES OPERATE IN THIS AREA.' And then there's all the stuff on the back of the customer card which is stamped at each stall so they can keep score of what you've had. One of those clauses says that, should you lose this card, you will be taken out to Victoria Station and shot. OK, what it really says is that, should you lose it, they will hit you for 50 quid, no arguments, no appeals. It is a nice, warm and welcoming way with which to begin a meal. As to the food, it is utterly familiar to anybody who has ever walked about a food court - sorry, March\u00e9 - which is to say, a transcontinental mishmash. One stall has platters of pasta seizing up beneath heat lamps. Another has barbecue chicken and a lump of beef which carved up nice and grey. The real selling point, as the old name suggested, was the fresh stuff: the stall laden with good-looking cuts of raw fish on ice, or the meat stall with sausages and hunks of pork, or the cooking station where they were preparing Dover sole with pale spinach and saffron risotto at \u00a36.55. I passed on all of those and made for the salad bar offering servings of antipasti at \u00a33.95 a pop. One plate contained smoked-salmon parcels. What was in those parcels was not immediately obvious. I asked the woman behind the counter. She muttered something in a foreign tongue. I frowned. She tried again. I was still none the wiser. It wasn't her fault. She had been placed in a position to which her grasp of English was not suited. I went for the peppered smoked mackerel with potato salad which was ready-prepared, sealed tight beneath clingfilm. It tasted like peppered smoked mackerel that had lain beneath clingfilm for too long: it was far too cold, and dull and dry. I didn't finish it. As to my companion - there wasn't one. Sure, announce you have to review some \u00a350-a-head Michelin-starred Italian fusion place and they're down on their knees offering sexual favours. Tell them you have to review a Swiss food court and you can't see them for dust. So I pressed on manfully, alone. Next, I went for a made-to-order rosti with ham and cheese, what with this being a Swiss gaff and all. At \u00a35.55, it was a substantial plateful. The ham was good and solid, and the rosti had a great crispy skin. Beneath this, however, it was a bit soft and squidgy as though it was fried-off mashed potato. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. There's a short wine list - a bit of Merlot, a bit of Pinot Grigio - and a longer list of sugary cocktails which doubtless have been responsible for the over-inebriation of many a Victoria office worker. It was now 1pm and the place was quickly filling up. I tried to work out why. To be absolutely fair, if this were the caf\u00e9 at a motorway service station off the M6, I would be praising it to the stars. There's food of a reasonable quality being served here at reasonable prices, which would be something close to a cultural revolution if ever it were to arrive in, say, Droitwich. But it's not. It's a service station without the motorway, a Travelodge without the beds. Maybe there are people in London who crave the 'Welcome Break' experience without having to drive there. Maybe some of them are civil servants working for the Department of Transport upstairs. Only one thing is certain: I'm not one of them. Contact Jay Rayner on jay.rayner@observer.co.uk",

Most would recover if the disease were let to run its natural course. The official arguments in favour of the slaughter policy are entirely economic, and designed to preserve the myth of cheap food and protect the interests of an elite of large-scale farmers. In 2000 the United Kingdom animal-related export trade, in the form of meat, live animals and breeding stock, amounted to more than \u00a31 billion. This is all based on the UK being designated a disease-free zone. This was a policy we persuaded other European governments to adopt in the early 1990s, and to accept mass slaughter as the means to that end. These were also the arguments used by government officials to justify killing 250,000 animals during the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 1922-24, and every outbreak since. Nothing has advanced in government thinking in 80 years, in spite of advances in vaccination and other medical techniques, some of them pioneered at the Government's own specialised FMD laboratory in Pirbright, set up in the wake of the 1922-24 debacle. Indeed, vaccination was adopted by some countries as a means of controlling the disease, but, in the Alice-in-Blunderland world of international trade, the use of vaccination meant losing disease-free status. Just how little official thinking has advanced is scarcely surprising given the cosy relationship between the upper echelons of the farming and food production industries and government departments. For smaller farmers, too, the arguments in favour of slaughter are compelling. Were they allowed to recover, the animals would be thinner and less productive. Profit margins are now so small, the farming industry has no incentive to keep such animals alive, and as farmers get paid compensation for their dead animals, it makes more commercial sense to slaughter them than it does to keep them alive. The commercial imperatives of an \u00e9lite and the deceitful chimera of cheap food have dictated agricultural policy and the structure of farming for 50 years, with devastating consequences for farming, for its products and for us. We consumers have gone along with it, as we have gone along with all the other consequences of cheap-food policies: centralised production and retailing, and the control of the food chain by a few very powerful companies. Bargain-basement beef, nicely trimmed and packaged; cut-price new potatoes in December; and butter-basted chickens at 95p per kg ensure we don't pay too much attention to the means by which these titbits come to us. This situation may be the natural consequence of the drift away from the land to the towns that started in the nineteenth century. Now few people have much idea of how our food is produced, and fewer still care much about it, until some hideous complication like BSE or E.coli comes along to frighten us all.

      "body": "<p>I am always terribly aware of the date at the bottom of this page. Not least because it is not today. I try and throw myself forward the fortnight that divides the delivery and publication of these words, although at this time of year we oscillate wildly between winter and spring through a thousand shades of grey. Maybe I am not enough of a gardener to do 52 timeless horticultural essays, but it pleases me to try and be as pertinent as possible. </p> <p>One of the ways I make sure I am tuning into the right kind of future is by checking back over my garden diaries. I have been keeping these for 13 years, always a desk diary, day to a page, and I try to write the weather, what looks at its best (or worst), what was sown or planted, what was eaten from the garden and what jobs were entrained. Lots of days run to no more than 'wet and grey: indoors all day'. But the picture does emerge over the weeks and months. The jobs you have done assume form and pattern when given a date. For instance, exactly a year ago I moved thalictrums, took melianthus and dahlias cuttings, thinned rocket and planted 150 'Turbo' onion sets. So much for the industry. But the important bit is: 'Primroses in great mounds in coppice and violets extraordinary - never seen anything like it. I hope they last as well over the next few years. Cowslips out - perhaps a dozen or more - weirdly early. Hyacinths in kitchen fabulous. Lonicera fragrantissima good. Lovely dawn - bright, clear, cold. Wonderful sunset.' You can tell that this was written that evening, still glowing from one of the first proper spring days in the garden. </p> <p>The violets are not so good this year. Too much competition from grass, I think. Perhaps they will make a late burst for glory in the space between my fingers writing this and your eyes reading it. And so the same things happen year after year, but happen differently. Every violet or daffodil is the first one ever and every successive year enriches its freshness with experience. </p> <p>These sparse diaries are slyly eloquent about one's life. So, 10 years ago there are just three notes, two seemingly unconnected to gardening but as clear a picture of my garden as a government enquiry. They are: 'Prepare statement of affairs for liquidation meeting'; 'Fax material to Rosie on trees' and 'Hedging pm'. </p> <p>The liquidation meeting was that of our company and was part of the process of losing every material thing that we had. A fortnight earlier, we had sold our house and garden to put into the liquidator's pot and we had moved in, five of us plus two dogs, with my parents-in-law. I was gardenless, sort of. This qualification is because we had retained a field from the sale with the half-baked plan to build a house on it one day. In the event, the house never got past the dreaming stage, but I did dig a patch of it for an allotment that summer, driving the four miles to it after the children had gone to bed. It was lovely. The Rosie in question was Rosie Millard, now in front of camera and microphone as arts correspondent for the BBC, but then a fledgling director for Granada's This Morning . My only source of income at that stage was the sporadic appearance on that show, either filmed or live, and I was desperately trying to drum up enthusiasm for more work from me. In fact, this was to dry up altogether after a few more months and exactly a year later, on 3 March 1992, I have: 'Sign on at New St, Leominster'. </p> <p>But the third entry for 3 March 1991, 'Hedging pm', is the good bit. To preserve my sanity - which is a glib phrase but in those circumstances, entirely accurate - I was laying a long hedge that bounded the field we had retained and the garden we had sold. With hindsight this was a kind of masochism, but it felt completely right and healing at the time. The hedge bounded a small wood and was completely invisible from anywhere other than our field. There was no one to observe me making a fool of myself. It was mainly hawthorn, with some field maple, elder and ash mixed in. I had never attempted to lay a hedge before and had had no instruction. I now know that it was extremely difficult, because it was very overgrown, more a line of small trees than a hedge, but with a chain saw, billhook and ropes, I slowly got it done. It was tricky and dangerous and enormous fun and because I had to concentrate completely in order to do it at all, it eased my mind. Across the field from this garden, a man has laid a similar hedge in half the time I took and with twice the degree of competence. It is a beautiful object. </p> <p>I have not laid a hedge since but have earmarked one in this garden for my next foray into that field and hopefully it will be hedgecraft rather than hedging-as-therapy. The hedge in question is hawthorn and divides the coppice from the orchard. It was planted in the crudest possible manner, by lifting a line of turf and heeling the young plants in slits. The whole operation took two men about an hour. On one side it is 6ft tall and thriving, but on the other, where it skirts around some trees I planted eight years ago, it is stunted and thin. This is because the trees are taking all the moisture and goodness. The moral of the story is that if you want a hedge to grow away strongly, you must remove competition from all weeds. And here, two cherries, a field maple and an ash count as weeds. Anyway, I reckon that the hedge will be ready for laying in five years' time. </p> <p>I have been preoccupied with hedges because we have been planting a whole load down the end of the garden. This area is very loosely orchard but except for a few months in summer, that looseness becomes a ragbag of compost heaps, orchard, chickens, tunnel, borders and play lawn. At best this bit of my garden has vitality, but on a grey, muddy afternoon it is plain ugly. The plan is to integrate them in such a way that the spaces flow together and work independently without losing any of their usefulness. So I have divided up the space, hedging off the lawn with hornbeam so it is still big enough to take a cricket net - without which no garden could possibly be complete - but is enclosed from all but the long central path. A hedge has do one of two things in a garden: either it acts as a frame, or it is a screen. In both cases, it defines space, and the space between plants is always the most important element in any garden. </p> <p>We have also moved apple trees to clear space and concentrate the orchard in a smaller area. We have far too many apples for our needs, and the original planting was, I think, too grand for the space we have available. The upshot is that now we have a more intense space which will eventually need some pruning to contain it, but which still has 30-odd varieties of apple. More hawthorn hedges have been planted to screen off this redefined orchard and flank another path. I plan to extend the coppice where the orchard formally spilled over the main path and box it in with more hawthorn hedge. I particularly like this notion of boxing in areas so the contents spill out like a jack-in-the-box. The hedges need to be kept lower than the contents - not difficult in the case of a wooded area - but they act like a corset, accentuating the voluptuousness of the planting through restriction. </p> <p>I think that most gardens underdo hedges. Even a very small garden can usually be improved by subdivision. Hedges do not have to be four-square. A cloud hedge looks great and hedges can just as easily snake and bend as march in a straight line. The important thing is to get the height right in relation to the space that the hedge bounds. As a rule, most hedges are too low. Just as a high ceiling tends to improve the proportions of a room, so high hedges make a garden seem bigger and more beautiful. And there is the added bonus that the higher and longer your hedges, the more bird life you will have in the garden.</p> <p><strong>Hedge your bets</strong></p> <p>\u0095 If you are planting a deciduous hedge, get on with it as soon as possible. An evergreen one is best planted in April. </p> <p> \u0095 Do not cut corners in preparation. All time, effort or money put into preparing the ground will pay dividends in health and speed of growth. </p> <p> \u0095 Mark out the location of the hedge with canes and string. Remember to allow 1m for its final width, if an enclosure hedge, and half of that if a containing one. </p> <p> \u0095 If you are planting into grass, remove at least three spade-widths of turf along the line of the proposed hedge - 1m is ideal. </p> <p> \u0095 Dig out the top soil one spit deep (a 'spit' is the depth of the spade). This will have to be broken up and used to put back around the roots. </p> <p> \u0095 Fork or dig over the second spit so it is thoroughly loosened and add plenty of compost or manure. </p> <p> \u0095 Buy bare-root plants from a specialist nursery if you can get them (they are much cheaper than plants in a container). Do not be tempted to buy large plants. This is a complete waste of money and only used by contractors to impress their clients. Small plants adapt and grow faster and will make a bigger hedge quicker. When planting, keep the roots covered and damp at all times. This is really important, because if the tiny feeding roots dry out, the plants will be much slower to get going. Before planting, give them a long soak in a bucket. </p> <p> \u0095 Plant deep enough to cover the roots, but do not bury too much of the stem. Planting distances vary but in general a single row with adequate spacing will make a stronger hedge than one planted more thickly. A minimum of 18in is a good rule of thumb for beech, hornbeam and holly, and 12in for hawthorn and box. Yew should be at least 24in apart. </p> <p> \u0095 I delay mulching for a week so the soil can settle a little and I give the hedge another big soak first, then mulch thickly. This is important, as it will stop weeds competing for moisture in the vital first years. Anything will do as long as it is water permeable and stops any light getting through, but obviously compost or manure will feed as well as smother. </p> <p> \u0095 Staking each plant will stop wind rock and help the hedge to grow faster and straighter. </p> <p> \u0095 There is some debate as to the merits and extent of cutting back a hedge after planting. Hawthorn definitely grows denser if cut back by 50 per cent immediately after planting. I have found hornbeam is best left to establish for a couple of years before cutting back by a third. Do not cut the leaders of evergreen hedges until they have reached their intended height but keep the sides cut well back. </p> <p> \u0095 Keep an eye on the hedge for its first year and water if there is no rain for a week. As long as the drainage is good, drought is the biggest hindrance.</p>",

I have been keeping these for 13 years, always a desk diary, day to a page, and I try to write the weather, what looks at its best (or worst), what was sown or planted, what was eaten from the garden and what jobs were entrained. Lots of days run to no more than 'wet and grey: indoors all day'. But the picture does emerge over the weeks and months. The jobs you have done assume form and pattern when given a date. For instance, exactly a year ago I moved thalictrums, took melianthus and dahlias cuttings, thinned rocket and planted 150 'Turbo' onion sets. So much for the industry. But the important bit is: 'Primroses in great mounds in coppice and violets extraordinary - never seen anything like it. I hope they last as well over the next few years. Cowslips out - perhaps a dozen or more - weirdly early. Hyacinths in kitchen fabulous. Lonicera fragrantissima good. Lovely dawn - bright, clear, cold. Wonderful sunset.' You can tell that this was written that evening, still glowing from one of the first proper spring days in the garden. The violets are not so good this year. Too much competition from grass, I think. Perhaps they will make a late burst for glory in the space between my fingers writing this and your eyes reading it. And so the same things happen year after year, but happen differently. Every violet or daffodil is the first one ever and every successive year enriches its freshness with experience. These sparse diaries are slyly eloquent about one's life. So, 10 years ago there are just three notes, two seemingly unconnected to gardening but as clear a picture of my garden as a government enquiry. They are: 'Prepare statement of affairs for liquidation meeting'; 'Fax material to Rosie on trees' and 'Hedging pm'. The liquidation meeting was that of our company and was part of the process of losing every material thing that we had. A fortnight earlier, we had sold our house and garden to put into the liquidator's pot and we had moved in, five of us plus two dogs, with my parents-in-law. I was gardenless, sort of. This qualification is because we had retained a field from the sale with the half-baked plan to build a house on it one day. In the event, the house never got past the dreaming stage, but I did dig a patch of it for an allotment that summer, driving the four miles to it after the children had gone to bed. It was lovely. The Rosie in question was Rosie Millard, now in front of camera and microphone as arts correspondent for the BBC, but then a fledgling director for Granada's This Morning . My only source of income at that stage was the sporadic appearance on that show, either filmed or live, and I was desperately trying to drum up enthusiasm for more work from me. In fact, this was to dry up altogether after a few more months and exactly a year later, on 3 March 1992, I have: 'Sign on at New St, Leominster'. But the third entry for 3 March 1991, 'Hedging pm', is the good bit. To preserve my sanity - which is a glib phrase but in those circumstances, entirely accurate - I was laying a long hedge that bounded the field we had retained and the garden we had sold. With hindsight this was a kind of masochism, but it felt completely right and healing at the time. The hedge bounded a small wood and was completely invisible from anywhere other than our field. There was no one to observe me making a fool of myself. It was mainly hawthorn, with some field maple, elder and ash mixed in. I had never attempted to lay a hedge before and had had no instruction. I now know that it was extremely difficult, because it was very overgrown, more a line of small trees than a hedge, but with a chain saw, billhook and ropes, I slowly got it done. It was tricky and dangerous and enormous fun and because I had to concentrate completely in order to do it at all, it eased my mind. Across the field from this garden, a man has laid a similar hedge in half the time I took and with twice the degree of competence. It is a beautiful object. I have not laid a hedge since but have earmarked one in this garden for my next foray into that field and hopefully it will be hedgecraft rather than hedging-as-therapy. The hedge in question is hawthorn and divides the coppice from the orchard. It was planted in the crudest possible manner, by lifting a line of turf and heeling the young plants in slits. The whole operation took two men about an hour. On one side it is 6ft tall and thriving, but on the other, where it skirts around some trees I planted eight years ago, it is stunted and thin. This is because the trees are taking all the moisture and goodness. The moral of the story is that if you want a hedge to grow away strongly, you must remove competition from all weeds. And here, two cherries, a field maple and an ash count as weeds. Anyway, I reckon that the hedge will be ready for laying in five years' time. I have been preoccupied with hedges because we have been planting a whole load down the end of the garden. This area is very loosely orchard but except for a few months in summer, that looseness becomes a ragbag of compost heaps, orchard, chickens, tunnel, borders and play lawn. At best this bit of my garden has vitality, but on a grey, muddy afternoon it is plain ugly. The plan is to integrate them in such a way that the spaces flow together and work independently without losing any of their usefulness. So I have divided up the space, hedging off the lawn with hornbeam so it is still big enough to take a cricket net - without which no garden could possibly be complete - but is enclosed from all but the long central path. A hedge has do one of two things in a garden: either it acts as a frame, or it is a screen. In both cases, it defines space, and the space between plants is always the most important element in any garden. We have also moved apple trees to clear space and concentrate the orchard in a smaller area. We have far too many apples for our needs, and the original planting was, I think, too grand for the space we have available. The upshot is that now we have a more intense space which will eventually need some pruning to contain it, but which still has 30-odd varieties of apple. More hawthorn hedges have been planted to screen off this redefined orchard and flank another path. I plan to extend the coppice where the orchard formally spilled over the main path and box it in with more hawthorn hedge. I particularly like this notion of boxing in areas so the contents spill out like a jack-in-the-box. The hedges need to be kept lower than the contents - not difficult in the case of a wooded area - but they act like a corset, accentuating the voluptuousness of the planting through restriction. I think that most gardens underdo hedges. Even a very small garden can usually be improved by subdivision. Hedges do not have to be four-square. A cloud hedge looks great and hedges can just as easily snake and bend as march in a straight line. The important thing is to get the height right in relation to the space that the hedge bounds. As a rule, most hedges are too low. Just as a high ceiling tends to improve the proportions of a room, so high hedges make a garden seem bigger and more beautiful. And there is the added bonus that the higher and longer your hedges, the more bird life you will have in the garden. Hedge your bets \u0095 If you are planting a deciduous hedge, get on with it as soon as possible. An evergreen one is best planted in April. \u0095 Do not cut corners in preparation. All time, effort or money put into preparing the ground will pay dividends in health and speed of growth. \u0095 Mark out the location of the hedge with canes and string. Remember to allow 1m for its final width, if an enclosure hedge, and half of that if a containing one. \u0095 If you are planting into grass, remove at least three spade-widths of turf along the line of the proposed hedge - 1m is ideal. \u0095 Dig out the top soil one spit deep (a 'spit' is the depth of the spade). This will have to be broken up and used to put back around the roots. \u0095 Fork or dig over the second spit so it is thoroughly loosened and add plenty of compost or manure. \u0095 Buy bare-root plants from a specialist nursery if you can get them (they are much cheaper than plants in a container). Do not be tempted to buy large plants. This is a complete waste of money and only used by contractors to impress their clients. Small plants adapt and grow faster and will make a bigger hedge quicker. When planting, keep the roots covered and damp at all times. This is really important, because if the tiny feeding roots dry out, the plants will be much slower to get going. Before planting, give them a long soak in a bucket. \u0095 Plant deep enough to cover the roots, but do not bury too much of the stem. Planting distances vary but in general a single row with adequate spacing will make a stronger hedge than one planted more thickly. A minimum of 18in is a good rule of thumb for beech, hornbeam and holly, and 12in for hawthorn and box. Yew should be at least 24in apart. \u0095 I delay mulching for a week so the soil can settle a little and I give the hedge another big soak first, then mulch thickly. This is important, as it will stop weeds competing for moisture in the vital first years. Anything will do as long as it is water permeable and stops any light getting through, but obviously compost or manure will feed as well as smother. \u0095 Staking each plant will stop wind rock and help the hedge to grow faster and straighter. \u0095 There is some debate as to the merits and extent of cutting back a hedge after planting. Hawthorn definitely grows denser if cut back by 50 per cent immediately after planting. I have found hornbeam is best left to establish for a couple of years before cutting back by a third. Do not cut the leaders of evergreen hedges until they have reached their intended height but keep the sides cut well back. \u0095 Keep an eye on the hedge for its first year and water if there is no rain for a week. As long as the drainage is good, drought is the biggest hindrance.",

      "body": "<p>\"As we gather here this weekend, we think of our fellow members and friends who had planned to be with us today in Harrogate, but who have had to remain at home or on their farms.</p> <p>The thoughts and sympathy of the whole Conference are with all those whose livelihoods are at risk from the spread of the foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>The pall of black smoke from the funeral pyres of slaughtered animals across our nation today tells the desperate story of a countryside in crisis.</p> <p>I know from my own constituency that, for farmers already struggling in the depths of the worst agricultural depression for sixty years, this latest blow could not be more cruel or more bitter.</p> <p>We support all the Government is doing to eradicate the disease and we welcome the financial support they have announced.</p> <p>People have responded with calmness and restraint to this crisis. In postponing a protest in which they had invested months of preparation, the hundreds of thousands of people who were due to take part in the Countryside March for Liberty and Livelihood have shown great responsibility and courage.</p> <p>I believe it would show the nation's solidarity with the countryside in this terrible hour if the Government were to suspend consideration of the Hunting Bill in Parliament at least until those who wish to protest against it are free to do so again. This morning we have also heard of a different kind of courage - the courage of one young man in a Burmese jail. James Mawdsley.</p> <p>We heard about his unwavering belief in freedom. We heard of his passionate commitment to democracy and hatred of oppression. We heard of his defiance in the face of the extraordinary efforts made to silence him. And we heard of his pride that he is part of this Conservative family. By his actions James Mawdsley reminded us of all that is best about our Party.</p> <p>We remember the enduring values that have run through two centuries of Tory history. The Tory values that stretch back to the days when Wilberforce freed the slaves, and Pitt led a war against tyranny, and Burke wrote his great tracts and Shaftsbury stood and watched the pauper's funeral and dedicated his life to the poor.</p> <p>The values that animated the Conservative leaders of the Twentieth Century: the leadership of Winston Churchill, the resolve of Margaret Thatcher and the decency of John Major.</p> <p>All of us are proud to be part of this Conservative family. And the values that have shaped our past must also guide our future. The determination to fight for freedom and democracy. The resolve to protect our national independence. The courage to speak the truth in an age of spin and political correctness. The self confidence to fight for our beliefs even when the odds are against us and to fight so hard against those odds that we win. The boldness to fight the next election on the most ambitious Conservative programme for a generation.</p> <p>For we are going to go further than any government has ever gone before to hand back to individuals and families the ability to shape their own lives.</p> <p>At his Party's Spring Conference, Tony Blair said that we were to blame for cynicism about politics. What a typically cynical attack from a man whose entire career has been built on one piece of cynicism after another.</p> <p>When a Cabinet Minister who is sacked for telling lies is re-appointed, in the face of every constitutional convention, only for the same man to be sacked again from the same Cabinet for the same offence by the same Prime Minister - no wonder the public are cynical about politics.</p> <p>When the Lord Chancellor violates the trust of his great office of state to solicit party donations from people whose careers he can control, and then says 'I'm not sorry, and I'd do it again' - no wonder the public think that power has gone to their heads.</p> <p>When we have a Deputy Prime Minister who tells people not to drive cars but has two Jags himself, and where the Minister who tells people not to have two homes turns out to have nine himself - no wonder the public believe politicians are hypocrites.</p> <p>And when the man who holds the highest office in politics will say anything and do anything to stay in power, when he thinks nothing of deceiving the public and Parliament, when he stuffs offices of the Crown with his cronies from Islington, breaking every promise on which he was elected, spinning yet another gimmick and yet another re-announcement in order to disguise his failure to deliver on anything at all - no wonder the public say they don't trust their Government.</p> <p>This morning we read in the papers that, at the last election, the Labour Party hired American students to infiltrate our campaign.</p> <p>Well, we have a confession to make. They weren't the only ones playing that game. We hired a bearded buffoon to infiltrate their campaign. But we never thought in our wildest dreams that he'd end up as Foreign Secretary.</p> <p>None of the worthless promises and miserable failure of Labour's first term compares to what they have in store if we were to let them win again.</p> <p>Just imagine four more years of Labour. Try to picture what our country would look like. Let me take you on a journey to a foreign land - to Britain after a second term of Tony Blair. The Royal Mint melting down pound coins as the euro notes start to circulate. Our currency gone forever.</p> <p>The Chancellor returning from Brussels carrying instructions to raise taxes still further. Control over our own economy given away. The jail doors opening as thousands more serious criminals walk out early to offend again. Police morale at a new low. The price gauge on the petrol pump spinning ever faster as fuel taxes rise still further. Letters arriving on doorsteps cancelling yet another round of hospital operations under a Government that is all spin and no delivery.</p> <p>That's Labour's Britain four years from now.</p> <p>And if there are meant to be so many people enthusiastic for another four years of Labour, how come you never meet any of them?</p> <p>Labour's Britain four years from now. Could anybody stomach it? The Dome still for sale. Peter Mandelson re-appointed to the Cabinet for a fourth time. The Liberals, on the edge of their seats, still convinced that a referendum on proportional representation is just around the corner.</p> <p>We're not going to sit idly by and let this happen to our country.</p> <p>That's why Michael Ancram has prepared us to fight the best organised, most vigorous, most spirited campaign we've ever fought in order to save Britain from this nightmare.</p> <p>We are going to say to all the people who have been hit by Labour's stealth taxes: Can you afford another four years? To all the people who are still waiting for their operation: Can you really wait another four years? To all the people who are still waiting to see a policeman on their street: Can you really wait another four years? To all the parents who are waiting for better education: Can you really wait another four years?</p> <p>So we're ready for the fight. We're ready because of the changes you have made to our Party. We're ready because of the victories that you have won in local and European elections.</p> <p>But above all we're ready to speak for the people of Britain: for the mainstream majority who have no voice, for the hard-working people who feel they are ignored, for the men and women who despair that their country is being taken from them. We are not going to let them down.</p> <p>We're ready and we can win.</p> <p>As the next election draws near, people are beginning only now to focus on what the two parties stand for.</p> <p>Well if there's one thing above all that sets me apart from Tony Blair, it's this: I'm not embarrassed to articulate the instincts of the British people.</p> <p>The governing of this country has drifted far away from the decent, plain speaking common sense of its people. Its time to bring it back. It's time to bring Britain home.</p> <p>We have a Government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs.</p> <p>There is nothing that the British people can talk about, that this Labour Government doesn't deride.</p> <p>Talk about Europe and they call you extreme. Talk about tax and they call you greedy. Talk about crime and they call you reactionary. Talk about asylum and they call you racist. Talk about your nation and they call you Little Englanders.</p> <p>This Government thinks Britain would be alright if only we had a different people. I think Britain would be alright, if only we had a different Government. A Conservative Government that speaks with the voice of the British people. A Conservative Government never embarrassed or ashamed of the British people. A Conservative Government that trusts the people.</p> <p>I trust the people. I trust the people on tax. People know that you can't spend more than you have. And they know that that holds true for governments as well for them. It seems like common sense to you and me. But not to Gordon Brown.</p> <p>He's already running up huge bills on your behalf. He's promising to blow billions of pounds of your money. And what's spent today will have to be paid for tomorrow.</p> <p>With Michael Portillo as Chancellor, Britain will spend no more than it can afford; and Britain will tax no more than it needs.</p> <p>We will scale back the waste and bureaucracy that has grown up like a fungus under this Government. We'll cut the size of Whitehall and cut the number of politicians.</p> <p>I'm going to reduce the size of the Cabinet, cut the number of ministers, reduce the size of the House of Commons, campaign for a European Parliament with 100 fewer members, halve the number of political advisers, and abolish a huge swathe of Labour's regional bureaucracies and agencies - and their offices in Brussels.</p> <p>It is the mission of the next Conservative Government to build the Responsible Society. That's why I want to support the people who are trying to do the right thing.</p> <p>To the hard-working people who set a little bit aside each month, to provide for their children, or to fund their own retirement, I say: you should be rewarded not punished. You should be allowed to keep every penny of the interest on your savings. You've already paid tax on your money once; you shouldn't have to do it twice. We're going to make your savings tax free.</p> <p>And to the pensioners who have paid their contributions throughout their lives, and who now want the dignity of independence, I say: you have already done your bit. You shouldn't have to go on paying. We're going to take a million pensioners out of the tax system altogether.</p> <p>And to the younger people who don't want to rely on the state in their retirement, I say: you should have the opportunity to build up your own pension fund. You should be able to use the National Insurance system to fund your own retirement. We're going to give you the choice we never had to be independent of the Government.</p> <p>And to married couples, struggling and sacrificing to do their best for their children, I say: you are doing the right thing. You are providing the stable homes that children need. Your contribution should be recognised. That's why we're going to introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance - a transferable allowance worth as much as \u00a31000. It's time we had a Government that supported the idea of marriage instead of doing everything it can to undermine it.</p> <p>Spending only what the country can afford, rewarding savings, encouraging independence, supporting marriage: people know that these things are common sense. And I trust the people.</p> <p>And I also trust our doctors and nurses and teachers and policemen. I say let them get on with their jobs without politicians peering over their shoulders.</p> <p>To the teacher weighed down with paperwork, I say: you've been messed around too often. You came into teaching to spend your time teaching children not filling in forms. Listen to Chris Woodhead, the former Chief Inspector of Schools: 'David Blunkett has \u0085 wasted taxpayers' money, distracted teachers from their real responsibilities and encapsulated the worst of the discredited ideology that has done so much damage since the 1960s. He has just not delivered. A generation of children has been betrayed'.</p> <p>The end of term report on a Labour Government. A generation of children has been betrayed.</p> <p>Labour have been listening for too long to the so-called experts who think that competition is a dirty word and that communicating facts to our children is elitist. Well, they've had their chance and, in all too many schools, we can see the result: poor discipline, declining standards and low expectations.</p> <p>Let's not be afraid to speak the common sense truth: you can't have high standards without good discipline.</p> <p>Let's trust the common sense instinct that says that children need a structured day, that heads know most about their own school, and that teachers should be free to get on with teaching.</p> <p>When Theresa May is Education Secretary we're going to set our schools free with their own admissions policies. Parents will get higher standards and a real choice about where to send their children. And teachers who run disciplined classrooms will get our support not end up in court.</p> <p>And what's true for our schools is true for our hospitals. To the patient queuing up even to be allowed on to a waiting list, I say: you've waited long enough. Doctors, not politicians, should decide when you are treated.</p> <p>When Liam Fox is Health Secretary, there'll be guaranteed waiting times and those with the most serious conditions will be treated first. Nurses will be nurses, not pen pushers. And instead of Labour's dogmatic hostility to any form of private medicine, we're going to expand the total health care available in the country by supporting instead of attacking those who take out personal medical insurance.</p> <p>People know that it's just common sense. And I trust the people.</p> <p>And I trust the people on crime. Labour may dismiss the views of the mainstream majority as prejudiced and ignorant. They may scoff at our calls for punishment that fits the crime.</p> <p>But we know, and the British people know, that we will never defeat crime until we put more police on the street and given them the support they need to do their job.</p> <p>It seems common sense to you and me. But Labour, once again, prefers to listen to the self-appointed experts: to the liberal sociologists, who have so much to say about the rights of the criminal, and so little about the rights of the victim.</p> <p>I met a lady a few weeks ago on a housing estate in Newark who said to me: 'I can't remember when I last saw a policeman on my street. And I'm frightened to go out after 5 o'clock'.</p> <p>I say to her: every street should be safe. And to the people who feel that their own town centres are closed to them on a Friday night, I say: we will crack down on violence and yobbery.</p> <p>We will stop releasing prisoners early. We will reverse Labour's cuts in police numbers. We will support our police where Labour has undermined them.</p> <p>And we will take on the compensation culture that pays out thousands of pounds to IRA terrorists who shoot their way out of jail. Such payments insult the victims of terrorism and disgrace our country: I believe it is an outrage.</p> <p>The people of Britain want a Home Secretary who will give them back their streets. They want a Home Secretary who will speak up for the victim, not the criminal. Ann Widdecombe will be that Home Secretary.</p> <p>And it's common sense that when we're dealing with an international trade in asylum seekers, we should make Britain a safe haven not a soft touch.</p> <p>So to the law-abiding citizen, who wants to help those genuinely fleeing persecution, but who also wants fairness in the system, I say: we will sort out the asylum crisis. The next Conservative Government will assess the validity of asylum claims within weeks, not years. And, where applications are unfounded, immediate deportation will follow.</p> <p>This country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice - Conservative Governments always have, and always will. But it's precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside by claimants who have been rehearsed in how to play the system. Once again, Labour despises the opinions of the people it is supposed to represent.</p> <p>But we trust the people. They are not bigoted or ungenerous. They understand that Britain has responsibilities to those who have been displaced by war or persecution. But they can also read maps. And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when tens of thousands of people are crossing the entire length of the European Continent, travelling through safe countries en route, before suddenly lodging an asylum claim in Britain.</p> <p>And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when desperate people hide in the undercarriage of high speed trains to get through the Channel Tunnel.</p> <p>We will clear up Labour's asylum mess. We will welcome genuine refugees, but we will be a safe haven not a soft touch.</p> <p>That is not bigotry. It's plain common sense. People know it. And I trust the people.</p> <p>Above all, the people of Britain believe in their country. They are not narrow nationalists. They are not xenophobes. But they take pride in what our country has achieved.</p> <p>No country has contributed as we have to the freedom of mankind. Through the centuries, we have aligned ourselves with the cause of nationhood everywhere. In the Nineteenth Century, we sponsored the independence of Italy and Greece and Hungary, and we nurtured the freedom of the South American Republics. In the Twentieth Century, we twice fought for the cause of all nations against tyranny.</p> <p>We introduced the world to free trade. We carried law and freedom to new continents. These were our achievements as a sovereign and united country. And they are achievements that we should be proud to teach in our schools.</p> <p>But now we have a government that scorns and despises all the things that have made our country what it is. A government that holds Britishness cheap.</p> <p>You can see it in their failure to defend the Union of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>It is because we believe in the Union that we have accepted the wishes of the peoples of Scotland and Wales to have a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly. But there is a logical consequence, also vital to the survival of the Union.</p> <p>In the opening days of our administration, we will change the rules so that when matters that only affect England come before the House of Commons only MPs from England will vote.</p> <p>And we have a Labour Government that scorns and despises the very Parliament to which they were elected.</p> <p>Prime Minister's Questions reduced to once a week. The Speaker driven to complain because announcements are being leaked to the press, not made at the Dispatch Box. The Prime Minister and his MPs rarely even in the Chamber. Parliament's powers parceled out in every direction - outwards to Brussels, downwards to the devolved assemblies, sideways to our judges through the Human Rights Act. Now, Tony Blair intends to give up the first and greatest of Parliament's prerogatives, namely the right to control revenue.</p> <p>Within two years of winning an election, Tony Blair would force this country into the euro.</p> <p>It's true that he's had to promise us a referendum. But who will set the terms of that referendum? Tony Blair. Who will decide when to hold it? Tony Blair. Who will draft the question? Tony Blair.</p> <p>If anyone believes that we'll be allowed a free and fair vote, just take a look at the way in which Labou r have already rigged the rules.</p> <p>They've given themselves the right to use the Government's resources to push for a \"Yes\" vote. They've fixed artificial spending limits, to give the \"Yes\" campaign a huge financial advantage. They've even written in a special exemption so that the \"Yes\" campaign can receive money from elsewhere in the EU.</p> <p>They'll spend every pound they can lay their hands on, until there's no Pound left at all. And I say to everyone who believes in our country: make no mistake about it, this election is your last chance.</p> <p>If taxes and defence policy and even criminal justice were run from Brussels, what would be left for Westminster? What would be the point of holding elections here?</p> <p>That is why the next election will be different. Because we won't just be voting for the next government. We'll be voting on whether the British Crown in Parliament should remain supreme in Britain. We'll be voting to decide whether our people will remain sovereign their own country.</p>",

The thoughts and sympathy of the whole Conference are with all those whose livelihoods are at risk from the spread of the foot and mouth disease. The pall of black smoke from the funeral pyres of slaughtered animals across our nation today tells the desperate story of a countryside in crisis. I know from my own constituency that, for farmers already struggling in the depths of the worst agricultural depression for sixty years, this latest blow could not be more cruel or more bitter. We support all the Government is doing to eradicate the disease and we welcome the financial support they have announced. People have responded with calmness and restraint to this crisis. In postponing a protest in which they had invested months of preparation, the hundreds of thousands of people who were due to take part in the Countryside March for Liberty and Livelihood have shown great responsibility and courage. I believe it would show the nation's solidarity with the countryside in this terrible hour if the Government were to suspend consideration of the Hunting Bill in Parliament at least until those who wish to protest against it are free to do so again. This morning we have also heard of a different kind of courage - the courage of one young man in a Burmese jail. James Mawdsley. We heard about his unwavering belief in freedom. We heard of his passionate commitment to democracy and hatred of oppression. We heard of his defiance in the face of the extraordinary efforts made to silence him. And we heard of his pride that he is part of this Conservative family. By his actions James Mawdsley reminded us of all that is best about our Party. We remember the enduring values that have run through two centuries of Tory history. The Tory values that stretch back to the days when Wilberforce freed the slaves, and Pitt led a war against tyranny, and Burke wrote his great tracts and Shaftsbury stood and watched the pauper's funeral and dedicated his life to the poor. The values that animated the Conservative leaders of the Twentieth Century: the leadership of Winston Churchill, the resolve of Margaret Thatcher and the decency of John Major. All of us are proud to be part of this Conservative family. And the values that have shaped our past must also guide our future. The determination to fight for freedom and democracy. The resolve to protect our national independence. The courage to speak the truth in an age of spin and political correctness. The self confidence to fight for our beliefs even when the odds are against us and to fight so hard against those odds that we win. The boldness to fight the next election on the most ambitious Conservative programme for a generation. For we are going to go further than any government has ever gone before to hand back to individuals and families the ability to shape their own lives. At his Party's Spring Conference, Tony Blair said that we were to blame for cynicism about politics. What a typically cynical attack from a man whose entire career has been built on one piece of cynicism after another. When a Cabinet Minister who is sacked for telling lies is re-appointed, in the face of every constitutional convention, only for the same man to be sacked again from the same Cabinet for the same offence by the same Prime Minister - no wonder the public are cynical about politics. When the Lord Chancellor violates the trust of his great office of state to solicit party donations from people whose careers he can control, and then says 'I'm not sorry, and I'd do it again' - no wonder the public think that power has gone to their heads. When we have a Deputy Prime Minister who tells people not to drive cars but has two Jags himself, and where the Minister who tells people not to have two homes turns out to have nine himself - no wonder the public believe politicians are hypocrites. And when the man who holds the highest office in politics will say anything and do anything to stay in power, when he thinks nothing of deceiving the public and Parliament, when he stuffs offices of the Crown with his cronies from Islington, breaking every promise on which he was elected, spinning yet another gimmick and yet another re-announcement in order to disguise his failure to deliver on anything at all - no wonder the public say they don't trust their Government. This morning we read in the papers that, at the last election, the Labour Party hired American students to infiltrate our campaign. Well, we have a confession to make. They weren't the only ones playing that game. We hired a bearded buffoon to infiltrate their campaign. But we never thought in our wildest dreams that he'd end up as Foreign Secretary. None of the worthless promises and miserable failure of Labour's first term compares to what they have in store if we were to let them win again. Just imagine four more years of Labour. Try to picture what our country would look like. Let me take you on a journey to a foreign land - to Britain after a second term of Tony Blair. The Royal Mint melting down pound coins as the euro notes start to circulate. Our currency gone forever. The Chancellor returning from Brussels carrying instructions to raise taxes still further. Control over our own economy given away. The jail doors opening as thousands more serious criminals walk out early to offend again. Police morale at a new low. The price gauge on the petrol pump spinning ever faster as fuel taxes rise still further. Letters arriving on doorsteps cancelling yet another round of hospital operations under a Government that is all spin and no delivery. That's Labour's Britain four years from now. And if there are meant to be so many people enthusiastic for another four years of Labour, how come you never meet any of them? Labour's Britain four years from now. Could anybody stomach it? The Dome still for sale. Peter Mandelson re-appointed to the Cabinet for a fourth time. The Liberals, on the edge of their seats, still convinced that a referendum on proportional representation is just around the corner. We're not going to sit idly by and let this happen to our country. That's why Michael Ancram has prepared us to fight the best organised, most vigorous, most spirited campaign we've ever fought in order to save Britain from this nightmare. We are going to say to all the people who have been hit by Labour's stealth taxes: Can you afford another four years? To all the people who are still waiting for their operation: Can you really wait another four years? To all the people who are still waiting to see a policeman on their street: Can you really wait another four years? To all the parents who are waiting for better education: Can you really wait another four years? So we're ready for the fight. We're ready because of the changes you have made to our Party. We're ready because of the victories that you have won in local and European elections. But above all we're ready to speak for the people of Britain: for the mainstream majority who have no voice, for the hard-working people who feel they are ignored, for the men and women who despair that their country is being taken from them. We are not going to let them down. We're ready and we can win. As the next election draws near, people are beginning only now to focus on what the two parties stand for. Well if there's one thing above all that sets me apart from Tony Blair, it's this: I'm not embarrassed to articulate the instincts of the British people. The governing of this country has drifted far away from the decent, plain speaking common sense of its people. Its time to bring it back. It's time to bring Britain home. We have a Government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs. There is nothing that the British people can talk about, that this Labour Government doesn't deride. Talk about Europe and they call you extreme. Talk about tax and they call you greedy. Talk about crime and they call you reactionary. Talk about asylum and they call you racist. Talk about your nation and they call you Little Englanders. This Government thinks Britain would be alright if only we had a different people. I think Britain would be alright, if only we had a different Government. A Conservative Government that speaks with the voice of the British people. A Conservative Government never embarrassed or ashamed of the British people. A Conservative Government that trusts the people. I trust the people. I trust the people on tax. People know that you can't spend more than you have. And they know that that holds true for governments as well for them. It seems like common sense to you and me. But not to Gordon Brown. He's already running up huge bills on your behalf. He's promising to blow billions of pounds of your money. And what's spent today will have to be paid for tomorrow. With Michael Portillo as Chancellor, Britain will spend no more than it can afford; and Britain will tax no more than it needs. We will scale back the waste and bureaucracy that has grown up like a fungus under this Government. We'll cut the size of Whitehall and cut the number of politicians. I'm going to reduce the size of the Cabinet, cut the number of ministers, reduce the size of the House of Commons, campaign for a European Parliament with 100 fewer members, halve the number of political advisers, and abolish a huge swathe of Labour's regional bureaucracies and agencies - and their offices in Brussels. It is the mission of the next Conservative Government to build the Responsible Society. That's why I want to support the people who are trying to do the right thing. To the hard-working people who set a little bit aside each month, to provide for their children, or to fund their own retirement, I say: you should be rewarded not punished. You should be allowed to keep every penny of the interest on your savings. You've already paid tax on your money once; you shouldn't have to do it twice. We're going to make your savings tax free. And to the pensioners who have paid their contributions throughout their lives, and who now want the dignity of independence, I say: you have already done your bit. You shouldn't have to go on paying. We're going to take a million pensioners out of the tax system altogether. And to the younger people who don't want to rely on the state in their retirement, I say: you should have the opportunity to build up your own pension fund. You should be able to use the National Insurance system to fund your own retirement. We're going to give you the choice we never had to be independent of the Government. And to married couples, struggling and sacrificing to do their best for their children, I say: you are doing the right thing. You are providing the stable homes that children need. Your contribution should be recognised. That's why we're going to introduce a new Married Couple's Allowance - a transferable allowance worth as much as \u00a31000. It's time we had a Government that supported the idea of marriage instead of doing everything it can to undermine it. Spending only what the country can afford, rewarding savings, encouraging independence, supporting marriage: people know that these things are common sense. And I trust the people. And I also trust our doctors and nurses and teachers and policemen. I say let them get on with their jobs without politicians peering over their shoulders. To the teacher weighed down with paperwork, I say: you've been messed around too often. You came into teaching to spend your time teaching children not filling in forms. Listen to Chris Woodhead, the former Chief Inspector of Schools: 'David Blunkett has \u0085 wasted taxpayers' money, distracted teachers from their real responsibilities and encapsulated the worst of the discredited ideology that has done so much damage since the 1960s. He has just not delivered. A generation of children has been betrayed'. The end of term report on a Labour Government. A generation of children has been betrayed. Labour have been listening for too long to the so-called experts who think that competition is a dirty word and that communicating facts to our children is elitist. Well, they've had their chance and, in all too many schools, we can see the result: poor discipline, declining standards and low expectations. Let's not be afraid to speak the common sense truth: you can't have high standards without good discipline. Let's trust the common sense instinct that says that children need a structured day, that heads know most about their own school, and that teachers should be free to get on with teaching. When Theresa May is Education Secretary we're going to set our schools free with their own admissions policies. Parents will get higher standards and a real choice about where to send their children. And teachers who run disciplined classrooms will get our support not end up in court. And what's true for our schools is true for our hospitals. To the patient queuing up even to be allowed on to a waiting list, I say: you've waited long enough. Doctors, not politicians, should decide when you are treated. When Liam Fox is Health Secretary, there'll be guaranteed waiting times and those with the most serious conditions will be treated first. Nurses will be nurses, not pen pushers. And instead of Labour's dogmatic hostility to any form of private medicine, we're going to expand the total health care available in the country by supporting instead of attacking those who take out personal medical insurance. People know that it's just common sense. And I trust the people. And I trust the people on crime. Labour may dismiss the views of the mainstream majority as prejudiced and ignorant. They may scoff at our calls for punishment that fits the crime. But we know, and the British people know, that we will never defeat crime until we put more police on the street and given them the support they need to do their job. It seems common sense to you and me. But Labour, once again, prefers to listen to the self-appointed experts: to the liberal sociologists, who have so much to say about the rights of the criminal, and so little about the rights of the victim. I met a lady a few weeks ago on a housing estate in Newark who said to me: 'I can't remember when I last saw a policeman on my street. And I'm frightened to go out after 5 o'clock'. I say to her: every street should be safe. And to the people who feel that their own town centres are closed to them on a Friday night, I say: we will crack down on violence and yobbery. We will stop releasing prisoners early. We will reverse Labour's cuts in police numbers. We will support our police where Labour has undermined them. And we will take on the compensation culture that pays out thousands of pounds to IRA terrorists who shoot their way out of jail. Such payments insult the victims of terrorism and disgrace our country: I believe it is an outrage. The people of Britain want a Home Secretary who will give them back their streets. They want a Home Secretary who will speak up for the victim, not the criminal. Ann Widdecombe will be that Home Secretary. And it's common sense that when we're dealing with an international trade in asylum seekers, we should make Britain a safe haven not a soft touch. So to the law-abiding citizen, who wants to help those genuinely fleeing persecution, but who also wants fairness in the system, I say: we will sort out the asylum crisis. The next Conservative Government will assess the validity of asylum claims within weeks, not years. And, where applications are unfounded, immediate deportation will follow. This country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice - Conservative Governments always have, and always will. But it's precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside by claimants who have been rehearsed in how to play the system. Once again, Labour despises the opinions of the people it is supposed to represent. But we trust the people. They are not bigoted or ungenerous. They understand that Britain has responsibilities to those who have been displaced by war or persecution. But they can also read maps. And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when tens of thousands of people are crossing the entire length of the European Continent, travelling through safe countries en route, before suddenly lodging an asylum claim in Britain. And they can tell that something is going badly wrong when desperate people hide in the undercarriage of high speed trains to get through the Channel Tunnel. We will clear up Labour's asylum mess. We will welcome genuine refugees, but we will be a safe haven not a soft touch. That is not bigotry. It's plain common sense. People know it. And I trust the people. Above all, the people of Britain believe in their country. They are not narrow nationalists. They are not xenophobes. But they take pride in what our country has achieved. No country has contributed as we have to the freedom of mankind. Through the centuries, we have aligned ourselves with the cause of nationhood everywhere. In the Nineteenth Century, we sponsored the independence of Italy and Greece and Hungary, and we nurtured the freedom of the South American Republics. In the Twentieth Century, we twice fought for the cause of all nations against tyranny. We introduced the world to free trade. We carried law and freedom to new continents. These were our achievements as a sovereign and united country. And they are achievements that we should be proud to teach in our schools. But now we have a government that scorns and despises all the things that have made our country what it is. A government that holds Britishness cheap. You can see it in their failure to defend the Union of the United Kingdom. It is because we believe in the Union that we have accepted the wishes of the peoples of Scotland and Wales to have a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly. But there is a logical consequence, also vital to the survival of the Union. In the opening days of our administration, we will change the rules so that when matters that only affect England come before the House of Commons only MPs from England will vote. And we have a Labour Government that scorns and despises the very Parliament to which they were elected. Prime Minister's Questions reduced to once a week. The Speaker driven to complain because announcements are being leaked to the press, not made at the Dispatch Box. The Prime Minister and his MPs rarely even in the Chamber. Parliament's powers parceled out in every direction - outwards to Brussels, downwards to the devolved assemblies, sideways to our judges through the Human Rights Act. Now, Tony Blair intends to give up the first and greatest of Parliament's prerogatives, namely the right to control revenue. Within two years of winning an election, Tony Blair would force this country into the euro. It's true that he's had to promise us a referendum. But who will set the terms of that referendum? Tony Blair. Who will decide when to hold it? Tony Blair. Who will draft the question? Tony Blair. If anyone believes that we'll be allowed a free and fair vote, just take a look at the way in which Labou r have already rigged the rules. They've given themselves the right to use the Government's resources to push for a \"Yes\" vote. They've fixed artificial spending limits, to give the \"Yes\" campaign a huge financial advantage. They've even written in a special exemption so that the \"Yes\" campaign can receive money from elsewhere in the EU. They'll spend every pound they can lay their hands on, until there's no Pound left at all. And I say to everyone who believes in our country: make no mistake about it, this election is your last chance. If taxes and defence policy and even criminal justice were run from Brussels, what would be left for Westminster? What would be the point of holding elections here? That is why the next election will be different. Because we won't just be voting for the next government. We'll be voting on whether the British Crown in Parliament should remain supreme in Britain. We'll be voting to decide whether our people will remain sovereign their own country.",

      "body": "<p>Red Nose Day is less than two weeks away and the country is gearing up for the eight-hour orgy of TV comedy and countrywide pranks that mark the return of one of the zanier dates in our biannual calendar. Racy Porsche drivers in the city are getting ready to 'Say Pants To Poverty' and Anthea Turner has briefly taken up residence in the Big Brother house. </p> <p>We love a good charity. There's something about phoning in our credit-card donation or putting a pound in a collection box that makes us feel good about ourselves. Yet the appearance of increasing numbers of the recipients of the same generosity on British soil has ignited a blaze of indignation. No wonder Comic Relief tends to focus its appeals on heart-rending pictures from abroad. Yet since its inception in 1985, a third of all money raised has gone to charities in this country. These tend not to be as popular with givers. Battered wives, the homeless, children with Aids, drug addicts and that least-deserving of causes: the asylum seeker. </p> <p>Britons today are a nation of enthusiastic pen pals who can't cope with the prospect of a face-to-face encounter. We'll do bizarre and humiliating things for Comic Relief, drop off excess clothing to Oxfam after an earthquake and protest against torture, dictatorships and war. Yet the sight of a victim of any of the world's injustices holding out a begging bowl outside our supermarkets throws us into paroxysms of outrage. The same Kosovan children we coo over on television are clambering off lorries outside Dover with only the clothes they're wearing. The same victims of the war in Sierra Leone or Saddam's regime wander the streets empty-pocketed as they await the decisions on sanctuary meted out by the Home Office. Apparently we are under siege from money-grabbing foreigners looking for a cushy life in the UK. Call me naive, but if someone is prepared to risk life and limb travelling across Europe in a refrigerated lorry for the sake of \u00a336 in vouchers a week and a grotty room in a hostel, things can't be too good at home. </p> <p>Yet among the cacophony of voices raised in political point-scoring, the rarest to be heard are those of the asylum seekers themselves. Which is why, on a beautiful late February day I find myself in the large common room which forms the Refugee Council's One Stop Service in Brixton, south London. There's a homely smell of cooking; people sit alone on plastic chairs or clustered in little groups. Some look up and smile shyly as I enter the room. It's not hard to recognise the outsider. Being fair-skinned and blonde makes me an incongruous racial type in any gathering of the world's oppressed and dispossessed. In a far corner, a bunch of toddlers play on a plastic frame - the solitary indication that this is the children's section of the room. To my right a group of silent African women sit together. A pretty woman in a plum-coloured hat beams as she talks on a mobile phone. Later I discover why she's so happy to be here. For now, she's the perfect example of what's unacceptable in an asylum seeker. As Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee Council puts it: 'The ideal refugee is shabby but not scruffy. They don't carry a mobile phone and they survive on nothing but fresh, British, democratic air.' </p> <p> The Observer photographer's job is more difficult than mine. People are happy to talk - some are desperate to - but when it comes to posing on film, they politely decline. I presume it's because of their fear of repercussions for loved ones at home. For some that is the case, but for most it's the stigma and possibility of harassment here if they're identified as refugees. One of the escalating problems the Refugee Council is facing is the violence meted out to asylum seekers. Matters have not been helped by the policy of dispersing them around the country. In principle, the plan had much to recommend it. In reality, there are cities where it's easy to disappear into the local cultural melting pot, but there are many where a foreign face is exactly that. And not welcome. </p> <p>After listening to the tales of what these people are escaping from, their treatment in this country becomes an even more acute embarrassment. Take Titi, the hat-wearing 30-year-old from West Africa. Her boyfriend became involved in one of the rebel groups in Sierra Leone. He left her, two months pregnant, promising to return in a week. On the day he left, members of a rival group beat her so badly she lost her baby and an eye. They then took her captive and held her for two years. She was repeatedly raped by the group's leader and during his 'thieving or killing trips' used by a succession of other men who promised to facilitate her escape in exchange for sex. Finally, one of them found her passage on a ship from Freetown. After 21 days in the hold with no idea of her destination and surviving on a diet of rotten vegetables and a mixture of fresh and sea water, she arrived in Dover. After nine months, she's still waiting to see if her application will be successful. And yet she is thankful. 'It's better here. I don't hear firing every night and sometimes I sleep without nightmares.' It's a far cry from the days when she owned a shop selling her batik designs and proudly 'wore 9ct gold to the market, but never anything but 18ct to go out!' </p> <p>Arlette's father was an opposition politician in Cameroon and she was in her final year of nursing studies. One night, men in masks beat her father to death with sticks on the doorstep of her home. When her brother went to file a complaint, he was arrested. Her mother helped her to escape the country and, a year ago, she found herself on a plane via Lagos to Heathrow. </p> <p>French-speaking, with just two pairs of knickers and a jumper in her backpack and no money, she passes through passport control and asks the first person she sees where she should register as an asylum seeker. There being no obvious instructions at any of our airports. Arlette is lucky: the woman she approaches offers her a bed. On the Monday morning, her helper takes her to Lambeth Council, where her application is registered, and she is sent to the One Stop Centre. She's accommodated in a dingy hostel in the Elephant and Castle. A doctor's appointment is also arranged because Arlette is experiencing severe nausea. The doctor tells her it's the result of 'jet lag' and prescribes antibiotics. Two weeks later, her symptoms have become more severe. A second doctor tells her she's pregnant. Lonely and terrified, she returns to the hostel and contemplates suicide. Her only salvation is a worker at the Refugee Council called Isobel who lends a friendly ear, and the One Stop Centre where she attends English classes. Her baby Ilaria is now four months old and Arlette is still waiting for news of her application. The only word from home came a week ago when she found out her brother had 'died' in custody. When I ask Arlette how she feels about her experience as an asylum seeker, she breaks down. 'I never imagined in all my life that I would be treated like a beggar. I come from a good family, but here I am worse than nothing. I am ashamed every day_' She can't continue through her sobs. </p> <p>A line of people is now forming to tell their stories. Alphonse Bartson was orphaned by the war in Rwanda. He came here at the age of 12. His is one of the happier stories. Having won his asylum application, he was educated in the UK and is now a project worker for the Refugee Council. Rose, a fellow Rwandan for whom he is translating today, is one of the saddest. A nervous woman, she stares constantly down at her twitching hands. Her husband and parents were murdered in front of her eyes and she fled the country with just one of her four children. The rest are scattered among friends and she can only hope they are still alive. Rose has just had her application turned down. Not because her case is questionable, but thanks to the 'non-compliance' regulations. If forms are not filled in on time or appointments not kept, applications are automatically refused. Timetables must be hard to keep when you are being moved around, don't speak English, don't have a telephone and often don't even have change for a bus. </p> <p>Rose was in a hospital being treated for cancer when her Home Office appointment came up. Despite a doctor's letter informing the authorities she was bedridden in hospital - a letter they say they never received - her non-appearance was deemed reason to return her to Rwanda. Her cancer has meanwhile returned, but because of her appeal situation, Alphonse is finding it impossible to get her treatment. He tells me he fears she will die if she is not hospitalised. Tears well up in the corners of his eyes, and I am overcome with fury. </p> <p>The last decade has seen bloody war and upheaval in many parts of the globe. As a result, the influx of refugees to the countries they deem 'safe' is at an all-time high. I read outraged reports in newspapers telling us that we have become a 'more popular destination than Germany for refugees seeking asylum'. Would we wish it any other way? </p> <p>At the beginning of this new millennium, we are lucky enough to be a first-world country with a booming economy and a population of nearly 60m. At the Daily Mail 's worst estimate, there are 200,000 asylum seekers. It's hardly an invasion. Refugees make up 0.4 per cent of our population and frequently take on the menial jobs most of us prefer not to do. We have enjoyed sharing the glory with those whose children go on to achieve success in this country. Where would Britart be without Charles Saatchi, the fashion world without John Galliano, 80s pop music without the legacy of Freddie Mercury, literature without Salman Rushdie? Newcomer Zadie Smith won awards for her debut novel White Teeth last year - a timely celebration of the rich diversity of multicultural Britain. </p> <p>Denise Lewis and Linford Christie may not be descended from a long line of Anglo Saxons, but we are proud of their successes. The other day, I met a Bosnian woman who came here as a refugee and has just earned a double first at Cambridge. Immigrants grab hold of the second chance they are given and make something of their lives. We should be proud our country has the wherewithal to offer them that opportunity and a reputation as an oasis of justice. For once, let's celebrate and live up to that image. </p> <p>Comic Relief has every reason to be proud of the money it's donating to enable refugees to lead better and more rewarding lives in this country. Isn't it time we told them so?</p> <p>\u0095 Red Nose Day is 16 March.

Which is why, on a beautiful late February day I find myself in the large common room which forms the Refugee Council's One Stop Service in Brixton, south London. There's a homely smell of cooking; people sit alone on plastic chairs or clustered in little groups. Some look up and smile shyly as I enter the room. It's not hard to recognise the outsider. Being fair-skinned and blonde makes me an incongruous racial type in any gathering of the world's oppressed and dispossessed. In a far corner, a bunch of toddlers play on a plastic frame - the solitary indication that this is the children's section of the room. To my right a group of silent African women sit together. A pretty woman in a plum-coloured hat beams as she talks on a mobile phone. Later I discover why she's so happy to be here. For now, she's the perfect example of what's unacceptable in an asylum seeker. As Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee Council puts it: 'The ideal refugee is shabby but not scruffy. They don't carry a mobile phone and they survive on nothing but fresh, British, democratic air.' The Observer photographer's job is more difficult than mine. People are happy to talk - some are desperate to - but when it comes to posing on film, they politely decline. I presume it's because of their fear of repercussions for loved ones at home. For some that is the case, but for most it's the stigma and possibility of harassment here if they're identified as refugees. One of the escalating problems the Refugee Council is facing is the violence meted out to asylum seekers. Matters have not been helped by the policy of dispersing them around the country. In principle, the plan had much to recommend it. In reality, there are cities where it's easy to disappear into the local cultural melting pot, but there are many where a foreign face is exactly that. And not welcome. After listening to the tales of what these people are escaping from, their treatment in this country becomes an even more acute embarrassment. Take Titi, the hat-wearing 30-year-old from West Africa. Her boyfriend became involved in one of the rebel groups in Sierra Leone. He left her, two months pregnant, promising to return in a week. On the day he left, members of a rival group beat her so badly she lost her baby and an eye. They then took her captive and held her for two years. She was repeatedly raped by the group's leader and during his 'thieving or killing trips' used by a succession of other men who promised to facilitate her escape in exchange for sex. Finally, one of them found her passage on a ship from Freetown. After 21 days in the hold with no idea of her destination and surviving on a diet of rotten vegetables and a mixture of fresh and sea water, she arrived in Dover. After nine months, she's still waiting to see if her application will be successful. And yet she is thankful. 'It's better here. I don't hear firing every night and sometimes I sleep without nightmares.' It's a far cry from the days when she owned a shop selling her batik designs and proudly 'wore 9ct gold to the market, but never anything but 18ct to go out!' Arlette's father was an opposition politician in Cameroon and she was in her final year of nursing studies. One night, men in masks beat her father to death with sticks on the doorstep of her home. When her brother went to file a complaint, he was arrested. Her mother helped her to escape the country and, a year ago, she found herself on a plane via Lagos to Heathrow. French-speaking, with just two pairs of knickers and a jumper in her backpack and no money, she passes through passport control and asks the first person she sees where she should register as an asylum seeker. There being no obvious instructions at any of our airports. Arlette is lucky: the woman she approaches offers her a bed. On the Monday morning, her helper takes her to Lambeth Council, where her application is registered, and she is sent to the One Stop Centre. She's accommodated in a dingy hostel in the Elephant and Castle. A doctor's appointment is also arranged because Arlette is experiencing severe nausea. The doctor tells her it's the result of 'jet lag' and prescribes antibiotics. Two weeks later, her symptoms have become more severe. A second doctor tells her she's pregnant. Lonely and terrified, she returns to the hostel and contemplates suicide. Her only salvation is a worker at the Refugee Council called Isobel who lends a friendly ear, and the One Stop Centre where she attends English classes. Her baby Ilaria is now four months old and Arlette is still waiting for news of her application. The only word from home came a week ago when she found out her brother had 'died' in custody. When I ask Arlette how she feels about her experience as an asylum seeker, she breaks down. 'I never imagined in all my life that I would be treated like a beggar. I come from a good family, but here I am worse than nothing. I am ashamed every day_' She can't continue through her sobs. A line of people is now forming to tell their stories. Alphonse Bartson was orphaned by the war in Rwanda. He came here at the age of 12. His is one of the happier stories. Having won his asylum application, he was educated in the UK and is now a project worker for the Refugee Council. Rose, a fellow Rwandan for whom he is translating today, is one of the saddest. A nervous woman, she stares constantly down at her twitching hands. Her husband and parents were murdered in front of her eyes and she fled the country with just one of her four children. The rest are scattered among friends and she can only hope they are still alive. Rose has just had her application turned down. Not because her case is questionable, but thanks to the 'non-compliance' regulations. If forms are not filled in on time or appointments not kept, applications are automatically refused. Timetables must be hard to keep when you are being moved around, don't speak English, don't have a telephone and often don't even have change for a bus. Rose was in a hospital being treated for cancer when her Home Office appointment came up. Despite a doctor's letter informing the authorities she was bedridden in hospital - a letter they say they never received - her non-appearance was deemed reason to return her to Rwanda. Her cancer has meanwhile returned, but because of her appeal situation, Alphonse is finding it impossible to get her treatment. He tells me he fears she will die if she is not hospitalised. Tears well up in the corners of his eyes, and I am overcome with fury. The last decade has seen bloody war and upheaval in many parts of the globe. As a result, the influx of refugees to the countries they deem 'safe' is at an all-time high. I read outraged reports in newspapers telling us that we have become a 'more popular destination than Germany for refugees seeking asylum'. Would we wish it any other way? At the beginning of this new millennium, we are lucky enough to be a first-world country with a booming economy and a population of nearly 60m. At the Daily Mail 's worst estimate, there are 200,000 asylum seekers. It's hardly an invasion. Refugees make up 0.4 per cent of our population and frequently take on the menial jobs most of us prefer not to do. We have enjoyed sharing the glory with those whose children go on to achieve success in this country. Where would Britart be without Charles Saatchi, the fashion world without John Galliano, 80s pop music without the legacy of Freddie Mercury, literature without Salman Rushdie? Newcomer Zadie Smith won awards for her debut novel White Teeth last year - a timely celebration of the rich diversity of multicultural Britain. Denise Lewis and Linford Christie may not be descended from a long line of Anglo Saxons, but we are proud of their successes. The other day, I met a Bosnian woman who came here as a refugee and has just earned a double first at Cambridge. Immigrants grab hold of the second chance they are given and make something of their lives. We should be proud our country has the wherewithal to offer them that opportunity and a reputation as an oasis of justice. For once, let's celebrate and live up to that image. Comic Relief has every reason to be proud of the money it's donating to enable refugees to lead better and more rewarding lives in this country. Isn't it time we told them so? \u0095 Red Nose Day is 16 March. Comic Relief donation hotline: 08457 910 910; donate online at www.comicrelief.com.",

      "trailText": "<p>Rupert Murdoch is 70 next week. He's always been the enemy, says  Peter Preston , but had he not existed we would have had to invent him</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Three score years and ten. It has become the late autumn of life, the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness when judges take their port and ex-ministers doze on the Lords' red benches. It is, in turn, a time that invites mellower verdicts on lives of toil. And Keith Rupert Murdoch is 70 this week. </p> <p>I never thought to write this piece through his first 69 years. He was, in so many ways, the enemy: Rupert the Barbarian, laying waste established orders, debasing the currency of journalism, bending politicians to his right-wing agenda, marching ever on towards international domination. But there he sits now, in a New York apartment or Bel Air mansion, tended by a fierce young wife, and the balance has changed. We are nearer, far nearer, to the end of empire. We can see him whole. </p> <p>He does not travel as much as he did. He is frailer, feeling the first pangs of mortality. His mind is much on the division of spoils among his family; the crown for Lachlan, the consolation prizes for James and Elisabeth. Meanwhile, the world he would rule has changed around him and his aura of infallibility has gone. He got the internet revolution wrong not once but twice; too late into the game, too slow to see that the tide had ebbed. </p> <p>He must fight to survive against new foes he barely saw coming like AOL-Time Warner and Disney and Seagram. The predatory French of Vivendi snap at his heels. This jungle is suddenly full of big beasts. </p> <p> That does not mean he has stopped. To the contrary, a deal to create a truly global satellite business - and a company worth $70 billion - hovers between glorious conclusion and ignominious collapse. He has staked out a unique position in the wars of digital supremacy, and he may well be right. But one other thing is also clear. These are the coming thirty-year wars, perhaps even 100-year wars. He will not be around to hail victory. He leaves that to future generations - and maybe, as he looks around at other media dynasties, he shivers a little. Whatever became of the Los Angeles Times Chandlers or Roy Thomson's newspaper legacy? Sold off because the heirs and successors weren't interested. The hereditary principle is only as good as heredity's next spin of the wheel. Does he feel lucky? </p> <p>So, at 70, you can ask a different question. What would our world have been like without Rupert Murdoch? What if he had never been born or had carved out some modest Australian, beer-swilling career amid the debris of his own father's newspaper holdings? </p> <p>A kinder, gentler place shot sweetly through with liberal values? Perhaps: but don't bank on it. The Sun he bought long ago from Hugh Cudlipp was a misbegotten creation heading straight for the abattoir. He saved it, changed it and built it. The News of the World always came seedy side up, prurience with your Sunday roast. And what would have happened if Ken Thomson had hung on to the Times and Sunday Times ? Nothing good. Young Ken had no relish for printers' ink. They would have been cut adrift anyway - and who can tell what would have become of them? </p> <p>I was there with a Guardian bid, talking to Harry Evans, and I still feel sore. But I also note that the people who want to buy national papers today are called Hinduja or Richard Desmond. There's no queue of saints with open chequebooks waiting at the door. </p> <p>Murdoch is a newspaperman, which is something for other newspapermen to remember and value. He knows about readers and what, for good or ill, they want. (If there had been no Sun, then millions of its readers would not have read anything.) He is no bean counter. He supports and attempts to resuscitate loss-making papers instinctively; not just the Times, but the New York Post. </p> <p>He fights almost to the death rather than succumb. He gambles relentlessly on his own judgment. These are not minor virtues, and they belong to the world that surrounds us rather than the world we might wish to invent. Was there, in truth, any other option but the realpolitik of Wapping? If we're honest, we know the answer is no - and that there would be many fewer papers today without that stand. Was even the price war of the nineties as deplorable as those of us in its gale force path felt at the time? It had, in retrospect, one thing going for it that we all missed: newspapers had become too expensive, the automatic ratchet of annual price increases too cosy. He made us stop and think. And we are all still here. </p> <p>Many of Rupert's dragons, in short, were ripe for the slaying. The effete, pompous launchers of BSB deserved their come-uppance from Sky. The print unions had forgotten how to compromise. The old mass market tabloids had lost touch with the masses. Football was another revolution waiting to begin, held back by the inertia of the clubs and (yes!) the BBC. Lament away if you like, but never forget the alternatives. </p> <p>His Twentieth Century Fox is no better and no worse than any other big Hollywood studio, but Fox Searchlight makes many distinguished small-budget movies. His Fox TV network, again, neither leads nor trails the rest, but its local news operations are often better. I would miss Sky News now: it is a public service. God bless the Simpsons. </p> <p>And some of the grander arguments, too, are beginning to chase their own tails. Is the Sun too powerful for its own or anyone else's good? Yes, when you find prime ministers fawning after it: no, when Blair had to be endorsed last time - as he will be next time - because the electorate had made up its mind anyway and no cocky newspaper, clutching its mystique, can afford solemnly to advise its worshippers to do something they have no intention of doing. There's a thin line between swagger and cringe. </p> <p>What remains of the Murdoch press (a distinctly non-global entity) isn't half as powerful as it likes to think, nor rigorously uniform in the lines it peddles. Matthew Parris, Simon Jenkins and Anatole Kaletsky sing from different Times hymn sheets: Jack Newfeld and Douglas Montero in the Post might transfer to the New York Times overnight. Sure, the British quartet don't like Europe (a following as well as a leading of readers, again) just as Rupert doesn't like Europe or its regulation of media entrepreneurs: but they don't like William Hague either. The Times has probably become his most implacable critic. </p> <p>What looks wrong in a British context, moreover, can look right in an American one. New York is a Democrat city which the NY Times dominates with its own accepted, sometimes sonorous, wisdom. The town needs a feisty, right-wing tabloid to shake it up, to have a debate. There Rupert is the lonely voice doing blue-collar people's business. Opinion needs a voice or becomes frustration. </p> <p>Even Murdoch's more notorious sell-outs have their ambivalencies. Was he brave, a few years back, when Beijing wanted BBC World Service TV off his Asian Star satellite? Not brave at all: he wimped out. Why, for that matter, does he so despise the Dalai Lama? Yet such feebleness also tells us that he can't command regimes at a snap of his fingers, that he has to trim and ingratiate like all those around him who want to make money in China. And we ought, in fairness, to wonder who else in similar circumstances would have proved so much bolder? </p> <p>Satellite TV business is, of its nature, multinational business - and those knocking on China's door don't call the shots. One day China will be a real superpower of twenty-first century commerce; perhaps the new supreme power. But for the moment it is inching along that road, censoring its internet offerings, watching the programmes that are beamed from its skies. You can sit this one out if it gags in your throat, or you can bob and weave in the conviction that the process of opening up is on your side. A debate about ways and means, not between black and white. </p> <p>Thus to the next, and maybe last, great adventure: Rupert's problematical and pending merger with DirecTV, the building of the world's first global satellite service covering Asia, Europe, North and South America. A dream of 10 years coming to final fruition. Untold riches as a glint in the eye. Yet here again the gamble is great and the odds on success little better than even. Will satellite in the ultimate analysis be able to match what cable and broadband telephone can provide? He may believe that; millions don't. The fight is already a bloody one that reveals what you might call the real continuing curse of Murdoch. For a man worth $9 billion or so, he's always curiously short of ready money, and seems so again. He almost stumbled 10 years ago. He found heavy weather through 2000, and, for all the vaulting ambition of the moment, has a hiring freeze in place. The core businesses he leaves behind never seem to make quite enough to reduce the ocean of debt News Corp has grown accustomed to. </p> <p>Is BSkyB a cash cow? No, the digital frenzy pushed it deep into a loss. Does the Star over Asia show a profit? Not yet, not yet. Will any merger with DirecTV generate enough investment to see off America's cable and broadband giants? Billions will be torn up in the attempt, win or lose (and the fact that he has Bill Gates, another misser of the internet bus, in his corner does not precisely reassure). </p> <p>But here, even in triumph, is the way that empire ends in any case. The intricate, tax-defraying nature of News Corp has become too much of a personal tangle. Does anyone, apart from Rupert, really understand it? We're into an unbundling of flotations that started last year with Sky Global Networks, stalled, and will succeed now only if there is something to succeed with. The future, more and more, rests with separate, shared enterprises able to attract their own flows of investment rather than wallow in the general maw. What price, one day, even the old crown jewels of News International? </p> <p>It is Rupert's own version of devolution, but it also fragments the empire and makes the job of the next generation more complex still. The days when he could demand the detail of everything he owned, barking down the telephone, have faded. Cultural imperialism is one thing, World Citizen Kanery rather another. Though he still gabs away rather too freely for the liking of his lieutenants - see his latest observation that Tony Blair is 'deluded' about Europe - the new Murdoch needs, of necessity, to be less seen and less heard. Perceptually, he can be defined as the problem and not the opportunity. </p> <p>These are very deep waters. He has able lieutenants. He has usually been a good picker of managerial talent (as well as of editors). He has firm alliances with cable movers and shakers like John Malone. But transitions - as King Lear discovered - are the very devil; and voluntarily relinquishing old ways of control don't get easier in the eighth decade. </p> <p>He is, make no mistake, a family man. He wants the warmth of his family, his children and their partners, around him. Sons-in-law get a job on the payroll. Nobody at News Corp doubts where power, once passed, will remain. The breakdown of his marriage to Anna and remarriage to Wendi Deng were not done easily or with a light heart. The owner of the News of the World is, perversely, a moral conservative: one contradiction among hundreds. But where there are families, there is also rich scope for feuding and fallings out. Step mothers the same age as the kids do not naturally fit; too much ambition piled upon a single, balding head carries its own crushing weight. </p> <p>That is why, just for once, it is necessary to set Rupert Murdoch in the time capsule of his seventieth anniversary. Forget work in progress, because work is always in progress. Concentrate on what he has done. </p> <p>It is a mixed ledger, to be sure. Those who want hanging cases have all the ammunition they could wish for. But it is also a story of brute resolve and drive, and courage at a crunch. Ask not where we have come with him, but where we would have been without him. Goodbye Robert Maxwell: you were utterly out-matched. </p> <p>Goodbye, less obviously, Conrad Black: you are a (Canadian) seller of titles and a buyer no more; you are out of the race. </p> <p>The difficulty, I think, is that if Rupert Murdoch had not existed, it would have been necessary to invent him. And the sins we visit on him - of cynicism, calculation, manipulation - are often no more than a reflection of our own weaknesses. When Tony Blair kow-tows, he tells us about New Labour, not Murdoch. When the rival press mounts its ritual attacks, the question is not what he has got away with, but what we let him get away with. </p> <p>So happy birthday to the lion as winter nears.

      "bodyText": "Three score years and ten. It has become the late autumn of life, the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness when judges take their port and ex-ministers doze on the Lords' red benches. It is, in turn, a time that invites mellower verdicts on lives of toil. And Keith Rupert Murdoch is 70 this week. I never thought to write this piece through his first 69 years. He was, in so many ways, the enemy: Rupert the Barbarian, laying waste established orders, debasing the currency of journalism, bending politicians to his right-wing agenda, marching ever on towards international domination. But there he sits now, in a New York apartment or Bel Air mansion, tended by a fierce young wife, and the balance has changed. We are nearer, far nearer, to the end of empire. We can see him whole. He does not travel as much as he did. He is frailer, feeling the first pangs of mortality. His mind is much on the division of spoils among his family; the crown for Lachlan, the consolation prizes for James and Elisabeth. Meanwhile, the world he would rule has changed around him and his aura of infallibility has gone. He got the internet revolution wrong not once but twice; too late into the game, too slow to see that the tide had ebbed. He must fight to survive against new foes he barely saw coming like AOL-Time Warner and Disney and Seagram. The predatory French of Vivendi snap at his heels. This jungle is suddenly full of big beasts. That does not mean he has stopped. To the contrary, a deal to create a truly global satellite business - and a company worth $70 billion - hovers between glorious conclusion and ignominious collapse. He has staked out a unique position in the wars of digital supremacy, and he may well be right. But one other thing is also clear. These are the coming thirty-year wars, perhaps even 100-year wars. He will not be around to hail victory. He leaves that to future generations - and maybe, as he looks around at other media dynasties, he shivers a little. Whatever became of the Los Angeles Times Chandlers or Roy Thomson's newspaper legacy? Sold off because the heirs and successors weren't interested. The hereditary principle is only as good as heredity's next spin of the wheel. Does he feel lucky? So, at 70, you can ask a different question. What would our world have been like without Rupert Murdoch? What if he had never been born or had carved out some modest Australian, beer-swilling career amid the debris of his own father's newspaper holdings? A kinder, gentler place shot sweetly through with liberal values? Perhaps: but don't bank on it. The Sun he bought long ago from Hugh Cudlipp was a misbegotten creation heading straight for the abattoir. He saved it, changed it and built it. The News of the World always came seedy side up, prurience with your Sunday roast. And what would have happened if Ken Thomson had hung on to the Times and Sunday Times ? Nothing good. Young Ken had no relish for printers' ink. They would have been cut adrift anyway - and who can tell what would have become of them? I was there with a Guardian bid, talking to Harry Evans, and I still feel sore. But I also note that the people who want to buy national papers today are called Hinduja or Richard Desmond. There's no queue of saints with open chequebooks waiting at the door. Murdoch is a newspaperman, which is something for other newspapermen to remember and value. He knows about readers and what, for good or ill, they want. (If there had been no Sun, then millions of its readers would not have read anything.) He is no bean counter. He supports and attempts to resuscitate loss-making papers instinctively; not just the Times, but the New York Post. He fights almost to the death rather than succumb. He gambles relentlessly on his own judgment. These are not minor virtues, and they belong to the world that surrounds us rather than the world we might wish to invent.

      "bodyText": "Living next to high voltage power cables may lead to an enhanced risk of cancer for children, according to new Government research to be made public next week. A team of experts commissioned by the National Radiological Protection Board (BNRPB) - the government's radiation watchdog - will also state that there may be a link to adult cancers. The team has been led by Sir Richard Doll, the veteran epidemiologist who discovered that smoking caused lung cancer more than 30 years ago. He is expected to recommend further research. There have been a number of studies of possible links between cancer in children and proximity to high voltage cables. This is the first official investigation to find a connection. The researchers have said that they are not sure how it works, but it is possible that the power lines emit charged particles which react with oxygen and nitrogen in the air, making it easier for pollutants in the air to enter the body's cells. Professor Colin Blakemore, a member of Doll's team, said the risk was 'slightly elevated.' The Electricity Association, which represents many of Britain's power generators and distributors, said they were taking the new findings seriously though there was no concrete evidence that power lines caused cancer. As long ago as 1979, American studies showed high levels of leukemia in children living close to overhead power lines. The new research may prompt thousands of compensation claims against the government. Doll refused to comment. No one from the BNRPB was available last night.",

Political thrillers have seldom had it so good - and it is instructive, as the Baftas and Blair cuddle ever closer to America, to wonder why. After all, even the National Lottery would not put up money to make a British movie about Downing Street.

Two more big budget essays in White House power-broking arrive this month. One - Rod Lurie's The Contender - is a vicious struggle for power. The other - Roger Donaldson's Thirteen Days - is the story of John Kennedy's struggle to hang on to it through the Cuban missile crisis. Both invite our attention; indeed, almost command it. Whatever happened to the Falklands (with Maggie Smith) - or the filleting of Mandy (with Vinnie Jones as Alastair Campbell)? </p> <p>It is a case, on examination, of a genre which has lived over decades and a defunct non-genre that died with Trollope. Britain has rarely, if ever, thought politics worth putting on screen. Churchill may occasionally be impersonated in war epics, but otherwise Prime Ministers are unsung. </p> <p>Transient bores. America has never believed that for a second. It sees its leaders as heroes or villains. It expects greatness (or, at least, great entertainment). It wants to watch President Harrison Ford pitted against the forces of evil in Air Force One, just as it wanted to watch President Fredric March do his stuff four decades ago through Seven Days in May. It likes good Presidents played by Henry Fonda (The Best Man) and malignant Presidents played by Gene Hackman (Absolute Power). It is a nation obsessed by its own history which scents dollars in the recreation. </p> <p>Over time, of course, the genre has developed its own standard themes and sub-divisions. By those lights, The Contender is bog-standard fare. Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is plucked from the back shelf when President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) decides he wants a woman one heartbeat from the Oval Office. Joan is intelligent and thoughtful and ought to have voted for Ralph Nader last year; her confirmation hearings' adversary, Senator Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) is a warped, conniving creep - and, naturally, a Republican. The light and the darkness lock predictable horns. Manslaughter and mayhem follow. </p> <p>What makes The Contender a rip-roaring ride, though, is not the bones of a plot that writes itself but the scope politics has to refresh it. This, perhaps the last offering of the late-Clinton period, lets President Jeff gorge himself on junk sharkfish sandwiches and play cocky, cornball bruiser. 'A girl died and you let it happen...' he tells one cowering candidate. 'You're the future of the Democratic Party, and always will be.' Sex can be talked about crudely - 'The one thing the American people can't stomach is a Vice-President with a mouthful of cock' - and even shown between consenting adults. We first meet Senator Joan flat on her desk being pleasured by a man who turns out to be her husband. </p> <p>Should she pay the price for the student orgies of long ago? 'If I were a man, nobody would care how many sexual partners I had in college - and if it's not relevant for man, it's not relevant for a woman.' Should she answer back, as Bill Clinton tried to do, or suffer in saintly silence? A contemporary gloss of headline issues and pundit dilemmas can be applied like a new coat of paint. This, in essence, is the Fonda of The Best Man or the Redford of The Candidate reworked for modern times and modern manners. Everybody involved read Primary Colors, everybody sniggered at Wag the Dog. Thirteen Days sits handily at the other end of the genre spectrum. This is not a teasing collation of historic parallels, but a stab at recreating history - from White House tapes and Robert Kennedy's book about the crisis that seemed, for almost a fortnight, to signal the end of our world. It purports, as did Oliver Stone's Nixon, to be a version of the truth, and it belongs to the quasi-documentary tradition which All the President's Men began. </p> <p>Bruce Greenwood plays JFK in the same way that Anthony Hopkins played Nixon: that is not as Travolta-style parody Clinton, but as a distinct, created character who convinces because he has a life of his own. He does not look much like Kennedy, but he exists and dithers and finds resolve in a White House which has the sniff of reality to it. You feel, at the close, that you have been there with him, through 13 days of hell. </p> <p>Does that have any resonance for a cinema audience which, in the broad, was not thought of, let alone born, in 1962? Who, sitting in the stalls in Swindon, cares about very dead Presidents and wars that did not happen in confrontations with a Moscow which has ceased to exist? The trick - the developing trick for Stone as well as Roger Donaldson - is to add a little universality, which means layers of complexity. Greenwood's fight is not merely with an unseen Khrushchev but against his own gung-ho chiefs of staff and administration cold warriors. Look what his dad did at Munich, says Dean Acheson, 'Let's hope appeasement doesn't run in the family.' Hear the ancestral voices of George Bush's Pentagon. </p> <p>Yet - and Stone's Nixon shows it most starkly - the universality is about more than the manoeuvres of governance: it depends on borrowing the classical structures of tragedy. Hopkins's Nixon is not Hannibal in a Sixties suit, rather a genuinely tragic figure. They Larkined him up, his saintly mum and dad. He carries his dirt-poor upbringing like a cross, bitterly resenting Kennedy's silver spoon. 'All my life he's been sticking it to me: now he steals it [the election] from me.' Those who see hints of Macbeth (Act Five) in his final fall are dead right. Exeunt omnes to the sepulchral verdict of Paul Sorvino's Kissinger. 'Can you imagine what the man might have been had he ever been loved?' </p> <p>These parallels are not accidental. I was in the Smithsonian in Washington a few weeks ago, wandering round a new exhibition on the presidency which features a whole room of posters and clips about its TV and movie incarnations (from Polly Bergen's Kisses for my President up). That was interesting enough, but the way it melded with the whole (very packed) exhibition was more interesting still. </p> <p>These Presidents, from Lincoln to Jimmy Carter, were heroes presented as heroes. They were kings and gods, their mementoes - Warren Harding's silk pyjamas - stored in glass caskets as though they were Buddha's ashes. The films about them, accordingly, have a very simple question to answer: What were they like? What is it like to be near them? </p> <p>You may look for your answers at the pages of the National Enquirer, or in a collected Shakespeare, or yet further back. Some of these films are, in a sense, the old biblical epics Hollywood used to make refettled for a more cynical age. 'Here's the darkness reaching out for the dark. Open that scab and you uncover a lot of pus,' says Nixon of his Judas, Howard Hunt. No wonder the Britpack has steered well clear. We treat our leaders with fawning deference - where's Harold Macmillan in the Profumo movie Scandal ? - but build no legends around them. Ted Heath does not retire this year to a marbled memorial library; Jim Callaghan is down on the farm thinking foot and mouth; Mrs T, unchronicled, is out there somewhere, sounding off as usual.

      "body": "<p>In my review of Jocelyn Moorhouse's Proof, the film in which Russell Crowe first made a strong impression a decade ago, I noted that the chief quality of the character he played (a tough odd-job man who befriends a bitter, well-off blind orphan) was a 'guileless honesty'. Crowe, one of the most engaging stars in today's cinema, has been playing variations on this role ever since, most notably in LA Confidential, The Insider, Gladiator and now Taylor Hackford's Proof of Life, a semi-documentary thriller written by Tony Gilroy and inspired by an article in Vanity Fair magazine. </p> <p>Crowe has the open face of James Stewart and Gary Cooper, and he moves with the ambling swagger of Warner Brothers tough guys like Bogart, Robinson, Cagney and Garfield. But in Proof of Life, for the first time outside his native Antipodes (he was born in New Zealand, raised in Australia) he uses his own accent. He's Terry Thorne, an ex-SAS man working in the K and R (kidnapping and ransom) business for a City of London insurance firm. The opening credit sequence, an economical little film in itself, shows him reporting to his suave, immaculately suited bosses on a successful operation that involved freeing a Frenchman from Chechen rebels while holding off double-crossing Russian soldiers. This episode establishes Thorne as a man of probity with the diplomatic gifts of Henry Kissinger and the military skills of a hi-tech Orde Wingate. </p> <p>Meanwhile, down in the fictitious Latin American state of Tecala, the United States government is supporting a right-wing regime that is seeking to promote US oil interests and suppress a ragged band of ex-Marxist guerrillas who deal in cocaine and ransom money. Caught in the crossfire is an idealistic engineer, Peter Bowman (David Morse), who thinks he's building a dam to help the local population though in his heart he knows it's a gift to Tecala's corrupt politicians by an oil conglomerate to obtain rights to build a pipeline. </p> <p>Bowman's marriage to Alice (Meg Ryan) is fraying after years of dispiriting work in the Third World, and at this difficult point he's kidnapped by the terrorists and taken into the mountains. The US embassy refuses help on bogus diplomatic grounds, the local police and army are not to be trusted, and Thorne is dispatched from London to take over the case and bring hope to Alice. </p> <p>It turns out, however, that Bowman's company has just been taken over, that their hostage insurance has lapsed, and the new owners don't want to get involved in freeing him. So Thorne's services are withdrawn and he returns to Europe. In case we miss the point about the utter venality of this political-commercial nexus, Hackford has cast as Bowman's local American boss the most deviously dislikeable character actor since Murray Hamilton (the mayor in Jaws) retired. He's Anthony Heald, best-known as the vindictive shrink who torments Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs and a man who oozes insincerity from every pore. </p> <p>For 40 years, films about Americans in Latin America like State of Siege, Missing, Under Fire and Salvador, have shown up Washington and the local politicians in an equally bad light. Proof of Life is no exception. Fortunately Thorne has a change of heart. He bids farewell to his young son at a smart English boarding school (Gilroy and Hackford must have had some lingering memory of an identical scene in the 1978 film The Wild Geese when mercenary Richard Harris goes off on a similar mission) and returns to help Alice in Tecala. There's an explosive scene in which he, his American mercenary sidekick (David Caruso) and their team turn the tables on Alice's devious Latin assistants and restore her confidence.

      "bodyText": "In my review of Jocelyn Moorhouse's Proof, the film in which Russell Crowe first made a strong impression a decade ago, I noted that the chief quality of the character he played (a tough odd-job man who befriends a bitter, well-off blind orphan) was a 'guileless honesty'. Crowe, one of the most engaging stars in today's cinema, has been playing variations on this role ever since, most notably in LA Confidential, The Insider, Gladiator and now Taylor Hackford's Proof of Life, a semi-documentary thriller written by Tony Gilroy and inspired by an article in Vanity Fair magazine. Crowe has the open face of James Stewart and Gary Cooper, and he moves with the ambling swagger of Warner Brothers tough guys like Bogart, Robinson, Cagney and Garfield. But in Proof of Life, for the first time outside his native Antipodes (he was born in New Zealand, raised in Australia) he uses his own accent. He's Terry Thorne, an ex-SAS man working in the K and R (kidnapping and ransom) business for a City of London insurance firm. The opening credit sequence, an economical little film in itself, shows him reporting to his suave, immaculately suited bosses on a successful operation that involved freeing a Frenchman from Chechen rebels while holding off double-crossing Russian soldiers. This episode establishes Thorne as a man of probity with the diplomatic gifts of Henry Kissinger and the military skills of a hi-tech Orde Wingate. Meanwhile, down in the fictitious Latin American state of Tecala, the United States government is supporting a right-wing regime that is seeking to promote US oil interests and suppress a ragged band of ex-Marxist guerrillas who deal in cocaine and ransom money. Caught in the crossfire is an idealistic engineer, Peter Bowman (David Morse), who thinks he's building a dam to help the local population though in his heart he knows it's a gift to Tecala's corrupt politicians by an oil conglomerate to obtain rights to build a pipeline. Bowman's marriage to Alice (Meg Ryan) is fraying after years of dispiriting work in the Third World, and at this difficult point he's kidnapped by the terrorists and taken into the mountains. The US embassy refuses help on bogus diplomatic grounds, the local police and army are not to be trusted, and Thorne is dispatched from London to take over the case and bring hope to Alice. It turns out, however, that Bowman's company has just been taken over, that their hostage insurance has lapsed, and the new owners don't want to get involved in freeing him. So Thorne's services are withdrawn and he returns to Europe. In case we miss the point about the utter venality of this political-commercial nexus, Hackford has cast as Bowman's local American boss the most deviously dislikeable character actor since Murray Hamilton (the mayor in Jaws) retired. He's Anthony Heald, best-known as the vindictive shrink who torments Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs and a man who oozes insincerity from every pore. For 40 years, films about Americans in Latin America like State of Siege, Missing, Under Fire and Salvador, have shown up Washington and the local politicians in an equally bad light. Proof of Life is no exception. Fortunately Thorne has a change of heart. He bids farewell to his young son at a smart English boarding school (Gilroy and Hackford must have had some lingering memory of an identical scene in the 1978 film The Wild Geese when mercenary Richard Harris goes off on a similar mission) and returns to help Alice in Tecala. There's an explosive scene in which he, his American mercenary sidekick (David Caruso) and their team turn the tables on Alice's devious Latin assistants and restore her confidence. He then takes over the operation and a fascinating cat-and-mouse game on mobile phones and shortwave radio gets under way between the guerrillas' representative and Thorne - first to establish 'proof of life', then to bargain over the ransom money. As this slow, delicate business proceeds, Bowman is being dragged from camp to camp, physical condition deteriorating, morale fluctuating, hopes encouraged by meeting a captive missionary (Gottfried John). He's also sustained by a photograph of Alice, and we fear that the inevitable intimacy springing up from her dependence on Thorne might turn into something more serious. There are announcements from time to time of which day of captivity we're watching, and wisely Hackford does not rush a film that takes place over four months, relying on his actors and on the continuing suspense to hold our interest. But he does introduce a melodramatic coincidence that more work on the plot could have averted, and at the end he switches into a slap-up action mode of a conventional, though exciting kind, in the manner of pictures like Uncommon Valor about mercenaries freeing PoWs in South-East Asia. These films of liberation come from the captivity stories of the American West as mediated by John Ford's influential The Searchers.

      "body": "<p>I was four years old when my father came back to kidnap me. It was Sunday night, Ed Sullivan night, the TV was blasting, and I was making so much noise that we didn't hear his truck drive up. This is how my sisters tell it. Mom was next door playing calookie, Joyce was sacked out on the couch, Marcia was cross-legged on the floor, bouncing Belle in her lap. 'A really big shoe !' I was screaming at Ed's ugly mortician's face, swinging my body back and forth like a two-by-four with the arms nailed on. </p> <p>When he gunned the motor I ran to the window, and seconds later the room was in chaos. My father, who had disappeared a few weeks earlier, kicked in the door and grabbed me. 'We're getting out of here,' he said, hoisting me up like I weighed nothing. I was naked to the waist and barefoot, and as we moved to the car, I felt both thrilled and terrified. Then I heard my mother screaming behind us like a cat getting skinned. 'Put him down, you son of a bitch!' she yelled, yanking me halfway out of his arms. He squeezed my wrists, she held my ankles, and they stood there pulling me apart. 'Let us go!' I pleaded with her, but she kicked him in the groin instead, dragged me to the house, and locked the door. </p> <p>I ran to the window and pounded my fists. My father was doubled over by the headlights, clutching himself and rocking. Then he straightened up, slid behind the wheel and gunned the motor. He honked the horn once, then inched back out of the driveway. The headlights bounced when the truck hit the street, then disappeared slowly down the block. </p> <p>I never saw or heard from my father again. </p> <p>Thirty-two years later, I was sitting in a restaurant telling this story to a friend as I'd told it a hundred times before. He asked me what people always ask: why had I never looked for my father? </p> <p>'He was a worthless bastard,' I said. 'I was lucky that he left.' That had been the family line, pounded into my head growing up, backed up by a list of his vices: alcohol, stealing, chasing women, lying pathologically. Besides all that, my mother was sure that I wasn't the kind of son he had wanted. I was 'sensitive,' 'artistic,' not a grease-monkey jock-type like him. She convinced me that our relationship would have been a disaster. Finally, I said to my friend, I have no interest in knowing someone who didn't want to know me. If my father gave a damn what became of me after that night in '61, he could look me up in the telephone book. I was listed. </p> <p>This line always sounded convincing before, but this time it rang hollow. I could hear my own psychological scam, smell the cover-up I'd helped construct. 'We tell ourselves stories in order to live,' Joan Didion wrote years ago, and suddenly I asked myself if I hadn't done the same thing as a way of surviving abandonment. Why had I never looked for my father, really? Why hadn't I so much as thought of seeking him out on the many occasions a father is called for - bar mitzvah, graduations, funerals, career moves? Who might I have been if this man whom everyone hated was in my life today? As far back as I could remember, I had the feeling that half of me was covered in shadow, not quite real, a partial phantom. Had this darkness been cast, I wondered, by my father's absence? Could his disappearance at age 37 - the exact age I was as I sat there - be the handicap that had haunted me for so long? Was this, in fact, the reason why (in deep and troubling ways) I could not assume my own authority, balance my chequebook, sign a lease, commit to a lover, become a man? </p> <p> These are the questions that prompted me seven years ago to find my father - a 69-year-old machinist and army vet named James J Matousek - dead or alive. </p> <p>I met the detective, Mack Sullivan, in his office overlooking Broadway. Snowy-haired and baby-faced, Sullivan was, I'd been told, one of the best in the business. He asked me to describe in minute detail everything I knew about my father, and seemed amazed by how little that was. I had no photograph of us together, no knowledge of paternal grandparents, no birth date, no correspondence - nothing but genes and a surname to prove that Jim Matousek ever existed. Sullivan listened and took notes, and the more I told him, the redder his face became. 'I'm gonna nail this guy,' he said angrily. </p> <p>'I hope so,' I said. </p> <p>'In the meantime, squeeze what you can out of your mother.' </p> <p>'I've tried.' </p> <p>'Squeeze again.' </p> <p>The detective didn't know what he was asking. My mother, Ida, is the ostrich type - no see, no hear, no en casa . Though my baby sister Belle - who was less than a year old when Jim disappeared - was thrilled at the prospect of meeting the father she never knew, Ida was adamantly against it. She told me flat out that he was dead. </p> <p>'How can you be sure?' I asked her on the phone. </p> <p>'I'm sure, Mark. Leave it alone.' </p> <p>I told her I was doing this mostly out of curiosity - I used to be a reporter by trade - and had nearly convinced even myself that I wasn't emotionally invested in the outcome. To calm Ida down, I told her that I simply wanted to resolve this mystery, as if it were someone else's father, and close this parenthesis once and for all. She could not seem to comprehend this. As far as my mother was concerned, it was good riddance to bad rubbish - rubbish she had long ago swept into oblivion. Pressed with questions of who my father was, she responded like an amnesiac, her memory riddled with dead spots and holes. </p> <p>When were you married? 'Who can remember?' </p> <p>Where was the wedding? 'It was a long time ago.' </p> <p>What were his parents' names? 'Never met them.' </p> <p>Brothers and sisters? 'If you don't stop!' </p> <p>In fact, my mother recalled nothing but the colour of my father's eyes ('grey like a wolf's'), his peptic ulcers and his habit of making paycheques disappear before she could get her hands on them. </p> <p>'Why don't you really want me to find him?' I asked her, tired of dancing around the truth. </p> <p>'You couldn't take it,' she said. </p> <p>'Maybe I could.' </p> <p>'Well, maybe I couldn't.' </p> <p>So that's it, I think, the real bottom line. In spite of herself, she finally agreed to cooperate with the search by getting me a copy of their marriage certificate from the Hall of Records. When it arrived a few weeks later, I saw my father's signature for the first time -graceful, almost feminine, not nearly as rough as I would have expected - and my grandmother's maiden name, Busch. </p> <p> My parents were the first couple on the block to get a divorce. JFK was still president and I was the only boy in the neighbourhood without a dad, someone to show me how to play ball, how to fix stuff, how to think of girls as other than sisters. What was a man supposed to feel like? This was the fathomless mystery. When it came to the workings of a man's heart, the instinct he'd have for finding the door and knowing how to enter the world, I was completely stumped. Without this model of masculinity, boyhood's normal confusion about sex was exaggerated for me into a sort of identity crisis. The bathroom was my laboratory, the mirror a sort of microscope for scrutinising this person I was. I used my mother's make-up kit to discover at what point I stopped being me - whoever that was - and started being someone else. Sometimes I was Genghis Khan, scowling and uni-browed, other times I turbaned my head and puckered my lips like Marilyn Monroe. Without a man within intimate range, a trunk to branch off from, a model to copy, I felt like neither boy nor girl; in fact, I felt like only half a child, as if the other part of me had stuck to my father's hands that night and disappeared with him in his car. </p> <p>Lists and memos began to flood in from Mack Sullivan's office. There were documents from banks and government agencies, the Social Security Department. I was surprised by how many James Matouseks there are in the world, and how each one had some disqualifying characteristic: too young, too short, too old, too rich. Attached to the lists were cryptic notes from Sullivan, some of them so film noir they made me laugh. 'We will reach him on a ruse,' said one, regarding a Jim in California. Or: 'On 9 April, Investigator DB proceeded to the New York Public Library Annex for old phone books.' I imagined one of Sullivan's assistants slithering down Fifth Avenue in a trenchcoat, white pages strapped against his body. It all seemed very camp. </p> <p>Two envelopes arrived in the post from agencies I contacted before hiring Sullivan. One, for $17.95, provided the names of seven living people with my father's name, the other with 10 who were deceased. Fortunately, none of the dead Jims had my father's middle initial. Three of the living did, however, and without telling Sullivan, I decided to call them on my own. </p> <p>I dialled the one in Iowa first. An old man answered. I explained my situation and asked - feeling absolutely ridiculous - if there was any chance that he could be my father. </p> <p>'I wish I could say I was,' said the old guy. </p> <p>'Are you sure?' I asked, surprised by the disappointment in my voice. 'I don't want anything from you - him - except to talk.' </p> <p>'I wish I could help you, but I've never lived outside of this town and never had kids. Wanna ask my wife? Milly!' he shouted before I could stop him. </p> <p>'Hello?' said an old lady. </p> <p>I was so embarrassed that I hung up. </p> <p>I called the other two Jims and got similar results - ironclad alibis and pitying voices I was not prepared for. One of them asked me if I had any friends I could talk to. For the first time, I felt like an orphan. I wondered if I was doing the right thing, whether I should leave well enough alone. I considered calling the whole thing off. </p> <p> I told my family the details when I visited them a few weeks later in California. I was amazed to find that my search had jarred their memories. Suddenly, my aunt, my sister, even my mother started revealing details about my father that I'd never known. </p> <p>'Remember the first time Jim came back to get you?' my older sister Joyce asked. </p> <p>'The first time?' I nearly choked, glaring at my mother fiddling intently with her cigarette. </p> <p>'He locked you in a motel room and threatened not to let you out if Mommy didn't give in.' Ida rolled her eyes. 'Or the time he threw you in the crib and practically broke your neck?' </p> <p>'You know what I remember?' said Aunt Ruth. 'He had a cleft in his chin like Kirk Douglas.' </p> <p>'Handsome,' my mother chimed in. 'A real ladies' man.' For the first time in my life, I heard unsarcastic affection in her voice for somebody she claimed to loathe. </p> <p>'Tell me the truth, Mom,' I said. 'Didn't you ever love him?' </p> <p>She stared past me through the patio screen. 'Maybe, once upon a time.' She put out her smoke and lit another. 'He sure was one hell of a lover,' she said. </p> <p>'Sex isn't love,' her prudish sister Ruth added quickly. </p> <p>'I'll put it to you this way,' said Ida, the former bad girl who ran away from her Orthodox Jewish house to cruise with the hoodlums. 'I'd never seen that much man before in my entire life.' </p> <p>Later, in bed, replaying her words, the only recollection of being alone with my father floated up into memory. We were in the shower, it was morning, and my face barely reached the top of his leg. I remembered vividly how his body looked, the strange hairy parts of him, his penis covered with soap, the distant realisation that I would look like him some day. It was just my father and I, together in this hidden place. He squirted shampoo in my hair and scrubbed my scalp hard, then pulled my face into his thigh and tickled me where I hated it, under the arms, till I fell on the floor and begged him to stop. 'Please, please!' I screamed, half-tormented, half-ecstatic. He snorted like a bull and wouldn't let up. </p> <p>Then my mother was pounding on the door, yelling for us to get out. 'Don't listen to her,' my father said, turning off the water, wrapping me in a thick white towel. I sat on the toilet and watched him while he shaved. Talking to me, not paying attention, he caught the razor in the cleft of his chin and put a plaster over the blood. </p> <p>Back home, I reported all this to Sullivan - excluding the shower scene. 'I told you they needed to be goosed,' he said. </p> <p>He continued his paper chase with the tenacity of a pit bull. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, no death benefits had been paid on anyone with my father's name. This meant that unless he was living under an alias or foregoing his Social Security benefits, he wasn't dead. </p> <p>When I grew impatient with this slow process, Sullivan suggested another tack. Apparently, Health and Human Services has a policy of helping family members track down missing relatives in emergency situations. For this to happen, I needed to write an open letter to my father which they would forward to anyone with his name. Sullivan suggested that I include a photograph of myself with the letter. I spent a day deciding what image I wanted my father to see - with hair or without - and decided finally on the balding truth. I felt a stab of ridiculous, vain regret that he hadn't know me in my halcyon days - as if he would've loved a curly-haired son more than one with a wispy monk's tonsure. </p> <p>I wrote an awkward open letter (knowing it would be read by strangers), explaining that I had contracted a 'possibly fatal virus', and ending with a polite request for my father to 'contact me immediately', with no strings attached. I assured him that my mother did not need to know about our meeting. Then I sealed the envelope and sent it off to some bureaucrat in Washington DC. </p> <p>Nothing happened. Two weeks passed, then four, then six. The excitement of the chase began to wane; intrigue was replaced by cynicism, then by impending defeat. My sister Belle was more disappointed than I was and wept on the telephone. </p> <p>'He's never gonna see my kids,' she said, 'or even know what I look like.' Belle had become my reality check, my reminder of what was really at stake here, which my writer's distance could nearly blur out. </p> <p>'It's not over yet,' I told her, barely hiding my own doubt. 'Sullivan's good. If our father's out there, he'll find him.' </p> <p>'Do you even care?' Belle asked, sounding like I was a heartless wretch. </p> <p>'I'm not really sure.' </p> <p> In the middle of May, Sullivan called to say he was on to something. A James J Matousek with an Illinois Social Security number had turned up somewhere in California. When I pressed the detective for details, he was cagey about the suspect's exact whereabouts, and said he wanted to do 'recon naissance' before we went any further. Also, there seemed to be a hitch: the files of this guy's current account had been purged. </p> <p>'Purged?' I asked. 'What does that mean?' </p> <p>'Beats the hell out of me.' </p> <p>It turned out that this particular suspect was last seen in Pasadena, a few minutes' drive from where my father had originally left us. In the weeks that followed, Sullivan learned that no obituary for James J Matousek had been published i n that vicinity. He charmed a librarian into researching the Mountain View Cemetery, Pasadena's most popular burial ground, but she could not find a grave. For the first time since the search began, Sullivan seemed flummoxed. 'All roads end in 1989,' he wrote to me in a memo. 'Not sure what this means, but I will continue to trace him.' </p> <p>Shortly afterward, I left the city to spend the summer in Santa Fe, determined not to put my life on hold for what may end up being a wild-goose chase. I settled into a house with a view of the Sangre de Cristo mountains to work on a book, and do my best to put my father, Sullivan and the memos behind me. Thirty-two years without my father had hardened me against hope. And now, with a change of location, the prospects of finding him turned even more spectral, like the cow skull hanging above the front door. </p> <p>It was a relief to have half-given up. I felt righteous for having tried and failed. Then one morning, my boyfriend Louis and I came home to a message from Mack Sullivan on the answering machine. 'Call me immediately,' he said. 'We've found him.' </p> <p> From the time I was very small, I was told that I had my father's face. 'Look at him!' my older sisters would marvel. 'The profile, the way he walks. Exactly like Jim.' My mother would shake her head as if to say, 'Don't encourage him', and they'd stop. </p> <p>She didn't realise how much I needed to hear this, how I needed to look like someone other than myself and Belle. Everyone in our house was fat and dark; she and I were blond and skinny, like aliens that blew in through the window and never really belonged. </p> <p>Then one day while I was still in New York, my aunt Ruth called up. 'I found him!' she exclaimed. 'The movie, I mean.' </p> <p>'What movie?' I asked. </p> <p>'Just come out and see for yourself.' </p> <p>I wangled a press trip to California, and immediately drove to Aunt Ruth's house. She put a reel on the projector, and a shaky home movie flickered on to the screen. The camera followed my mother while she rushed around in capris and a tie-up blouse, serving burgers and beers to people at a party. Then the lens zoomed in on a wavy-haired man with an angular face, T-shirt sleeves rolled up around his biceps. The man turned to the camera, smiled, and I saw, with a shock, my own face mirrored back at me. </p> <p>'My God!' I said out loud, staring into my father's eyes, seeing where I'd come from for the first time in my adult life. I sat there studying my father's face, the receding hairline like mine, the sunken cheeks, long nose, deep-set melancholy eyes, hardly able to believe the chilling resemblance. It filled me with a tirade of feelings - vindication, excitement, sadness, redemption, confusion, loneliness, rage. I sat there staring a long time, memorising his face again, letting the fact of my father sink in. </p> <p>'We told you, honey,' said Aunt Ruth. 'Remember?' </p> <p> I called Sullivan back. 'If this isn't him, I'll turn in my licence,' he told me. </p> <p>I said nothing. </p> <p>'You OK?' he asked. </p> <p>'I'm not sure.' </p> <p>'Scared?' </p> <p>'Uh huh.' </p> <p>'Who wouldn't be?' </p> <p>The detective told me what he knew. Apparently, Sullivan tracked down this suspect through his neighbours, who provided the unlisted phone number. Sullivan himself called 'on a ruse' and heard two names on the answering machine. 'He lives with another man,' he says. 'A foreigner.' </p> <p>'Now what?' I asked. </p> <p>'You call him.' </p> <p>Suddenly, I felt cornered. 'What do I say?' </p> <p>'Tell him you're his long-lost son. Tell him you're his pride and joy. Tell him that he ruined your life.' </p> <p>'What?' </p> <p>'Just kidding,' he said. 'Here's the number. Call me after you make contact.' </p> <p>I couldn't do it. For 24 hours, the scrap of paper with the Pasadena phone number sat by the phone accusingly. Every time I thought about calling, I got into a panic. What had begun somewhat casually had become a little too real for comfort. With the imminent prospect of actually speaking to my father, I realised how completely unprepared I was for this to happen. </p> <p>Together, Louis and I ran through all the how-will-you-feel-if's that we could conjure. I prepared myself for every form of rejection, disappointment, disillusionment, insult and seduction I could imagine. Finally, I hit on the weirdest possibility of all. </p> <p>'He lives with another man!' I said. </p> <p>'No,' said Louis, getting my drift. </p> <p>'You never know. Two men in their seventies playing house. In Pasadena.' </p> <p>'You're crazy.' </p> <p>Still, the more I thought of it, the more sense this theory began to make. Details started to tie together: my father's handwriting, my mother's innuendoes, his sudden departure, his macho cover-up. Could it be that my father had left because he had no other choice, and how would that change my view of what he'd done? I fantasised about our reunion, pictured us introducing our mates, summer trips to Ischia, marches arm in arm with ACT UP. </p> <p>Gently, Louis tried bursting my bubble. 'A lot of older men live together for companionship,' he said. </p> <p>'Not my dad,' I answered, the word sounding strange in my mouth. 'Should I call him Dad? Or Pop? Or Father?' </p> <p>'Just call him!' </p> <p>Louis made me promise to phone Pasadena Jim the next morning, no matter what. That night I could hardly sleep. Every time I got up to pee, I saw the number staring at me in the dark, like a miracle, right in my face. </p> <p> In the past 20 years, I have interviewed rock stars, movie stars, millionaires, Nobel Prize winners, rapists and people on their deathbeds. I have prided myself on nerves of steel when it came to extemporaneous chat, but that morning, dialling Jim Matousek's number, I was - for all practical purposes - four years old again. </p> <p>He wasn't home. I thought I recognised the voice on the machine and hung up without leaving a message. I tried again, then again, then again, chickening out each time. Finally, I left a polite message asking him to call me back, collect. </p> <p>He didn't. As the days passed, I convinced myself that he'd fled the country at the sound of my voice, too mortified to confront me. </p> <p>On 8 August, I left one final, detailed message, telling Pasadena Jim exactly who I was and why I was calling. 'If you don't want to talk to me,' I said, unable to hide the hurt in my voice, 'then have someone else call me back and say so, immediately. Please.' </p> <p>He called the next afternoon. When I heard his name, I held my breath. 'Dad?' I said. 'Is that you?' </p> <p>'Mark?' </p> <p>'Yes?' </p> <p>'I'm not your dad.' </p> <p>I looked out the window at the mountains. For a moment, I couldn't speak. </p> <p>'You've got to be,' I said finally. </p> <p>'I'm not.' </p> <p>'But I have proof.' </p> <p>He chuckled. 'Oh really?' </p> <p>'Really. </p> <p>'I don't think so,' he said, then told me that he'd never been married or had any children. He told me he wished he could help me. I opened my mouth but no words came out. Louis was sitting on the floor, shaking his head, looking dubious. Finally, I apologised for bothering him. </p> <p>'No bother at all,' he assured me. 'Understandable mistake.' </p> <p>'By the way,' I asked, 'what colour are your eyes?' </p> <p>'Hell if I know,' the old man said. 'Blue, I think.' </p> <p>'Not grey?' </p> <p>'I'm colour-blind, son,' he told me. </p> <p>'So am I,' I say. </p> <p>'Isn't that a coincidence?' </p> <p>'Isn't it?' I answered. Then I hung up the phone with a lump in my throat, unsure of what had just happened. </p> <p>It was worse for Belle, when I told her. She doesn't have the consolation of knowing, as I do, that our father wanted her with him. My aunt Ruth said it was better this way. My mother snapped back to her coldness, saying she always knew he was dead. </p> <p>Finally, I called Mack Sullivan, who simply couldn't believe it. 'Impossible,' he repeated several times. 'I was so sure. The chances. The odds. Something just doesn't add up here.' </p> <p>'Sorry, Mack. He's not my father.' </p> <p>'Well, I'll be damned_' Sullivan's voice trailed off. Then he offered to keep trying even though his sources had dried up. I told him not to bother. </p> <p> Mystery is an acquired taste. When you've been weaned on uncertainty, grown up in a forest of question marks, improvised your very self from scraps and lies and innuendo, you acclimatise to unfinished business and the notion of life as a defective puzzle. After my last talk with the detective, two years passed in a hectic blur: I finished my book, my mother succumbed to lung cancer, and my own prognosis improved drastically with the advent of effective treatments.

I can't say for certain but as I struggled to find his street through the deluge, I felt as if something important were coming, and was far more nervous than I had expected.

      "bodyText": "I was four years old when my father came back to kidnap me. It was Sunday night, Ed Sullivan night, the TV was blasting, and I was making so much noise that we didn't hear his truck drive up. This is how my sisters tell it. Mom was next door playing calookie, Joyce was sacked out on the couch, Marcia was cross-legged on the floor, bouncing Belle in her lap. 'A really big shoe !' I was screaming at Ed's ugly mortician's face, swinging my body back and forth like a two-by-four with the arms nailed on. When he gunned the motor I ran to the window, and seconds later the room was in chaos. My father, who had disappeared a few weeks earlier, kicked in the door and grabbed me. 'We're getting out of here,' he said, hoisting me up like I weighed nothing. I was naked to the waist and barefoot, and as we moved to the car, I felt both thrilled and terrified. Then I heard my mother screaming behind us like a cat getting skinned. 'Put him down, you son of a bitch!' she yelled, yanking me halfway out of his arms. He squeezed my wrists, she held my ankles, and they stood there pulling me apart. 'Let us go!' I pleaded with her, but she kicked him in the groin instead, dragged me to the house, and locked the door. I ran to the window and pounded my fists. My father was doubled over by the headlights, clutching himself and rocking. Then he straightened up, slid behind the wheel and gunned the motor. He honked the horn once, then inched back out of the driveway. The headlights bounced when the truck hit the street, then disappeared slowly down the block. I never saw or heard from my father again. Thirty-two years later, I was sitting in a restaurant telling this story to a friend as I'd told it a hundred times before. He asked me what people always ask: why had I never looked for my father? 'He was a worthless bastard,' I said. 'I was lucky that he left.' That had been the family line, pounded into my head growing up, backed up by a list of his vices: alcohol, stealing, chasing women, lying pathologically. Besides all that, my mother was sure that I wasn't the kind of son he had wanted. I was 'sensitive,' 'artistic,' not a grease-monkey jock-type like him. She convinced me that our relationship would have been a disaster. Finally, I said to my friend, I have no interest in knowing someone who didn't want to know me. If my father gave a damn what became of me after that night in '61, he could look me up in the telephone book. I was listed. This line always sounded convincing before, but this time it rang hollow. I could hear my own psychological scam, smell the cover-up I'd helped construct. 'We tell ourselves stories in order to live,' Joan Didion wrote years ago, and suddenly I asked myself if I hadn't done the same thing as a way of surviving abandonment. Why had I never looked for my father, really? Why hadn't I so much as thought of seeking him out on the many occasions a father is called for - bar mitzvah, graduations, funerals, career moves? Who might I have been if this man whom everyone hated was in my life today? As far back as I could remember, I had the feeling that half of me was covered in shadow, not quite real, a partial phantom. Had this darkness been cast, I wondered, by my father's absence? Could his disappearance at age 37 - the exact age I was as I sat there - be the handicap that had haunted me for so long? Was this, in fact, the reason why (in deep and troubling ways) I could not assume my own authority, balance my chequebook, sign a lease, commit to a lover, become a man? These are the questions that prompted me seven years ago to find my father - a 69-year-old machinist and army vet named James J Matousek - dead or alive. I met the detective, Mack Sullivan, in his office overlooking Broadway. Snowy-haired and baby-faced, Sullivan was, I'd been told, one of the best in the business. He asked me to describe in minute detail everything I knew about my father, and seemed amazed by how little that was. I had no photograph of us together, no knowledge of paternal grandparents, no birth date, no correspondence - nothing but genes and a surname to prove that Jim Matousek ever existed. Sullivan listened and took notes, and the more I told him, the redder his face became. 'I'm gonna nail this guy,' he said angrily. 'I hope so,' I said. 'In the meantime, squeeze what you can out of your mother.' 'I've tried.' 'Squeeze again.' The detective didn't know what he was asking. My mother, Ida, is the ostrich type - no see, no hear, no en casa . Though my baby sister Belle - who was less than a year old when Jim disappeared - was thrilled at the prospect of meeting the father she never knew, Ida was adamantly against it. She told me flat out that he was dead. 'How can you be sure?' I asked her on the phone. 'I'm sure, Mark. Leave it alone.' I told her I was doing this mostly out of curiosity - I used to be a reporter by trade - and had nearly convinced even myself that I wasn't emotionally invested in the outcome. To calm Ida down, I told her that I simply wanted to resolve this mystery, as if it were someone else's father, and close this parenthesis once and for all. She could not seem to comprehend this. As far as my mother was concerned, it was good riddance to bad rubbish - rubbish she had long ago swept into oblivion. Pressed with questions of who my father was, she responded like an amnesiac, her memory riddled with dead spots and holes. When were you married? 'Who can remember?' Where was the wedding? 'It was a long time ago.' What were his parents' names? 'Never met them.' Brothers and sisters? 'If you don't stop!' In fact, my mother recalled nothing but the colour of my father's eyes ('grey like a wolf's'), his peptic ulcers and his habit of making paycheques disappear before she could get her hands on them. 'Why don't you really want me to find him?' I asked her, tired of dancing around the truth. 'You couldn't take it,' she said. 'Maybe I could.' 'Well, maybe I couldn't.' So that's it, I think, the real bottom line. In spite of herself, she finally agreed to cooperate with the search by getting me a copy of their marriage certificate from the Hall of Records. When it arrived a few weeks later, I saw my father's signature for the first time -graceful, almost feminine, not nearly as rough as I would have expected - and my grandmother's maiden name, Busch. My parents were the first couple on the block to get a divorce. JFK was still president and I was the only boy in the neighbourhood without a dad, someone to show me how to play ball, how to fix stuff, how to think of girls as other than sisters. What was a man supposed to feel like? This was the fathomless mystery. When it came to the workings of a man's heart, the instinct he'd have for finding the door and knowing how to enter the world, I was completely stumped. Without this model of masculinity, boyhood's normal confusion about sex was exaggerated for me into a sort of identity crisis. The bathroom was my laboratory, the mirror a sort of microscope for scrutinising this person I was. I used my mother's make-up kit to discover at what point I stopped being me - whoever that was - and started being someone else. Sometimes I was Genghis Khan, scowling and uni-browed, other times I turbaned my head and puckered my lips like Marilyn Monroe. Without a man within intimate range, a trunk to branch off from, a model to copy, I felt like neither boy nor girl; in fact, I felt like only half a child, as if the other part of me had stuck to my father's hands that night and disappeared with him in his car. Lists and memos began to flood in from Mack Sullivan's office. There were documents from banks and government agencies, the Social Security Department. I was surprised by how many James Matouseks there are in the world, and how each one had some disqualifying characteristic: too young, too short, too old, too rich. Attached to the lists were cryptic notes from Sullivan, some of them so film noir they made me laugh. 'We will reach him on a ruse,' said one, regarding a Jim in California. Or: 'On 9 April, Investigator DB proceeded to the New York Public Library Annex for old phone books.' I imagined one of Sullivan's assistants slithering down Fifth Avenue in a trenchcoat, white pages strapped against his body. It all seemed very camp. Two envelopes arrived in the post from agencies I contacted before hiring Sullivan. One, for $17.95, provided the names of seven living people with my father's name, the other with 10 who were deceased. Fortunately, none of the dead Jims had my father's middle initial. Three of the living did, however, and without telling Sullivan, I decided to call them on my own. I dialled the one in Iowa first. An old man answered. I explained my situation and asked - feeling absolutely ridiculous - if there was any chance that he could be my father. 'I wish I could say I was,' said the old guy. 'Are you sure?' I asked, surprised by the disappointment in my voice. 'I don't want anything from you - him - except to talk.' 'I wish I could help you, but I've never lived outside of this town and never had kids. Wanna ask my wife? Milly!' he shouted before I could stop him. 'Hello?' said an old lady. I was so embarrassed that I hung up. I called the other two Jims and got similar results - ironclad alibis and pitying voices I was not prepared for. One of them asked me if I had any friends I could talk to. For the first time, I felt like an orphan. I wondered if I was doing the right thing, whether I should leave well enough alone. I considered calling the whole thing off. I told my family the details when I visited them a few weeks later in California. I was amazed to find that my search had jarred their memories. Suddenly, my aunt, my sister, even my mother started revealing details about my father that I'd never known. 'Remember the first time Jim came back to get you?' my older sister Joyce asked. 'The first time?' I nearly choked, glaring at my mother fiddling intently with her cigarette. 'He locked you in a motel room and threatened not to let you out if Mommy didn't give in.' Ida rolled her eyes. 'Or the time he threw you in the crib and practically broke your neck?' 'You know what I remember?' said Aunt Ruth. 'He had a cleft in his chin like Kirk Douglas.' 'Handsome,' my mother chimed in. 'A real ladies' man.' For the first time in my life, I heard unsarcastic affection in her voice for somebody she claimed to loathe. 'Tell me the truth, Mom,' I said. 'Didn't you ever love him?' She stared past me through the patio screen. 'Maybe, once upon a time.' She put out her smoke and lit another. 'He sure was one hell of a lover,' she said. 'Sex isn't love,' her prudish sister Ruth added quickly. 'I'll put it to you this way,' said Ida, the former bad girl who ran away from her Orthodox Jewish house to cruise with the hoodlums. 'I'd never seen that much man before in my entire life.' Later, in bed, replaying her words, the only recollection of being alone with my father floated up into memory. We were in the shower, it was morning, and my face barely reached the top of his leg. I remembered vividly how his body looked, the strange hairy parts of him, his penis covered with soap, the distant realisation that I would look like him some day. It was just my father and I, together in this hidden place. He squirted shampoo in my hair and scrubbed my scalp hard, then pulled my face into his thigh and tickled me where I hated it, under the arms, till I fell on the floor and begged him to stop. 'Please, please!' I screamed, half-tormented, half-ecstatic. He snorted like a bull and wouldn't let up. Then my mother was pounding on the door, yelling for us to get out. 'Don't listen to her,' my father said, turning off the water, wrapping me in a thick white towel. I sat on the toilet and watched him while he shaved. Talking to me, not paying attention, he caught the razor in the cleft of his chin and put a plaster over the blood. Back home, I reported all this to Sullivan - excluding the shower scene. 'I told you they needed to be goosed,' he said. He continued his paper chase with the tenacity of a pit bull. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, no death benefits had been paid on anyone with my father's name. This meant that unless he was living under an alias or foregoing his Social Security benefits, he wasn't dead. When I grew impatient with this slow process, Sullivan suggested another tack. Apparently, Health and Human Services has a policy of helping family members track down missing relatives in emergency situations. For this to happen, I needed to write an open letter to my father which they would forward to anyone with his name. Sullivan suggested that I include a photograph of myself with the letter. I spent a day deciding what image I wanted my father to see - with hair or without - and decided finally on the balding truth. I felt a stab of ridiculous, vain regret that he hadn't know me in my halcyon days - as if he would've loved a curly-haired son more than one with a wispy monk's tonsure. I wrote an awkward open letter (knowing it would be read by strangers), explaining that I had contracted a 'possibly fatal virus', and ending with a polite request for my father to 'contact me immediately', with no strings attached. I assured him that my mother did not need to know about our meeting. Then I sealed the envelope and sent it off to some bureaucrat in Washington DC. Nothing happened. Two weeks passed, then four, then six. The excitement of the chase began to wane; intrigue was replaced by cynicism, then by impending defeat. My sister Belle was more disappointed than I was and wept on the telephone. 'He's never gonna see my kids,' she said, 'or even know what I look like.' Belle had become my reality check, my reminder of what was really at stake here, which my writer's distance could nearly blur out. 'It's not over yet,' I told her, barely hiding my own doubt. 'Sullivan's good. If our father's out there, he'll find him.' 'Do you even care?' Belle asked, sounding like I was a heartless wretch. 'I'm not really sure.' In the middle of May, Sullivan called to say he was on to something. A James J Matousek with an Illinois Social Security number had turned up somewhere in California. When I pressed the detective for details, he was cagey about the suspect's exact whereabouts, and said he wanted to do 'recon naissance' before we went any further. Also, there seemed to be a hitch: the files of this guy's current account had been purged. 'Purged?' I asked. 'What does that mean?' 'Beats the hell out of me.' It turned out that this particular suspect was last seen in Pasadena, a few minutes' drive from where my father had originally left us. In the weeks that followed, Sullivan learned that no obituary for James J Matousek had been published i n that vicinity. He charmed a librarian into researching the Mountain View Cemetery, Pasadena's most popular burial ground, but she could not find a grave. For the first time since the search began, Sullivan seemed flummoxed. 'All roads end in 1989,' he wrote to me in a memo. 'Not sure what this means, but I will continue to trace him.' Shortly afterward, I left the city to spend the summer in Santa Fe, determined not to put my life on hold for what may end up being a wild-goose chase. I settled into a house with a view of the Sangre de Cristo mountains to work on a book, and do my best to put my father, Sullivan and the memos behind me. Thirty-two years without my father had hardened me against hope. And now, with a change of location, the prospects of finding him turned even more spectral, like the cow skull hanging above the front door. It was a relief to have half-given up. I felt righteous for having tried and failed. Then one morning, my boyfriend Louis and I came home to a message from Mack Sullivan on the answering machine. 'Call me immediately,' he said. 'We've found him.' From the time I was very small, I was told that I had my father's face. 'Look at him!' my older sisters would marvel. 'The profile, the way he walks. Exactly like Jim.' My mother would shake her head as if to say, 'Don't encourage him', and they'd stop. She didn't realise how much I needed to hear this, how I needed to look like someone other than myself and Belle. Everyone in our house was fat and dark; she and I were blond and skinny, like aliens that blew in through the window and never really belonged. Then one day while I was still in New York, my aunt Ruth called up. 'I found him!' she exclaimed. 'The movie, I mean.' 'What movie?' I asked. 'Just come out and see for yourself.' I wangled a press trip to California, and immediately drove to Aunt Ruth's house. She put a reel on the projector, and a shaky home movie flickered on to the screen. The camera followed my mother while she rushed around in capris and a tie-up blouse, serving burgers and beers to people at a party. Then the lens zoomed in on a wavy-haired man with an angular face, T-shirt sleeves rolled up around his biceps. The man turned to the camera, smiled, and I saw, with a shock, my own face mirrored back at me. 'My God!' I said out loud, staring into my father's eyes, seeing where I'd come from for the first time in my adult life. I sat there studying my father's face, the receding hairline like mine, the sunken cheeks, long nose, deep-set melancholy eyes, hardly able to believe the chilling resemblance. It filled me with a tirade of feelings - vindication, excitement, sadness, redemption, confusion, loneliness, rage. I sat there staring a long time, memorising his face again, letting the fact of my father sink in. 'We told you, honey,' said Aunt Ruth. 'Remember?' I called Sullivan back. 'If this isn't him, I'll turn in my licence,' he told me. I said nothing. 'You OK?' he asked. 'I'm not sure.' 'Scared?' 'Uh huh.' 'Who wouldn't be?' The detective told me what he knew. Apparently, Sullivan tracked down this suspect through his neighbours, who provided the unlisted phone number. Sullivan himself called 'on a ruse' and heard two names on the answering machine. 'He lives with another man,' he says. 'A foreigner.' 'Now what?' I asked. 'You call him.' Suddenly, I felt cornered. 'What do I say?' 'Tell him you're his long-lost son. Tell him you're his pride and joy. Tell him that he ruined your life.' 'What?' 'Just kidding,' he said. 'Here's the number. Call me after you make contact.' I couldn't do it. For 24 hours, the scrap of paper with the Pasadena phone number sat by the phone accusingly. Every time I thought about calling, I got into a panic. What had begun somewhat casually had become a little too real for comfort. With the imminent prospect of actually speaking to my father, I realised how completely unprepared I was for this to happen. Together, Louis and I ran through all the how-will-you-feel-if's that we could conjure. I prepared myself for every form of rejection, disappointment, disillusionment, insult and seduction I could imagine. Finally, I hit on the weirdest possibility of all. 'He lives with another man!' I said. 'No,' said Louis, getting my drift. 'You never know. Two men in their seventies playing house. In Pasadena.' 'You're crazy.' Still, the more I thought of it, the more sense this theory began to make. Details started to tie together: my father's handwriting, my mother's innuendoes, his sudden departure, his macho cover-up. Could it be that my father had left because he had no other choice, and how would that change my view of what he'd done? I fantasised about our reunion, pictured us introducing our mates, summer trips to Ischia, marches arm in arm with ACT UP. Gently, Louis tried bursting my bubble. 'A lot of older men live together for companionship,' he said. 'Not my dad,' I answered, the word sounding strange in my mouth. 'Should I call him Dad? Or Pop? Or Father?' 'Just call him!' Louis made me promise to phone Pasadena Jim the next morning, no matter what. That night I could hardly sleep. Every time I got up to pee, I saw the number staring at me in the dark, like a miracle, right in my face. In the past 20 years, I have interviewed rock stars, movie stars, millionaires, Nobel Prize winners, rapists and people on their deathbeds. I have prided myself on nerves of steel when it came to extemporaneous chat, but that morning, dialling Jim Matousek's number, I was - for all practical purposes - four years old again. He wasn't home. I thought I recognised the voice on the machine and hung up without leaving a message. I tried again, then again, then again, chickening out each time. Finally, I left a polite message asking him to call me back, collect. He didn't. As the days passed, I convinced myself that he'd fled the country at the sound of my voice, too mortified to confront me. On 8 August, I left one final, detailed message, telling Pasadena Jim exactly who I was and why I was calling. 'If you don't want to talk to me,' I said, unable to hide the hurt in my voice, 'then have someone else call me back and say so, immediately. Please.' He called the next afternoon. When I heard his name, I held my breath. 'Dad?' I said. 'Is that you?' 'Mark?' 'Yes?' 'I'm not your dad.' I looked out the window at the mountains. For a moment, I couldn't speak. 'You've got to be,' I said finally. 'I'm not.' 'But I have proof.' He chuckled. 'Oh really?' 'Really. 'I don't think so,' he said, then told me that he'd never been married or had any children. He told me he wished he could help me. I opened my mouth but no words came out. Louis was sitting on the floor, shaking his head, looking dubious. Finally, I apologised for bothering him. 'No bother at all,' he assured me. 'Understandable mistake.' 'By the way,' I asked, 'what colour are your eyes?' 'Hell if I know,' the old man said. 'Blue, I think.' 'Not grey?' 'I'm colour-blind, son,' he told me. 'So am I,' I say. 'Isn't that a coincidence?' 'Isn't it?' I answered. Then I hung up the phone with a lump in my throat, unsure of what had just happened. It was worse for Belle, when I told her. She doesn't have the consolation of knowing, as I do, that our father wanted her with him. My aunt Ruth said it was better this way. My mother snapped back to her coldness, saying she always knew he was dead. Finally, I called Mack Sullivan, who simply couldn't believe it. 'Impossible,' he repeated several times. 'I was so sure. The chances. The odds. Something just doesn't add up here.' 'Sorry, Mack. He's not my father.' 'Well, I'll be damned_' Sullivan's voice trailed off. Then he offered to keep trying even though his sources had dried up. I told him not to bother. Mystery is an acquired taste. When you've been weaned on uncertainty, grown up in a forest of question marks, improvised your very self from scraps and lies and innuendo, you acclimatise to unfinished business and the notion of life as a defective puzzle. After my last talk with the detective, two years passed in a hectic blur: I finished my book, my mother succumbed to lung cancer, and my own prognosis improved drastically with the advent of effective treatments. Then one stormy day in 1997, while visiting my family in California, I found myself in a rented car on the highway to Pasadena, looking for the address that Mack Sullivan had sent with a note in case I ever changed my mind. The rain was lashing the windshield as I followed the road map, past the cemetery where we'd buried my mother. Had it been necessary for her to die, I wondered, before I could make this final journey? Or, rather, was it because she was gone that I now felt the urge for my father again? I can't say for certain but as I struggled to find his street through the deluge, I felt as if something important were coming, and was far more nervous than I had expected. After several wrong turns, I finally located the address and stopped in front of a modest stucco duplex set back behind a fenced-in garden. I pulled over to the curb and turned off the engine. The steering wheel was damp from the sweat of my palms. I saw no sign of anyone home, no porch light or car in the driveway, but I'd promised myself to wait around for as long as this took. I smoked two cigarettes in a row, practised smiling in the mirror, chewed a very strong breathmint, then I opened the car door and walked quickly through the rain to the porch. The draperies were closed with no light on inside. The neighbour's dog started yapping madly. I held my breath and pushed the bell. No response. I rang again. A minute passed and still no answer. I opened the screen and knocked on the door, first gently, then with a rap, but the house appeared to be empty. I crossed the porch and pushed the neighbour's bell, sending the dog into a frenzy, then heard someone mutter behind the door. A magnified eye appeared at the peephole. When I waved, the hole snapped shut. I sat on Pasadena Jim's porch and waited. Five minutes passed. Fifteen. Twenty. Before I retreated to the car, I pushed the doorbell one last time. The door cracked open right away. 'Can I help you?' a man asked, his face invisible behind the screen. 'Mr Matousek?' I said. 'You'll have to speak up, son. My hearing aid is in the shop.' 'Are you Jim Matousek?' I asked louder, still unable to make out the face. 'I sure am. Can I help you?' I hesitated before I answered. The rain was blowing in sideways torrents, splashing the porch steps, drenching my boots. For a second I wanted to run away, as my father had done that night in his truck, just turn around and disappear and leave him waiting without an answer. I thought of revenge, but just for a moment, then I got a glimpse of his eyes in the porch light he flipped on to see me better. They seemed to be grey. His face was unshaven. He looked at me with enormous kindness. 'Can I help you?' he asked again. \u0095 The Boy He Left Behind: A Man's Search for His Lost Father by Mark Matousek has just been published by Piatkus.",

(Happily, Methuen is planning to republish it - anyone who ever has to deal with actors should keep a copy handy.) And now he is emerging as a seriously good novelist. His first novel, The Right Man, published in 1998, was promising, but his second one, Faking It, which comes out this month, is excellent, a sort of cross between Nick Hornby and Kingsley Amis, if you can imagine such a thing. </p> <p>But, maddeningly, he is an actor first and currently very excited about a new play he is in, called Feelgood, by Alistair Beaton, about the backstage spin-doctoring at a Labour Party conference. I saw it at Hampstead Theatre and found it amusing - but that's never enough for actors: you have to say it's the most side-splitting comedy you've ever seen in your life. Visiting Planer at home the morning after the first night, I found him frantically leafing through the papers in search of reviews - luckily, there was a good one in The Guardian with a 'nice mention' for him. He said it was vital to get good reviews because then the play would get a West End run (it is currently on tour) and he'd get some proper dosh, instead of the \u00a3200 a week he is paid out of town. He stays awake at night worrying about money. He has a new wife and a new baby to support. </p> <p>They are currently living in hideous chaos in a tiny rented house in Twickenham while their slightly larger new house opposite is being done up. They can look out of the window and see the builders shovelling money into the moneypit - they have been at work on the house for three years . It is a precarious business, living in this sort of borderland of celebrity. On the one hand, he is 'famous' enough for Hello! to pay for exclusive coverage of his wedding - on the other hand, he is obviously not rich. Compared to his fellow Young Ones, Rik and Ade, he is definitely the poor relation. </p> <p>He shot to fame with The Young Ones in his mid-twenties and spent most of his thirties coming down. 'I was working so hard in the 80s, I kind of tried to do everything and I reached a burnout, I think, because I was with a group - Rik and Ade, who are so brilliant, and Alexei Sayle and French and Saunders - and I kind of made a mistake, I suppose, in trying to be like them.' He kept writing television scripts which were meant to be starring vehicles for himself, but finally 'I had to realise I'm not that kind of person - I'm not a personality.' </p> <p>I see what he means - he is not 'larger than life', thank God, he is not starry. But he is an actor with an actor's fear of how he'll be perceived by the public. Occasionally he'll be talking away and suddenly stop and say, 'Oh God, you're a journalist!' and start fretting about how some anodyne remark might be misconstrued. He seems to imagine an audience of Guardian - Observer wimmin scanning his speech for any hint of sexism or politically incorrect views. I asked at one point whether he'd ever been to call girls (because both his novels contain sympathetic characters who are call girls) and he almost yelped with fear and said no, no, he couldn't possibly condone the sex industry or the exploitation of women. Which of course wasn't quite what I asked. </p> <p>But that is what makes his novel, Faking It, so intriguing - the constant flip-flop between two views of masculinity, personified by the two main characters. Oliver the osteopath is a goody-goody New Man who attends men's groups and worries about caffeine; Barry is an unreconstructed Neanderthal journalist who is pissed all the time. Planer admits that both characters are based on him, or rather, both are exaggerated versions of two sides of his personality. Superficially he is much more like Oliver - earnest, health-conscious, high-minded - but he says he had a Barry period when he was living on a houseboat in Chelsea and drinking too much between marriages (and perhaps also observing the call girls at Chelsea Harbour). I don't want to give the plot away, but whereas Oliver appears to have all the virtues and Barry all the vices, by the end the position is pretty well reversed. </p> <p>For all its playfulness and comedy, Faking It deals with serious moral issues - about how to be a good man and not a bastard; how to have a serious, caring, mutually respectful relationship despite having a bit of a penchant for top-shelf magazines. I suppose the concerns are very specific to Planer's generation - the now-fortysomethings who came to manhood just in time to be told that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle. Nick Hornby and Tony Parsons cover similar ground but not, I think, as deeply and honestly as Planer. They manage to fudge the sex issue by largely ignoring it, whereas he tackles the essential problem that the penis is a wayward beast which doesn't necessarily sign up for all the tenets of feminism. Can you say you're in love with your partner if you still have fantasies about spanking Miss July? </p> <p>Planer told me that he once read a women's magazine (he often reads women's magazines) in which two agony aunts - one a Relate counsellor and the other a page three girl - answered a question from a male reader, viz: 'I want to look at porn with my girlfriend because it turns me on, but she thinks it's disgusting.' The page three girl thought it was OK as long as he explained to his girlfriend that it didn't mean he didn't fancy her. But the counsellor said: You must touch a woman gently and buy her flowers and absolutely no porn. </p> <p>'Which I thought,' Planer concludes, 'was completely unhelpful and probably going to ruin their relationship. In a perfect world, he should have been able to do a deal with his girlfriend and say, I'll give you the roses and the warmth and the intimacy thing, if once a month or so we can look at porn together. Then they would have had a shame-free relationship. Barry in the novel's got a lovely line where he says: \"I just want some depersonalised voyeuristic sex with the woman I love every now and then. Is that too much to ask?\" But he does say with \"the woman I love\", not the woman I want to exploit.' </p> <p> Planer's own love life has been complicated. His first partner was much older than him, his two wives much younger, he has never gone out with anyone his own age. In fact, he says he has never 'gone out' with anyone - all his relationships have either been casual or deeply serious. 'Maybe I'm a dinosaur. I mean, it's more fun to play the field, quite honestly, and if you're going to commit to somebody, then why not bloody get on with it - why do things by halves?' </p> <p>He fell into his first relationship, with Roberta Green, because he rented a room in her house, so he was her tenant before he was her lover. When they met, she was a speech therapist (like his mother) but he helped to support her while she re-trained as an analyst and she is now quite well-known. He was in his early twenties, she was in her late thirties, and had two teenage children. It made him grow up very fast - he feels he jumped straight from adolescence to midlife crisis. 'Because I was thrown in at the deep end - the children were 12 and 10, and I stayed for eight years, so I went right through their teenage years when I was in my mid-twenties, which is a helluva battle - too young to be a father to them and too old to be a friend. I think, probably, if you were writing the plot of my life, that was the inciting incident.' </p> <p>Why do young men fall for older women? 'I can't answer for anybody else. I just know how boring all the other girls seemed in my mid-twenties, and how scary as well. They want all sorts of things and they've got no wisdom. It was much more interesting to have someone you could actually talk to.' But surely there must be some deeper explanation? Oliver the osteopath in Faking It has a relationship with a much older woman and says he sees it as 'a way of getting out of having to have children'. But Planer says firmly that that's Oliver speaking, not him. </p> <p>He is still good friends with Green, her children and, now, her seven grandchildren. But when that relationship broke up, he married a much, much younger woman, Anna Leigh, a model whom he met at a disco in Lanzarote - she was 22, he 35. Again, there was no courtship because she got pregnant almost immediately - 'It was a mad romantic rush and then it was: Right, let's decorate the nursery.' He loved having a son, Stanley, but the marriage was 'an absolute catastrophe' and ended in 1995. </p> <p>This is when he had his Barry period, living on a houseboat in Chelsea, drinking too much and sowing his wild oats. He felt he'd missed out in his twenties, when he was being a stepfather, and anyway, 'It's easier to be a lad when you're in your forties,' he believes, 'because you can sort of take it or leave it. You're not so puppy-like and it's more of a laugh.' So was he very promiscuous? He goes all panicky at the question. 'I don't know that I should answer that! I have done that, but not as a habit.' </p> <p>Anyway, soon he met Frankie Park, an actress who was also a single parent with a son the same age as Stanley. They married in 1999 and had Harvey, who is now 18 months. It was Frankie who said 'Go for it' when Hello! offered 'serious money' for exclusive coverage of their wedding and new baby. 'She's much more extrovert than me anyway, much more confident and outgoing.' She is also gorgeous looking and, he says, a 'bloody funny' actress, but the roles are few and far between. Like him, she has turned to novel-writing, and is now working on her second. </p> <p>Before Planer wrote novels, he wrote sort-of spoof books, on acting, on therapy, on divorce. Ironically, the latter, Let's Get Divorced!, came out just when his first marriage was breaking up and it suddenly wasn't funny. 'I was having to do interviews, with everybody asking so what about your divorce? It was a bit of a turning point to realise that discretion is probably required, whereas before that I thought, Anything's a joke, really. So then I decided to write fiction instead because - I think it was Graham Greene who said the difference between a journalist and a novelist is that a novelist can write the truth and the journalist has to write lies.' </p> <p>His first novel, The Right Man, is about a man whose marriage has broken up and who is fighting to maintain contact with his child - obviously to some extent autobiographical. Planer didn't want to be a Saturdays-only father, he wanted to be a full-time dad, and he assumed that having shared the childcare during the marriage, he would continue to share it after the divorce. But he had a rude awakening: English courts still almost automatically award custody to the mother. In the end, he became 'a part-time full-time dad' and had Stanley to live with him for a third of the year. But now, much to his sorrow, his ex-wife has remarried and moved abroad and he only sees Stanley in the school holidays. 'I don't want to go into it too much - anything sets me off - he's only just gone, only a year ago.' </p> <p>In his post-divorce anguish, Planer got deeply involved with men's groups, including Families Need Fathers, which campaigns for fathers' rights. He still attends their meetings and has written the introduction for their new handbook. But his novel contains a wickedly funny send-up of a men's group - The Men Who Run Away from Wolves - and its hideously sanctimonious leader. It is hard to see how anyone could ever attend a men's group after reading it. So where does Planer stand? 'I'm still on the fence. I think there is a sort of awakening with men, but it's very difficult to talk about it without making it sound chippy or rightwing or anti-women. But there are a lot of issues - it is true that there is no widower's pension; it is true that if you're not married the woman can change the name of your children and take them away, and all of those issues are discriminatory and sexist against men. And men don't believe they have a right to have feelings in the home or to be sad or to cry - in the home what they have to face is isolation and alienation.' </p> <p>He is a veteran of groups and therapies, analysis and alternative medicine. He wrote a good book called Therapy and How to Avoid It , which, though a spoof, is actually quite informative. He warns particularly to beware of Kleinians who believe that treatment only ends when the analyst dies. He had a go at one-to-one analysis but found it unsatisfactory - 'because there's a danger, as an actor, that you can beguile the therapist'. He preferred group therapy and went to it for years, though he has recently stopped. </p> <p>But why does he need all this therapy - why is he so screwed up? 'Well, thank you for asking that! I'll need another six years in therapy to decide that one! Maybe I'm not really screwed up. I kind of use it because it's all I've got, to make comedy and writing. I don't think I'm that screwed up. I am very highly strung.' </p> <p>OK - why is he so highly strung? It sounds as though he had a perfectly normal childhood - he is the middle of three brothers, and very close to the others. His parents were married for 56 years till his mother's death last year; she was a speech therapist, his father ran a company making medical equipment. They lived in Sheen and there was enough money to send all three sons to fee-paying schools - Westminster, in his case. The only remotely odd thing was that his father was Austrian and 'very European, just better , really, more olive oil in the blood or something. So that sort of gung-ho British maleness, that anal British thing about, You must be a poof if you're not behaving like a complete dickhead - I just don't get it.' </p> <p>But it sounds as though he was pretty weird as a young man. His weight fluctuated alarmingly - he was very skinny as a small child, then so fat at school that he was called Piggy, then very skinny again. 'When I was 21, I was 8st - which at 6ft 3in is very thin - I had to go into hospital. And then by my mid-thirties, when we had a baby - I suppose it's couvade - I was nearly 16st.' He had a druggy period at Sussex University, then a period of being an intense fitness freak. When he was doing The Young Ones , he was so obsessed with his diet he had to take all his own bread to Australia. 'For four years, I didn't smoke or have caffeine, or foods with any \"e\" markings. I couldn't have any chemicals at all. I was just detoxing. But for four years! I went bonkers, It cleared up my eczema and allergies, but I was completely neurotic and irritable. Fussy, you know, and sort of unpleasant and stroppy. And then when I decided against that and thought, No , bugger it, I'll go mad, I'll have lots of meat and cigarettes and wine whenever I feel like it - of course then you put on weight and get a bad back. But it's much healthier, I think, if you just say what you think and do what you like.' </p> <p>Hmmm - but he still seems to have some hang ups about food. He spent ages dithering over the menu at lunch, debating whether or not to have 'the full meaty thing', then spent at least an hour pushing a slice of Parma ham round his plate. Until recently, he confides, he suffered from a bad back, bad sinuses and irritable bowel syndrome and used to go to different specialists, but finally cured the whole lot by wearing a plastic denture for a year to alter his bite. 'It sounds crazy, but I'd say I'm half an inch taller than I used to be, and the constant pain and symptoms have gone - isn't that extraordinary? You say it to people and they think you're a nut, but I am healthier by biting differently.' </p> <p>So now, in theory, he is 100 per cent fit. He has stopped going to group therapy, stopped worrying about his bowels and sinuses and bad back. Now all he has to worry about is money. He makes his living from many different sources - writing books, theatre acting (he did a year in Chicago in the West End); television acting (he plays the father in The Grimleys); lots of voiceovers and audiobooks (he reads all the Terry Pratchet novels). He also has a production company, Elephant, which produces mainly children's cartoons (some of them written by his brothers) and says that, after seven years, it is finally in profit. And now he has written Faking It, which certainly deserves to be a bestseller. </p> <p>He already has plans for his third novel, which he wants to call The Long Night of the Penis. This time, he says, it will have a main woman character who is not dead. But it all depends on whether he can afford to take six months off to get properly stuck into the novel and whether Feelgood will go into the West End. Selfishly, I want him to fail as an actor so he'll be forced to become a novelist, but I fear he would prefer the reverse. He says he's been acting for 30 years and 'It kind of gets better the older you get. The competition's less and it doesn't matter what you look like. And what's so brilliant about it is from a very early age you work alongside people of all generations and all different classes, from all over the country.' And all different personalities? 'Well no, in that sense, not so good, because they are all actors!'</p> <p>\u0095 Feelgood is at the Hampstead Theatre, 98 Avenue Road, Swiss Cottage Centre, London NW3 (020 7722 9301) until 10 March.</p>",

His weight fluctuated alarmingly - he was very skinny as a small child, then so fat at school that he was called Piggy, then very skinny again. 'When I was 21, I was 8st - which at 6ft 3in is very thin - I had to go into hospital. And then by my mid-thirties, when we had a baby - I suppose it's couvade - I was nearly 16st.' He had a druggy period at Sussex University, then a period of being an intense fitness freak. When he was doing The Young Ones , he was so obsessed with his diet he had to take all his own bread to Australia. 'For four years, I didn't smoke or have caffeine, or foods with any \"e\" markings. I couldn't have any chemicals at all. I was just detoxing. But for four years! I went bonkers, It cleared up my eczema and allergies, but I was completely neurotic and irritable. Fussy, you know, and sort of unpleasant and stroppy. And then when I decided against that and thought, No , bugger it, I'll go mad, I'll have lots of meat and cigarettes and wine whenever I feel like it - of course then you put on weight and get a bad back. But it's much healthier, I think, if you just say what you think and do what you like.' Hmmm - but he still seems to have some hang ups about food. He spent ages dithering over the menu at lunch, debating whether or not to have 'the full meaty thing', then spent at least an hour pushing a slice of Parma ham round his plate. Until recently, he confides, he suffered from a bad back, bad sinuses and irritable bowel syndrome and used to go to different specialists, but finally cured the whole lot by wearing a plastic denture for a year to alter his bite. 'It sounds crazy, but I'd say I'm half an inch taller than I used to be, and the constant pain and symptoms have gone - isn't that extraordinary? You say it to people and they think you're a nut, but I am healthier by biting differently.' So now, in theory, he is 100 per cent fit. He has stopped going to group therapy, stopped worrying about his bowels and sinuses and bad back. Now all he has to worry about is money. He makes his living from many different sources - writing books, theatre acting (he did a year in Chicago in the West End); television acting (he plays the father in The Grimleys); lots of voiceovers and audiobooks (he reads all the Terry Pratchet novels). He also has a production company, Elephant, which produces mainly children's cartoons (some of them written by his brothers) and says that, after seven years, it is finally in profit. And now he has written Faking It, which certainly deserves to be a bestseller. He already has plans for his third novel, which he wants to call The Long Night of the Penis. This time, he says, it will have a main woman character who is not dead. But it all depends on whether he can afford to take six months off to get properly stuck into the novel and whether Feelgood will go into the West End. Selfishly, I want him to fail as an actor so he'll be forced to become a novelist, but I fear he would prefer the reverse. He says he's been acting for 30 years and 'It kind of gets better the older you get. The competition's less and it doesn't matter what you look like. And what's so brilliant about it is from a very early age you work alongside people of all generations and all different classes, from all over the country.' And all different personalities? 'Well no, in that sense, not so good, because they are all actors!' \u0095 Feelgood is at the Hampstead Theatre, 98 Avenue Road, Swiss Cottage Centre, London NW3 (020 7722 9301) until 10 March.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer:</strong> What is Death in Holy Orders about? </p> <p> <strong> PD James:</strong> It's a classical British detective story. I've got the central mysterious death, the closed circle of suspects with means, motive and opportunity, a detective who comes in like an avenging deity, and a solution which the reader should be able to arrive at by a process of logical deduction from clues. It is also a novel about the state of the Church of England. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Trollope makes a number of appearances. Were you consciously revisiting a latter-day Barsetshire? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> He is one of my favourite novelists, but I don't think I was revisiting Barchester, even subconsciously. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Was there a moment of inspiration for the book ? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> I think it was the combination of wishing to set it in an institution and to set it on the loneliest part of the East Anglian coast. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Which you're very fond of. </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> It is the setting for many of my novels. There have been too many detective novels set in universities and colleges. In my view, both Oxford and Cambridge have been rather overdone. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> You refer to Dorothy L Sayers, Margery Allingham and Ngaio Marsh. Are you within that tradition? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> They're not models but I think I am within that tradition. The detective story has moved much closer to mainstream fiction. It no longer affirms with such confidence the probity of the state system, including the police. Detectives are far less creatures of fantasy or romantic wish-fulfilment. They tend to be professionals doing a difficult job in a modern world. One of the great virtues of the detective story in the 1930s was that it gave an extraordinary description of life as it was then. If you want to know what it was like to work in an advertising agency in London between the wars, then read Murder Must Advertise.</p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> You don't include Agatha Christie. </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> She's in a different league. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Inferior? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> As a novelist, she can't write with the others, but her achievement was absolutely astonishing. It may be easy to criticise her as a stylist, but she gave pleasure to millions of people. I think of her a literary conjuror. She has her cards and she shifts them with those cunning fingers until, of course, the reader reads enough to see the kind of trickery she operates. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> What is the attraction of murder? You write: 'He had sometimes wondered whether this almost visceral thrill wasn't uncomfortably close to blood lust. Certainly it was something of a blood sport.' Is that how you feel? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> Murder is the unique crime; it's the only one for which we can never make reparation to the victim. We feel that the murderer steps over an invisible line which divides him or her forever from the rest of us. It is an astonishing act and we regard it with horrified fascination. I think most of us are capable of quite atrocious sins, but I do believe that comparatively few of us are capable of deliberately planning the death of another human being. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you believe in original sin? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> I do believe to the extent that I don't think we come into the world as unselfish, kind and loving. I think we come in as selfish little animals. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you believe in God? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> Yes, I do. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> What kind of god? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> At a very young age, I moved away from the idea of the benign gentleman up there in the sky. I think I always believed that God was not visible. I always thought of him as an indwelling spirit. I certainly believe that he is love, which means that I've never been able to explain or have never heard a satisfactory explanation of the existence of suffering, particularly the suffering of the innocent. To reconcile a god who is both loving and omnipotent with the suffering of the good and the innocent is very problematic. Difficult is hardly the word for it. Nevertheless, I do continue to believe in the existence of God, that He is loving and that it is possible to be in contact with Him. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Did you always want to be a writer? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> Absolutely. I never doubted that this is what I could do and wanted to do and psychologically needed to do. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> So it's a need? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> Yes. One psychiatrist -I think it may have been Anthony Storr - said creativity is the successful resolution of internal conflict. The psychological need to be a writer was greater than a psychological need to be successful. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What was the trigger that moved you from having a recognition that you were a writer into writing books? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> It was sometime in the mid 1950s when I suddenly realised that there was never going to be a convenient moment to write the first book. You become a writer by writing. I had to make it happen. If I didn't, I would eventually be saying to my grandchildren that what I wanted to be was a novelist. That really was like a thunderclap of realisation. I had to get started, so I got started. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> With what?</p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> Cover Her Face, a traditional detective story. That one is more in the tradition of Agatha Christie than it is in the tradition of Marjorie Allingham. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What did you read when you were growing up? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> Well, I lived in a house where there were very few books, but from an early age I read The Wind in the Willows. I loved it because I loved the security of having a little den on the riverbank. It was a very secure world. I suppose I read most of the children's classics like Alice in Wonderland, but I liked realistic stories. I didn't want my heroine to go down rabbit holes. I wanted to be in a recognisable world. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> You're very much a realist writer. </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> Yes I am. I don't like magic realism and I don't really like fantasy. Of course I accept that fiction is an artificial form. The detective story may be more artificial than most, but every work of fiction is a way in which the writer has used his or her interests, compulsions, perhaps neuroses, to provide a fictional world which he or she hopes will be attractive to the reader. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you write quickly or slowly? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> I can write quite quickly. It is the plotting and planning which take the time and those can't be hurried. It's as if the characters exist already, their story, everything about them is in some limbo of my imagination and I'm getting in touch with them and getting the story down in black and white, rather than inventing any of it. So it does feel as if it's a process of revelation rather than creation and one which is not really within my own volition. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Is Dalgliesh based on anyone? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> No, he's not. Absolutely not. I wanted him to be a good, professional policeman, but I also wanted him to be a sensitive human being and to have some kind of artistic interest. I gave him the qualities that I admired personally, because I thought if I don't like him personally I'm going to get extremely bored with him, if I'm lucky enough to be able to carry through a series. Also, I didn't want to worry with his love life so I rather callously killed off his wife and child. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> This book is vintage PD James. It's got a number of very violent deaths, it's got incest, child abuse, dysfunctional families. Yet here you are - Baroness James, a pillar of the Establishment. It's funny, isn't it? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> You mean the contrast? This 80-year-old benign grandmother and what's going on in my imagination? But I suppose I'm aware of the real world. There's the world out there and the world of my own imagination. </p> <p>Motive has become very difficult in modern detective stories. Motive has to be strong. In real life, motive is seldom strong. A lust for money, for a lot of money, is still a strong motive, as are hatred and the need for revenge, the feeling I can't go on living comfortably in the world while my enemy exists. But of course if we're thinking of things like blackmail, you'd far more likely to be subject to it today if you had child abuse in your past than you would if you had a very vivid sex life or even cheated your employer. They are the fashionable sins. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> When you write about child abuse or blackmail, are they imagined or is there any trace of recognition in you of these emotions? </p> <p> <strong> James:</strong> There is a trace in me to the extent that I seem able to imagine what the feeling would be. Sometimes that feeling is almost universal - we've all felt fear. Every woman knows the fear of feeling that she's being followed in the dark, so it's not difficult. At some time, we've all felt jealousy. I'm sure most of us have felt a murderous rage at one time. Yes, the writer does find the emotion within herself. </p> <p>\u0095 PD James is the author of 14 novels, including Death of an Expert Witness, many of which have been adapted for television. She was made a life peer in 1991.</p>",

      "byline": "Robert McCrum",

      "body": "<p>The printed book is a brilliant 'random access device'. It is, as the novelist Nicholson Baker once observed, 'a beautifully browsable invention that needs no electricity and exists in a readable form, no matter what happens. If the end of civilisation comes and we lose electricity, we can hold a CD-Rom up to the light and it has a totemic value, but we have no past.' </p> <p>The printed book is also a world-class survivor. A renaissance artefact first marketed in this country by an energetic literary hustler named William Caxton, it has kept pace with virtually every technological change you care to think of, from the internal combustion engine to television. If Caxton were to walk into his local branch of Waterstone's today, he would not recognise the fascinating technology of our everyday life, but he would be surprised to find that the thing he called a 'boke' was, in its essentials, pretty much unchanged after 500 years. </p> <p>What's more, the printed book stands for a mode of thought - deliberate, ruminative and private - that's a cornerstone of our civilisation. The paper, the ink, the cover and the feel of the thing are precious to us in ways we probably can't quite quantify. A book offers an independent route into a shared past as well as a secret avenue into a personal future. It is, in a word, inimitable. </p> <p>Or is it? Last week saw some news that will have caused the traditional book lover a momentary frisson of disquiet. HarperCollins UK, the British publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch's empire, announced that its e-book division was not only to publish Nobel laureate Gao Xingjian's novel, Soul Mountain, on the internet, but would follow this up with a further 100 titles before Christmas. This list of e-books includes work by Joyce Carol Oates, Bernard Cornwell and the childrens' cult writer, RL Stine. </p> <p>HarperCollins's list is significant. In the recent past, whenever publishers have done deals with e-book people, they've made sure that their crown jewels, bestsellers like John Grisham, Danielle Steele or Tom Clancy, are somehow not part of the transaction. The inclusion of heavy hitters such as Cornwell and Stine shows that HarperCollins is deadly serious about this initiative. </p> <p>It's probably right to be. For most of the 1990s, e-book technology remained at the clunky R&amp;D stage.

      "bodyText": "The printed book is a brilliant 'random access device'. It is, as the novelist Nicholson Baker once observed, 'a beautifully browsable invention that needs no electricity and exists in a readable form, no matter what happens. If the end of civilisation comes and we lose electricity, we can hold a CD-Rom up to the light and it has a totemic value, but we have no past.' The printed book is also a world-class survivor. A renaissance artefact first marketed in this country by an energetic literary hustler named William Caxton, it has kept pace with virtually every technological change you care to think of, from the internal combustion engine to television. If Caxton were to walk into his local branch of Waterstone's today, he would not recognise the fascinating technology of our everyday life, but he would be surprised to find that the thing he called a 'boke' was, in its essentials, pretty much unchanged after 500 years. What's more, the printed book stands for a mode of thought - deliberate, ruminative and private - that's a cornerstone of our civilisation. The paper, the ink, the cover and the feel of the thing are precious to us in ways we probably can't quite quantify. A book offers an independent route into a shared past as well as a secret avenue into a personal future. It is, in a word, inimitable. Or is it? Last week saw some news that will have caused the traditional book lover a momentary frisson of disquiet. HarperCollins UK, the British publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch's empire, announced that its e-book division was not only to publish Nobel laureate Gao Xingjian's novel, Soul Mountain, on the internet, but would follow this up with a further 100 titles before Christmas. This list of e-books includes work by Joyce Carol Oates, Bernard Cornwell and the childrens' cult writer, RL Stine. HarperCollins's list is significant. In the recent past, whenever publishers have done deals with e-book people, they've made sure that their crown jewels, bestsellers like John Grisham, Danielle Steele or Tom Clancy, are somehow not part of the transaction. The inclusion of heavy hitters such as Cornwell and Stine shows that HarperCollins is deadly serious about this initiative. It's probably right to be. For most of the 1990s, e-book technology remained at the clunky R&amp;D stage. Home computers could store the equivalent of 10,000 books, but no one could figure out a way to translate this awesome power into an easily readable form that worked commercially. Not even mega-rich literary entrepreneurs like Stephen King were able to solve this conundrum. King generated a lot of ink when he launched his novel, Riding The Bullet, on the worldwide web, but to the great satisfaction of traditionalists he has eventually been obliged to publish the book as a hardback.

For it was Leon Battista Alberti - not Leonardo da Vinci as we might expect - who first earned the title l'uomo universale from Jacob Burckhardt, the scholar who shaped our modern idea of the Italian Renaissance. In his epoch-making book The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy, Burckhardt conferred that title on Alberti as the ultimate accolade for civilised achievement at the dawn of the modern age. </p> <p>'When the impulse to the highest individual development was combined with a powerful and varied nature, which had mastered all the elements of the culture of the age,' Burckhardt wrote in 1860, 'then arose the \"all-sided man\" - l'uomo universale - who belonged to Italy alone. Among these many-sided men, some, who may truly be called all-sided, tower above the rest.' The greatest of these, Burckhardt continued, was Alberti. </p> <p>According to Burckhardt, Alberti was both genius and pin-up - he could ride the wildest horses and jump from a standing start to the height of the man standing next to him. He was a brilliant cryptographer, invented a kind of camera obscura, wrote plays and treatises in Italian and Latin, dashed off a manual on horses, and was, in his personal life, a charming person and a loyal friend. </p> <p>Beyond the dazzling personal successes, there were the brilliant writings which outlasted him. Posterity remembers Alberti for his masterly treatises on painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as for his handbook for leading a decent and orderly private life in fifteenth-century Florence - his much reprinted On the Family. </p> <p>Above all Alberti is celebrated for his magnificent buildings - closely modelled on the ruins of antiquity, and on classical writings such as Vitruvius's - for some of the most powerful families in Italy, the Malatesta despots in Rimini, the military Gonzagas in Mantua, and the Rucellai millionaires in Florence. Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks ran to thousands of pages of ambitious engineering and design projects, none of which were ever executed. Alberti, by contrast, left us the great cathedral of Sant'Andrea and church of San Sebastiano in Mantua, the facade of Santa Maria Novella in Florence and the incomplete Templo Malatestiano in Rimini. </p> <p>At the end of his life Alberti himself believed that he had left sufficient monuments to gain him a lasting reputation for humaneness: 'Oh! How sweet is the glory that we gain through our efforts. What worthy efforts are ours, through which we may show to those who are not yet alive, that we lived with other values than those of our times, and we have left something of our mind and name besides a mere funeral stone.' </p> <p>So a new book on Alberti is far more than simply another biography. An author who attempts a new appraisal of Alberti stakes his own claim to reframe an entire tradition in understanding our cultural origins in the European Renaissance. The dust jacket of Leon Battista Alberti describes Anthony Grafton as 'one of the greatest living Renaissance scholars', then surveys afresh the lifetime achievements of the greatest of the Renaissance Men. </p> <p>What Grafton gives us is, indeed, a genuine reappraisal which will itself stand the test of time. In lucid and accessible prose he constructs a portrait of an original Renaissance mind, using his own rich knowledge of the education and currents of thought which shaped a fifteenth-century intellectual's development. Alberti is no longer an isolated genius, but robustly the product of his times - a man whose alert intelligence and quick wit made the most sustained use of the resources of antiquity and the ruins of Rome, to which the new movement later dubbed 'humanism' gave him access. </p> <p>Grafton's Alberti reads voraciously, bedrocking his ideas in a fully absorbed understanding of classical languages and rhetoric. He consults widely with artists, engineers and scholars of his day - just as alert to the practical exigencies of daily life as to the idealised pictures painted by philosophers. He responds astutely to the requests of demanding patrons,and is quick to spot career opportunities. </p> <p>Grafton's Alberti, in other words, is a man for our times, to replace Burckhardt's by now outmoded, idealised uomo universale. This towering figure retains the breathtaking range and diversity, but gains, additionally, a hands-on flair for the practical and technical detail, and a clear-headed understanding of the exigencies of power-politics. </p> <p>The biographer of Alberti works with an established canon of documentary materials - the surviving records have been sifted and catalogued to the point that little new is likely to emerge. Not long ago, however, an autograph letter surfaced, written by Alberti in 1454 to his site manager for the Templo Malatestiano project, Matteo de' Pasti. It is a letter preoccupied with the technical problems raised by the need to provide the building with a roof of particularly broad span, testing the limits of contemporary engineering. </p> <p>'Do not trust the existing piers to carry any weight,' he writes, 'and use a light-weight roof form like a wooden barrel vault, to reduce the danger of collapse. </p> <p>'Don't worry,' he continues, 'if the new pier specified in his design does not line up with the old ones - the old ones are not load-bearing, it is only the new ones whose positions are critical to carry the weight of the facade.' </p> <p>At the beginning of the letter Alberti states boldly that he prefers always to follow the example of the great builders of antiquity, rather than to take the advice of contemporaries. Here as elsewhere, however, we watch Alberti wrestling with both extremities of the problem of architectural innovation. There are the glorious examples to be emulated - the Roman Pantheon, or the Arch of Augustus - and then there are the engineering and structural challenges that confront any architect working at the cutting edge of contemporary competence. </p> <p>Grafton's biography of Alberti gives us a portrait of an outstanding individual which finally brings these two sides of his achievement into triumphant coherence and harmony.</p>",

I have never read anything like it. </p> <p>Cook retells Achilles's story, making the reader feel that it exists in a present tense. She is not interested in polite distance: she gets close to the gods, makes them seem real - a feat in itself. Her writing is charged: every moment matters, each word counts, as if time were running out. And this suits her purpose for the book is, in part, trying to beat mortality in a race to the finishing post. </p> <p>There is a tacit contest between those who are immortal and have to survive their loved ones and those who are mortal who regret that they must die. And like a river flowing beneath the story is the implication that life is precious because it is not permanent. There is grief for the same reason: when Odysseus visits Achilles in the underworld and compliments him on appearing to be a king there, Achilles is outraged. He says: 'Don't you know that it's sweeter to be alive - in any shape or form - than lord of all these shadows?' </p> <p>It is an unusual book for a woman to have written: Cook seems to see with a man's eyes. It is as if the writing itself were a heroic enterprise. She writes unflinchingly about death and her occasional imagery is always arresting. (She describes, for instance, a 'sumptuous' hatred spreading through a body 'like cream'.) </p> <p>She writes about love unflinchingly, too. Love involves challenges of every kind: there is a particularly seductive chapter in which Achilles, gorgeously disguised as a girl in silks, is uncovered - in every sense - by his friend Deidamia when the two go swimming together. </p> <p>Water and love converge again when Achilles's father, the mortal King Peleus, makes love to the sea goddess Thetis. This chapter is a terrifying, erotic tour de force, an elemental tussle in which water becomes fire, fire becomes flesh and love resembles war. </p> <p>Love often resembles war in this book. Cook writes beautifully about ambivalence, about loving the thing you hate. Achilles looks at Hector before killing him as if at a lover, seen in the sun. Later, he is transfixed by Hector's shining corpse that looks eerily alive. And when Achilles rides on horseback with Penthiseleia, the queen of the Amazons, she is at once enemy and object of desire. Allied to this is the examination of fate and choice. Can we choose the people we love? We are asked to consider this: 'The way to make your fate is to choose it.' </p> <p>There is an athletic imagination at work here, but it is in the final chapter that Cook takes her most dangerous leap - from Achilles to John Keats. At first, the idea that Keats, short and not obviously bellicose, should have felt any affinity with Achilles comes as a surprise. But Cook, with quotations to shield her story, shows how greatly Achilles affected Keats and through this connection ingeniously extends her meditation on mortality. </p> <p>She describes Keats in an anatomy class looking at the brain. Her own knowledge is striking in itself and she writes as surely as a surgeon while at the same time allowing the fugitive spirit room: 'He remembers the os spehnoidis from Bell's engravings. It reminded him of a giant butterfly with ragged, opulent wings. He touches his temples to feel the furthest reach of the wings that span his head. Feels - Already with thee - his own capacity for flight.' </p> <p>Keats takes a September walk on Hampstead Heath and finds a lock of hair hanging from a tree. The hair recalls the lock cut from Achilles's own head and the hair of the mourners, shed to adorn Achilles's dead body. Loss and gain are plaited together as ingeniously as hair within a Victorian mourning brooch. The chapter is autumnal yet celebratory too - of life passed on through the centuries. </p> <p>At the Cottesloe last Tuesday, Colin Mace read from Achilles to a rapt audience. He found a dynamic humour in the work while preserving its urgency and precision. He was like a magnificent war reporter - bringing us news from another world.</p>",

Readers who closed Undiscovered Country with a sigh may find the follow-up easier to leave.

It's the end of the Sixties and Sandy, an ageing antique dealer on his uppers, is on his way to see his widowed aunt, Constance, who lives alone and shambolically in Sussex, breakfasting on tap water and stale bread from the goats' scrap bucket. Next to Sandy in the Morris Minor is his heart's desire, Ray, a sulky 22-year-old forger who will settle for nothing less than a sugar daddy.

Realising that she has scuppered a moment of intimacy with Sandy, Iseult thinks: 'But that was the way life went. One never knew until the moment was past how important the moment had been.' The moments that stay with you in this novel are the ones in the lively middle section, when Molly Keane gives way to a rather enjoyable Midsummer Night's Dream romp. Connie's houseparty, out for a picnic, collides with a Stones-like rock group (lots of kohl, velvet and feather boas) shooting an album cover on the coast, and the world turns upside down, transformed by marijuana rather than magic. </p> <p>Having put away a large slab of the rock group's 'chocolate' cake, Sandy heads off for a walk. 'Beneath his feet, the chalky stones sparkle like diamonds, shooting out iridescent fragments which adhere to everything around - the grass, the rocks, even Sandy's shoes, which now glitter as bright as Dorothy's ruby slippers.' </p> <p>After this, when things return to abnormal normal again, it's a little disappointing, but Koning is a merciless observer and the best bits of this novel are very good indeed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Of all the ironies surrounding John Diamond's throat cancer (the broadcaster who lost his voice; the brilliant cook's husband who couldn't eat), perhaps the greatest was that, although usually the only person in the room with a terminal illness, he always seemed the most alive. </p> <p>You always saw him first in a crowd, his blaze of blond hair and dandy suits picking him out like a lighthouse in fog; a cluster of people roaring with laughter as John scribbled jokes and observations on a pocket pad faster and more engagingly than anyone else could speak. He laughed a lot, for a dying man: he laughed a lot for any man. He moved in a crackle of energy and wit. If you or I could take only liquids, through a syringe into a stomach tube, we would huddle self-pityingly at home. For John, the only question was how to get champagne down the tube without losing the fizz? </p> <p>At one party, he was approached by a matre d' who took the syringe, gently decanted champagne into the body of the instrument, waited for the head to settle, topped it up, re-inserted the plunger, handed it back, clicked his heels and bobbed his head. With a grin, John scribbled across his notebook: 'Now that's what I call a matre d' !' </p> <p>You came to forget, as his lightning fingers flashed across the page, that there was anything unusual in a man writing his side of the conversation on paper. Frustrating though he found it, not being able to chip in out loud like everyone else, he was tickled by the idea of written chat, half the dialogue recorded always for posterity. Hungover after a party, he would flick back through the notebook and mutter: 'Did I really say that to him ?' or, more thoughtfully: 'Why on earth do I have here, \"My parents bought him an alabaster hunchback in 1968\"?' </p> <p>It was risky though, because John loved gossip, was sought by every social circle going, and always knew the latest scandals; tabloid editors would kill to get their hands on those notebooks. </p> <p>This wasn't a public front; he was equally merry at home. Due in large part to the inspiring temperament and determination of his wonderful wife, Nigella Lawson, John's house was always full of people: laughing, chatting, frequently drunk, relishing the opulent meals which her magic hands could rustle up last-minute when she'd been expecting three people and 20 had turned up. </p> <p>I haven't been in many homes of the terminally ill, but it must be rare to find one so glowingly warm and happy, buzzing with fun and games, with children skipping about in fancy dress, grown-ups betting on Scrabble. Every day felt like Christmas Day; it was somewhere you always wanted to be. The title of Nigella's book, How to Be a Domestic Goddess, was an ironic one, but, John said: 'It isn't ironic to me.' </p> <p>He never lost interest in other people, however trivial our traumas seemed compared to his. Even as he lay in a lead-lined room last autumn, blasted for a solid week with radiation so strong that no visitor was allowed to stay longer than 15 minutes, he wanted to spend those 15 minutes hearing about your problems. He managed to blend an incredible amount of kindness and love for his friends with a staggering forthrightness towards those he didn't like. With months to live, John wasn't going to waste any time; if he thought someone was a bad man, he'd tell them straight. And 'bad man' is not the phrase he'd use. People who had mistreated his friends, or voiced an inexcusable opinion, would look down at that notebook and blanch. Social cowards among us looked on, and wished we dared do the same. </p> <p>But John had no interest in becoming an oracle, or claiming some profound world vision as he walked through that valley. When he started writing about his cancer in the Times, the subject matter was ghastly but the style still the same old John - sparkling, witty, mischievous, unsaintly, just as he was in real life. He didn't embrace religion in his illness, only superstition ('I describe myself as a Jewish agnostic,' he said. 'I would say \"atheist\" but what would God think?') and he didn't scuttle to the spurious comfort of new-age 'alternative' remedies either. </p> <p>In fact, this became a fervent cause of his - to defend the traditional, qualified medics he admired at the Royal Marsden, and wave the banner against quacks, cranks and magic potions sprinkled at midnight. He was assailed by angry post from people 'enclosing the oil of the Kovali tree, and books called Why Your Doctor Hates You And Wants You To Die . This was only grist to the mill, of course. He once stumbled across another John Diamond, who writes books recommending alternative treatments for cancer. John said: 'It's a bit like Ann Widdecombe discovering she shares her name with a kissogram girl in Widnes.' </p> <p>Neither was there time to be precious. John shrugged off the accusations of those who considered his cancer confessionals inappropriate; he ignored the petty newspaper attacks written by meretricious, small-minded hacks who, instead of being inspired by John's powerful, brilliant journalism, continued to voice any half-baked opinion for a fee. Was this because he knew their bitchy witterings were in tomorrow's cat-litter tray, while his astonishing journalistic achievement would be remembered for ever? No, actually, it wasn't. </p> <p>It is true that he received thousands of letters from cancer patients and their families, paying tribute to the comfort and joy they took from his writing. It is true that nobody had ever written with such frank wit, style, grace and insight on an illness which touches us all in one way or another. It is true that his words helped dismantle the taboos around cancer; persuaded people not to fear open discussion; persuaded doctors not to be mealy-mouthed and dainty with patients. But you wouldn't hear that from John, who said, modestly, that he wrote about cancer because it made life easier for him , that he was amazed and grateful for the outlet. 'The only reason I write about it,' he once said, 'is because I can.' </p> <p>So his ability to dismiss the naysayers was nothing to do with smugness, merited though that would have been. He just had bigger things to think about. When Robert Katz and I adapted his work for the stage, John watched his life unfold in front of him and said only: 'Yep. I like it. But that guitar... it should really be a banjo.' </p> <p>We were in the middle of readapting the play for the BBC, and John was going to be in it. His was, of course, a non-speaking role. John was excited; he used to teach drama before he became a journalist, loved performance of any kind, and always wanted to act. He said he wanted us to go ahead with the project if he died, so I suppose we will, but it won't be half as good without John. Then again, nothing will be. </p> <p> They were strangely carefree, cancerous days. Confident that he'd provided sufficiently for his adored family, John merrily gambled the rest on blackjack, took his beautiful wife and children on a succession of holidays, and celebrated his frightening weight loss with a wardrobe of fresh designer suits in his new size. He got a tattoo and bleached his hair. When the illness was first confirmed, he bought himself another Harley-Davidson. Blushing as he confessed to Nigella, he observed: 'What was she going to say? That I'd kill myself on it?' When the cancer returned for the last time, he upgraded to a Roller. </p> <p>I introduced him to a casino, a fairly low-rent basement joint, certainly not one of those top-drawer Mayfair places, but John wasn't fussy. My God, those other gamblers (gloomy addicts in trouble and cheap tweed) would stare when Diamond came in, usually with two or three glamorous blonde friends and a TV star or two, to chuckle over a game of casino stud. Nigella was indulgent about John's daffy hobby, happily leaving him to it; but occasionally she too came along, looking just like Claudia Cardinale in black velvet trousers. John gazed proudly across as she placed her bets, and for a moment you'd swear you were in a beautiful black-and-white 1950s film, not a smoke-filled, garishly-carpeted West London basement full of slot-machines. </p> <p>But terminal illness, like his favourite vodka and water, doesn't alter the sufferer's character, only exaggerates his essence. In cancer veritas, John was never going to be a cautious man. Life was about indulgence, not denial, and he was damned if his (or his family's) fun was going to be compromised by that stupid illness. </p> <p>And it wasn't. He derived an intense happiness just from watching his children splash in a paddling pool, or trying a new school uniform, or just from looking at Nigella across a room. He told me once that, after 10 years together, he still felt a secret thrill that he was allowed to go home with her. </p> <p>And cancer or not, his presence was always a delight, his tangible air of recklessness and mischief made everything sparkle. I used to feel a physical surge of pleasure, when I walked into a party and saw that midnight-blue, crushed-velvet Katherine Hamnett suit and blond crop shining under the light; that always meant it was going to be a great evening. Everyone felt the same: he was loved beyond description. </p> <p>Of course he was angry sometimes, and scared, and unhappy. When he learned, in January 1999, that the cancer was going to prove terminal, he wrote: 'I thought I'd be terrified when I got this news, but what I feel most of all is sad.' He was sad for himself and sad, above all, for the darling family with whom he was so desperate to remain. </p> <p>But with the help of Nigella, Cosima and Bruno, he had a quite incredible capacity for finding joy along the way. When you looked at him, you didn't see sadness - you saw colour and light, dazzle and spirit, charm and laughter. He just shone . When John walked into a room it was like Pleasantville; the monochrome would give way to a ripple of blues and greens, pinks and golds. Without him, it's just grey. </p> <p>Now I keep thinking of that bit from Tennyson: </p> <p> He is not here; but far away<br>The noise of life begins again,<br>And ghastly through the drizzling rain <br>On the bald street breaks the blank day. </p> <p> And John would say: 'The piece is fine, Toria.

      "bodyText": "Of all the ironies surrounding John Diamond's throat cancer (the broadcaster who lost his voice; the brilliant cook's husband who couldn't eat), perhaps the greatest was that, although usually the only person in the room with a terminal illness, he always seemed the most alive. You always saw him first in a crowd, his blaze of blond hair and dandy suits picking him out like a lighthouse in fog; a cluster of people roaring with laughter as John scribbled jokes and observations on a pocket pad faster and more engagingly than anyone else could speak. He laughed a lot, for a dying man: he laughed a lot for any man. He moved in a crackle of energy and wit. If you or I could take only liquids, through a syringe into a stomach tube, we would huddle self-pityingly at home. For John, the only question was how to get champagne down the tube without losing the fizz? At one party, he was approached by a matre d' who took the syringe, gently decanted champagne into the body of the instrument, waited for the head to settle, topped it up, re-inserted the plunger, handed it back, clicked his heels and bobbed his head. With a grin, John scribbled across his notebook: 'Now that's what I call a matre d' !' You came to forget, as his lightning fingers flashed across the page, that there was anything unusual in a man writing his side of the conversation on paper. Frustrating though he found it, not being able to chip in out loud like everyone else, he was tickled by the idea of written chat, half the dialogue recorded always for posterity. Hungover after a party, he would flick back through the notebook and mutter: 'Did I really say that to him ?' or, more thoughtfully: 'Why on earth do I have here, \"My parents bought him an alabaster hunchback in 1968\"?' It was risky though, because John loved gossip, was sought by every social circle going, and always knew the latest scandals; tabloid editors would kill to get their hands on those notebooks. This wasn't a public front; he was equally merry at home. Due in large part to the inspiring temperament and determination of his wonderful wife, Nigella Lawson, John's house was always full of people: laughing, chatting, frequently drunk, relishing the opulent meals which her magic hands could rustle up last-minute when she'd been expecting three people and 20 had turned up.

She decrees: 'Religious art is religious before it is art' and earnestly defends Catholic kitsch ofbleeding hearts and relics. </p> <p>Her polite refusal to prioritise between the information she unearths makes this book unexpectedly wearisome. Only in the closing pages, when the glimpses of Agnes coalesce into argument, does she take issue with the Church and its veneration of the virgin martyr, its insistence that she died intacta, as if assault in the brothel would have polluted her sainthood. I won't wander through a church in the same way again, but with a stronger sense of faithless exclusion. Visser leaves no gap in the mosaic for detached curiosity.</p>",

Her polite refusal to prioritise between the information she unearths makes this book unexpectedly wearisome. Only in the closing pages, when the glimpses of Agnes coalesce into argument, does she take issue with the Church and its veneration of the virgin martyr, its insistence that she died intacta, as if assault in the brothel would have polluted her sainthood. I won't wander through a church in the same way again, but with a stronger sense of faithless exclusion. Visser leaves no gap in the mosaic for detached curiosity.",

'They've pissed everyone off.' </p> <p>The bidder, representing some of the most powerful construction companies in the world, was fuming at the latest Government proposals to rescue the clapped-out Tube. 'When we saw it we thought it was a spoof. They haven't involved us in the process. It's unworkable. It's unbankable.' </p> <p>Early in February, Bob Kiley, Mayor Ken Livingstone's transport chief for London, had supposedly been given a free run at remodelling the Government's controversial mechanism for modernising the Tube. That was until last Sunday, when he delivered a damning critique of the public-private partnership and suggested a simple alternative, a coherent management structure with a single point of responsibility. </p> <p>Last Wednesday the Government sought to break the deadlock by unveiling its first serious modification to its treasured public private partnership - to univeral condemnation. A leaked briefing note from the Mayor's office said that 'the Government side has not understood the key issues at stake'. </p> <p>Essentially the Government's 17 modifications stretch PPP to the limit. They allow Kiley to remove or veto the appointment of any chief executive of a private construction company contracted to run one of three bundles of Tube lines. They give Transport for London, the body that oversees all London's transport, which Kiley heads, the right to timetable improvements and remove key private sector managers if they are thought not up to the job. </p> <p>The consortiums were in uproar. 'It impinges on our rights of ownership,' said one. </p> <p>Many observers believe that Kiley and Livingstone should be beside themselves with joy at the major concessions they have won. But as the Mayor's briefing note says: 'It is not that the government proposals do not go far enough, but that they go down the wrong road'. What Kiley and Livingstone want is unified management control. </p> <p>Kiley defines this as 'operations, maintenance and invesment priorities established by London Underground, and not three separate Infracos' (private sector consortiums responsible for track, signalling and tunnels). It is the pair's frustration at lack of progress on this point that has forced them to the brink of legal action against the Government. A preliminary hearing is expected within three weeks and a judicial review would last about 90 days, further delaying the PPP process. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Tube's biggest union, the RMT, is expected this Friday to confirm that it will be holding a series of one-day strikes, crippling the South-east's transport network up until May. </p> <p>It had all seemed so simple a month ago. Then, in a ground-breaking agreement, Prescott appeared to give Kiley, considered to be one of the world's leading urban transport experts, the green light to resolve the impasse surrounding the Government's plans for the semi-privatisation of the woeful Tube system. </p> <p>But on 12 February, a meeting between Kiley and top Treasury mandarin Shriti Vadera pulled the carpet from under Kiley. Under no circumstances would she sanction public control of the Tube. Any solution would have to be under the framework of the PPP. Just who would be responsible for safety, maintenance and timetabling massive upgrades was unclear. </p> <p>'The only people rubbing their hands at this would be lawyers, accountants and management consultants,' said a senior Transport for London source. 'And they've never run a Tube system in their lives.' </p> <p>Kiley this weekend formally rejected the Government's proposals. And Livingstone raised the ante. 'Bob Kiley is talking to some of the best transport operators in the world,' he said. 'They will not come to London if they are unable to manage the system in a unified fashion.' </p> <p>Of course, there are ownership principles at stake here, plus billions of pounds and the welfare of 3 million passengers a day. </p> <p>But the future of the Tube has always been something of a political football, and the issue is more deeply mired in politics now than it has ever been.

      "bodyText": "'The Government has done the impossible,' said an exasperated leader of one of the private consortiums bidding to run London's Underground this weekend. 'They've pissed everyone off.' The bidder, representing some of the most powerful construction companies in the world, was fuming at the latest Government proposals to rescue the clapped-out Tube. 'When we saw it we thought it was a spoof. They haven't involved us in the process. It's unworkable. It's unbankable.'

      "body": "<p>When Chancellors make Budget announcements, drinkers, smokers and drivers generally make the front pages. The effect of technical adjustments to taxes and benefits tend to merit mention in the small print of learned journals, if at all. </p> <p>Gordon Brown is accused of being a Chancellor at a loose end after putting macroeconomics on autopilot, and of filling his time by tinkering with details which only serve to make people more and more confused by the tax system. </p> <p>But the impact on some families of the Chancellor's measures has been marked - even if it has not been noticed by those higher up the income scale. </p> <p>To shed light on the effects of his changes on the families, The Observer commissioned Holly Sutherland, senior research officer at Cambridge University's department of applied economics, to run a series of test cases through the computer model used by her microsimulation unit. The results appear below. </p> <p>Four hypothetical examples were chosen, reflecting people with different incomes, marital status, numbers of children and whether they owned their homes. </p> <p>In each case, Sutherland fed in a range of incomes, with no family member working, or with one in work.</p> <p><strong> The poorer family</strong><br> </p> <p> Family one is at the bottom of the income scale. In case A there is no one in paid work, putting it in the bottom tenth of the population in terms of income. With two children, aged nine and 12, increases in Income Support and Child Benefit produce a rise in weekly income of \u00a320.80, or 10.2 per cent. With no one going out to work, there is no benefit from the Working Families' Tax Credit. </p> <p>In case B the same family has one member working full-time on the minimum wage, putting the family in the second tenth of the income scale. </p> <p>A higher initial income of \u00a3233.43 has increased by \u00a323.57, or 10 per cent. Reductions in national insurance and increases in child benefit are part of the rise. WFTC also comes into play, but this is offset by reductions in housing benefit and council tax benefit. </p> <p><strong> The lone parent</strong><br> </p> <p> The abolition of lone-parent benefits was considered a misjudgment by the Chancellor. But outright abolition affects only those who have become lone parents since the measure was introduced. In Family Two, the parent was single then so the entitlement has been reduced, not ended. </p> <p>In case A the parent is not in work, and the family falls into the third tenth of the wealth scale. Income increased by \u00a312.10 from \u00a3138.30, or 8.7 per cent. In case B, the family is halfway up the scale because of single status with the parent working 38 hours on minimum wage. Income rises \u00a319.92, or 9.9 per cent, from \u00a3201.04. This is thanks to WFTC, offset by a housing benefit cut. Lower NI and income tax help. </p> <p><strong> The childless homeowners</strong><br> </p> <p> Family three, an owner-occupier household, has no children. It has therefore suffered in two ways: the end of mortgage interest tax relief and the end of Married Couple's Allowance (MCA), to be replaced by the Children's Tax Credit, available only to parents. </p> <p>In case A, with no one in paid work, there is no change to income: raised benefits have been aimed at those with children. Case B, where one of the couple works, is in the lowest tenth of incomes, below the family with no one in work. Case A has its mortgage interest payments covered by income support, but this disappears when work is found, as in case B. This is the 'unemployment trap', which obstructs Brown's efforts to encourage people into work, and an argument for a higher minimum wage. </p> <p>Case B sees income fall \u00a35.72 a week, or 4 per cent, from \u00a3141.08. Lost mortgage tax relief and MCA is offset by cuts in income tax rates. In case C, half-way up the income scale, \u00a34.68 (1.7 per cent) is lost from \u00a3275.23 a week, due again to lost mortgage relief and MCA, but the fall is broken by lower income tax. </p> <p><strong> The family with children</strong><br> </p> <p> Family four has most children, and stands to gain most from the measures targeted at the young.

      "bodyText": "When Chancellors make Budget announcements, drinkers, smokers and drivers generally make the front pages. The effect of technical adjustments to taxes and benefits tend to merit mention in the small print of learned journals, if at all. Gordon Brown is accused of being a Chancellor at a loose end after putting macroeconomics on autopilot, and of filling his time by tinkering with details which only serve to make people more and more confused by the tax system. But the impact on some families of the Chancellor's measures has been marked - even if it has not been noticed by those higher up the income scale. To shed light on the effects of his changes on the families, The Observer commissioned Holly Sutherland, senior research officer at Cambridge University's department of applied economics, to run a series of test cases through the computer model used by her microsimulation unit. The results appear below. Four hypothetical examples were chosen, reflecting people with different incomes, marital status, numbers of children and whether they owned their homes. In each case, Sutherland fed in a range of incomes, with no family member working, or with one in work. The poorer family Family one is at the bottom of the income scale. In case A there is no one in paid work, putting it in the bottom tenth of the population in terms of income. With two children, aged nine and 12, increases in Income Support and Child Benefit produce a rise in weekly income of \u00a320.80, or 10.2 per cent. With no one going out to work, there is no benefit from the Working Families' Tax Credit. In case B the same family has one member working full-time on the minimum wage, putting the family in the second tenth of the income scale. A higher initial income of \u00a3233.43 has increased by \u00a323.57, or 10 per cent. Reductions in national insurance and increases in child benefit are part of the rise. WFTC also comes into play, but this is offset by reductions in housing benefit and council tax benefit. The lone parent The abolition of lone-parent benefits was considered a misjudgment by the Chancellor. But outright abolition affects only those who have become lone parents since the measure was introduced. In Family Two, the parent was single then so the entitlement has been reduced, not ended. In case A the parent is not in work, and the family falls into the third tenth of the wealth scale. Income increased by \u00a312.10 from \u00a3138.30, or 8.7 per cent. In case B, the family is halfway up the scale because of single status with the parent working 38 hours on minimum wage. Income rises \u00a319.92, or 9.9 per cent, from \u00a3201.04. This is thanks to WFTC, offset by a housing benefit cut. Lower NI and income tax help. The childless homeowners Family three, an owner-occupier household, has no children. It has therefore suffered in two ways: the end of mortgage interest tax relief and the end of Married Couple's Allowance (MCA), to be replaced by the Children's Tax Credit, available only to parents. In case A, with no one in paid work, there is no change to income: raised benefits have been aimed at those with children. Case B, where one of the couple works, is in the lowest tenth of incomes, below the family with no one in work. Case A has its mortgage interest payments covered by income support, but this disappears when work is found, as in case B. This is the 'unemployment trap', which obstructs Brown's efforts to encourage people into work, and an argument for a higher minimum wage. Case B sees income fall \u00a35.72 a week, or 4 per cent, from \u00a3141.08. Lost mortgage tax relief and MCA is offset by cuts in income tax rates. In case C, half-way up the income scale, \u00a34.68 (1.7 per cent) is lost from \u00a3275.23 a week, due again to lost mortgage relief and MCA, but the fall is broken by lower income tax. The family with children Family four has most children, and stands to gain most from the measures targeted at the young. However, the effects depend on income. In case A, with one full-time employee on the minimum wage, the increase is \u00a39.10, or 3.2 per cent on income of \u00a3284.01. The extra is from a small WFTC increase offset by a council tax benefit reduction, an increase in child benefit and an NI cut, offset by lost mortgage tax relief. Case B, with one employee on \u00a318,000 a year, sees the largest increase for this family type: \u00a331.99 (9.8 per cent) on \u00a3325.83 of income. This comes from the effects of the WFTC, increases in child benefit and a fall in NI payments. In case C, the net effect of a small NI increase, a tax reduction and a child benefit increase delivers \u00a34.94 more income, or 1 per cent of the \u00a3461.27 a week it earned. For case D, the richest family in the exercise, factors like those in case C deliver a 0.7 per cent rise on a weekly income of \u00a3820.35.

      "body": "<p>The applause as Gordon Brown made his entry to the Treasury in May 1997 may have reflected the hope in a demoralised department that things could only get better. </p> <p>But to the world outside, he presented a conundrum. Brown had spent months in the City arguing that Labour could be trusted with the economy. But he had also signalled some redistribution - such as welfare-to-work schemes funded by a \u00a35 billion windfall tax on utilities. </p> <p>Nearly four years on, with an election looming, the answer to the question 'Gordon Brown - Iron Chancellor or social democrat?' is a little clearer. Peter Robinson of the Institute for Public Policy Research says: 'All Labour chancellors have to balance the need to appear competent on the economy with their desire for social principles - adequate funding for public services, better benefits for pensioners and families. In that sense he is typical.' </p> <p>But Brown's tenure is unusual in that while other Labour Chancellors had the same instincts, few had the macroeconomic background against which to perform this delicate balancing act. Brown has. For eight years the economy has grown, and unemployment has fallen. </p> <p>Apart from enhanced credibility, the key consequence is room for manoeuvre, evidenced by consistent Budget surpluses - this year's is estimated at a bigger-than-expected \u00a315.9 billion. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that Brown has \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn to play with in his pre-election Budget. </p> <p>This happy state of affairs is due firstly to increased tax receipts - by 2000-1 they are estimated to be \u00a324bn higher than the Conservatives predicted in their last Budget - garnered partly through growth and partly through tax increases early in the Parliament. </p> <p>But the other side of the equation was the use of tax receipts to pay off debt while sticking to Conservative spending plans for two years. In that time, spending was lower than under the Tory plans. </p> <p>It was this spending regime, combined with independent interest rate decisions, that gave Brown credibility. But keeping public spending low meant users of public services - typically the less well off - were disadvantaged. </p> <p>Robinson says Brown's balancing act was largely successful: 'He can - though he would never say this publicly - claim to be a strongly social democratic Chancellor.' But Robinson adds that Brown's social democratic reputation may have been tarnished by the following political misjudgments: </p> <p>\u0095 Abolishing the \u00a36.45-a-week lone-parent benefit </p> <p>\u0095 Introducing means-testing on some disability benefits </p> <p>\u0095 Increasing the state pension by only 75p a week (which culminated in a showdown with pensioners before it was substantially increased last autumn). </p> <p>Brown's reforms strongly favour low-income groups. A large proportion of the resources now finding their way into these households are the fruits of growth, but Carl Emmerson of the IFS points out: 'The tax burden on higher-income families has increased.' </p> <p>Brown stripped these families of perks such as tax relief on mortgages, on dividend income and on private health insurance, as well as introducing measures such as insurance premium tax and, until the last Budget, an increased fuel duty escalator. </p> <p>Meanwhile, business - assiduously courted with share option tax relief, research and development credits and reduced corporation tax - faced net bills thanks to the abolition of dividend tax credits and the bringing forward of corporation tax payments. The IFS calculates the cost to business of these measures at \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn. A package of fairness- at-work measures, including a minimum wage, also altered the balance in favour of lower-income Labour supporters. Despite this, Brown maintained his reputation for economic soundness . </p> <p>The distributional effects of Brown's work target most strongly those in poverty, particularly children. His flagship measure has been the Working Family Tax Credit, which replaced, and is more generous than, Family Credit, giving adults \u00a32.50 more a week, and young children \u00a312.65. </p> <p>Brown has also increased Child Benefit by 29 per cent for first children, and by 5 per cent for subsequent ones. Alongside this, Income Support for youngest children was increased by 72 per cent over previous inflation-indexed Conservative upgrades. And finally, a Children's Tax Credit, giving a discount of \u00a38.50 a week, again targets less well-off families over wealthier ones, but not the very poorest. </p> <p>Academics Holly Sutherland and David Piachaud calculate that Brown's measures have led to an increase in household incomes for the lowest three income deciles of 12.3 per cent, 13.9 per cent and 10.8 per cent respectively, while the top three gained 1.4 per cent, 1 per cent and 0.3 per cent. They find that the number of children in poverty has fallen by 35.5 per cent. The average shortfall of income beneath the poverty line for poor children has also fallen by 31.7 per cent. </p> <p>Sutherland says: 'These measures have achieved a lot in terms of reducing child poverty, but to abolish it within a generation, which is the Government's aim, they need to do more.' </p> <p>Following the 75p pension debacle, Brown used the means-tested Minimum Income Guarantee to deliver a substantial increase in income to the poorest pensioners. However, as Brown admits, there is still much that needs sorting out. </p> <p>But there are two groups less affected by his largesse - non-working low- income families and those without children. The IFS indicates that, as part of a possible \u00a31.2bn package for children, Brown could increase child allowances in income support and the children element of the WFTC to tackle the first of these issues - or concentrate resources on those without children. </p> <p>But most believe the real Brown will not emerge until after the election. Some of his ambitions have been well flagged. One is an Integrated Child Credit, bundling the children's elements of current benefits and credits. The IFS says this could channel further resources to the least well-off, because income support payments would be increased. </p> <p>Another is the Pension Credit, which, along with above-inflation increases in the basic pension and MIG, would increase the incomes of pensioners by some \u00a34bn. A third is the employment tax credit, which would extend the WFTC to families without children. </p> <p>Much of Brown's welfare-to-work and New Deal agenda has been built on a strong labour market, and he is keen to be remembered as the man who restored full employment. Robinson believes he needs to introduce a target of 80 per cent of the working age population in work. The figure is currently less than 75 per cent. On top of this, he believes correcting the UK's regional imbalance is vital. </p> <p>Unemployment and output rates vary widely between the depressed North East and the prosperous South East. One option would be to increase the \u00a3120m regional selective assistance budget, channelled into businesses in struggling areas.

      "bodyText": "The applause as Gordon Brown made his entry to the Treasury in May 1997 may have reflected the hope in a demoralised department that things could only get better. But to the world outside, he presented a conundrum. Brown had spent months in the City arguing that Labour could be trusted with the economy. But he had also signalled some redistribution - such as welfare-to-work schemes funded by a \u00a35 billion windfall tax on utilities. Nearly four years on, with an election looming, the answer to the question 'Gordon Brown - Iron Chancellor or social democrat?' is a little clearer. Peter Robinson of the Institute for Public Policy Research says: 'All Labour chancellors have to balance the need to appear competent on the economy with their desire for social principles - adequate funding for public services, better benefits for pensioners and families. In that sense he is typical.' But Brown's tenure is unusual in that while other Labour Chancellors had the same instincts, few had the macroeconomic background against which to perform this delicate balancing act. Brown has. For eight years the economy has grown, and unemployment has fallen. Apart from enhanced credibility, the key consequence is room for manoeuvre, evidenced by consistent Budget surpluses - this year's is estimated at a bigger-than-expected \u00a315.9 billion. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that Brown has \u00a33bn-\u00a34bn to play with in his pre-election Budget. This happy state of affairs is due firstly to increased tax receipts - by 2000-1 they are estimated to be \u00a324bn higher than the Conservatives predicted in their last Budget - garnered partly through growth and partly through tax increases early in the Parliament. But the other side of the equation was the use of tax receipts to pay off debt while sticking to Conservative spending plans for two years. In that time, spending was lower than under the Tory plans.

Money up front, of course: $100 for four 'hits' of crack, $10 for the runner and $10 for himself. The runner is Everton, in whose drive we park. He gets out to complete the final phase across 36th, to an undisclosed address, and returns 20 minutes later with the gear.</p> <p>That affords time for a chat with Everton's girl, Katie - white, serially tattooed, horribly thin with punctured arms. She came from Athens, Georgia, and has been 'working' Miami's Overtown for three years, living with Everton and financing her habit at a discount.</p> <p>Apparently sharing their home is Calvin, aged about 50, who has been 'blowin' rocks' for five years now and is alive but a tad jittery. 'Have to watch this stuff,' he counsels. 'You come off it fast and gotta eat. When the money's gone, and maybe on a weekend.'</p> <p>Once loaded up, Johnny navigates a way back to Decadence-sur-Mer - the hinterland of clubs hidden behind the glitz of Ocean Drive. There, he and hundreds like him will connect with thousands of customers pouring into this crossroads between the Americas - under the watchful but ultimately defeated eye of the authorities. Now, however, the orthodoxy of 30 years that has seen America lead the world in the 'war on drugs' is itself under scrutiny. The iron heel of 'zero tolerance' drew America into distant wars, criminalised two generations of black youth and incarcerated hundreds of thousands of people. A combination of the 'war on drugs' and turf wars between dealers dominates crime in America.</p> <p>No one would have thought the election of a Republican President could bring with it the signs of a sea change. But, as the movie Traffic heads for Oscar glory, so the advent of George W Bush, a former heavy drinker and rumoured drug user, also heralds a more cunning approach and a remarkable rebellion within his own party. This is partly because the iron heel has not worked, partly because it is too expensive and partly because treatment of drug users and addicts is a better - as well as cheaper - cure than imprisonment.</p> <p>Addiction to drugs in America is down on the all-time high of 20 years ago, but the drop is in marijuana and soft drugs, while the number using heroin is higher than ever - more than three million recorded, and cocaine still above two million recorded. The new heroin capitals are New Jersey, California and Deep-South Georgia. Of America's two million prisoners, between 60 and 70 per cent test positive for substance abuse (including alcohol) when arrested, and the proportion of offences that are drug-related offences varies from state to state between 18 and 27 per cent.</p> <p>The cost of drug addiction, smoking and alcohol abuse to American society has been estimated by the Centre on Addiction and Substance Abuse at $300 billion a year, while the amounts spent on treatment and prevention are a small percentage of federal and state drug-related budgets. The federal drug-control budget is $18.4bn, of which half goes on domestic law enforcement and only $3.6bn on treatment.</p> <p>The morning after the Overtown drug deal, in the federal building downtown, even an official with the Drug Enforcement Administration, a veteran Mafia-buster, admits the flood of cocaine and its derivatives from Colombia and other nations has increased 'beyond realistic control'. There is, he says, 'only a degree where the dope business can be policed... down there where those mothers grow the stuff and on the streets around here. The lid can't be held on this thing. It needs a cut in demand so that the supply side eases up on its own accord'.</p> <p>On the same day, up in Washington, the State of the Union address was preceded by an even more pressing appointment for President Bush - his third summit meeting with a head of state in 10 days, and the most important: with President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana of Colombia.</p> <p>Top of their agenda was Plan Colombia, the largest aid single package - some $2 million a day - ever dispatched by the US, authorised by the Clinton administration last year to a nation which thereby claimed its place as the third biggest recipient of US generosity after Israel and Egypt. The package has so many complicated strings attached that it has been assailed from left and right: the Left sees it as aid to a weak government that mutates into covert backing to right-wing death squads, and last Monday even Bush's State Department lambasted Pastrana's government for its record on human rights. A parsimonious Capitol Hill sees the package as throwing good money after bad.</p> <p>But the most cogent argument has come from Colombia's neighbours, frayed at the frontiers by raging drug wars. They say the world's biggest consumer of drugs should attack the problem at home in different and more effective ways than the cumbersome iron heel that may have brought about a relatively peaceful period in America's drug history, but has failed to put an end to the narcotics epidemic. This was the message Bush and his aides brought from his meeting with Pastrana: that there is an imminent sea change in US tactics in the war on drugs - a shift towards a more considered strategy.</p> <p>Of all the appointments to Bush's cabinet, one is striking by its omission to date: there is still no replacement for Bill Clinton's 'drug tsar', Bill McCaffrey. White House officials told The Observer last week that Bush has a choice in mind: Colonel James McDonah. The colonel's brief, however, will be what aides like to call 'demand-side reduction' rather than war in Colombia. This is propelled in part by the latest thinking on how best to confront the drug problem, and in part because the cost of incarcerating addicts is higher than that of treating them.</p> <p>The irony is that the iron heel, zero-tolerance policy was that of Bill Clinton, who claims never to have inhaled but was the hallmark of the sax-playing, baby-booming, draft-dodging Sixties generation. And the smoke signals of a turn away from such a policy are being sent from a White House inhabited by the heir to the Bush dynasty and former governor of the execution state of Texas. Yet he is also a man who admits his own alcoholism and never denied reports that a hefty proportion of the allowances he was paid as a spoiled student allegedly went up his nose.</p> <p>As the New York Times reminded its readership this week, the President understands addiction better than most of the learned preachers on the subject. He said on CNN that he regarded alcohol and drug addiction as 'an illness', adding: 'We haven't done a very good job thus far of curing people of that illness.' Bush may be a conservative, but this is the new, not the old, language. The New York Times added that this is the America which will probably cheer Traffic to numerous Oscars later this month, and which demands a more creative approach to its most urgent social problem.</p> <p>Some of those around Bush don't show signs of a departure from the status quo - new Attorney-General John Ash-croft even opposes needle exchanges, common in Europe - but elsewhere within Bush's own Republican Party there is an appetite for change. This began with the governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson, emerging from the debate over candidate Bush's cocaine use to say he too had snorted in his time and, moreover, believed both his state and America should consider alternative means to prison in dealing with the drug problem. He urged decriminalisation of possession of drugs, and possibly even legalisation, which could lead to sale for profit. Most surprisingly, the governor's popularity was undented by the confession. His plan, announced last month, to present a Bill packaging his recommendations to the Capitol in Albuquerque stands little chance of success, but he has enacted and funded a 'harm-reduction' programme using Narcan, an easy-to-inject alternative to heroin.</p> <p>A more remarkable sea-change has came from one of the most senior Republican figures, New York state's governor, George Pataki - Bush's henchman in the state and on his short list for vice-president. Pataki has laid before the New York legislature his plan to rip up the Rockefeller Code - draconian laws passed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1973.</p> <p>Rockefeller passed his laws to order mandatory jail sentences of between 15 years and life for the more serious drug offences and lesser prison terms for non-violent drug-related crimes. Pataki's Bill, which stands a good chance of success, proposes to cut the 15 years to eight-and-a-half years and recommends treatment rather than prison for a host of non-violent drug-related offences.</p> <p>The Bill would not only affect future cases but convicts currently serving time for non-violent offences, making some 500 out of 600 of those in for more than 15 years eligible for release. Pataki says his plan 'builds on the experience and reflects an understanding of the experiences we have had since the Rockefeller laws were enacted'.</p> <p>That experience has seen the Democratic state of California pass a prototype for Pataki's law in the form of Proposition 36 - a referendum vote offering treatment options rather than jail for non-violent offenders. It has also seen the judicial system pay greater heed to scientific, social and fiscal research. The rise of 'drug-courts', allowing judges to impose substance-abuse treatment in place of jail sentences, has accompanied medical research into controlling the 'hedonic regions' of the brain.</p> <p>The Centre on Addiction and Substance Abuse published a report last week saying that states spend an average of 13 per cent of their total budgets 'shovelling up' the 'wreckage' of substance abuse - more than they appropriate for higher education and 100 times what they spend on prevention and treatment. In another study the Rand Corporation calculated that every dollar spent on drug treatment saved $7 in services.</p> <p>Bush has put drug treatment high on the list of priorities for what he calls 'faith-based initiatives' - the infrastructure of voluntary and church services which he envisages as agents of social reform. But the languages of commerce and charity often make for a bad mix. Back in Miami, some of the victims of the Overtown drug trade also suffered a different fate at the apparently model Sea Winds drug rehabilitation centre. The authorities recently found the centre was operating without a Florida state detoxification license, and was breaking medication law. Affidavits were filed by some of its partners against another, one Mohammed Ibrahim, alleging that medication law was broken, and Ibrahim has himself pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of 'grand theft'.</p> <p>So in Miami, while the Bush administration debates whether to use the term 'Drug War' or 'Drug Cancer', the courts continue to try those who deal the drugs, and at least one of those who claims to treat the wreckage they leave in their wake.</p>",

Top of their agenda was Plan Colombia, the largest aid single package - some $2 million a day - ever dispatched by the US, authorised by the Clinton administration last year to a nation which thereby claimed its place as the third biggest recipient of US generosity after Israel and Egypt. The package has so many complicated strings attached that it has been assailed from left and right: the Left sees it as aid to a weak government that mutates into covert backing to right-wing death squads, and last Monday even Bush's State Department lambasted Pastrana's government for its record on human rights. A parsimonious Capitol Hill sees the package as throwing good money after bad. But the most cogent argument has come from Colombia's neighbours, frayed at the frontiers by raging drug wars. They say the world's biggest consumer of drugs should attack the problem at home in different and more effective ways than the cumbersome iron heel that may have brought about a relatively peaceful period in America's drug history, but has failed to put an end to the narcotics epidemic. This was the message Bush and his aides brought from his meeting with Pastrana: that there is an imminent sea change in US tactics in the war on drugs - a shift towards a more considered strategy. Of all the appointments to Bush's cabinet, one is striking by its omission to date: there is still no replacement for Bill Clinton's 'drug tsar', Bill McCaffrey. White House officials told The Observer last week that Bush has a choice in mind: Colonel James McDonah. The colonel's brief, however, will be what aides like to call 'demand-side reduction' rather than war in Colombia. This is propelled in part by the latest thinking on how best to confront the drug problem, and in part because the cost of incarcerating addicts is higher than that of treating them. The irony is that the iron heel, zero-tolerance policy was that of Bill Clinton, who claims never to have inhaled but was the hallmark of the sax-playing, baby-booming, draft-dodging Sixties generation. And the smoke signals of a turn away from such a policy are being sent from a White House inhabited by the heir to the Bush dynasty and former governor of the execution state of Texas. Yet he is also a man who admits his own alcoholism and never denied reports that a hefty proportion of the allowances he was paid as a spoiled student allegedly went up his nose. As the New York Times reminded its readership this week, the President understands addiction better than most of the learned preachers on the subject. He said on CNN that he regarded alcohol and drug addiction as 'an illness', adding: 'We haven't done a very good job thus far of curing people of that illness.' Bush may be a conservative, but this is the new, not the old, language. The New York Times added that this is the America which will probably cheer Traffic to numerous Oscars later this month, and which demands a more creative approach to its most urgent social problem. Some of those around Bush don't show signs of a departure from the status quo - new Attorney-General John Ash-croft even opposes needle exchanges, common in Europe - but elsewhere within Bush's own Republican Party there is an appetite for change. This began with the governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson, emerging from the debate over candidate Bush's cocaine use to say he too had snorted in his time and, moreover, believed both his state and America should consider alternative means to prison in dealing with the drug problem. He urged decriminalisation of possession of drugs, and possibly even legalisation, which could lead to sale for profit. Most surprisingly, the governor's popularity was undented by the confession. His plan, announced last month, to present a Bill packaging his recommendations to the Capitol in Albuquerque stands little chance of success, but he has enacted and funded a 'harm-reduction' programme using Narcan, an easy-to-inject alternative to heroin. A more remarkable sea-change has came from one of the most senior Republican figures, New York state's governor, George Pataki - Bush's henchman in the state and on his short list for vice-president. Pataki has laid before the New York legislature his plan to rip up the Rockefeller Code - draconian laws passed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1973. Rockefeller passed his laws to order mandatory jail sentences of between 15 years and life for the more serious drug offences and lesser prison terms for non-violent drug-related crimes. Pataki's Bill, which stands a good chance of success, proposes to cut the 15 years to eight-and-a-half years and recommends treatment rather than prison for a host of non-violent drug-related offences. The Bill would not only affect future cases but convicts currently serving time for non-violent offences, making some 500 out of 600 of those in for more than 15 years eligible for release. Pataki says his plan 'builds on the experience and reflects an understanding of the experiences we have had since the Rockefeller laws were enacted'. That experience has seen the Democratic state of California pass a prototype for Pataki's law in the form of Proposition 36 - a referendum vote offering treatment options rather than jail for non-violent offenders. It has also seen the judicial system pay greater heed to scientific, social and fiscal research. The rise of 'drug-courts', allowing judges to impose substance-abuse treatment in place of jail sentences, has accompanied medical research into controlling the 'hedonic regions' of the brain. The Centre on Addiction and Substance Abuse published a report last week saying that states spend an average of 13 per cent of their total budgets 'shovelling up' the 'wreckage' of substance abuse - more than they appropriate for higher education and 100 times what they spend on prevention and treatment. In another study the Rand Corporation calculated that every dollar spent on drug treatment saved $7 in services. Bush has put drug treatment high on the list of priorities for what he calls 'faith-based initiatives' - the infrastructure of voluntary and church services which he envisages as agents of social reform. But the languages of commerce and charity often make for a bad mix. Back in Miami, some of the victims of the Overtown drug trade also suffered a different fate at the apparently model Sea Winds drug rehabilitation centre. The authorities recently found the centre was operating without a Florida state detoxification license, and was breaking medication law. Affidavits were filed by some of its partners against another, one Mohammed Ibrahim, alleging that medication law was broken, and Ibrahim has himself pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of 'grand theft'. So in Miami, while the Bush administration debates whether to use the term 'Drug War' or 'Drug Cancer', the courts continue to try those who deal the drugs, and at least one of those who claims to treat the wreckage they leave in their wake.",

      "body": "<p>It was Napoleon who wished for lucky generals, and every Prime Minister worth his salt should wish for lucky Chancellors. Tony Blair chose well. He has a lucky Chancellor - and Wednesday's Budget, with another judicious mix of spending increases and tax cuts, will cap Gordon Brown's four years of charmed fiscal stewardship. It's been a remarkable chancellorship and has transformed Labour's reputation for economic management. But luck sooner or later runs out - and even virtue has its costs. </p> <p>His luck has been the wider economic context. There has been no world recession; the fallout of the Asian financial crisis was contained - indeed, the world carried on growing, and inflation everywhere has been depressed. Against this benign background Brown's tax receipts have flowed and the British economy carried on performing well. </p> <p>But if that luck fell to him, he has gone on to make his own. Brown has played his economic management just as he planned in the long dark nights of opposition. The establishment of an independent Bank of England proved a masterstroke; its interest rate policy has been nearly faultless. Other Labour governments have spent in the first two years of a Parliament and endured the next three regretting it; Brown has made his spending increases and tax cuts so they kick in for the next election rather than reward the vote at the last one. He raised taxes by some \u00a317 billion in the first two years of his term, and spent less in the first three years than even Margaret Thatcher in her pomp. The result is a stunning fiscal position that Brown has continually underestimated. </p> <p>Carl Emmerson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calculates that Brown has beaten his own Budget forecasts for the public surplus or deficit in the following year by approaching an average 1 per cent of GDP - a bias any post-war Chancellor would envy. It's not that getting the forecast wrong is unusual; it is underestimating it for four consecutive years that is so untypical. The joke about prudence is wearing thin. Brown is so prudent that the financial markets do not believe his forecasts; they factor in a Brown underprediction. </p> <p>The most extraordinary year was in the spring of 1999 when he forecast he would borrow just \u00a33bn in the following financial year. In the event there was a cash surplus of over \u00a316bn, a swing of some \u00a319bn to the good that is close to a post-war record. The combination of low inflation and consistent repayment of National Debt - the best guess is that there will be another \u00a316bn surplus in the current financial year alongside the \u00a322bn of debt repayment financed by the mobile phone spectrum auction - has driven the interest rate on long-term British government debt to an astonishing 4.9 per cent, the lowest in the G7 except Japan and Germany. Britain is becoming the new Switzerland, with the lowest debt and inflation, and the largest budget surplus, in Europe. </p> <p>Yet still the IMF and the European Commission are not satisfied - in part because they worry that Brown's spending plans over the next three years will fritter away this strength, and in part because the IMF worries that the economy will buckle under the combined weight of private and public spending and reignite inflation - a warning it repeated last week. In particular, it worries that the build-up of capital investment will mean the Government may have to borrow to finance capital spending, a position that Brown explicitly permits in his definition of sound fiscal policy (the golden rule) but which offends the new conservative hawks in the US, who argue for permanent balanced budgets as part of their jihad against the state. </p> <p>The IMF is wrong. Its hyperconservatism takes no account of the powerful disinflationary forces worldwide alongside an emerging surfeit of global productive capacity; the chances of an open economy such as Britain's suffering from a surge in inflation in this context is negligible. The greater risk, given Britain's chronically stretched public services, and a pension structure dependent on high real interest rates, is not spending the cash. </p> <p>For, while part of Brown's success lies in the strength of the economy and his own crafted strategy, the rest is explained by the Treasury's inability to make sure that the great spending departments actually invest the cash they have been allocated. Brown will avoid mentioning the subject in his Budget speech, confident that the Conservatives are doctrinally unable to attack him, but the Government is presiding over a fiscal scandal. It is so inefficient that it has been unable to invest the money allocated to it, so that public investment has sunk to new lows. This is not what Brown intended, but the feebleness of the Opposition has prevented the collapse of public investment from becoming a hot political issue. Gordon is lucky in every sense. </p> <p>But perhaps too lucky. Because the Government has not decisively reversed the decay in the public infrastructure, and has underspent what it planned, absurdly it is finding itself criticised by the IMF and EU Commission for potentially loosening a fiscal stance that is much tighter than it ever wanted. The baseline against which the Government is being judged is just too good. If it had invested the near \u00a310bn that it should have done over the last two years, the result would have been a lower surplus - but still much better than the surplus it actually forecast back in the spring of 1999. Moreover, we would all have begun to see a tangible improvement in the public infrastructure, while the adverse consequences of demand being higher than it was in actuality would have been trivial. </p> <p>Nor is that all. There is much self-congratulation about how much better Britain has organised its pension system than its principal European competitors. We don't have a generous state pension scheme, as they have, and better still the majority of pensioners, present and future, have saved privately for their old age through their own or company pension schemes. As a result Britain has no impending fiscal crisis about how it is to pay for an ageing population living off generous state pensions. </p> <p>But there is no such thing as a free lunch. For 20 years private pensions have proved an excellent investment, with annual returns on equity investment averaging 15 per cent alongside high real interest rates; as a result pensioners have been able to buy rich annuities with their highly performing savings. But now the British national debt is falling to some 30 per cent of GDP, carrying long-term interest rates and annuities to new lows. The assumptions on which private pension plans are based are being shredded. </p> <p>Any pension scheme - private or occupational - that defines a final pension in terms of some relationship to the contributor's final salary is in crisis. Employers who offer these defined benefit schemes are facing breathtaking increases in their contribution rates and thus payroll costs in order to keep their pension funds solvent in this new universe of low annuity rates. Even if they launch a new pension scheme with less generous benefits they face maintaining the solvency of the old fund. Paradoxically, paying off the national debt and fiscal conservatism is proving a payroll tax - via lower annuity rates - on many employers as they raise their contribution rates to their pension fund. Fiscal virtue has unexpected costs; running budget surpluses as large as Brown's is becoming an economic distortion in its own right. </p> <p>To his credit Brown is fighting the conservatism of the IMF and EU, but even following his own rules will only allow him to 'give away' some \u00a33bn to \u00a34bn. This will be hailed by the City as prudent and by his own supporters, as long as it is crafted to direct money at Labour's core constituency, as a political masterstroke. The other reality - national debt too low and government spending departments chronically unable to raise investment - will be forgotten. But this is a lucky Chancellor. </p> <p>Other reports: <br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445997,00.html\">Family fortunes</a><br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446002,00.html\"&gt;Don't scare the horses in the City<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445996,00.html\"&gt;Giving credit where tax credit's due<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445995,00.html\"&gt;Now, will the real Gordon Brown please stand up?<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446003,00.html\"&gt;Gordon's tonic: the hot tips<br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446179,00.html\">Is Labour aiming at you?</a><br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446180,00.html\"&gt;More cash and time off for mothers<br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446178,00.html\">Mr Brown, Mr Balls and the elusive Mrs Mortgage</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Some people are usefully described by their enemies, who have cause to fear and despise them. The Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic and his hate-machine media call Carla del Ponte 'the new Gestapo'. The Cosa Nostra mobsters of Sicily who tried to blow up del Ponte in 1988 like to brand her ' La Puttana ' - 'the whore' - and one of the many banking executives into whose affairs she snooped as Attorney General of Switzerland defines her as 'an unguided missile'.</p> <p>Dominique Poncet, a fellow Swiss lawyer, worried that del Ponte's campaign against banking secrecy might drive foreign custom away from these gnomes of Zurich, described her colleague as 'not good for Switzerland'. But a friend, the assassinated anti-Mafia hero judge Giovanni Falcone, called his colleague 'the personification of stubbornness' and del Ponte in turn describes herself as simply: 'a chain smoker' and 'a prosecutor'.</p> <p>Carla del Ponte is currently chief prosecutor for two historic institutions that have become metaphors for our era - whether they stand or fall: the international tribunals on war crimes established at The Hague - trying those accused of crimes committed in former Yugoslavia - and at Arusha, trying defendants from the Rwandan genocide.</p> <p>The tribunal established during the maelstrom of the Bosnian war in 1994 was at first dismissed as an unarmed hunter unlikely to bag any big game. It took nearly two years to hear the first case and the defendant in the first genocide trial (in which, declaring an interest, I testified for the prosecution) died in custody of a massive heart attack. The diabolical triad of prize indictees - Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic - remain at liberty.</p> <p>But some epic events have occurred at The Hague of late, which bear the unmistakable hallmark of Carla del Ponte. Suddenly, the court has become a judicial bowling alley, defendants going down like skittles. The conviction was secured last week of its most senior defendant, the Bosnian Croat political commander Dario Kordic, for directing a series of horrific massacres of Muslims along the Lasva valley, and his aide-de-camp.</p> <p>But far more significant, last month came a piece of history in our lifetime. Three Bosnian Serbs from Foca were convicted in the first ever war crimes trial dealing exclusively with sexual offences - charges that seared the imagination of even the most hardened of lawyers or war reporters; the systematic mass rape and torture of captive women and young girls.</p> <p>Here was not only justice being done, but justice being played in a new, female key; painted in new, female colours that depicted rape as a tool of war and crime against humanity. If The Hague was conceived as proceeding in the traditions of Nuremberg, this was a crime of which the male world of those trials had not even attempted to convict the Nazis, for all the copious evidence available.</p> <p>The Foca verdict came on the slipstream of two civil suits against an absentee Radovan Kadadzic filed through New York by women who had been raped at the Omarska concentration camp, in which the juries asked the judge for permission to award up to 10 times the maximum damages allowed.</p> <p>Systematic rape was also a component part in the conviction for genocide of Jean-Paul Akayesu, a Hutu leader in the Rwanda genocide, at the Arusha court last year. But the central and sole conviction for mass rape in Foca ended once and for all grotesque doubts that some had sought to cast over the veracity of the accounts of women raped in Bosnia, which first surfaced in 1992. Others seemed to find it hard to deal with. The then UN envoy David Owen, when pressed in Sarajevo to draft a response, said: 'It's very difficult to talk to the Serbs about this kind of thing.'</p> <p>The investigation was made by a tenacious American female attorney, Nancy Patterson, and the verdict delivered by a female judge, Florence Mumba of Zambia. But it is impossible for the world not to associate the conviction with del Ponte and the success of the prosecution's case with the feminisation of The Hague tribunal.</p> <p>Carla del Ponte is third in a line of formidable women at The Hague - the others were the judge in the first case who became its president, Gabrielle Kirk MacDonald, a black civil rights judge from Texas; and judge Louise Arbour of Canada, whom del Ponte replaced in September 1999.</p> <p>Del Ponte was the first career prosecutor to step into the prosecutor's shoes. And what a prosecutor she was: a woman who, as she puts it herself, 'never served anyone or anything but the law', and a woman with enemies; a veteran of the war through the courts against the Cosa Nostra, the Russian Mafia, Swiss bank secrecy, Colombian drug cartels and more. She was the only figure in Swiss pubic life with a 24-hour personal armed guard.</p> <p>The first things you notice about Carla del Ponte are her height and the cigarettes. She is a powerhouse a little over five feet tall and lights one cigarette from the other. Oh to have been a fly on the wall when she came though Washington last year to confront her main critic in the US, Jesse Helms of the Foreign Affairs Committee and heavy-hitter for the tobacco lobby.</p> <p>Del Ponte was born in Lugano in 1947, and began practising law in her hometown.

      "bodyText": "Some people are usefully described by their enemies, who have cause to fear and despise them. The Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic and his hate-machine media call Carla del Ponte 'the new Gestapo'. The Cosa Nostra mobsters of Sicily who tried to blow up del Ponte in 1988 like to brand her ' La Puttana ' - 'the whore' - and one of the many banking executives into whose affairs she snooped as Attorney General of Switzerland defines her as 'an unguided missile'. Dominique Poncet, a fellow Swiss lawyer, worried that del Ponte's campaign against banking secrecy might drive foreign custom away from these gnomes of Zurich, described her colleague as 'not good for Switzerland'. But a friend, the assassinated anti-Mafia hero judge Giovanni Falcone, called his colleague 'the personification of stubbornness' and del Ponte in turn describes herself as simply: 'a chain smoker' and 'a prosecutor'. Carla del Ponte is currently chief prosecutor for two historic institutions that have become metaphors for our era - whether they stand or fall: the international tribunals on war crimes established at The Hague - trying those accused of crimes committed in former Yugoslavia - and at Arusha, trying defendants from the Rwandan genocide. The tribunal established during the maelstrom of the Bosnian war in 1994 was at first dismissed as an unarmed hunter unlikely to bag any big game. It took nearly two years to hear the first case and the defendant in the first genocide trial (in which, declaring an interest, I testified for the prosecution) died in custody of a massive heart attack. The diabolical triad of prize indictees - Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic - remain at liberty. But some epic events have occurred at The Hague of late, which bear the unmistakable hallmark of Carla del Ponte. Suddenly, the court has become a judicial bowling alley, defendants going down like skittles. The conviction was secured last week of its most senior defendant, the Bosnian Croat political commander Dario Kordic, for directing a series of horrific massacres of Muslims along the Lasva valley, and his aide-de-camp. But far more significant, last month came a piece of history in our lifetime. Three Bosnian Serbs from Foca were convicted in the first ever war crimes trial dealing exclusively with sexual offences - charges that seared the imagination of even the most hardened of lawyers or war reporters; the systematic mass rape and torture of captive women and young girls. Here was not only justice being done, but justice being played in a new, female key; painted in new, female colours that depicted rape as a tool of war and crime against humanity. If The Hague was conceived as proceeding in the traditions of Nuremberg, this was a crime of which the male world of those trials had not even attempted to convict the Nazis, for all the copious evidence available. The Foca verdict came on the slipstream of two civil suits against an absentee Radovan Kadadzic filed through New York by women who had been raped at the Omarska concentration camp, in which the juries asked the judge for permission to award up to 10 times the maximum damages allowed. Systematic rape was also a component part in the conviction for genocide of Jean-Paul Akayesu, a Hutu leader in the Rwanda genocide, at the Arusha court last year. But the central and sole conviction for mass rape in Foca ended once and for all grotesque doubts that some had sought to cast over the veracity of the accounts of women raped in Bosnia, which first surfaced in 1992. Others seemed to find it hard to deal with. The then UN envoy David Owen, when pressed in Sarajevo to draft a response, said: 'It's very difficult to talk to the Serbs about this kind of thing.' The investigation was made by a tenacious American female attorney, Nancy Patterson, and the verdict delivered by a female judge, Florence Mumba of Zambia. But it is impossible for the world not to associate the conviction with del Ponte and the success of the prosecution's case with the feminisation of The Hague tribunal. Carla del Ponte is third in a line of formidable women at The Hague - the others were the judge in the first case who became its president, Gabrielle Kirk MacDonald, a black civil rights judge from Texas; and judge Louise Arbour of Canada, whom del Ponte replaced in September 1999. Del Ponte was the first career prosecutor to step into the prosecutor's shoes. And what a prosecutor she was: a woman who, as she puts it herself, 'never served anyone or anything but the law', and a woman with enemies; a veteran of the war through the courts against the Cosa Nostra, the Russian Mafia, Swiss bank secrecy, Colombian drug cartels and more. She was the only figure in Swiss pubic life with a 24-hour personal armed guard. The first things you notice about Carla del Ponte are her height and the cigarettes. She is a powerhouse a little over five feet tall and lights one cigarette from the other. Oh to have been a fly on the wall when she came though Washington last year to confront her main critic in the US, Jesse Helms of the Foreign Affairs Committee and heavy-hitter for the tobacco lobby. Del Ponte was born in Lugano in 1947, and began practising law in her hometown. Somewhere along the way, she married and divorced a man about whom she will say nothing, and gave birth to a son about whom she says little. She was soon appointed public prosecutor and carved the tracks of her career when seconded to the 'Pizza Connection' Mafia investigation, crossing a perilous line by decoding numerical Swiss accounts held by the Cosa Nostra. Inevitably, she paid a visit to Sicily to meet the man with whom she worked hand-in-glove, the celebrated judge Falcone, and was with him in his house one summer's day in 1988 when the carabinieri found 100lb of Semtex packed into the foundations - just in time.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Animals exist for us. Farmers understand this, which is why whenever they are pushed in front of a mike for a quote on their most recent plight, they describe the spread of foot and mouth as a farming crisis, a tragedy that is blighting human communities. Animals don't get a look in. They are an economic, not an emotional, investment, and now that their value as foodstuff has been destroyed - who among us wants to eat a desiccated chop from an emaciated animal? - the farmers know what to do: slaughter the infected animals and wait for compensation. They see no intrinsic value in the four-legged critters. Even though foot and mouth is not a life threatening disease (just a cattle form of flu), the farmers are matter of fact about killing off their animals when they don't weigh enough to bring in a healthy profit.</p> <p>They see no reason to spare them - even if the government allowed them to - once they've become useless; they're just a meal ticket. Indeed, this unsentimental view of sheep and cows explains why we have an outbreak of disease in the first place. When you see livestock as your livelihood you don't give a toss about their quality of life. If you did, you wouldn't opt for the kind of intensive farming that packs animals in cramped quarters or asphyxiating battery sheds, stuffs them with unnatural feeds, inject them with hormones. The farmer views these conditions not as cruel but as cost-effective.</p> <p>Yet the vast majority of Britons, the 90 per cent plus who live outside the farming community, describe the fate of farm animals in Holocaust terms. The talk is of funeral pyres and barbaric slaughter and a Schindler's List of the few marked for survival.</p> <p>It is the usual hyperbole the British go in for when they talk of four-legged, fanged or furred beings. Ever since it became primarily an industrialised, rather than agricultural, country, Britain has lost all perspective on animals. In France and Italy, where agriculture still employs a sizable proportion of the population, and plays a significant role in the economy, a farmer is a pivotal figure and a sheep is just a sheep. But in a Britain where the farmer and his animals are a rare sighting, many believe the farmer is in reality a BBC producer with a second home in Shropshire, a hobby farmer who waxes lyrical about his organic turnips and the glossy pigs that feed on them. His animals are not a means of livelihood, but essential figures in the bucolic landscape that is the urbanite's interpretation of rural England.</p> <p>This attitude has turned the beasts of burden that from Biblical times were there for our service and our stomach into creatures indistinguishable from ourselves. Urban dwellers whose encounters with the animal kingdom are limited to a squirrel in the park or a fat pigeon in the square, are equally ignorant of the farm animal's habits and the wild animal's haunts. And so they invest these mysterious little beings with a Walt Disney sentimentality that depicts them as soft cuddly and unfailingly benevolent. There is no room in this fantasia of fauna for the fox that - shock horror - eats the rabbit or the mink that kills the water vole. To them nature is not Blake's vision of red in tooth and claw, but pretty in pink, a nursery mural rather than a feral landscape.</p> <p>This silly anthropomorphism turns dangerous when it turns the fox into the Anne Frank of the countryside - hiding from the uniformed fascist hunters; and the lamb transported across the channel in a cattle truck into a victim of ethnic cleansing. Gross distortions like these belittle human dignity and suffering, and defile the memory of victims of war, violence and disasters. The smoke and smell of the burning carcasses of diseased cattle may be very similar to the funeral pyres that immolate the remains of the Gujarat earthquake victims - but there is no moral equivalence. To think that there is betrays bankrupt ethics that regard man as no better than sheep.</p> <p>When Britain was a God-fearing country, this would have been blasphemy. We were taught that God made all creatures - but only man in his image. In the divine order, man with soul ranked well above animal without. Now we've ditched God, we've lost this hierarchy; every living being is value free. The farmer's plight is no worse than his calf's, his rights no greater.</p> <p>Once you accept this blurring of the species, you follow a ridiculous, if not downright wicked, logic. One animal sentimentalist of my acquaintance toured India for three weeks and the only charitable donation he made during the entire trip was to a donkey sanctuary. The dumb, grey beasties looked so vulnerable, he tearfully explained to me, in the middle of a market place teeming with starving beggars, legless lepers and sunken eyed children.</p> <p>I remember, too, going with some friends to see Gorillas in the Mist in London. In one scene, a gorilla's paw is cut off so that the evil hunter may sell it on as an ashtray. One of the women started bawling in the darkened room, her sobs hysterical and piercing as she indulged in a bleeding-heart exhibitionism that no brutal footage about Bosnia or Rwanda had ever triggered.</p> <p>But to erase the distinction between man and beast can prove more damaging than this show of insensitivity; it can place lives at risk. Inflate the value of animal life, and you won't sacrifice a dog for a child. This kind of wrong-headed prioritising is already causing damage. Scientists involved in animal experimentation know that their lab work on mice, beagle or marmoset may save millions of lives - or at least alleviate their suffering. Yet they must work in bunker-style conditions and live in fear of attacks from animal rights activists like the one that left Brian Cass of Huntingdon Life Sciences semiconscious.</p> <p>I claim an interest in animal experimentation.

      "bodyText": "Animals exist for us. Farmers understand this, which is why whenever they are pushed in front of a mike for a quote on their most recent plight, they describe the spread of foot and mouth as a farming crisis, a tragedy that is blighting human communities. Animals don't get a look in. They are an economic, not an emotional, investment, and now that their value as foodstuff has been destroyed - who among us wants to eat a desiccated chop from an emaciated animal? - the farmers know what to do: slaughter the infected animals and wait for compensation. They see no intrinsic value in the four-legged critters. Even though foot and mouth is not a life threatening disease (just a cattle form of flu), the farmers are matter of fact about killing off their animals when they don't weigh enough to bring in a healthy profit. They see no reason to spare them - even if the government allowed them to - once they've become useless; they're just a meal ticket. Indeed, this unsentimental view of sheep and cows explains why we have an outbreak of disease in the first place. When you see livestock as your livelihood you don't give a toss about their quality of life. If you did, you wouldn't opt for the kind of intensive farming that packs animals in cramped quarters or asphyxiating battery sheds, stuffs them with unnatural feeds, inject them with hormones. The farmer views these conditions not as cruel but as cost-effective. Yet the vast majority of Britons, the 90 per cent plus who live outside the farming community, describe the fate of farm animals in Holocaust terms. The talk is of funeral pyres and barbaric slaughter and a Schindler's List of the few marked for survival. It is the usual hyperbole the British go in for when they talk of four-legged, fanged or furred beings. Ever since it became primarily an industrialised, rather than agricultural, country, Britain has lost all perspective on animals. In France and Italy, where agriculture still employs a sizable proportion of the population, and plays a significant role in the economy, a farmer is a pivotal figure and a sheep is just a sheep. But in a Britain where the farmer and his animals are a rare sighting, many believe the farmer is in reality a BBC producer with a second home in Shropshire, a hobby farmer who waxes lyrical about his organic turnips and the glossy pigs that feed on them. His animals are not a means of livelihood, but essential figures in the bucolic landscape that is the urbanite's interpretation of rural England. This attitude has turned the beasts of burden that from Biblical times were there for our service and our stomach into creatures indistinguishable from ourselves. Urban dwellers whose encounters with the animal kingdom are limited to a squirrel in the park or a fat pigeon in the square, are equally ignorant of the farm animal's habits and the wild animal's haunts. And so they invest these mysterious little beings with a Walt Disney sentimentality that depicts them as soft cuddly and unfailingly benevolent. There is no room in this fantasia of fauna for the fox that - shock horror - eats the rabbit or the mink that kills the water vole. To them nature is not Blake's vision of red in tooth and claw, but pretty in pink, a nursery mural rather than a feral landscape. This silly anthropomorphism turns dangerous when it turns the fox into the Anne Frank of the countryside - hiding from the uniformed fascist hunters; and the lamb transported across the channel in a cattle truck into a victim of ethnic cleansing. Gross distortions like these belittle human dignity and suffering, and defile the memory of victims of war, violence and disasters. The smoke and smell of the burning carcasses of diseased cattle may be very similar to the funeral pyres that immolate the remains of the Gujarat earthquake victims - but there is no moral equivalence. To think that there is betrays bankrupt ethics that regard man as no better than sheep. When Britain was a God-fearing country, this would have been blasphemy. We were taught that God made all creatures - but only man in his image. In the divine order, man with soul ranked well above animal without. Now we've ditched God, we've lost this hierarchy; every living being is value free. The farmer's plight is no worse than his calf's, his rights no greater. Once you accept this blurring of the species, you follow a ridiculous, if not downright wicked, logic. One animal sentimentalist of my acquaintance toured India for three weeks and the only charitable donation he made during the entire trip was to a donkey sanctuary. The dumb, grey beasties looked so vulnerable, he tearfully explained to me, in the middle of a market place teeming with starving beggars, legless lepers and sunken eyed children. I remember, too, going with some friends to see Gorillas in the Mist in London. In one scene, a gorilla's paw is cut off so that the evil hunter may sell it on as an ashtray. One of the women started bawling in the darkened room, her sobs hysterical and piercing as she indulged in a bleeding-heart exhibitionism that no brutal footage about Bosnia or Rwanda had ever triggered. But to erase the distinction between man and beast can prove more damaging than this show of insensitivity; it can place lives at risk. Inflate the value of animal life, and you won't sacrifice a dog for a child. This kind of wrong-headed prioritising is already causing damage. Scientists involved in animal experimentation know that their lab work on mice, beagle or marmoset may save millions of lives - or at least alleviate their suffering. Yet they must work in bunker-style conditions and live in fear of attacks from animal rights activists like the one that left Brian Cass of Huntingdon Life Sciences semiconscious. I claim an interest in animal experimentation. My half-brother, Lorenzo, suffers from a rare neurological disorder called adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). His only hope lies in a series of experiments being conducted in hidden locations throughout Britain and the US. If someone you love is fighting for his life and owes his survival to animal experiments, you have no doubt that research scientists must continue their work unmolested by terrorists who, as others have pointed out, have in all likelihood, at some point, benefited from a drug at one time tested on animals. To witness Lorenzo's fate and then confront a placard-waving mob outside the laboratory where men and women are working to find the key to his condition, is to gag with bitterness. Yes, I feel uneasy about the ordeals that lab animals suffer - being shaved for x-rays, having a catheter introduced into their throat, being force-fed. But if these procedures lead to a cure for even one child, I have no doubt that this suffering is necessary. There is nothing like watching someone you love suffer, to convince you of the difference between a child's torment and a puppy's or a calf's. There is a hierarchy of beings, and we humans stand at the top. Our first allegiance must be to one another; this calls for a challenge to the universe we have devised, wherein a farmer's ruin is of no greater consequence than an animal's killing; and a child's health of no greater value than a marmoset's. \u0095 Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman Related articles Comment: Foot and mouth; not many voters lost Comment: Sacrifices on the altar of cheap food Comment: Paying the price for cheaper food Around the country - foot and mouth latest Disease suspected on Continent Fear grows in plague village Ireland put under plague siege Law to break supermarkets' grip on farmers Today we burn the past.

The border was closed to livestock traffic. 'If we do nothing, it will spread across our country fast. My specialists are convinced,' French Health Minister Bernard Kouchner said. 'If it doesn't reach France, we can consider it a real miracle.' It is feared several sheep among a flock of 80 at a farm in Roche-la-Moliere, in the Loire region, have the disease. A public veterinary official said initial tests proved negative, but results from additional ones were not due until tomorrow. The Belgian Farm Ministry was investigating a suspected case at a pig farm at Diksmuide, near the French border in western Flanders. An official said initial laboratory tests had been negative. But Agriculture Minister Jaak Gabriels ordered a nationwide ban on the transport of live farm animals.

      "body": "<p>Highampton is a modern-day plague village. It lies at the centre of a viral hot zone, surrounded by farms infected with foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>Life here has come to a complete halt. Dozens of families in the farms around the hamlet have practically barricaded themselves into their homes. Some have not left their farms in almost a week.</p> <p>The village has been transformed from a sleepy backwater in the rolling hills of mid-Devon to a surreal place reminiscent of the Black Death or the aftermath of a nuclear accident. Signs on gates, often painted in big red letters, warn visitors to keep out. Straw soaked in disinfectant has been laid across farm roads, and buckets of it stand at gates for the few allowed in to soak their boots.</p> <p>The village primary school has shut for fear of spreading the virus further - either between farms or infecting children from neighbouring villages. Church services, too, have halted. The church warden, who had the only keys to the vestry, lives on a farm and cannot leave it or be visited. Traffic on the lanes around Highampton has dwindled to a trickle as local markets have closed, and trips to the shops are being kept to an absolute minimum.</p> <p>In the village itself, the white-coated figures of officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food wander from house to house, telling the occupants the latest news and giving them advice. After anyone, from a doctor to a vet, leaves an infected farm he or she has to burn overalls and change clothes. So great is the fear of the virus that even their pens and papers are left behind to be destroyed. The people of Highampton are scared and bewildered. Foot and mouth does not kill but they know it could destroy their livelihoods and their way of life.</p> <p>Ross Baker, 35, farms land just inside the five-mile exclusion zone set up round Highampton's Burdon Farm, where the outbreak began in Devon and spread to infect at least seven other farms. Baker says that, after BSE, things were just beginning to improve. 'I grew up here and I would like my son to follow me. I want to go on farming, but I will have to see if my overdraft can take it. This really is a disaster,' he said.</p> <p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of the crisis. Morris Thomas, 61, runs an old people's home deep in the exclusion zone. He has a special pass that allows him out, but he cannot set foot on a farm for fear of passing on the virus. He is worried about the mental state of his brother, George, whose farm may be infected, but he cannot go inside the property to see him. 'I went to talk to him because he is under a lot of strain and he came down to the gate and we spoke over the fence. We didn't want to get too close for fear of passing it around,' he said.</p> <p>A grim fatalism has settled on the countryside as the culling of thousands of animals in the area has begun. In an industry battered and bruised by food scares, foot and mouth is seen as the final straw for some farmers. 'This is a calamity; it is of horrendous magnitude. People are extremely frightened and there is an anticipation of doom,' said Asad Aldoori, the village doctor. It took until Wednesday for Aldoori to secure a permit to visit two farmers who needed counselling. Now that he has been on an infected farm, Aldoori cannot visit any other farm for at least five days. 'But I had to go,' he said, 'they just needed someone to talk to, and perhaps something to help them sleep.'</p> <p>Local churches are also involved. But again the full extent of the disaster prevents visits to many of the farmers feeling the strain, as herds and flocks built up over generations disappear in the smoke of a bonfire.</p> <p>Alan Andrew, a lay worker with the Methodist Church, is manning his farm's phone all day to answer calls from his depressed neighbours. Neither he, nor anyone in their family, has left their farm since Sunday, but he is ready to talk. 'It is my faith that keeps me going. But I am here for everyone, no matter whether they are church people or not. I just tell them to stay at home and hang on in there. I am a farmer too and they like to hear it from someone who understands them.'</p> <p>Ian Harris's tragic story is becoming all too typical. He built up his business over almost 20 years, from a single flock of sheep to two farms in the Highampton area.</p> <p>Now all his sheep have been shot. His cows will most likely follow. Almost a lifetime's work has been destroyed. 'I feel sick,' Harris said.</p> <p>He first noticed the disease on Wednesday, when several of his sheep could not walk properly or feed and kept on licking their lips. Harris, 48, had never seen the virus's effects before, but he knew straight away that he had fallen victim to it. A quick visit by Ministry officials soon confirmed his fears. Now he faces an uncertain future. When the crisis finally rolls to a halt, people like Harris will be barred from keeping any animals on their land for a further six months. That means no income and he must search for any part-time work going.</p> <p>'My farm will be a dead farm. I will need to get some work, but my farm has been infected, I might be seen as some kind of hazard.'</p> <p>For Harris, who appears stoical, the reality of the situation has not yet sunk in but he knows that when he wakes up this week with two empty farms and compensation pay-outs months away, it will hit him hard.</p> <p>'At the moment I have things to do still but when I don't, that will be difficult.'</p> <p>Despite the determination of people such as Harris, some are worried that the crisis could impel Highampton farmers to leave the land. Previous crises have left many in the red and financial rewards seem a lot greater off the farm than on it. It would be the end of a way of life. Rural Devon is still a tight-knit community where surnames in a village often go back centuries and some farms have been in the same family for 100 years.</p> <p>Despite the disaster, there is little real anger. Farmers mutter about cheap foreign imports bringing in the disease and the closure of local abattoirs allowing it to spread so quickly. But Highampton is still too numb with shock to voice any real rage.</p> <p>Instead an eerie silence seems to dominate the landscape. 'In the fields it is just so quiet - even the birds are hardly making any noise. I can't explain it. It is like everything knows something is wrong,' Harris said.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,446099,00.html\">Comment: A cow is just a cow</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,446098,00.html\">Comment: Foot and mouth; not many voters lost</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446139,00.html\">Comment: Sacrifices on the altar of cheap food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4141953,00.html\">Comment: Paying the price for cheaper food</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446142,00.html\">Around the country - foot and mouth latest</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446162,00.html\">Disease suspected on Continent</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446158,00.html\">Ireland put under plague siege</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446160,00.html\"> Law to break supermarkets' grip on farmers </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,446135,00.html\"> Today we burn the past.

Each is addressed to a different type of voter identified by the apparatchiks at Millbank as vital to winning the election. They are: MRS MORTGAGE A modified form of the famous Worcester woman, Mrs Mortgage has been identified by Labour as the Middle England voter they must woo. Married, with a three-bedroom house in the Midlands, she worries about interest rate rises and what they will do to her weekly household budget. She abandoned the Tories after interest rates hit 15 per cent, decided on Labour but is now not so sure. Is impressed by: economic stability, tax cuts, low interest rates Is unimpressed by: boom and bust, plans to ban hunting, Islington chattering classes MR SQUEEZE The voter who actually prefers the Liberal Democrats but will be willing to vote Labour to keep the Tories out. Could be the saviour in tens of marginal Labour-held seats where the Lib Dems are in third place. Needs to be told about the disaster that the Tories were and convinced that a vote for the Lib Dems is a wasted vote. Is impressed by: public spending, radical constitutional change, positive announcements, Gordon Brown Is unimpressed by: tax cuts, talk of bogus asylum seekers, negative attacks, Jack Straw MRS WEAK Labour's Holy Grail, the voter who switched to Labour at the last election but does not hold her convictions deeply. A close relative of Mrs Mortgage, she would like to vote Labour again but is worried that they have failed on crime and that public services aren't getting any better. Needs to be convinced that the statement 'all politicians are the same' is untrue. Is impressed by: toughness, private enterprise, Jack Straw Is unimpressed by: unions, any form of 'tax credit', helping single mothers Other reports: Family fortunes Don't scare the horses in the City Giving credit where tax credit's due Now, will the real Gordon Brown please stand up? When prudence turns dangerous Gordon's tonic: the hot tips More cash and time off for mothers Mr Brown, Mr Balls and the elusive Mrs Mortgage",

The Chancellor likes to read papers between 6am and 7.30am, his office explained, before coming into the department. He needs to be able to get to any official while they're digesting their morning toast.</p> <p>Over the past two weeks, Brown and his tight entourage of staff have been in what officials describe as 'Budget blitz' mode. From 6am Brown is on the telephone. With his two special advisers, Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, he has been worrying away, grinding the figures, totting up the advantages and disadvantages of a tweak here, a tweak there.</p> <p>How will the latest details on increasing maternity pay work? How will widening the 10p tax band be made to look like a tax cut for everybody? How much will a family on average earnings of \u00a325,000 be better off if all the tax and benefit changes kick in on 5 April? About \u00a3370, Gordon, came the reply.</p> <p>It is a punishing schedule. At 7.30am his car arrives for the short journey from the Westminster home he shares with wife Sarah Macaulay to the Treasury. There he continues his machinations, banging out his thoughts on a laptop in large block capitals, all the more easy to read for a man with poor eyesight.</p> <p>Sometimes his secretary brings in a projector. Brown's laptop thoughts are beamed onto a screen so that Balls and Miliband can see what he is writing, his Budget speech the centre of attention. No one else is in the room, a smaller, more private study off the original cavernous office Brown first occupied.</p> <p>They bash phrases backwards and forwards - what will tickle the party, what will tickle the nation? - the loyalty of his two trusted lieutenants unquestioned. Not for Brown the process established by his predecessors. It is not officials who draft the Budget speech but the Chancellor himself.</p> <p>Balls is the chief economic adviser to the Treasury. He is the channel through which every minute passes, and he has succeeded in outmanoeuvring the civil servants to ensure that his master's will is done. Brown and Balls hate endless memos. They keep their thoughts in their heads and in Brown's computer. It's safer that way. Not for nothing is Balls nicknamed the deputy chancellor.</p> <p>The other Ed is the brother of David Miliband, head of the Downing Street policy unit. But even the family link is not enough to allow No 10 a peek at Brown's detailed thinking. The Chancellor ensures that the Prime Minister is kept up with the broad themes, but the details are under wraps until the last minute. Other members of the Cabinet are not told about their specific areas of spending until a few days before the big day.</p> <p>The Cabinet as a whole will have to wait until Wednesday morning to hear about the Budget speech. They received a note last month from Downing Street saying Blair had moved the weekly Cabinet meeting forward to next Wednesday morning so that Brown could tell them what was going on. Five hours later Brown will get up in the House of Commons, pile up a set of books so that he can rest his speech high enough for him to see it and tell the nation what he is up to.</p> <p>The Chancellor is not a man for formal meetings. Recent relations between the Chancellor's and Prime Minister's teams have improved, but the tension remains. Brown sees the Treasury as the natural headquarters of economic and social policy. Blair wants to concentrate power in No 10, the Policy Unit and the Cabinet Secretariat. The Treasury - tight-knit, secretive, ferociously intelligent - is winning the battle.</p> <p>Thanks to a series of judiciously timed leaks, it is now becoming clear where Brown's priorities lie. Women, the voters Labour fears are most disillusioned with Tony Blair the politician and New Labour the Government, are to be wooed like never before.</p> <p>Maternity pay will be boosted, rules on how many tax benefits new parents can claim will be relaxed, benefits for families with children will be increased. And the new Labour worry, Mrs Mortgage, will be told that interest rates and mortgage repayments are at their lowest for years. Everything, from a reduction in stamp duty for new homes in deprived areas to boosts for single parents, will be given a family-friendly edge.</p> <p>It has all been planned with meticulous care. In 1998 Brown started plotting the route to the next election, fixed already in his mind as May 2001. Each year the Budget has had slightly more to give away, culminating in the Treasury's 'red-letter day', 5 April 2001.</p> <p>On that day, in a month's time, a series of tax and benefit changes will kick in. Pensions will increase, rules on how much money the elderly can save before they have to pay for their own care will be relaxed, child benefit will increase, road tax will be cut for millions of cars, tax credits aimed at those earning under \u00a340,000 will be launched.</p> <p>Poorer families will be up to \u00a32,600 a year better off. Tax cuts through the increase in the 10p income tax band will mean everyone has a little more in their pocket. An election will be called. Blair will win. Brown will be the man behind it. Perfect.</p> <p>The procession of high-heels clicking across the varnished floorboards upstairs at No 11 Downing Street shortly after the last two Budgets were the first sign. Over the white wine and canap\u00e9s, Brown struggled manfully to make small talk with magazine editors anxious to know where he bought his suits.</p> <p>Sarah Macaulay circled among guests ranging from female MPs and journalists to prominent women such as Germaine Greer and even Cherie Booth.</p> <p>But as with everything Brown does, there was a carefully calculated point to it all - to show that the Chancellor sympathised with women.</p> <p>It underlined a message the Budgets had already made clear with promises of massive increases in childcare places, tax breaks for working women to pay for those childcare places, even the scrapping of VAT on sanitary products last year, a matter so embarrassing to the Chancellor that he failed to mention it in his speech and left it to a junior Minister to brief journalists afterwards.</p> <p>Labour campaign strategists have identified Mrs Mortgage as the woman they have to woo. Middle England, middle income, hard-working, she will be the target of the election campaign. She was picked after research revealed that it was women who were least impressed with the Government's multi-billion pound economic arguments and felt that Labour had failed to be as modernising at it had claimed it would be.</p> <p>The Chancellor has taken this on board, despite his predominantly male core of advisers. Helping him to win Mrs Mortgage's trust are Harriet Harman, an old Brown ally and former Minister, Maeve Sherlock, the former head of the National Council of One Parent Families, and Treasury ministers Dawn Primarolo and Melanie Johnson.</p> <p>Primarolo and Johnson have linked up with the two Women's Ministers, Tessa Jowell and Margaret Jay. It was Primarolo, once a struggling single mother herself, who fought for the children's tax credit to be drawn by mothers as well as fathers, following fears that in some households it would never be spent on the children.</p> <p>But there have been some hiccups for Brown. This week's announcement on maternity pay follows intense haggling between his officials and the women's lobby: the Chancellor favoured targeting help on poor new mothers, arguing that wealthy women earning large salaries did not need the state to top up their bank balances when they gave birth. But he has relented and will announce on Wednesday that the state will provide maternity pay for all, with a likely top-up for those most in need through extra tax credits.</p> <p>Brown is acutely aware that Labour's election hopes will be heavily dependent on his performance in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Party officials know that if the public are not convinced, then the chances of another huge majority could suffer, even though some opinion polls are already predicting such an outcome on 3 May, which is still the favoured date for a poll.</p> <p>Other reports: <br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445997,00.html\">Family fortunes</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446002,00.html\">Don't scare the horses in the City</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445996,00.html\">Giving credit where tax credit's due</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,445995,00.html\">Now, will the real Gordon Brown please stand up?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446004,00.html\">When prudence turns dangerous</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446003,00.html\">Gordon's tonic: the hot tips</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446179,00.html\">Is Labour aiming at you?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446180,00.html\">More cash and time off for mothers</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,446178,00.html\">Mr Brown, Mr Balls and the elusive Mrs Mortgage</a></p>",

Frozen fish sales were up by 40 per cent. \u0095 Approximately 45,000 animals have now been slaughtered as a result of the disease, including 6,300 animals which may have come into contact with infected animals. \u0095 The Government announced an investigation into the implications of increased world travel, globalisation of trade and modern farming methods on issues of disease control. \u0095 Officials started preparing special licences to allow healthy animals to start being moved from disease-free areas to abattoirs on Tuesday. \u0095 Walkers abused a local council official putting up signs asking people to keep off footpaths in Basildon, Essex, because of foot and mouth. Police were called and the walkers were reminded local authorities had the power to prosecute. \u0095 Police took away the firearms of a distraught farmer 'heartbroken' by the loss of livestock from foot and mouth disease. Cattle and sheep farmer George Thomas called the emergency services asking for police and TV cameras to attend his farm.

The Glasnost Foundation, Moscow's Helsinki Watch and the Memorial group, claim that training the KGB's successor agency to defuse bombs manufactured by terror groups such as the IRA could be highly dangerous. The three human rights groups say suspicion hangs over the Russian FSB's role in a series of bombings in Moscow three years ago, which the authorities claimed were the work of Chechen terrorists. Twelve FSB officers are nearing the end of a six-week training course with the Irish Defence Forces' Ordnance Corps. The Russians are in Ireland at the invitation of Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to learn from the Irish army's experience in dealing with 'improvised' IRA and loyalist bombs. The Irish Defence Forces and the British Army are world experts in dealing with sophisticated 'improvised' bombs after 30 years of terrorism in Northern Ireland. But Sergei Grigoriants, the president of the Glasnost Foundation in Moscow, expressed doubt about the wisdom of the training project. 'This kind of project can be useful only if there is a guarantee that the newly acquired expertise will be used solely for peaceful purposes,' he said. 'But we have no such guarantee.

      "bodyText": "New mothers are to be given a significant boost in maternity pay and the right to take six months off work as the Government directs the last Budget before the general election towards wooing women voters. As a war on tax erupted between the two main parties yesterday, Government sources revealed that a central part of Chancellor Gordon Brown's \u00a34 billion giveaway, to be announced on Wednesday, will be an expected increase in the flat rate of maternity pay from \u00a360 a week to \u00a3100 a week. The present 18 weeks maternity leave will be extended to 26 weeks. The Chancellor is using the Budget to respond to concerns that women voters are turning away from the Government, which they believe has not been as radical as expected and has failed to modernise Britain's struggling public services. The new maternity package will be bolstered by allowing mothers to claim the new working families tax credit - cash back through the pay packet - from the birth of the baby onwards, effectively targeting most help on those who are least well-off. Previously it could take up to six months before women could get the extra money. 'We hope this is going to be a very, very good package for women,' said one senior source. 'Our absolute determination has been that the greatest help should be for the poorest women. The aim is that women can have long enough to get to know their new babies, which up until now has been the prerogative of the better-off.' However, the Chancellor is understood to have rejected demands from unions and other campaigners for a major extension of earnings-related maternity pay. At the moment women get 90 per cent of their usual earnings paid by the state for the first six weeks, then go on to a much lower flat rate for the rest of their time off. The maternity pay will be one of a package of measures aimed at making the Budget as 'family friendly' as possible, a move which the Prime Minister has told colleagues is vital to winning the election. Brown will also announce a large extension of the 10p tax band which will be trumpeted as a 'tax cut for all'. Although he is thought to have rejected an across the board 1p cut in income tax as appearing too profligate, he will say that from April families on average earnings of \u00a325,000 will be \u00a3370 a year better off. He will also claim that poorer families on \u00a312,500 a year will be \u00a32,600 a year better off and will have the lowest direct tax burden since 1972. Yesterday, Michael Portillo, the Shadow Chancellor, upped the war on tax by pledging that he would match any tax cuts announced in the Budget. Speaking at the Conservatives spring conference in Harrogate, Portillo said the promise came on top of \u00a38 billion of cuts the Tories have already said they can achieve. He also said that indirect taxes, so-called 'stealth taxes', meant that everyone was now paying the equivalent of 10p extra on the basic rate of income tax. Labour dismissed the claims, saying that Portillo had a black hole in his spending plans which could only be filled by increasing national borrowing and pushing up interest rates. The Treasury had initially balked at increasing maternity leave, concerned that it would mainly benefit wealthier high-flyers who are keenest to return to work. But it has been persuaded by arguments that having a child is the single biggest strain on family incomes - and that if women are allowed to take long enough off to bond with their babies and return only when they are ready, they are less likely to drop out of the labour market. The children's tax credit, which will be given to parents earning up to \u00a340,000, is also likely to be introduced at a higher than expected rate of \u00a310 a week from April.

Now he is entrenching his rule and neutralising any independent forces. On Friday his government finessed the exit of the Chief Justice, Anthony Gubbay. It is also continuing its attacks on the local and foreign press, white farmers and the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).</p> <p>Known MDC supporters in Harare's townships are harassed and beaten by a motley collection of army, police, war veterans and young thugs.</p> <p>The icing on the cake for Mugabe is being welcomed in Paris this week by French President Jacques Chirac and in Brussels by Belgium and the European Union. On the agenda in his talks will be the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which Zimbabwe is a key player, rather than internal affairs. Calls being made in Britain for Mugabe to be arrested and charged for gross human rights abuses will be ignored.</p> <p>Mugabe has triumphed in getting Chief Justice Gubbay to go on leave immediately and to take early retirement from 1 July. His removal clears away one of the most substantial obstacles to the government's policies, particularly its 'fast track' land seizures.</p> <p>Soft-spoken and even timid, Gubbay, 68, led the Supreme Court bench to make carefully reasoned, logical judgments which rejected Mugabe's land policy as violent, lawless and unlikely to improve the lives of those being resettled.</p> <p>The Supreme Court decisions, delivered in December and January, acknowledged the need to redistribute land to poor blacks to redress the historical injustice of the seizure of their land by white colonialists from 1890 to 1970. But it insisted the reforms must follow the law. This infuriated the Mugabe government which responded by calling the judges 'relics of Rhodesia' and racists.</p> <p>Mugabe's war veterans invaded the Supreme Court and chased the five justices away. The judges received death threats and were vilified in speeches by Mugabe and others.</p> <p>One of the most notorious of Mugabe's war veterans, Joseph Chinotimba, went to Gubbay's offices on Friday morning. Chinotimba has been identified at the centre of several violent incidents and has been charged with shooting his neighbour because she supports the MDC. After his visit to the Supreme Court chambers, Chinotimba announced that if Gubbay did not vacate his office, his war veterans would declare war upon him.</p> <p>Gubbay agreed to leave his office, but he wrested guarantees from the government that it would respect the independence of the courts and would not take unlawful steps to remove any other judges. 'Gubbay sacrificed himself so the other judges could stay,' said one legal expert.</p> <p>'Everyone knows that the only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him,' said lawyer and MDC member of parliament Tendai Biti. 'This has empowered the other judges to stand firm.'</p> <p>Other lawyers, however, are more sceptical of the guarantees, saying that if the government does not honour Supreme Court judgments, why should it honour agreements with Gubbay? They say once the government installs Godfrey Chidyausiku as Chief Justice, it will pursue its stated plan to clear the Supreme Court and the High Court of independent judges.</p> <p>The government, through the increasingly powerful Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, has already announced its intention to rid the Supreme Court of the four remaining justices and to clear out four judges from the high court.</p> <p>'The government expresses its lack of confidence in judges on the Supreme Court and the High Court,' said Moyo last week. 'We find those judges to be partial to white farming interests. We cannot have judges colluding with forces opposed to Zimbabwe. We must have judges who are part and parcel of our experience of the liberation struggle and who side with the majority of our people, especially the landless.'</p> <p>Moyo has also spearheaded the government's attacks on the independent press, both local and foreign. The expulsion last month of two foreign journalists gained a great deal of attention, but it is the Zimbabwean journalists who write for privately-owned newspapers critical of the Mugabe government who are most at risk. They are persevering under enormous pressure to expose human rights abuses and corruption.</p>",

The icing on the cake for Mugabe is being welcomed in Paris this week by French President Jacques Chirac and in Brussels by Belgium and the European Union. On the agenda in his talks will be the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which Zimbabwe is a key player, rather than internal affairs. Calls being made in Britain for Mugabe to be arrested and charged for gross human rights abuses will be ignored. Mugabe has triumphed in getting Chief Justice Gubbay to go on leave immediately and to take early retirement from 1 July. His removal clears away one of the most substantial obstacles to the government's policies, particularly its 'fast track' land seizures. Soft-spoken and even timid, Gubbay, 68, led the Supreme Court bench to make carefully reasoned, logical judgments which rejected Mugabe's land policy as violent, lawless and unlikely to improve the lives of those being resettled. The Supreme Court decisions, delivered in December and January, acknowledged the need to redistribute land to poor blacks to redress the historical injustice of the seizure of their land by white colonialists from 1890 to 1970. But it insisted the reforms must follow the law. This infuriated the Mugabe government which responded by calling the judges 'relics of Rhodesia' and racists. Mugabe's war veterans invaded the Supreme Court and chased the five justices away. The judges received death threats and were vilified in speeches by Mugabe and others. One of the most notorious of Mugabe's war veterans, Joseph Chinotimba, went to Gubbay's offices on Friday morning. Chinotimba has been identified at the centre of several violent incidents and has been charged with shooting his neighbour because she supports the MDC. After his visit to the Supreme Court chambers, Chinotimba announced that if Gubbay did not vacate his office, his war veterans would declare war upon him. Gubbay agreed to leave his office, but he wrested guarantees from the government that it would respect the independence of the courts and would not take unlawful steps to remove any other judges. 'Gubbay sacrificed himself so the other judges could stay,' said one legal expert. 'Everyone knows that the only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him,' said lawyer and MDC member of parliament Tendai Biti. 'This has empowered the other judges to stand firm.' Other lawyers, however, are more sceptical of the guarantees, saying that if the government does not honour Supreme Court judgments, why should it honour agreements with Gubbay? They say once the government installs Godfrey Chidyausiku as Chief Justice, it will pursue its stated plan to clear the Supreme Court and the High Court of independent judges. The government, through the increasingly powerful Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, has already announced its intention to rid the Supreme Court of the four remaining justices and to clear out four judges from the high court. 'The government expresses its lack of confidence in judges on the Supreme Court and the High Court,' said Moyo last week. 'We find those judges to be partial to white farming interests. We cannot have judges colluding with forces opposed to Zimbabwe. We must have judges who are part and parcel of our experience of the liberation struggle and who side with the majority of our people, especially the landless.' Moyo has also spearheaded the government's attacks on the independent press, both local and foreign. The expulsion last month of two foreign journalists gained a great deal of attention, but it is the Zimbabwean journalists who write for privately-owned newspapers critical of the Mugabe government who are most at risk. They are persevering under enormous pressure to expose human rights abuses and corruption.",

The government Yes The Government has driven the policy of cheap food that has lead to the industrialisation of agriculture which created the conditions for the disease to spread. No The Government implements strict controls on hygiene and animal husbandry that has ensured that Britain hasn't had a significant outbreak of foot and mouth for over 30 years.

If Ahern and his officials wanted to find the principal reason why the IRA would not and could not move on guns, they might have travelled 60 miles north into South Armagh, the region known as 'bandit country'.

Resistance to any move on decommissioning arms, such as sealing IRA bunkers with concrete, is strongest here. Local IRA units have even threatened to break away from the organisation if the leadership compromises its arms dumps. On the cusp of South Armagh, along the main Belfast to Dublin railway link, lies the physical evidence of the growing dissident threat. Two explosions have left large craters alongside the rail line close to two housing estates at the western edge of Newry. Train journeys between the two capitals remained disrupted over the weekend. Until recently most bomb attacks on the railway took place closer to the border with the Irish Republic, carried out by members of the Real IRA living along the frontier between South Armagh and North Louth. Local republicans say the shift in attacks on the line proves that the Real IRA has also established fresh terror units in Newry, normally a stronghold for Sinn Fein. Last year the Real IRA launched scores of terror attacks on British Army bases and police stations from the region. A British Army spokesman said there was real concern that there had been a lull in RIRA activity. 'A pause is always followed by a fresh wave of attacks, and we are expecting a new onslaught very soon,' he said. In 2000 the RIRA carried out a gun or bomb attack every 12 days, including the firing of a Russian-made rocket at MI6 headquarters in London last September. Several miles west of Newry is the village of Camlough, the home of Raymond McCreesh, an IRA prisoner who died on hunger strike in 1981. Every year republicans march to a memorial erected in honour of McCreesh on the left-hand side of the road between Camlough and Newry. This year, however, dissident republicans plan to hold a separate march to the memorial, another small but symbolic sign that the republican family in the area is drifting further apart. Into this fractious and fiercely independent republican region last Sunday stepped Brian Keenan, a Belfast-born IRA veteran with a long pedigree of involvement in republican armed struggle. Keenan, who directed the IRA bombing campaigns in Britain during the 1970s, was in Creggan, near Crossmaglen, to speak at a commemoration in honour of two IRA men who blew themselves up while transporting a bomb in 1988. One of the duo was Brendan Burns, who triggered the bombs that killed 18 British paratroopers at Warren Point in August 1979. On the same day the man who taught Burns how to make bombs, Thomas McMahon, blew up Lord Mountbatten and his fishing party in Sligo. South Armagh is after all the region where the IRA has launched most of its so-called 'spectaculars' in the Troubles. Surrounded by 800 republican supporters, some of them members of the Provisional IRA's elite South Armagh Brigade, Keenan issued a bellicose warning. 'Those who say the war is over, I don't know what they're talking about. The revolution can never be over until we have our country, until we have British imperialism where it belongs - in the dustbin of history,' he told his audience. Unionists, including First Minister David Trimble, have seized upon Keenan's remarks as proof the IRA was not only unwilling to decommission but ready and able to return to violence. Trimble demanded an explanation from Sinn Fein. But former IRA members who read Keenan's speech suspected the reason for his sabre-rattling was to keep the movement together in South Armagh and halt defections to the Real IRA, the group responsible for the Omagh atrocity in August 1998. 'The speech was more for internal than external consumption,' one former IRA volunteer told The Observer , 'Most of Keenan's speech emphasised republican unity and the need for cohesion while Sinn Fein is involved in negotiations. The speech should be viewed not primarily as a threat to the British but rather an appeal to keep unity.' Keenan is highly respected in South Armagh for his role in directing bombings and assassinations in Britain as well as helping to organise arms shipments and contacts with foreign governments, including Libya and Syria. One of the IRA's local commanders still loyal to the leadership is Thomas 'Slab' Murphy, a South Armagh farmer whose property straddles the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Murphy is not only an in-famous IRA leader but also a successful businessman whom the authorities on both sides of the border suspect made his fortune smuggling livestock and fuel back and forth across the frontier. Smuggling cattle, diesel, cigarettes, alcohol, fake CDs and perfume has helped fund the Provos' war effort, while amassing a fortune for those in charge of the operations. Smuggling is even celebrated in song as one local ballad written around 1940 boasts: Now when first the border started and 'twas seen that smuggling paid King George he ordered out his men to try and stop the trade 'But don't,' says he, 'pass Silverbridge, you might not come back again For there's not a cop would ever stop the boys of Crossmaglen On Friday, reporters and camera crews attempting to get close to Murphy's and other farms belonging to leading republicans were warded off by groups of men wearing leather jackets and sunglasses. Many of them threatened to break cameras if the crews advanced further. The media had descended on 'bandit country' to cover the presence of foot and mouth disease on a farm at Meigh, close to the Irish border. Moderate nationalist politicians, such as the SDLP's John Fee, blamed local republicans for smuggling the infected sheep from England to South Armagh, thus endangering the entire economy of Ireland. South Armagh's smugglers, said Fee, are now posing as much of a threat to both parts of Ireland as the Provisionals' South Armagh Brigade did. Fee, who was beaten up by the IRA for speaking out in 1994, has put himself at considerable risk. The presence of foot and mouth in the most dangerous part of Northern Ireland also poses a paradox for the Province's politicians. David Trimble, besieged by critics in his own party who want him to leave the power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, would dearly love the general election to be postponed. Trimble needs more time to persuade Sinn Fein that it must get the IRA to shift on arms, otherwise he will be deposed as Unionist leader and replaced by hardliners like Ian Paisley. If an election were called tomorrow, Trimble's Ulster Unionists would suffer heavy electoral losses at the hands of Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. Trimble, like Adams and McGuinness, is caught between the demands for internal unity and making concessions to traditional enemies. Yet if the foot and mouth crisis spreads, it could have a positive spin-off for the Irish peace process - the postponement of an election which many agree is hampering any chance of compromise between unionists and nationalists.",

'I say to the Giants it is not in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland,' Mallon said. In Britain supermarkets - including Asda, Safeway, Tesco and Sainsbury's - will face heavy fines if they fail to stick to the new rules.

The sushi bar is one of the most popular. It has kimono-clad waitresses and serious sushi chefs, but you have to take a numbered ticket before you can order, which leaves hopeful pescivores to mill about in front of a counter where things have been made to stand oddly to attention in aspic. Nothing here is cheap, but at the Bar Fromage opposite you can get one cheese with salad and a glass of house wine for \u00a39.75. Or there's the pizzeria, complete with roaring, wood-fired oven, a tapas bar in the wine section, a sea grill, rotisserie and oyster bar in the fish hall and an espresso bar above the root-veg display. No matter where you look, there are little cut-out policemen with flashing red bicycle lights, warning the light-fingered of CCTV in the store.",

      "body": "<p>Having children has meant an awful lot of nervous flicking through the Family Health Tome. Mine always falls open at the 'M' pages (measles, meningitis and mumps) but I usually end up daring myself to have a random and prurient peek at the grisly photographs and descriptions of symptoms in the pages preceeding or beyond. Once I have diagnosed my child, I feel I am at leisure to find something deeply unpleasant with symptoms closely resembling the feelings and discomforts I have been suffering in silence while selflessly tending to my family's health needs.</p> <p>I think that most of us suffer from a degree of anxiety about our health, and we certainly recognise it in those we live with. My cold is my husband's flu and my father's every sore throat 'streptococcal', while my son gives me a list of serious ailments each day which he self-diagnoses with a pessimism which would rival the hypochondriac in Moli\u00e8re's Le Malade Imaginaire .</p> <p>For the majority of us, however, these feelings of anxiety about our bodies malfunctioning are replaced by another preoccupation soon enough. It is amazing, for instance, how quickly my son perks up when I inform him that his 'broken wrist' will prohibit him from playing PlayStation that day. And even when we take our health concerns as far as a trip to the doctor, most of us are reassured by their diagnosis or opinion and quickly move on to worrying about money or schools or our marriage instead. For some people, though, this isn't the case - these feelings of preoccupation with a disease or indeed any number of illnesses don't pass but grow and start to dominate the way they think about themselves, their body and their future. The persistence of this anxiety about health is what separates the 'worried well' from the hypochondriac.</p> <p>Sheila Roderiquez, 52, is often told that her feeling that she has ovarian cancer is 'only' her imagination. She has had three private investigative operations, countless tests and visited more than 20 doctors in England, France and Spain. Nothing has been found to be medically wrong with her, yet that does not reassure or stop her trying to find 'better' medical advice.</p> <p>The fear, anticipation and certainty of having an illness has taken over, costing her time and money and affecting the quality of her life. Her husband, Freddo, feels that this experience is marring their life almost as much as a physical illness 'because increasingly she lives like an invalid. I think I have probably gone along with it all too much, but every time she saw a new doctor I thought she might believe what they had to say. Certainly my son now feels that I should help her to get over her fears.'</p> <p>Professor Paul Salkovskis is the clinical director of the Centre for Anxiety Disorders at the Maudsley hospital and treats cases of 'persistent health anxiety' (a term which has less negative connotations then hypochondria) with cognitive-behavioural therapy. 'People get anxious about what is important to them, and of course health is very important to most people. Those with severe health anxiety seem to interpret their bodily variations differently from other people, though. This may not just come from physical sensation but also from something heard on the radio, read in a magazine or seen on television. For those with severe health anxiety, the information will trigger feelings of hyper-awareness of the body which are very real and need to be taken very seriously.'</p> <p>Professor Salkovskis does not test his patients for the illness they think they have because the nature of health anxiety means that this almost certainly will not offer reassurance. Instead, they go through a series of behavioural experiments in which they will find out for themselves that they may be interpreting their symptoms of anxiety as a physical illness. 'For instance, someone may think there is something wrong with the glands in their neck, that their size is indicative of a serious disease, and repeatedly touch them to check. We would suggest that they may actually be causing the glands to become inflamed and/or enlarged because of this constant touching. Each case is different, though, so the cognitive therapy is, of course, personalised.'</p> <p>Melissa Woycechowksy, 32, is able to be objective about her hypochondria because she has, to a large extent, recovered from her health anxiety through psychiatry and courses of Prozac. She has set up a health-anxiety website, http://healthanxiety.com/, which offers support to other sufferers - an irony because there was a time when the internet fed and fuelled her health concerns - and she has featured in a number of articles about 'cyberchondria', which occurs when an individual surfs the net in a frenzy of health anxiety. 'I started spending more and more time on the net in an attempt to find out what kind of disease I had,' says Woycechowksy. 'I was having a lot of physical anxiety symptoms, couldn't sleep, and was sure I had a neurological disorder.' At her most extreme, she was absolutely terrified. 'I'd just sit in bed with my laptop computer, crying.'</p> <p>It seems that those who are severely concerned about their health have no common cause for their obsession. According to Professor Salkovskis, 'There are only guesses and theories. For instance, you may be preoccupied with the illness that someone you loved died of. Others seem to feel that they somehow deserve to have a serious illness, or it may be that they got more attention as a child when they were ill. Equally, it may be a reaction to stress or a feeling that it's more acceptable to be physically ill than mentally ill. Oddly enough, those who have been seriously ill, who you might expect to suffer from severe health anxiety, rarely seem to, and parents who have suffered from health anxiety don't seem to pass it on to their children.'</p> <p>For the average GP, who is trained to spot and treat those with genuine physical illness, dealing with someone suffering from hypochondrosis (or, in GP speak, 'the thick file' patient) is very difficult.

      "bodyText": "Having children has meant an awful lot of nervous flicking through the Family Health Tome. Mine always falls open at the 'M' pages (measles, meningitis and mumps) but I usually end up daring myself to have a random and prurient peek at the grisly photographs and descriptions of symptoms in the pages preceeding or beyond. Once I have diagnosed my child, I feel I am at leisure to find something deeply unpleasant with symptoms closely resembling the feelings and discomforts I have been suffering in silence while selflessly tending to my family's health needs. I think that most of us suffer from a degree of anxiety about our health, and we certainly recognise it in those we live with. My cold is my husband's flu and my father's every sore throat 'streptococcal', while my son gives me a list of serious ailments each day which he self-diagnoses with a pessimism which would rival the hypochondriac in Moli\u00e8re's Le Malade Imaginaire . For the majority of us, however, these feelings of anxiety about our bodies malfunctioning are replaced by another preoccupation soon enough. It is amazing, for instance, how quickly my son perks up when I inform him that his 'broken wrist' will prohibit him from playing PlayStation that day. And even when we take our health concerns as far as a trip to the doctor, most of us are reassured by their diagnosis or opinion and quickly move on to worrying about money or schools or our marriage instead. For some people, though, this isn't the case - these feelings of preoccupation with a disease or indeed any number of illnesses don't pass but grow and start to dominate the way they think about themselves, their body and their future. The persistence of this anxiety about health is what separates the 'worried well' from the hypochondriac. Sheila Roderiquez, 52, is often told that her feeling that she has ovarian cancer is 'only' her imagination. She has had three private investigative operations, countless tests and visited more than 20 doctors in England, France and Spain. Nothing has been found to be medically wrong with her, yet that does not reassure or stop her trying to find 'better' medical advice. The fear, anticipation and certainty of having an illness has taken over, costing her time and money and affecting the quality of her life. Her husband, Freddo, feels that this experience is marring their life almost as much as a physical illness 'because increasingly she lives like an invalid. I think I have probably gone along with it all too much, but every time she saw a new doctor I thought she might believe what they had to say. Certainly my son now feels that I should help her to get over her fears.' Professor Paul Salkovskis is the clinical director of the Centre for Anxiety Disorders at the Maudsley hospital and treats cases of 'persistent health anxiety' (a term which has less negative connotations then hypochondria) with cognitive-behavioural therapy. 'People get anxious about what is important to them, and of course health is very important to most people. Those with severe health anxiety seem to interpret their bodily variations differently from other people, though. This may not just come from physical sensation but also from something heard on the radio, read in a magazine or seen on television. For those with severe health anxiety, the information will trigger feelings of hyper-awareness of the body which are very real and need to be taken very seriously.' Professor Salkovskis does not test his patients for the illness they think they have because the nature of health anxiety means that this almost certainly will not offer reassurance. Instead, they go through a series of behavioural experiments in which they will find out for themselves that they may be interpreting their symptoms of anxiety as a physical illness. 'For instance, someone may think there is something wrong with the glands in their neck, that their size is indicative of a serious disease, and repeatedly touch them to check. We would suggest that they may actually be causing the glands to become inflamed and/or enlarged because of this constant touching. Each case is different, though, so the cognitive therapy is, of course, personalised.' Melissa Woycechowksy, 32, is able to be objective about her hypochondria because she has, to a large extent, recovered from her health anxiety through psychiatry and courses of Prozac. She has set up a health-anxiety website, http://healthanxiety.com/, which offers support to other sufferers - an irony because there was a time when the internet fed and fuelled her health concerns - and she has featured in a number of articles about 'cyberchondria', which occurs when an individual surfs the net in a frenzy of health anxiety. 'I started spending more and more time on the net in an attempt to find out what kind of disease I had,' says Woycechowksy. 'I was having a lot of physical anxiety symptoms, couldn't sleep, and was sure I had a neurological disorder.' At her most extreme, she was absolutely terrified. 'I'd just sit in bed with my laptop computer, crying.' It seems that those who are severely concerned about their health have no common cause for their obsession. According to Professor Salkovskis, 'There are only guesses and theories. For instance, you may be preoccupied with the illness that someone you loved died of. Others seem to feel that they somehow deserve to have a serious illness, or it may be that they got more attention as a child when they were ill. Equally, it may be a reaction to stress or a feeling that it's more acceptable to be physically ill than mentally ill. Oddly enough, those who have been seriously ill, who you might expect to suffer from severe health anxiety, rarely seem to, and parents who have suffered from health anxiety don't seem to pass it on to their children.' For the average GP, who is trained to spot and treat those with genuine physical illness, dealing with someone suffering from hypochondrosis (or, in GP speak, 'the thick file' patient) is very difficult. Helen Cartwright, a GP who works in a busy London practice, certainly finds herself wondering what to do when she looks at the computer and realises that the person in front of her has seen dozens of doctors about the same thing. 'You want them to go and get help, but as they believe so strongly that there is something wrong (often with their heart or stomach, in my experience), it is very difficult to convince someone to do that. Also - and I think that this is very important - just because they are suffering from hypochondrosis does not mean that there is definitely not something physically wrong with them.' And that really seems to be the crux of the matter - hypochondriacs want a certainty that they are 100 per cent well. But the truth is that there is no doctor on earth that can ever be completely, without a shadow of a doubt, certain about the health of a patient. For most patients, that slight uncertainty is something they live with and accept as part of life, but for the hypochondriac, this uncertainty is unacceptable and becomes a daily torment - a torment that can eventually only be relieved by specialist psychiatric help.

      "body": "<p>With the daffs in the garden trumpeting in the arrival of spring, it's time to examine the Taoist take on this joyous seasonal transfer. Go 'Brrrr!' and shake off the kidney-crunching cold of winter. Take your fists and use them to massage some warmth into your lower back, then relax while I talk you through the Taoist springtime schema. You have five vital organs: heart, lungs, spleen (including pancreas), kidneys and liver.</p> <p>During each of the five seasons (summer is split into early and late), a different organ is energetically predominant. Right now we're coming into liver time. It's no accident that your 'liver' is spelt the way it is. It's what gives you the oomph to slough off your inner wallflower, grab your adventure by the ears and live it to the full.</p> <p>Each of the vital organs is assigned different responsibilities in connection with your self-development. While your kidneys give you will power, your heart the power to love, your spleen the power to intellectualise and your lungs the power to create, your liver gives you the power to grow and take on new challenges. In this capacity (of self-renewal and, by extension, species renewal), it also gives you the drive to come out of hibernation, both literally and metaphorically, and interact with the external world - socialise, in other words. This is true all year round, but is more pronounced in spring, when nature invites you to partake one way or another in the mating game (and renewal of the species).</p> <p>However, being the season's predominant organ doesn't come without its drawbacks, vulnerability to climate being one. Spring is traditionally known as the windy season, when the winds of change blow through your system and stir the sap in your sacrum that it might rise through your spinal column to your brain and stimulate you to go out and make a difference to the scheme of things. Which is fine if your energy circuits are clear of blockages. But if - as it is in most cases in this polluted, stressful madhouse of a world we've created - your meridians are somewhat clogged with energetic debris caused by toxic build-up in the system, when the wind blows through it will activate those toxins and place strain on your liver.</p> <p>This is why it is often recommended to engage in detox activities at this time of year, one of the most effective being a four-day apple and spring-water fast, with honey as an optional add-on to the apples. If you opt for this route, lead into the fast gradually by cutting out alcohol, coffee, stimulants, meats and carbohydrates a couple of days prior, and do likewise in reverse on the way out, gradually reintroducing all the tasty stuff, rather than launching into a cheeseburger and chips for breakfast on the fifth day. (It has been known!)</p> <p>You can eat as many apples as you like, including the core, which is perfectly safe if eaten with the rest of the apple. You can choose any brand you like, but Granny Smiths tend to pack the most punch energetically. Be sure to drink ample water. You may experience headaches on the second day as the toxins start surfacing, so it's a good idea to arrange a soothing aromatic massage in the evening. As you may feel rather weak for the first two days, it might be best to begin on the weekend. By day three, your energy will have increased significantly, enabling you to bound into work annoyingly bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to put your sallow-faced colleagues to shame.</p> <p>Whether you plumb for this simple detox suggestion or something more elaborate such as the infamous 10-day brown-rice fast, or skip the whole idea altogether, it will be highly beneficial to invest in an acupuncture or shiatsu session for purposes of seasonal adjustment. More importantly, it is crucial you take up some form of daily, preferably morning, exercise regime.</p> <p>This is because the liver also governs your tendons and ligaments and therefore the flexibility of your joints and muscles. By upping the exercise ante, not only are you taking advantage of the liver's extra seasonal energy, thus maximising on muscle-toning possibilities, you are also helping to circulate the energy in your meridians and thus clear out the debris. Obviously the efficacy of this depends on both the kind of exercise you do and the way you do it. Huffing, puffing and straining at the weights in a sweaty gym will give you a temporary endorphin high but will not make your energy surge as much as, say, huffing, puffing and releasing your way through a sweaty power-yoga session, and definitely not as much as losing yourself in a concentrated chi-kung or t'ai-chi mess-about.</p> <p>But then again, if you relax and move from your centre, allowing your breath to flow uninterruptedly, smoothly and evenly, with your mind fully engaged in internal body awareness as you would in t'ai-chi, for example, any exercise will be of benefit, from cartwheeling to tossing the caber.</p> <p>If you can warm yourself into it slowly so as not to damage your muscles or joints, it is far more beneficial to do 30 to 60 minutes of exercise, preferably outside or near an open window, in the mornings, when the air is less polluted and the 'yang' daylight energy is most available, than in the evenings when the air is filthy from the day's traffic and your system is clogged by stress.</p> <p>And contrary to popular belief, it is correct, according to Oriental wisdom, to exercise in a structured way every day, not just three, four or five days a week, as Western exercise specialists often recommend. Exercise is really part of your daily hygiene and to skip a day, except when ill, exhausted or otherwise prevented, is a bit like going out without brushing your teeth: it won't kill you, but it's unpleasant.</p> <p>Finally, spend a few moments at the end of each day making the Taoist healing sound for the liver. Try it now. Take a deep breath and exhale making the sound, 'SSSHHHHHHHH!', imagining it as a jet of water steam cleaning your liver (under the ribs on your right) from within.

However, on a recent visit to the prime pork-producing areas of Spain, I gorged myself on sausages and Iberian ham and loin.</p> <p>This was my less glamorous, but more calorific, version of the DCOL rule - Doesn't Count On Location. We profess ourselves stunned every time another venerable Hollywood union (for 'venerable' read about three years plus) goes belly up, but it should be no surprise that they crash and burn with Groundhog Day monotony. For, every working day, the world's most beautiful people are paid vast sums to pretend to be other people having unparalleled sex with equally beautiful people pretending to be other people. They're emphatically not themselves (if they'd ever established a vague identity of their own in the first place). So, when the choicest metaphorical cuts of pork loin are offered up to them, in the most auspicious of circumstances, of course they're going to nibble. And in the midst of the mind-numbing tedium of a film set, it would be a saint who wouldn't wolf it down. But to then play the 'doesn't count' card is rather stretching the point. Yes, the provision for vegetarians in Extremadura left a little to be desired, but I could have got by; instead, I scoffed Percy Pig and his adorable friends. And they tasted good.</p> <p>Hollywood's dizzying relationship la ronde, the endless on-set flings - from Tom Cruise's alleged (and completely untrue, if his libel lawyers are reading this) dalliances with Penelope Cruz on Vanilla Sky to Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe's fling during the shooting of Proof of Life - are really just a ponced-up version of that most mundane of dalliances, the holiday romance. When we step out of the regimen of our own lives, we delight in assuming a different identity - the kind of person who performs karaoke versions of Burt Bacharach standards, and on occasion, has vigorous sex with virtual strangers - sometimes outdoors: the kind of person we'd ordinarily run to the hills to avoid. This is the DCOL rule at its purest.</p> <p>Yet complications ensue if one life starts to bleed into another. A friend of mine met a man while travelling, and, on the briefest of acquaintance, convinced herself that this was The Real Thing, inviting him back home to live with her. He abandoned his job, his family, his friends and his life; but on seeing him arrive at the airport, she realised she'd made a terrible mistake - he was wearing terrible clothes, and his hair was just awful.

      "bodyText": "I have been a vegetarian - oh, all right then, a non red-meat eater, if you must nitpick - for close on 20 years. However, on a recent visit to the prime pork-producing areas of Spain, I gorged myself on sausages and Iberian ham and loin. This was my less glamorous, but more calorific, version of the DCOL rule - Doesn't Count On Location. We profess ourselves stunned every time another venerable Hollywood union (for 'venerable' read about three years plus) goes belly up, but it should be no surprise that they crash and burn with Groundhog Day monotony. For, every working day, the world's most beautiful people are paid vast sums to pretend to be other people having unparalleled sex with equally beautiful people pretending to be other people. They're emphatically not themselves (if they'd ever established a vague identity of their own in the first place). So, when the choicest metaphorical cuts of pork loin are offered up to them, in the most auspicious of circumstances, of course they're going to nibble. And in the midst of the mind-numbing tedium of a film set, it would be a saint who wouldn't wolf it down. But to then play the 'doesn't count' card is rather stretching the point. Yes, the provision for vegetarians in Extremadura left a little to be desired, but I could have got by; instead, I scoffed Percy Pig and his adorable friends. And they tasted good. Hollywood's dizzying relationship la ronde, the endless on-set flings - from Tom Cruise's alleged (and completely untrue, if his libel lawyers are reading this) dalliances with Penelope Cruz on Vanilla Sky to Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe's fling during the shooting of Proof of Life - are really just a ponced-up version of that most mundane of dalliances, the holiday romance. When we step out of the regimen of our own lives, we delight in assuming a different identity - the kind of person who performs karaoke versions of Burt Bacharach standards, and on occasion, has vigorous sex with virtual strangers - sometimes outdoors: the kind of person we'd ordinarily run to the hills to avoid. This is the DCOL rule at its purest. Yet complications ensue if one life starts to bleed into another. A friend of mine met a man while travelling, and, on the briefest of acquaintance, convinced herself that this was The Real Thing, inviting him back home to live with her. He abandoned his job, his family, his friends and his life; but on seeing him arrive at the airport, she realised she'd made a terrible mistake - he was wearing terrible clothes, and his hair was just awful. In short, he was irredeemably Australian. He was sent packing on the next return flight, the victim of a rare case of DCOL in reverse: Counted On Location, Sure As Hell Didn't Count At Home. There are many variations on DCOL doublethink.

      "body": "<p>Alexander McQueen describes the end of his tumultuous four-and-a-half-year reign as head designer at the august House of Givenchy with an almost romantic analogy: 'It was like having a boyfriend that you know you have to break up with - the only difference with this relationship was that I didn't feel bad about doing it.' The jilted 'boyfriend' in McQueen's scenario is none other than fashion kingpin Bernard Arnault, the high-flying chairman and CEO of the \u00a327bn luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton), which counts among its many holdings Givenchy, Christian Dior, Celine, Loewe, Pucci, Kenzo, Christian Lacroix, Louis Vuitton and Donna Karan.</p> <p>And the inevitable new boyfriend waiting in the wings, the one McQueen was flirting with all last summer? That would be Tom Ford, creative director of the Gucci Group, who along with Domenico De Sole, Gucci's CEO, orchestrated one of the most controversial coups in recent fashion history by poaching McQueen from Arnault's star-studded stable of designers.</p> <p>McQueen is the fashion community's very own Johnny Rotten: a foul-mouthed loud mouth who once wrote 'I am a cunt' in the lining of a jacket destined for the Prince of Wales, once titled a runway show 'Highland Rape' (featuring clothes accessorised with what appeared to be tampon strings), and once sent an amputee down the runway.</p> <p>In other words, McQueen knows how to garner headlines and loves few things more than, as he says, 'winding up' journalists. Over the years, he has waxed poetic about his bouts with drugs and publicly insulted Madonna, and Posh and Becks. ('This man is vainer than the veins running through my dick, I swear,' McQueen once said of Becks. 'And that's vain.')</p> <p>He has also let loose with the kinds of ostensibly off-the-cuff quips virtually guaranteed to get him quoted - referring to Cherie Blair as 'cheesy' after meeting her at a reception at 10 Downing Street. Or turning down an invitation from the Queen to a reception for the emperor of Japan at Buckingham Palace: 'I just couldn't be bothered.'</p> <p>If McQueen rarely misses an opportunity to thumb his nose at the establishment in general, he is particularly vitriolic when it comes to the LVMH establishment. Never mind that Arnault presented him with a reported \u00a31.5m annual paycheque, an apartment on the Place de Vosges, and a Mercedes sedan and driver to squire him around Paris. Of his tenure at Givenchy, a decidedly melodramatic McQueen claims, 'It was worse than being a gladiator.'</p> <p>McQueen isn't the first enfant terrible to have bitten the hand that fed him so well. Nor is he the first to have made the ladies in the little gold chairs lining the catwalk squirm. Vivienne Westwood once sent models down her runway wearing sheer stockings adorned with drawings of erect phalluses. And Jean Paul Gaultier, who installed pissoirs as dressing rooms in his Paris boutique, sent a parade of musclemen down his runway - wearing opera gloves and elaborate evening gowns. Thirty years back, even Yves Saint Laurent caused a scandale when he asked Jeanloup Sieff to photograph him nude for an ad campaign.</p> <p>Such shock tactics work, of course, when wedded to extraordinary talent. Which, love him or hate him, McQueen has. Though not one to frighten the horses himself, Paul Smith has gone on record as an unabashed McQueen admirer: 'There are so many stylists in this business posing as designers. There are very few real designers who have a real craft, which is to say a sense of cut, proportion and tailoring. Alexander has it.'</p> <p>As for the rest of the British fashion industry, well, it has been predictably awed by the noisy East Ender whose cockney accent is so glottal it sometimes sounds as though he has a speech impediment. If nothing else, runways immersed in oil and models encircled by flames make great copy. Meaning that McQueen's shows, consistently staged in eerily lit warehouses miles away from the tents in South Kensington, became the sine qua non of London Fashion Week. Not everyone is dazzled, of course. 'His only usefulness is a measure of zero talent,' said Westwood. A 'talentless upstart' offered Saint Laurent, whose business partner, Pierre Berg\u00e9, somewhat presciently added that in his opinion McQueen was 'completely miscast' at Givenchy.</p> <p>The timing of McQueen's defection to Gucci couldn't have been more inopportune for LVMH, because this season, after a rollercoaster series of hit-and-miss shows, the 31-year-old designer drew rave reviews for his spring 2001 collections for both Givenchy in Paris and his own label in London. 'If one person can really be said to claim the season it was Alexander McQueen,' wrote Cathy Horyn, fashion reporter for The New York Times. 'With his own collection in London, and the one he showed a couple of weeks later in Paris for Givenchy, Mr McQueen proved with his erotic blend of masculine tailoring and feminine underpinnings that he supremely gets this mojo moment.'</p> <p>The son of a cab driver - the youngest of six children - Lee Alexander McQueen was born in the heart of London's East End. His mother Joyce has traced family's roots back to the 16th century, and those roots are a theme McQueen constantly brings up in his life and work, claiming, 'Every part of my background comes from something, be it the Jacobites or the Huguenots.'</p> <p>McQueen realised he was gay on a family holiday at Pontins - where he won the 'Prince of Pontins' beauty competition. He did not publicly announce his homosexuality until he was 18, however, for fear of how his family would react - particularly his brother Michael, now a cab driver, and his father Ronald, who is still something of an off-limits subject.</p> <p>'There's a side of my life, my early childhood, I wish to forget about,' says McQueen, darkly. 'I was born to some parts of aggression, but maybe it made me stronger...'</p> <p>Although he and his father 'now have a mutual respect and understanding for one another', it is significant that the only time McQueen senior was ever spotted at one of his son's fashion shows was the time he dropped his wife off, and then drove away.</p> <p>Leaving school at 16, McQueen enrolled at a technical college, earning pocket money by clearing beer mugs. Despite the taunts of his brother and father, he desperately wanted to go to art school, but after watching a 1986 television programme about the shortage of tailor's apprentices he decided to go knocking on a few Savile Row doors. Anderson &amp; Sheppard was one of the first, and instantly he was offered a job - and the opportunity to learn bespoke tailoring from the bottom. To alleviate the 'boredom' of sitting on a bench padding labels, he wrote obscene messages and drew penises in the interlinings of jackets. After two years, he moved to Gieves &amp; Hawkes, then to theatrical tailors Angels &amp; Berman, where he learned '16th-century pattern-cutting and stuff like that'. He took those skills along to Koji Tatsuno, a designer, then backed by Yohji Yamamoto.</p> <p>After Tatsuno, McQueen bought a one-way ticket to Milan, where Romeo Gigli, his hero at the time, offered him a job as a pattern cutter. In 1989, he returned to London and applied for a teaching post at Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design. Though turned down for the post, he was offered a place in the school's postgraduate course, which he accepted - thanks to a \u00a34,000 loan from his beloved Auntie Renee. Isabella Blow, the eccentric great-granddaughter of Sir Jock Delves Broughton - who's life was portrayed in White Mischief - happened to be in the front row of McQueen's 1993 degree show. Now the Sunday Times 's style director, Blow was so impressed she not only bought the entire collection but became McQueen's aristocratic patronne -cum-unofficial publicist.</p> <p>Within three years, McQueen was being mentioned in the same breath as Damien Hirst and Oasis. This must have struck McQueen as slightly surreal, considering that it hadn't been too long since he came off the dole and secured a modest manufacturing and distribution deal to launch his label.</p> <p>It was in 1996, the year McQueen was named British designer of the year, that Bernard Arnault first took a serious interest in him. Arnault had John Galliano, the son of a London plumber, installed at the helm of Givenchy, but he was eager to move Galliano to Dior to replace Gianfranco Ferre. Aside from the fact that McQueen obviously knew how to calculate the rise of an inseam - and, like Hubert de Givenchy, had an eye for structure - Arnault was impressed by the designer's talent for 'converting press into commerce', as McQueen once put it.</p> <p>McQueen vividly remembers the call he got from LVMH's then-director general Daniel Piette asking if he wanted the job at Givenchy. At the time, he was working out of a studio in London's Hoxton Square and living in a tiny room cordoned off from the main space by a curtain. The call came in the morning, and McQueen was in bed with his boyfriend. 'I thought, \"Oh, please. I'm not designing a bloody football for Louis Vuitton,\"' recalls McQueen. 'And then I went to the toilet to have a think about it. When nothing came out, I got back on the telephone and said, \"All right then.\" I was very blas\u00e9 about it. It took a while to sink in.' McQueen signed a two-year contract in November 1996 (followed by a three-year contract in 1998). LVMH also offered to buy a stake in his company, but McQueen refused, on the advice of Blow. 'I said, \"They must not buy one share in your company,\"' recalls Blow.</p> <p>As soon as the first funds were wired to his bank, McQueen bought a small terraced house in Islington, north London. LVMH, meanwhile, messengered over caviare and champagne. But McQueen was not impressed - 'I hate champagne' - the moment did have resonance: 'I thought, all this time I've been worrying about being homeless and freaking out about not being able to feed myself, and it was just, like, instantaneous.'</p> <p>McQueen's disaffection with the house best known for dressing Audrey Hepburn was almost as instantaneous - beginning the moment his debut Givenchy Haute Couture collection was disappointingly received in 1997. Though wounded by the reviews, McQueen refused to take the blame. 'I had no support from the French,' he says . 'I'd design, they'd change the whole thing, and then the press would give me the flak for it. It was a case of too many cooks. Every time I'd be doing what I was doing, they'd have a different idea instead of letting me stick to my path, [my] illusion. You have to stick to that illusion, then it becomes identifiable especially for a house that did not have an image apart from Audrey Hepburn. I was never given that chance.'</p> <p>Unlike Galliano - or le petit monsieur , as he has come to be known - who became friends with Arnault's wife and spent frequent weekends at the couple's Saint-Tropez villa, McQueen never made an attempt to immerse himself in French life. He refused to learn the language and crowed over the fact that he had not made a single French friend.</p> <p>By the beginning of the Paris pr t-\u00e0-porter last October, rumours of McQueen's imminent defection from Givenchy were rampant - perhaps because it made sense. After the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent perfume and pr t-\u00e0-porter, Ford and De Sole made no secret that they were looking for talent to back. As De Sole teasingly told Time in May, 'There are good opportunities. There are companies out there that can be bought. But I do have a limit. I have $2.5bn [\u00a31.7bn].'</p> <p>This, compounded with the persistent rumour that Ford would be giving up Gucci to concentrate on Yves Saint Laurent, only fired up the fashion gossips more. Of course, many of the rumours about McQueen were fuelled by the master provocateur himself, who had been photographed in New York partying at the opening of the Hudson hotel wearing a double-G Gucci fedora.</p> <p>For those who missed that moment, McQueen made his feelings unmistakably clear in an interview published in Arena. 'I asked to leave [Givenchy] in January and they said, \"No, we can't let you leave.\" And I said, \"Well in that case you're just going to let me do my fucking job...\" Otherwise it's going to be the worst year. You know, \"Fire me!\", 'cos that's what I wanted anyway.'</p> <p>And yet, true to unpredictable form, the Givenchy show that McQueen presented in the midst of all the rancour was so universally deemed his strongest to date that few picked up on the fact that the designer's obligatory appearance on the runway at the end of the show was so curt. 'Oh God, yeah,' snorts McQueen. 'I already knew! Why do you think I didn't walk the whole length?'</p> <p>Though Karl Lagerfeld is no stranger to firing off the occasional barb, even he raises an eyebrow over McQueen's public displays of contempt for LVMH: 'I am not sure he did it in a nice way as far as Mr Arnault, who was always very nice and supportive of him in interviews, is concerned.' In Lagerfeld's opinion, however, the chances of the liaison between McQueen and Arnault turning out better than it did weren't good: 'I think the spirit of French couture and his very special view of fashion - nearer to Damien Hirst than to Givenchy - were not made to be matched.'</p> <p>Azzedine Ala\u00efa doesn't agree: 'I respect McQueen for the English eccentricity he instilled in Parisian fashion... He was innocent enough to design clothes that were spectacular and unwearable. I think it's better that he designs his own line, because Givenchy wasn't for him. It didn't suit his character.'</p> <p>Although Arnault and De Sole had been waging a war of supremacy for almost two years, relations between the two titans had been reasonably amicable until early 1999, when Arnault suddenly launched a \u00a35.9bn takeover bid for the Gucci Group. To fend him off, De Sole and Ford brought in a white knight, Fran\u00e7oise Pinault, whose company, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR), bought 42 per cent of the Gucci group for \u00a32bn - thereby thwarting Arnault's plan to count Gucci among the notches in his belt.</p> <p>Even if the script had been written in Hollywood, the McQueen deal could not have been more gripping. On 27 November, Arnault filed a request for the courts to cancel the Gucci-PPR alliance. On 29 November, LVMH filed an official complaint with the US Securities Exchange Commission. The same day, Gucci announced it was going to file a criminal defamation suit against LVMH. On 30 November, LVMH announced it would countersue for defamation. And on 2 December, while the legal papers were flying, McQueen quietly got into bed with Ford and De Sole.</p> <p>The Gucci-McQueen deal is no small blow to Arnault. LVMH has been the unrivalled leader in the luxury goods market - snagging such star talents as Galliano for Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton and Hedi Slimane for Christian Dior menswear. But with the defection of McQueen, Arnault's boast of his pioneering method of putting 'new wine into old bottles' suddenly seems a bit more complicated. Arnault may also have to revise one of his favourite refrains, the one about how comparing Gucci to LVMH is like comparing a start-up company to Microsoft.</p> <p>It is four days after the news was announced, and I am sitting in McQueen's office near Islington. There are 11 months remaining in his contract with LVMH, a detail that is keeping the self-described 'loudmouth' uncharacteristically mum. Even so, his ever-present publicist, Amy Witton, wonders if I'd mind signing a confidentiality agreement.</p> <p>A mixture of fatigue and relief is etched across McQueen's face as he slumps in a chair and pats his body for a Marlboro Light. But then yesterday he was in Paris dealing with the fallout at LVMH. And last night was spent drinking caipirinhas at the Htel Costes with Blow and Marie De Petit Thoars, a descendant of Marie Antoinette's. 'It was a major deal,' he explains flatly. 'I wanted to get it signed quick because of the stress it was causing.'</p> <p>Cleared of all the congratulatory bouquets, his office appears relatively unaffected by the news. Aside from the ringing telephones, the only interruption is the arrival of McQueen's live-in-lover George Forsyth, a 24-year-old documentary film maker who freelances in advertising - here to accompany McQueen to the dentist. Since meeting nine months ago, the two have been inseparable. Last summer, they were married in Ibiza on a yacht owned by the prince of Gambia, an acquaintance of their friend Kate Moss, who played bridesmaid at the ceremony, which was attended by music producer Nellee Hooper and Jude Law and Sadie Frost.</p> <p>Sitting on a table is a box filled with straw and Forsyth's latest acquisition, a tortoise named Billy. Propped against a wall are seven framed photographs by Joel-Peter Witkin - one a birthday present to McQueen from Elton John and David Furnish. Witkin served as the inspiration for the finale of McQueen's spring/summer 2001 show: a model, nude save for a gas mask, brought out in a glass box filled with thousands of fluttering moths, which escaped when the glass was shattered.</p> <p>Although the price Gucci paid McQueen for 51 per cent of his company has not been disclosed, the word on the street is \u00a354m. De Sole insists that number is not accurate, but whatever the amount, Gucci has obviously made a serious commitment to a designer whose collections have featured clothes crawling with live locusts. Ten new stores are allegedly in the offing, and McQueen has been promised his own 'house' in Paris by January 2002, making him the first British designer since Charles Worth to have his own name on a couture collection. 'That was part of the deal,' says McQueen. 'I don't think Arnault would ever have given me that, 'cos he hasn't given John [Galliano] it.' There is also talk of a bespoke business for men.</p> <p>In all of this, McQueen has De Sole's backing. 'We will support the business, we will provide the business expertise, but the one thing that is important is that Alexander must have his creative independence,' says De Sole. 'The question that I had to ask myself - because it's my job - is does he really have the power and the talent to turn the Alexander McQueen label into a global brand? I think he does; otherwise I could not have done the deal, basically.'</p> <p>Tom Ford, co-engineer of the coup d'\u00e9tat, echoes the sentiment: 'For me there is a poetic quality to Lee's work. He is a true artist, albeit an artist with real commercial savvy.' 'Lee', not surprisingly, shares his new owners' confidence in his chances of becoming a contender at cash registers around the world. 'I see [Alexander McQueen] as a luxury-goods label, very modern, very 21st- century,' says McQueen '[But] it doesn't have to be a global brand to the point of Calvin Klein underwear or billboards.'</p> <p>'I don't like to admit I'm a nice person,' says McQueen. 'But I try to please everyone. I can't, but I try.' McQueen also claims to be quite shy. 'I don't like standing out in a crowd. I clam up. I have panic attacks. What's the word when you can't take praise from anyone? Modest. Yeah. I'm extremely modest.' This from the designer who once had the breathtaking arrogance to declare, 'John [Galliano] was the 80s, and I am the 90s.'</p> <p>'People think he's aggressive, but of course the aggression comes from the vulnerability,' says Elton John. 'He does strike out, but that's all about insecurity. [John] Lennon was the same.'</p> <p>'There's beauty in anger,' says McQueen 'Anger for me is a passion. If you don't have passion for something, you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. How can you move something forward, if you are not confrontational? There comes a point where you just have to block off commercialism and do it from the heart. Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren may sell 2,000 pieces of a two-piece suit; I may only sell five of one of my suits. But one of my pieces will count for 1,000.' Again: modest?</p> <p>On the other hand, there are reports that McQueen can be generous and compassionate. One of his friends, the artist Sam Taylor-Wood, recalls the package of clothes McQueen sent after her recovery from breast cancer. And according to Susannah Frankel, his use of a disabled model on the runway wasn't what it seemed. 'Everyone thought, Oh my God, he's going to turn this into a big freak show. But he masked it completely, so when she came out nobody knew. I've met Aimee Mullins [the model]; that's what she's always wanted to do, walk on the runway.'</p> <p>Although McQueen is keen to point out he does not, like so many designers, 'court celebrities', he is fond of Gwyneth Paltrow, who attended his spring 2001 show in London. The two met last summer in New York while McQueen, his trusty publicist Witton, and Katy England, his creative director, were filming an eyewear campaign. 'The way I remember it, I had her assistant's number,' says Witton. 'So [we] thought, \"Oh, wouldn't it be nice if they met up.\" I said, \"Yeah, they're at the Mercer Hotel.\" So Katy said, \"Why doesn't she come to the Mercer?'\" Paltrow did. The three had dinner, discussing among other things the possibility of a collaboration with photographer Nick Knight.</p> <p>'I like Gwyneth,' says McQueen. 'She's a sweet girl, a typical American blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl... Done well in the movie industry. But I want to pull her apart and put her back together the way I see fit. I like to take people's characters out of themselves.'</p> <p>One other niggling detail guaranteed to rankle those with a mind for logic is that despite McQueen's much-ballyhooed resolve not to sell a stake in his own company to LVMH, in April he proposed the idea to Marianne Tessler, the president of Givenchy. But neither Tessler nor Arnault seemed particularly interested, according to McQueen: 'They said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" And nothing happened.'</p> <p>A month later, Isabella Blow happened to be seated next to Tom Ford at a dinner in London. 'I said, \"Oh, you should look at Alexander,\"' recalls Blow. '\"He might be someone interesting for you to buy.\" And [Ford] said, \"Do you think so? I quite fancy him.\" And I said, \"So do I!\" And he said, \"Well, look, get him to ring me tomorrow.\" So I rang [McQueen] and said, \"Get your arse out of bed and ring Tom Ford - he fancies you.\" He said, \"No he doesn't.\" I said, \"Yes, he does. It could be what you need.\"'</p> <p>'Izzy told me that [Ford] found me sexy, blah, blah, blah,' says McQueen, 'like you do when you're interested in meeting someone.' (For his part, Ford says, 'Lee looks fierce in photos, but in real life he is a marshmallow - adorable, charming and kind.')</p> <p>Between May and October, a flurry of telephone calls took place between Ford and McQueen, and then early in October the two had dinner at The Ivy. As McQueen tells it, the vibe between them was electric. 'We had Twiggy in front of us and Charles Saatchi behind us, and here we were, these two men sitting at this table, glowing. We were the centre of attention, not because of who we were but because of the strange combination. But we didn't talk about fashion. We talked about our lives, our partners, everything we thought we wouldn't talk about.' The evening was obviously a success. As Richard Buckley, Ford's partner of more than 10 years, remarks, 'Tom would say, \"I'm going out to dinner with Alexander, and you can't come!\" So I knew they were up to something.'</p> <p>Back in May, at a party for Helmut Newton at the Monte Carlo Beach Hotel, McQueen had made himself known to De Sole, who was there with his wife. Despite the two men's somewhat impenetrable accents, they hit it off - with De Sole suggesting they meet up in London. In the middle of October, McQueen decided to warn Tessler that he was in negotiations with Gucci. 'I liked her. That's why I did tell her,' he says. 'I felt like I owed them that. [But] she didn't start fluffing around.' By the time Tessler did start 'fluffing around', it was too late.</p> <p>In the days leading up to the 2 December signing, McQueen managed to avoid most of Tessler's calls. He also had his assistant cancel a dinner scheduled for 1 December in London with Tessler and LVMH president Yves Carcelle. He was certain they were going to offer to back his company if he would agree to stay at Givenchy. But now that Gucci had come through... So he stayed at home, watched TV and had, as he says, 'mad sex'.</p> <p>The following afternoon, McQueen, Forsyth and Witton took a taxi to the Gucci office on Grafton Street. The signing took considerably longer than the designer had anticipated. After the 10th page, he turned to his lawyer and whispered, 'What is this?' It was then that he found out that he wasn't signing a binding agreement, but the actual contract in its entirety. After a celebration of mineral water and a couple of cans of Coke - 'We were working,' says De Sole - McQueen and company walked out in such a daze that on their way to Maison Bertaux, McQueen's favourite Soho patisserie, they got lost.</p> <p>By Monday, the news was official. As the press release was announced, the Gucci Group had signed a definitive agreement to acquire 51 per cent of the luxury designer label Alexander McQueen for an undisclosed price, with the intention of turning the label into a global megabrand.</p> <p>'This relationship,' it read, 'will become exclusive upon the expiry in October 2001 of his other current creative responsibilities' - pointedly alluding to the remaining months of McQueen's contract with LVMH. The switchboards at the offices of Alexander McQueen in London and Givenchy in Paris were jammed. A terse statement was hurriedly issued by LVMH. Since LVMH had not backed McQueen's own company, the way that it had backed those of John Galliano, Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs, it was 'normal that Mr McQueen should seek financing for his tiny business.' Of all the press McQueen received after the deal, it was the word tiny that most rankled.</p> <p>De Sole, the victor, continued to insist that the timing was completely coincidental. 'The week before the deal, you have to understand, was something pretty disgusting - what they did at LVMH,' he says. 'But it is something we did not control. We were working with Alexander, everything was proceeding, we had already planned to finish that weekend, and then that happened. We just stayed on course. This is nothing to do with our rivalry with LVMH. The fact that Alexander was at Givenchy was totally irrelevant. Some people in fashion were asking me if this was done against LVMH. This was silly. We are business people.'</p> <p>One of the more subversive elements of McQueen's character is that he, too, is something of a businessman. In 1997, for example, he changed the title of his spring '98 show at the last minute - from 'Golden Showers' to 'Untitled' - concerned that American Express, his sponsor, might take offence. The company has sponsored his shows ever since. 'You strive to get that equilibrium and you try to crack that perfect ideal of creativity and commercialism.' says McQueen, in a rare burst of clarity. Still, he insists, it isn't money that fuels him. 'I believe in my integrity,' he says, 'And I believe the sole purpose of fashion is to create and not accumulate.'</p> <p>This does not quite tally with some of his tastes. As friends will attest, 'Lee loves a label.' At the same time, he does not drive a car and still jokes about the one time he flew on a private plane, when Arnault took him back to London on the LVMH jet after the last Givenchy pr t-\u00e0-porter show. 'I felt like Joan Collins,' giggles McQueen, 'like I should have had a fox round my neck.'</p> <p>Joan Collins is one of McQueen's most loyal fans. 'I used to think Saint Laurent was the best cutter,' she declares, 'but [McQueen] cuts better than anyone I can think of. I wore an outfit of his last night to a party - a circular skirt with a huge bird embroidered on it and a jacket edged in fake monkey fur - and everyone was going, \"Whose is that?\" \"God it's fabulous!\"'</p> <p>'I don't need any more money in my life,' says McQueen, who had a dinner date with Collins at The Ivy that Wednesday. 'I'm in fashion 'cos I love it. I needed to find a way to get that love back.'</p> <p>Which brings us to Didier, the driver whom McQueen inherited from Hubert de Givenchy. 'In all the years I worked there, he never said one word to me,' says McQueen. 'Whether I'd had bad reviews or I'd be crying my eyes out after a terrible row with my boyfriend, he'd just sit there. And he spoke perfect English! I was really hurt by that.' Apparently so, because suddenly McQueen tilts his head back to hide the tears that have welled up in his eyes.</p> <p>'I was thinking on the way to Charles de Gaulle last night - should I say something to him? In the end, I felt like I should have been driving him! It's, like, that was the mentality I had to deal with. I felt totally isolated. I thought, \"What am I doing working my fucking arse off for this company?\" It still drives me mad thinking about it. But it's fine\u0085 Maybe I'll change the way LVMH thinks. Maybe they'll start to treat people a bit more like human beings.'</p> <p>Who knows whether De Sole will continue to be a beneficent boss? Oe whether Ford, the ferocious perfectionist, will really stand back while the incorrigible McQueen does what he does? Or whether McQueen's image can actually be marketed for the mainstream in the way Gucci's has? And, if so, whether he'll like the result? As his friend Sam Gainsbury says, 'He could jack it all in tomorrow and I wouldn't be surprised.'</p> <p>\u0095 This article was originally published in the March 2001 issue of Talk magazine.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alexander McQueen describes the end of his tumultuous four-and-a-half-year reign as head designer at the august House of Givenchy with an almost romantic analogy: 'It was like having a boyfriend that you know you have to break up with - the only difference with this relationship was that I didn't feel bad about doing it.' The jilted 'boyfriend' in McQueen's scenario is none other than fashion kingpin Bernard Arnault, the high-flying chairman and CEO of the \u00a327bn luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton), which counts among its many holdings Givenchy, Christian Dior, Celine, Loewe, Pucci, Kenzo, Christian Lacroix, Louis Vuitton and Donna Karan. And the inevitable new boyfriend waiting in the wings, the one McQueen was flirting with all last summer? That would be Tom Ford, creative director of the Gucci Group, who along with Domenico De Sole, Gucci's CEO, orchestrated one of the most controversial coups in recent fashion history by poaching McQueen from Arnault's star-studded stable of designers. McQueen is the fashion community's very own Johnny Rotten: a foul-mouthed loud mouth who once wrote 'I am a cunt' in the lining of a jacket destined for the Prince of Wales, once titled a runway show 'Highland Rape' (featuring clothes accessorised with what appeared to be tampon strings), and once sent an amputee down the runway. In other words, McQueen knows how to garner headlines and loves few things more than, as he says, 'winding up' journalists. Over the years, he has waxed poetic about his bouts with drugs and publicly insulted Madonna, and Posh and Becks. ('This man is vainer than the veins running through my dick, I swear,' McQueen once said of Becks. 'And that's vain.') He has also let loose with the kinds of ostensibly off-the-cuff quips virtually guaranteed to get him quoted - referring to Cherie Blair as 'cheesy' after meeting her at a reception at 10 Downing Street. Or turning down an invitation from the Queen to a reception for the emperor of Japan at Buckingham Palace: 'I just couldn't be bothered.' If McQueen rarely misses an opportunity to thumb his nose at the establishment in general, he is particularly vitriolic when it comes to the LVMH establishment. Never mind that Arnault presented him with a reported \u00a31.5m annual paycheque, an apartment on the Place de Vosges, and a Mercedes sedan and driver to squire him around Paris. Of his tenure at Givenchy, a decidedly melodramatic McQueen claims, 'It was worse than being a gladiator.' McQueen isn't the first enfant terrible to have bitten the hand that fed him so well. Nor is he the first to have made the ladies in the little gold chairs lining the catwalk squirm. Vivienne Westwood once sent models down her runway wearing sheer stockings adorned with drawings of erect phalluses. And Jean Paul Gaultier, who installed pissoirs as dressing rooms in his Paris boutique, sent a parade of musclemen down his runway - wearing opera gloves and elaborate evening gowns. Thirty years back, even Yves Saint Laurent caused a scandale when he asked Jeanloup Sieff to photograph him nude for an ad campaign. Such shock tactics work, of course, when wedded to extraordinary talent. Which, love him or hate him, McQueen has. Though not one to frighten the horses himself, Paul Smith has gone on record as an unabashed McQueen admirer: 'There are so many stylists in this business posing as designers. There are very few real designers who have a real craft, which is to say a sense of cut, proportion and tailoring. Alexander has it.' As for the rest of the British fashion industry, well, it has been predictably awed by the noisy East Ender whose cockney accent is so glottal it sometimes sounds as though he has a speech impediment. If nothing else, runways immersed in oil and models encircled by flames make great copy. Meaning that McQueen's shows, consistently staged in eerily lit warehouses miles away from the tents in South Kensington, became the sine qua non of London Fashion Week. Not everyone is dazzled, of course. 'His only usefulness is a measure of zero talent,' said Westwood. A 'talentless upstart' offered Saint Laurent, whose business partner, Pierre Berg\u00e9, somewhat presciently added that in his opinion McQueen was 'completely miscast' at Givenchy. The timing of McQueen's defection to Gucci couldn't have been more inopportune for LVMH, because this season, after a rollercoaster series of hit-and-miss shows, the 31-year-old designer drew rave reviews for his spring 2001 collections for both Givenchy in Paris and his own label in London. 'If one person can really be said to claim the season it was Alexander McQueen,' wrote Cathy Horyn, fashion reporter for The New York Times. 'With his own collection in London, and the one he showed a couple of weeks later in Paris for Givenchy, Mr McQueen proved with his erotic blend of masculine tailoring and feminine underpinnings that he supremely gets this mojo moment.' The son of a cab driver - the youngest of six children - Lee Alexander McQueen was born in the heart of London's East End. His mother Joyce has traced family's roots back to the 16th century, and those roots are a theme McQueen constantly brings up in his life and work, claiming, 'Every part of my background comes from something, be it the Jacobites or the Huguenots.' McQueen realised he was gay on a family holiday at Pontins - where he won the 'Prince of Pontins' beauty competition. He did not publicly announce his homosexuality until he was 18, however, for fear of how his family would react - particularly his brother Michael, now a cab driver, and his father Ronald, who is still something of an off-limits subject. 'There's a side of my life, my early childhood, I wish to forget about,' says McQueen, darkly. 'I was born to some parts of aggression, but maybe it made me stronger...' Although he and his father 'now have a mutual respect and understanding for one another', it is significant that the only time McQueen senior was ever spotted at one of his son's fashion shows was the time he dropped his wife off, and then drove away. Leaving school at 16, McQueen enrolled at a technical college, earning pocket money by clearing beer mugs. Despite the taunts of his brother and father, he desperately wanted to go to art school, but after watching a 1986 television programme about the shortage of tailor's apprentices he decided to go knocking on a few Savile Row doors. Anderson &amp; Sheppard was one of the first, and instantly he was offered a job - and the opportunity to learn bespoke tailoring from the bottom. To alleviate the 'boredom' of sitting on a bench padding labels, he wrote obscene messages and drew penises in the interlinings of jackets. After two years, he moved to Gieves &amp; Hawkes, then to theatrical tailors Angels &amp; Berman, where he learned '16th-century pattern-cutting and stuff like that'. He took those skills along to Koji Tatsuno, a designer, then backed by Yohji Yamamoto. After Tatsuno, McQueen bought a one-way ticket to Milan, where Romeo Gigli, his hero at the time, offered him a job as a pattern cutter. In 1989, he returned to London and applied for a teaching post at Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design. Though turned down for the post, he was offered a place in the school's postgraduate course, which he accepted - thanks to a \u00a34,000 loan from his beloved Auntie Renee. Isabella Blow, the eccentric great-granddaughter of Sir Jock Delves Broughton - who's life was portrayed in White Mischief - happened to be in the front row of McQueen's 1993 degree show. Now the Sunday Times 's style director, Blow was so impressed she not only bought the entire collection but became McQueen's aristocratic patronne -cum-unofficial publicist. Within three years, McQueen was being mentioned in the same breath as Damien Hirst and Oasis. This must have struck McQueen as slightly surreal, considering that it hadn't been too long since he came off the dole and secured a modest manufacturing and distribution deal to launch his label. It was in 1996, the year McQueen was named British designer of the year, that Bernard Arnault first took a serious interest in him. Arnault had John Galliano, the son of a London plumber, installed at the helm of Givenchy, but he was eager to move Galliano to Dior to replace Gianfranco Ferre. Aside from the fact that McQueen obviously knew how to calculate the rise of an inseam - and, like Hubert de Givenchy, had an eye for structure - Arnault was impressed by the designer's talent for 'converting press into commerce', as McQueen once put it. McQueen vividly remembers the call he got from LVMH's then-director general Daniel Piette asking if he wanted the job at Givenchy. At the time, he was working out of a studio in London's Hoxton Square and living in a tiny room cordoned off from the main space by a curtain. The call came in the morning, and McQueen was in bed with his boyfriend. 'I thought, \"Oh, please. I'm not designing a bloody football for Louis Vuitton,\"' recalls McQueen. 'And then I went to the toilet to have a think about it. When nothing came out, I got back on the telephone and said, \"All right then.\" I was very blas\u00e9 about it. It took a while to sink in.' McQueen signed a two-year contract in November 1996 (followed by a three-year contract in 1998). LVMH also offered to buy a stake in his company, but McQueen refused, on the advice of Blow. 'I said, \"They must not buy one share in your company,\"' recalls Blow. As soon as the first funds were wired to his bank, McQueen bought a small terraced house in Islington, north London. LVMH, meanwhile, messengered over caviare and champagne. But McQueen was not impressed - 'I hate champagne' - the moment did have resonance: 'I thought, all this time I've been worrying about being homeless and freaking out about not being able to feed myself, and it was just, like, instantaneous.' McQueen's disaffection with the house best known for dressing Audrey Hepburn was almost as instantaneous - beginning the moment his debut Givenchy Haute Couture collection was disappointingly received in 1997. Though wounded by the reviews, McQueen refused to take the blame. 'I had no support from the French,' he says . 'I'd design, they'd change the whole thing, and then the press would give me the flak for it. It was a case of too many cooks. Every time I'd be doing what I was doing, they'd have a different idea instead of letting me stick to my path, [my] illusion. You have to stick to that illusion, then it becomes identifiable especially for a house that did not have an image apart from Audrey Hepburn. I was never given that chance.' Unlike Galliano - or le petit monsieur , as he has come to be known - who became friends with Arnault's wife and spent frequent weekends at the couple's Saint-Tropez villa, McQueen never made an attempt to immerse himself in French life. He refused to learn the language and crowed over the fact that he had not made a single French friend. By the beginning of the Paris pr t-\u00e0-porter last October, rumours of McQueen's imminent defection from Givenchy were rampant - perhaps because it made sense. After the acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent perfume and pr t-\u00e0-porter, Ford and De Sole made no secret that they were looking for talent to back. As De Sole teasingly told Time in May, 'There are good opportunities. There are companies out there that can be bought. But I do have a limit. I have $2.5bn [\u00a31.7bn].' This, compounded with the persistent rumour that Ford would be giving up Gucci to concentrate on Yves Saint Laurent, only fired up the fashion gossips more. Of course, many of the rumours about McQueen were fuelled by the master provocateur himself, who had been photographed in New York partying at the opening of the Hudson hotel wearing a double-G Gucci fedora. For those who missed that moment, McQueen made his feelings unmistakably clear in an interview published in Arena. 'I asked to leave [Givenchy] in January and they said, \"No, we can't let you leave.\" And I said, \"Well in that case you're just going to let me do my fucking job...\" Otherwise it's going to be the worst year. You know, \"Fire me!\", 'cos that's what I wanted anyway.' And yet, true to unpredictable form, the Givenchy show that McQueen presented in the midst of all the rancour was so universally deemed his strongest to date that few picked up on the fact that the designer's obligatory appearance on the runway at the end of the show was so curt. 'Oh God, yeah,' snorts McQueen. 'I already knew! Why do you think I didn't walk the whole length?' Though Karl Lagerfeld is no stranger to firing off the occasional barb, even he raises an eyebrow over McQueen's public displays of contempt for LVMH: 'I am not sure he did it in a nice way as far as Mr Arnault, who was always very nice and supportive of him in interviews, is concerned.' In Lagerfeld's opinion, however, the chances of the liaison between McQueen and Arnault turning out better than it did weren't good: 'I think the spirit of French couture and his very special view of fashion - nearer to Damien Hirst than to Givenchy - were not made to be matched.' Azzedine Ala\u00efa doesn't agree: 'I respect McQueen for the English eccentricity he instilled in Parisian fashion... He was innocent enough to design clothes that were spectacular and unwearable. I think it's better that he designs his own line, because Givenchy wasn't for him. It didn't suit his character.' Although Arnault and De Sole had been waging a war of supremacy for almost two years, relations between the two titans had been reasonably amicable until early 1999, when Arnault suddenly launched a \u00a35.9bn takeover bid for the Gucci Group. To fend him off, De Sole and Ford brought in a white knight, Fran\u00e7oise Pinault, whose company, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR), bought 42 per cent of the Gucci group for \u00a32bn - thereby thwarting Arnault's plan to count Gucci among the notches in his belt. Even if the script had been written in Hollywood, the McQueen deal could not have been more gripping. On 27 November, Arnault filed a request for the courts to cancel the Gucci-PPR alliance. On 29 November, LVMH filed an official complaint with the US Securities Exchange Commission. The same day, Gucci announced it was going to file a criminal defamation suit against LVMH. On 30 November, LVMH announced it would countersue for defamation. And on 2 December, while the legal papers were flying, McQueen quietly got into bed with Ford and De Sole. The Gucci-McQueen deal is no small blow to Arnault. LVMH has been the unrivalled leader in the luxury goods market - snagging such star talents as Galliano for Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton and Hedi Slimane for Christian Dior menswear. But with the defection of McQueen, Arnault's boast of his pioneering method of putting 'new wine into old bottles' suddenly seems a bit more complicated. Arnault may also have to revise one of his favourite refrains, the one about how comparing Gucci to LVMH is like comparing a start-up company to Microsoft. It is four days after the news was announced, and I am sitting in McQueen's office near Islington. There are 11 months remaining in his contract with LVMH, a detail that is keeping the self-described 'loudmouth' uncharacteristically mum. Even so, his ever-present publicist, Amy Witton, wonders if I'd mind signing a confidentiality agreement. A mixture of fatigue and relief is etched across McQueen's face as he slumps in a chair and pats his body for a Marlboro Light. But then yesterday he was in Paris dealing with the fallout at LVMH. And last night was spent drinking caipirinhas at the Htel Costes with Blow and Marie De Petit Thoars, a descendant of Marie Antoinette's. 'It was a major deal,' he explains flatly. 'I wanted to get it signed quick because of the stress it was causing.' Cleared of all the congratulatory bouquets, his office appears relatively unaffected by the news. Aside from the ringing telephones, the only interruption is the arrival of McQueen's live-in-lover George Forsyth, a 24-year-old documentary film maker who freelances in advertising - here to accompany McQueen to the dentist. Since meeting nine months ago, the two have been inseparable. Last summer, they were married in Ibiza on a yacht owned by the prince of Gambia, an acquaintance of their friend Kate Moss, who played bridesmaid at the ceremony, which was attended by music producer Nellee Hooper and Jude Law and Sadie Frost. Sitting on a table is a box filled with straw and Forsyth's latest acquisition, a tortoise named Billy. Propped against a wall are seven framed photographs by Joel-Peter Witkin - one a birthday present to McQueen from Elton John and David Furnish. Witkin served as the inspiration for the finale of McQueen's spring/summer 2001 show: a model, nude save for a gas mask, brought out in a glass box filled with thousands of fluttering moths, which escaped when the glass was shattered. Although the price Gucci paid McQueen for 51 per cent of his company has not been disclosed, the word on the street is \u00a354m. De Sole insists that number is not accurate, but whatever the amount, Gucci has obviously made a serious commitment to a designer whose collections have featured clothes crawling with live locusts. Ten new stores are allegedly in the offing, and McQueen has been promised his own 'house' in Paris by January 2002, making him the first British designer since Charles Worth to have his own name on a couture collection. 'That was part of the deal,' says McQueen. 'I don't think Arnault would ever have given me that, 'cos he hasn't given John [Galliano] it.' There is also talk of a bespoke business for men. In all of this, McQueen has De Sole's backing. 'We will support the business, we will provide the business expertise, but the one thing that is important is that Alexander must have his creative independence,' says De Sole. 'The question that I had to ask myself - because it's my job - is does he really have the power and the talent to turn the Alexander McQueen label into a global brand? I think he does; otherwise I could not have done the deal, basically.' Tom Ford, co-engineer of the coup d'\u00e9tat, echoes the sentiment: 'For me there is a poetic quality to Lee's work. He is a true artist, albeit an artist with real commercial savvy.' 'Lee', not surprisingly, shares his new owners' confidence in his chances of becoming a contender at cash registers around the world. 'I see [Alexander McQueen] as a luxury-goods label, very modern, very 21st- century,' says McQueen '[But] it doesn't have to be a global brand to the point of Calvin Klein underwear or billboards.' 'I don't like to admit I'm a nice person,' says McQueen. 'But I try to please everyone. I can't, but I try.' McQueen also claims to be quite shy. 'I don't like standing out in a crowd. I clam up. I have panic attacks. What's the word when you can't take praise from anyone? Modest. Yeah. I'm extremely modest.' This from the designer who once had the breathtaking arrogance to declare, 'John [Galliano] was the 80s, and I am the 90s.' 'People think he's aggressive, but of course the aggression comes from the vulnerability,' says Elton John. 'He does strike out, but that's all about insecurity. [John] Lennon was the same.' 'There's beauty in anger,' says McQueen 'Anger for me is a passion. If you don't have passion for something, you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. How can you move something forward, if you are not confrontational? There comes a point where you just have to block off commercialism and do it from the heart. Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren may sell 2,000 pieces of a two-piece suit; I may only sell five of one of my suits. But one of my pieces will count for 1,000.' Again: modest? On the other hand, there are reports that McQueen can be generous and compassionate. One of his friends, the artist Sam Taylor-Wood, recalls the package of clothes McQueen sent after her recovery from breast cancer. And according to Susannah Frankel, his use of a disabled model on the runway wasn't what it seemed. 'Everyone thought, Oh my God, he's going to turn this into a big freak show. But he masked it completely, so when she came out nobody knew. I've met Aimee Mullins [the model]; that's what she's always wanted to do, walk on the runway.' Although McQueen is keen to point out he does not, like so many designers, 'court celebrities', he is fond of Gwyneth Paltrow, who attended his spring 2001 show in London. The two met last summer in New York while McQueen, his trusty publicist Witton, and Katy England, his creative director, were filming an eyewear campaign. 'The way I remember it, I had her assistant's number,' says Witton. 'So [we] thought, \"Oh, wouldn't it be nice if they met up.\" I said, \"Yeah, they're at the Mercer Hotel.\" So Katy said, \"Why doesn't she come to the Mercer?'\" Paltrow did. The three had dinner, discussing among other things the possibility of a collaboration with photographer Nick Knight. 'I like Gwyneth,' says McQueen. 'She's a sweet girl, a typical American blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl... Done well in the movie industry. But I want to pull her apart and put her back together the way I see fit. I like to take people's characters out of themselves.' One other niggling detail guaranteed to rankle those with a mind for logic is that despite McQueen's much-ballyhooed resolve not to sell a stake in his own company to LVMH, in April he proposed the idea to Marianne Tessler, the president of Givenchy. But neither Tessler nor Arnault seemed particularly interested, according to McQueen: 'They said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" And nothing happened.' A month later, Isabella Blow happened to be seated next to Tom Ford at a dinner in London. 'I said, \"Oh, you should look at Alexander,\"' recalls Blow. '\"He might be someone interesting for you to buy.\" And [Ford] said, \"Do you think so? I quite fancy him.\" And I said, \"So do I!\" And he said, \"Well, look, get him to ring me tomorrow.\" So I rang [McQueen] and said, \"Get your arse out of bed and ring Tom Ford - he fancies you.\" He said, \"No he doesn't.\" I said, \"Yes, he does. It could be what you need.\"' 'Izzy told me that [Ford] found me sexy, blah, blah, blah,' says McQueen, 'like you do when you're interested in meeting someone.' (For his part, Ford says, 'Lee looks fierce in photos, but in real life he is a marshmallow - adorable, charming and kind.') Between May and October, a flurry of telephone calls took place between Ford and McQueen, and then early in October the two had dinner at The Ivy. As McQueen tells it, the vibe between them was electric. 'We had Twiggy in front of us and Charles Saatchi behind us, and here we were, these two men sitting at this table, glowing. We were the centre of attention, not because of who we were but because of the strange combination. But we didn't talk about fashion. We talked about our lives, our partners, everything we thought we wouldn't talk about.' The evening was obviously a success. As Richard Buckley, Ford's partner of more than 10 years, remarks, 'Tom would say, \"I'm going out to dinner with Alexander, and you can't come!\" So I knew they were up to something.' Back in May, at a party for Helmut Newton at the Monte Carlo Beach Hotel, McQueen had made himself known to De Sole, who was there with his wife. Despite the two men's somewhat impenetrable accents, they hit it off - with De Sole suggesting they meet up in London. In the middle of October, McQueen decided to warn Tessler that he was in negotiations with Gucci. 'I liked her. That's why I did tell her,' he says. 'I felt like I owed them that. [But] she didn't start fluffing around.' By the time Tessler did start 'fluffing around', it was too late. In the days leading up to the 2 December signing, McQueen managed to avoid most of Tessler's calls. He also had his assistant cancel a dinner scheduled for 1 December in London with Tessler and LVMH president Yves Carcelle. He was certain they were going to offer to back his company if he would agree to stay at Givenchy. But now that Gucci had come through... So he stayed at home, watched TV and had, as he says, 'mad sex'. The following afternoon, McQueen, Forsyth and Witton took a taxi to the Gucci office on Grafton Street. The signing took considerably longer than the designer had anticipated. After the 10th page, he turned to his lawyer and whispered, 'What is this?' It was then that he found out that he wasn't signing a binding agreement, but the actual contract in its entirety. After a celebration of mineral water and a couple of cans of Coke - 'We were working,' says De Sole - McQueen and company walked out in such a daze that on their way to Maison Bertaux, McQueen's favourite Soho patisserie, they got lost. By Monday, the news was official. As the press release was announced, the Gucci Group had signed a definitive agreement to acquire 51 per cent of the luxury designer label Alexander McQueen for an undisclosed price, with the intention of turning the label into a global megabrand. 'This relationship,' it read, 'will become exclusive upon the expiry in October 2001 of his other current creative responsibilities' - pointedly alluding to the remaining months of McQueen's contract with LVMH. The switchboards at the offices of Alexander McQueen in London and Givenchy in Paris were jammed. A terse statement was hurriedly issued by LVMH. Since LVMH had not backed McQueen's own company, the way that it had backed those of John Galliano, Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs, it was 'normal that Mr McQueen should seek financing for his tiny business.' Of all the press McQueen received after the deal, it was the word tiny that most rankled. De Sole, the victor, continued to insist that the timing was completely coincidental. 'The week before the deal, you have to understand, was something pretty disgusting - what they did at LVMH,' he says. 'But it is something we did not control. We were working with Alexander, everything was proceeding, we had already planned to finish that weekend, and then that happened. We just stayed on course. This is nothing to do with our rivalry with LVMH. The fact that Alexander was at Givenchy was totally irrelevant. Some people in fashion were asking me if this was done against LVMH. This was silly. We are business people.' One of the more subversive elements of McQueen's character is that he, too, is something of a businessman. In 1997, for example, he changed the title of his spring '98 show at the last minute - from 'Golden Showers' to 'Untitled' - concerned that American Express, his sponsor, might take offence. The company has sponsored his shows ever since. 'You strive to get that equilibrium and you try to crack that perfect ideal of creativity and commercialism.' says McQueen, in a rare burst of clarity. Still, he insists, it isn't money that fuels him. 'I believe in my integrity,' he says, 'And I believe the sole purpose of fashion is to create and not accumulate.' This does not quite tally with some of his tastes. As friends will attest, 'Lee loves a label.' At the same time, he does not drive a car and still jokes about the one time he flew on a private plane, when Arnault took him back to London on the LVMH jet after the last Givenchy pr t-\u00e0-porter show. 'I felt like Joan Collins,' giggles McQueen, 'like I should have had a fox round my neck.' Joan Collins is one of McQueen's most loyal fans. 'I used to think Saint Laurent was the best cutter,' she declares, 'but [McQueen] cuts better than anyone I can think of. I wore an outfit of his last night to a party - a circular skirt with a huge bird embroidered on it and a jacket edged in fake monkey fur - and everyone was going, \"Whose is that?\" \"God it's fabulous!\"' 'I don't need any more money in my life,' says McQueen, who had a dinner date with Collins at The Ivy that Wednesday. 'I'm in fashion 'cos I love it. I needed to find a way to get that love back.' Which brings us to Didier, the driver whom McQueen inherited from Hubert de Givenchy. 'In all the years I worked there, he never said one word to me,' says McQueen. 'Whether I'd had bad reviews or I'd be crying my eyes out after a terrible row with my boyfriend, he'd just sit there. And he spoke perfect English! I was really hurt by that.' Apparently so, because suddenly McQueen tilts his head back to hide the tears that have welled up in his eyes. 'I was thinking on the way to Charles de Gaulle last night - should I say something to him? In the end, I felt like I should have been driving him! It's, like, that was the mentality I had to deal with. I felt totally isolated. I thought, \"What am I doing working my fucking arse off for this company?\" It still drives me mad thinking about it. But it's fine\u0085 Maybe I'll change the way LVMH thinks. Maybe they'll start to treat people a bit more like human beings.' Who knows whether De Sole will continue to be a beneficent boss? Oe whether Ford, the ferocious perfectionist, will really stand back while the incorrigible McQueen does what he does? Or whether McQueen's image can actually be marketed for the mainstream in the way Gucci's has? And, if so, whether he'll like the result? As his friend Sam Gainsbury says, 'He could jack it all in tomorrow and I wouldn't be surprised.' \u0095 This article was originally published in the March 2001 issue of Talk magazine.",

      "body": "<p>On Friday, I'm going to a party and I must say I'm excited. Haven't a clue what to wear, though. Mostly because the dress code is 12 years ago, and, while willing to enter into the spirit of things, I'm not sure I really want to revisit such sartorial trauma. I remember what was de rigueur in 1989, and, folks, it wasn't pretty. Will it be the washed-out dungarees with the purple Kicker boots? The hooded top with the tracksuit bottoms? Jordans? Shell-tops? British Knights? Should I accessorise with an African skull cap/a crystal on a string/a poncho? </p> <p>One thing I'm sure of: I won't be showing my legs. In 1989, men were boys and girls could well have been. Everything you wore was two sizes too big. You couldn't tell who or what was under there. Even your hair was too long, hanging somewhere between shoulder and knee in just-stepped-out-of-the-chip-pan condition. Flip-flap-flop. When you walked along the street, you looked like a wandering laundry bag. And when you walked into a north-west wind, you had to grab onto bus stops to keep from taking off. </p> <p>The reason for my 'I Heart 1989' clothing crisis is because I'm appearing as an extra in a club scene for the Hacienda film, 24-Hour Party People, that Michael Winterbottom is making in Manchester, with Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson, Sean Harris as Ian Curtis, John Simm as Bernard Sumner. There's been quite a bit of hoo-hah about it, mostly because it's set in the recent past, so many of the protagonists are alive and arguing about what really happened. The film will cover the Manchester scene from Joy Division to Madchester, and it's the Madchester era that I'm revisiting. Which, essentially, means house music and sweating in pastel casualwear. The real Hacienda has long been closed, so we'll be raving-I'm-raving in a film studio. As an official OAP, you'll find me in the Grab-A-Granny arena. </p> <p>I'm interested in going, because I like a party and because I wonder how they'll recreate the atmosphere of that time (other than by providing ecstasy on the door. Wrapped in a smiley bandana.) In 1989 and into 1990, there was an air of revolution, of wild possibility. The government was running scared, bewildered at the idea of its nation's youth spontaneously gathering in huge numbers to... well, to take drugs and to run on the spot and call it dancing. Eventually, it was deemed necessary to pass a law curbing 'repetitive beats'. Nothing new about that: many overexcitable youth fads have resulted in legislation or, at least, arrests. The difference with the one in the early 90s is that it just wouldn't go away.</p> <p>Twelve years later, we're still reaping the legacy. House music is background music, chart music, the sound of the shopping mall and restaurant. Breweries and bars have reinvented themselves, taking over banks, shops and old police stations, refurbishing interiors to recreate the chill-out area in a club. No one goes to pubs any more. Mostly because there are hardly any left (rip up that swirly carpet! paint that wood lilac! swap that dowdy jukebox for two shiny Technics!). But also because, given the choice, most young people would rather go somewhere noisier, dressier, more packed, with better music, on a Friday night. A nightclub, but with brighter lighting. Even the drinks have changed. All those Bacardi Breezers, Vodka Sources - sugar and meths in a bottle - they're fist-sized, which means you can take them on to a dancefloor. Well, have you ever tripped the light fantastic while balancing a pint of Special? And they're strong, alcopops: they get you smashed, quickly. Once you know a good night out can be swallowed in pill form, you get impatient with sipping. </p> <p>But the main thing that's been recognised is the power of young women. Clubs and bars now know that they'd better get the girls in. And now they know how. Girls love dancing, and they love to be included. Happy house music did both. Many pop-music revolutions exclude women, explicitly or implicitly: they're too trainspottery and dismal, requiring a glum attitude, a degree in guitars or shouting, and absolutely no bump in your hustle. But the ones that last - soul, disco, house, r&amp;b, garage - they always include the ladies. Because a club without women is a tragic affair: just young men trying to out-do each other in hard looks and cig-smoking. </p> <p>I hope they include that in 24-Hour Party People. First reports aren't too hopeful, though. Just long lists of men imitating older men: Ralf Little as Peter Hook, Shaun Ryder as his own dad. From Joy Division through to the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays: boys, all boys. Thank God for New Order's Gillian. Even though she doesn't say much.</p> <p>\u0095 Barbara Ellen will be back in two weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Friday, I'm going to a party and I must say I'm excited. Haven't a clue what to wear, though. Mostly because the dress code is 12 years ago, and, while willing to enter into the spirit of things, I'm not sure I really want to revisit such sartorial trauma. I remember what was de rigueur in 1989, and, folks, it wasn't pretty. Will it be the washed-out dungarees with the purple Kicker boots? The hooded top with the tracksuit bottoms? Jordans? Shell-tops? British Knights? Should I accessorise with an African skull cap/a crystal on a string/a poncho? One thing I'm sure of: I won't be showing my legs. In 1989, men were boys and girls could well have been. Everything you wore was two sizes too big. You couldn't tell who or what was under there. Even your hair was too long, hanging somewhere between shoulder and knee in just-stepped-out-of-the-chip-pan condition. Flip-flap-flop. When you walked along the street, you looked like a wandering laundry bag. And when you walked into a north-west wind, you had to grab onto bus stops to keep from taking off. The reason for my 'I Heart 1989' clothing crisis is because I'm appearing as an extra in a club scene for the Hacienda film, 24-Hour Party People, that Michael Winterbottom is making in Manchester, with Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson, Sean Harris as Ian Curtis, John Simm as Bernard Sumner. There's been quite a bit of hoo-hah about it, mostly because it's set in the recent past, so many of the protagonists are alive and arguing about what really happened. The film will cover the Manchester scene from Joy Division to Madchester, and it's the Madchester era that I'm revisiting. Which, essentially, means house music and sweating in pastel casualwear. The real Hacienda has long been closed, so we'll be raving-I'm-raving in a film studio. As an official OAP, you'll find me in the Grab-A-Granny arena. I'm interested in going, because I like a party and because I wonder how they'll recreate the atmosphere of that time (other than by providing ecstasy on the door. Wrapped in a smiley bandana.) In 1989 and into 1990, there was an air of revolution, of wild possibility. The government was running scared, bewildered at the idea of its nation's youth spontaneously gathering in huge numbers to... well, to take drugs and to run on the spot and call it dancing. Eventually, it was deemed necessary to pass a law curbing 'repetitive beats'. Nothing new about that: many overexcitable youth fads have resulted in legislation or, at least, arrests. The difference with the one in the early 90s is that it just wouldn't go away. Twelve years later, we're still reaping the legacy. House music is background music, chart music, the sound of the shopping mall and restaurant. Breweries and bars have reinvented themselves, taking over banks, shops and old police stations, refurbishing interiors to recreate the chill-out area in a club. No one goes to pubs any more. Mostly because there are hardly any left (rip up that swirly carpet! paint that wood lilac! swap that dowdy jukebox for two shiny Technics!). But also because, given the choice, most young people would rather go somewhere noisier, dressier, more packed, with better music, on a Friday night. A nightclub, but with brighter lighting. Even the drinks have changed. All those Bacardi Breezers, Vodka Sources - sugar and meths in a bottle - they're fist-sized, which means you can take them on to a dancefloor. Well, have you ever tripped the light fantastic while balancing a pint of Special? And they're strong, alcopops: they get you smashed, quickly. Once you know a good night out can be swallowed in pill form, you get impatient with sipping. But the main thing that's been recognised is the power of young women. Clubs and bars now know that they'd better get the girls in. And now they know how. Girls love dancing, and they love to be included. Happy house music did both. Many pop-music revolutions exclude women, explicitly or implicitly: they're too trainspottery and dismal, requiring a glum attitude, a degree in guitars or shouting, and absolutely no bump in your hustle. But the ones that last - soul, disco, house, r&amp;b, garage - they always include the ladies. Because a club without women is a tragic affair: just young men trying to out-do each other in hard looks and cig-smoking. I hope they include that in 24-Hour Party People. First reports aren't too hopeful, though. Just long lists of men imitating older men: Ralf Little as Peter Hook, Shaun Ryder as his own dad. From Joy Division through to the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays: boys, all boys. Thank God for New Order's Gillian. Even though she doesn't say much. \u0095 Barbara Ellen will be back in two weeks.",

Crowe, one of the most engaging stars in today's cinema, has been playing variations on this role ever since, most notably in LA Confidential, The Insider, Gladiator and now Taylor Hackford's Proof of Life, a semi-documentary thriller written by Tony Gilroy and inspired by an article in Vanity Fair magazine. </p> <p>Crowe has the open face of James Stewart and Gary Cooper, and he moves with the ambling swagger of Warner Brothers tough guys like Bogart, Robinson, Cagney and Garfield. But in Proof of Life, for the first time outside his native Antipodes (he was born in New Zealand, raised in Australia) he uses his own accent. He's Terry Thorne, an ex-SAS man working in the K and R (kidnapping and ransom) business for a City of London insurance firm. The opening credit sequence, an economical little film in itself, shows him reporting to his suave, immaculately suited bosses on a successful operation that involved freeing a Frenchman from Chechen rebels while holding off double-crossing Russian soldiers. This episode establishes Thorne as a man of probity with the diplomatic gifts of Henry Kissinger and the military skills of a hi-tech Orde Wingate. </p> <p>Meanwhile, down in the fictitious Latin American state of Tecala, the United States government is supporting a right-wing regime that is seeking to promote US oil interests and suppress a ragged band of ex-Marxist guerrillas who deal in cocaine and ransom money. Caught in the crossfire is an idealistic engineer, Peter Bowman (David Morse), who thinks he's building a dam to help the local population though in his heart he knows it's a gift to Tecala's corrupt politicians by an oil conglomerate to obtain rights to build a pipeline. </p> <p>Bowman's marriage to Alice (Meg Ryan) is fraying after years of dispiriting work in the Third World, and at this difficult point he's kidnapped by the terrorists and taken into the mountains. The US embassy refuses help on bogus diplomatic grounds, the local police and army are not to be trusted, and Thorne is dispatched from London to take over the case and bring hope to Alice. </p> <p>It turns out, however, that Bowman's company has just been taken over, that their hostage insurance has lapsed, and the new owners don't want to get involved in freeing him. So Thorne's services are withdrawn and he returns to Europe. In case we miss the point about the utter venality of this political-commercial nexus, Hackford has cast as Bowman's local American boss the most deviously dislikeable character actor since Murray Hamilton (the mayor in Jaws) retired. He's Anthony Heald, best-known as the vindictive shrink who torments Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs and a man who oozes insincerity from every pore. </p> <p>For 40 years, films about Americans in Latin America like State of Siege, Missing, Under Fire and Salvador, have shown up Washington and the local politicians in an equally bad light. Proof of Life is no exception. Fortunately Thorne has a change of heart. He bids farewell to his young son at a smart English boarding school (Gilroy and Hackford must have had some lingering memory of an identical scene in the 1978 film The Wild Geese when mercenary Richard Harris goes off on a similar mission) and returns to help Alice in Tecala. There's an explosive scene in which he, his American mercenary sidekick (David Caruso) and their team turn the tables on Alice's devious Latin assistants and restore her confidence. He then takes over the operation and a fascinating cat-and-mouse game on mobile phones and shortwave radio gets under way between the guerrillas' representative and Thorne - first to establish 'proof of life', then to bargain over the ransom money. </p> <p>As this slow, delicate business proceeds, Bowman is being dragged from camp to camp, physical condition deteriorating, morale fluctuating, hopes encouraged by meeting a captive missionary (Gottfried John). He's also sustained by a photograph of Alice, and we fear that the inevitable intimacy springing up from her dependence on Thorne might turn into something more serious. </p> <p>There are announcements from time to time of which day of captivity we're watching, and wisely Hackford does not rush a film that takes place over four months, relying on his actors and on the continuing suspense to hold our interest. But he does introduce a melodramatic coincidence that more work on the plot could have averted, and at the end he switches into a slap-up action mode of a conventional, though exciting kind, in the manner of pictures like Uncommon Valor about mercenaries freeing PoWs in South-East Asia. </p> <p>These films of liberation come from the captivity stories of the American West as mediated by John Ford's influential The Searchers. In the past I've spoken, not entirely disparagingly, of Hackford being a curious mixture of hack and Ford, and in this expertly crafted film he pays tribute to Ford in having at least three characters paraphrase John Wayne's climactic line in The Searchers: 'Let's go home Debbie'.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> 'I've been around such a long time, you'd think I must be 50 by now,' sighs Amanda de Cadenet. For someone who is 27, she certainly has packed it in. Since becoming Famous For Being Famous at 14, she has been in constant search of a niche to accommodate her peculiar brand of celebrity, a celebrity that has become more commonplace since the advent of docusoaps, reality TV and Heat magazine. Amanda was arguably the first WAIF (Why Am I Famous): young, posh, blonde, buxom and desperate for attention, she danced on nightclub tables in a rubber dress in 1987, much to the consternation of tabloid readers and the staff at her Wiltshire boarding school, who were under the impression she had been tucked up in her dormitory at the time. </p> <p>After that, every step was a matter of public record: the three months in White City children's home after her parents called in the police; the relationship with the boy-band singer (when she was 15); the gig presenting Channel 4's notorious The Word (17); the Playboy shoot and marriage to a pop icon (19); motherhood and the grand exit to Hollywood and what was supposed to be a career in movies (20); a divorce (22) and a romance with Keanu Reeves. Nowadays, Amanda calls herself a photographer and has an exhibition coming up in LA. We should probably give thanks that she never experimented with pop - unlike her boyfriend of the past three years, Nick Kamen, who became very famous indeed after taking his jeans off for a 1986 commercial set in a launderette, and subsequently launched a successful assault on the charts. Amanda has known Nick (now a painter, 'quite abstract', firmly based in London) forever - since she was 14. </p> <p>Do not make the mistake of assuming that Amanda is no longer famous. Why, news of her pregnancy was all over the Sun in January. Just one little problem there, as she points out with a philosophical shrug: she's not pregnant. No, she isn't having Nick's baby, she doesn't know where that came from, she's heard so many weird rumours about herself over the years. But she wouldn't mind having another child 'one day, one day, I don't know. I love him a lot.' </p> <p>I ask if she always had her eye on Nick. </p> <p>'Always, always,' says Amanda, guilelessly. 'There are only two men who I, like, big-time fancied.' </p> <p>'Who's the other one?' </p> <p>Amanda pulls a wry, isn't-it-obvious face: 'Keanu.' When asked how Nick and Keanu get on, she casts me a significant, omigod look, and gives the impression of longing to talk about them all afternoon - only not to a journalist. 'But Nick's the best-looking man I've ever seen, to me. There is never a time when he doesn't look good. Never! Ever-ever-ever. Which is great. Listen, I don't see him for months at a time. So when I'm with him, I stare at him. You know? I watch my boyfriend while he's asleep.' </p> <p>On The Word, Amanda's voice was sloanily mid-Atlantic: the sort of voice that loiters at the junction of the King's Road and Rodeo Drive. Today, the languid consonants of the West Coast dominate, with a vocabulary to match. Her life, she says, is much easier now that she has found her 'format', by which she means eight hours' sleep, no dairy products, no wheat, no caffeine, a little yoga, an hour with a book every day. (Currently, she's reading Cherry by Mary Carr, an autobiographical account of a rebellious Texan adolescence.) Without blushing, she explains she has 'a real love of life', 'a thirst for life', and talks about 'my primary focus' and 'my emotional, psychological place at that time'. Statements conclude with a rhetorical 'you know?' </p> <p>However, there are signs that the charms of Los Angeles are beginning to pall. Because she grew up in London and France, the daughter of a French motor-racing driver and a Manx model-turned-interior designer, she has 'a different kind of sensibility. Part of the life is very alien to me. Americans really love pop culture and I can only handle it for so long.' Amanda, a glorious product of the pop-culture factory line, has a habit of saying things like this without realising how comical they sound: her conversation is a curious mixture of woolliness and heartfelt sincerity. Listening to her, you're struck by how sophisticated she sounds, and at the same time how naive. </p> <p>Were it not for her eight-year-old daughter Atlanta, she'd be back in the UK like a shot, but she and her ex-husband, Duran Duran's John Taylor (the one with the amazing chin), have joint custody, and he has remarried an American, 'so he's firmly stuck in Los Angeles'. But they're talking through the possibilities. 'I would love to come back for good, but it depends. It's just a question of working it out. I can't leave Atlanta in LA, I could never do that. I may end up staying there... I don't know.' </p> <p>She and John originally stormed out of England in the early Nineties, after a photographer snapped her breastfeeding Atlanta on a Hyde Park bench. They ended up in Los Angeles because she was unknown there and 'as far as John was concerned, in America you've got Julia Roberts at the grocery shop, nobody cares - everyone's famous out there'. But things have changed a bit. 'I'm not anonymous in America any more, you know.' It must be a source of irritation that this is less attributable to her film career ('English prisoner' in Brokedown Palace , 'Receptionist' in Grace of My Heart ) than to a splashy social feud with ex-gal pal Courtney Love ('I, uh, don't really have anything to say about that'). Now that the National Enquirer is doorstepping her over the pregnancy story, London seems increasingly appealing, despite the fact that the British paparazzi bring out the bunting whenever she comes to town. Two hours after touching down at Heathrow, she was coming out of a Westbourne Grove health-food store with a girlfriend, clutching a soya barley cup, and there they all were, snapping away. 'Things are only as important as you make them out to be,' says Amanda, mellowly. 'That's really my experience. I've learnt that if you can't get rid of something, you have to find a way to live with it.' </p> <p>At her suggestion, we've met in a smart, noisy little west London deli not far from Nick's home. She does not attract much attention until she tugs off her aviator shades, scarf and overcoat, releasing her tangle of lion-coloured hair (her brunette phase, captured in the recent self-portrait above, was shortlived) and those celebrated undulations. Nowadays, she favours jeans, a candy-pink V-neck and Converse sneakers, which she calls her 'Womble' look - light years away from those tight little black dresses and dagger heels she wore on telly - and despite the fact that she has been suffering from ME for the past year, there is a fetching milkmaid robustness to her appearance. </p> <p>When the waiter comes over, Amanda, who has really lovely manners, gives him a dazzling smile and orders a hearty lunch: organic sausages and dairy-free mash with a decaf soya latte. She has come to London to talk about a possible exhibition of her photographs and to audition for a British film, but she will proceed with care. 'I will not sell anything ever again that I do not believe in. I'm not willing to do a job for pure financial gain. I've done that, and it wasn't worth it. I didn't even know that was what I was doing until a few years later when I realised, \"Oh, the price was me\".' </p> <p>At the moment, she is putting together a collection of her work for the exhibition in LA. The subjects are 'flowers and women who are quite severely physically scarred. I always like imperfection. That's sort of human to me. That's why I photograph women's bodies: I'm not interested in some Sports Illustrated swimsuit model. It's the rolls of fat, saggy tits, whatever. That is beauty to me. That's what I look for. It's the truth. That's real.' </p> <p>Her next project is 'women who marry men who have life sentences, or who are on death row. Don't you think that would be really good?' With a blithe lack of inhibition, Amanda declares: 'I tend to side with people who are considered the underdog. I have empathy.' She tells me about her latest project, photographing people with terminal illnesses for Marie-Claire magazine. The experience taught her that a) it's not worth worrying about tomorrow, and b) it helps if you have a faith. </p> <p>Amanda has been interested in spiritual matters for the past six years. She says she believes in the earth force. 'You know, \"the force is with you\".' Her mother, Anna, who is deeply involved with Aids charities, Crisis and the Hurlingham Club, is Born Again. Amanda suspects her wildchild period, itself triggered by her parents' divorce, nudged her mother towards the Church. 'It sent her off in the right direction, I would say.' </p> <p>Mother and daughter are now close. When Amanda was a child, Anna's passion for routine drove her crazy: now she and Atlanta have their own format, which involves having Chinese takeaway one night a week. Sometimes Monday, sometimes Thursday. Never the same night every week, because that would be too regular. </p> <p>'When I was younger, routine was hell,' says Amanda earnestly. 'It felt like a trap. I hate the idea of people not being able to say what they want to say, be who they are. I don't think it's fair to crush the human spirit. When I was at school, I was told to wear knee socks. Well, now, what's that got to do with anything - with my future, with my career, with my exams, with my brain? But you got punished if you didn't wear knee socks. It's a power trip. Ephemeral shit. That I don't do well with, people asserting authority over others just for the hell of it. Like, injustice,' she continues, sounding very Californian. 'I have a major over-empathy with victims of injustice. Which is why if I watch the news I'm in tears all the time.' Oh dear. </p> <p>There's lots to like about Amanda. She does have a sense of the absurd, though it is fairly well-hidden. After describing, at some length, the spiritual satisfaction she gets from growing beets and celery in her back garden, she adds quite mildly: 'Look, I live in LA, I can get a little metaphysical sometimes.' She is very engaging when talking about Atlanta, a football fanatic who rises at seven when Chelsea have a match so she can watch it live; and about their menagerie: 'cats and dogs and birds and fish and rabbits'. The chihuahua sounds like a bit of a star. 'I really hate dogs like that, but Zig is the cutest dog. People pay 300 bucks for cashmere sweaters for their dogs in LA, you know? Fuck that. We've made his out of socks. We cut the holes for his front legs and stitched his name on it - it's very ragga.' </p> <p>Is Amanda's past always going to drown out her present, her future? She is doing her best not to let it. 'I'm not interested in sitting here and talking about choices I made when I was, like, 14 years old. I've done all that. Of course all those things make me the person I am today, but it is not where I live.' </p> <p>Mostly, she tolerates my questions and addresses them with killer solemnity, but at one point she puts down her latte and says: 'I suddenly realised... I don't really do interviews so much any more. I find it quite exposing in a way. I have a friend who will not talk about anything to do with his personal life, nothing. If anyone talks about anything other than his work, he'll just sit there. He's a very hard interview.' </p> <p>I say that he must be a bit of a superstar to get away with that. </p> <p>'Yes, he is,' says Amanda, proudly. </p> <p>Who? </p> <p>'Oh, Keanu. He will just look at people. He will not answer the question.' It's a nice moment: Amanda, smitten with Keanu's mystique, effectively blowing her own.</p>",

Amanda was arguably the first WAIF (Why Am I Famous): young, posh, blonde, buxom and desperate for attention, she danced on nightclub tables in a rubber dress in 1987, much to the consternation of tabloid readers and the staff at her Wiltshire boarding school, who were under the impression she had been tucked up in her dormitory at the time. After that, every step was a matter of public record: the three months in White City children's home after her parents called in the police; the relationship with the boy-band singer (when she was 15); the gig presenting Channel 4's notorious The Word (17); the Playboy shoot and marriage to a pop icon (19); motherhood and the grand exit to Hollywood and what was supposed to be a career in movies (20); a divorce (22) and a romance with Keanu Reeves. Nowadays, Amanda calls herself a photographer and has an exhibition coming up in LA. We should probably give thanks that she never experimented with pop - unlike her boyfriend of the past three years, Nick Kamen, who became very famous indeed after taking his jeans off for a 1986 commercial set in a launderette, and subsequently launched a successful assault on the charts. Amanda has known Nick (now a painter, 'quite abstract', firmly based in London) forever - since she was 14. Do not make the mistake of assuming that Amanda is no longer famous. Why, news of her pregnancy was all over the Sun in January. Just one little problem there, as she points out with a philosophical shrug: she's not pregnant. No, she isn't having Nick's baby, she doesn't know where that came from, she's heard so many weird rumours about herself over the years. But she wouldn't mind having another child 'one day, one day, I don't know. I love him a lot.' I ask if she always had her eye on Nick. 'Always, always,' says Amanda, guilelessly. 'There are only two men who I, like, big-time fancied.' 'Who's the other one?' Amanda pulls a wry, isn't-it-obvious face: 'Keanu.' When asked how Nick and Keanu get on, she casts me a significant, omigod look, and gives the impression of longing to talk about them all afternoon - only not to a journalist. 'But Nick's the best-looking man I've ever seen, to me. There is never a time when he doesn't look good. Never! Ever-ever-ever. Which is great. Listen, I don't see him for months at a time. So when I'm with him, I stare at him. You know? I watch my boyfriend while he's asleep.' On The Word, Amanda's voice was sloanily mid-Atlantic: the sort of voice that loiters at the junction of the King's Road and Rodeo Drive. Today, the languid consonants of the West Coast dominate, with a vocabulary to match. Her life, she says, is much easier now that she has found her 'format', by which she means eight hours' sleep, no dairy products, no wheat, no caffeine, a little yoga, an hour with a book every day. (Currently, she's reading Cherry by Mary Carr, an autobiographical account of a rebellious Texan adolescence.) Without blushing, she explains she has 'a real love of life', 'a thirst for life', and talks about 'my primary focus' and 'my emotional, psychological place at that time'. Statements conclude with a rhetorical 'you know?' However, there are signs that the charms of Los Angeles are beginning to pall. Because she grew up in London and France, the daughter of a French motor-racing driver and a Manx model-turned-interior designer, she has 'a different kind of sensibility. Part of the life is very alien to me. Americans really love pop culture and I can only handle it for so long.' Amanda, a glorious product of the pop-culture factory line, has a habit of saying things like this without realising how comical they sound: her conversation is a curious mixture of woolliness and heartfelt sincerity. Listening to her, you're struck by how sophisticated she sounds, and at the same time how naive. Were it not for her eight-year-old daughter Atlanta, she'd be back in the UK like a shot, but she and her ex-husband, Duran Duran's John Taylor (the one with the amazing chin), have joint custody, and he has remarried an American, 'so he's firmly stuck in Los Angeles'. But they're talking through the possibilities. 'I would love to come back for good, but it depends. It's just a question of working it out. I can't leave Atlanta in LA, I could never do that. I may end up staying there... I don't know.' She and John originally stormed out of England in the early Nineties, after a photographer snapped her breastfeeding Atlanta on a Hyde Park bench. They ended up in Los Angeles because she was unknown there and 'as far as John was concerned, in America you've got Julia Roberts at the grocery shop, nobody cares - everyone's famous out there'. But things have changed a bit. 'I'm not anonymous in America any more, you know.' It must be a source of irritation that this is less attributable to her film career ('English prisoner' in Brokedown Palace , 'Receptionist' in Grace of My Heart ) than to a splashy social feud with ex-gal pal Courtney Love ('I, uh, don't really have anything to say about that'). Now that the National Enquirer is doorstepping her over the pregnancy story, London seems increasingly appealing, despite the fact that the British paparazzi bring out the bunting whenever she comes to town. Two hours after touching down at Heathrow, she was coming out of a Westbourne Grove health-food store with a girlfriend, clutching a soya barley cup, and there they all were, snapping away. 'Things are only as important as you make them out to be,' says Amanda, mellowly. 'That's really my experience. I've learnt that if you can't get rid of something, you have to find a way to live with it.' At her suggestion, we've met in a smart, noisy little west London deli not far from Nick's home. She does not attract much attention until she tugs off her aviator shades, scarf and overcoat, releasing her tangle of lion-coloured hair (her brunette phase, captured in the recent self-portrait above, was shortlived) and those celebrated undulations. Nowadays, she favours jeans, a candy-pink V-neck and Converse sneakers, which she calls her 'Womble' look - light years away from those tight little black dresses and dagger heels she wore on telly - and despite the fact that she has been suffering from ME for the past year, there is a fetching milkmaid robustness to her appearance. When the waiter comes over, Amanda, who has really lovely manners, gives him a dazzling smile and orders a hearty lunch: organic sausages and dairy-free mash with a decaf soya latte. She has come to London to talk about a possible exhibition of her photographs and to audition for a British film, but she will proceed with care. 'I will not sell anything ever again that I do not believe in. I'm not willing to do a job for pure financial gain. I've done that, and it wasn't worth it. I didn't even know that was what I was doing until a few years later when I realised, \"Oh, the price was me\".' At the moment, she is putting together a collection of her work for the exhibition in LA. The subjects are 'flowers and women who are quite severely physically scarred. I always like imperfection. That's sort of human to me. That's why I photograph women's bodies: I'm not interested in some Sports Illustrated swimsuit model. It's the rolls of fat, saggy tits, whatever. That is beauty to me. That's what I look for. It's the truth. That's real.' Her next project is 'women who marry men who have life sentences, or who are on death row. Don't you think that would be really good?' With a blithe lack of inhibition, Amanda declares: 'I tend to side with people who are considered the underdog. I have empathy.' She tells me about her latest project, photographing people with terminal illnesses for Marie-Claire magazine. The experience taught her that a) it's not worth worrying about tomorrow, and b) it helps if you have a faith. Amanda has been interested in spiritual matters for the past six years. She says she believes in the earth force. 'You know, \"the force is with you\".' Her mother, Anna, who is deeply involved with Aids charities, Crisis and the Hurlingham Club, is Born Again. Amanda suspects her wildchild period, itself triggered by her parents' divorce, nudged her mother towards the Church. 'It sent her off in the right direction, I would say.' Mother and daughter are now close. When Amanda was a child, Anna's passion for routine drove her crazy: now she and Atlanta have their own format, which involves having Chinese takeaway one night a week. Sometimes Monday, sometimes Thursday. Never the same night every week, because that would be too regular. 'When I was younger, routine was hell,' says Amanda earnestly. 'It felt like a trap. I hate the idea of people not being able to say what they want to say, be who they are. I don't think it's fair to crush the human spirit. When I was at school, I was told to wear knee socks. Well, now, what's that got to do with anything - with my future, with my career, with my exams, with my brain? But you got punished if you didn't wear knee socks. It's a power trip. Ephemeral shit. That I don't do well with, people asserting authority over others just for the hell of it. Like, injustice,' she continues, sounding very Californian. 'I have a major over-empathy with victims of injustice. Which is why if I watch the news I'm in tears all the time.' Oh dear. There's lots to like about Amanda. She does have a sense of the absurd, though it is fairly well-hidden. After describing, at some length, the spiritual satisfaction she gets from growing beets and celery in her back garden, she adds quite mildly: 'Look, I live in LA, I can get a little metaphysical sometimes.' She is very engaging when talking about Atlanta, a football fanatic who rises at seven when Chelsea have a match so she can watch it live; and about their menagerie: 'cats and dogs and birds and fish and rabbits'. The chihuahua sounds like a bit of a star. 'I really hate dogs like that, but Zig is the cutest dog. People pay 300 bucks for cashmere sweaters for their dogs in LA, you know? Fuck that. We've made his out of socks. We cut the holes for his front legs and stitched his name on it - it's very ragga.' Is Amanda's past always going to drown out her present, her future? She is doing her best not to let it. 'I'm not interested in sitting here and talking about choices I made when I was, like, 14 years old. I've done all that. Of course all those things make me the person I am today, but it is not where I live.' Mostly, she tolerates my questions and addresses them with killer solemnity, but at one point she puts down her latte and says: 'I suddenly realised... I don't really do interviews so much any more. I find it quite exposing in a way. I have a friend who will not talk about anything to do with his personal life, nothing. If anyone talks about anything other than his work, he'll just sit there. He's a very hard interview.' I say that he must be a bit of a superstar to get away with that. 'Yes, he is,' says Amanda, proudly. Who? 'Oh, Keanu. He will just look at people. He will not answer the question.' It's a nice moment: Amanda, smitten with Keanu's mystique, effectively blowing her own.",

They pay 7 per cent gross monthly, which acts as a top-up to our pensions, but the new bonds pay only 4.9 per cent. Can you recommend another investment which approaches our original one and is equally safe?<br><strong> LR, Tonbridge </strong> </p> <p>No savings are quite as safe as National Savings, but bank and building society deposit accounts come close. Interest rates are falling and National Savings is particularly uncompetitive. </p> <p>You get the best rates on cash Isas: between 6.75 and 7 per cent is good. Outside Isas, the best instant access accounts pay 6 to 6.5 per cent on \u00a35,000; try Birmingham Midshires (0845 602 2828) and Saga (0800 056 5094). Scarborough building society (0845 458 4458) pays 6 per cent on \u00a3100. Notice accounts pay no better, apart from Safeway at 6.9 per cent on a minimum \u00a310,000 at 60 days' notice. With internet access, Abbey National's eSaver pays 6.85 per cent, Nationwide 6.7 per cent and Smile's cash Isa 7.25 per cent. </p> <p>Unlike Pensioners Bonds, these rates are not fixed. Neither do they pay monthly interest. You can make withdrawals each month from instant access accounts; some Isas organise monthly withdrawals. Birmingham Midshires has a new guaranteed income bond for over-fifties, paying monthly at 5.75 per cent guaranteed for five years.</p> <p><strong>Cancelled holidays</strong></p> <p>A year ago, Lisa Rimell of Bristol contacted Money Writes because Atlas Travel Insurance had rejected her travel claim. Her parents had booked a family holiday in Portugal for the previous June. Her mother arranged insurance for the other five members of the family through the travel agent but the parents were refused cover when they declared they were suffering from cancer. Their doctors confirmed that they were fit to travel at the time of booking. </p> <p>Both parents' conditions worsened towards the end of April and Lisa's mother told the travel agents to cancel the holiday. They died at the end of June, within three days of each other.</p> <p>The underwriter refused to refund the cost of cancelling the holiday, claiming the cause was a pre-existing medical condition which had not been disclosed. Lisa argued that the travel agent, acting as insurance agent, talked to her mother about the cancer and completed the application forms for the rest of the family.</p> <p>The insurer also refused to pay on the grounds that the holiday was not cancelled in writing. Although she did not have a copy of the handwritten letter, Lisa was confident that her mother did write, and received written confirmation.</p> <p>At the same time as writing to the Observer , Lisa took a case through the small claims track (what used to be called the small claims court).</p> <p>In January, Lisa and her brother won their case. The judge agreed that the parents were obviously acting for the whole family in booking the holiday, and insurance. He thought it would be odd if, when Lisa's mother declared the illness, she did not do it on behalf of the whole party. He noted that when the underwriters learned of the parents' cancer, they did not notify the others that their cover would be restricted.</p> <p>Lisa says: 'We were awarded \u00a32,440 between us plus \u00a350 expenses each and the court fee of \u00a3100. The court fee is the only financial cost involved in making a claim via the small claims track, but my brother and I had to spend a considerable amount of time responding to correspondence from both the court and the defendant's solicitors.' </p> <p>\u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

They pay 7 per cent gross monthly, which acts as a top-up to our pensions, but the new bonds pay only 4.9 per cent. Can you recommend another investment which approaches our original one and is equally safe? LR, Tonbridge No savings are quite as safe as National Savings, but bank and building society deposit accounts come close. Interest rates are falling and National Savings is particularly uncompetitive. You get the best rates on cash Isas: between 6.75 and 7 per cent is good. Outside Isas, the best instant access accounts pay 6 to 6.5 per cent on \u00a35,000; try Birmingham Midshires (0845 602 2828) and Saga (0800 056 5094). Scarborough building society (0845 458 4458) pays 6 per cent on \u00a3100. Notice accounts pay no better, apart from Safeway at 6.9 per cent on a minimum \u00a310,000 at 60 days' notice. With internet access, Abbey National's eSaver pays 6.85 per cent, Nationwide 6.7 per cent and Smile's cash Isa 7.25 per cent. Unlike Pensioners Bonds, these rates are not fixed. Neither do they pay monthly interest. You can make withdrawals each month from instant access accounts; some Isas organise monthly withdrawals. Birmingham Midshires has a new guaranteed income bond for over-fifties, paying monthly at 5.75 per cent guaranteed for five years. Cancelled holidays A year ago, Lisa Rimell of Bristol contacted Money Writes because Atlas Travel Insurance had rejected her travel claim. Her parents had booked a family holiday in Portugal for the previous June. Her mother arranged insurance for the other five members of the family through the travel agent but the parents were refused cover when they declared they were suffering from cancer. Their doctors confirmed that they were fit to travel at the time of booking. Both parents' conditions worsened towards the end of April and Lisa's mother told the travel agents to cancel the holiday. They died at the end of June, within three days of each other. The underwriter refused to refund the cost of cancelling the holiday, claiming the cause was a pre-existing medical condition which had not been disclosed. Lisa argued that the travel agent, acting as insurance agent, talked to her mother about the cancer and completed the application forms for the rest of the family. The insurer also refused to pay on the grounds that the holiday was not cancelled in writing. Although she did not have a copy of the handwritten letter, Lisa was confident that her mother did write, and received written confirmation. At the same time as writing to the Observer , Lisa took a case through the small claims track (what used to be called the small claims court). In January, Lisa and her brother won their case. The judge agreed that the parents were obviously acting for the whole family in booking the holiday, and insurance. He thought it would be odd if, when Lisa's mother declared the illness, she did not do it on behalf of the whole party. He noted that when the underwriters learned of the parents' cancer, they did not notify the others that their cover would be restricted. Lisa says: 'We were awarded \u00a32,440 between us plus \u00a350 expenses each and the court fee of \u00a3100. The court fee is the only financial cost involved in making a claim via the small claims track, but my brother and I had to spend a considerable amount of time responding to correspondence from both the court and the defendant's solicitors.' \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

The big change was buying a house. While Claire takes care of the mortgage, he borrowed money from his father for the deposit, which he is now repaying. 'I have never been one to scrimp now to have money later.' </p> <p> Money messes up some of the characters in Snap - the lowlife prostitute, for instance, who finds the money too good and will not come off the game despite 'the bruises over her body, the discharge, the awful pains in her abdomen'. </p> <p> But even in his social life now, Powell sees people who are guided by money, not happiness.

      "body": "<p>If your Tessa is coming up to maturity and you do not want to cash it in, start looking for a new home for your money. Otherwise it will sit in a holding account which is likely to pay a meagre rate of interest. If you don't act within six months, you could lose a valuable tax break. </p> <p>The two main options available to you are a cash mini Isa or a Tessa-only Isa. Taking out a new Tessa is not an option any more: Tessas were closed to new investors in 1999 and replaced by Isas. </p> <p>Tessa-only Isas, or Toisas, enable you to reinvest the capital - although not the interest earned - from your maturing Tessa in another tax shelter without losing any of your Isa entitlements. They come in three guises: variable-rate, fixed-rate or stock market-linked. Variable-rate Toisas, whose rates move roughly in line with general movements in interest rates, are by far the most common. </p> <p>Toisas benefit from higher rates than on standard savings accounts. They pay up to 7 per cent on a variable-rate account and about 6 per cent on a fixed-rate deal. By contrast, the average instant-access account pays just 1.62 per cent before tax. </p> <p>Toisas are also more flexible than the old Tessas. Tessas allowed you to save up to \u00a39,000 over five years and earn tax-free interest as long as the capital was untouched. Because the Toisa operates under Isa rules rather than those governing the old Tessas, you don't have to leave the capital untouched for five years to keep the tax break - you can withdraw chunks whenever you need to. However, taking out money will also mean the loss of your tax-free allowance for that year. Watch out as well for restrictions imposed by individual institutions on access to your money. Terms vary widely, with notice periods of anywhere between 30 days and three years. </p> <p>Money in Toisas does not count towards your normal Isa investment allowance for the year, so you can put up to \u00a39,000 into a Toisa without it reducing your \u00a37,000 Isa allowance. This is where it has the upper hand over the cash mini Isa option for Tessa holders. </p> <p>But don't assume that your current Tessa provider will offer the best Toisa deal. Ideally, you should put your money in a bank or building society with a good track record. Best buys according to adviser David Aaron Partnership include Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's and Bradford &amp; Bingley's variable-rate Toisas, which pay 6.75 and 6.25 per cent respectively. To transfer to a new provider, simply ask your old provider for a maturity certificate, which proves the money is tax exempt, and take it to your new one, which will arrange the changeover. </p> <p>If you are willing to take more of a gamble you may prefer an equity-linked Toisa, where returns relate to the stock market. The potential for higher returns is greater, but so is the risk that your money will not grow. As Andrew Jones of David Aaron puts it: 'The risk is zero return.' Whatever happens, your capital is guaranteed and will not be eroded. </p> <p>Rival financial adviser Chase de Vere favours equity Toisas above the others. Chase's Janine Starks says: 'Variable rates are fine if you want a completely safe investment but returns on them are not the same as they used to be thanks to the low interest rate environment. Links to the stock market provide potentially better rates of return. The top five performers in the past five years have been equity-linked Toisas returning an average of \u00a316,000 on a \u00a39,000 investment, compared with \u00a312,500 for variable deals.' </p> <p>HSBC has recently launched its Performance plus Tessa Isa, whose return is linked to the FTSE 100 index. If the index rises, your investment will increase by a proportionate amount. If it falls, you get back only your original investment. Bristol &amp; West and Birmingham Midshires also offer equity-linked Toisas. </p> <p>Fixed-rate deals make sense if interest rates fall over the period to which the fix applies. However, the rates are so low at present that the fixes do not represent good value, Chase says. Providers include Norwich &amp; Peterborough, currently offering 6.25 per cent a year for five years, and Leeds &amp; Holbeck. </p> <p>Toisa rates are generally buoyant at the moment to attract maturing Tessa funds, but there is a danger they will come down if the base rate falls. Also beware of banks and building societies that hoist their rates in the first few weeks to attract new money, only to cut them once they have your savings safely in the bag. </p> <p>People with maturing Tessas have six months to decide what to do with their money before it loses its tax-exempt status. It is better to decide as soon as possible, as once the Tessa has matured, many banks and building societies will transfer the funds into an instant access savings account unless instructed otherwise. Not only do these accounts usually pay derisory rates of interest, but it is taxed, too. So leaving money to languish can lose you money. </p> <p>A full list of available Toisas can be obtained from Moneyfacts magazine on 01603 476 100. </p> <p>Chase de Vere publishes a free guide to Tessas - available from 0845 609 2005.</p>",

They pay up to 7 per cent on a variable-rate account and about 6 per cent on a fixed-rate deal. By contrast, the average instant-access account pays just 1.62 per cent before tax. Toisas are also more flexible than the old Tessas. Tessas allowed you to save up to \u00a39,000 over five years and earn tax-free interest as long as the capital was untouched. Because the Toisa operates under Isa rules rather than those governing the old Tessas, you don't have to leave the capital untouched for five years to keep the tax break - you can withdraw chunks whenever you need to. However, taking out money will also mean the loss of your tax-free allowance for that year. Watch out as well for restrictions imposed by individual institutions on access to your money. Terms vary widely, with notice periods of anywhere between 30 days and three years. Money in Toisas does not count towards your normal Isa investment allowance for the year, so you can put up to \u00a39,000 into a Toisa without it reducing your \u00a37,000 Isa allowance. This is where it has the upper hand over the cash mini Isa option for Tessa holders. But don't assume that your current Tessa provider will offer the best Toisa deal. Ideally, you should put your money in a bank or building society with a good track record. Best buys according to adviser David Aaron Partnership include Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's and Bradford &amp; Bingley's variable-rate Toisas, which pay 6.75 and 6.25 per cent respectively. To transfer to a new provider, simply ask your old provider for a maturity certificate, which proves the money is tax exempt, and take it to your new one, which will arrange the changeover. If you are willing to take more of a gamble you may prefer an equity-linked Toisa, where returns relate to the stock market. The potential for higher returns is greater, but so is the risk that your money will not grow. As Andrew Jones of David Aaron puts it: 'The risk is zero return.' Whatever happens, your capital is guaranteed and will not be eroded. Rival financial adviser Chase de Vere favours equity Toisas above the others. Chase's Janine Starks says: 'Variable rates are fine if you want a completely safe investment but returns on them are not the same as they used to be thanks to the low interest rate environment. Links to the stock market provide potentially better rates of return. The top five performers in the past five years have been equity-linked Toisas returning an average of \u00a316,000 on a \u00a39,000 investment, compared with \u00a312,500 for variable deals.' HSBC has recently launched its Performance plus Tessa Isa, whose return is linked to the FTSE 100 index. If the index rises, your investment will increase by a proportionate amount. If it falls, you get back only your original investment. Bristol &amp; West and Birmingham Midshires also offer equity-linked Toisas. Fixed-rate deals make sense if interest rates fall over the period to which the fix applies. However, the rates are so low at present that the fixes do not represent good value, Chase says. Providers include Norwich &amp; Peterborough, currently offering 6.25 per cent a year for five years, and Leeds &amp; Holbeck. Toisa rates are generally buoyant at the moment to attract maturing Tessa funds, but there is a danger they will come down if the base rate falls. Also beware of banks and building societies that hoist their rates in the first few weeks to attract new money, only to cut them once they have your savings safely in the bag. People with maturing Tessas have six months to decide what to do with their money before it loses its tax-exempt status. It is better to decide as soon as possible, as once the Tessa has matured, many banks and building societies will transfer the funds into an instant access savings account unless instructed otherwise. Not only do these accounts usually pay derisory rates of interest, but it is taxed, too. So leaving money to languish can lose you money. A full list of available Toisas can be obtained from Moneyfacts magazine on 01603 476 100. Chase de Vere publishes a free guide to Tessas - available from 0845 609 2005.",

      "body": "<p>It's everyone's mid-winter nightmare - radiators as icy as the temperature outside. It was 3pm on a freezing January afternoon when I first realised that the the boiler in my flat had broken down. I rang British Gas: our landlord has a contract with them under which they guarantee to send someone round within 24 hours. I told the operator that I could smell gas. 'I am forced to notify Transco,' he said. A Transco engineer would be around within two hours, I was told, and a British Gas repairman would be round some time between midday and 6pm the next day. </p> <p>By 6pm the Transco engineer arrived. He detected no leak. I asked him what was wrong with the boiler. He said that before privatisation he could have checked for a leak and fixed the boiler all in one trip. But the new company would not grant him safety clearance to the higher level of boiler repair. He very kindly explained that, despite his 20 years' experience fixing boilers before privatisation, he was not allowed to help. </p> <p>My flatmate and I spent a cold and unhygienic day huddled around an oil heater. I had the next week off, and so my 'holiday' would begin with a day at home waiting for the gasman. The next day, at around 4pm, the British Gas engineer, Keith, arrived. He took the cover off the boiler and said that too much water pressure had built up inside. He then let some of the water off into a bucket. The water was brown. 'Too much sludge and silt in the pipes,' he said. We would need the pipes cleaning and a new boiler - most probably. For the meantime, the boiler would work, he said. Sure enough, he put the cover back on and lit it up. We had hot water. </p> <p>Two hours later, I went for a long-delayed shower - the neighbours had started to complain. The water was cold again. The boiler had turned itself off. I rang British Gas again. The first few times they said it was too busy and I should call later. I eventually found a spare line and held for about 15 minutes. </p> <p>The operator told me that, under the service contract we had, the company could not be called out again to fix the boiler without charging. Apparently, our pipes needed cleaning, and any other attempts at fixing it would be mere timewasting. He said that Keith should have quoted me a price for cleaning the pipes and installing a new boiler. He offered to get Keith to have the quote sent to my landlord, who could then authorise the work. 'I really, really apologise,' he said. Next day I rang British Gas again. I had by now become accustomed to the sound of Puccini's 'Nessun Dorma' and Lloyd Webber's 'The Music of The Night' as I waited for answers to my calls. </p> <p>After a 10-minute wait, I reached another operator, who said that last night's operator had misinformed me. Keith couldn't do it that way, and I'd need another engineer. But, if I wanted a new boiler and clean pipes, I'd best speak to sales. She'd try and put me through. </p> <p>Pavarotti was pretty much exhausted when the operator said sales weren't answering the phone, so she'd have to get them to call me. They didn't. I called British Gas back. </p> <p>This time I got somebody whom I can call obnoxious at best. She said that it wasn't her fault that I hadn't been called. I agreed and asked her not to be so antagonistic. She said I was being antagonistic, and then asked me to hold. Her team leader interrupted to tell me that I had to speak to sales. She tried to put me through. Sales were engaged, but they would call me, she said. </p> <p>I rang British Gas back a few hours later. I then got an enormously helpful woman who said that sales didn't need to be involved. An engineer could do the quote. Did I want to stay in and wait for him the whole day or just the afternoon? I had been waiting all day when the gasmen arrived at nearly three o'clock. At this point, I must add that my landlord had been taking alternative action. He had asked a local boilerman to call. He took off the cover of the boiler, and then found an override switch on the back. One press of this button got the boiler working again. It has worked well ever since. He said the pipes might need a clean, but a new boiler was, in his opinion, probably unnecessary. </p> <p>The boiler was working very well when British Gas arrived. Two men in their late twenties approached the boiler, pressed a few buttons, and then wrote out a quote that said clean pipes would cost \u00a3550. But one of them added that this procedure might not work. Only a new boiler could guarantee perfect performance. How much would that be, I asked? '\u00a32100,' he said. I'd have to wait at least two weeks for the work to be done, he added. </p> <p>British Gas failed to keep the last appointment to fix the boiler and it has yet to explain why. The boiler still works. But its brief collapse granted me a glimpse of British Gas's monumental incompetence in dealing with such a simple issue. We were messed about for four days, and, had a local boilerman not intervened, we would still be without heating. </p> <p>I rang British Gas about this article. 'It is very unfortunate and we can only apologise,' said a contrite spokeswoman. 'That is not the service we expect customers to receive.' She added that my boiler was installed in 1972 and that I had been aware that it was ailing for a few months. </p> <p>I asked if, had I been a pensioner or the parent of young children, I might have expected a shorter waiting time than two weeks. 'No,' was the answer. She also said that British Gas offered a quality service and if I found this state of affairs unacceptable I was welcome 'to go to another engineer'. So I have.</p> <p><strong>Can't stand the heat? </strong></p> <p>I'm not alone in my experience, writes Nick Paton Walsh. Energywatch, the energy consumer's complaints body, recorded 19,486 complaints against British Gas last year. 17,581 of these involved the customer having to complain twice to Energywatch. Npower Calortex was the only firm to come close, with 4531 complaints. British Gas attracts 45 per cent of all complaints against domestic gas suppliers. Complaints have been going down, but these figures mean that only ten per cent of complaints are settled first time around.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cold callers Call centres and automated telephone systems get the thumbs down from the public, according to a survey by market researchers Valoris. Call centre staff were found to be unhelpful while the telephone systems were deemed irritating. The survey into technology and its use as a means of communication also found that less than a fifth of those questioned had bought products on the web. Interactive TV also left them cold.

Britons now spend more on having a good time than on keeping a roof over their heads, a government report reveals. </p> <p>The average household is spending a record-breaking \u00a362.50 a week on leisure, according to Family Spending , published by the Office for National Statistics. This compares with \u00a357 a week on housing, \u00a362.50 a week on food and \u00a353 a week on that other essential, motoring. </p> <p>A generation ago the sums looked rather different.

'Twenty or 30 years ago our money went towards staying alive. Now it goes on having fun.' </p> <p>Arguably this is due to an across-the-board increase in wages. In 2000 the gross household income was \u00a3475 per week. In 1970, it equated to less than \u00a3300. 'There's been a rapid increase in wealth and personal disposable income,' says Hayward. 'And a lot of us are still getting used to it.' </p> <p>But not everyone has yet to get to grips with this problem. Family Spending divided the households who responded to its survey in to 10 income groups. The richest has \u00a3780 a week to dispose of. The poorest has \u00a3120. These two extremes used their leisure pounds in markedly different ways. </p> <p>The highest group spent 10 times more on going to the theatre and the cinema than the lowest. The highest group spent 25 per cent of their food expenditure on dining out; the lowest group spent eight per cent. The highest group spent 42 per cent of their sports and entertainment expenditure on going to a game, the lowest spent 10 per cent. The latter were far more likely to spend what money they did have on a satellite dish so as to watch the match at home. As for that holiday abroad, the top 10 per cent of households could afford \u00a334.50 a week, the bottom 10 per cent considerably less - \u00a31.90. </p> <p>Yet the big picture is not as bad as all that, says Melanie Swift, editor of trade publication Leisure and Hospital ity Business. 'Leisure has become an important part of our lifestyle. It is not so much a luxury as a necessary release given our working patterns and our pace of life. And this is true of everyone. Even in low-income families, people are spending money in ways that make them happy and keep them sane.' </p> <p>But are we all spending too much on enjoying ourselves today, and not enough on saving for tomorrow? Findings suggests that no, we are not. In fact, Britons are spending more on finance and financial services than ever before. It is the fastest growing consumer sector, according to market researcher Mintel. It has risen 5.7 percentage points in 10 years. To put that in context, the next fastest growing consumer sector is travel, which has risen 0.5 percentage points over the same period. </p> <p>So we are not scrimping on our life assurance in order to have an extra long weekend away - we are having both. This is a 'good sign', says Mintel analyst Shaheed Alam. 'We seem to be taking quite a balanced approach. We are making the most of the present.

People will not only want to purchase a good product, they will want to purchase a good experience. </p> <p>'It will come to a point when people will find that they get less and less satisfaction out of simply acquiring yet another material possession.

      "body": "<p>Are you in denial about your pension, tax return and credit cards? Do 'don't go there' signs pop into your mind every time you consider sorting out your finances? Then you may benefit from a life coach. </p> <p>Life coaches help you assess your life now and work out how to change it to the way you want to be in future - fitter, happier and possibly richer. Getting a life coach may seem as indulgent as having a personal trainer to drag you out of bed to go jogging every morning, yet life coaching, which originated in the US, is gaining popularity in the UK. </p> <p>There are about 450 life coaches in this country, which means there are probably up to 20,000 people involved in life coaching, according to Aboodi Shaby, president of the International Coach Federation in the UK. </p> <p>He coaches 14 clients, spending hours on the phone with them each week. He also keeps up with clients via emails in between calls, as well as maintaining a website and writing a book. 'I'm not a guru, I'm not a magician, but I am keeping people on track,' he says. </p> <p>The coaching is rarely conducted face to face - so the next time you see a colleague sitting on a park bench at lunchtime, talking seriously into a mobile phone and nodding sagely, you could be witnessing a coaching session. Sometimes with as little as one half-hour telephone call each week, life coaches check in with their clients to support, encourage and galvanise people to continue with the commitments they have already made. </p> <p>But if you need to change your attitudes towards money - curbing compulsive spending and keeping to a budget while you pay off your debts - possibly the last thing you want to do is shell out up to \u00a3200 each month just to chat to someone whom you may have never met about how you can't stop money trickling through your fingers. </p> <p>And surely the best person to advise you on your finances is an independent financial adviser? </p> <p>But while a financial adviser may wheel out the latest on the best Tessa-only Isa, he's unlikely to truffle out what really trips you up when grappling with your finances. </p> <p>'People have one or two issues about money,' explains coach Niki Cassidy. These issues could be related to how our parents perceived money: was it hard or easy to come by in your family home? </p> <p>The work ethic may have conditioned us to believe that you have to work really hard to earn money, and a lifetime of positive or negative money-related experiences can colour our view of our finances. </p> <p>'Some people have some shame around money,' says Cassidy. 'And there do seem to be people who feel they don't have any control over it.' </p> <p>One of her aims as a coach is to 'create lightness' around the subject. 'When I'm coaching, I'm standing in the middle of a river. A fish is coming down the river. I'm waiting for that fish and I will leap on it, explore it and rip that fish to shreds.' </p> <p>Quite. In researching this piece, salmon, bikes and streams were all popular metaphors. </p> <p>'It offers a soft-focus approach to money,' is how Cassidy regards life coaching and money. For the 'hard' bit, your life coach is likely to recommend a financial adviser. </p> <p>And even if you're fully invested, have your retirement plans sorted out and have never been overdrawn, life coaching can help you to do even greater things with your money. </p> <p>Indeed, as Shaby explains, while many people seek out a coach to help them to make big changes in their lives, at the same time there are thousands of others who get a coach after musing contentedly: 'Life's all right, but how could it be better?'</p> <p><strong>'Things felt bigger in my head than they were in life'</strong></p> <p>Jan (not her real name) is a university lecturer. She has been working with life coach Fiona Reed for 10 months. </p> <p>'Life coaching still feels terribly indulgent to me - it's so American and indulgent that a large part of the British population will think it's simpering and over the top. And yet, at the same time, it works.'</p> <p>Jan originally started working with Reed to help her to make better use of her time. 'Things felt bigger in my head than they were in real life,' she now realises.</p> <p>'If you go on a time-management course, once you're away from it, everything you've learnt goes. It's the ongoing nature of life coaching which seems to help people. It's regular and in short, sharp bursts.'</p> <p>Another area of her life which Jan wanted to sort out was her desk. 'You can't go to a therapist and say, \"I can't get my desk sorted,\" ' she says. 'But Fiona is much more practical than a therapist.' Desk tidying and paper sorting finally led to looking at money. Jan had never really looked at her finances before.</p> <p>'I knew I could bring down my mortgage and that I should be putting more into savings, but I thought I had to make the best decision, so I put it off.'</p> <p>Fiona recommended a financial adviser and Jan's homework one week was to call him. 'The only reason I did it was because I couldn't bear to tell Fiona that I hadn't done it.' When Jan finally met the financial adviser, she thought: 'He's going to think that I am the saddest person in the world.' With Reed's encouragement, Jan worked with the financial adviser, with remarkable results, which included renting out her flat overnight and discovering that she was due a payment of \u00a340,000 from a critical health policy.</p> <p>'Once I got started, I was on a roll. It was as if the universe fell into help,' is how she describes it. Jan believes she would never have got her life sorted out without Reed. 'She helps me prioritise and it doesn't seem like such a big deal.'</p> <p>Reed helped Jan discover that she constantly gave away her time by accepting invitations and helping people, but then felt exhausted when she didn't have enough time to herself. 'And Fiona was keen that I didn't do with my money what I usually did with my life.'</p> <p>The \u00a340,000 has now been invested for Jan's pension and retirement, and she has been able to invest in ethical funds - something she feels strongly about.</p> <p>'Now I know where my money is going, whereas before it got me tied in knots. There's a feeling of joy that I don't have to worry about it.'</p> <p><strong>'It's money well spent'</strong></p> <p>Anthony Nally is a hospital manager and works in private health-care. He started working with his life coach, Jadzia Kopiel, three years ago, when he was 'earning good money but spending a lot', he had amassed huge credit-card debts, and had completely given up opening bank statements. </p> <p>'The important thing around coaching and money was recognising that it was a symptom of other things not being right,' is how Nally sees it. 'My coach said I was using money as an excuse. It was a block. I couldn't confront this spending. It was a compulsive thing.'</p> <p>Working with Kopiel, Nally was able to recognise the role money was playing in his life. 'I managed a multi-million pound business but I couldn't manage my own money. I felt flawed.'</p> <p>By addressing his own beliefs around money, he was able to change his life. He left his job, paid off his debts, now has a long-term pension plan and is doing work he enjoys. 'Coaching gave me objective help, having someone who challenged me.'</p> <p>Nally's coaching started with the 'Clean Sweep' questionnaire. 'Although money wasn't one of my worst scores, my job was,' he admits. 'But I depended on the job for the money. I was constantly saying: \"I've got to stick at this job,\" and it was preventing me from planning ahead.'</p> <p>He spends \u00a3200 a month on four hours of phone calls with unlimited emails. 'It's money well spent.

      "bodyText": "Are you in denial about your pension, tax return and credit cards? Do 'don't go there' signs pop into your mind every time you consider sorting out your finances? Then you may benefit from a life coach. Life coaches help you assess your life now and work out how to change it to the way you want to be in future - fitter, happier and possibly richer. Getting a life coach may seem as indulgent as having a personal trainer to drag you out of bed to go jogging every morning, yet life coaching, which originated in the US, is gaining popularity in the UK. There are about 450 life coaches in this country, which means there are probably up to 20,000 people involved in life coaching, according to Aboodi Shaby, president of the International Coach Federation in the UK. He coaches 14 clients, spending hours on the phone with them each week. He also keeps up with clients via emails in between calls, as well as maintaining a website and writing a book. 'I'm not a guru, I'm not a magician, but I am keeping people on track,' he says. The coaching is rarely conducted face to face - so the next time you see a colleague sitting on a park bench at lunchtime, talking seriously into a mobile phone and nodding sagely, you could be witnessing a coaching session. Sometimes with as little as one half-hour telephone call each week, life coaches check in with their clients to support, encourage and galvanise people to continue with the commitments they have already made. But if you need to change your attitudes towards money - curbing compulsive spending and keeping to a budget while you pay off your debts - possibly the last thing you want to do is shell out up to \u00a3200 each month just to chat to someone whom you may have never met about how you can't stop money trickling through your fingers. And surely the best person to advise you on your finances is an independent financial adviser? But while a financial adviser may wheel out the latest on the best Tessa-only Isa, he's unlikely to truffle out what really trips you up when grappling with your finances. 'People have one or two issues about money,' explains coach Niki Cassidy. These issues could be related to how our parents perceived money: was it hard or easy to come by in your family home? The work ethic may have conditioned us to believe that you have to work really hard to earn money, and a lifetime of positive or negative money-related experiences can colour our view of our finances. 'Some people have some shame around money,' says Cassidy. 'And there do seem to be people who feel they don't have any control over it.' One of her aims as a coach is to 'create lightness' around the subject. 'When I'm coaching, I'm standing in the middle of a river. A fish is coming down the river. I'm waiting for that fish and I will leap on it, explore it and rip that fish to shreds.' Quite. In researching this piece, salmon, bikes and streams were all popular metaphors. 'It offers a soft-focus approach to money,' is how Cassidy regards life coaching and money. For the 'hard' bit, your life coach is likely to recommend a financial adviser. And even if you're fully invested, have your retirement plans sorted out and have never been overdrawn, life coaching can help you to do even greater things with your money. Indeed, as Shaby explains, while many people seek out a coach to help them to make big changes in their lives, at the same time there are thousands of others who get a coach after musing contentedly: 'Life's all right, but how could it be better?' 'Things felt bigger in my head than they were in life' Jan (not her real name) is a university lecturer. She has been working with life coach Fiona Reed for 10 months. 'Life coaching still feels terribly indulgent to me - it's so American and indulgent that a large part of the British population will think it's simpering and over the top. And yet, at the same time, it works.' Jan originally started working with Reed to help her to make better use of her time. 'Things felt bigger in my head than they were in real life,' she now realises. 'If you go on a time-management course, once you're away from it, everything you've learnt goes. It's the ongoing nature of life coaching which seems to help people. It's regular and in short, sharp bursts.' Another area of her life which Jan wanted to sort out was her desk. 'You can't go to a therapist and say, \"I can't get my desk sorted,\" ' she says. 'But Fiona is much more practical than a therapist.' Desk tidying and paper sorting finally led to looking at money. Jan had never really looked at her finances before. 'I knew I could bring down my mortgage and that I should be putting more into savings, but I thought I had to make the best decision, so I put it off.' Fiona recommended a financial adviser and Jan's homework one week was to call him. 'The only reason I did it was because I couldn't bear to tell Fiona that I hadn't done it.' When Jan finally met the financial adviser, she thought: 'He's going to think that I am the saddest person in the world.' With Reed's encouragement, Jan worked with the financial adviser, with remarkable results, which included renting out her flat overnight and discovering that she was due a payment of \u00a340,000 from a critical health policy. 'Once I got started, I was on a roll. It was as if the universe fell into help,' is how she describes it. Jan believes she would never have got her life sorted out without Reed. 'She helps me prioritise and it doesn't seem like such a big deal.' Reed helped Jan discover that she constantly gave away her time by accepting invitations and helping people, but then felt exhausted when she didn't have enough time to herself. 'And Fiona was keen that I didn't do with my money what I usually did with my life.' The \u00a340,000 has now been invested for Jan's pension and retirement, and she has been able to invest in ethical funds - something she feels strongly about. 'Now I know where my money is going, whereas before it got me tied in knots. There's a feeling of joy that I don't have to worry about it.' 'It's money well spent' Anthony Nally is a hospital manager and works in private health-care. He started working with his life coach, Jadzia Kopiel, three years ago, when he was 'earning good money but spending a lot', he had amassed huge credit-card debts, and had completely given up opening bank statements. 'The important thing around coaching and money was recognising that it was a symptom of other things not being right,' is how Nally sees it. 'My coach said I was using money as an excuse. It was a block. I couldn't confront this spending. It was a compulsive thing.' Working with Kopiel, Nally was able to recognise the role money was playing in his life. 'I managed a multi-million pound business but I couldn't manage my own money. I felt flawed.' By addressing his own beliefs around money, he was able to change his life. He left his job, paid off his debts, now has a long-term pension plan and is doing work he enjoys. 'Coaching gave me objective help, having someone who challenged me.' Nally's coaching started with the 'Clean Sweep' questionnaire. 'Although money wasn't one of my worst scores, my job was,' he admits. 'But I depended on the job for the money. I was constantly saying: \"I've got to stick at this job,\" and it was preventing me from planning ahead.' He spends \u00a3200 a month on four hours of phone calls with unlimited emails. 'It's money well spent. Coaching is about life balance, as it looks at environment, well-being, relationships and financial responsibilities.' So is it for you? Life coaches often take on pro-bono clients, so it's fairly easy to give a coach a whirl before you take them on. Fees range from \u00a330-\u00a350 an hour and coaching is by phone with email contact in between calls. The International Coach Federation in the UK is the professional body for coaches.

      "body": "<p>University lecturer Chris Bloom is diabetic but she works in a demanding environment, drives and is extremely active, controlling her condition with insulin. Yet when her annual travel insurance renewal with Europe Assistance came up this year it was refused. </p> <p>Bloom, not her real name, is not alone in experiencing difficulties. The British Insurance Brokers' Association (Biba) has noticed an increase in complaints from people with pre-existing medical conditions, who find themselves unable to get travel cover. Either that or they are forced to accept policy excesses of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000. </p> <p>'This shouldn't be happening,' says the Association of British Insurers. It believes the practices contravene new legislation designed to protect the disabled from discrimination. </p> <p>But a mystery shopping exercise by Holiday Which? , the consumer magazine, has found some insurers more helpful than others towards people with pre-existing conditions. It will be naming and shaming the worst offenders in the March issue. </p> <p>'Some insurers operate a blanket ban on pre-existing conditions,' says assistant editor Roger Lakin. Boots, among others, will not automatically give cover to anyone who has been on a prescription medicine in the past 12 months, according to insurer TravelPlan Direct. If you take medicine for flu in the winter, you may not be able to find insurance the following summer. </p> <p>Any problems with your heart or lungs will make it tricky to find insurance, as will a diagnosis of cancer. You are also likely to encounter problems should you plan to travel against your GP's advice. </p> <p>Outside these cases there is a surprising lack of consensus as to what constitutes a pre-existing condition. Travel policies can be woolly in their definitions, using terms such as 'blood conditions' or 'psychiatric disorders'. You may also be refused cover if you have had 'medical treatment' in the two years preceding the trip or are awaiting an operation. Pregnancy can also cast you into the insurance wilderness. </p> <p>Most insurers have a helpline where you can find out where you stand. The more open you are, the more likely you are to get turned away. But before you think about keeping quiet, check out the small print to see if your condition is among the exclusions. If it is and you fall ill when away, the insurance policy will not pay out. </p> <p>Why the sudden difficulty in insuring pre-existing conditions? Biba puts it down to the entry into the market of companies selling insurance direct. 'Their off-the-shelf policies are not specialised - it is like going to Ikea,' says Biba spokeswoman Jennifer Weller. Other companies are said to be tightening up their policies due to an increase in complaints as more people travel. Biba recommends that those with pre-existing conditions go to a specialist provider. </p> <p>Nearly two-thirds of people still buy travel insurance from a travel agent, but a travel agent is not an expert on such policies. He will get a fat commission cheque to boot. 'Travel agents are the last place you should go for you holiday insurance,' says Paul Charles of online broker screentrade.co.uk. 'You are more likely to be ripped off.' Biba can put you in touch with a specialist broker who will have access to a wide selection of products. </p> <p>But Mrs Bloom does not feel specialists offer a solution. She says: 'I am suspicious of the specialists. I think they load the premiums.' One agreed to insure her for a four-day holiday in France - for \u00a3140. </p> <p>Pre-existing conditions do tend to push up the cost of cover. Premiums will depend on the condition and how old you are. Which ? magazine says to try mainstream insurers first because they may cover you at no extra charge. Failing that, it advises you to persevere.

      "bodyText": "University lecturer Chris Bloom is diabetic but she works in a demanding environment, drives and is extremely active, controlling her condition with insulin. Yet when her annual travel insurance renewal with Europe Assistance came up this year it was refused. Bloom, not her real name, is not alone in experiencing difficulties. The British Insurance Brokers' Association (Biba) has noticed an increase in complaints from people with pre-existing medical conditions, who find themselves unable to get travel cover. Either that or they are forced to accept policy excesses of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000. 'This shouldn't be happening,' says the Association of British Insurers. It believes the practices contravene new legislation designed to protect the disabled from discrimination. But a mystery shopping exercise by Holiday Which? , the consumer magazine, has found some insurers more helpful than others towards people with pre-existing conditions. It will be naming and shaming the worst offenders in the March issue. 'Some insurers operate a blanket ban on pre-existing conditions,' says assistant editor Roger Lakin. Boots, among others, will not automatically give cover to anyone who has been on a prescription medicine in the past 12 months, according to insurer TravelPlan Direct. If you take medicine for flu in the winter, you may not be able to find insurance the following summer. Any problems with your heart or lungs will make it tricky to find insurance, as will a diagnosis of cancer. You are also likely to encounter problems should you plan to travel against your GP's advice. Outside these cases there is a surprising lack of consensus as to what constitutes a pre-existing condition. Travel policies can be woolly in their definitions, using terms such as 'blood conditions' or 'psychiatric disorders'. You may also be refused cover if you have had 'medical treatment' in the two years preceding the trip or are awaiting an operation. Pregnancy can also cast you into the insurance wilderness. Most insurers have a helpline where you can find out where you stand. The more open you are, the more likely you are to get turned away. But before you think about keeping quiet, check out the small print to see if your condition is among the exclusions. If it is and you fall ill when away, the insurance policy will not pay out. Why the sudden difficulty in insuring pre-existing conditions? Biba puts it down to the entry into the market of companies selling insurance direct. 'Their off-the-shelf policies are not specialised - it is like going to Ikea,' says Biba spokeswoman Jennifer Weller. Other companies are said to be tightening up their policies due to an increase in complaints as more people travel. Biba recommends that those with pre-existing conditions go to a specialist provider. Nearly two-thirds of people still buy travel insurance from a travel agent, but a travel agent is not an expert on such policies. He will get a fat commission cheque to boot. 'Travel agents are the last place you should go for you holiday insurance,' says Paul Charles of online broker screentrade.co.uk. 'You are more likely to be ripped off.' Biba can put you in touch with a specialist broker who will have access to a wide selection of products. But Mrs Bloom does not feel specialists offer a solution. She says: 'I am suspicious of the specialists. I think they load the premiums.' One agreed to insure her for a four-day holiday in France - for \u00a3140. Pre-existing conditions do tend to push up the cost of cover. Premiums will depend on the condition and how old you are. Which ? magazine says to try mainstream insurers first because they may cover you at no extra charge. Failing that, it advises you to persevere. 'One man with mild angina was first offered a \u00a310,000 policy excess, then a premium of \u00a3600 before finding one for \u00a340.' You can complain to the Association of British Insurers via their website. The association is currently consulting to produce a set of guidelines on the disabled for the insurance industry. Don't exclude yourself Mediquote in Chichester, which says it does not believe in exclusions and will endeavour to find you insurance as long as your condition is 'stable' and suitable for your proposed itinerary, has this advice for people with pre-existing conditions wanting to travel: \u0095 Plan ahead - don't leave it until the day before you go away to look for travel insurance. \u0095 Speak to your doctor to see if she thinks you are fit to travel. \u0095 Get comparative quotes. Premiums vary a great deal. \u0095 Avoid big policy excesses. \u0095 Get the insurer to put in writing the terms under which your cover has been extended.",

But Anne is not keen: 'It costs him money and then there is all the palaver involved.' Her father pays \u00a382 a year for his permit from the borough of Camden and a minimum of 40p an hour for guests. </p> <p>But going to see her mother in Golders Green is far easier. Instead of operating parking restrictions throughout the day, the borough of Barnet deters commuters from parking on residential roads by enforcing restrictions for just one hour in the middle of the day. This means that a commuter who used to leave the car all day near Golders Green station and use the Underground for the rest of the journey cannot do so any longer. </p> <p>But shoppers and visitors who want to park for part of the day can still do so for nothing if they avoid the restricted hour. Anne's mother pays \u00a320 a year for her permit - and she also gets a book of 10 free guest-parking vouchers. </p> <p>Both these schemes have been in place for a few years. In that time many other controlled parking zones (CPZs) have been set up in towns and cities throughout the country, and many more are planned. </p> <p>But surprisingly little is known about them. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) is responsible for road planning but does not keep a record of the number of CPZs. And there appears to be no lobbying group to look after the interests of local residents and businesses. </p> <p>Lobbying group Transport 2000, a fervent champion of the ordinary citizen, is basically very keen on parking controls. 'They are effective mechanisms in terms of controlling traffic,' says spokesman Steve Hounsham. 'We are in favour of charging people to park and using these sticks to encourage people to use public transport, walk and cycle.' </p> <p>Local authorities are required under the Road Traffic Regulations Act 1984 to consult with the police, fire brigade, road-haulage industry and other interested parties if they are planning a CPZ. They are also encouraged by the DETR to consult local residents, but they could fulfil this statutory duty with a notice in the local paper. Most authorities do more than this, and are very likely to put notices up on the roads affected. </p> <p>The London Borough of Haringey held open days staffed by local officials, with maps of the proposed schemes and a ballot box for people to cast their vote. But local government specialist Celia Cullen of solicitor Eversheds says: 'Councils have to consider objections but they don't have to act on those objections.' </p> <p>The London Borough of Hackney has just introduced a controversial CPZ near Finsbury Park. Restrictions apply six days a week from early morning to mid-evening. Residents are charged \u00a350 a year for a permit. Margot Sreberny, president of the Finsbury Park Action Group, says: 'They consulted with the people, who said, \"No, we don't want it\", and we got it immediately.' Few people complain about the \u00a350 charge, she says, but it does disrupt ordinary life if visitors have difficulty parking. </p> <p>Many local authorities will feel under pressure to follow suit if a CPZ is set up in an adjacent area. As Steve Hounsham of Transport 2000 says: 'It has to be done in a very co-ordinated and comprehensive manner. There is no point in having restrictions in one street if everyone can park in the next street.' This may be why some schemes do seem to be railroaded through. If people really want to challenge proposals, they can apply for a judicial review or complain to the Local Gov ernment Ombudsman (0845 602 1983). But the Ombudsman says nobody has yet complained. </p> <p>But 'people power' does work sometimes. Michael Lewer QC led a successful campaign to keep his road out of the new Finsbury Park CPZ. He called a meeting of residents, who voted 31-1 against the scheme. The crucial factor seems to be that he persuaded a local councillor to attend the meeting and witness the vote. He says: 'Hackney could hardly deny the result because there had been a councillor there.' </p> <p>Tempers can run high in consultations on CPZs. Vince Christie of the Local Government Association says: 'One of the problems is that there are large numbers of people who think they should get priority over others - taxis, buses, disabled drivers, residents, people using delivery bays and, in holiday areas, caravans. These pressures are always there and they are not getting any easier.' </p> <p>CPZs aside, motorists could be faced with two new kinds of financial penalties within the next few years: congestion-charging schemes and workplace-charging schemes. </p> <p>The DETR is gearing up to introduce these under the Transport Act 2000. Guidelines for local authorities are unlikely to appear before the end of the year: this is not the sort of issue the government will want aired before an election. Some schemes may start next year, but transport specialists expect it to be three or four years before they are commonplace. </p> <p>London Mayor Ken Livingstone's plans for congestion charging on motorists who drive into the centre of London are well known. Schemes could be fairly easy to set up, especially in small cities with a limited number of entry roads to the centre. </p> <p>Under workplace-charging schemes, local authorities will be able to charge employers a daily rate for each parking space they own. It will then be up to employers whether they pass on the cost to employees. </p> <p>Neither plan is compulsory - and many local authorities will not introduce either. Authorities would need to get clearance from the DETR. There is no cap in the legislation on charges but Transport 2000 thinks \u00a35 is a likely charge for both schemes. </p> <p>As the DETR envisages it, local authorities would have to improve public transport first to give motorists an alternative if they no longer want to drive. </p> <p>Many authorities are already increasing charges for ordinary car parks in a bid to force drivers to switch to buses.

      "body": "<p>WHETHER you are buying or selling a home it's important to be specific about what is included in the deal. </p> <p>The term 'fixtures and fittings' is open to interpretation. This has been argued in the courts over the centuries, but our modern-day obsession with home improvement may cloud the issue. A fitted kitchen is definitely a fixture, but television celebrity chefs have made free-standing units and ovens on wheels the latest must-haves. Likewise, plug-in lighting units and uplighters have usurped the traditional ceiling rose and light socket. They are not fixtures in the legal sense, but couldbecome a stumbling block to a sale. </p> <p>'The trend for free-standing, rather than fitted, appliances and furniture has had an effect on the interior design and specification of city apartments,' said Angela South, sales and marketing director of city developer Nicholson Estates. </p> <p>'Many of today's purchasers treat the fridge-freezer as furniture and prefer to supply their own favourite model. They do expect, however, to have fitted dishwashers, ovens and hobs. In all our apartments we have moved away from fixed ceiling lights and install designer wall lights that complement whatever free-standing lighting the purchaser might choose.' </p> <p>According to Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy of the National Association of Estate Agents, items may appear fixed but the seller may wish to take them when they leave. A typical example might be bookshelves. If purchaser and seller agree that these can be removed, the deal should include any making-good, or the price should reflect the need for redecoration. </p> <p>Attitudes to fixtures and fittings reflect the overall state of the property market, says Dunsmore-Hardy: 'When the market goes into a slacker period and people's price expectations are not being maintained, they are more likely to say \"Well, in that case, I'm taking this, this and this with me\".' </p> <p>Items that are contained in the estate agents' particulars, such as made-to-measure curtains, would normally be seen as forming part of the deal and the price. But it always pays to check. This can be done through the solicitor handling the deal, who may be following the Law Society's Transaction protocol, which includes a contents list being supplied by the seller. </p> <p>Another area to watch out for is the modern designer garden. This is a potential minefield, given the fashion for paved patios where plants are contained in smart and expensive pots. </p> <p>The Government's Homes Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, paves the way for the introduction of a compulsory 'seller's pack' in 2003, designed to hold all pertinent details, such as the definitive list of what is included in the price, and even a survey. 'There's an old case that involved a tapestry being nailed to the wall and was therefore a fixture,' said solicitor Roger Wilson. 'If you go back enough years, even floorboards were loose so you could remove them.' </p> <p>If as purchaser you are particularly attracted to an item it's worth asking if it is included in the price, or whether it can be purchased separately. </p> <p>If it is not a fixture but an item that could be taken by the seller, negotiating a sep arate deal may make financial sense: stamp duty is payable at 1 per cent on a total house purchase price of more than \u00a360,000. On properties that sell for more than \u00a3250,000 it is 3 per cent and and on sales exceeding \u00a3500,000 it is 4 per cent. Taking things like curtains out of the purchase price can make a significant tax saving if it brings you below the next tax level. </p> <p>But Wilson warns against playing fast and loose with the fixtures definition. 'You can put a reasonable price on carpets, curtains and even curtain rails and the Inland Revenue will normally accept that. A typical figure would be \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000, although in London it may well be \u00a310,000. But you invite questions if you just magic a figure simply to save tax.' </p> <p>Another potential problem, which also reflects our current obsession with home style, is the lack of difference designer fixtures may actually make to the selling price. </p> <p>They may affect a home's saleability, but the fact that you have chosen designer bathroom taps or restored the Victorian originals will not result in a higher sale price, according to Jeremy Leaf, housing market spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. A major renovation or extension may affect the price but you would still not recoup the actual cost. </p> <p>When it comes to items that could be removed by the seller, more desirable items can be used as a way of maximising the selling price. The inference being that if the asking price is not paid, these items will be removed. </p> <p>Using these fittings to smooth a sale may help the seller. The designer curtains in the lounge may not fit or match the intended colour scheme or ambience of their new home. The buyer still gets a bargain as these second hand items are a good deal. </p> <p>'It may even be that you've always hated the Laura Ashley curtains in the lounge and can't wait to get rid of them,' said Leaf.</p>",

This has been argued in the courts over the centuries, but our modern-day obsession with home improvement may cloud the issue. A fitted kitchen is definitely a fixture, but television celebrity chefs have made free-standing units and ovens on wheels the latest must-haves. Likewise, plug-in lighting units and uplighters have usurped the traditional ceiling rose and light socket. They are not fixtures in the legal sense, but couldbecome a stumbling block to a sale. 'The trend for free-standing, rather than fitted, appliances and furniture has had an effect on the interior design and specification of city apartments,' said Angela South, sales and marketing director of city developer Nicholson Estates. 'Many of today's purchasers treat the fridge-freezer as furniture and prefer to supply their own favourite model. They do expect, however, to have fitted dishwashers, ovens and hobs. In all our apartments we have moved away from fixed ceiling lights and install designer wall lights that complement whatever free-standing lighting the purchaser might choose.' According to Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy of the National Association of Estate Agents, items may appear fixed but the seller may wish to take them when they leave. A typical example might be bookshelves. If purchaser and seller agree that these can be removed, the deal should include any making-good, or the price should reflect the need for redecoration. Attitudes to fixtures and fittings reflect the overall state of the property market, says Dunsmore-Hardy: 'When the market goes into a slacker period and people's price expectations are not being maintained, they are more likely to say \"Well, in that case, I'm taking this, this and this with me\".' Items that are contained in the estate agents' particulars, such as made-to-measure curtains, would normally be seen as forming part of the deal and the price. But it always pays to check. This can be done through the solicitor handling the deal, who may be following the Law Society's Transaction protocol, which includes a contents list being supplied by the seller. Another area to watch out for is the modern designer garden. This is a potential minefield, given the fashion for paved patios where plants are contained in smart and expensive pots. The Government's Homes Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, paves the way for the introduction of a compulsory 'seller's pack' in 2003, designed to hold all pertinent details, such as the definitive list of what is included in the price, and even a survey. 'There's an old case that involved a tapestry being nailed to the wall and was therefore a fixture,' said solicitor Roger Wilson. 'If you go back enough years, even floorboards were loose so you could remove them.' If as purchaser you are particularly attracted to an item it's worth asking if it is included in the price, or whether it can be purchased separately. If it is not a fixture but an item that could be taken by the seller, negotiating a sep arate deal may make financial sense: stamp duty is payable at 1 per cent on a total house purchase price of more than \u00a360,000. On properties that sell for more than \u00a3250,000 it is 3 per cent and and on sales exceeding \u00a3500,000 it is 4 per cent. Taking things like curtains out of the purchase price can make a significant tax saving if it brings you below the next tax level. But Wilson warns against playing fast and loose with the fixtures definition. 'You can put a reasonable price on carpets, curtains and even curtain rails and the Inland Revenue will normally accept that. A typical figure would be \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000, although in London it may well be \u00a310,000. But you invite questions if you just magic a figure simply to save tax.' Another potential problem, which also reflects our current obsession with home style, is the lack of difference designer fixtures may actually make to the selling price. They may affect a home's saleability, but the fact that you have chosen designer bathroom taps or restored the Victorian originals will not result in a higher sale price, according to Jeremy Leaf, housing market spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. A major renovation or extension may affect the price but you would still not recoup the actual cost. When it comes to items that could be removed by the seller, more desirable items can be used as a way of maximising the selling price. The inference being that if the asking price is not paid, these items will be removed. Using these fittings to smooth a sale may help the seller. The designer curtains in the lounge may not fit or match the intended colour scheme or ambience of their new home. The buyer still gets a bargain as these second hand items are a good deal. 'It may even be that you've always hated the Laura Ashley curtains in the lounge and can't wait to get rid of them,' said Leaf.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Gilts</strong><br> </p> <p> Gilts are bonds or 'IOUs' issued by the Government when it needs to borrow. Each gilt, sold in denominations of \u00a3100, has a coupon that shows the rate of interest earned if held from issue to maturity. </p> <p> <strong> Typical yield</strong> 5 per cent gross. </p> <p> <strong> Advantages</strong> Can be bought easily and cheaply through the Post Office. You know exactly how much income you will get each year provided you hold the gilt until maturity. </p> <p> <strong> Disadvantages</strong> On maturity you will be paid the nominal value of the gilt - \u00a3100. As most gilts are selling for more, you will inevitably lose some capital. </p> <p>Better rates of interest are paid on bank and building society accounts. </p> <p> <strong> Suitable for</strong> Investors who are wary of the stock market and want to know exactly what they will get in returns. </p> <p> <strong> Recommendations</strong> Treasury 7.25 per cent 2007 (matures in 2007 and has a coupon of 7.25 per cent), which costs about \u00a3112 and has a redemption yield of 5.1 per cent. Treasury 7.5 per cent 2006, price \u00a3112, redemption yield 5.2 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Equity income unit trusts</strong><br> </p> <p> Unit trusts and open-ended investment companies pool investors' money to buy a large number of shares. Unit trusts and Oeics are split into equal units or shares, which move in line with the value of underlying assets. Income funds tend either to invest in shares that pay a good dividend or in a mixture of bonds (for income) and shares (for capital growth). </p> <p> <strong> Typical yield</strong> 3 per cent. </p> <p> <strong> Advantages </strong> The value of the fund and your investment should increase over time, and the income generated should also rise. This is a much less risky route than buying the shares of a few companies with your own money. </p> <p> <strong> Disadvantages</strong> Income is comparatively low. Equity income funds that advertise a much higher yield tend to invest in a more risky portfolio and are unlikely to produce any capital growth. Level of income not guaranteed. </p> <p> <strong> Suitable for</strong> People beginning their retirement who can afford to accept a low income at outset but need their income to grow and keep pace with inflation. </p> <p> <strong> Recommendations</strong> HSBC Income (yield 2.92 per cent), Newton Higher Income (3.62 per cent), Credit Suisse Income (3.33 per cent), ABN-Amro Equity Income (3.66 per cent). </p> <p><strong> Investment trusts</strong><br> </p> <p> Investment trusts also pool the money of lots of investors to buy a wide range of shares. However, investment trusts are structured as companies, with a limited number of shares listed on the stock market, which increases risk. Investment trust shares can sell for less than the value of underlying assets - this is described as at a discount to the net asset value. This can be good for share buyers, who get more assets for their money. </p> <p>However, investment trust shares designed to produce income are in great demand, so usually sell at a 'premium' to net asset value. </p> <p> <strong> Typical yield:</strong> Typically 4 per cent; 10 per cent for average split-capital income shares. </p> <p> <strong> Advantages:</strong> The lowest charges of any investment product. Many have no initial charge and a low management charge, about 0.2 per cent. </p> <p> <strong> Disadvantages:</strong> Investment trusts can be hard to understand, income is not guaranteed, and share prices can be volatile. </p> <p> <strong> Suitable for:</strong> Those who want a growing but slightly higher income than that from equity income unit trusts. Definitely not suitable for nervous investors. </p> <p> <strong> Recommendations:</strong> Conventionalo: Invesco Convertible (yield 4 per cent), Friends Ivory &amp; Sime Optimum (6.7 per cent), Perpetual Income &amp; Growth (3.3 per cent). Split income shares: Dresdner RCM Income Growth (6.6 per cent), Jupiter Enhanced Income (8.1 per cent). </p> <p><strong> With-profits bonds</strong><br> </p> <p> This is a single premium investment into an insurance company's with-profits fund. Every year the fund allocates an annual bonus. This is guaranteed and once added to your policy, cannot be taken away. Funds invest in equities, bonds and gilts, and property. To protect investors from stock-market volatility, the fund manager holds over some of the returns from good years to boost bonuses in poor years - smoothing. The insurer will also usually add a final or terminal bonus when the bond is cashed in. </p> <p>Normally investors can make withdrawals of up to 7.5 per cent a year net of basic-rate tax without penalty, and the first 5 per cent can be taken without paying any extra tax - even by higher-rate taxpayers. </p> <p> <strong> Typical yield</strong> 5 per cent net (plus a terminal bonus which can be regarded as growth). </p> <p> <strong> Advantages</strong> A good way to benefit from equity returns without exposure to the full volatility of the stock market. </p> <p> <strong> Disadvantages</strong> Encashment of a bond within the first five years can incur heavy penalties of up to 9 per cent of the amount invested. Encashment during or just after a market crash may result in the insurer applying a 'market value adjustor' or down- valuation to the investment. Non-taxpayers cannot re-claim tax paid. </p> <p> <strong> Suitable for</strong> A cautious investor willing to tie up money for at least five years. Particularly attractive for higher-rate taxpayers who expect to be basic-rate taxpayers by the time their bond is fully encashed. </p> <p> <strong> Recommendations</strong> Liverpool Victoria, Prudential, Norwich Union. </p> <p><strong> Distribution bonds</strong><br> </p> <p> This is a lump-sum investment in an insurance fund managed for income. Your money is used to buy units in the fund, which are split into a capital portion and income earned on it. The income is siphoned off and paid out twice a year. Distribution funds invest in a mix of shares, gilts, property and cash, which provide income as dividends, interest and rent. The value of your investment can fluctuate depending on the asset mix chosen by the fund manager. </p> <p>Like all insurance bonds, returns are taxed within the fund and basic-rate taxpayers have no further tax to pay on distributions. Charges vary, but most funds will have an initial charge or an estab lishment charge spread over five years of about 5 per cent in total and an annual management charge of 1 per cent. </p> <p> <strong> Typical yield </strong> 4.5 per cent net. </p> <p> <strong> Advantages</strong> Less risky than a pure equity-based trust, but likely to outperform a with-profits fund in a rising market. </p> <p> <strong> Disadvantages</strong> Unlike a with-profits bond, value can fall according to the performance of the underlying assets. Neither the rate of income or return of capital is guaranteed. Withdrawal charges in the first five years. </p> <p> <strong> Suitable for </strong> Fairly conservative investors. </p> <p> <strong> Recommendations </strong> Sun Life (5.06 per cent net). </p> <p><strong> Guaranteed income bonds</strong><br> </p> <p> A GIB is a lump-sum investment that guarantees a fixed rate of return during the life of the bond, plus return on capital provided you leave it for the agreed term. Investors should choose a bond purely on the basis of the income rate offered. Interest is paid net of basic-rate tax. </p> <p> <strong> Typical yield</strong> 4.5 per cent to 5.2 per cent net, depending on amount and term. </p> <p> <strong> Advantages</strong> Returns are guaranteed. Higher-rate taxpayers are liable to pay extra tax, but the calculation is based on net interest, unlike bank and building society deposit accounts, where it is based on gross interest. This means higher-rate payers incur less tax. </p> <p> <strong> Disadvantages</strong> Tax can't be reclaimed by non-taxpayers. </p> <p> <strong> Suitable for</strong> Cautious in-vestors needing level income. </p> <p> <strong> Recommendations</strong> Three-year bonds offer best value. AIG pays 4.87 per cent net for <strong> </strong> \u00a310,000 and 5.12 per cent net for \u00a340,000. </p> <p> * Yields quoted gross of tax unless otherwise stated</p> <p>\u0095 Recommendations from: Baronworth Investment Services, Brooks Macdonald Gayer, Chartwell, Chase de Vere, David Aaron Partnership, Informed Choice, Nelson Money Managers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gilts Gilts are bonds or 'IOUs' issued by the Government when it needs to borrow. Each gilt, sold in denominations of \u00a3100, has a coupon that shows the rate of interest earned if held from issue to maturity. Typical yield 5 per cent gross. Advantages Can be bought easily and cheaply through the Post Office. You know exactly how much income you will get each year provided you hold the gilt until maturity. Disadvantages On maturity you will be paid the nominal value of the gilt - \u00a3100. As most gilts are selling for more, you will inevitably lose some capital. Better rates of interest are paid on bank and building society accounts. Suitable for Investors who are wary of the stock market and want to know exactly what they will get in returns. Recommendations Treasury 7.25 per cent 2007 (matures in 2007 and has a coupon of 7.25 per cent), which costs about \u00a3112 and has a redemption yield of 5.1 per cent. Treasury 7.5 per cent 2006, price \u00a3112, redemption yield 5.2 per cent. Equity income unit trusts Unit trusts and open-ended investment companies pool investors' money to buy a large number of shares. Unit trusts and Oeics are split into equal units or shares, which move in line with the value of underlying assets. Income funds tend either to invest in shares that pay a good dividend or in a mixture of bonds (for income) and shares (for capital growth). Typical yield 3 per cent. Advantages The value of the fund and your investment should increase over time, and the income generated should also rise. This is a much less risky route than buying the shares of a few companies with your own money. Disadvantages Income is comparatively low. Equity income funds that advertise a much higher yield tend to invest in a more risky portfolio and are unlikely to produce any capital growth. Level of income not guaranteed. Suitable for People beginning their retirement who can afford to accept a low income at outset but need their income to grow and keep pace with inflation. Recommendations HSBC Income (yield 2.92 per cent), Newton Higher Income (3.62 per cent), Credit Suisse Income (3.33 per cent), ABN-Amro Equity Income (3.66 per cent). Investment trusts Investment trusts also pool the money of lots of investors to buy a wide range of shares. However, investment trusts are structured as companies, with a limited number of shares listed on the stock market, which increases risk. Investment trust shares can sell for less than the value of underlying assets - this is described as at a discount to the net asset value. This can be good for share buyers, who get more assets for their money. However, investment trust shares designed to produce income are in great demand, so usually sell at a 'premium' to net asset value. Typical yield: Typically 4 per cent; 10 per cent for average split-capital income shares. Advantages: The lowest charges of any investment product. Many have no initial charge and a low management charge, about 0.2 per cent. Disadvantages: Investment trusts can be hard to understand, income is not guaranteed, and share prices can be volatile. Suitable for: Those who want a growing but slightly higher income than that from equity income unit trusts. Definitely not suitable for nervous investors. Recommendations: Conventionalo: Invesco Convertible (yield 4 per cent), Friends Ivory &amp; Sime Optimum (6.7 per cent), Perpetual Income &amp; Growth (3.3 per cent). Split income shares: Dresdner RCM Income Growth (6.6 per cent), Jupiter Enhanced Income (8.1 per cent). With-profits bonds This is a single premium investment into an insurance company's with-profits fund. Every year the fund allocates an annual bonus. This is guaranteed and once added to your policy, cannot be taken away. Funds invest in equities, bonds and gilts, and property. To protect investors from stock-market volatility, the fund manager holds over some of the returns from good years to boost bonuses in poor years - smoothing. The insurer will also usually add a final or terminal bonus when the bond is cashed in. Normally investors can make withdrawals of up to 7.5 per cent a year net of basic-rate tax without penalty, and the first 5 per cent can be taken without paying any extra tax - even by higher-rate taxpayers. Typical yield 5 per cent net (plus a terminal bonus which can be regarded as growth). Advantages A good way to benefit from equity returns without exposure to the full volatility of the stock market. Disadvantages Encashment of a bond within the first five years can incur heavy penalties of up to 9 per cent of the amount invested. Encashment during or just after a market crash may result in the insurer applying a 'market value adjustor' or down- valuation to the investment. Non-taxpayers cannot re-claim tax paid. Suitable for A cautious investor willing to tie up money for at least five years. Particularly attractive for higher-rate taxpayers who expect to be basic-rate taxpayers by the time their bond is fully encashed. Recommendations Liverpool Victoria, Prudential, Norwich Union. Distribution bonds This is a lump-sum investment in an insurance fund managed for income. Your money is used to buy units in the fund, which are split into a capital portion and income earned on it. The income is siphoned off and paid out twice a year. Distribution funds invest in a mix of shares, gilts, property and cash, which provide income as dividends, interest and rent. The value of your investment can fluctuate depending on the asset mix chosen by the fund manager. Like all insurance bonds, returns are taxed within the fund and basic-rate taxpayers have no further tax to pay on distributions. Charges vary, but most funds will have an initial charge or an estab lishment charge spread over five years of about 5 per cent in total and an annual management charge of 1 per cent. Typical yield 4.5 per cent net. Advantages Less risky than a pure equity-based trust, but likely to outperform a with-profits fund in a rising market. Disadvantages Unlike a with-profits bond, value can fall according to the performance of the underlying assets. Neither the rate of income or return of capital is guaranteed. Withdrawal charges in the first five years. Suitable for Fairly conservative investors. Recommendations Sun Life (5.06 per cent net). Guaranteed income bonds A GIB is a lump-sum investment that guarantees a fixed rate of return during the life of the bond, plus return on capital provided you leave it for the agreed term. Investors should choose a bond purely on the basis of the income rate offered. Interest is paid net of basic-rate tax. Typical yield 4.5 per cent to 5.2 per cent net, depending on amount and term. Advantages Returns are guaranteed. Higher-rate taxpayers are liable to pay extra tax, but the calculation is based on net interest, unlike bank and building society deposit accounts, where it is based on gross interest. This means higher-rate payers incur less tax. Disadvantages Tax can't be reclaimed by non-taxpayers. Suitable for Cautious in-vestors needing level income. Recommendations Three-year bonds offer best value. AIG pays 4.87 per cent net for \u00a310,000 and 5.12 per cent net for \u00a340,000. * Yields quoted gross of tax unless otherwise stated \u0095 Recommendations from: Baronworth Investment Services, Brooks Macdonald Gayer, Chartwell, Chase de Vere, David Aaron Partnership, Informed Choice, Nelson Money Managers.",

      "body": "<p>If you rely on investment income, you must feel like you're caught between a rock and a hard place. </p> <p>The base rate has been below 6 per cent since the end of 1999, and most bank and building society deposit accounts have paid much less. At the same time, share income is low. The average gross yield produced by the FTSE All Share is 2.37 per cent. The cuts on with-profits bond annual bonuses is just salt in the wound. </p> <p>However, as anyone who has read Cash 's guides to fixing your finances over the past eight weeks will know, it is always possible to make your money work harder. In the last of the series, we look at how a little rejigging of your investments can increase your income. </p> <p>Most income investors are near or at retirement; your instinct may be to leave everything in a deposit account. That's fine if capital security is the most important thing to you, but make sure you are earning the best rate available. Check the <a href=\"http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk\">Moneyfacts website</a> for latest rates. </p> <p>Janine Starks of Bath independent financial adviser Chase de Vere says your approach to producing income should be based on the amount you have to invest, your attitude to risk, and how long you are likely to need an income. If you have few savings, you cannot afford to lose any, and should stick to low-risk investments such as building society deposits and guaranteed income bonds. If the idea of investing on the stock market is going to keep you awake at night, don't do it. And if you are at the beginning of your retirement, you need to take care of your capital and ensure income keeps pace with inflation. </p> <p>Ideally, you should aim for a mix - deposits and guaranteed income bonds to provide security, corporate bonds and gilts to provide a reasonable level of income, and equities (via unit trusts, Oeics and investment trusts) for capital growth. If that sounds like hard work, consider investments designed to satisfy all three needs through one professionally managed portfolio of assets, such as with-profits bonds and distribution bonds. </p> <p>Organising a portfolio of investments for income can be tricky; if you don't want to do it yourself, employ an independent financial adviser. Some charge between \u00a350 and \u00a3200 an hour but you should be able to negotiate a rebate of commission on any products you buy through them. </p> <p>Finally, be realistic. Nelson Money Managers' David Hanratty says the level of income you are able to earn at the moment may seem low - about 5 per cent on many bonds and gilts - but then so is inflation - 1.5 per cent excluding mortgage interest rates. 'This gives you a real return [the amount after inflation] of 3.5 per cent,' he says. 'That's a good yield historically - the average real return for gilts since 1918 is 2.3 per cent. And you can earn that with absolutely no risk to your capital if you hold your gilt to maturity. Income investors have got it pretty good at the moment, all things considered.'</p> <p><strong>How to invest for success</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Register as a non-taxpayer. IFA Promotion estimates that \u00a3300m will be lost this year through unnecessary tax paid on savings accounts. If you are eligible to earn untaxed interest, ask your bank or building society for an R85 form. </p> <p>\u0095 Watch the interest rate paid on your savings accounts. Many lenders offer a high headline rate only to drop it a few months later.</p> <p>\u0095 Keep tabs on the performance of equity and bond investments. Make sure you know if one of your fund managers is changing jobs or has gone off the boil, and ask your independent financial adviser whether you should consider switching funds.</p> <p>\u0095 Maximise use of your annual Isa allowance.

      "bodyText": "If you rely on investment income, you must feel like you're caught between a rock and a hard place. The base rate has been below 6 per cent since the end of 1999, and most bank and building society deposit accounts have paid much less. At the same time, share income is low. The average gross yield produced by the FTSE All Share is 2.37 per cent. The cuts on with-profits bond annual bonuses is just salt in the wound. However, as anyone who has read Cash 's guides to fixing your finances over the past eight weeks will know, it is always possible to make your money work harder. In the last of the series, we look at how a little rejigging of your investments can increase your income. Most income investors are near or at retirement; your instinct may be to leave everything in a deposit account. That's fine if capital security is the most important thing to you, but make sure you are earning the best rate available. Check the Moneyfacts website for latest rates. Janine Starks of Bath independent financial adviser Chase de Vere says your approach to producing income should be based on the amount you have to invest, your attitude to risk, and how long you are likely to need an income. If you have few savings, you cannot afford to lose any, and should stick to low-risk investments such as building society deposits and guaranteed income bonds. If the idea of investing on the stock market is going to keep you awake at night, don't do it. And if you are at the beginning of your retirement, you need to take care of your capital and ensure income keeps pace with inflation. Ideally, you should aim for a mix - deposits and guaranteed income bonds to provide security, corporate bonds and gilts to provide a reasonable level of income, and equities (via unit trusts, Oeics and investment trusts) for capital growth. If that sounds like hard work, consider investments designed to satisfy all three needs through one professionally managed portfolio of assets, such as with-profits bonds and distribution bonds. Organising a portfolio of investments for income can be tricky; if you don't want to do it yourself, employ an independent financial adviser. Some charge between \u00a350 and \u00a3200 an hour but you should be able to negotiate a rebate of commission on any products you buy through them. Finally, be realistic. Nelson Money Managers' David Hanratty says the level of income you are able to earn at the moment may seem low - about 5 per cent on many bonds and gilts - but then so is inflation - 1.5 per cent excluding mortgage interest rates. 'This gives you a real return [the amount after inflation] of 3.5 per cent,' he says. 'That's a good yield historically - the average real return for gilts since 1918 is 2.3 per cent. And you can earn that with absolutely no risk to your capital if you hold your gilt to maturity. Income investors have got it pretty good at the moment, all things considered.' How to invest for success \u0095 Register as a non-taxpayer. IFA Promotion estimates that \u00a3300m will be lost this year through unnecessary tax paid on savings accounts. If you are eligible to earn untaxed interest, ask your bank or building society for an R85 form. \u0095 Watch the interest rate paid on your savings accounts. Many lenders offer a high headline rate only to drop it a few months later. \u0095 Keep tabs on the performance of equity and bond investments. Make sure you know if one of your fund managers is changing jobs or has gone off the boil, and ask your independent financial adviser whether you should consider switching funds. \u0095 Maximise use of your annual Isa allowance. You can put up to \u00a33,000 in cash and \u00a33,000 in stocks and shares mini Isas, or up to \u00a37,000 in a maxi Isa each tax year. If you can't afford to invest new money, transfer existing unit trust and cash investments that are not protected from tax. \u0095 Buy your investments through a discount broker or negotiate a commission rebate with your independent financial adviser. The commission rebate can usually be added to the value of your investment, increasing the amount you can earn. \u0095 Use your capital gains tax allowance, particularly if you are a higher-rate taxpayer. If you need to receive a fixed amount of money on a certain date - to pay school fees, for example - consider investing in zero-dividend preference shares, which produce a predetermined capital return on a fixed date. \u0095 Don't put all your money in one investment, even if it's paying a great income. Spread your cash and reduce the risk; it might not give the highest possible income at the outset, but it will protect your earnings in the long run. \u0095 If your spouse is a non-tax payer or pays a lower rate than yourself, consider transferring some of your investments into his or her name. \u0095 Try not to withdraw all returns from your investments in the first few years. The more you let them grow, the more income they will produce for you in the future. \u0095 Consult an independent financial adviser.

Spirent's problems lie in the other parts of its business. Profits from the systems division fell by two-thirds as airline consolidation and rationalisation continued, and the sensing solutions business was hit by a long list of problems. Fortunately, the growth of the communications division means these are an increasingly small part of the business - indeed, Brookes hints they may even be sold. The decline in its shares leaves it valued at 25 times prospective earnings for this year. That is not expensive for such a quality business, although they may not move much until the situation of the US technology industry becomes clearer.",

      "body": "<p>There is a story about De Beers, the diamond cartel now polishing a more friendly image, that needs to be told. </p> <p>Several years ago, the BBC set out to make a hard-hitting documentary on the colourful and controversial history of the 130-year-old diamond cartel. The Diamond Empire was conceived as an update to Edward Jay Epstein's compelling 1982 book The Diamond Invention. </p> <p>De Beers' least favourite book told how the Oppenheimers, white South Africa's richest and most powerful family, crafted an intrinsically worthless piece of crystallised carbon into one of the world's most desirable objects. It told, too, how De Beers dealt with the devil to retain its grip on its precious gem monopoly, even doing secret Cold War deals with communist Russia. </p> <p>In the mid-Nineties, De Beers faced a formidable set of challenges: the collapse of the Soviet Union, whose Siberian mines are key gem suppliers, smuggling from war-torn Africa, an Australian rebellion against the cartel and the opening up of Canada's arctic wastes as a major new, rival producer. </p> <p>Instead of broadcasting a penetrating insight into how De Beers confronted each threat, BBC producers watched aghast as the secretive diamond giant, which hated coming under any microscope, ruthlessly castrated the programme. </p> <p>Through its peerless network of contacts the firm obtained a pre-broadcast copy of the series. Under siege from De Beers' lawyers, the BBC bureaucrats cut and cut and cut. Then, to frustrate the chances of even the pale shadow of a programme being aired outside Britain, De Beers threatened legal action anyway. </p> <p>The then head of De Beers' Central Selling Organisation was Nicky Oppenheimer, son of the 'grand old man' of South African capitalism, Harry Oppenheimer, and grandson of De Beers founder Ernest Oppenheimer. Since then, the empire has changed a lot: the CSO has been rebadged as the more cuddly Diamond Trading Company; Harry died aged 91 last year; and Nicky, the 'diamond dauphin', has finally taken the throne as De Beers chairman. He is now planning to take the diamond firm private in a controversial \u00a312 billion takeover. </p> <p>Nicky is not quite a chip off the old patrician Oppenheimer block. Nicknamed 'the Cuban' for his raggy grey-black beard, he is engagingly self-deprecating. He has a penchant for odd, loud socks and is quite at home beating the tribal drum with De Beers' black workforce. He got the top job, he says, by choosing his parents carefully. Harry is still spoken of with a mixture of awe and respect. His father's lieutenant, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chair of De Beers' sister company, Anglo American, is an aloof, old-school, colonial aristocrat. But Nicky, De Beers' friends and foes all agree, is an all-round nice guy, with easy-going charm and no trace of bully. </p> <p>Anyone who believes, however, that De Beers' friendly new broom has lost the Oppenheimer hard edge should remember the BBC tale. Anyone who thinks, too, that De Beers has softened its control-freak determination to stay on top is sadly misguided. And anyone who believes Nicky is a reluctant heir to his father's mantle misjudges the man. </p> <p>'Traditionally, he has been quite shy and not forthcoming,' one close associate says. 'When he comes to London and the City, he becomes almost inhibited. But he's a changed person when he gets back under that South African sky. Diamonds are his life. Nicky's family is very important to him and De Beers is part and parcel of the family.' </p> <p>Born in Johannesburg in 1945, Nicky lives and breathes the modern diamond market. He was three when his father and a New York advertising agency coined the immortal slogan 'a diamond is forever'. By then De Beers, originally founded by Cecil Rhodes in 1888 and taken over by Ernest Oppenheimer in 1929, had been around for well over half a century. But last year, global sales were at a fraction of their \u00a33.8bn peak, and it was Harry who fashioned the demand to soak up De Beers' growing, strictly monopolised supply. </p> <p>Educated at a private English boarding school, then Harrow and Christ Church college, Oxford, Nicky spent much of the years from eight to 21 away from his beloved South Africa. He joined Anglo in 1968, learning the mining trade in the firm's diamond, gold and uranium divisions. In 1975, he moved over to De Beers, starting with a short stint at the cartel's ultra-secure London headquarters - home to its \u00a32bn diamond stockpile - in Charterhouse Street, opposite the Smithfield meat market. When he returned to London in 1984 it was as De Beers' deputy chairman, second in rank to his austere English uncle, Sir Philip Oppenheimer. </p> <p>Undoubtedly it was the sharp difference in personalities that first prompted talk that Nicky was not the man for the throne. He was more remarked on for his love of cricket and helicopters than for his business acumen. An avid sportsman, he runs his own cricket team in South Africa - his 'grand folly', he calls it. He regularly flies his own helicopter from the roof of Charterhouse Street to Antwerp, the hub of Europe's diamond trade. The pilot's licence is one of modest Nicky's few proud boasts: he is half colour blind and failed the pilot's test when he first took it in his twenties. </p> <p>De Beers and Anglo are undoubtedly more collegiate now than in Harry's day. 'Gary Ralfe [De Beers' managing director] is the man in the wheelhouse, but Nicky is very much the captain on the bridge,' one insider said. </p> <p>Also, since the end of apartheid, Anglo has, under Ogilvie Thompson, become bigger, more international and - following pressure from institutional shareholders - less of a family firm. It has switched its headquarters to London, and snapped up Minorco and Tarmac. </p> <p>Following the current De Beers deal Nicky will step down as Anglo's deputy chairman, raising the prospect that he will be the first Oppenheimer not eventually to chair Anglo as well as De Beers. </p> <p>'Commercial and financial reality are undoubtedly driving the changes,' one De Beers observer said. 'But don't underestimate Nicky's influence. He's very much up there in the driving seat, and smart enough not to swim against the tide.' </p> <p>The De Beers' takeover, though, is pure Oppenheimer. Afterwards, Anglo and Central Holdings, the family firm that manages the Oppenheimer billions, will each own 45 per cent, and Botswana's state diamond company the rest. Management and control, however, rest with the family. Anglo, therefore, is effectively helping the Oppenheimers secure control of their diamond inheritance, while the family barely puts its hand in its pocket. </p> <p>No wonder, then, that several institutions are hopping mad. Nicky may yet need to sweeten the price. </p> <p>'Nicky bears a dynasty on his shoulders,' the De Beers watcher said. 'At Anglo and De Beers, the Oppenheimers have always had cross-shareholdings and control. The trouble is that for Anglo to grow, the cross-holdings must go and the family stake must fall. Diamonds and De Beers are Nicky's priority and this gives him control. But, in this day and age, why should Anglo be giving the Oppenheimer family such a generous helping hand?' </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name </strong> Nicky Oppenheimer </p> <p><strong> Born </strong> 1945 </p> <p><strong> Job </strong> Chairman of De Beers </p> <p><strong> Education </strong> Christ Church college, Oxford </p> <p><strong> Other Directorships </strong> Deputy chairman of Anglo American, chairman of Central Holdings </p> <p><strong> Hobbies </strong> Cricket, squash, golf, flying helicopters</p>",

Analysts valued the holding at \u00a37 billion earlier this year, but it could now be worth much less after the stock market's slump and concerns over telecoms firms' rising debts. </p> <p>The former nationalised industry is being pushed to make disposals to cut its own \u00a330bn debt mountain and it wants to sell its minority stakes in a number of Asian companies. </p> <p>A source familiar with Vodafone's thinking said Cegetel was one of the three 'areas of mutual interest' that the company shared with BT. The others are BT's stakes in Spanish mobile phone company Airtel and Japan Telecom, which Vodafone bought into last week. </p> <p>The source said the mobile phone firm was not involved in talks with BT about any of the three stakes, but things would change 'very quickly', providing the price was right. </p> <p>BT is under fire from institutional investors concerned at what they perceive as the company's lack of strategy. Larger shareholders have called for the resignations of the chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield and chairman, Sir Iain Vallance. Privately, several have said they would support a rights issue to offset BT's debt crisis only if the two men resigned. </p> <p>BT has publicly ruled out the prospect of an imminent rights issue, so it must now find alternative ways of paring down its debt. The company has until April to submit plans to credit rating agencies, or risk having its debt rating downgraded. </p> <p>The company plans to float 25 per cent of BT Wireless, its mobile phone division, later this year, but given the disappointing listing of Orange last month, investors may have lost their appetite for telecom stocks. </p> <p>BT's woes over the flotation of its subsidiary have been compounded by the fact that Deutsche Telekom and KPN Telecom of the Netherlands also plan to list their mobile phone divisions this year. </p> <p>A question mark also hangs over the flotation of Yell, BT's Yellow Pages arm. BT had originally planned to list 25 per cent of it, but a long- running review by the Office of Fair Trading has now prompted the company to explore other options. One possibility being considered by BT's new finance director, Philip Hampton, could be a full demerger of Yell.</p>",

The former nationalised industry is being pushed to make disposals to cut its own \u00a330bn debt mountain and it wants to sell its minority stakes in a number of Asian companies. A source familiar with Vodafone's thinking said Cegetel was one of the three 'areas of mutual interest' that the company shared with BT. The others are BT's stakes in Spanish mobile phone company Airtel and Japan Telecom, which Vodafone bought into last week. The source said the mobile phone firm was not involved in talks with BT about any of the three stakes, but things would change 'very quickly', providing the price was right. BT is under fire from institutional investors concerned at what they perceive as the company's lack of strategy. Larger shareholders have called for the resignations of the chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield and chairman, Sir Iain Vallance. Privately, several have said they would support a rights issue to offset BT's debt crisis only if the two men resigned. BT has publicly ruled out the prospect of an imminent rights issue, so it must now find alternative ways of paring down its debt. The company has until April to submit plans to credit rating agencies, or risk having its debt rating downgraded. The company plans to float 25 per cent of BT Wireless, its mobile phone division, later this year, but given the disappointing listing of Orange last month, investors may have lost their appetite for telecom stocks. BT's woes over the flotation of its subsidiary have been compounded by the fact that Deutsche Telekom and KPN Telecom of the Netherlands also plan to list their mobile phone divisions this year. A question mark also hangs over the flotation of Yell, BT's Yellow Pages arm. BT had originally planned to list 25 per cent of it, but a long- running review by the Office of Fair Trading has now prompted the company to explore other options. One possibility being considered by BT's new finance director, Philip Hampton, could be a full demerger of Yell.",

Just as a reformed alcoholic would have revisited his guilty past seeing The Lost Weekend, I was reminded of this experience by <strong> Chocolat</strong>, a film version of Joanne Harris's winsome novel about a catalytic chocolati\u00e8re in a small town somewhere between Bordeaux and Toulouse in the late Fifties. </p> <p>This is a fable, a fairy tale set 15 years after World War II in a community seemingly untouched by the return of De Gaulle, the birth pangs of the Fifth Republic and the Algerian war. Television is unknown and the only touch of popular culture comes from the newly arrived young cur\u00e9 who sings Presley's 'Hound Dog' as he weeds the churchyard. It's also a very Anglo-Saxon affair - better than 'Allo 'Allo or Toujours Provence , more like Pagnol \u00e0 l'anglais e - performed by a cast of Brits, Americans and Swedes, with just the translucently beautiful Juliette Binoche to provide an authentic Gallic touch. All the dialogue, apart from an occasional bonne journ\u00e9e, is in English, and when the narrator speaks of the town being devoted to tranquillit\u00e9, this is immediately translated as 'tranquillity' for those at the back of the class. </p> <p>Binoche plays Vianne Rocher, the magical chocolati\u00e8re who arrives with her little daughter at the beginning of Lent, and rents a shop to sell magical confectionery based on ancient Mayan recipes. By Easter Sunday she's won over the hearts, minds and stomachs of this repressed, pious Catholic community. Her liberating pagan spirit works through the town's ill-treated women. She separates the lovely Lena Olin from an abusive husband (Peter Stormare), provides a sex-starved wife with chocolate aphrodisiacs for her husband, revives her lusty old crone of a landlady (Judi Dench), and so on. Her chief opponent is the xenophobic Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who is the local seigneur, the mayor and co-author of the priest's sermons. Incapable of confronting the choc of the new, the count declares 'a holy war' on chocolate' and subsequently stirs up a campaign against a party of riverborne travellers led by Johnny Depp (in his traditional outsider role and specifically his gypsy from last year's The Man Who Cried). </p> <p>'It isn't easy being different,' remarks Binoche at one point, but in fact everything comes easy in this movie - love, reconciliation, redemption, re-creation and even death. It's also an easy film to enjoy, like most of Hallstr\u00f6m's neatly turned, bittersweet movies about happy adjustments within disturbed families. But it's not one to think about too much or for long, and much inferior to Babette's Feast, the Danish film. The town, by the way, doesn't have a gendarme or a doctor but, Mon Dieu, it's going to need a dentist. </p> <p>I've restrained myself more or less from the confectionery jokes that have preoccupied American critics. But it occurs to me that there could be a niche TV outlet for this and similar movies - Claire Denis's Chocolat, Chabrol's new picture Merci pour le chocolat, Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory; and perhaps Jane Campion's Sweetie, the movie of Barrie's Quality Street, Mutiny on the Bounty and Mission to Mar . It could be called The Cocoa Channel. </p> <p>Binoche's Vianne is denounced as a witch in Chocolat. But she's a benign witch, as is Cate Blanchett who is similarly accused by murmuring rednecks in Sam Raimi's occult thriller <strong> The Gift</strong>. Blanchett plays Annie Wilson, a smalltown widow in Georgia who supports her three small sons by using her gifts as a clairvoyant. She's also an adviser and counsellor on health and mental problems, worshipped by those she helps but despised by the town's middle classes and officialdom. That is, until the police need her help in tracing a promiscuous girl from the country-club set who's disappeared. </p> <p>Annie's visions direct the cops to the woman's corpse and result in the conviction for murder of a brutal, womanising farmer. So far, not so bad. The movie has a sense of place and a strong cast that includes Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Hilary Swank and that notably eccentric character actor Michael Jeter as a defence attorney. But if someone in a thriller says 'We can get on with our lives now' when there are three minutes to go, we know there's going to be some extra shock. Here, Annie says this with 45 minutes left and four prime suspects walking the streets. Unfortunately for her, Annie's visions are somewhat selective, and unfortunately for the audience, most of us will have nailed the killer long before she does.

      "body": "<p>The productivity gap between Britain and the US has widened dramatically since New Labour came to power, despite numerous Government efforts to close it. </p> <p>New data shows that measures taken by Gordon Brown have so far had no significant impact on Britain's productivity performance, a key determinant of increased living standards and prosperity. Addressing the country's woeful productivity levels has been at the heart of all the Chancellor's four Budgets. </p> <p>Mary O'Mahony, a leading expert at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, who has updated the figures she used for the Treasury's policy paper on productivity, said: 'The gap has widened by nearly a third.' </p> <p>The news comes as Brown makes final preparations for Wednesday's Budget, which will contain further measures to bridge the gap, such as more tax credits. O'Mahony says one average working hour in the US economy in 1999 - the latest year for which figures are available - was nearly 38 per cent more productive than one in the UK. In 1996, just before Labour came to power, the gap was around 28 per cent. </p> <p>The gap with Europe has not improved either, sticking at around 30 per cent. The figures exclude the public, health and education sectors. </p> <p>Although the figures will disappoint Brown, the Treasury believes his measures will start to feed through to the system. Officials liken the UK's situation to that of the US in the mid-Nineties, when performance picked up after economic stability and high employment worked their way through the system. </p> <p>News of the widening gap comes as the main employers' and employees' organisations join forces to find solutions to the problem. Urged on by the Chancellor, the CBI and the TUC will today issue an unprecedented joint call for such measures as extending tax credits for research and development, improvements to regional development funding, reforms to the climate change levy, and public funding for training all adults to GCSE level. </p> <p>Digby Jones, CBI director-general, said: 'It is time to stop talking about the productivity gap and start doing something about it.' </p> <p>TUC General Secretary John Monks added: 'By working in partnership with the CBI and others, we have a golden opportunity to secure a long-lasting improvement in our productivity record.' </p> <p>\u0095 City economists are split on the outcome of this week's Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Many are waiting to see what the Chancellor will do in the budget. </p> <p>Those questioned for a Reuters poll gave a 65 per cent chance of 'no change' in interest rates on Thursday, but a majority believed there would be a cut by May.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The productivity gap between Britain and the US has widened dramatically since New Labour came to power, despite numerous Government efforts to close it. New data shows that measures taken by Gordon Brown have so far had no significant impact on Britain's productivity performance, a key determinant of increased living standards and prosperity. Addressing the country's woeful productivity levels has been at the heart of all the Chancellor's four Budgets. Mary O'Mahony, a leading expert at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, who has updated the figures she used for the Treasury's policy paper on productivity, said: 'The gap has widened by nearly a third.' The news comes as Brown makes final preparations for Wednesday's Budget, which will contain further measures to bridge the gap, such as more tax credits. O'Mahony says one average working hour in the US economy in 1999 - the latest year for which figures are available - was nearly 38 per cent more productive than one in the UK. In 1996, just before Labour came to power, the gap was around 28 per cent. The gap with Europe has not improved either, sticking at around 30 per cent. The figures exclude the public, health and education sectors. Although the figures will disappoint Brown, the Treasury believes his measures will start to feed through to the system. Officials liken the UK's situation to that of the US in the mid-Nineties, when performance picked up after economic stability and high employment worked their way through the system. News of the widening gap comes as the main employers' and employees' organisations join forces to find solutions to the problem. Urged on by the Chancellor, the CBI and the TUC will today issue an unprecedented joint call for such measures as extending tax credits for research and development, improvements to regional development funding, reforms to the climate change levy, and public funding for training all adults to GCSE level. Digby Jones, CBI director-general, said: 'It is time to stop talking about the productivity gap and start doing something about it.' TUC General Secretary John Monks added: 'By working in partnership with the CBI and others, we have a golden opportunity to secure a long-lasting improvement in our productivity record.' \u0095 City economists are split on the outcome of this week's Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Many are waiting to see what the Chancellor will do in the budget. Those questioned for a Reuters poll gave a 65 per cent chance of 'no change' in interest rates on Thursday, but a majority believed there would be a cut by May.",

While you can find Donald Bradman's cricket bat and the van that ferried Australia's first mobile television film unit around the outback, the museum is anything but a mindless celebration of the lucky country. </p> <p>It does not shrink from addressing the history of its treatment of the Aboriginals. There is graphic material on the massacres carried out by whites well into the nineteenth century. You can see the pistols and metal clubs that colonists used to murder women and children when Tasmania's first Australians were exterminated. </p> <p>But nothing on display is more controversial than the architecture itself. The architects, Melbourne-based Ashton Raggatt McDougall, have deliberately chosen to house those sections devoted to the Aborigines in a replica of Daniel Libeskind's celebrated museum of Jewish history in Berlin. The scale is slightly reduced and the materials are different. Walls are made from black concrete, puckered to look like rubber, rather than the zinc sheet Libeskind used. But the plan is an exact copy of the lightning-flash zigzag that Libeskind created by breaking a five-pointed star of David, except that Howard Raggatt prefers to call it a quotation rather than a copy. Libeskind is angry. </p> <p>'It's shocking, banal and plagiarism,' he told Sydney journalist Anne Suskind. But for Raggatt, it is a legitimate strategy, put to work to make a comparison between the plight of the Aboriginals and the horror of the Holocaust. It is a comparison that has made Ashton Raggatt and McDougall almost as unpopular with some of the more conservative members of the Australian government as they are with Libeskind. After all, John Howard is the Prime Minister who has refused to apologise on behalf of white Australia to the Aboriginals for their maltreatment. </p> <p>But determined to avoid a public row that would overshadow the opening of the museum, the government is standing back. 'Its just an argument among architects,' says an official spokesman. But privately, Ministers are unhappy about the association, especially since it was never made explicit in the submission that Ashton Raggatt and McDougall made to the architectural competition which they won to secure the project. </p> <p>The \u00a350 million museum certainly manages to press a lot of buttons in a way that suggests a rare ability to make architecture matter. It's not how the building looks that counts for once, but what it is saying. With a remarkable site in the heart of Canberra, overlooking Lake Burley Griffin, and aligned directly on the giant flag pole that crowns Parliament House, the museum is richly inventive and genuinely serious. It forms a long ribbon, strung out along the waterfront and turning back on itself in a wide arc to create at its heart a sheltered garden of Australian dreams. </p> <p>It's filled with a fragmented map of Australia pockmarked with the names of massacre sites and battlegrounds. The building is a series of fragments, seamlessly and surreally joined one with another with the smoothness of a computer simulacrum. It's not just Libeskind's Jewish museum that provides the source material. There are so many quotations that you sometimes feel that Australia has built a national museum of architecture rather than one dedicated to its own social history. On one part of the site is a reworking of Le Corbusier's Villa Savoie, but the smooth, white skin of the original has turned fuzzy black and it crashes into a vivid-red, flattened, cut-out of the fa\u00e7ade of the Australian parliament, used to provide a suitably important looking home for the institute for Aboriginal studies. It looks across a sweep of grass toward the Australian version of the Berlin building that, in turn, morphs into a central entrance hall in which Raggatt has painstakingly recreated fragments of the brown glass and the window mullions used in the Sydney Opera House. Along the way, there is a little souvenir of James Stirling's Stuttgart Staatsgallerie and an Aldo Rossi building. </p> <p>It could be a would-be high-culture version of Las Vegas, and the themed architecture typified by the casinos, but it isn't. Raggatt has created a building that is more than a collage of postcards. It is a building that amounts to a book, even if it is written in a language that most people will have trouble reading. Ashton Raggatt and McDougall don't content themselves with using buildings as words - they have also covered their building with words, to provide another, all but incomprehensible layer of meaning. The aluminium skin is pitted with regular patterns of dimples, giant Braille characters used as a form of decoration. It's a language that very few sighted people can make sense of, and which is out of reach of the fingers of those blind visitors who might be able to read it. Raggatt, however, is happy to translate as he leads you around. 'Who are my neighbours?' he asks, pointing at one strip of aluminium on the sculpted skin. 'She'll be right, mate,' he interprets, pointing to another. </p> <p>It doesn't stop there. The colours tell their own story. Fragments of the exterior are painted black and red to reflect the Aboriginal flag. Another slice is buff and blue, the colours of the uniforms worn by the convicts in the early penal colonies. And if that wasn't enough, the architects have wrapped the entire thing in yet another metaphorical layer, one that is enough to make your head spin. It seems the conceptual starting point of the museum was to turn the grids that define Canberra into threads, and then knot them to make a building defined by the form created by the knot, suggesting the shared destinies of all Australia's peoples. </p> <p>Getting to grips with this museum on its architect's terms isn't easy, even if it is possible to experience it simply as a physical sensation devoid of the intellectual content. But it doesn't matter if you don't get it all first time around. There is no Rosetta Stone provided by the architect to unravel all the meanings, just a few broad and not so broad hints. It is an architecture of intelligence and anger, of imagination and obsession, with an ambition not just to redefine Australia's sense of itself, but architecture too.</p>",

But privately, Ministers are unhappy about the association, especially since it was never made explicit in the submission that Ashton Raggatt and McDougall made to the architectural competition which they won to secure the project. The \u00a350 million museum certainly manages to press a lot of buttons in a way that suggests a rare ability to make architecture matter. It's not how the building looks that counts for once, but what it is saying. With a remarkable site in the heart of Canberra, overlooking Lake Burley Griffin, and aligned directly on the giant flag pole that crowns Parliament House, the museum is richly inventive and genuinely serious. It forms a long ribbon, strung out along the waterfront and turning back on itself in a wide arc to create at its heart a sheltered garden of Australian dreams. It's filled with a fragmented map of Australia pockmarked with the names of massacre sites and battlegrounds. The building is a series of fragments, seamlessly and surreally joined one with another with the smoothness of a computer simulacrum. It's not just Libeskind's Jewish museum that provides the source material. There are so many quotations that you sometimes feel that Australia has built a national museum of architecture rather than one dedicated to its own social history. On one part of the site is a reworking of Le Corbusier's Villa Savoie, but the smooth, white skin of the original has turned fuzzy black and it crashes into a vivid-red, flattened, cut-out of the fa\u00e7ade of the Australian parliament, used to provide a suitably important looking home for the institute for Aboriginal studies. It looks across a sweep of grass toward the Australian version of the Berlin building that, in turn, morphs into a central entrance hall in which Raggatt has painstakingly recreated fragments of the brown glass and the window mullions used in the Sydney Opera House. Along the way, there is a little souvenir of James Stirling's Stuttgart Staatsgallerie and an Aldo Rossi building. It could be a would-be high-culture version of Las Vegas, and the themed architecture typified by the casinos, but it isn't. Raggatt has created a building that is more than a collage of postcards. It is a building that amounts to a book, even if it is written in a language that most people will have trouble reading. Ashton Raggatt and McDougall don't content themselves with using buildings as words - they have also covered their building with words, to provide another, all but incomprehensible layer of meaning. The aluminium skin is pitted with regular patterns of dimples, giant Braille characters used as a form of decoration. It's a language that very few sighted people can make sense of, and which is out of reach of the fingers of those blind visitors who might be able to read it. Raggatt, however, is happy to translate as he leads you around. 'Who are my neighbours?' he asks, pointing at one strip of aluminium on the sculpted skin. 'She'll be right, mate,' he interprets, pointing to another. It doesn't stop there. The colours tell their own story. Fragments of the exterior are painted black and red to reflect the Aboriginal flag. Another slice is buff and blue, the colours of the uniforms worn by the convicts in the early penal colonies. And if that wasn't enough, the architects have wrapped the entire thing in yet another metaphorical layer, one that is enough to make your head spin. It seems the conceptual starting point of the museum was to turn the grids that define Canberra into threads, and then knot them to make a building defined by the form created by the knot, suggesting the shared destinies of all Australia's peoples. Getting to grips with this museum on its architect's terms isn't easy, even if it is possible to experience it simply as a physical sensation devoid of the intellectual content. But it doesn't matter if you don't get it all first time around. There is no Rosetta Stone provided by the architect to unravel all the meanings, just a few broad and not so broad hints. It is an architecture of intelligence and anger, of imagination and obsession, with an ambition not just to redefine Australia's sense of itself, but architecture too.",

But this is as nothing beside the devotion they command in Dublin, where they have a bigger following than the Pope. </p> <p>The Olympia Theatre was crammed to its ornate upper circle with over-revving fans, chanting for Huey like football supporters, as the Criminals sauntered on stage for the first gig of three in the city. If admirers of the first two albums had entertained a few doubts about the super-smooth late-night lounge flavour of the last one, Mimosa, then the new release, Loco, will have everyone reassured; the Criminals have returned to the energetic hybrid hip-hop/rock/soul sounds and often jokey lyrics that marked the early material, while keeping the slick Seventies jazz-funk influence prominent in songs such as 'Half A Block' and 'She's My Friend'. </p> <p>But it's the swaggering, playful side that marks the Criminals' stage shows, together with their uncanny ability to produce a much bigger live sound than you'd expect from a three-piece band - an effect achieved largely through volume and liberal use of distortion pedals on Huey's Les Paul, but helped along by Fast's knack of swapping neatly between keyboard, bass and flugelhorn, or even playing them all at once.

      "bodyText": "Fun Lovin' Criminals Olympia, Dublin Brows are frequently furrowed in the music world over the mystery of the Fun Lovin' Criminals' status in Britain and comparative lack of it back in old New York. But this is as nothing beside the devotion they command in Dublin, where they have a bigger following than the Pope. The Olympia Theatre was crammed to its ornate upper circle with over-revving fans, chanting for Huey like football supporters, as the Criminals sauntered on stage for the first gig of three in the city. If admirers of the first two albums had entertained a few doubts about the super-smooth late-night lounge flavour of the last one, Mimosa, then the new release, Loco, will have everyone reassured; the Criminals have returned to the energetic hybrid hip-hop/rock/soul sounds and often jokey lyrics that marked the early material, while keeping the slick Seventies jazz-funk influence prominent in songs such as 'Half A Block' and 'She's My Friend'. But it's the swaggering, playful side that marks the Criminals' stage shows, together with their uncanny ability to produce a much bigger live sound than you'd expect from a three-piece band - an effect achieved largely through volume and liberal use of distortion pedals on Huey's Les Paul, but helped along by Fast's knack of swapping neatly between keyboard, bass and flugelhorn, or even playing them all at once. Huey occasionally managed to play two guitars at the same time, most notably a slide solo in the Leonard Cohenesque 'My Little Song', when his free hand wasn't busy with what we'll generously identify as a roll-up cigarette. The Criminals launched the set at a furious pace with the magnificently titled hillbilly parody 'Dickholder' from the new album, and immediately you could see that you were in the presence of serious devotion: the album was only released last week and the entire audience knew all the words.

Mackie entered the stage with the most panache, in a white Tom Wolfe suit and panama, but it was Huey who bantered with the audience, playing up his Noo Yark mobster charm and even raising a cheer with the creaking old joke about the racehorses and the talking dog - though this paled beside his re-creation of the duel between Darth Vader and Obi Wan Kenobi as enacted by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino (with real light sabres).

It ought to be a figment, this folly by the sea, but <strong>Tacita Dean</strong> has discovered and filmed it. </p> <p>Her camera takes you through the space-age doors and deep into its deserted chambers. Water drips from the gaping roof. Lagoons collect on the floor. Light seeps through narrow windscreens. Just as you are wondering what befell the owners, the camera swivels out towards the sea. In less than a minute, a distant storm races the waves to the shore, lashing against this wreck of a long-lost future. </p> <p>Time and tide wait for no man, especially when he's in prison, like the owner of this futuristic fantasy on Cayman Brac. Does the convict dream of it in his cell, this desolate house by the shore? Does he wonder what happens when he isn't there? </p> <p>The owner gradually becomes an absent presence in Dean's film, as she shows you what he can only imagine. By the time her camera has moved slowly through its seven-minute scope, the scene is fixed in your imagination. The house, waiting forever by a turquoise tide, has become a place in the mind. This sense of expectation, of isolation and imminent nostalgia, belongs to the art of Edward Hopper, to whom Dean, at 35, has already been compared. Like him, she originally trained as a painter. At Tate Britain, you can see her early images of ships billowing in the night like ghosts, drawn in ephemeral chalk on blackboard. She also has Hopper's fascination with lighthouses, lone eyes searching the wilderness for life. But Dean doesn't have the painter's genius for condensing cinema into singular pictures. She works by spooling time through semi-static images. </p> <p> Sound Mirrors opens with a still shot of a coastline at evening. A Martello tower looms like a monolith in the silvery twilight. Before it lies a dark and motionless inlet. Framed by bulrushes, the whole landscape looks as though it's been worked in shadowy monochrome. And then a breath of wind shivers the painted waters. </p> <p>On cue, the film drifts to the 'sound mirrors' - concrete dishes used by the army as a primitive early-warning system in the 1920s. In the dying light, these bizarre prototypes rise up like massive heads before fading into a darkness pierced only by the beam of a lighthouse. Dean's 16mm film picks up the flutter of late birds and the continuing buzz of the tiny plane that took off in the first image. War still hovers, anticipated on this strand of English coast, even though the defences - lighthouse, dishes, tower - now look as archaic as Easter Island statues. </p> <p>This is a marvellous piece, moving through the ever-present past at exactly the mind's pace. Everything marks time, from the trailing biplane to the film stock, with its antique tones, ticking through the aged cine-projector stationed at the centre of the room. These contraptions are more than a technical necessity. They add a further soundtrack, with their murmuring narrative, and they often echo, in their motion, the very images projected. </p> <p>So the waves in Delft Hydraulics , an experiment in confined turbulence, ribbon through their glass tank as ceaselessly as the spooling film. In Disappearance at Sea, the lighthouse lamp revolves between black clouds and sunset in slow accord with the reels of the projector. The film ends when the sky - and thus the celluloid - fades to blackness. These circular connections run right through Dean's show. The sun rises in Berwick and sets in Berlin. The tiny plane lifts above Kent and descends on Cayman. Walk among these rooms, radiating from a central jukebox that plays ambient sounds from around the world on a 24-hour clock, and you are always aware that the same tide eventually washes up on each shore. </p> <p>Dean's fascination with coastal relics isn't always fully enacted in her films. Not far from the Bubble House, for example, lies the wreckage of a trimaran. Again, Dean's camera witnesses its bleached and sea-worn shell, watching the brine drip through its ruined structure. But the boat itself is not a haunting spectacle. You need to know what the film cannot evoke, namely, that this is the Teignmouth Electron, in which Donald Crowhurst tried to sail the world singlehanded in 1969, faking his log book and eventually throwing himself overboard when the pressure of maintaining his deception became overwhelming. </p> <p>Dean's films thrive best when they aren't underpinned by prior knowledge and their wonders are allowed to unfold at the slow pace of her camera. Two recent films in this show fully merit their respective lengths - one takes 44 minutes; the other lasts for more than an hour. </p> <p> Fernsehturm is set in a revolving restaurant at the top of a tower. It begins as the waitresses set the tables and ends as they clear away the remains of the day. Guests arrive, take their seats, watch the panorama through the windows. The day slips through its seasons, from blue morning to golden evening, crimson sunset to night. As the lights come up across the city, the scene turns inward; smoke drifts beneath the lamps, people bend to twinkling glasses, an organist plays 'The Blue Danube' to the diners of Berlin. The editing is syncopated to twin diurnal rhythms - the decline of the day and the progression of dinner. The restaurant is a clock to both, but the film has its own time, a series of short scenes in which people come and go, food is cooked and eaten, conversation rises and fades away. Each scene is a miniature version of the film in its entirety, just as the film describes a whole day in less than an hour. </p> <p>This is, of course, what naturally happens during the passage of a solar eclipse. Dean's film of this event is surely her masterpiece, an exquisitely subtle portrait of time. The art is all in the patient selection and editing of images: cows lying silent in darkening pastures, ships fading on the horizon, cocks crowing in the afternoon as if it were sunrise. Blackness finally fills the screen like an abstract painting. When the sunlight returns, seen through a canopy of leaves, it ripples through the static image, bringing the trees - and the picture - back to life.</p>",

      "body": "<b> Horst Portraits: 60 Years of Style</b> National Portrait Gallery, London WC2 until 3 June <p> Horst's photo of Jean Cocteau in Venice brings to mind James Joyce's advice on portraiture. 'Never mind my soul,' he told the painter Patrick Nuohy in 1924. 'Just be sure you have my tie right.' It doesn't matter that by 1947 Cocteau was a grand old enfant terrible of French letters. What matters is that Horst got his tie right. And he also got the lapels of his jacket, the collar of his shirt and the texture - a well-washed linen - of his face. </p> <p>This is the advantage of the photographic over the painted portrait. If nothing else you're going to get the tie right. And since getting the tie right is relatively easy, maybe that means you have plenty of energy left for the soul-searching. </p> <p>Or maybe there's more to getting the tie right than one might think. Maybe the soul is in the tie. Or perhaps - and this is the big one - there is only the tie. But that's a wild exaggeration of course: there's also the dress. </p> <p>Horst photographed ties, dresses and their occupants for 60 years. He was born into a wealthy family in Germany in 1906. At 23 he moved to Paris where he met George Hoyningen-Huene, chief photographer for French Vogue. Horst became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and assistant and began taking his own photographs for French, British and - after an initially unsuccessful engagement - American Vogue. </p> <p>The roles of fashion photographer and society portraitist went hand in hand, especially once models started to emerge as proto-celebrities in their own right. Some of his most famous portraits are of models like Lisa Fonssagrives (swooning, Marat-like in a radiant bath of light) only in a nominal sense. They're about the creation of glamour. Their real subject - certainly the main source of their fascination now - is the camera's capacity to transform certain people into the photographer's ideal conception of themselves. The fact that Horst's style of baroque romanticism accentuated the paraphernalia involved - elaborate sets and lighting - did nothing to diminish its almost alchemical allure: the tools of glamour were also its ornaments. </p> <p>Horst's pictures drip money. Even the light is extravagant. The catalogue accompanying an exhibition of his portraits at the National Portrait Gallery speaks of the 'timeless elegance' of his work, but this version of timelessness has specific temporal roots. Horst's classic pictures from the 1930s were being made at the same time as Walker Evans's documentary images of the great Depression. The contrast, however, is not as extreme as one might think. Evans's attitude to his subjects was as aesthetic as it was moral. A colleague was struck by the way Evans 'kept his white gloves on' while photographing the slums of Alabama. </p> <p>Horst kept his gloves on too in the sense that there is no sex in his pictures. There's not any desire. It's been frozen - like hair fixed by mousse - by glamour. This makes the photos not less but more interesting. </p> <p>Many of the theatrical tableaux, especially if they're in colour, are nothing short of ghastly. His 1964 photograph of The Duke and Duchess of Windsor is a royal premonition of Diane Arbus's fascination with the grotesque: they're like figures in a wax museum. </p> <p>Horst developed close working relationships with his female models but one rarely feels they might actually live in the clothes they are displaying. Some of his more elaborate shots are like those booths where you put your head through a hole and appear, on film, as an eminent Victorian or - as in his 1935 shot of Martinez de Hoz - a pierrot. Horst exploits this in a picture of Olivia de Havilland in which she leans through a picture frame or mirror. The frame is there in the exhibition so that we too can inhabit Horst's world-view. It also means - quite literally - that we see through the Horst glamour-frame. This alerts us to a tackiness that, once it is no longer held in check by lush monochrome, tends cheeseward, in the direction of drag queens, glam rock and Duran Duran (photographed by Horst in 1986!). </p> <p>More broadly, the embalming legacy of glamour made a reaction against it in the form of radical feminism almost inevitable. Seen in this light his weird colour image of the Duchess of Windsor in 1947 is like one of Cindy Sherman's reworkings of the art historical past. Conversely, the images which now seem most 'timeless' are the less contrived, more natural ones, of Eliette von Karajan in the countryside, for example. </p> <p>A caption for the neighbouring photo recalls that when her husband Herbert got in a taxi at Salzburg the driver asked, 'Where to?' 'It doesn't matter,' replied the maestro. 'I've got business everywhere.' Horst's portrait of Karajan is consistent with this in that he is apparently speeding along in a sports car with his eyes shut. </p> <p>A photo of Maria Callas suggests the diva was permanently in character, playing Aida even in the privacy of her own apartment. Horst recalls he 'was lucky to get out of there alive'. A 1947 image of Rita Hayworth is justly iconic but she looks, also, as if she is watching telly, possibly a re-run of Only Angels Have Wings. </p> <p>Horst spent his career photographing the rich and famous, but one wonders what pictures he would have made had he turned his lens on the less perfectly manicured. We get a hint of this in his picture of the ageing W.H. Auden. Marooned in a sweater almost as baggy as his face, Auden is the only person in the book who doesn't care what he looks like. This is not surprising. As he wrote in 'I am not a Camera', 'Lovers, approaching to kiss,/instinctively shut their eyes before their faces/can be reduced to/anatomical data.' Horst wouldn't have wanted to get that close, but Auden's eyes are shut all the same. Not that it matters: Horst got the sweater anyway.</p>",

At 23 he moved to Paris where he met George Hoyningen-Huene, chief photographer for French Vogue. Horst became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and assistant and began taking his own photographs for French, British and - after an initially unsuccessful engagement - American Vogue. The roles of fashion photographer and society portraitist went hand in hand, especially once models started to emerge as proto-celebrities in their own right. Some of his most famous portraits are of models like Lisa Fonssagrives (swooning, Marat-like in a radiant bath of light) only in a nominal sense. They're about the creation of glamour. Their real subject - certainly the main source of their fascination now - is the camera's capacity to transform certain people into the photographer's ideal conception of themselves. The fact that Horst's style of baroque romanticism accentuated the paraphernalia involved - elaborate sets and lighting - did nothing to diminish its almost alchemical allure: the tools of glamour were also its ornaments. Horst's pictures drip money. Even the light is extravagant. The catalogue accompanying an exhibition of his portraits at the National Portrait Gallery speaks of the 'timeless elegance' of his work, but this version of timelessness has specific temporal roots. Horst's classic pictures from the 1930s were being made at the same time as Walker Evans's documentary images of the great Depression. The contrast, however, is not as extreme as one might think. Evans's attitude to his subjects was as aesthetic as it was moral. A colleague was struck by the way Evans 'kept his white gloves on' while photographing the slums of Alabama. Horst kept his gloves on too in the sense that there is no sex in his pictures. There's not any desire. It's been frozen - like hair fixed by mousse - by glamour. This makes the photos not less but more interesting. Many of the theatrical tableaux, especially if they're in colour, are nothing short of ghastly. His 1964 photograph of The Duke and Duchess of Windsor is a royal premonition of Diane Arbus's fascination with the grotesque: they're like figures in a wax museum. Horst developed close working relationships with his female models but one rarely feels they might actually live in the clothes they are displaying. Some of his more elaborate shots are like those booths where you put your head through a hole and appear, on film, as an eminent Victorian or - as in his 1935 shot of Martinez de Hoz - a pierrot. Horst exploits this in a picture of Olivia de Havilland in which she leans through a picture frame or mirror. The frame is there in the exhibition so that we too can inhabit Horst's world-view. It also means - quite literally - that we see through the Horst glamour-frame. This alerts us to a tackiness that, once it is no longer held in check by lush monochrome, tends cheeseward, in the direction of drag queens, glam rock and Duran Duran (photographed by Horst in 1986!). More broadly, the embalming legacy of glamour made a reaction against it in the form of radical feminism almost inevitable. Seen in this light his weird colour image of the Duchess of Windsor in 1947 is like one of Cindy Sherman's reworkings of the art historical past. Conversely, the images which now seem most 'timeless' are the less contrived, more natural ones, of Eliette von Karajan in the countryside, for example. A caption for the neighbouring photo recalls that when her husband Herbert got in a taxi at Salzburg the driver asked, 'Where to?' 'It doesn't matter,' replied the maestro. 'I've got business everywhere.' Horst's portrait of Karajan is consistent with this in that he is apparently speeding along in a sports car with his eyes shut. A photo of Maria Callas suggests the diva was permanently in character, playing Aida even in the privacy of her own apartment. Horst recalls he 'was lucky to get out of there alive'. A 1947 image of Rita Hayworth is justly iconic but she looks, also, as if she is watching telly, possibly a re-run of Only Angels Have Wings. Horst spent his career photographing the rich and famous, but one wonders what pictures he would have made had he turned his lens on the less perfectly manicured. We get a hint of this in his picture of the ageing W.H. Auden. Marooned in a sweater almost as baggy as his face, Auden is the only person in the book who doesn't care what he looks like. This is not surprising. As he wrote in 'I am not a Camera', 'Lovers, approaching to kiss,/instinctively shut their eyes before their faces/can be reduced to/anatomical data.' Horst wouldn't have wanted to get that close, but Auden's eyes are shut all the same. Not that it matters: Horst got the sweater anyway.",

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of my late-night transatlantic phone conversation with singer-songwriter Will Oldham, which has already veered off on various surreal tangents, courtesy of a thought process that redefines the term lateral, I hear a loud snap followed by a yelp. It transpires that Oldham has absent-mindedly picked up 'a live mouse trap' and 'damn near snapped my finger'. </p> <p>Unperturbed, he picks up the threads of a sentence that began five minutes and several conceptual leaps earlier. In it, he has ranged from the contemplation of infidelity as 'a positive, enhancing experience' to the method acting that underpinned the recorded duets of Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn, the king and queen of the cheating ballad genre which the singer has reinvented to powerful effect on his new album, Ease Down the Road. </p> <p>Talking to Oldham is not unlike listening to one of his songs: you head off on a seemingly traditional narrative, only to find yourself on a hairpin bend that takes you into strange and often disturbing territory which, in turn, gives way to even more surreal terrain. Which may be why the thirtysomething Kentuckian has, for the last 10 years or so, been the most singular songwriter to emerge out of the fragmented alternative American music scene. He is now in a league of one, his singularity of vision matched by a growing and obsessive global fan base that makes every release, every performance, an event of devotion and intensity. </p> <p>A few years back, having recorded a series of effortlessly ramshackle and intermittently inspired albums under various guises - Palace, Palace Music, Palace Songs and Palace Brothers - he conferred on himself the title Bonnie Prince Billy - 'it's kind of regal and it has Billy the Kid connotations' - and released I See A Darkness, one of the most extraordinary, and overlooked, albums of recent years. (The title song, a tender ode to male friendship, has just been recorded by Johnny Cash, the most public acknowledgment yet of Oldham's songwriting skill.) </p> <p>With the name change came a sea change in his music, a movement from the wilfully broken aesthetic of old to a more serene, crafted though still surprising sound. 'Basically, I created Billy and I let him take care of the work, the performing. I mean, it's a thin distinction between me and him, but it's enough to be liberating. Basically, Will talks to his girlfriend, Bill sings to his audience. It's a personal/creative separation born out of the illumination that it's not me, Will Oldham, who gets up on the stage and sings. Music is, or should be, transformative so I kind of took that to its logical conclusion and transformed myself too.' </p> <p>This has yielded surprising results: you could not imagine, for instance, the old Oldham recording a song like the sublime 'After I Made Love To You', possibly the most intimate and guilt- free celebration of illicit sex since Marvin Gaye's 'Let's Get It On'. The whole album drips unbridled sensuality, with the notion that sin - one of Oldham's recurring obsessions - is synonymous not just with damnation - another of his abiding themes - but with transcendence. There are songs here about lust, infidelity, oral sex and, on the closing 'Rich Wife Full Of Happiness', a dream union of man, woman, shark and dog, that ends with the couplet: 'I lick you dry until you're laughing/My fingers in your behind'. (Oldham songs are not for the faint-hearted.) </p> <p>'That song is a kind of Jungian free association all about the mythological, symbolic connotation of fucking,' he explains, haltingly, his voice high and almost breathless. 'But it's a very carnal record which is unsurprising, I suppose, given that sex is something I've always been motivated by, and maybe obsessed with, but not in a perverse way.' He pauses, a conceptual hairpin bend approaching. 'I think sex is something that's too absent from songs and too present in movies. Except in Russ Meyer's movies where it's kind of intense and real as well as utterly cartoonish and unreal. I think he gets pretty close to the real revelatory experience, and that's sort of what I was trying to do. It's a tightrope walk though.' </p> <p>Will is into his stride now: 'I found myself in a familiar space writing this record, then it dawned on me I was entering Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty territory - sin, betrayal, lust. Then again, I'm writing about an actual incident from the point of view of an active participant. I don't think Loretta's songs had much to do with her real life. She doesn't strike me as that sort of girl.' </p> <p>Nor could you countenance Loretta and Conway wrapping their gilded tonsils around a song called 'You Have Cum On Your Hair And Your Dick Is Hanging Out', which surfaced on 1996's Palace Music album Arise Therefore. </p> <p>Though he might appear at times to be a backwoods boy with an almost primal aesthetic that harks back to the roots of the American folk and country traditions, Oldham is also a post-modern chameleon, creating and disregarding personae at will, hiding behind his own carefully created and maintained cult status. He stumbled into music after a fitful career as an actor, having studied drama in his home town of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1987 he landed the lead role in John Sayles's film Matewan, a sprawling epic about America's beleaguered coal-mining communities, in which he played a born-again child preacher whose old testament sermonising prefigured the later intensity of his best songs. </p> <p>By the early Nineties, having grown 'tired of speaking other people's words', he fled the film industry, though he appeared fleetingly, as a dancing nurse in a mental asylum, in his friend Harmony Korine's Julien Donkey-Boy, and is rumoured to have a bigger part in Korine's next, as yet untitled, film. There followed an uncertain period when Oldham roamed America, pitching up in Cape Cod where he suffered a breakdown, tentatively referred to in an old interview as 'fantastic internal trouble'. </p> <p>Out of this crisis came a series of elliptical, self-questioning songs like 'I Am A Cinematographer', on which he sang: 'I walked away from everything that's good/And I walked away from everything I leaned on/Only to find it's made of wood.' </p> <p>Oldham's reticence about his personal life is legendary and is matched with an aversion to the relentless self-promotion that attends the making of music these days. In an age when rock musicians, with a few notable exceptions, have surrendered whatever integrity and dignity their tarnished form still possesses for the the trappings of showbusiness style self-aggrandisement, Oldham has ploughed a straight and dedicated path at odds with the prevailing mood of the times. </p> <p>Through constant name changes, wilful invisibility, and a dedication to letting his music enter the imagination unhindered by the distractions that even minor celebrity brings, he has created a body of work that is unique in both its preoccupations and its methodology. Earlier albums like Viva Lost Blues and Joya were recorded on impossibly low budgets in a matter of days; he speaks without irony of the luxury of having five weeks in the studio to make the new record. </p> <p>Like his friend and mentor, the young guerrilla film maker Harmony Korine - who contributes backing vocals and 'shouting' on the new album - Oldham has become, through his reticence and elusiveness as well as his single-mindedness, a major cult figure. </p> <p>'I guess that's OK,' he says after a long pause, 'because the way I have chosen to work seems to have engendered a strong, discerning audience for the songs. People enter the songs and kind of know what to expect now. They know each song is a journey and that when I'm writing it I'm not even sure where it's going. That's the magic.' </p> <p>I ask if he sabotages a song if it threatens to becomes too traditional, either in structure or subject matter; if disruption, in fact, is an abiding aesthetic? 'I don't think of it as sabotage,' he replies, perhaps offended, 'I think of it as rescue. I don't like to start a song already there. I mean, what's the point of that? I like to get there during the song, and that often means shouting to the musicians and myself, \"Turn here! Turn here!\" or \"Reverse!\" Then, if it works out, everybody goes, \"Wow, look at the view from here!\" </p> <p>'That's the thing you see - the view's nearly always better when you don't really know where the road is leading.' </p> <p> The new Bonnie Prince Billy album, Ease Down the Road, is released on Domino Records on 12 March.

      "body": "<p>It is curious that people who are paid lots of money to be efficient and dynamic at work can be completely incompetent at home. They have To Do lists that never get done. They pride themselves on their organisational skills, but can't get round to fixing the leaking tap in the downstairs loo or remember their mother-in-law's birthday. These people need a personal butler. </p> <p>And now they can have one. At least three companies have recently set up in the UK providing what they like to call 'lifestyle managers' to those for whom home is where the paperwork is. For something over \u00a31,000 a year, the rich, successful but domestically challenged young executive (most clients are in their late twenties and early thirties and many are in the City and new technology businesses) can acquire a PA for the home. These lifestyle managers are charged with ensuring that the harassed exec never again has to sit on the end of a phone listening to plinky-plinky music while waiting to be connected to the gas company. </p> <p>The butlers, uniformly bright and breezy, handle between 15 and 20 clients each, many of whom speak to, or email, them every day. For most of us the thought of investigating the best washing machine for our budget, purchasing it, arranging delivery and waiting in for it to arrive (or not), is likely to induce feelings of deep depression. But give this task to a lifestyle manager and they will react as if you had just offered them an exciting holiday. </p> <p>With the same professionally enthused and upbeat demeanour, they will organise builders, check out the cheapest place to buy a mobile phone, get you pushed up the waiting list for the latest Porsche and send flowers to your best friend. Their clients, or 'members', pay for services as and when they receive them, over and above their joining fee. The companies take a cut from the suppliers, 'but we guarantee that as a member, you don't pay more', says James Hickman of Liberate365 (membership: \u00a31,200 per year) which was set up in November 1999 and now has 24 staff serving 200 individuals. </p> <p>It is certainly true that if Liberate were to book a villa, the company could get a travel agent's discount that wouldn't be available to an individual. There are also economies of scale as the companies put business the way of their favoured suppliers. But Sarah Ewing, a 25 year-old journalist and client of Ten (Time Energy Network) UK - \u00a31,175 a year - the longest-established and largest of the companies in this country, accepts that 'services are sometimes slightly more expensive'. </p> <p>'I asked Mark, my account manager, to get me a cleaner. My boyfriend, who lives in the East London suburbs, pays \u00a34 an hour. I live more centrally and pay \u00a36 an hour, but the cleaning is impeccable, so it's still value for money,' she says. </p> <p>James Hickman suggests that Liberate can even pass on discounts. 'We import cars from abroad for our members, who get a better deal without hassle. And we guarantee the quality of work carried out by our suppliers: we check their books, their references, their quality and value for money, their courtesy. We keep on checking. And despite our stringent requirements, suppliers are now coming to us.' </p> <p>This is beguiling sales talk: a plumber who turns up on time, does the job properly and doesn't rip you off? Too, too marvellous. </p> <p>Alex Cheatle, one of two half-brothers who set up TenUK in 1998, acknowledges that his company has had its work cut out 're-educating the service sector' and admits that 'there is no such thing as the platonic plumber'. The difference, he says, is that TenUK will sort out any problems. </p> <p>Cheatle, a former brand manager for Oil of Ulay, had the idea for TenUK when he was in Peru having a six-month sabbatical 'with a laptop and a rucksack' (personal trainers for your lifestyle tend to be good at stories). He claims not to have known of the US versions - which were a couple of years ahead, and call themselves concierge companies. They are in any case, more like website versions of the Yellow Pages: 'They have all gone down the mass market, technological route, acquiring tens of thousands of members very quickly.' (TenUK also now has a cheaper, website-based service, which is mainly used as a corporate perk). </p> <p>The full butler service costs \u00a31,000, and has 1,000 members assigned to 50 account managers, who range from ex-midwives to former managers at Starbucks. These 'bright young professionals, with whom members can have a peer relationship' are united by their determination to find you the right person to put together your flatpack furniture when you're too lazy or incompetent to do it yourself, and are just longing to wangle you into the perfect country house hotel for a last-minute dirty weekend. And if you want the best tantric sex teacher in London, they can put you in touch immediately, because they've had that one before. </p> <p>William Tyler, 29, runs a company that mounts exhibition displays, and is a client of Entrust, which was set up by five former posh hoteliers (the Savoy, Claridge's, the Mandarin Oriental) in August 1999. The \u00a3150 a month he pays for the attentions of his account manager, Jonathan Wallace, 'definitely make life easier at home'. </p> <p>'I work very hard and there are times with my girlfriend when I really need to pull a rabbit out of the hat. Once when I needed to do something special, Jonathan got us into the Ivy at really short notice. He called at 4pm and we had a table at 8.15. </p> <p>'For Valentine's night, I didn't want to go out, so he arranged to have delicious food delivered to the door. My girlfriend is only aware that Entrust is responsible for about half of it. She thinks I'm very thoughtful, and I put a lot of time and effort into our social life. And in an ideal world, I'd like to.' </p> <p>Getting you into booked-up restaurants is a staple of the lifestyle managers. They don't promise they can always get you into the Ivy, 'but you might make one call and be told no. We often know the person in charge of reservations. We'll call two or three times a week, schmooze, remind them we're still here and we'd love to have the table,' says Jonathan Wallace. </p> <p>Some clients call their account manager twice a day; others a couple of times a week. Most of the jobs they want doing involve mundane domestic maintenance, but occasionally, the butlers will be presented with a challenge. 'We had one client who hated going to the dentist,' says James Hickman. 'We managed to find one who offered virtual reality glasses so that our client could watch a movie while he was in the chair. Someone else's wife had seen a bracelet in a jewellery shop in the main square in Rhodes old town that he wanted to track down. It turns out there are 60 jewellery shops in that square.' Photographs were dispatched across cyberspace, and they did it. </p> <p>By the time your lifestyle manager has put you in the Wimbledon ballot, emailed you with news of opera tickets that happen to be going spare, and told you about this chic new hotel that's just opened in Paris, my guess is you could end up spending quite a lot more money.

      "bodyText": "It is curious that people who are paid lots of money to be efficient and dynamic at work can be completely incompetent at home. They have To Do lists that never get done. They pride themselves on their organisational skills, but can't get round to fixing the leaking tap in the downstairs loo or remember their mother-in-law's birthday. These people need a personal butler. And now they can have one. At least three companies have recently set up in the UK providing what they like to call 'lifestyle managers' to those for whom home is where the paperwork is. For something over \u00a31,000 a year, the rich, successful but domestically challenged young executive (most clients are in their late twenties and early thirties and many are in the City and new technology businesses) can acquire a PA for the home. These lifestyle managers are charged with ensuring that the harassed exec never again has to sit on the end of a phone listening to plinky-plinky music while waiting to be connected to the gas company. The butlers, uniformly bright and breezy, handle between 15 and 20 clients each, many of whom speak to, or email, them every day. For most of us the thought of investigating the best washing machine for our budget, purchasing it, arranging delivery and waiting in for it to arrive (or not), is likely to induce feelings of deep depression. But give this task to a lifestyle manager and they will react as if you had just offered them an exciting holiday. With the same professionally enthused and upbeat demeanour, they will organise builders, check out the cheapest place to buy a mobile phone, get you pushed up the waiting list for the latest Porsche and send flowers to your best friend. Their clients, or 'members', pay for services as and when they receive them, over and above their joining fee. The companies take a cut from the suppliers, 'but we guarantee that as a member, you don't pay more', says James Hickman of Liberate365 (membership: \u00a31,200 per year) which was set up in November 1999 and now has 24 staff serving 200 individuals. It is certainly true that if Liberate were to book a villa, the company could get a travel agent's discount that wouldn't be available to an individual. There are also economies of scale as the companies put business the way of their favoured suppliers. But Sarah Ewing, a 25 year-old journalist and client of Ten (Time Energy Network) UK - \u00a31,175 a year - the longest-established and largest of the companies in this country, accepts that 'services are sometimes slightly more expensive'. 'I asked Mark, my account manager, to get me a cleaner. My boyfriend, who lives in the East London suburbs, pays \u00a34 an hour. I live more centrally and pay \u00a36 an hour, but the cleaning is impeccable, so it's still value for money,' she says. James Hickman suggests that Liberate can even pass on discounts. 'We import cars from abroad for our members, who get a better deal without hassle. And we guarantee the quality of work carried out by our suppliers: we check their books, their references, their quality and value for money, their courtesy. We keep on checking. And despite our stringent requirements, suppliers are now coming to us.' This is beguiling sales talk: a plumber who turns up on time, does the job properly and doesn't rip you off? Too, too marvellous. Alex Cheatle, one of two half-brothers who set up TenUK in 1998, acknowledges that his company has had its work cut out 're-educating the service sector' and admits that 'there is no such thing as the platonic plumber'. The difference, he says, is that TenUK will sort out any problems. Cheatle, a former brand manager for Oil of Ulay, had the idea for TenUK when he was in Peru having a six-month sabbatical 'with a laptop and a rucksack' (personal trainers for your lifestyle tend to be good at stories). He claims not to have known of the US versions - which were a couple of years ahead, and call themselves concierge companies. They are in any case, more like website versions of the Yellow Pages: 'They have all gone down the mass market, technological route, acquiring tens of thousands of members very quickly.' (TenUK also now has a cheaper, website-based service, which is mainly used as a corporate perk). The full butler service costs \u00a31,000, and has 1,000 members assigned to 50 account managers, who range from ex-midwives to former managers at Starbucks. These 'bright young professionals, with whom members can have a peer relationship' are united by their determination to find you the right person to put together your flatpack furniture when you're too lazy or incompetent to do it yourself, and are just longing to wangle you into the perfect country house hotel for a last-minute dirty weekend. And if you want the best tantric sex teacher in London, they can put you in touch immediately, because they've had that one before. William Tyler, 29, runs a company that mounts exhibition displays, and is a client of Entrust, which was set up by five former posh hoteliers (the Savoy, Claridge's, the Mandarin Oriental) in August 1999. The \u00a3150 a month he pays for the attentions of his account manager, Jonathan Wallace, 'definitely make life easier at home'. 'I work very hard and there are times with my girlfriend when I really need to pull a rabbit out of the hat. Once when I needed to do something special, Jonathan got us into the Ivy at really short notice. He called at 4pm and we had a table at 8.15. 'For Valentine's night, I didn't want to go out, so he arranged to have delicious food delivered to the door. My girlfriend is only aware that Entrust is responsible for about half of it. She thinks I'm very thoughtful, and I put a lot of time and effort into our social life. And in an ideal world, I'd like to.' Getting you into booked-up restaurants is a staple of the lifestyle managers. They don't promise they can always get you into the Ivy, 'but you might make one call and be told no. We often know the person in charge of reservations. We'll call two or three times a week, schmooze, remind them we're still here and we'd love to have the table,' says Jonathan Wallace. Some clients call their account manager twice a day; others a couple of times a week. Most of the jobs they want doing involve mundane domestic maintenance, but occasionally, the butlers will be presented with a challenge. 'We had one client who hated going to the dentist,' says James Hickman. 'We managed to find one who offered virtual reality glasses so that our client could watch a movie while he was in the chair. Someone else's wife had seen a bracelet in a jewellery shop in the main square in Rhodes old town that he wanted to track down. It turns out there are 60 jewellery shops in that square.' Photographs were dispatched across cyberspace, and they did it. By the time your lifestyle manager has put you in the Wimbledon ballot, emailed you with news of opera tickets that happen to be going spare, and told you about this chic new hotel that's just opened in Paris, my guess is you could end up spending quite a lot more money. But these services are, after all, for cash-rich, time-poor people. Admittedly, by the time you've emailed your account manager about the leaking tap, you could have called someone to fix it. But it's nicer dealing with Natasha from Liberate, and she'll guarantee that the plumber's OK, and arrange to let him in. And while she's about it, she'll remind you it's your mum's birthday next week, and she likes lilies rather than roses. The rise of the personal butler reflects the fact that running a home is scarcely less onerous than running a business and that, these days, there's often no one to do it. But if remembering family birthdays is so far down our list of priorities that we have to employ someone to do it, what does that say about us? Well, for one thing, that we have a very worshipful and warped attitude to paid work.

The groundsman at Galle, the old Sri Lankan off-spinner, KPJ Warnaweera, has already been dispatched to Kandy to oversee the preparation of the Test wicket and I doubt whether he will be demanding that the mower blades should be raised a notch or two. Expect the pitch to be slow and to turn. Hope Nasser Hussain wins the toss. Admittedly the last time Sri Lanka played at Kandy - against South Africa a year ago - the pitch had different characteristics to the one England encountered in Galle. It was sufficiently damp at the start for Arjuna Ranatunga to insert the opposition upon winning the toss. South Africa won a thriller by seven runs as the bounce became increasingly uneven and low. 40 wickets fell in the match. Four South African wickets were taken by Sri Lankan seamers; four Sri Lankan wickets were taken by South African spinners. Do not anticipate those conditions being repeated when the second Test starts. England have several psychological barriers to overcome; paranoia about the umpires has to be banished; in charge next week are BC Cooray and Rudi Koertzen, neither of whom have impeccable credentials. England's middle order have to fathom a way to score runs against the spinners. And then comes the problem of capturing Sri Lankan wickets. Oddly enough, England were not too disappointed about how they played Murali in the first Test. The little magician did take seven wickets but he had to bowl 97 overs to get them. Marcus Trescothick was the only batsman to score off him with anything approaching freedom, but the most of the rest managed to blunt him for long periods. The problem lay against the other bowlers, most notably Sanath Jayasuriya. They had hoped to score more freely against them. They couldn't for a variety of reasons. Facing such a large first innings total, the batsmen were shackled by the need to save the game; Jayasuriya's unassuming darts were well directed and by the time he was bowling, the pitch was unreliable.

Hussain obviously continues in the team, though he will have spent much of this week agonising over how best to counter the spinners. In the past he has sought to be aggressive early on to establish his authority at the crease. But this method failed him in Pakistan where eventually he opted to graft. He tried that in Galle but was scuppered by Murali in both innings. Meanwhile, the pressure to drop Hick mounts. In the long term England need Michael Vaughan established in the team when the Ashes series starts. In the short term the tour management may feel bound to stick with the hairline decision they took before the Galle Test. They might argue that Hick was betrayed by the umpire in one innings in Galle and there's no doubt that they value their reputation for giving those initially selected a fair go. If they stick with Hick, which is the most likely outcome, it is essential that he risks taking the game to the Sri Lankan spinners rather than defending dourly. Someone should hoodwink Hick into thinking it's a one-day game. After Galle the confidence of the bowlers is no more buoyant than that of Hussain and Hick. The pacemen crave life in the wicket; the spinners crave bowling on a third day pitch. Neither can be guaranteed. Even so England's bowling attack, despite their impotence in Galle, is likely to remain the same. Jason Brown has been gently ostracised, while Andrew Caddick will probably be retained ahead of Matthew Hoggard. The Sri Lankans are far more likely to change their side. The left-arm seamer, Nuwan Zoysa is fit again and will replace that virtual spectator in Galle, Dilhara Fernando. Kumar Dharmesena may give way to the left arm-spinner Dinuk Hettiarchchi.

The left-arm seamer, Nuwan Zoysa is fit again and will replace that virtual spectator in Galle, Dilhara Fernando. Kumar Dharmesena may give way to the left arm-spinner Dinuk Hettiarchchi. This is the time to change the side - when you're winning. \u0095 Second Test Kandy, starts Wednesday (Sky Sports 2 from 4.15am daily)",

But here in Sri Lanka there is just sympathy and of course tea from our hosts. The Sri Lankans we meet in shops, taxis and restaurants, while delighted by their team's victory, all preface their remarks with 'I'm sorry about the umpiring' as if it was their fault. Objectivity is a strain, so first some facts. Out of the 20 English wickets to fall in the first Test, 12 had to be adjudicated by the umpires. Four of those decisions (Stewart and Hick in the first innings, White and Croft in the second) were demonstrably wrong once the TV replays were consulted. Half a dozen were debatable - most lbws are - and because of previous howlers they came under unusually intense scrutiny. This may seem an abnormally high ratio of dismissals requiring the umpires' intervention but on turning dustbowls this is often the case. Batsmen are rarely bowled in these conditions; nor are there straightforward edges into the slip cordon. Everything happens in a flurry around the wicket. It's much easier to umpire in Perth, with its fast, bouncy pitch, than it is in Galle. Undoubtedly the Sri Lankans were noisier in the field than the English - 'over-zealous' is the modern euphemism - though one contributory factor for that is plain to see. When England were in the field during the first two days the ball hit the middle of the bat so frequently that there was limited scope for appeals of any sort. When England batted it was a different matter. The question is: have the Sri Lankans - toughened up during the past decade by their former captain and Observer columnist Arjuna Ranatunga - dragged the game to new depths? For those with limited experience of overseas Test matches, especially in the subcontinent, this is the inescapable conclusion. But it's not mine. Forgive a brisk and fairly random dart into the past where parallels are not hard to find. In 1982-83 when England were in Australia I was mildly chastised for revealing in The Cricketer that the England camp had discussed how they went about their appealing. We concluded that we were not aggressive enough. I wrote 'When appealing, the Aussies make a statement; we ask a question.' We tried to change tack. On the next two winter tours there were plenty of controversies similar to those provoked by the Galle Test. In Pakistan in 1983, the umpiring and appealing rankled with the English tourists, which led to an almost surreal 'dressing down' of the most gentlemanly of cricketers, Bob Taylor, in the pavilion in Lahore. David Gower, newly appointed captain, was instructed by the management to read the riot act to Taylor, who had shown dissent. Gower just avoided smiling throughout the charade and it was a rebuke no more stinging than those delivered by John le Mesurier in Dad's Army . In 1984, in Bombay, England felt betrayed by the umpiring of the gigantic Swaroop Kishen and much frantic Indian appealing. After debate the team concluded that they had to grin and bear it rather than descend into paranoia. </p> <p>And so it goes on; mayhem in Pakistan in 1987-88 on Mike Gatting's tour. Fast forward to 1998 in Adelaide where Mike Atherton suffered a similar dismissal to the one in the second innings in Galle. Atherton was far more certain that Mark Taylor had failed to take the catch at slip than he was about the 'catch' to Sangakkara in Galle. The press-box reaction in Adelaide, having studied the replays time and time again, was instructive. To a man, the Aussie section all thought the ball had carried to Taylor; the English camp all thought it hadn't. So much for objectivity. </p> <p>Nor should we fall into the trap of thinking that England are the only victims of dubious umpiring and appealing. I hesitate to mention it, but my first Test wicket at a crucial moment in the Headingley Test of 1982 may have been - how shall I put it? - dodgy. The Pakistanis certainly thought so. Think how the South Africans suffered at Headingley in 1998 or Wavell Hinds throughout the series last summer. My point is that there is nothing new in excessive appealing or umpiring errors. These may not be palatable elements of the game, but they have always happened. Even Wally Hammond remained certain to his dying day that Don Bradman had caught him on the half-volley in the opening Test of the 1946-47 series. </p> <p>What has changed, thanks to the advance of technology, is that many decisions can now be proven to be wrong - so it seems increasingly daft not to use that technology when it can help. Once umpires are proven by the camera to be making bad decisions, it is only natural that players - from any country - opt to make ever more outlandish appeals in an attempt to redress the balance. This week Alec Stewart, who has no problems with antics of his Sri Lankan counterpart behind the stumps, spelt out his policy with commendable frankness: 'If I think I've got a chance of getting a decision, I'll appeal.' Not, you notice, 'If I think it's out, I'll appeal.' Duncan Fletcher has suggested an ingenious 'referral system' which would allow each side to refer three debatable decisions taken in the middle in each innings to the third umpire One of its strengths is that it should encourage the players themselves to police the game because incorrect appeals, if pursued, would be penalised with the loss of one of the three referrals per innings. Why not experiment with this system? Demonstrably bad umpiring is the spark for the excesses. When those excesses occur, a fine is a waste of time - you're never sure who pays them anyway - and suspension is the only worthwhile sanction. </p> <p>I'm afraid I also take the 'unpatriotic' line when assessing the pitch in Galle. Yes, it suited the home side perfectly, but there is nothing new in that either.The quality of a pitch should be measured by how it plays, not how it looks. Given that five wickets had fallen in the match by lunch on the third day it is tricky to condemn the one in Galle. I do not subscribe to the view that England would have won the match if they had won what was admittedly a crucial toss. They would probably have avoided defeat. Moreover the English are not in a position to bleat about the state of the pitch in Galle (not that the management has done so in public). Consider all the recent three-day Tests at Edgbaston and Headingley on surfaces that have been ideally suited to England's strength, their seam attack. Those pitches may not have been wittingly prepared to aid the home side, but that is not a distinction that visiting sides are likely to make. England deserve sympathy after Galle. But self-pity and outrage are misplaced. To be fair to the tourists they appear to be avoiding that trap as the days trickle by before the Kandy Test. What they would like in Kandy is some reliable umpiring and some pace in the pitch, which gives all of their bowlers a chance to influence the game. Both may be forlorn hopes.</p>",

The results pretty much evened out, but I can see how a young player may feel their career threatened by an unfavourable decision.

It has amused me greatly to see the British press reaction to the events in Galle.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I particularly support your stance on Shakespeare - but Milton, Pope, Woolf? We're talking about 14 to 16-year-olds for GCSE, and it's very difficult to envisage many of them coping in any meaningful way with such difficult writers. Joyce? - Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man perhaps - but certainly not Ulysses!</p> <p>If we pitch the level so far above youngsters' ability and experience, they'll soon detest the very idea of reading. Enjoyment of more accessible fare (please consult some teachers or your children's literature reviewers!) will lead to tackling some of those mentioned - probably after A levels! <br> Rod Evans</p> <p>\u0095 Writing from Canada - backwaterish despite British admiration and Booker lavishments for some of its writers - it is still something of a surprise to learn that the 'flower of English literature' must leave Americans to wilt among the weeds. At the very least room should be made for Melville. The greatest English novel of the 19th century may well be Middlemarch; the greatest novel in English of the 19th century is Moby-Dick. And why do the English still refuse to recognize Faulkner? <br> Karim Mamdani<br>Canada</p> <p>\u0095 I'd have few grumbles with your canonical list (apart from the inclusion of Stevenson, Wilde in preference to Yeats, and the Brontes - those Woman's Weekly writers - as a possible alternative to Dickens, for heaven's sake!). But the chalk-face practicalities are against you.</p> <p>For many years now, the young - even at A-level - have been simply unable to cope with the length, syntactical complexity and breadth of reference that they find in writers like Milton, Pope and Dickens. The cultural threads have been cut and one might as well give them some Pharaonic or Sumerian text to look at. For the young, the appeal has got to be pretty instant. Great writing demands patience. Why bother with Dickens when everything around them is screaming \"Now! Now! Now!\"? <br> Peter Sampson<br>Suffolk</p> <p>\u0095 Normally my hackles would rise, but I can only be grateful that you actually forgot the existence of Wales in your pointless top ten exercise. It wasn't so much that you didn't choose any Welsh writers - on a canonical list of ten English-language writers I think that's probably fair enough. But you ignored Wales entirely. I think the two Thomases (RS and Dylan) at least deserve consideration, particularly Dylan for Under Milk Wood and maybe Deaths &amp; Entrances. <br> Stevie Krayer</p> <p>\u0095 I thoroughly enjoyed this engaging Top Ten with lots of irksome omissions. It is a vital antidote to the kind of philistinism inherent in a debates that's come to be caricatured in terms of kicking Shakespeare off the syllabus.</p> <p>But there is also a danger here of trivialising a pernicious trend. The suggestion, as I understand it, is not merely to replace Shakespeare with Media Studies: the plan is to do away with the whole canon of literature in English. It isn't simply a case of developing a more popular and accessible syllabus - more black writers, women writers, living authors and contemporary themes. The report in The Guardian suggested that neo-Gradgrinds advising the DfEE advocated replacing classic fiction with 'applied' communication skills of temporary relevance to potential employers like 'Information Management'.</p> <p>If those with the opportunity to influence attitudes to the teaching of literature fail to highlight the real issues in this debate, in thirty years only the narrowest of academic elites will be able to challenge the Literary Editor's top ten. But the less fortunate majority will be at least be able to express his dilemma over the inclusion of Pope, Sterne or Johnson in the form of an elegant flow-chart. <br> Andy Hedgecock<br>Nottingham</p> <p>\u0095 A twenty-nine year old friend of mine has just discovered Shakespeare. He didn't do much at school and from the age of sixteen was a drug-addict and alcoholic. He has recently emerged from a long period of rehabilitation and joined our local amateur drama society where he discovered a talent for acting which had lain dormant for years.</p> <p>His first part was Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest in which he gave a remarkable performance. As carefully as possible I began to introduce him to Shakespeare.

      "bodyText": "I particularly support your stance on Shakespeare - but Milton, Pope, Woolf? We're talking about 14 to 16-year-olds for GCSE, and it's very difficult to envisage many of them coping in any meaningful way with such difficult writers. Joyce? - Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man perhaps - but certainly not Ulysses! If we pitch the level so far above youngsters' ability and experience, they'll soon detest the very idea of reading. Enjoyment of more accessible fare (please consult some teachers or your children's literature reviewers!) will lead to tackling some of those mentioned - probably after A levels! Rod Evans \u0095 Writing from Canada - backwaterish despite British admiration and Booker lavishments for some of its writers - it is still something of a surprise to learn that the 'flower of English literature' must leave Americans to wilt among the weeds. At the very least room should be made for Melville. The greatest English novel of the 19th century may well be Middlemarch; the greatest novel in English of the 19th century is Moby-Dick. And why do the English still refuse to recognize Faulkner? Karim Mamdani Canada \u0095 I'd have few grumbles with your canonical list (apart from the inclusion of Stevenson, Wilde in preference to Yeats, and the Brontes - those Woman's Weekly writers - as a possible alternative to Dickens, for heaven's sake!). But the chalk-face practicalities are against you. For many years now, the young - even at A-level - have been simply unable to cope with the length, syntactical complexity and breadth of reference that they find in writers like Milton, Pope and Dickens. The cultural threads have been cut and one might as well give them some Pharaonic or Sumerian text to look at. For the young, the appeal has got to be pretty instant. Great writing demands patience. Why bother with Dickens when everything around them is screaming \"Now! Now! Now!\"? Peter Sampson Suffolk \u0095 Normally my hackles would rise, but I can only be grateful that you actually forgot the existence of Wales in your pointless top ten exercise. It wasn't so much that you didn't choose any Welsh writers - on a canonical list of ten English-language writers I think that's probably fair enough. But you ignored Wales entirely. I think the two Thomases (RS and Dylan) at least deserve consideration, particularly Dylan for Under Milk Wood and maybe Deaths &amp; Entrances. Stevie Krayer \u0095 I thoroughly enjoyed this engaging Top Ten with lots of irksome omissions. It is a vital antidote to the kind of philistinism inherent in a debates that's come to be caricatured in terms of kicking Shakespeare off the syllabus. But there is also a danger here of trivialising a pernicious trend. The suggestion, as I understand it, is not merely to replace Shakespeare with Media Studies: the plan is to do away with the whole canon of literature in English. It isn't simply a case of developing a more popular and accessible syllabus - more black writers, women writers, living authors and contemporary themes. The report in The Guardian suggested that neo-Gradgrinds advising the DfEE advocated replacing classic fiction with 'applied' communication skills of temporary relevance to potential employers like 'Information Management'. If those with the opportunity to influence attitudes to the teaching of literature fail to highlight the real issues in this debate, in thirty years only the narrowest of academic elites will be able to challenge the Literary Editor's top ten. But the less fortunate majority will be at least be able to express his dilemma over the inclusion of Pope, Sterne or Johnson in the form of an elegant flow-chart. Andy Hedgecock Nottingham \u0095 A twenty-nine year old friend of mine has just discovered Shakespeare. He didn't do much at school and from the age of sixteen was a drug-addict and alcoholic. He has recently emerged from a long period of rehabilitation and joined our local amateur drama society where he discovered a talent for acting which had lain dormant for years. His first part was Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest in which he gave a remarkable performance. As carefully as possible I began to introduce him to Shakespeare. At first he was hostile, having the received street-wisdom that Shakespeare is crap, but I persevered and gave him a tape of Henry IV Part 1, together with the text. He read and listened. He has hardly ever read a book. I also gave him a copy of Just So Stories, to please me he read it and loved it, even reading The Butterfly That Stamped to his girlfriend in hospital. I persuaded him to come down to London with us where he saw the RSC do Henry IV. He was absolutely bowled over. The rest of the week he saw Playboy of the Western World, The Importance, Six Characters in search of an Author, Merrily We Roll Along, and Mouth to Mouth. He's now in the process of learning audition pieces for drama school, one of which is a speech of Hotspur's. He can hardly believe the change in himself. I am so delighted for him. It may be the theatre that has begun the magic transformation, or Shakespeare, or simply the wonderful power of words wielded by writers of genius. The finest literature is a unique combination of words and content - but I believe it's the words first that work the magic with their sounds and cadences, not politically correct messages fashionable for the times.

So many people have strong motives it could even turn out to be JR, but just as with the Dallas shooting, the smart money is on the least interesting and most dispensable character (who remembers Kristin anyway?): yup, it just has to be Dan. </p> <p>It was vintage <strong>EastEnders</strong> all week, culminating, of course, in the wedding of Steve and Mel, perhaps E20's most blindingly star-cross'd couple yet. Still, they know how to put a brave face on despair in Albert Square, so the prospect of even the grimmest nuptials is also an opportunity to wear a nice frock. Even desperate Lisa, Phil's ex-squeeze, who had spent Monday and Tuesday looking like a suicide risk, scrubbed up remarkably well for Mel's hen night, sparkly d\u00e9colletage and all. </p> <p>I wish Lisa would do something about those eyebrows, though - a pair of acute-grave caterpillars punctuating her face like the panstick crosses favoured by sad mimes. She's a pretty girl but there's something about those brows which scream 'victim'. No excuse for Phil to be quite so vile to her, of course ('Mel's got something you haven't, the ability to satisfy a man,' he hissed. 'But we had something special,' whined Lisa. 'No. You had something special. I had something convenient...'), but she really should pop up west and treat herself to a self-esteem-boosting professional pluck. </p> <p>Martin Kemp's mum is Sheila Hancock! Gatecrashing the wedding (lovely registry office; surely not in the neighbourhood?) and wearing black with a magnificent hat, she looked just like Camilla Parker Bowles and sounded like Mystic Meg. 'So, tell me, do you know the bride?' she asked Phil, who'd also crashed and to whom, naturally, she took an instant shine. 'And, by the way, your lucky numbers are 7 and 11, your lucky colour is red and the winning Thunderball ticket is in the tea caddy.' </p> <p>She and Phil made a great pair, and if Phil survives the shooting I hope they will go on to launch a suitably evil joint business venture - stealing dalmatian puppies, perhaps. In the meantime, however, Phil's got his hands full dealing with a long overdue karmic comeuppance for which there are really only two possible outcomes: Phil dies or, in hospital, he loses a lot of weight and turns into Keith Allen. Ooh, scary! </p> <p>Until <strong>In Deep</strong>, ex-EastEnder Nick Berry, Mr Nice Guy, Housewives Fave, had never (to my knowledge) played a tortured soul and he isn't playing one now, to be honest. But I can see why, after a thousand years in Heartbeat and that dreadful bit of business by the seaside, he would want to stretch himself, slam a few doors, crease his pretty brow, run around with a shooter and sleep with women other than his wife, just as Ant and Dec will at some point want to appear at the Donmar in Waiting for Godot directed by Sam Mendes. Anyway, if Berry's inner turmoil remains just that - etched only on his insides - his undercover cop partner, Stephen Tompkinson, is distressingly hairy and anguished on the outside and surprisingly good at tortured. Then again, he's got even more emotional baggage than Berry, what with Ballykissangel. </p> <p>Last week's undercover plot was a sordid though timely trawl through an internet paedophile ring. The Gretel Club was masterminded by Donald Sumpter (right up there with Frank Finlay as the very incarnation of smooth, silver-haired menace), his son and the local GP, while the female officer in charge of cracking the case announced she 'wouldn't settle for less' than life sentences for this lot of sleazebuckets, which was noble but na\u00efve - hadn't she followed the Wonderland trial? </p> <p>These days, there are far too many dramas relying on paedophiles to drive the plot. You can see why, but even when handled by Nick Berry with kid gloves - and no kids - it's not really a suitable subject for light entertainment, surely. And if the rabble who, last summer, conducted vigilante attacks on paediatricians can get it so wrong, what hope for the likes of Sumpter? Perhaps the News of the World might like to publish an at-risk register for all the poor jobbing thesps who have to play scum of the earth. </p> <p>Though marginally less horrible than being a jobbing paedophile, life as a fading 'flopstar' still looks pretty grim. We caught up with the nation's favourite failures in <strong>Nearly Popstars</strong>, the same week that Hear'say (why didn't they just call the band Popstars and have done with it?) made their live debut (with an awful lot of backing singers) at the Brits. Anyway, the hilarious Darius (the tabloids' 'pain in the arius') is still full of it - 'Fame is like a drug. It's a dangerous thing and it has to be handled carefully' - while Claire of 'the unconventional image' (though the only unconventional thing about being fat is, surely, using the word 'unconventional' to describe it) now has herself a manager and a small part in an independent film, but has also declined the advances of established record labels in favour of starting her own (very bad move, Claire). </p> <p>Sliding yet further down the slippery snake of the poptabulous fame game were Ian, Gary and David who had made the last 20 in Popstars but were now being stalked by Tam, a fat (unconventional?) manager who had two other lads waiting on the sidelines in order to construct a boy band destined for swift and profound failure. </p> <p>Happily, the three flopstars recognised this and escaped, though unfortunately Ian - the one rejected by Nigel Lythgoe for looking too much like a used-car dealer - decided to go solo. He is now managed by a man called Andy who runs 'north Norfolk's first record label' from a caravan park and who quickly hauled Ian off to a high street photographer for some publicity pics, accessorised by a hubcap. 'Some facial shots,' instructed Andy, who is hoping to get sponsorship for Ian from local second-hand car dealers. I don't hold out much hope for Ian's facial shots or his pop future, but there is undoubtedly a great deal of comedy mileage to be had from Andy's career and I hope we'll be seeing much more of him. </p> <p> While so much TV foreign correspondence is of the rather earnest, po-faced 'I've got a flak jacket and I'm going to use it' school of reporting, BBC2's <strong>Langan Behind the Lines</strong> was deeply entertaining and therefore compulsive viewing. Sean just isn't a flak-jacket type of guy which, at times, made his journey through the Middle East (from Afghanistan to Gaza, via Iran and Iraq) a bit like a moveable chat-show rather than a self-consciously improving documentary strand. I've known Sean for years, so initially I had no intention of reviewing Behind the Lines, but then it turned out to be best thing buried in last week's late-night schedules so it would have been churlish not to. Perhaps BBC2 was slightly embarrassed by the show's shameless accessibility, but it really should have been on at eight. </p> <p>Langan was a guest on Wednesday's Midweek on Radio 4, during which Libby Purves mentioned that he was a former style journalist (the unspoken inference being that a former style journalist was highly unlikely to bring very much in the way of gravitas to a documentary series on the Middle East, though presumably plenty of pithy, if fluffy, observations on Islamic dress codes). Maybe Langan perceived this as a slight (he certainly ignored it) but he needn't have worried: I thought he managed to combine deep gravitas while reporting on the Taliban's trouser-wearing trends with a deft levity when it came to, say, the Gaza Strippers - though of course I would say that, given as I'm a fluffy style journalist whose interaction with the Middle East extends about as far as driving past Regent's Park mosque on the way to the office. </p> <p>At last! In <strong>The West Wing</strong>, not only has Martin Sheen's First Lady returned from executing good Democrat deeds in Pakistan - or wherever it is she's been hiding in plot purdah for the last few weeks - but she turns out to be the magnificent Stockard Channing, too. I'm not sure if Hillary was encouraged to show off quite as much heaving embonpoint as Channing revealed during Thursday's awkward state dinner for the Indonesian President, but I love Mrs Bartlet's political style (a Badgley Mischka frock and Manolo Blahnik shoes).

For this is a novel about men in a society that has tried to redefine their role and reprogramme their intellect but can never override their genetic legacy. </p> <p>Oliver Verbier, Andrea's much younger 'life-space-partner', is the epitome of all that twenty-first century middle-class men are expected to strive towards. An osteopath with a private practice who runs a self-awareness men's discussion group on Tuesdays and has devoted most of his adult life to eating organic food and sublimating his baser desires, Oliver is shy and well-meaning and ought to feel a sense of achievement in having raised his masculinity to a higher plane. So why does he feel such a guilty sense of relief at Andrea's death, and why can't he walk past a knicker advert without the inconvenience of a ferocious erection, and why on earth does he keep the phone number of a woman who likes to be spanked for money hidden in a biscuit tin? </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum is Barry Fox, Andrea's ex-husband and a thoroughly unreconstructed grubby columnist who owes thousands in back rent, cheerfully believes that women like to be objectified, and whose bloodstream is clotted with alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, cholesterol and pure self-loathing which finds its expression in fierce scathing anger at the STUPIDITY of the rest of the world, who are categorised variously as 'POOFTERS', 'BUTT-PLUNGING PISSANTS' or, worse still, 'frigging OSTEOPATHS'. </p> <p>The two are drawn to each other in the aftermath of Andrea's death; Barry because he realises the Clapham house in which Oliver resides is still nominally his and is now worth \u00a3800,000, and Oliver because he's too weak to tell Barry to get lost. But when Barry drinks his way to a heart attack after a spectacular performance at Oliver's Tuesday club, and Oliver takes him in to recuperate, a kind of understanding develops as both begin to recognise their own deficiencies. </p> <p>Although Planer's characters appear at first glance to be drawn according to easily recognisable types, his use of free indirect style, together with his acute ear for well-timed comic dialogue, allows them to accumulate psychological depth. Barry, in particular, is a magnificent comic creation with a fine arsenal of verbose and withering insults, and the polarisation of the two men gives Planer the chance to offer subtle apologetics for hard-wired male behaviour, and to watch both move towards what Oliver would call a more 'holistic' masculinity by hilariously adopting some of the other's traits. </p> <p>Planer combines the novel's sustained humour with often tender insights into the confusion of men's emotions, but the comedy has the upper hand; Barry's night at the men's group is a perfectly paced comic scene balancing slapstick and wit, in the tradition of Kingsley Amis's Jim Dixon and his Merrie England lecture.</p>",

Oliver Verbier, Andrea's much younger 'life-space-partner', is the epitome of all that twenty-first century middle-class men are expected to strive towards. An osteopath with a private practice who runs a self-awareness men's discussion group on Tuesdays and has devoted most of his adult life to eating organic food and sublimating his baser desires, Oliver is shy and well-meaning and ought to feel a sense of achievement in having raised his masculinity to a higher plane. So why does he feel such a guilty sense of relief at Andrea's death, and why can't he walk past a knicker advert without the inconvenience of a ferocious erection, and why on earth does he keep the phone number of a woman who likes to be spanked for money hidden in a biscuit tin? At the other end of the spectrum is Barry Fox, Andrea's ex-husband and a thoroughly unreconstructed grubby columnist who owes thousands in back rent, cheerfully believes that women like to be objectified, and whose bloodstream is clotted with alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, cholesterol and pure self-loathing which finds its expression in fierce scathing anger at the STUPIDITY of the rest of the world, who are categorised variously as 'POOFTERS', 'BUTT-PLUNGING PISSANTS' or, worse still, 'frigging OSTEOPATHS'. The two are drawn to each other in the aftermath of Andrea's death; Barry because he realises the Clapham house in which Oliver resides is still nominally his and is now worth \u00a3800,000, and Oliver because he's too weak to tell Barry to get lost. But when Barry drinks his way to a heart attack after a spectacular performance at Oliver's Tuesday club, and Oliver takes him in to recuperate, a kind of understanding develops as both begin to recognise their own deficiencies. Although Planer's characters appear at first glance to be drawn according to easily recognisable types, his use of free indirect style, together with his acute ear for well-timed comic dialogue, allows them to accumulate psychological depth. Barry, in particular, is a magnificent comic creation with a fine arsenal of verbose and withering insults, and the polarisation of the two men gives Planer the chance to offer subtle apologetics for hard-wired male behaviour, and to watch both move towards what Oliver would call a more 'holistic' masculinity by hilariously adopting some of the other's traits. Planer combines the novel's sustained humour with often tender insights into the confusion of men's emotions, but the comedy has the upper hand; Barry's night at the men's group is a perfectly paced comic scene balancing slapstick and wit, in the tradition of Kingsley Amis's Jim Dixon and his Merrie England lecture.",

      "body": "<p>Third generation mobile-phone services will transform our lives say the telecoms operators, painting a vision of a world in which we can switch on our central heating, order a pizza, download a film and invite our friends around to share them with us from the top of a bus on the way home from work. </p> <p>The vision is alluring, but that is all. The techno-wonks will wax lyrical for hours on end about the possibilities of 3G. But so far, none of the mobile-phone companies has spelled out exactly what 3G services they will be offering, never mind how much we will pay for them. </p> <p>Given the scale of investment in 3G, it is a worrying gap. Between them, Vodafone, Orange, BT and the European operators such as Deutsche Telecom and Telecom Italia will spend around \u20ac120 billion (\u00a375bn) buying the licences alone. </p> <p>Add in the costs of building the networks for 3G services - masts, switches and the like - and the cost soars to more than \u20ac300bn. So far, the focus has been on how the industry will finance that investment. But the key issue is now becoming how they will make a return on it. </p> <p>'The costs of the network are not the critical things for the operator,' said Mike Grant, head of the mobile communications division at consultants Analysys , one of the advisers to the British government on the sale of 3G licences. 'What is critical is the amount they will have to spend on developing the services - marketing them, subsidising the move to new handsets and so on. You have to look at what you think that will cost per customer per year to attract and keep them, and what you can generate from them.' </p> <p>Analysys's calculation sounds daunting. On its models, the average revenue per user (ARPU) has to rise by between 60 and 100 per cent in real terms over the next 10 years to give the operators a return of between 20 and 25 per cent on their investment. Given that ARPU has been declining for three years as more and more people take up cheaper pre-paid services, and that competition is forcing rates down even further, it looks like a tall order. </p> <p>Analysys does expect the industry to fall into loss over the next four to five years. But, adds Grant, the ability to offer services such as betting, videogames and other entertainment over handsets means there is more than enough in the pie to generate that kind of revenue. He points to the success of i-mode, the data service launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan, to support his case. </p> <p>By the end of February, i-mode had 19.6 million subscribers, double the number just six months ago. Its recent results show that 10 per cent of its revenue is now coming from these new data services, which has meant its ARPU has stopped falling and is now flat. </p> <p>Others dismiss the i-mode example, saying the Japanese are technophiles who take to new gadgets with far more enthusiasm than the rest of us. But Grant points out that much of i-mode's revenue comes from customers downloading ringing tones and logos of their favourite comic character, which they can then send on to their friends. </p> <p>As any rail traveller will testify, everyone loves a personalised ringing tone. In Finland, for example, 10 million were downloaded last year - a cost of around \u00a31 a shot - in a population of just 3 million. </p> <p>But 3G must be about more than just making your phone sound like waves breaking on a tropical beach. Where is the killer application, the service that will make a 3G phone a must-have for every mobile user? So far, noone seems to have come up with the answer. </p> <p>Mark James, telecoms analyst at Nomura, said there was 'very little discussion of services' at the 3G congress held last month in Cannes. Some are debating whether it is possible to emulate the runaway success of text messaging by combining it with something like AOL's Buddy system, which tells you when friends are online. </p> <p>Even that, however, has been inconclusive.Text messaging has been one of the unexpected successes of the mobile phone era. Dismissed initially, it now provides more than 5 per cent of revenues and usage is growing rapidly. </p> <p>Stephen Pentland of Spectrum Consulting, which has advised a number of governments on 3G licence auctions, says there is 'an enormous degree of excitement about the potential' of text messaging. They could be used, for example, to remind you when your favourite soap opera is on, or to give you a preview of it; to give you the football results; or as an interactive tool allowing you to vote on the ending to a film. </p> <p>But he questions whether the operators are doing enough to realise that potential. Few are talking to television or sports companies about ways of packaging the services to make them attractive to users. 'They are trying to develop their own portals. But they need a willingness to learn what makes the content interesting to users,' he said. </p> <p>The operators themselves seem to have only a vague idea of what they will actually be offering. Vodafone, for example, said: 'We hope to become a global supermarket, not just a distributor of products and services. We want to make it possible for people to control and run their lives from their mobile devices.' </p> <p>When pressed on exactly how that will happen, however, he simply points to Vodafone's internet portal, Vizzavi. Intel, the US electronics giant, attributes the lack of progress partly to the lack of a common standard, or platform, around which software providers can work. That, he says, is what revolutionised the personal computer market. 'If your PC only had the applications which were on it when you bought it, the popularity would not be as broad as it is today,' said Intel's Leif Persson. 'It is the fact that you can add services to it that makes it popular.' </p> <p>Intel is interested in selling its personal internet client architecture but, even so, Persson has a point. The mobile industry needs to encourage an army of software developers to devise products we can use on our phones in the hope that one of them becomes the 'killer' application that will persuade us to fork out not just for the handset but for the kind of services that will make 3G a respectable investment. </p> <p>James' forecasts, which do envisage a decent return on 3G investment eventually, are based on everyone in Britain having a phone - at the moment, around 60 per cent of us has a mobile - and spending 3 per cent of their income on its services, up from the current 2 per cent. But he points out that the service is not perfect - interrupted calls are the norm, phoning anywhere outside the country is tedious and text messaging numbs the fingers. </p> <p>The industry has some way to go to convince us that it can make a go of the next generation.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The audience at London's Old Vic theatre on Friday night had come along to witness the claustrophobic discomfort of the bourgeoisie in Yasmina Reza's new hit play, Life x 3. In fact, they need only have looked around them. Standing in the grand foyer, the assembled theatre-goers were a study in self-conscious gentility.</p> <p>'Oh, good! It's got Imelda Staunton in it! I haven't ever seen a duff play here so I hope this one is OK too,' said one woman. 'Is it going to be one of those depressing plays you have to go out and have several bottles of wine to recover from, I wonder?' asked another.</p> <p>The sentiments echoed comments by Sir Richard Eyre, former artistic director of the Royal National Theatre. At a conference last week he chose to come clean about the 'head-burning, ball-breaking, bowel-churning' badness of much of British theatre. He didn't mean it in a nice way either. He went on to suggest there should be a radical change in the way theatre is looked at in this country. He called on the Government to make tickets much cheaper and to promote drama in schools.</p> <p>Eyre's words come at a sensitive time for theatre. For a start, the row he has started deliberately heralds the announcement this Thursday of the Arts Council of England's funding grants to regional theatres. This will be the first part of an extra \u00a325 million promised to theatre by government last year and it is to go, in the main, to producing theatres, touring theatres, black theatre and children's theatre. It will also disappoint several companies struggling for survival.</p> <p>Last Wednesday Tony Blair was visited at Downing Street by a 'think-tank' of creative talent who hoped to impress upon him the importance of standing up for the arts. The group of 15 leading figures, including John Tusa of the Barbican, theatre director Jude Kelly and Nicholas Serota of the Tate, argued that it should not be electorally embarrassing for a politician to admit to enjoying a bit of Ibsen.</p> <p>'To have the arts off the passionate agenda is simply not good enough,' said Kelly, the outspoken and Olivier award-winning director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse, as she criticised New Labour for only associating themselves with theatre behind closed doors and 'among consenting adults'. 'The greatest achievements in the arts are a mixture of extraordinary technique and visionary imagination. That can be hard to achieve and hard to understand,' she said.</p> <p>Then, the very next day, Eyre - one of their own - broke ranks and branded the art form a high-brow 'rip-off'.</p> <p>On Friday night the punters at the Old Vic were certainly aware of the cost. 'I need a programme and I am going to get one,' announced one patron, 'but if it's a rip-off, I won't buy one because I don't like being ripped off.' He came back without a \u00a33 programme.</p> <p>In London, theatre-going is certainly an expensive hobby.

      "bodyText": "The audience at London's Old Vic theatre on Friday night had come along to witness the claustrophobic discomfort of the bourgeoisie in Yasmina Reza's new hit play, Life x 3. In fact, they need only have looked around them. Standing in the grand foyer, the assembled theatre-goers were a study in self-conscious gentility. 'Oh, good! It's got Imelda Staunton in it! I haven't ever seen a duff play here so I hope this one is OK too,' said one woman. 'Is it going to be one of those depressing plays you have to go out and have several bottles of wine to recover from, I wonder?' asked another. The sentiments echoed comments by Sir Richard Eyre, former artistic director of the Royal National Theatre. At a conference last week he chose to come clean about the 'head-burning, ball-breaking, bowel-churning' badness of much of British theatre. He didn't mean it in a nice way either. He went on to suggest there should be a radical change in the way theatre is looked at in this country. He called on the Government to make tickets much cheaper and to promote drama in schools. Eyre's words come at a sensitive time for theatre. For a start, the row he has started deliberately heralds the announcement this Thursday of the Arts Council of England's funding grants to regional theatres. This will be the first part of an extra \u00a325 million promised to theatre by government last year and it is to go, in the main, to producing theatres, touring theatres, black theatre and children's theatre. It will also disappoint several companies struggling for survival. Last Wednesday Tony Blair was visited at Downing Street by a 'think-tank' of creative talent who hoped to impress upon him the importance of standing up for the arts. The group of 15 leading figures, including John Tusa of the Barbican, theatre director Jude Kelly and Nicholas Serota of the Tate, argued that it should not be electorally embarrassing for a politician to admit to enjoying a bit of Ibsen. 'To have the arts off the passionate agenda is simply not good enough,' said Kelly, the outspoken and Olivier award-winning director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse, as she criticised New Labour for only associating themselves with theatre behind closed doors and 'among consenting adults'. 'The greatest achievements in the arts are a mixture of extraordinary technique and visionary imagination. That can be hard to achieve and hard to understand,' she said. Then, the very next day, Eyre - one of their own - broke ranks and branded the art form a high-brow 'rip-off'. On Friday night the punters at the Old Vic were certainly aware of the cost. 'I need a programme and I am going to get one,' announced one patron, 'but if it's a rip-off, I won't buy one because I don't like being ripped off.' He came back without a \u00a33 programme. In London, theatre-going is certainly an expensive hobby. With a booking fee, programmes and drinks, an evening for two will set you back in the region of \u00a370. At the end of Reza's play, which follows her phenomenally successful Art, the audience were philosophical about the cost. Margaret Crawford, a 30-year-old financial manager, said it was not that much in comparison with the cost of a night spent clubbing: 'I might not have paid this much when I was younger, but I think if you really want to see something you can save up \u00a332.50,' she said.

The language of the communiqu\u00e9 that followed a congress of the party affiliated to the late Croatian president, Franjo Tudjman, bears all the hallmarks of that which sparked the wars that tore ex-Yugoslavia apart, and especially that between the erstwhile Croatian and Muslim allies, which it echoes exactly. In the still divided and symbolically charged city of Mostar, with a rain-drenched crowd of thousands cheering outside, the Bosnian branch of Dr Tudjman's HDZ party resurrected their wartime demand for autonomy, setting themselves on a collision course with Western leaders and ratcheting up the rising tension in the Balkans by yet another notch. Ante Javelic, leader of the dominant HDZ in Bosnia, said that unless electoral changes were made to the federation's constitution and electoral system within 15 days, the Croats would form their own 'inter-cantonal' system of government - effectively ripping up the Dayton treaty, spurning the Sarajevo government and returning to the demands of the Bosnian Croat army that fought the Muslims throughout 1993. Both the language and tactics of the announcement exactly echo some of the darkest days of the Bosnian war. Javelic's sudden proclamation also coincides with a revived hard-line nationalism within Croatia and mass demonstrations in the coastal port of Split, with tens of thousands protesting against arrests by The Hague tribunal of leading figures under president Tudjman's regime. The electoral changes the HDZ seeks are those which draw constituency lines irrespective of ethnicity, which dilutes the power of nationalist parties and favours reformist and multi-ethnic ones. Mr Javelic said the threat of self-rule was a 'temporary' one, but that the party - which dominates the Croatian area of Herzegovina - had in mind to rewrite Dayton to organise Bosnia into a canton system based around the three ethnic groups. The council would assume legislative, judicial and executive powers. Western diplomats indicated yesterday they would not tolerate the Croatian plan.

He has quietly distributed more income to the bottom 10 per cent than any other Labour chancellor, and is set to launch a period of sustained investment in public services unmatched since the war. If Labour can survive a succession of small scandals with its opinion poll lead undented, it is largely due to Mr Brown's stewardship of the economy - which he will seal with his fifth budget on Wednesday.</p> <p>A mark of his success is that the Conservatives now set their policies within his agenda. Gone are Tory promises of across-the-board tax cuts or scaremongering about Labour's tax bombshells. Instead Mr Hague has promised to match Labour's spending plans on health, education, transport and crime trying to emulate Mr Brown's targeted approach to tax cuts.</p> <p>Mr Brown will continue in the same vein on Wednesday. Despite sniping from the IMF, which worries insanely that it is improper for governments to borrow to finance capital investment, the Chancellor has an embarrassment of riches. His surplus this year will match last year's \u00a316 billion, allowing him scope to cut taxes or raise spending by up to \u00a35bn next financial year and still meet his own rules of fiscal probity.</p> <p>He is expected to produce a balanced package, focusing on additional help to children and pensioners while promising a build-up of social investment in Britain's depressed cities and towns. All this will be widely welcomed and will come on top of a substantial \u00a314bn spending programme aimed at children, poorer families and pensioners, based on decisions he took last year. The effects of all this will be felt this this year. Why not use the \u00a35bn to make a real difference by focusing all of it on one or two agenda-setting projects?</p> <p>Here are some suggestions. The Chancellor could commit to reducing class sizes in primary schools to the best in the world (\u00a33bn) while launching a five-year programme of urban regeneration to rebuild Britain's poorest 10 cities (\u00a32bn per annum). Or he could bring forward his ambitions to halve child poverty by 2010 to 2005 (\u00a32.5bn a year) and increase the state pension by \u00a35 a week (\u00a32.5bn a year). Or he could follow the example of America's 120 billionaires and come out strongly in favour of inheritance and capital gains tax, raising sufficient to finance all four spending programmes. We expect the more cautious package - but we would be delighted to be surprised.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Under the chancellor's watch Britain has enjoyed four years of growth, low inflation and employment generation. He has quietly distributed more income to the bottom 10 per cent than any other Labour chancellor, and is set to launch a period of sustained investment in public services unmatched since the war. If Labour can survive a succession of small scandals with its opinion poll lead undented, it is largely due to Mr Brown's stewardship of the economy - which he will seal with his fifth budget on Wednesday. A mark of his success is that the Conservatives now set their policies within his agenda. Gone are Tory promises of across-the-board tax cuts or scaremongering about Labour's tax bombshells. Instead Mr Hague has promised to match Labour's spending plans on health, education, transport and crime trying to emulate Mr Brown's targeted approach to tax cuts. Mr Brown will continue in the same vein on Wednesday. Despite sniping from the IMF, which worries insanely that it is improper for governments to borrow to finance capital investment, the Chancellor has an embarrassment of riches. His surplus this year will match last year's \u00a316 billion, allowing him scope to cut taxes or raise spending by up to \u00a35bn next financial year and still meet his own rules of fiscal probity. He is expected to produce a balanced package, focusing on additional help to children and pensioners while promising a build-up of social investment in Britain's depressed cities and towns. All this will be widely welcomed and will come on top of a substantial \u00a314bn spending programme aimed at children, poorer families and pensioners, based on decisions he took last year. The effects of all this will be felt this this year. Why not use the \u00a35bn to make a real difference by focusing all of it on one or two agenda-setting projects? Here are some suggestions. The Chancellor could commit to reducing class sizes in primary schools to the best in the world (\u00a33bn) while launching a five-year programme of urban regeneration to rebuild Britain's poorest 10 cities (\u00a32bn per annum). Or he could bring forward his ambitions to halve child poverty by 2010 to 2005 (\u00a32.5bn a year) and increase the state pension by \u00a35 a week (\u00a32.5bn a year). Or he could follow the example of America's 120 billionaires and come out strongly in favour of inheritance and capital gains tax, raising sufficient to finance all four spending programmes. We expect the more cautious package - but we would be delighted to be surprised.",

The researchers say the age of onset of female sexual development has not changed for decades.</p> <p>Their intervention challenges several recent research projects which have alleged that increasing numbers of primary school girls are becoming capable of having sex and babies. Half of all girls in this country reach puberty by the age of 10, it has been claimed. Even six-year-olds are developing sexually, it has been said.</p> <p>Factors ranging from environmental pollution to the influence of explicitly sexual TV shows have been blamed for this effect, which has been greeted with horror and alarm by many commentators and education experts.</p> <p>But according to eight senior US endocrinologists, writing in the journal Pediatrics, the phenomenon of early female sexuality is in fact a myth.

      "bodyText": "Claims that the age of puberty is plummeting among girls in Western nations have been challenged by a group of senior US scientists. The researchers say the age of onset of female sexual development has not changed for decades. Their intervention challenges several recent research projects which have alleged that increasing numbers of primary school girls are becoming capable of having sex and babies. Half of all girls in this country reach puberty by the age of 10, it has been claimed. Even six-year-olds are developing sexually, it has been said. Factors ranging from environmental pollution to the influence of explicitly sexual TV shows have been blamed for this effect, which has been greeted with horror and alarm by many commentators and education experts. But according to eight senior US endocrinologists, writing in the journal Pediatrics, the phenomenon of early female sexuality is in fact a myth. 'It is premature to conclude that the normal age of puberty is occurring earlier,' they state. Indeed, the scientists argue that such claims are not only wrong but dangerous. They warn that doctors who examine girls who start developing sexually at six or seven might miss medical problems - such as cancer or genetic disorders which can cause early puberty - if they assume this early onset was normal. 'You don't just dismiss a child in that age range. It is potentially medically dangerous,' said Dr Laura Bachrach, of Stanford University School of Medicine, who recalled a six-year-old who had come to her clinic with pubic hair and severe acne. The girl, she said, 'turned out to have a very large malignant adrenal tumour'. In addition, a report in yesterday's New York Times revealed that two key professional societies in the United States, the Endocrine Society and the Lawson-Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, have both issued public warnings that plunging puberty ages were not an established fact. 'All recognise that the age at the first period, which I think is the most critical event, has not changed, which would suggest to me that the tempo of puberty has not changed,' said endocrinologist Edward Reiter, president of the Lawson-Wilkins society. This point is supported by Dr Russel Viner, an endocrinologist at Great Ormond Street hospital, in London. 'The average age for the onset of puberty in girls is still between 10 and 11, when the first bodily changes start occurring, while menstruation begins at 13,' he told The Observer . 'Those ages have come down dramatically since the turn of the century, when menstruation began at around 17, and the main cause for that drop was probably improved nutrition.' However, since the Sixties official figures have remained more or less stable, and there is not yet any solid medical evidence that more children are hitting early puberty, he added. 'However, we're hearing a lot more stories of girls starting their periods in junior school. There's certainly a rise in concern among teachers and parents.' Such worries were given solid support in 1997 when Dr Marcia Herman-Geddes, of the University of North Carolina, published data which suggested it was now normal to see the first signs of puberty in girls as young as six. And a Children Of The Nineties study in Bristol last year found one in six eight-year-old girls were reaching puberty. Until these studies were published, textbooks had indicated that girls who developed sexually before the age of eight should be subject to medical investigation. In the wake of the new findings, doctors began to argue that sexual development in six and seven years should now be seen as normal. Reiter said he now worried paediatricians were taking the age of six as 'a magic number' for the onset of sexual development. These girls 'need to be individually monitored, individually followed' he said, adding that doctors 'should not be saying: \"Don't worry about it. It's normal\".'",

On the same day, less than 20 miles away in rural Shropshire, 63 Premiership wannabes, parading in freezing conditions, were fighting for the right to earn a living in the game - having been rejected by their clubs. </p> <p>Young men with the same dreams and ambitions as David Beckham, Sol Campbell and Michael Owen lined up in front of scouts from more than 40 foot ball clubs from Britain - and abroad - to prove they are worth another chance. This was last chance saloon at Lilleshall. </p> <p>The players were all coming to the end of their scholarships with Premiership clubs but had been told that they were not going to be retained next season. Some of the kids looked in better order than others. Understandably. While some had been warned some weeks ago that they were not going to be kept on, others assembled here had only just found out in the past few days. Tears had been shed and cats kicked. Everything they had imagined and dreamt about in the game was now on the line. </p> <p>Two Liverpool boys stood out. Both have worn England's colours as schoolboys or youths and must have thought they were on the way. Goalkeeper Peter Crookes, just 18, is a former schoolboy international and has played for the under-19s and reserves at the club under the scrutiny of coach Joe Corrigan. 'It was not about feeling rejected,' he insisted. 'At first it was more, \"What am I going to do next?\" I talked to the coaches here and they made me realise that this is a step sideways to go forward.' </p> <p>While ambitions remain as strong as ever to play at the top, there is an acceptance about their situations. And more realism among this current group about their chances of making it as a first-team player than in the past. </p> <p>Crookes's club-mate, eight-cap England youth international midfielder Stephen Torpey, said: 'Liverpool are a big club. They can go out and buy international players. I'm disappointed it didn't happen for me. Maybe it was not the right time. Hopefully they will pick me up farther down the line.' So many others hang on to the same hope. </p> <p>The 'exit trial' brainwave at Lilleshall's National Sports Centre, a radical move in dealing with under-19s released by top clubs, comes from Dave Richardson, director of youth for the Premier League. Richardson said: 'Being released, they are invariably low. They have had success all their life as a top school or county player. Now there has been a dip but this gives them another opportunity.' </p> <p>This trial may conjure up images of a cattle market, but the aim is to produce a system that is more humane and dignified than before, to move away from the old days and ways. Years ago, it was not uncommon for players to stand outside the manager's office at the end of of the season waiting to hear his verdict. Many would depart a minute later having been told: 'Sorry son, we are not keeping you for next season. All the best and - on your way out - send the next one in.' </p> <p>You could always tell the ones who had not made it as they walked away.

      "bodyText": "Last Wednesday, 18 of the nation's finest footballers played at the highest level of the game in Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's opening 3-0 England win over Spain at Villa Park. On the same day, less than 20 miles away in rural Shropshire, 63 Premiership wannabes, parading in freezing conditions, were fighting for the right to earn a living in the game - having been rejected by their clubs. Young men with the same dreams and ambitions as David Beckham, Sol Campbell and Michael Owen lined up in front of scouts from more than 40 foot ball clubs from Britain - and abroad - to prove they are worth another chance. This was last chance saloon at Lilleshall. The players were all coming to the end of their scholarships with Premiership clubs but had been told that they were not going to be retained next season. Some of the kids looked in better order than others. Understandably. While some had been warned some weeks ago that they were not going to be kept on, others assembled here had only just found out in the past few days. Tears had been shed and cats kicked. Everything they had imagined and dreamt about in the game was now on the line. Two Liverpool boys stood out. Both have worn England's colours as schoolboys or youths and must have thought they were on the way. Goalkeeper Peter Crookes, just 18, is a former schoolboy international and has played for the under-19s and reserves at the club under the scrutiny of coach Joe Corrigan. 'It was not about feeling rejected,' he insisted. 'At first it was more, \"What am I going to do next?\" I talked to the coaches here and they made me realise that this is a step sideways to go forward.' While ambitions remain as strong as ever to play at the top, there is an acceptance about their situations. And more realism among this current group about their chances of making it as a first-team player than in the past. Crookes's club-mate, eight-cap England youth international midfielder Stephen Torpey, said: 'Liverpool are a big club. They can go out and buy international players. I'm disappointed it didn't happen for me. Maybe it was not the right time. Hopefully they will pick me up farther down the line.' So many others hang on to the same hope. The 'exit trial' brainwave at Lilleshall's National Sports Centre, a radical move in dealing with under-19s released by top clubs, comes from Dave Richardson, director of youth for the Premier League. Richardson said: 'Being released, they are invariably low. They have had success all their life as a top school or county player. Now there has been a dip but this gives them another opportunity.' This trial may conjure up images of a cattle market, but the aim is to produce a system that is more humane and dignified than before, to move away from the old days and ways. Years ago, it was not uncommon for players to stand outside the manager's office at the end of of the season waiting to hear his verdict. Many would depart a minute later having been told: 'Sorry son, we are not keeping you for next season. All the best and - on your way out - send the next one in.' You could always tell the ones who had not made it as they walked away. Forlorn figures with their boots under their arms wondering how to tell their family and friends their news of rejection. Richardson has the players together for three days to assure them that there is life after rejection and an abundance of opportunities await. For the first two days, the players divide into individual sides and are coached by former managers and coaches with League experience, attempting to prepare them for D-day - Wednesday - and the trial games. Throughout they have to be aware of each player's emotional state. One coach, the former Halifax manager Mark Lillis, said: 'Some players only found out last week that they had not been kept on.

      "body": "<p>In the annals of rock'n'roll he is not as well-known as Little Richard or Chuck Berry but Johnnie Johnson may be about to get his dues. </p> <p>Later this month, the 76-year-old boogie-woogie pianist behind songs such as 'Maybelline', 'Carol' and 'Sweet Little Sixteen' will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. </p> <p>He will be presented with the honour by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, who has played no small part in rediscovering the man who for more than 30 years was Berry's writing partner and was the inspiration for 'Johnny B Goode'. </p> <p>But Johnson never received credit or writing royalties and has lived most of his life in poverty. Now he is to challenge Berry's contention that he was only a supporting player. He has filed a lawsuit against Berry seeking co-authorship of more than 50 songs. </p> <p>The complaint, which seeks unspecified damages, alleges that Berry took advantage of Johnson's alcoholism and lack of business acumen. '[Johnson] was unable to appreciate the value of his contribution,' says his lawyer Mitch Margo. 'Berry misled him into believing he was only entitled to a studio musician's fee.' If he wins the case Johnson will be entitled to half the royalties from the songs. </p> <p>Berry's supporters say this is an attempt to rewrite history. 'Mr Berry knows there's no basis in fact for this suit and is disappointed that it has been filed,' says Berry's attorney, Joe Jacobson. </p> <p>As far as Johnson is concerned, his argument with Berry is not about money but recognition. 'Money has its value but I'm not a money fanatic,' he said in New York on tour last week. 'Back in the Fifties only the artist's name got on the record. At the time it didn't bother me, I was just happy to be playing. </p> <p>'The lawsuit is just to set the record straight. Chuck's been getting credit for more than what he did. Take the song 'Wee Wee Hours'. That was my song and my lyrics but he took the credit for it.' </p> <p>Berry was an unseasoned player when he joined Johnson's group, the Sir John Trio, in late 1952. Berry adapted Johnson's self-taught hillbilly style to his guitar and emerged as frontman of the renamed Chuck Berry Trio. Johnson collaborated with Berry on more than 100 songs but by the Seventies the pair had all but ceased working together and the pianist was trapped in a world of menial jobs and alcoholism. </p> <p>Before he died in 1985, Stones pianist Ian Stewart asked Keith Richards to find Johnson and help him out. Richards, who found Johnson working in a St Louis steel works, says the first thing he noticed was his thick fingers. 'Like sausages,' Richards says. 'But of course, it's what they do with the keys that clinches the deal.' </p> <p>Richards's patronage rekindled interest in Johnson but he couldn't sustain a comeback. In 1990 he collapsed while playing with Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall. 'I was getting up with a drink and going to bed with a drink,' Johnson says. 'When I had that scare in London I stopped it all cold turkey. I haven't had a drink since.' </p> <p>Three years later Johnson was hired by George Turek, a Houston-based medical services magnate, to play at his wedding. Although Turek thought he was hiring Jimmy Johnson, a Chicago blues guitarist, the pair became friends and Turek began a campaign to win him his place in music history. Turek says : 'When you really listen to Berry's music it's really Johnnie Johnson's music. He gave it that pounding beat.' </p> <p>Turek says Johnson never understood that because he wrote the music, he was entitled to half the songwriting credits. 'In many ways he's very simplistic. He was under the impression that because he did not have the ability to write the notes down on paper he didn't really write it and couldn't take credit for it.' </p> <p>Turek's second battle was to get Johnson recognised by the Hall of Fame. A long campaign supported by Richards and Clapton, as well as Little Richard, Etta James and Bo Diddley, ensued. Last year the organisation created a 'Sideman' category to recognise pioneers who were not stars in their own right. </p> <p>Johnson says he will be honoured to receive the citation on 19 March. 'I love playing music. My fingers may no longer be as fast as I'd like them to be but I still get by. The more I play the more I enjoy it.' And he adds philosophically: 'I guess it's who you know and not what you know that gets you ahead.'</p>",

Kalparanjan Chakma, the Bangladeshi government minister leading the negotiations, said they have been able to establish contact with the kidnappers. A tribal mediator was reported to have met the abductors in their forest hideout in Rangamati, a south-eastern region of hills and dense forests. The three were snatched as they worked on a road project. The bandits placed a \u00a31.1 million ransom on their heads. Earlier, Selby's brother Jon expressed fears that the authorities were planning military action. He said: 'Military action scares us a great deal, I'm afraid.' OAP runs over wife twice A woman, aged 78, was seriously ill in hospital in Slough, Berkshire, after her husband, 84, twice drove over her by accident. He had been reversing his car in a shopping centre car park when his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator. He was treated for shock. Bygraves's old Rolls on sale The 1982 Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit which Max Bygraves, above, used for 14 years has gone on sale in Weymouth with an asking price of \u00a312,000. Bygraves, 78, sold it five years ago and the garage hopes the connection will add to its value. Custody cry A dozen men demonstrated outside the house of High Court Judge Christopher Tyrer yesterday. They claim the divorce system discriminates against men, with custody of children going to women in nine cases out of 10. Dome auction raises \u00a33.5m The auction of items from the Millennium Dome raised nearly \u00a33.5 million. The last-minute withdrawal of more than 1,000 items dented the original estimate of \u00a35m. Train murder A murder inquiry has been opened after a man aged 21 died after a fight on board a train from Newcastle to Manchester early yesterday. He was found at the foot of an embankment in Durham and was pronounced dead in hospital. Happy return Stephen Downing today celebrates his 45th birthday with his family, his first as a free man since being wrongly jailed for murder 27 years ago in Bakewell, Derbyshire. He is due to start work at a local hotel.

First, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the Socialist candidate for next year's presidential election, has taken the lead over his rival Chirac in the opinion polls. Second, it has enabled Delano\u00eb to present himself as a new broom, who will sweep out all corruption from the H\u0000circ;tel de Ville.</p> <p>Transparency, in fact, is his most prominent policy plank. 'For 24 years, there has been a system with fictitious jobs and phoney electors,' Delano\u00eb says. 'I've been fighting against this system.

A burly man with a rich baritone voice, S\u00e9guin at least had the advantage of being well-known compared with his Socialist rival.</p> <p>But, embarrassingly for the Gaullists, Tiberi is standing for re-election on an independent ticket, bitterly moaning that S\u00e9guin has stolen his best ideas on crime and security - two of the top campaign issues here, along with pollution and transport. Though Tiberi is the true wet firework in the campaign, his candidacy is likely to split the right-wing vote, making Delano\u00eb's chances of election stronger.</p> <p>What kind of man is Delano\u00eb? On Thursday night, he appeared before 3,500 party faithful in the north of Paris in his last rally before polling day. It should have been a triumphant evening. There were messages of support from Ken Livingstone, as well as the mayors of Geneva, Barcelona, S\u00e3o Paulo and Vienna. But Delano\u00eb hardly milked this crowd, telling his workers instead that they must not be deflected from their campaign. He has had something of a charisma by-pass. True, he may have led 100,000 through Paris last year in a Gay Pride march, but Delano\u00eb is more grey than gay.</p> <p>He came out only two years ago, a move greeted by Gallic shrugs rather than Anglo-Saxon hysteria. Sophisticated Parisians may well vote for Delano\u00eb because he is gay rather than despite it.</p> <p>In profile he has a long ski-jump of a nose that recalls Bob Hope's, but otherwise there is nothing funny about Bertrand Delano\u00eb. He is close to Jospin and is of the same austere, intellectual stamp. Just as the biggest slur against Jospin in France is that he is too upstandingly Protestant to have a mistress, so Delano\u00eb hardly has a flamboyantly public sexual persona.</p> <p>Born in 1950 in Tunis (also S\u00e9guin's birthplace), he studied in Rodez and Toulouse, before working his way up through the Socialist Party machine. He was first elected a Paris councillor in 1977 - the same year Chirac became mayor - and quickly became a leading member of the '18th arrondissement gang' with Jospin and current Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant, still close confidants. In 1999, after years of blameless municipal service, he wrote For The Honour of Paris, a book that set out his anti-cronyist message for the city. His policies are sensible. Delano\u00eb calls for better policing, more green spaces, fewer cars and better public transport, and more council provision of cr\u00e8che spaces.</p> <p>He has been dubbed le Renard de Marais (the Fox of the Marais, the fashionable gay and Jewish quarter of central Paris), and indeed the cunning modesty of his proposals has caught the imagination of Parisians. Here, many electors think, is a man they can trust - or at least trust not to fill his party's coffers with public money, or set his family up in luxury apartments at the city's expense.</p> <p>This month's French municipal contests will give a strong indication of the outcome of next year's presidential election. According to Lib\u00e9ration: 'It is the twilight of the Chirac system. Will Jacques Chirac lose the presidency in these municipal elections?' If he does, the man who brings him down will be Bertrand Delano\u00eb.</p>",

In an attempt to steal Delano\u00eb's thunder, though, the RPR selected former party chairman Philippe S\u00e9guin as its candidate. A burly man with a rich baritone voice, S\u00e9guin at least had the advantage of being well-known compared with his Socialist rival. But, embarrassingly for the Gaullists, Tiberi is standing for re-election on an independent ticket, bitterly moaning that S\u00e9guin has stolen his best ideas on crime and security - two of the top campaign issues here, along with pollution and transport. Though Tiberi is the true wet firework in the campaign, his candidacy is likely to split the right-wing vote, making Delano\u00eb's chances of election stronger. What kind of man is Delano\u00eb? On Thursday night, he appeared before 3,500 party faithful in the north of Paris in his last rally before polling day. It should have been a triumphant evening. There were messages of support from Ken Livingstone, as well as the mayors of Geneva, Barcelona, S\u00e3o Paulo and Vienna. But Delano\u00eb hardly milked this crowd, telling his workers instead that they must not be deflected from their campaign. He has had something of a charisma by-pass. True, he may have led 100,000 through Paris last year in a Gay Pride march, but Delano\u00eb is more grey than gay. He came out only two years ago, a move greeted by Gallic shrugs rather than Anglo-Saxon hysteria. Sophisticated Parisians may well vote for Delano\u00eb because he is gay rather than despite it. In profile he has a long ski-jump of a nose that recalls Bob Hope's, but otherwise there is nothing funny about Bertrand Delano\u00eb. He is close to Jospin and is of the same austere, intellectual stamp. Just as the biggest slur against Jospin in France is that he is too upstandingly Protestant to have a mistress, so Delano\u00eb hardly has a flamboyantly public sexual persona. Born in 1950 in Tunis (also S\u00e9guin's birthplace), he studied in Rodez and Toulouse, before working his way up through the Socialist Party machine. He was first elected a Paris councillor in 1977 - the same year Chirac became mayor - and quickly became a leading member of the '18th arrondissement gang' with Jospin and current Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant, still close confidants. In 1999, after years of blameless municipal service, he wrote For The Honour of Paris, a book that set out his anti-cronyist message for the city. His policies are sensible. Delano\u00eb calls for better policing, more green spaces, fewer cars and better public transport, and more council provision of cr\u00e8che spaces. He has been dubbed le Renard de Marais (the Fox of the Marais, the fashionable gay and Jewish quarter of central Paris), and indeed the cunning modesty of his proposals has caught the imagination of Parisians. Here, many electors think, is a man they can trust - or at least trust not to fill his party's coffers with public money, or set his family up in luxury apartments at the city's expense. This month's French municipal contests will give a strong indication of the outcome of next year's presidential election. According to Lib\u00e9ration: 'It is the twilight of the Chirac system. Will Jacques Chirac lose the presidency in these municipal elections?' If he does, the man who brings him down will be Bertrand Delano\u00eb.",

Hussain was more circumspect but by the end of his innings of 73 he was timing the ball sweetly, albeit in benign conditions and against very undemanding, unMurali-type spinners. The target of 249 was always a canter for England, who finished the day far happier than they started it. Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe had a gentle net at the end.

      "bodyText": "On paper, this should have been a difficult match against another of the division's better sides. In practice, the only real doubt was whether Blackburn would score and win, or not and draw. In the end Marcus Bent's simple strike ensured the former. For Graeme Souness's side this was an eleventh win in 16 games and cemented the belief around these parts that Rovers are soon to return to the top flight. They have certainly left themselves in a position to do so, although today they will seek some assistance from an unlikely source. After spending the whole season cursing their incessant success and waiting in desperation for signs of weakness, Blackburn will be desperate for Fulham to win today. Should Bolton lose at Craven Cottage then Rovers, with two games in hand, would be ready to pounce on the second promotion spot. It took Blackburn just 49 seconds to fashion their first chance, only for Damien Duff to shoot weakly at Russell Hoult. Within minutes, Duff combined with Eyal Berkovic to set up first Matt Jansen, then David Dunn, and it seemed that victory would be secured without undue duress. But the visitors gradually came into the game, and it was the home fans who fell quiet first. West Brom have promotion hopes of their own, having occupied a play-off position for most of the season. But their cause here was not helped by suspensions to Neil Clement, who missed his first game of the season, and top-scorer Lee Hughes.

      "body": "<p>The teenager looked the prison governor in the eye. Jailed for a series of petty crimes, he was due to be released the following day. But he was not a reformed character. Nor was he scared of the governor.</p> <p>'I get out tomorrow,' the youth calmly informed Danny McAllister, who took charge of the Brinsford Young Offenders' Institution, regarded as the most violent jail in Britain, last April. 'Before I go,' the inmate added, 'I'm going to smash up my cell. And there's nothing you can do.'</p> <p>McAllister told the story last week to illustrate his extreme frustration. 'This young man went off and did just what he said he would. And he was right: there was nothing I could do.'</p> <p>Last week McAllister was praised for his attempts to turn Brinsford around in an otherwise damning report from Chief Inspector of Prisons Sir David Ramsbotham. But he admits he is swimming against a tide of drug-fuelled violence and the total breakdown of respect for authority. 'We are not dealing with a cross-section of society here,' Ramsbotham said. 'This is a distillation of young men in crisis who have been failed by family, schools and the community. It is very strong stuff.'</p> <p>Three further horrifying reports into young offender institutions (YOIs) are due to be released shortly. They demonstrate what senior members of the prison inspectorate are now beginning to call 'a culture of penal pessimism', with little hope for the young men described in the Brinsford report as 'the detritus of long-standing social exclusion'.</p> <p>The reports focus on:</p> <p>\u0095 Stoke Heath, Shropshire: It is alleged the now suspended governor had allowed a regime of bullying to develop. When inspectors examined records they were 'horrified' to discover more than 1,000 assaults in a year.</p> <p>\u0095 Feltham 'B': The over-18s wing of the prison described by Ramsbotham as 'rotten to the core' is branded as 'still appalling'. Older prisoners have been neglected while improvements have been made for juveniles .</p> <p>\u0095 Portland: Inspectors have discovered little improvement at the Hampshire institution renowned for its 'militaristic' regime. Police are investigating 35 cases of alleged assault by officers.</p> <p>Director of the Prison Service Martin Narey last week brushed aside Ramsbotham's calls for root-and-branch reform of YOIs.</p> <p>The Chief Inspector has called for the closure of the worst YOIs and the appointment of a single senior figure to take responsibility for young offenders. Narey has said changes in management at Brinsford and other YOIs have already brought about considerable improvements.</p> <p>But senior figures within the prison inspectorate have warned Narey not to ignore the growing crisis that has afflicted the system since the abolition of the Borstal system in 1980. Some, it is believed, are urging a return to the public school-based Borstal model of self-improvement for young prisoners.</p> <p>McAllister, like many of his colleagues, blames the Government's new detention and training orders (DTOs) for the staggering rise in the assault rate among juvenile offenders. The new sentences, in which the offenders automatically spend half their sentence in prison and half in the community, prohibit staff from adding extra days as a punishment. McAllister believes that this has led to a collapse in discipline.</p> <p>'It always used to be the case that prisoners became better behaved towards the end of their sentence. With these new sentences it is the complete opposite.' He points to a graph showing the sharp rise in assaults since inmates on DTOs were introduced to the prison last May. In April there were five assaults by juvenile prisoners; a month later the number had more than quadrupled to 23 and has remained high ever since. In 10 months, there have been more than 200 assaults.</p> <p>McAllister claims there is a 'gentler feel about the jail' since he took over, but he remains fatalistic about the endemic violence: 'When you get 500 young men in a school or an army barracks or a prison you get bullying. It's the human condition.'</p> <p>When Ramsbotham visited Brinsford, a 500-inmate, modern, red-brick warehouse just outside Wolverhampton, last June he described the level of neglect as 'breathtaking'. His report was finally released by the Home Office last week after an eight-month delay. Ramsbotham said it was one of the most disturbing inspections he had ever carried out and led him to coin a chilling phrase for the practice of YOIs such as Brinsford - 'institutionalised child abuse'.</p> <p>At Brinsford, staff and inmates alike agreed that detention and training orders were making the prison unmanageable. While the number of hours prisoners spend in 'purposeful activity' such as education or sport has increased by 58 per cent, teachers working at the prison said this had been matched by a similar rise in violent behaviour among the younger inmates, who had developed a 'big, bad gangster culture'. Art teacher Mark Johnson said he had been threatened with violence on several occasions: 'In the run-up to release, the juveniles refuse to do any work and it just disrupts everything you try to do.'</p> <p>The four students working at clay models in Johnson's classroom can't be named for legal reasons, but they all agreed that Brinsford was a 'stitch-up' jail, where prisoners spent little or no time outside their cells. 'I heard about this place before I came here,' said one wide-eyed 16-year-old. 'I heard that it was bad but it is really horrible. Everything that the papers have been saying about this place is true.'</p> <p>Martyn Carless and Andrew Doyle, both 19, said that heroin and crack cocaine were at the heart of the prison's bullying problem. 'The heroin addicts come in here and they start to cold- turkey and that makes them easy to pick on,' says Doyle. 'And then they can't afford to pay for tobacco, and that's when they get into real trouble.' Around a fifth of the inmates of Brinsford test positive for drugs.</p> <p>Carless and Doyle, who have been in Brinsford six and seven times respectively, said that crime was the only way they knew to make money and the same went for most of the people they knew. 'You see the same faces over and over again,' said Carless. 'One day they've been released and the next day they're back in here again.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, the assaults go on. In the segregation unit, renamed the Intervention Assessment Unit by the new governor, 19-year-old John Davies is being held as a punishment for attacking a guard. He says he 'lost it' after he was refused permission to go to the library with other prisoners. Davies, who has to wear a special blue and yellow uniform after he escaped from Portland YOI, claims he was grabbed by the throat by a prison officer and set upon by three others. His complaint is under investigation by local police. 'I don't want to be here,' says Davies. 'I just keep on getting into trouble.'</p> <p>Local MP Sir Patrick Cormack, who was visiting the prison at the same time as The Observer, said he had demanded a meeting with Prisons Minister Paul Boateng to discuss the problem of young offenders and, in particular, detention and training orders. 'I am deeply impressed by the present governor at Brinsford. But the problem is with the system itself. Ministers have to stop ignoring what Sir David Ramsbotham is saying.'</p> <p>Harry Fletcher of probation union Napo said: 'The Home Secretary and the head of the Prison Service need to recognise that there has been 20 years of neglect, underfunding and lack of vision.'</p> <p>Danny McAllister is already making a difference at the jail: anti-bullying and anti-racist strategies have been introduced and work with addicts has led to a fall in positive drug tests. But he says he is concerned that Britain was creating a hardened criminal class on the American model by locking up increasing numbers of young people. 'It is important to remember that most young men stop offending by the age of 25. In California they spend more money on prisons than education. As a citizen I think that is wrong. Society has a right to be protected from having their car stolen or being assaulted, but we also have a duty to these young men.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.bright@observer.co.uk\">martin.bright@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The teenager looked the prison governor in the eye. Jailed for a series of petty crimes, he was due to be released the following day. But he was not a reformed character. Nor was he scared of the governor. 'I get out tomorrow,' the youth calmly informed Danny McAllister, who took charge of the Brinsford Young Offenders' Institution, regarded as the most violent jail in Britain, last April. 'Before I go,' the inmate added, 'I'm going to smash up my cell. And there's nothing you can do.' McAllister told the story last week to illustrate his extreme frustration. 'This young man went off and did just what he said he would. And he was right: there was nothing I could do.' Last week McAllister was praised for his attempts to turn Brinsford around in an otherwise damning report from Chief Inspector of Prisons Sir David Ramsbotham. But he admits he is swimming against a tide of drug-fuelled violence and the total breakdown of respect for authority. 'We are not dealing with a cross-section of society here,' Ramsbotham said. 'This is a distillation of young men in crisis who have been failed by family, schools and the community. It is very strong stuff.' Three further horrifying reports into young offender institutions (YOIs) are due to be released shortly. They demonstrate what senior members of the prison inspectorate are now beginning to call 'a culture of penal pessimism', with little hope for the young men described in the Brinsford report as 'the detritus of long-standing social exclusion'. The reports focus on: \u0095 Stoke Heath, Shropshire: It is alleged the now suspended governor had allowed a regime of bullying to develop. When inspectors examined records they were 'horrified' to discover more than 1,000 assaults in a year. \u0095 Feltham 'B': The over-18s wing of the prison described by Ramsbotham as 'rotten to the core' is branded as 'still appalling'. Older prisoners have been neglected while improvements have been made for juveniles . \u0095 Portland: Inspectors have discovered little improvement at the Hampshire institution renowned for its 'militaristic' regime. Police are investigating 35 cases of alleged assault by officers. Director of the Prison Service Martin Narey last week brushed aside Ramsbotham's calls for root-and-branch reform of YOIs. The Chief Inspector has called for the closure of the worst YOIs and the appointment of a single senior figure to take responsibility for young offenders. Narey has said changes in management at Brinsford and other YOIs have already brought about considerable improvements. But senior figures within the prison inspectorate have warned Narey not to ignore the growing crisis that has afflicted the system since the abolition of the Borstal system in 1980. Some, it is believed, are urging a return to the public school-based Borstal model of self-improvement for young prisoners. McAllister, like many of his colleagues, blames the Government's new detention and training orders (DTOs) for the staggering rise in the assault rate among juvenile offenders. The new sentences, in which the offenders automatically spend half their sentence in prison and half in the community, prohibit staff from adding extra days as a punishment. McAllister believes that this has led to a collapse in discipline. 'It always used to be the case that prisoners became better behaved towards the end of their sentence. With these new sentences it is the complete opposite.' He points to a graph showing the sharp rise in assaults since inmates on DTOs were introduced to the prison last May. In April there were five assaults by juvenile prisoners; a month later the number had more than quadrupled to 23 and has remained high ever since. In 10 months, there have been more than 200 assaults. McAllister claims there is a 'gentler feel about the jail' since he took over, but he remains fatalistic about the endemic violence: 'When you get 500 young men in a school or an army barracks or a prison you get bullying. It's the human condition.' When Ramsbotham visited Brinsford, a 500-inmate, modern, red-brick warehouse just outside Wolverhampton, last June he described the level of neglect as 'breathtaking'. His report was finally released by the Home Office last week after an eight-month delay. Ramsbotham said it was one of the most disturbing inspections he had ever carried out and led him to coin a chilling phrase for the practice of YOIs such as Brinsford - 'institutionalised child abuse'. At Brinsford, staff and inmates alike agreed that detention and training orders were making the prison unmanageable. While the number of hours prisoners spend in 'purposeful activity' such as education or sport has increased by 58 per cent, teachers working at the prison said this had been matched by a similar rise in violent behaviour among the younger inmates, who had developed a 'big, bad gangster culture'. Art teacher Mark Johnson said he had been threatened with violence on several occasions: 'In the run-up to release, the juveniles refuse to do any work and it just disrupts everything you try to do.' The four students working at clay models in Johnson's classroom can't be named for legal reasons, but they all agreed that Brinsford was a 'stitch-up' jail, where prisoners spent little or no time outside their cells. 'I heard about this place before I came here,' said one wide-eyed 16-year-old. 'I heard that it was bad but it is really horrible. Everything that the papers have been saying about this place is true.' Martyn Carless and Andrew Doyle, both 19, said that heroin and crack cocaine were at the heart of the prison's bullying problem. 'The heroin addicts come in here and they start to cold- turkey and that makes them easy to pick on,' says Doyle. 'And then they can't afford to pay for tobacco, and that's when they get into real trouble.' Around a fifth of the inmates of Brinsford test positive for drugs. Carless and Doyle, who have been in Brinsford six and seven times respectively, said that crime was the only way they knew to make money and the same went for most of the people they knew. 'You see the same faces over and over again,' said Carless. 'One day they've been released and the next day they're back in here again.' Meanwhile, the assaults go on. In the segregation unit, renamed the Intervention Assessment Unit by the new governor, 19-year-old John Davies is being held as a punishment for attacking a guard. He says he 'lost it' after he was refused permission to go to the library with other prisoners. Davies, who has to wear a special blue and yellow uniform after he escaped from Portland YOI, claims he was grabbed by the throat by a prison officer and set upon by three others. His complaint is under investigation by local police. 'I don't want to be here,' says Davies. 'I just keep on getting into trouble.' Local MP Sir Patrick Cormack, who was visiting the prison at the same time as The Observer, said he had demanded a meeting with Prisons Minister Paul Boateng to discuss the problem of young offenders and, in particular, detention and training orders. 'I am deeply impressed by the present governor at Brinsford. But the problem is with the system itself. Ministers have to stop ignoring what Sir David Ramsbotham is saying.' Harry Fletcher of probation union Napo said: 'The Home Secretary and the head of the Prison Service need to recognise that there has been 20 years of neglect, underfunding and lack of vision.' Danny McAllister is already making a difference at the jail: anti-bullying and anti-racist strategies have been introduced and work with addicts has led to a fall in positive drug tests. But he says he is concerned that Britain was creating a hardened criminal class on the American model by locking up increasing numbers of young people. 'It is important to remember that most young men stop offending by the age of 25. In California they spend more money on prisons than education. As a citizen I think that is wrong. Society has a right to be protected from having their car stolen or being assaulted, but we also have a duty to these young men.' martin.bright@observer.co.uk",

It is now up to the judge in Birmingham to send the twins back.</p> <p>'The likelihood is that they will return to the US,' said Deborah Cullen, an adoption lawyer and legal spokesperson for British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering. 'Unless there is some subtle argument for the the Kilshaws being granted custody, Birmingham High Court will hear the case within weeks and you could see them move to the US within a month.'</p> <p>Judith Kilshaw admitted yesterday that she and her husband were not going to win the Birmingham court case, the next hearing of which is scheduled for 19 March, adding that the decision had, in her opinion, already been taken against them at 'higher levels'.</p> <p>'There's a political agenda' she said. 'If I won, it would say that it is all right to adopt from the US.</p> <p>'I wouldn't call [the latest] US court decision a judgment - it's more a request. I think the twins should be sent back to Arkansas - that's where the paperwork and the judges are. I don't want them to go back to Tranda [Wecker, their birth mother]. [She made] allegations that I smell. I put perfume on and we bathe like normal people.'</p> <p>The likelihood of yet another move for the twins will anger campaigners who believe that their repeated moving between foster parents and social services has unnecessarily added to the disruption the eight-month-old girls have experienced. The twins could leave the care of British social services, to be passed to another temporary foster family in the US, before being found a final foster home.</p> <p>This would give the girls five sets of foster parents in a matter of months.</p> <p>Recriminations and controversy continue to surround the battle for the twins. Judith Kilshaw claimed that Tina Johnson, who sold the girls to both the Kilshaws and another couple in California - Richard and Vicky Allen - through her internet adoption agency, was now being offered film and book deals for her story.</p> <p>Richard Allen has subsequently been charged with sexually abusing two other girls.

      "bodyText": "The custody battle for the twins at the heart of the internet adoption scandal was mired in new controversy last night when it emerged that they could be sent back to authorities in the US within weeks. Legal experts believe that continued court battles in the US will force British authorities to pass judgment on the twins' case within weeks, handing them to American officials 'within a month'. The Welsh couple Alan and Judith Kilshaw, who claim they rightfully bought the twins from an American internet adoption agency, await the judgment of Birmingham High Court over their application to become the twins' guardians. But last week a court in St Louis, Missouri, ruled that the twins should be returned to the country of their birth where two court battles - in Arkansas and Missouri - over their adoption are continuing. It is now up to the judge in Birmingham to send the twins back. 'The likelihood is that they will return to the US,' said Deborah Cullen, an adoption lawyer and legal spokesperson for British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering. 'Unless there is some subtle argument for the the Kilshaws being granted custody, Birmingham High Court will hear the case within weeks and you could see them move to the US within a month.' Judith Kilshaw admitted yesterday that she and her husband were not going to win the Birmingham court case, the next hearing of which is scheduled for 19 March, adding that the decision had, in her opinion, already been taken against them at 'higher levels'. 'There's a political agenda' she said. 'If I won, it would say that it is all right to adopt from the US. 'I wouldn't call [the latest] US court decision a judgment - it's more a request. I think the twins should be sent back to Arkansas - that's where the paperwork and the judges are. I don't want them to go back to Tranda [Wecker, their birth mother]. [She made] allegations that I smell. I put perfume on and we bathe like normal people.' The likelihood of yet another move for the twins will anger campaigners who believe that their repeated moving between foster parents and social services has unnecessarily added to the disruption the eight-month-old girls have experienced. The twins could leave the care of British social services, to be passed to another temporary foster family in the US, before being found a final foster home. This would give the girls five sets of foster parents in a matter of months. Recriminations and controversy continue to surround the battle for the twins. Judith Kilshaw claimed that Tina Johnson, who sold the girls to both the Kilshaws and another couple in California - Richard and Vicky Allen - through her internet adoption agency, was now being offered film and book deals for her story. Richard Allen has subsequently been charged with sexually abusing two other girls. He denies the charges. nick.walsh@observer.co.uk",

The fact that Alan Shearer was out of action for half that time did nothing to lessen his displeasure when going down under the penalty-box challenge of his rival captain David Weir. The referee, David Elleray, was equally adamant about his decision not to award a spot kick. </p> <p>Shearer would have been even more aggrieved had Francis Jeffers done justice to the through pass from Kevin Campbell, which played him clear of the Newcastle defence a minute later. Jeffers, with plenty of time to steady himself, placed his shot too near Shay Given, who saved with his legs. </p> <p>It was the start of a rotten first half for Everton, who wasted other chances and had two players carried off. The first was Gary Naysmith who seemed to be caught by Andrew Griffin after pulling the ball back from the baseline to Campbell, who knocked a golden opportunity wide of the far post. </p> <p>In first-half stoppage time Alex Nyarko went down awkwardly and was also replaced immediately. David Unsworth and Idan Tal were the two men introduced, with Walter Smith reluctant at this stage to bring on Paul Gascoigne, back in the squad for the first time since early November after surgery. </p> <p>Campbell was unable to make use of a more difficult chance which Weir created by hoisting a long ball into the box. Campbell made contact with his head but could only direct the ball straight at Shay Given. There was another vigorous protest, this time from Scot Gemmill who claimed that his volley was deflected behind by the hand of a Newcastle defender. Nothing doing, ruled Elleray again. </p> <p>Shearer rose well to test Paul Gerrard with a header from Nolberto Solano's cross, and shortly before Nyarko's departure Gerrard was fortunate to see Michael Ball tidy up after his one-handed deflection of a cut-back from Shola Ameobi came loose inside the six-yard box. </p> <p>Newcastle's goal came a minute into the second half. Shearer, chasing what looked like a lost cause, closed down Xavier and when the former England captain's low-angle shot was pushed out by Gerrard the ball struck Unsworth and rebounded into the net. </p> <p>Everton drew level six minutes from time when Unsworth went some way to compensating for his error by converting a penalty after Campbell was fouled by Steve Caldwell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A striker spurned can be an angry animal, particularly if he has not scored for four months. The fact that Alan Shearer was out of action for half that time did nothing to lessen his displeasure when going down under the penalty-box challenge of his rival captain David Weir. The referee, David Elleray, was equally adamant about his decision not to award a spot kick. Shearer would have been even more aggrieved had Francis Jeffers done justice to the through pass from Kevin Campbell, which played him clear of the Newcastle defence a minute later. Jeffers, with plenty of time to steady himself, placed his shot too near Shay Given, who saved with his legs. It was the start of a rotten first half for Everton, who wasted other chances and had two players carried off. The first was Gary Naysmith who seemed to be caught by Andrew Griffin after pulling the ball back from the baseline to Campbell, who knocked a golden opportunity wide of the far post. In first-half stoppage time Alex Nyarko went down awkwardly and was also replaced immediately. David Unsworth and Idan Tal were the two men introduced, with Walter Smith reluctant at this stage to bring on Paul Gascoigne, back in the squad for the first time since early November after surgery. Campbell was unable to make use of a more difficult chance which Weir created by hoisting a long ball into the box. Campbell made contact with his head but could only direct the ball straight at Shay Given. There was another vigorous protest, this time from Scot Gemmill who claimed that his volley was deflected behind by the hand of a Newcastle defender. Nothing doing, ruled Elleray again. Shearer rose well to test Paul Gerrard with a header from Nolberto Solano's cross, and shortly before Nyarko's departure Gerrard was fortunate to see Michael Ball tidy up after his one-handed deflection of a cut-back from Shola Ameobi came loose inside the six-yard box. Newcastle's goal came a minute into the second half. Shearer, chasing what looked like a lost cause, closed down Xavier and when the former England captain's low-angle shot was pushed out by Gerrard the ball struck Unsworth and rebounded into the net. Everton drew level six minutes from time when Unsworth went some way to compensating for his error by converting a penalty after Campbell was fouled by Steve Caldwell.",

It was also a good afternoon for Dundee, who overcame St Johnstone 3-2 with a late goal from Javier Artero. St Johnstone, who went ahead after 13 minutes, then found themselves 2-1 down, appeared to have salvaged a point 12 minutes from the end when Paul Kane converted a penalty. In addition to that late winner by Artero, the other blow for them was that Gary Bollan, scorer of their first goal, was sent off. Dundee player-manager Ivano Bonetti said: 'In recent weeks I have been happy with our performances, especially against Rangers, but the difference is that today we took our chances.' However, St Johnstone's manager, Sandy Clark, insisted: 'Our defensive mistakes were horrendous, we gave the game to them.' Despite Kilmarnock being held to a goalless draw by Aberdeen, their manager, Bobby Williamson, said: 'You always get a good shift from my team, which is all I can ask. 'It was a frustrating game in some ways because there were some great saves from their goalkeeper. But I have to say it was a better performance than our goalless draw last week.'",

The real story is what happens when companies stop being admired. In this case, the company written out of history in 2001 is Lucent Technologies, No 10 last year. Its dramatic humbling shows only too clearly that being admired in the past is no guarantee of success in the future - or even the present. In fact, being most admired should probably be taken as a danger sign; and the longer the successful run lasts, the louder the alarm bells should ring. </p> <p>The fact is that admiration is a truly terrible proxy for success. If you have trouble with that, consider the fate of a British 'most admired' award in the early Nineties, which was apologetically abandoned because the same company was monopolising it every time. </p> <p>The name of the perennial winner? Marks &amp; Spencer. One reason M&amp;S fell from grace was precisely that it was most admired, confirming senior managers in their belief that they were in possession of all the answers, which they could impose from the top. Diametrically wrong. </p> <p>Their strategies and competences just happened to fit the environment of the Eighties. When it changed, they were sunk. </p> <p>As with M&amp;S, companies are admired for embodying the conventional wisdom about what makes for success. Yet today's conventional wisdom is tomorrow's recipe for disaster (just ask any dotcom). By reinforcing that wisdom retrospectively, admiration just makes the mistakes catastrophic when they do break the surface. </p> <p>This is because learning is not about being right, or 'admirable'; it's about being wrong. Not for nothing do we call it trial and error. This is how science advances; this is how infants, children and adults learn; how innovation works. You try lots of things, eliminate the bad ones and keep the good until they too - as they always do in the end - turn bad. </p> <p>But not companies. Despite the hype, the 'learning organisation' is the Loch Ness monster of management: endlessly hunted and fantasised over, but never actually sighted. The reason is simple: Companies don't fail enough. </p> <p>Counterintuitively, being wrong has a lot going for it - if you know how to use it. Think of it this way: Firms exist at the intersection of two basic laws. Revans' Law (after the great management maverick Reg Revans, father of action learning) says that to survive, an organisation must learn at least as fast as its external environment is changing. </p> <p>At the same time, Sturgeon's Law (coined by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon) decrees that 90 per cent of everything is crap (there's no guarantee about the other 10 per cent, by the way). One manifestation of Sturgeon is that nine out of 10 start-ups fail; and in normal times only one or two out of 10 venture-capital investments pays off big-time. </p> <p>More soberly, Soichiro Honda, founder of the Japanese car firm, puts it this way: 'Many people dream of success. To me success can only be achieved through repeated failure and introspection. In fact, success represents the 1 per cent of your work which results only from the 99 per cent that is called failure.' </p> <p>The key is that you can't have one without the other: in management, as in films, novels or poetry, the sublime emerges from, and is partly defined by, the accumulated experience and experiment of the ridiculous. It follows that to amplify the sublime, you also have to increase the volume and incidence of failure. As Tom Peters says: 'We need lots more of it. We need faster failure. It is fair to say that if we can't increase the gross national failure rate, we're in for a very rough ride indeed.' </p> <p>Of course, this kind of failure is not the same as common or garden sloppiness. The point is to learn. For constructive failure of this kind to occur it must, in Peters' formulation, take place 'above the waterline' (that is, it won't sink the firm) and it must be accompanied by 'introspection' and immediate modification of product, processes or behaviour. This is the real definition of knowledge management - managing and learning from error. </p> <p>You don't have to be a student of management to see what happens when it doesn't occur: you just have to travel by rail, look at the state of the British countryside, or spend a day in one of those countless companies where people are managed by the book or driven by fear from the top. </p> <p>In all these organisations, because even small failures are inadmissible, they are hushed up or ignored - or people fiddle the figures. Managers perpetuate the deception to meet their targets; actions based on inaccurate data become policy; not only does no learning take place, but at each stage the deception becomes more institutionalised and harder to address. </p> <p>Finally, at board level, it is simply unacknowledgeable. As researcher Chris Argyris has noted, even though in every case of corporate disaster, managers can clearly see it approaching, no one can break the conspiracy of silence, let alone take action. </p> <p>Thus do multiple unimportant, even benign, failures end up as one huge and exceedingly malign one. This is what happened at IBM and Xerox, and at M&amp;S, which were once among the world's most admired corporations. </p> <p>Could it happen to GE, perhaps the most revered company in history? It could, and almost certainly will, eventually. GE has formidable management strengths. But to go on courting admiration, it must take risks below - not above - the waterline. </p> <p>Thus if absorbing the $45bn bulk of Honeywell goes awry, new chief executive Jeffrey Immelt will not be around to learn from the experience.

      "body": "<p> The work we do and the places we do it in are changing faster than at any time since the industrial revolution. Nobody knows exactly what the long-term effects of this will be, which can make secure career planning difficult. But are we worrying about the wrong questions? If you need to earn a living in the working environment of tomorrow, the key question is not 'how will globalisation and new technology alter it' but 'what skills will I need to survive in it'. </p> <p>That is the question some businesses are beginning to address. The Talent Foundation, for example, which brings together employers as diverse as British Airways, the BBC, the police, the army and Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting), is clear that people, not machines, are the future. </p> <p>'Human skills are the essential foundations for success in the e-economy,' says the Foundation's Kinga Kowalewska. Richard Reeves of the Industrial Society, agrees: 'Corporate headquarters will probably continue to grow over the next 10 years. But another growing group will be the so-called new nomads - freelances with portfolio careers taking their skills from company to company. But whether you go this route or retain the security of a single employer, the skills you'll require are pretty similar.' </p> <p>So what are these skills? Both Reeves and the Talent Foundation pinpoint not so much the technical or vocational as the very, very human - the sort of things computers can't do, in fact. </p> <p>'Relationship management, by people both inside and outside of the company structure, will become key,' says Reeves. </p> <p>He is referring to a form of networking that is about more than just mingling amiably at the office party. 'More and more organisations will be focusing on their core activity and sub-contracting out the rest,' he says. 'This won't just be the office cleaning, but also knowledge-rich types of work such as PR or human resources. </p> <p>'In this environment, the effective worker will be the one with the capacity to retain contact with a wide range of people in a wide range of organisations across a wide range of locations.' </p> <p>He makes a distinction between 'hot' networks, which include people and companies that are going places, and 'cold' ones - which are not. Hot networks constantly refresh themselves as people move in and out. </p> <p>'Technical skills are becoming increasingly disposable,' he says. 'The computer system you're using now will probably be useless in three years. It will be crucial to develop the ability to recognise when your skills are obsolete and have the confidence to move on. In fact, your existing vocational skills are less important than your ability to learn new ones.' </p> <p>Reeves believes that because of this we will increasingly pursue jobs that afford us the opportunity to learn - a need that, according to the Talent Foundation, many employers can't yet meet. </p> <p>'Most organisations would agree that they need people who can learn quickly, who can solve problems without being told to and can come up with creative ideas without waiting for others,' says Kowalewska. </p> <p>'But today's training strategies have a critical blind spot - the learner's motivation to learn. Without appropriate readiness to learn, training investments are destined to fail.' </p> <p>The Foundation's research suggests emotional intelligence and motivational courses to help staff to develop this capacity to learn. </p> <p>'In our study last year, more emotional intelligence participants perceived learning to be fun - 88 per cent compared with 64 per cent in the control group,' says Kowalewska. 'They also had higher self-awareness (62 compared with 43 per cent) and knew what to learn in order to succeed (71 compared with 61 per cent).' </p> <p>She wants to see more of this sort of training: 'Organisations often attribute their loss of competitiveness and innovation to not having the right people,' she says. 'But investment is not insufficiently focused on developing human skills.' </p> <p>So how strong is your readiness to learn? Reeves' advice is to develop your emotional capacity for it. 'Study what you want to study. What you learn may become out of date or irrelevant, but the capacity to learn and the desire to do it will not. If you like history, study it. Learning for learning's sake is the new modern thinking. It is vocational training that's out of date.' </p> <p>Managers will need new skills, too. Indeed, some will need to reassess their role completely. 'It's easy to manage bums on seats,' says Reeves, 'but the management model that says that staff sit at their desk for X hours doing Y to earn Z is outdated. Time isn't money as in the industrial era; increasingly it's ideas that are money, and good ideas are like buses - nothing for ages and then three come along at once. </p> <p>'Managers need to focus on tasks and outputs, not time.

      "bodyText": "The work we do and the places we do it in are changing faster than at any time since the industrial revolution. Nobody knows exactly what the long-term effects of this will be, which can make secure career planning difficult. But are we worrying about the wrong questions? If you need to earn a living in the working environment of tomorrow, the key question is not 'how will globalisation and new technology alter it' but 'what skills will I need to survive in it'. That is the question some businesses are beginning to address. The Talent Foundation, for example, which brings together employers as diverse as British Airways, the BBC, the police, the army and Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting), is clear that people, not machines, are the future. 'Human skills are the essential foundations for success in the e-economy,' says the Foundation's Kinga Kowalewska. Richard Reeves of the Industrial Society, agrees: 'Corporate headquarters will probably continue to grow over the next 10 years. But another growing group will be the so-called new nomads - freelances with portfolio careers taking their skills from company to company. But whether you go this route or retain the security of a single employer, the skills you'll require are pretty similar.' So what are these skills? Both Reeves and the Talent Foundation pinpoint not so much the technical or vocational as the very, very human - the sort of things computers can't do, in fact. 'Relationship management, by people both inside and outside of the company structure, will become key,' says Reeves. He is referring to a form of networking that is about more than just mingling amiably at the office party. 'More and more organisations will be focusing on their core activity and sub-contracting out the rest,' he says. 'This won't just be the office cleaning, but also knowledge-rich types of work such as PR or human resources. 'In this environment, the effective worker will be the one with the capacity to retain contact with a wide range of people in a wide range of organisations across a wide range of locations.' He makes a distinction between 'hot' networks, which include people and companies that are going places, and 'cold' ones - which are not. Hot networks constantly refresh themselves as people move in and out. 'Technical skills are becoming increasingly disposable,' he says. 'The computer system you're using now will probably be useless in three years. It will be crucial to develop the ability to recognise when your skills are obsolete and have the confidence to move on. In fact, your existing vocational skills are less important than your ability to learn new ones.' Reeves believes that because of this we will increasingly pursue jobs that afford us the opportunity to learn - a need that, according to the Talent Foundation, many employers can't yet meet. 'Most organisations would agree that they need people who can learn quickly, who can solve problems without being told to and can come up with creative ideas without waiting for others,' says Kowalewska. 'But today's training strategies have a critical blind spot - the learner's motivation to learn. Without appropriate readiness to learn, training investments are destined to fail.' The Foundation's research suggests emotional intelligence and motivational courses to help staff to develop this capacity to learn. 'In our study last year, more emotional intelligence participants perceived learning to be fun - 88 per cent compared with 64 per cent in the control group,' says Kowalewska. 'They also had higher self-awareness (62 compared with 43 per cent) and knew what to learn in order to succeed (71 compared with 61 per cent).' She wants to see more of this sort of training: 'Organisations often attribute their loss of competitiveness and innovation to not having the right people,' she says. 'But investment is not insufficiently focused on developing human skills.' So how strong is your readiness to learn? Reeves' advice is to develop your emotional capacity for it. 'Study what you want to study. What you learn may become out of date or irrelevant, but the capacity to learn and the desire to do it will not. If you like history, study it. Learning for learning's sake is the new modern thinking. It is vocational training that's out of date.' Managers will need new skills, too. Indeed, some will need to reassess their role completely. 'It's easy to manage bums on seats,' says Reeves, 'but the management model that says that staff sit at their desk for X hours doing Y to earn Z is outdated. Time isn't money as in the industrial era; increasingly it's ideas that are money, and good ideas are like buses - nothing for ages and then three come along at once. 'Managers need to focus on tasks and outputs, not time. It's what staff produce, not when and where they produce it. If a worker is meeting targets why should you, as manager, care whether he emails his wife or books holidays from the office computer?' He argues that managers need to stop drawing a line between work and play because it no longer really exists. 'Email snooping, for example, is trying to use new technology to prop up an old model of management,' he says. If you're looking for an employer to help you develop your skills for the future, you could do worse than check out the 20-plus organisations that have signed up to the Talent Foundation's e-talent declaration (www.talentfoundation.org/declaration.html).
