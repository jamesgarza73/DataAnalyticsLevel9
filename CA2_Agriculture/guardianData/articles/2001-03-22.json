McManaman hinted yesterday that Kevin Keegan's policy of giving him a free role was not ideal. </p> <p>\"Just to be given the ball and run everywhere on the pitch is a strange scenario,\" he says. \"You've got other people you could be leaving in the mire.

Graham claims yesterday's revelations are the latest chapter in a campaign being waged against him by certain individuals linked to Tottenham. Lawyers acting for Graham said: \"Mr Graham is disappointed that the club should now be feigning concern and using this scheme as a pretext to try and denigrate his character in the newspapers. \"Having supposedly sacked him for revealing confidential information it is surprising that once again the club is prepared to run its affairs through the leak of internal club information to the press.\" The lawyer's statement said the cash, collected by the club secretary John Alexander, was destined for the Richard House Trust Children's Hospice, after Great Ormond Street Hospital had benefited last year.

      "body": "<p>Manoeuvring to get away from an early election, William Hague distracts attention from what the contest will be about. He's playing a good hand, exploiting the government's inflexible haste without looking as though he's running scared. Plainly Mr Blair is about to switch the argument. Having said for three weeks that a May 3 election can happen because foot and mouth is under control, party managers are getting ready to say the opposite: that the election must happen now because the plague may not be any better under control in September. Delay now and you delay for ever, they've begun to murmur. There's a lot of disingenuous electoralism here, which Hague would be negligent if he did not challenge.</p> <p>But it's not the biggest electoral issue inside the Conservative party. That place belongs to Europe. Europe, in fact, looms into focus all round. For the government, today's EU summit in Stockholm is one of many well carpentered planks in the bridge to May 3. Among the Tory high command, meanwhile, there are rumblings of anxiety about whether the issue will play as they have planned. For the country as a whole, the role of the election as prelude to a euro referendum deserves to be better understood.</p> <p>Mr Hague has always seen Europe as big. Along with crime, asylum and tax, it's one of the four issues he thinks he can make sing. But some of his colleagues are no longer so sure. The so-called liberalising tendency in the party, adherents of Michael Portillo and/or Francis Maude, give voice to other thoughts. These people may be only marginally less Euro-sceptic than Hague is, but they're more sceptical about the impact of Europe on voting, and much more worried about the impact of another Labour landslide on the battle they really care about, the referendum.</p> <p>The election, they know, is lost. But the referendum is not. Yet an election perceived to have been lost after a campaign that majored on Europe would send a calamitous signal. Unlike other Eurosceptics, Tory anti- Europeans do not have a strategy directed at preventing the referendum taking place by persuading Blair he can never win it. Hague's putative successors, if not Hague himself, are banking everything on the referendum as midwife to the rebirth of their party. But they face an election that threatens to pulverise their credibility. Another Labour landslide would make a referendum not merely likely but, I believe, politically very hard for the government to duck away from. If Hague has been smashed on Europe, it would also be decidedly easier to win.</p> <p>These senior colleagues, rivals awaiting their moment, have another doubt. They aren't recognisable as belonging to something called the Tory left, so they weren't fastidiously much offended by Hague's nationalistic garbage on the subject of Britain becoming \"a foreign land\". But many top Tories were taken aback by how badly that keynote speech went down, even with the Sun. Nationalistic crudity, the only way Hague knows how to talk about Europe, turned out not to appeal even to an icon of nationalism. A clash is therefore developing between Hagueites still determined to play Europe big and hard, and others who would now prefer to let the election be lost on different things.</p> <p>This has repercussions for Labour, who are assuming Hague will continue to do his piece. Mr Blair and Robin Cook anticipate the argument with relish. They see it as meat for their contention that the Tories are simply incompetent. The wilder Hague lines give them many ways of showing that this inadequate parvenu shouldn't be trusted.</p> <p>Stockholm, they intend, will add to the unfavourable comparison with themselves. It will be flourished as proof of constructive engagement. It looks as though France, for Mr Jospin's own electoral reasons, won't allow Stockholm to be a Blairite triumph, with full-scale opening up of gas and electricity markets. But there will be enough to make the British case. The financial markets will like another dose of liberal reform, building on last year's Lisbon summit. The relentless ratcheting from one obscure EU meeting to another, which is usually the obsession only of anoraked aficionados, will be presented by the Blair machine, with justice, as progress in the right direction. Such is the unglamorous nature of EU business. But with an election coming, there are few limits to the sparkle that inventive propagandists will be able to bestow on the driest material.</p> <p>If Hague chooses to make the frontal anti-EU case, all this will be a telling riposte. It can be used to distinguish the men of business from the man of Euro-madness. But that is not the only prospect on offer. If Portilloism gets its way, and Europe recedes from the Tory agenda, the challenge to Mr Blair becomes trickier. How will he use the issue of Europe in an active not reactive way? How far will he voluntarily go to make this election, in part, a quest for a mandate to hold the referendum and win it?</p> <p>The easy answer is to say: no distance at all. Safety-first politics still dominates most Labour thinking, however luscious the majority the opinion polls seem to foretell. There's hardly a single Labour politician who can persuade him or herself that pushing Europe up front would win extra seats. An unnoticed lacuna in politics, indeed, is the absence of knowledge, let alone enthusiasm, concerning Europe of most Labour MPs. The place is a great black hole, which may not engage their active hostility but would find them at a loss in a gloves-off debate with the many sharp Tory Eurosceptics whose obsession has equipped them with formidable, if selective, expertise. Labour is mildly pro-European. It has yet to become the party of Europe.</p> <p>On the other hand, the proliferating Tory divisions and confusions - not just Hague v Clarke but Portillo v Hague - present an opportunity which it would be criminal for a European prime minister to miss. Irrespective of how far Mr Hague chooses to jump towards the unacceptable extreme, Mr Blair has his own unique chance to define his victory as a victory, among other things, for his Europe policy, and thereby advance the referendum further into the realm of practical politics.</p> <p>I have no doubt he wants to hold the referendum. Most people underestimate his personal commitment to resolving the misbegotten turmoil the Europe question has brought to modern British history. That's not to say he definitely intends to take the plunge. The gamble could look too great. But the election offers a massive opening to change the terms of trade and remake the odds. If the result is big, it needs to look like a signal for the next and bigger contest. The framework of the campaign is therefore vital. If Hague fails to oblige by offering an open target, let's hope Tony Blair doesn't shrink from inventing his own resonant language for popular endorsement. Seize the day.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;hugoyoung@compuserve.com&quot;\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Manoeuvring to get away from an early election, William Hague distracts attention from what the contest will be about. He's playing a good hand, exploiting the government's inflexible haste without looking as though he's running scared. Plainly Mr Blair is about to switch the argument. Having said for three weeks that a May 3 election can happen because foot and mouth is under control, party managers are getting ready to say the opposite: that the election must happen now because the plague may not be any better under control in September. Delay now and you delay for ever, they've begun to murmur. There's a lot of disingenuous electoralism here, which Hague would be negligent if he did not challenge. But it's not the biggest electoral issue inside the Conservative party. That place belongs to Europe. Europe, in fact, looms into focus all round. For the government, today's EU summit in Stockholm is one of many well carpentered planks in the bridge to May 3. Among the Tory high command, meanwhile, there are rumblings of anxiety about whether the issue will play as they have planned. For the country as a whole, the role of the election as prelude to a euro referendum deserves to be better understood. Mr Hague has always seen Europe as big. Along with crime, asylum and tax, it's one of the four issues he thinks he can make sing. But some of his colleagues are no longer so sure. The so-called liberalising tendency in the party, adherents of Michael Portillo and/or Francis Maude, give voice to other thoughts. These people may be only marginally less Euro-sceptic than Hague is, but they're more sceptical about the impact of Europe on voting, and much more worried about the impact of another Labour landslide on the battle they really care about, the referendum. The election, they know, is lost. But the referendum is not. Yet an election perceived to have been lost after a campaign that majored on Europe would send a calamitous signal. Unlike other Eurosceptics, Tory anti- Europeans do not have a strategy directed at preventing the referendum taking place by persuading Blair he can never win it. Hague's putative successors, if not Hague himself, are banking everything on the referendum as midwife to the rebirth of their party. But they face an election that threatens to pulverise their credibility. Another Labour landslide would make a referendum not merely likely but, I believe, politically very hard for the government to duck away from. If Hague has been smashed on Europe, it would also be decidedly easier to win. These senior colleagues, rivals awaiting their moment, have another doubt. They aren't recognisable as belonging to something called the Tory left, so they weren't fastidiously much offended by Hague's nationalistic garbage on the subject of Britain becoming \"a foreign land\". But many top Tories were taken aback by how badly that keynote speech went down, even with the Sun. Nationalistic crudity, the only way Hague knows how to talk about Europe, turned out not to appeal even to an icon of nationalism. A clash is therefore developing between Hagueites still determined to play Europe big and hard, and others who would now prefer to let the election be lost on different things. This has repercussions for Labour, who are assuming Hague will continue to do his piece. Mr Blair and Robin Cook anticipate the argument with relish. They see it as meat for their contention that the Tories are simply incompetent. The wilder Hague lines give them many ways of showing that this inadequate parvenu shouldn't be trusted. Stockholm, they intend, will add to the unfavourable comparison with themselves. It will be flourished as proof of constructive engagement. It looks as though France, for Mr Jospin's own electoral reasons, won't allow Stockholm to be a Blairite triumph, with full-scale opening up of gas and electricity markets. But there will be enough to make the British case. The financial markets will like another dose of liberal reform, building on last year's Lisbon summit. The relentless ratcheting from one obscure EU meeting to another, which is usually the obsession only of anoraked aficionados, will be presented by the Blair machine, with justice, as progress in the right direction. Such is the unglamorous nature of EU business. But with an election coming, there are few limits to the sparkle that inventive propagandists will be able to bestow on the driest material. If Hague chooses to make the frontal anti-EU case, all this will be a telling riposte. It can be used to distinguish the men of business from the man of Euro-madness. But that is not the only prospect on offer. If Portilloism gets its way, and Europe recedes from the Tory agenda, the challenge to Mr Blair becomes trickier. How will he use the issue of Europe in an active not reactive way? How far will he voluntarily go to make this election, in part, a quest for a mandate to hold the referendum and win it? The easy answer is to say: no distance at all. Safety-first politics still dominates most Labour thinking, however luscious the majority the opinion polls seem to foretell. There's hardly a single Labour politician who can persuade him or herself that pushing Europe up front would win extra seats. An unnoticed lacuna in politics, indeed, is the absence of knowledge, let alone enthusiasm, concerning Europe of most Labour MPs. The place is a great black hole, which may not engage their active hostility but would find them at a loss in a gloves-off debate with the many sharp Tory Eurosceptics whose obsession has equipped them with formidable, if selective, expertise. Labour is mildly pro-European. It has yet to become the party of Europe. On the other hand, the proliferating Tory divisions and confusions - not just Hague v Clarke but Portillo v Hague - present an opportunity which it would be criminal for a European prime minister to miss. Irrespective of how far Mr Hague chooses to jump towards the unacceptable extreme, Mr Blair has his own unique chance to define his victory as a victory, among other things, for his Europe policy, and thereby advance the referendum further into the realm of practical politics. I have no doubt he wants to hold the referendum. Most people underestimate his personal commitment to resolving the misbegotten turmoil the Europe question has brought to modern British history. That's not to say he definitely intends to take the plunge. The gamble could look too great. But the election offers a massive opening to change the terms of trade and remake the odds. If the result is big, it needs to look like a signal for the next and bigger contest. The framework of the campaign is therefore vital. If Hague fails to oblige by offering an open target, let's hope Tony Blair doesn't shrink from inventing his own resonant language for popular endorsement. Seize the day. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "body": "<p>Modern local government began in Birmingham when the mayor and corporation bought the town gasworks and water company and used the profit from light and heat to rebuild the crumbling sewers. The mayor was Joseph Chamberlain and the corporation believed in his Civic Gospel of Improvement. For more than a hundred years, councillors of England's second city continued to act with what Chamberlain called \"sagacious audacity\" - which to them meant a continual increase in expenditure and activity.</p> <p>At the height of its powers, the City of Birmingham owned hospitals, a bus and tramway company, more houses than any other landlord in the West Midlands, and a bank. It was the statutory police authority, managed what were wrongly called state schools, paid \"relief\" to the sick and unemployed and subsidised amenities of its own choice - parks, concert halls, allotments and museums - from rates which it levied at its own discretion. Birmingham councillors were not universally loved, but they were respected as men and women of authority.</p> <p>Ever since the days of Joe Chamberlain's Liberal caucus, party politics has been an essential ingredient in Birmingham local government. Labour has been in tight control for 17 years. Now there are 67 Labour councillors, 28 Conservative and 18 Liberals. There are also five members of Justice, a group of Muslims who demand \"freedom for Kashmir\". Whatever relevance their policy has to municipal government, they reflect the ethnic pattern of the city's population. The 1991 census identified 13.5% of the population as Asian. Half were of Pakistani origin.</p> <p>It is fashionable to suggest that strict party discipline has brought the council into disrepute. Sir Richard Knowles, Labour leader for 10 years, has a different explanation: \"We have lost popularity because we have lost power.\" Whatever the reason for their disenchantment, the people of Birmingham are not enthused by municipal politics. The turnout in the last local election was 28%. The public consultation which preceded the city budget attracted audiences of five in Liberal Yardley and 20 in Tory Sutton Coldfield.</p> <p>None of the meetings produced an outcry against the abandonment of, or reduction in, the caring services. The closure of day centres provoked barely a murmur of protest. Perhaps Birmingham has accepted the view of Sir Michael Lyons, Birmingham's chief executive and once a Labour councillor: \"What the council is expected to do is just not sustainable on present resources.\" Or it may be that the people no longer expect local government to meet their real needs.</p> <p>Birmingham local government is still big business. Its annual budget is more than \u00a32bn. Some 43,000 employees crowd its payroll. But it has lost many of the powers which directly affect the lives and welfare of its citizens. Some council services were nationalised by Labour. Others were privatised by Conservatives. Both parties hedged about council powers with so many regulations that, over great areas of policy, local government became no more than an agent of Whitehall and Westminster. Ministers call the tune because they pay the piper. Birmingham raises 11% of its revenue from council tax. The Treasury provides 63%. That equation makes independence impossible.</p> <p>Education is the one remaining service which gives city councils a popular appeal. The appearance of power deceives. \"In reality,\" says Albert Bore, the council leader, \"we are no longer an education authority. We neither directly provide the service nor set the standards\".</p> <p>Professor Tim Brighouse, the chief education officer, makes the same point in less apocalyptic language. \"It is our duty to secure the provision of an education service. But it is a moot point how much we provide ourselves\". The government's statement on The Role and Function of Local Education Authorities does not spare municipal feelings. It is not the authority's \"role to run or intervene in schools\".</p> <p>Sir Richard believes that we are witnessing \"the slow death of local government\". Mr Bore insists that councils still have a meaningful role. \"But it is not the role we have played over the last 100 years.\" Why, he asks, \"do we have to be a direct provider of services? Once there was nobody else around. Now there is. We can engage others to provide what we want\". He has a new civic gospel to replace what he calls, without noticeable nostalgia, \"50 years of municipal benevolence\". In pursuit of its objective he is promoting the biggest voluntary abdication of power in municipal history.</p> <p><b> Radical</b><br></p> <p>If all goes to plan, by 2002 Birmingham will have privatised its meals-on-wheels and half of its home-care service, transferred its elderly people's homes to a trust and split the direct labour department into four separate - and almost certainly privately owned - operations. More radical still, the entire stock of corporation houses (88,000 in all) will have been given away - together with their debts, which exceed \u00a3650m.</p> <p>The extent of the Labour leader's aspiration has alarmed even David Roy, the leader of the council's Conservative minority. He neither balks at the privatisation of welfare services nor bridles at what amounts to the closure of the direct labour department, and he believes that the council employs \"far too many people for the work we now do\". But he \"feels profoundly uncomfortable about selling all the houses\". John Hemming, the Liberal leader, goes even further in his opposition to what he describes as \"the contract culture\" - the mistaken belief that municipal enterprise is inherently inefficient. From the luxury of opposition he argues that the council should keep the housing stock but run it more efficiently.</p> <p>Improved efficiency, rather than greater democracy, was the object of Margaret Thatcher's local government reforms. Market forces were to exert their influence on councils through a system of compulsory competitive tendering which required, in effect, more and more services to be handed to private enterprise. Labour replaced competitive tendering with an obligation for councils to obtain \"best value\" - without always setting out the criteria against which best value is judged.</p> <p>The scheme is now to be extended by what are known as public service agreements. Birmingham is negotiating with the government to determine 12 specific targets. They range from improving primary school results to reducing the numbers of domestic burglaries. A successful PSA, combined with what is called a best performance plan, will earn the city an extra grant of something like \u00a328m. It will also give Whitehall a new influence over Birmingham policy. But the council shows little sign of resenting or rejecting Whitehall's ever increasing authority. The solution it proposes to the escalating housing crisis is a negotiated deal with central government built on the promise to reduce the city's powers.</p> <p>Until the mid-seventies, Whitehall frantically encouraged council house building with lavish subsidies. Then the mood changed. Margaret Thatcher was not only against council house building, she was the enemy of \"the council house culture\". In the most socially significant decision of her premiership, she gave municipal tenants the \"right to buy\". Seventy five thousand Birmingham families took up the offer. The best properties were sold first and the worst were not sold at all. The council was left with the oldest and most dilapidated houses - and debts of \u00a3650m.</p> <p>Estimates of how much it will cost to rehabilitate the housing stock vary from \u00a31bn to \u00a34bn. This year Birmingham received \u00a380m from the housing investment programme. Almost half will be used to subsidise private properties. \"As things now stand,\" says Mr Bore, knowing that he is stating the obvious, \"the situation gets worse not better\". His remedy - the sale of the whole housing stock - may work. Tony Blair is as opposed to council tenancy as Margaret Thatcher once was. Birmingham hopes that the government will clear its housing debt as the price of ending municipal dependency.</p> <p>A year ago, after pressure from dissatisfied tenants, 3,000 properties on the Lea Bank estate were transferred to the ownership of an independent trust. Mr Bore plans to set up 12 more registered social landlords and divide the housing stock between them, assuming that tenant ballots endorse the change of ownership. The results of the polls are not in much doubt. The choice will lie between a pound a week rent increase linked to a programme of repair and renovation and a rent freeze which guarantees continued dilapidation. Seventy five per cent of tenants receive housing benefit. They can vote for a rent increase in the knowledge that it will be paid by the government.</p> <p>Birmingham's Labour left argues that the government should clear the debt and leave the houses in council ownership. Perhaps it should. But the only hope of the Treasury paying off the debt lies in the council abandoning its role as landlord. Mr Bore could reluctantly accept the end of municipal tenancy as inevitable. But he endorses the government's determination to move the ownership of low-cost, rented houses from corporations to independent trusts. He has \"thought very carefully\" about the merits of council tenancy and decided that it \"does not produce a proper social mix\". His socialist heresy does not end there. Mr Bore has come to the conclusion that Birmingham's direct labour department is, by its nature, uncompetitive.</p> <p>Sir Michael describes the soon-to-be privatised department as \"always too big for an in-house operation\" and \"the victim of long-term poor management\". That is only part of the story. Too often decisions have been taken in the interests of its employees rather than its customers - the people of Birmingham. Every estate echoes with unverifiable stories of petty fraud - repairs recorded as completed but not done. But the real problem is more fundamental. The public works department will lose \u00a38.5m this year, and an estimated \u00a314m next, because the council refused to accept the disciplines required for commercial survival.</p> <p>Right-to-buy legislation reduced Birmingham housing stock by almost half. So, to protect the direct labour workforce, the council increased its repair and maintenance programme to a level which was neither affordable nor sustainable. Then the government insisted that all local authority contracts should be won by competitive tender. The direct labour department bid for its traditional work at hugely optimistic prices. A private builder who made such errors would have gone out of business within a year.</p> <p>So would a privately owned care home that accepted the wage levels and conditions of service which the unions have negotiated with Birmingham council. Care assistants working for the social services department are paid double time and given a day's holiday in lieu if they work on Sunday. Staff who telephone in sick on Sunday morning receive the same compensation for \"working\" unsocial hours. The corporation cannot afford, but dare not abandon, such largesse. A private company will, the theory goes, reduce labour costs in ways no council could contemplate. In Birmingham, the civic ethic now embraces the disciplines of the market.</p> <p>The enterprise culture was imposed on schools when \"local management\" forced the education authorities to compete against private providers for the supply of everything from exercise books to accountancy. Prof Brighouse is gratified by how little advantage Birmingham's headteachers have taken of the new freedom. He ought not to be surprised. The revival in the city's education system is, at least in part, the product of his six years in the city. Prof Brighouse describes his job, crushed between David Blunkett's increasingly detailed demands and the growing autonomy of individual schools, as \"looking down the wrong end of a telescope at a Swiss watch with a spanner in my hand\" - which does not suggest enthusiasm for the new regime. Labouring under that disadvantage, he has transformed Birmingham's education.</p> <p>In his last major act as council leader, Sir Richard commissioned Ted Wragg of Exeter University to head an enquiry into \"the present and future needs of education in Birmingham\". It was a courageous decision. Sir Richard knew that the council's young Turks blamed him for a reduction in the education budget to \u00a370m below the standard spending assessment, the government's estimate of what the city needed to invest in the future. The Wragg report's first recommendation was that \"the council should give education top priority and appropriate standing\". When the time came to appoint a new chief officer, Prof Brighouse seemed the right man to lead the renaissance. Education spending rose to \u00a320m above the spending assessment. Improved examination results moved the city from virtually the bottom to a third of the way up the national league tables. No one is sure which has had the greater effect - money or Prof Brighouse's quirky but dynamic personality.</p> <p>Education, once the city's neglected service, now pioneers new methods of promoting literacy and numeracy - including the University of the First Age, which offers extra teaching for 11 to 15-year-olds in conditions they find congenial rather than constraining. More important, at a time when teachers feel underpaid and undervalued, Prof Brighouse has lifted staff-room morale. His open antagonism to Chris Woodhead, the hugely disliked former chief inspector of schools, helped. So did his successful libel action against John Patten (a brief, but greatly despised, secretary of state) and the decision to donate his damages to school improvements. But it was the way in which he spent his early weeks in the job that won his spurs. He visited schools and talked to teachers. Even within its modern limitation, local government works best when it fulfils its historic destiny to be personal and intimate.</p> <p><b>New civic gospel</b><br></p> <p>.Prof Brighouse has made \"partnership\" with the government work. It is a special use of the word since one of the partners dictates how the other will behave. A white paper, Modern Local Government, leaves no doubt which of the partners is in charge. \"There is no future in the old model of councils trying to plan and run most services\".

      "bodyText": "Modern local government began in Birmingham when the mayor and corporation bought the town gasworks and water company and used the profit from light and heat to rebuild the crumbling sewers. The mayor was Joseph Chamberlain and the corporation believed in his Civic Gospel of Improvement. For more than a hundred years, councillors of England's second city continued to act with what Chamberlain called \"sagacious audacity\" - which to them meant a continual increase in expenditure and activity. At the height of its powers, the City of Birmingham owned hospitals, a bus and tramway company, more houses than any other landlord in the West Midlands, and a bank. It was the statutory police authority, managed what were wrongly called state schools, paid \"relief\" to the sick and unemployed and subsidised amenities of its own choice - parks, concert halls, allotments and museums - from rates which it levied at its own discretion. Birmingham councillors were not universally loved, but they were respected as men and women of authority. Ever since the days of Joe Chamberlain's Liberal caucus, party politics has been an essential ingredient in Birmingham local government. Labour has been in tight control for 17 years. Now there are 67 Labour councillors, 28 Conservative and 18 Liberals. There are also five members of Justice, a group of Muslims who demand \"freedom for Kashmir\". Whatever relevance their policy has to municipal government, they reflect the ethnic pattern of the city's population. The 1991 census identified 13.5% of the population as Asian. Half were of Pakistani origin. It is fashionable to suggest that strict party discipline has brought the council into disrepute. Sir Richard Knowles, Labour leader for 10 years, has a different explanation: \"We have lost popularity because we have lost power.\" Whatever the reason for their disenchantment, the people of Birmingham are not enthused by municipal politics. The turnout in the last local election was 28%. The public consultation which preceded the city budget attracted audiences of five in Liberal Yardley and 20 in Tory Sutton Coldfield. None of the meetings produced an outcry against the abandonment of, or reduction in, the caring services. The closure of day centres provoked barely a murmur of protest. Perhaps Birmingham has accepted the view of Sir Michael Lyons, Birmingham's chief executive and once a Labour councillor: \"What the council is expected to do is just not sustainable on present resources.\" Or it may be that the people no longer expect local government to meet their real needs. Birmingham local government is still big business. Its annual budget is more than \u00a32bn. Some 43,000 employees crowd its payroll. But it has lost many of the powers which directly affect the lives and welfare of its citizens. Some council services were nationalised by Labour. Others were privatised by Conservatives. Both parties hedged about council powers with so many regulations that, over great areas of policy, local government became no more than an agent of Whitehall and Westminster. Ministers call the tune because they pay the piper. Birmingham raises 11% of its revenue from council tax. The Treasury provides 63%. That equation makes independence impossible. Education is the one remaining service which gives city councils a popular appeal. The appearance of power deceives. \"In reality,\" says Albert Bore, the council leader, \"we are no longer an education authority. We neither directly provide the service nor set the standards\". Professor Tim Brighouse, the chief education officer, makes the same point in less apocalyptic language. \"It is our duty to secure the provision of an education service. But it is a moot point how much we provide ourselves\". The government's statement on The Role and Function of Local Education Authorities does not spare municipal feelings. It is not the authority's \"role to run or intervene in schools\". Sir Richard believes that we are witnessing \"the slow death of local government\". Mr Bore insists that councils still have a meaningful role. \"But it is not the role we have played over the last 100 years.\" Why, he asks, \"do we have to be a direct provider of services? Once there was nobody else around. Now there is. We can engage others to provide what we want\". He has a new civic gospel to replace what he calls, without noticeable nostalgia, \"50 years of municipal benevolence\". In pursuit of its objective he is promoting the biggest voluntary abdication of power in municipal history. Radical If all goes to plan, by 2002 Birmingham will have privatised its meals-on-wheels and half of its home-care service, transferred its elderly people's homes to a trust and split the direct labour department into four separate - and almost certainly privately owned - operations. More radical still, the entire stock of corporation houses (88,000 in all) will have been given away - together with their debts, which exceed \u00a3650m. The extent of the Labour leader's aspiration has alarmed even David Roy, the leader of the council's Conservative minority. He neither balks at the privatisation of welfare services nor bridles at what amounts to the closure of the direct labour department, and he believes that the council employs \"far too many people for the work we now do\". But he \"feels profoundly uncomfortable about selling all the houses\". John Hemming, the Liberal leader, goes even further in his opposition to what he describes as \"the contract culture\" - the mistaken belief that municipal enterprise is inherently inefficient. From the luxury of opposition he argues that the council should keep the housing stock but run it more efficiently. Improved efficiency, rather than greater democracy, was the object of Margaret Thatcher's local government reforms. Market forces were to exert their influence on councils through a system of compulsory competitive tendering which required, in effect, more and more services to be handed to private enterprise. Labour replaced competitive tendering with an obligation for councils to obtain \"best value\" - without always setting out the criteria against which best value is judged. The scheme is now to be extended by what are known as public service agreements. Birmingham is negotiating with the government to determine 12 specific targets. They range from improving primary school results to reducing the numbers of domestic burglaries. A successful PSA, combined with what is called a best performance plan, will earn the city an extra grant of something like \u00a328m. It will also give Whitehall a new influence over Birmingham policy. But the council shows little sign of resenting or rejecting Whitehall's ever increasing authority. The solution it proposes to the escalating housing crisis is a negotiated deal with central government built on the promise to reduce the city's powers. Until the mid-seventies, Whitehall frantically encouraged council house building with lavish subsidies. Then the mood changed. Margaret Thatcher was not only against council house building, she was the enemy of \"the council house culture\". In the most socially significant decision of her premiership, she gave municipal tenants the \"right to buy\". Seventy five thousand Birmingham families took up the offer. The best properties were sold first and the worst were not sold at all. The council was left with the oldest and most dilapidated houses - and debts of \u00a3650m. Estimates of how much it will cost to rehabilitate the housing stock vary from \u00a31bn to \u00a34bn. This year Birmingham received \u00a380m from the housing investment programme. Almost half will be used to subsidise private properties. \"As things now stand,\" says Mr Bore, knowing that he is stating the obvious, \"the situation gets worse not better\". His remedy - the sale of the whole housing stock - may work. Tony Blair is as opposed to council tenancy as Margaret Thatcher once was. Birmingham hopes that the government will clear its housing debt as the price of ending municipal dependency. A year ago, after pressure from dissatisfied tenants, 3,000 properties on the Lea Bank estate were transferred to the ownership of an independent trust. Mr Bore plans to set up 12 more registered social landlords and divide the housing stock between them, assuming that tenant ballots endorse the change of ownership. The results of the polls are not in much doubt. The choice will lie between a pound a week rent increase linked to a programme of repair and renovation and a rent freeze which guarantees continued dilapidation. Seventy five per cent of tenants receive housing benefit. They can vote for a rent increase in the knowledge that it will be paid by the government. Birmingham's Labour left argues that the government should clear the debt and leave the houses in council ownership. Perhaps it should. But the only hope of the Treasury paying off the debt lies in the council abandoning its role as landlord. Mr Bore could reluctantly accept the end of municipal tenancy as inevitable. But he endorses the government's determination to move the ownership of low-cost, rented houses from corporations to independent trusts. He has \"thought very carefully\" about the merits of council tenancy and decided that it \"does not produce a proper social mix\". His socialist heresy does not end there. Mr Bore has come to the conclusion that Birmingham's direct labour department is, by its nature, uncompetitive. Sir Michael describes the soon-to-be privatised department as \"always too big for an in-house operation\" and \"the victim of long-term poor management\". That is only part of the story. Too often decisions have been taken in the interests of its employees rather than its customers - the people of Birmingham. Every estate echoes with unverifiable stories of petty fraud - repairs recorded as completed but not done. But the real problem is more fundamental. The public works department will lose \u00a38.5m this year, and an estimated \u00a314m next, because the council refused to accept the disciplines required for commercial survival. Right-to-buy legislation reduced Birmingham housing stock by almost half. So, to protect the direct labour workforce, the council increased its repair and maintenance programme to a level which was neither affordable nor sustainable. Then the government insisted that all local authority contracts should be won by competitive tender. The direct labour department bid for its traditional work at hugely optimistic prices. A private builder who made such errors would have gone out of business within a year. So would a privately owned care home that accepted the wage levels and conditions of service which the unions have negotiated with Birmingham council. Care assistants working for the social services department are paid double time and given a day's holiday in lieu if they work on Sunday. Staff who telephone in sick on Sunday morning receive the same compensation for \"working\" unsocial hours. The corporation cannot afford, but dare not abandon, such largesse. A private company will, the theory goes, reduce labour costs in ways no council could contemplate. In Birmingham, the civic ethic now embraces the disciplines of the market. The enterprise culture was imposed on schools when \"local management\" forced the education authorities to compete against private providers for the supply of everything from exercise books to accountancy. Prof Brighouse is gratified by how little advantage Birmingham's headteachers have taken of the new freedom. He ought not to be surprised. The revival in the city's education system is, at least in part, the product of his six years in the city. Prof Brighouse describes his job, crushed between David Blunkett's increasingly detailed demands and the growing autonomy of individual schools, as \"looking down the wrong end of a telescope at a Swiss watch with a spanner in my hand\" - which does not suggest enthusiasm for the new regime. Labouring under that disadvantage, he has transformed Birmingham's education. In his last major act as council leader, Sir Richard commissioned Ted Wragg of Exeter University to head an enquiry into \"the present and future needs of education in Birmingham\". It was a courageous decision. Sir Richard knew that the council's young Turks blamed him for a reduction in the education budget to \u00a370m below the standard spending assessment, the government's estimate of what the city needed to invest in the future. The Wragg report's first recommendation was that \"the council should give education top priority and appropriate standing\". When the time came to appoint a new chief officer, Prof Brighouse seemed the right man to lead the renaissance. Education spending rose to \u00a320m above the spending assessment. Improved examination results moved the city from virtually the bottom to a third of the way up the national league tables. No one is sure which has had the greater effect - money or Prof Brighouse's quirky but dynamic personality. Education, once the city's neglected service, now pioneers new methods of promoting literacy and numeracy - including the University of the First Age, which offers extra teaching for 11 to 15-year-olds in conditions they find congenial rather than constraining. More important, at a time when teachers feel underpaid and undervalued, Prof Brighouse has lifted staff-room morale. His open antagonism to Chris Woodhead, the hugely disliked former chief inspector of schools, helped. So did his successful libel action against John Patten (a brief, but greatly despised, secretary of state) and the decision to donate his damages to school improvements. But it was the way in which he spent his early weeks in the job that won his spurs. He visited schools and talked to teachers. Even within its modern limitation, local government works best when it fulfils its historic destiny to be personal and intimate. New civic gospel .Prof Brighouse has made \"partnership\" with the government work. It is a special use of the word since one of the partners dictates how the other will behave. A white paper, Modern Local Government, leaves no doubt which of the partners is in charge. \"There is no future in the old model of councils trying to plan and run most services\". Instead they will be required \"to promote the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of their areas\". Birmingham has grasped - perhaps it even anticipated - one element in that stern injunction and elevated it to a new civic gospel. The idea that the corporation should actively encourage commercial development came upon the council gradually and was accepted by some councillors reluctantly and by others not at all. Twenty-five years ago, in a contest which was more about prestige than prosperity, Birmingham beat London in the race to become home to the National Exhibition Centre. Its success was never in doubt. But, situated on the southern boundary, the NEC has not made much of a contribution to the city's economy. It was valued as a status symbol. At one meeting, where the triumph over London was discussed, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was offered as another example of provincial superiority. Everybody agreed that it needed a new concert hall. Nobody could think of a way to raise the money. Someone suggested an approach to the European Community.

The result was the International Convention Centre in which the development fund invested \u00a349.7m. The chamber of commerce and the local CBI thought it could be built next to, or as an extension of, the Exhibition Centre. But the council wanted it in the city centre. While Birmingham was still negotiating with Brussels, the old Victorian concert hall - not half a mile from Chamberlain Square and the town hall - burned down. The city centre was transformed. Almost a third of the council registered the Labour group complaint that Sir Richard was wasting time and money which should have been devoted to education. The convention centre whetted the council's appetite for commercial development. Over 15 years the EU invested another \u00a3175m on tearing the city apart and putting it back together again, as well as more than \u00a3100m in social fund programmes for neighbourhood regeneration. The National Indoor Arena was built next to the ICC. The city took a third share in a Hyatt hotel which was thought necessary to accommodate the expected flood of visitors. Since then hotel building has become a Birmingham growth industry. Few pumps have ever been primed so successfully. Brindley Place and the associated restoration of the canal basin is now a civic showpiece of shops and offices. Seven thousand new jobs have been created in the area, as many as there will be at Rover's Longbridge factory in 2002. The city's commitment to urban regeneration came to practical life in the spring of 1988 at a meeting between representatives of national and local government, business and the various planning professions.

People are that much worse off in terms of how they value their assets. No wonder investors are starting to think about building up their depleted savings again (and therefore stopping spending). Second, it is almost unprecedented for a US recession not to be preceded by a sharp rise in inflation: too much money chasing too few goods. This time there is too little money chasing too many goods because companies have been forced to cut their inventories and slash capital investment. The hitherto blameless Mr Greenspan has been criticised for following market sentiment instead of leading it, because the financial markets wanted an even steeper cut in interest rates. But it is not his job to rescue punters who thought the boom in share prices would go on for ever. And - so far - the economy has not gone into free fall. Consumer spending is still rising, albeit at a far more modest pace than before, and 135,000 new jobs were generated last month, hardly the sign of terminal decline. The trouble is that sentiment is very fragile. It only needs consumers to cut their spending by 3% or 4% for the house of cards to come tumbling down. In these circumstances the Fed must be prepared for further rate cuts and the Bush administration may be justified in spending some of its inherited budget surplus.</p> <p>In these circumstances Europe should err on the side of expansion to ensure that her economy is insulated from any potential US downturn. The trouble is that the ECB, Europe's central bank, is facing a scenario that eurosceptics have long warned about. The medicine needed for Germany (Europe's biggest economy) is different from what most of the other countries need. Economies like France, Italy, Ireland and Spain are powering ahead and do not necessarily require lower interest rates as a stimulus - but Germany, which is expanding at a lacklustre rate - clearly needs a cut. The ECB is almost certainly disposed to keep rates on hold because - unlike the Fed - its mandate is to contain inflation and not to promote growth as well. This would be a mistake because the risk to inflation in Europe is small compared with the need to promote sustained economic growth in Europe in the wake of the US slowdown. Europe's economy is surprisingly self-sufficient and has a current account surplus (in contrast to a whacking US deficit). It is also in the throes of a technological revival - particularly in the wireless sector - that needs nurturing if the continent is to have any chance of emulating the technology-driven spurt in US productivity growth.

In an embarrassing blow, the Commons committee on standards and privileges endorsed a report by the parliamentary standards watchdog which criticised the Conservative leader for failing to correct a \"materially inaccurate\" entry in the register of MPs' interests. Conservative central office refused to comment on the report yesterday which was prompted by a Channel 4 investigation into Mr Hague's claim, in the register of MPs' interests in 1999 and 2000, that all fees from speaking engagements were to be paid into his trust. The investigation, by the Mark Thomas Product programme, found that no money was paid into the William Hague Charitable Trust which was meant to distribute funds in the Tory leader's Richmond constituency. Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner, stated in her report: \"Mr Hague failed to respond correctly on eight occasions when required to check his entry, with the result that it continued in a materially inaccurate form for a considerable period - at least six months and arguably longer.\" The committee's findings against Mr Hague, who has led the Tory charge in recent weeks against the Europe minister Keith Vaz, is the second time that the Tory leader has been reprimanded. In 1999 he failed to register the benefit of using Lord Archer's private gym. Fraser Kemp, Labour MP for Houghton and Washington East, who formally lodged a complaint against Mr Hague, called on the Tory leader to apologise to the Commons. The reprimand from the parliamentary watchdog, which will be an uncomfortable jolt to Mr Hague weeks before the election, highlights a mistake on his part rather than a deliberate attempt to hide payments. \"It should be emphasised that there is no evidence of any intention on Mr Hague's part deliberately to mislead the house and the public,\" Ms Filkin said. The commissioner concluded that the trust was never formally established in law because of legal difficulties. Seven cheques, totalling \u00a31,750, made out to the trust, were never cashed. However, her report highlights a lack of organisation in Mr Hague's office and raises questions about the judgment of his private secretary, Lord Coe, who recommended that the Tory leader should establish the trust. Ms Filkin said that Mr Hague's staff ignored two requests from the Tory leader to amend his entry in the MPs' register. Useful link Full text of the complaint and findings",

Andy Burnham, 32-year-old special adviser to the culture secretary, Chris Smith, beat a union-backed challenger, Ian Wingfield, by a decisive 128 votes to 46 in Leigh, Lancashire, as rumours swirled around Westminster that Tony Blair was poised to \"parachute\" favoured supporters into safe seats at the last minute before the election. Several Labour MPs are said to be prepared to step down to make way for candidates backed by Downing Street or party HQ in Millbank - in return for the prospect of knighthoods, peerages and jobs on quangos. Regional Labour officials insisted that the Leigh party should broaden its original shortlist from four to six to include Mr Burnham and Jenny Smith, a union official. But last night Mr Burnham insisted he had been neither helped nor hindered by Millbank. \"My legitimacy has always been with the members and the fact that I am local. Working the doorstep [in the constituency] paid off in the end,\" he said after a Tuesday night meeting where all six contenders faced questions. As the expected May 3 election looms, a number of seats are falling vacant at the last minute, when pressure of time allows Labour's national executive committee to impose shortlists in consultation with local activists MPs are divided about the leadership's ability to parachute in a favoured candidate in an era when selection is done by a one member one vote ballot. Mr Blair is believed to be particularly anxious to find a seat for the Tory defector, Shaun Woodward. Current rumour focuses on the Welsh seat of Ogmore, where Sir Ray Powell, the local MP, is 72. In Durham North, Kevin Jones, an organiser for the GMB union, had the nomination sewn up so well that aspiring Blair aides quickly melted away. Robin Corbett's Birmingham Erdington seat has attracted the interest of Mr Blair's economics adviser, Derek Scott, T&amp;G union official, Karen Livingstone, and the New Labour journalist Sion Simon.

She also announced inquiries into whether the former paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson, had misled parliament. The double blow to Tony Blair came after Ms Filkin said she would investigate complaints from Tory frontbench spokesmen that both the minister and the ex-minister had hidden facts from MPs. Andrew Lansley, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, has complained that Mr Vaz had not disclosed that the Indian businessmen the Hinduja brothers had given \u00a31,200 to Mapesbury Communications, a company run by the minister's wife, Maria Fernandes. The money is said to have been for a parliamentary reception. Mr Vaz had denied he had received any money from the Hindujas and last night was insisting that he had made no personal gain from the money. Mr Robinson is facing inquiries into whether he misled the former standards commissioner, Sir Gordon Downey, over a \u00a3200,000 payment which it is alleged he solicited from discredited Labour tycoon Robert Maxwell. At the time, Mr Robinson denied any record of the payment - which he said was recorded in his now bankrupt company, Hollis Industries, by mistake. The complaint lodged by David Heathcoat-Amory, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, followed disclosures in the Daily Mail on Monday that an invoice for \u00a3200,000 marked paid to Mr Robinson had been discovered by inspectors appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry to investigate the affair. The newspaper alleged that the report had been kept secret by the trade secretary, Stephen Byers. The fresh inquiry into Mr Vaz comes only a week after the minister was cleared of all but one allegation - that he recommended a lawyer friend, Sarosh Zaiwalla, for an honour without disclosing that his office had received two small donations from him - by the Commons standards and privileges committee. The committee report, however, caused a furore after it was revealed that Ms Filkin had been unable to complete her inquiries into eight allegations after the MP's lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman, refused to answer her questions. One of her unresolved areas was an investigation into Mapesbury Communications where Mr and Mrs Vaz refused to provide full details of the firm's finances. Tony Blair last night dismissed calls to sack Mr Vaz and attacked the Tories for making fresh allegations against him.\"He has my support,\" the prime minister said. Mr Blair added: \"I am not going to dismiss a minister when the allegations that the opposition make against him are investigated and found to be wrong.\" Mr Blair plans to demonstrate his confidence in the minister for Europe by taking him to this weekend's EU summit in Stockholm. Labour MPs are divided over Mr Vaz's conduct. A number expect Mr Blair to quietly drop him after the election. In a fresh statementlast night, Mr Vaz said he was \"surprised\" that the Conservatives had chosen to take up the issue of Mapesbury Communications - which was his wife's company - with Ms Filkin. He said the evidence to the standards and privileges committee showed he had checked with both the registrar of members and the then standards commissioner, Sir Gordon, whether he should register the company. \"They confirmed that this was not necessary.

It urged the government to change the law so doctors can legally prescribe cannabis derivatives as soon as they are scientifically approved. The Lords select committee on science and technology has re-entered the fray after receiving the brush-off from the government in November 1998, when it recommended that doctors should be allowed to prescribe cannabis derivatives; a finding the government rejected. Yesterday the committee published a ten-page report on the progress towards producing a legitimate medicine from the drug. The Medical Research Council has commissioned two trials from scientists to establish the principle that cannabis derivatives can help relieve pain. However, the committee is concerned that it may take a long time for anything practical to emerge from trials. The committee is more encouraged by the progress being made by the GW Pharmaceuticals, which is about to embark onthe large-scale trials of cannabis-based treatments. The report says the government's attitude lately has been more encouraging, following a period in which it feared that \"permitting therapeutic preparations of cannabis to be prescribed would be interpreted by the public as a move towards allowing recreational use\". Lord Perry of Walton, a committee member, said yesterday that he hoped there might be a cannabis-derived medicine on the market within two years.

It has to learn a new language of governing, which acknowledges the realities of coalition. The problem here is less Tony Blair than Labour's successful chancellor, Gordon Brown, and his very Westminster view of devolution.

      "body": "<p>The government's strategy for combatting the foot and mouth outbreak will come under renewed scrutiny today after a decision by the Dutch authorities to vaccinate thousands of animals to prevent the disease spreading in the Netherlands.</p> <p>The vaccination policy, authorised by farm minister Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst, has so far been rejected by Britain and the rest of the EU.</p> <p>An emergency meeting of the EU's veterinary committee has been called for tomorrow to discuss the crisis.</p> <p>Around 17,000 animals in a one kilometre ring immediately round the Dutch outbreaks in the villages of Olst and Oene in the east of the country and at Oosterwolde 15 miles away will be slaughtered, but in a further zone all animals will be vaccinated to control the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Once all disease has been eradicated, all vaccinated animals will be killed and removed \"in an orderly fashion\", the Dutch government said.</p> <p>Pressure to adopt similar tactics has come from senior British vets who believe the slaughter policy will not stop the spread of the disease.</p> <p>The government, which has not explicitly ruled out vaccination, believes it would prolong the time for which Britain could not export animals because of the loss of the country's disease-free status.</p> <p>The extent of the crisis in Britain was revealed by the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, yesterday.</p> <p>He said there was no longer any market for the millions of lambs being born, leaving thousands of farmers facing destitution. The export market for lambs is worth \u00a378m a year.</p> <p>The knock-on effect of the crisis on tourism and rural businesses had forecasters warning yesterday that it could help to knock 0.7 percentage points off economic growth this year.</p> <p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), a consultancy firm, said that along with the stockmarket crash, foot and mouth would help to reduce growth this year to 2%, after last year's 3% expansion. The government has already paid out \u00a370m to farmers for compulsorily slaughtered animals and the bill for those being killed now will be another \u00a3300m.</p> <p>The number of cases rose to 430 with 36 new cases reported yesterday, 21 of them in Cumbria. The number of animals to be destroyed passed 420,000 - the same number in four weeks of this outbreak that had to be destroyed in six months of the 1967 epidemic.</p> <p>Giving evidence to the Commons agriculture select committee, Mr Brown said the whole subsidy system based on numbers of sheep on farms would have to go.</p> <p>Two thirds of trade was overseas so farmers' income would have to be supported while the trade was reorganised. An early retirement scheme for farmers would be offered.</p> <p>\"Because of the sheep breeding cycle we are in for a very long haul before farmers have anything to sell next year,\" Mr Brown said.</p> <p>But while farming and the tourism industry are suffering, consumers could see an unexpected side benefit in the form of lower borrowing costs.</p> <p>The CEBR said it believed that the Bank of England would be forced to shave 0.75 percentage points off borrowing costs, taking rates down to 5%, in order to offset the economic slowdown.</p> <p>In the Commons, Tony Blair said he would push on with local elections - and by implication a general election - on May 3.</p> <p>Challenged by William Hague at question time, Mr Blair said that cancelling local elections would send out a signal that Britain was \"closed for business\", which would have damaging consequences for the tourist industry, already badly hit by the crisis.</p> <p>\"I simply ask: postpone until when?\", Mr Blair told Mr Hague. \"One month, two months, six months?

The vaccination policy, authorised by farm minister Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst, has so far been rejected by Britain and the rest of the EU. An emergency meeting of the EU's veterinary committee has been called for tomorrow to discuss the crisis. Around 17,000 animals in a one kilometre ring immediately round the Dutch outbreaks in the villages of Olst and Oene in the east of the country and at Oosterwolde 15 miles away will be slaughtered, but in a further zone all animals will be vaccinated to control the spread of the disease. Once all disease has been eradicated, all vaccinated animals will be killed and removed \"in an orderly fashion\", the Dutch government said. Pressure to adopt similar tactics has come from senior British vets who believe the slaughter policy will not stop the spread of the disease. The government, which has not explicitly ruled out vaccination, believes it would prolong the time for which Britain could not export animals because of the loss of the country's disease-free status. The extent of the crisis in Britain was revealed by the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, yesterday. He said there was no longer any market for the millions of lambs being born, leaving thousands of farmers facing destitution. The export market for lambs is worth \u00a378m a year. The knock-on effect of the crisis on tourism and rural businesses had forecasters warning yesterday that it could help to knock 0.7 percentage points off economic growth this year. The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), a consultancy firm, said that along with the stockmarket crash, foot and mouth would help to reduce growth this year to 2%, after last year's 3% expansion. The government has already paid out \u00a370m to farmers for compulsorily slaughtered animals and the bill for those being killed now will be another \u00a3300m. The number of cases rose to 430 with 36 new cases reported yesterday, 21 of them in Cumbria. The number of animals to be destroyed passed 420,000 - the same number in four weeks of this outbreak that had to be destroyed in six months of the 1967 epidemic. Giving evidence to the Commons agriculture select committee, Mr Brown said the whole subsidy system based on numbers of sheep on farms would have to go. Two thirds of trade was overseas so farmers' income would have to be supported while the trade was reorganised. An early retirement scheme for farmers would be offered. \"Because of the sheep breeding cycle we are in for a very long haul before farmers have anything to sell next year,\" Mr Brown said. But while farming and the tourism industry are suffering, consumers could see an unexpected side benefit in the form of lower borrowing costs. The CEBR said it believed that the Bank of England would be forced to shave 0.75 percentage points off borrowing costs, taking rates down to 5%, in order to offset the economic slowdown. In the Commons, Tony Blair said he would push on with local elections - and by implication a general election - on May 3. Challenged by William Hague at question time, Mr Blair said that cancelling local elections would send out a signal that Britain was \"closed for business\", which would have damaging consequences for the tourist industry, already badly hit by the crisis. \"I simply ask: postpone until when?\", Mr Blair told Mr Hague. \"One month, two months, six months? In 1967 this disease went on for eight months.\" What's going on?

      "body": "<p>Sharp at four on a sunny winter's afternoon, the Guardian turns up with Tony Benn on the doorstep of Sir Edward Heath's London home, a terraced Belgravia house within sight of the garden wall of Buckingham Palace. It may seem an unlikely meeting, but the two have shared the past half-century in parliament. And when the coming election is called, both will retire from the Commons. Neither will go to the Lords.</p> <p>Heath, the former Conservative prime minister (1970-74) and bete noire of the Tory right, was first elected for Bexley - now Old Bexley and Sidcup - in the general election of February 23 1950. Unlike Benn, he has unbroken service. The Labour ex-cabinet minister (1964-70 and 1974-79) reached the Commons via a byelection in Bristol South East a few months later, but briefly lost his seat twice.</p> <p>Though Heath, at 84, is the elder by nine years and has always been the more senior politician, their paths have crossed many times during careers of great influence on our times. My plan is to explore the changes they have seen in the past 50 years.</p> <p>Both veterans have just come from the now-weekly session of prime minister's question time. \"My God, it is awful now, isn't it,\" says Heath, by way of an opener. \"I'm afraid I dozed off,\" confesses Benn. \"I've done it once or twice now. I can't bear it.\"</p> <p>They agree about much of what is wrong: they both dislike the replacement of 15-minute sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays with Blair's single 30 minutes on Wednesdays, just as they disliked the move in the 60s from specific questions to general ones designed to trip up the PM rather than elicit a detailed answer.</p> <p>As to how to remedy the problem - or others we discuss - there is rather less agreement, though outright disagreement is politely avoided. It is just possible to imagine that the former Viscount Stansgate regards the former Mr Heath as a technocrat at heart, not very interested in the democratic questions that preoccupy him; and that, in return, Benn is regarded as a bit of a gadfly.</p> <p>But it is all very polite, a bit like watching the great theatrical knights in old age - Olivier, Gielgud or Richardson - circling each other's eminence on the stage, warily but not unkindly. The unspoken eloquence of their pauses is worthy of Pinter himself.</p> <p>They agree that 1956 was a turning point in postwar history, chiefly because the US thwarted the secret Anglo-French plan to recapture the newly nationalised Suez Canal by invading Egypt in collusion with Israel. As chief whip, Heath was one of just four British ministers in the know.</p> <p>By 1956, Winston Churchill, who liked Heath enough to give him two of his own paintings (they hang on the wall of his other home in Salisbury), had finally retired as prime minister at 80. Anthony Eden, his dashing, doomed successor, wanted to make his mark. \"Some of us understood it beforehand and always believed he [Eden] was wrong in what he was doing,\" says Heath. \"I told him so privately; never discussed it publicly. But he didn't share that view, so they carried on. By the end of it [when US pressure on sterling forced a withdrawal from the canal after six days] Macmillan [then chancellor] certainly realised it meant the end of that period. That is why he supported our entry into Europe in 1961.\"</p> <p>He does not have time to add that President De Gaulle of France vetoed his own efforts to negotiate British entry into the then four-year-old European common market, and that he only got us in when he was prime minister 12 years later. Benn intervenes: \"Because he [Macmillan] saw the Americans let us down. I went to see Walter Monckton [minister of labour] privately at the time of Suez to see if he could head it off. Collusion was the thing, the deal between the French and British; it was the first time since the war or subsequently when the American president simply vetoed a British manoeuvre.\"</p> <p>As ever, Benn is making contemporary political points. He points out that in the 60s Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, had refused US appeals to send a token British force to fight in Vietnam. \"But otherwise, am I wrong in saying all British governments since 1945 have done what the Americans wanted ?\"</p> <p>\"I wouldn't go that far,\" replies Heath, who rarely goes as far as Benn. \"On Vietnam I wouldn't play with them either. I didn't play with Kissinger over India [the 1971 war with Pakistan], where he wanted us to go in. And I didn't play when he wanted to go into Cyprus, when he wanted to go in with the Israeli [Yom Kippur] war.\"</p> <p>In its efforts to re-equip the Israeli armed forces, the US was forced to fly supplies in via the Azores: retaliation for the Suez affair, one might be tempted to murmur. Heath does not. He is busy recalling the speech he made at President Richard Nixon's side on the White House lawn at that time. \"My remark was that there is no special relationship between Britain and the United States. What there was, was an historic relationship that was much stronger. A special relationship you can break up at any time if you reach a stage of disagreement. An historic relationship is there all the time.\"</p> <p>Again, the reproach to less perceptive successors hangs in the air, unstated. Benn is less reticent. \"We do not have an independent [nuclear] deterrent,\" he interjects. \"Americans lend us Trident, the United States controls our intelligence. If we were to go against American policy we would be seen to be a non-nuclear power. If we are locked into star wars [President Bush's missile defence plan] against the opposition of most of the countries of Europe, this is going to test the nuclear relationship to the full.\"</p> <p>These questions have a habit of coming full circle. Benn, who addresses his old rival as Ted (a gesture that is not reciprocated), remembers daring to ask Churchill a question about nuclear relations with the US in the early 50s and being ticked off by Clem Attlee, the former prime minister. \"You shouldn't have asked that question, because I'm the only one who knows anything about it,\" the party leader told him.</p> <p>\"But that was real. Something else is happening which is more fundamental than the points Ted is mentioning. Modern politics is about the marketing of personalities. We are invited to be spectators of what the great and the good do. I think that has infected the house,\" says Benn. \"I agree with Ted, PM's questions are awful. It could easily be stopped if the prime minister, when he got to a question from the leader of the opposition, said, 'That's an interesting point. I will have a look.' The whole thing would collapse.\"</p> <p>It is not that they are against progress. They both think the modern select committee system is an important development and are glad that MPs are better paid (until the 60s they paid for their own stamps) and have staff and offices in which to work - although it diminishes the collegiate atmosphere, the time MPs used to spend together simply talking. One problem, says Heath, is that MPs come in expecting to be ministers within three years. His old patron, Harold Macmillan (PM from 1957 to 1963) waited 17 years before he got a job, he says. But you were made a whip within a year of being elected, I counter, and were chief whip by 1955. \"Eleven months, I was very quick,\" he concedes, without the need for further justification.</p> <p>\"I had to wait 14 years,\" interjects Benn. \"You were a whip under Winston, were you?\"</p> <p>Heath: \"Yes, I was.\"</p> <p>Benn: \"Well, there you are.\"</p> <p>Benn then complains that ministers spend \"less and less time dealing with executive matters, and just go round opening things and closing things and tripping up over things and all the rest of it\". \"Pure propaganda,\" says Heath, which brings Benn around to his childhood in a political household (his father had also been a cabinet minister), watching the rise of Hitler.</p> <p>\"I bought Mein Kampf when I was about eight and I still read it. It's an astonishing book. He said democracy inevitably leads to Marxism. Work that one out!\" His point is that \"if you don't do people justice, they'll go for a demagogue. Any nation that loses confidence in democracy will be seduced. That's the thing that makes me worry about the fall in turnout in America.\" He mentions the Nuremberg rallies.</p> <p>Heath remains silent. As an Oxford student of modest origins and progressive instincts, he took himself off to Germany to inspect Hitler at close quarters. Making his way to Nuremberg in 1937, his memoirs report, he witnessed the F\u00fchrer walking to the podium, \"his shoulder brushing mine as he went past\". \"This experience subsequently dominated my political life,\" Heath would one day write, confirming him as an anti-appeaser, later (after he had returned to Germany in battle) as a passionate European, convinced that only a Europe \"united, free and democratic\" would be safe from the demons of ultranationalism.</p> <p>The conversation moves on. But we come back to it via what both the old warriors agree is a disturbing tendency towards global interventionism by the US, with Britain tagging along in its wake.</p> <p>Heath: \"What is happening alarms me because this Labour government is jumping back 50 years and trying to exert its influence in the world in what is really a colonial atmosphere and system ... There was a parliamentary commission which went out to China and produced a report which was really incredible. It was a report of a colonial power telling its colony what it's got to do. The way we have [also] intervened in Sierra Leone is really colonial.\"</p> <p>\"I agree with Ted,\" says Benn. \"Just as the 19th century was characterised by the British empire and the 21st by the American empire, that is domination of a military kind nobody has ever contemplated. Britain is now piggy-backing on American power to pretend we have the power. We don't have the power to do anything about Saddam Hussein.\"</p> <p>Benn sees Britain trying to find a place in a changing world. \"On Europe I understand exactly what Ted feels; I respect him; he's been consistent. He saw wars that split Europe, that destroyed it, and wants to bring it together. No nonsense about convergence criteria [for entry into the euro]. To him it's a political thing.</p> <p>\"If only we could explore the options without it being said that Ted wants the Brussels commission to give instructions to every parking meter. Or that he says we are anti-European, which I'm not. Let's have a rational debate, if only the House of Commons could have a serious debate about Europe.\"</p> <p>Heath: \"All my debate is rational.\"</p> <p>Benn: \"I know, Ted. I have never doubted you were - are - a model for us all.\"</p> <p>Heath perks up. He recently spent a fruitful day discussing Europe with Oxford dons. \"The fact is it is a political question, first and foremost. But what we have to realise is that we can't stand outside and keep saying we are going to come in,\" he says sharply. \"And Blair made this ghastly mistake, he went on and on. And finally the German chancellor blew up and said, 'Prime minister, this is our union and we decide what will happen. And you can't do it for us. That was when Blair took his first crack and he's been mainly quiet since then.\"</p> <p>Going into Europe late and then telling them what to do \"drove them absolutely mad. I didn't do it; that's why I'm still respected in most of Europe. I recognised that you have got to show them that you are part of them before you can start influencing them in a particular direction.\"</p> <p>Benn starts to intervene, then Heath asks him his only direct question of the session. \"Does your prime minister really think he has got his party lined up ?\"</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" Benn replies. \"If you want advice about the prime minister's thoughts, don't come to me. I am not privy.\"</p> <p>The Blair cabinet \"are under tremendous pressure, to which they give way the whole time, from the press,\" says Heath. This is one of his recurrent dislikes because what he sometimes calls the \"foreign-owned press\" (Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black) are so hostile to Europe.</p> <p>I ask what is wrong with the press. \"Everything. We have the worst press in the world; the people who have now captured the press are of that calibre, that outlook. I had lunch with one of its editors a short time ago and said, 'You know, it's the influence of the owners and editors on the press that is causing the trouble.' He said, 'The public take it from us, not you.' \"</p> <p>\"Like the medieval church,\" chips in Benn. Heath says he doesn't want to discuss individuals - and then does. \"If you take the question of Murdoch, he declared that he was supporting the Labour party and, if you look at his papers, they couldn't be more opposed, supporting the Tory party indirectly.\"</p> <p>Benn says he is constantly amazed at the media's failure to report what matters to the people who turn up at public meetings. \"I have done five with over 1,000 people, on Palestine, the sale of council houses, cuts in Hackney, globalisation.\" And he contradicts Heath's notion that, in the good old days, Lords Beaverbrook and Northcliffe separated the news from the comment columns. \"A slightly dreamy view of the past,\" he ventures.</p> <p>I ask Heath if the press and electorate should have been told when Churchill suffered a stroke in 1953 while he was still in charge. It elicits a very Heath-ish: \"No, why should you have done?\" As with Suez, very few were in the know, including both the Queen and Heath, as deputy chief whip. \"We were able to handle the situation extremely well.\" And Churchill recovered. \"I shall never forget the party conference at Margate. We had this great rally and there was Winston. The chief whip sat behind him and the speech went splendidly. Then we got to this thing where he turned over the page and started reading the same thing again.</p> <p>\"The chief whip looked at me and said, 'Sorry, this is the end.' But Churchill then said, 'I seem to have heard this somewhere before. Perhaps I should turn on.' So he turned over the page and went on. He lasted 18 months after that.\"</p> <p>When I later telephone Heath to clarify a few points, I ask what his most important achievements were. Getting into Europe he calls only \"a major achievement\", which surprises me. He rattles off reform of the tax system; freeing up the housing market to cope with modern needs; the abortive 1971 Industrial Relations Act, a better deal for the unions that broke it than they got from the next Tory government. There were also changes to the immigration laws that, he says, stopped the issue being a \"continuous sore\" - a reference to Enoch Powell, whom he bravely sacked for his \"rivers of blood\" speech in 1968.</p> <p>Benn's answer to the same question on the phone is that he is glad to have campaigned early for reforms that eventually prevailed - \"acorns which became trees\", as he puts it. Lords reform, of course; freedom of information; gay rights; a trade boycott against apartheid South Africa. Even public ownership is creeping back into fashion, he suggests. \"I get letters from people who say, 'I have never agreed with a word you said in your life, Mr Benn,' but then proceed to repeat what I said. You are glad you didn't give up when everyone else gave up.\"</p> <p>Great figures of their time? I ask them both. This is a hard one for politicians, among whom - even the most virtuous - ego is a significant component in any 50-year career. Heath does not mention you-know-who, his nemesis from Finchley. But he is loyal to his friends. \"Eden has been underestimated because of Suez. What he did in the 30s and early 50s [as foreign secretary] was excellent diplomacy.\" As for Macmillan, \"opinions differ; most of it is wrong\". But his stock too will recover.</p> <p>Benn deplores personality politics, though he has a formidable political personality himself. So he cites speeches instead: Nye Bevan on western rearmament in the 50s, warning that it would lead to a witchhunt against socialists; the young Iain Macleod (who died after three weeks as Heath's chancellor in 1970) famously attacking the great Nye in his maiden speech. Powell was \"always worth listening to.

Churchill and Nye, Mao and Nixon, Khrushchev and De Gaulle - a major link between the Commons and its past is about to be severed.

      "bodyText": "Sharp at four on a sunny winter's afternoon, the Guardian turns up with Tony Benn on the doorstep of Sir Edward Heath's London home, a terraced Belgravia house within sight of the garden wall of Buckingham Palace. It may seem an unlikely meeting, but the two have shared the past half-century in parliament. And when the coming election is called, both will retire from the Commons. Neither will go to the Lords. Heath, the former Conservative prime minister (1970-74) and bete noire of the Tory right, was first elected for Bexley - now Old Bexley and Sidcup - in the general election of February 23 1950. Unlike Benn, he has unbroken service. The Labour ex-cabinet minister (1964-70 and 1974-79) reached the Commons via a byelection in Bristol South East a few months later, but briefly lost his seat twice. Though Heath, at 84, is the elder by nine years and has always been the more senior politician, their paths have crossed many times during careers of great influence on our times. My plan is to explore the changes they have seen in the past 50 years. Both veterans have just come from the now-weekly session of prime minister's question time. \"My God, it is awful now, isn't it,\" says Heath, by way of an opener. \"I'm afraid I dozed off,\" confesses Benn. \"I've done it once or twice now. I can't bear it.\" They agree about much of what is wrong: they both dislike the replacement of 15-minute sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays with Blair's single 30 minutes on Wednesdays, just as they disliked the move in the 60s from specific questions to general ones designed to trip up the PM rather than elicit a detailed answer. As to how to remedy the problem - or others we discuss - there is rather less agreement, though outright disagreement is politely avoided. It is just possible to imagine that the former Viscount Stansgate regards the former Mr Heath as a technocrat at heart, not very interested in the democratic questions that preoccupy him; and that, in return, Benn is regarded as a bit of a gadfly. But it is all very polite, a bit like watching the great theatrical knights in old age - Olivier, Gielgud or Richardson - circling each other's eminence on the stage, warily but not unkindly. The unspoken eloquence of their pauses is worthy of Pinter himself. They agree that 1956 was a turning point in postwar history, chiefly because the US thwarted the secret Anglo-French plan to recapture the newly nationalised Suez Canal by invading Egypt in collusion with Israel. As chief whip, Heath was one of just four British ministers in the know. By 1956, Winston Churchill, who liked Heath enough to give him two of his own paintings (they hang on the wall of his other home in Salisbury), had finally retired as prime minister at 80. Anthony Eden, his dashing, doomed successor, wanted to make his mark. \"Some of us understood it beforehand and always believed he [Eden] was wrong in what he was doing,\" says Heath. \"I told him so privately; never discussed it publicly. But he didn't share that view, so they carried on. By the end of it [when US pressure on sterling forced a withdrawal from the canal after six days] Macmillan [then chancellor] certainly realised it meant the end of that period. That is why he supported our entry into Europe in 1961.\" He does not have time to add that President De Gaulle of France vetoed his own efforts to negotiate British entry into the then four-year-old European common market, and that he only got us in when he was prime minister 12 years later. Benn intervenes: \"Because he [Macmillan] saw the Americans let us down. I went to see Walter Monckton [minister of labour] privately at the time of Suez to see if he could head it off. Collusion was the thing, the deal between the French and British; it was the first time since the war or subsequently when the American president simply vetoed a British manoeuvre.\" As ever, Benn is making contemporary political points. He points out that in the 60s Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, had refused US appeals to send a token British force to fight in Vietnam. \"But otherwise, am I wrong in saying all British governments since 1945 have done what the Americans wanted ?\" \"I wouldn't go that far,\" replies Heath, who rarely goes as far as Benn. \"On Vietnam I wouldn't play with them either. I didn't play with Kissinger over India [the 1971 war with Pakistan], where he wanted us to go in. And I didn't play when he wanted to go into Cyprus, when he wanted to go in with the Israeli [Yom Kippur] war.\" In its efforts to re-equip the Israeli armed forces, the US was forced to fly supplies in via the Azores: retaliation for the Suez affair, one might be tempted to murmur. Heath does not. He is busy recalling the speech he made at President Richard Nixon's side on the White House lawn at that time. \"My remark was that there is no special relationship between Britain and the United States. What there was, was an historic relationship that was much stronger. A special relationship you can break up at any time if you reach a stage of disagreement. An historic relationship is there all the time.\" Again, the reproach to less perceptive successors hangs in the air, unstated. Benn is less reticent. \"We do not have an independent [nuclear] deterrent,\" he interjects. \"Americans lend us Trident, the United States controls our intelligence. If we were to go against American policy we would be seen to be a non-nuclear power. If we are locked into star wars [President Bush's missile defence plan] against the opposition of most of the countries of Europe, this is going to test the nuclear relationship to the full.\" These questions have a habit of coming full circle. Benn, who addresses his old rival as Ted (a gesture that is not reciprocated), remembers daring to ask Churchill a question about nuclear relations with the US in the early 50s and being ticked off by Clem Attlee, the former prime minister. \"You shouldn't have asked that question, because I'm the only one who knows anything about it,\" the party leader told him. \"But that was real. Something else is happening which is more fundamental than the points Ted is mentioning. Modern politics is about the marketing of personalities. We are invited to be spectators of what the great and the good do. I think that has infected the house,\" says Benn. \"I agree with Ted, PM's questions are awful. It could easily be stopped if the prime minister, when he got to a question from the leader of the opposition, said, 'That's an interesting point. I will have a look.' The whole thing would collapse.\" It is not that they are against progress. They both think the modern select committee system is an important development and are glad that MPs are better paid (until the 60s they paid for their own stamps) and have staff and offices in which to work - although it diminishes the collegiate atmosphere, the time MPs used to spend together simply talking.

I don't mean to make you jealous, but it was yet another perfect day.

We stayed there until closing time then - it being Sunday - we had to settle for a 24-hour pool hall as the next available option.

I even managed to get some exercise that first day with a walk along the coastal path that runs from Coogee to Bondai, where I enjoyed all the lovely views of the various bays and beaches that accompany it. That evening, Brian and I went out for dinner to La Spiaggiata, a permanently busy restauraunt on Coogee Bay Road. I had a really gorgeous, really reasonably priced pasta dinner, which explains why it's always so unbelievably packed in there. For the rest of the evening a group of us (some ex-hostel, others picked up along the way) headed to a pub in Bondai as it was Brian's last night in Australia. </p> <p> I think the weirdness of actually returning home hit both of us the next day as we sat on the beach before Brian's flight.

      "bodyText": "Moscow has expelled 50 US diplomats after the Americans sent home 51 Russian diplomats it accused of spying. Igor Ivanov, Russia's foreign minister, had earlier condemned the expulsion as a \"political act\" for which Washington had no grounds. It was the first direct official response from the Russian government to the news that the US had ordered the immediate expulsion of six diplomats and the departure of 45 others by summer. \"There are no and have been no grounds for this,\" Mr Ivanov said in a statement read over state-controlled ORT television. \"If anyone had any questions or doubts, this could easily have been settled along... special channels and by special contacts,\" he said, referring to the \"well-established\" ties between Moscow and Washington. The expulsion, the largest since the collapse of communism, follows the arrest in Washington last month of a suspected Russian spy, the FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who is accused of passing information to Moscow for the past 15 years, an official confirmed to US news agencies. In the initial phase of the expulsion, six members of the Russian embassy staff in Washington were declared persona non grata and asked to leave the country yesterday. Most of the rest of the group have been asked to leave because the US says that Russia is maintaining too many intelligence officers at its embassy. The current number of active Russian intelligence operatives in the US is thought to be around 450. The expulsion will plunge relations between Washington and Moscow to a new low. There has already been resentment that Mr Bush has delayed meeting the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and a bitter diplomatic row over the US decision to meet an envoy from the rebel Chechen government, an action which Moscow claims will only encourage Chechen terrorism. The Russian ambassador to the US was summoned to the state department yesterday and was told by the secretary of state, Colin Powell, that the suspected spies had to leave the country. Though there have been occasional arrests and expulsions of spies on both sides in recent years, such incidents have not threatened US-Russian relations in a serious way. The new expulsions could be different both because of their number and because of the US administration's fury at the scale of Mr Hanssen's alleged betrayals, which are said to include telling Russia about the existence of an elaborate US spying tunnel dug deep under the Russian embassy complex. Mr Hanssen is currently in custody in an undisclosed secure location while prosecutors grapple with the difficulty of preparing an indictment which does not reveal important state secrets. There has been speculation that he may be prepared to plead guilty to a range of spying charges in return for assisting US intelligence agents. Six Russians who picked up documents left by Mr Hanssen have already left the US. The last incident on this scale occurred in 1986 when President Ronald Reagan expelled 80 Soviet diplomats.

      "bodyText": "Extra funding is needed to boost the number of trained counsellors from ethnically diverse backgrounds, a new report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has urged. The report, carried out by the Scottish Ethnic Minorities Research Unit at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, looked at Asian people's perceptions and experiences of counselling services among 10 voluntary sector providers in Glasgow, Leeds, Bristol and London. It found that most mainstream counselling agencies offer black and Asian clients only a limited choice when it comes to the type of counsellor, language used and location. Many offer counselling in English only and tend to rely on their counsellors learning about the significance of cultural and religious issues from their clients. But, while most counselling agencies acknowledge the importance of having a culturally diverse workforce, few are investing any effort in encouraging black applicants for training courses. Few agencies are also specifically targeting black and Asian communities when actively promoting their services because of their long waiting lists and concerns about their ability to meet any increase in demand. \"Given that the agencies were located in areas with a relatively dense population of minority ethnic people, the low use of most agencies' services by black people, including Asian people, was disturbing,\" the report concludes. By contrast, the few black-led counselling agencies believe it is important to have a deep understanding of the cultural and religious background of their clients and are able to provide counselling in a number of languages. \"The tendency of most mainstream agencies to trust that these agencies would cater to the needs of clients who did not speak English was worrying, given the very limited number of black-led agencies,\" the report says. The report calls for agencies to improve their services by liaising with agencies whose work brings them into contact with black people, encouraging more self-referrals through a targeted outreach and publicity strategy, and providing more flexible services such as drop-in services and surgeries in black-led agencies. Counselling should be made more appropriate by increasing the number of trained counsellors from diverse communities, training existing counsellors and involving experienced black counsellors or professionals. Agencies should also carry out ethnic monitoring, examine the long term impact of their services on black clients and organise focus groups with black clients to obtain feedback. \"Black communities too have a role in promoting awareness and acceptability of counselling services by examining their own attitudes to mental health and encouraging people from their communities to seek appropriate support with psychological difficulties and stress,\" the report stresses. Gina Netto, assistant director of the Scottish Ethnic Minorities Research Unit and co-author of the report, said the study had found a high incidence of mental health problems in the Asian community, the most extreme manifestations being a higher than average rate of suicide and self-harm among young Asian women. \"Counselling services are very relevant in preventing the deterioration of mental ill-health to the point at which it reaches crisis proportions. If they are to be used by Asian and black communities, they have to be accessible and appropriate to their cultural needs,\" she said. The Commission for Racial Equality said it welcomed the report and hoped voluntary sector counselling providers would take its findings on board. \"This is not unusual.

This Chicken Licken' forecasting has its origin in a 10-year accumulation of pessimism that has left many thinking that no matter how bad things have got, the worst is yet to come.

      "body": "<p>It was an oddly low-key start to an oddly low-key race. The prize was to lead a city that considers itself the centre of the universe and the hotel ballroom was decked with campaign posters. They said \"mebq\".</p> <p>Several observers at the launch of the first official contender in the race to become the mayor of New York looked puzzled, until someone explained that it meant \"most experienced, best qualified\". Alan Hevesi had decided to use his two-term record as a city comptroller - a sort of state accountant - as the basis for his campaign.</p> <p>Of more interest to political observers was the fact that the Democrat also chose to praise the incumbent mayor, a man many of his party believe to be the Antichrist.</p> <p>Mr Hevesi hedged his enthusiasm for Rudy Giuliani but it was there and obvious all the same. \"In large part - not for everyone yet, and not everywhere - our city is going in the right direction,\" he said, after eight years of Giuliani's stewardship. \"Some people want to pretend that's not true: they root for bad things to happen in our city on Rudy's watch becuse they don't like Rudy Giuliani personally, or just because he's a Republican. I say that is wrong.\"</p> <p>The three other men all expected to compete against Mr Hevesi for the Democratic nomination all rushed to criticise his comments. Yet , while the speech said a lot about Mr Hevesi, it said a lot more about Mr Giuliani and the dilemma facing the Democratic contenders for his throne.</p> <p>Polls consistently show that, while New Yorkers may abhor some of the tough measures taken against the poor or the sick by the mayor, they love the fact that the city has boomed under his tenure. Crime is down, house prices are up, jobs and tourism are booming. Showing similarities with his third-way brothers in Britain, Mr Hevesi even praised the fact that \"the squeegee men are off the streets\" on Tuesday.</p> <p>Significantly, his speech in a Manhattan hotel failed to elicit a response from a largely silent band of supporters.

      "bodyText": "It was an oddly low-key start to an oddly low-key race. The prize was to lead a city that considers itself the centre of the universe and the hotel ballroom was decked with campaign posters. They said \"mebq\". Several observers at the launch of the first official contender in the race to become the mayor of New York looked puzzled, until someone explained that it meant \"most experienced, best qualified\". Alan Hevesi had decided to use his two-term record as a city comptroller - a sort of state accountant - as the basis for his campaign. Of more interest to political observers was the fact that the Democrat also chose to praise the incumbent mayor, a man many of his party believe to be the Antichrist. Mr Hevesi hedged his enthusiasm for Rudy Giuliani but it was there and obvious all the same. \"In large part - not for everyone yet, and not everywhere - our city is going in the right direction,\" he said, after eight years of Giuliani's stewardship. \"Some people want to pretend that's not true: they root for bad things to happen in our city on Rudy's watch becuse they don't like Rudy Giuliani personally, or just because he's a Republican. I say that is wrong.\" The three other men all expected to compete against Mr Hevesi for the Democratic nomination all rushed to criticise his comments. Yet , while the speech said a lot about Mr Hevesi, it said a lot more about Mr Giuliani and the dilemma facing the Democratic contenders for his throne. Polls consistently show that, while New Yorkers may abhor some of the tough measures taken against the poor or the sick by the mayor, they love the fact that the city has boomed under his tenure. Crime is down, house prices are up, jobs and tourism are booming. Showing similarities with his third-way brothers in Britain, Mr Hevesi even praised the fact that \"the squeegee men are off the streets\" on Tuesday. Significantly, his speech in a Manhattan hotel failed to elicit a response from a largely silent band of supporters. Democrat party members, who will elect their candidate in September, two months before the actual election, are far less supportive of Giuliani's means or his ends than the population at large. The four Democratic candidates, all seasoned but fairly lacklustre politicians, must steer a course between this hatred and the public's support for what Giuliani has achieved. Marshall Whittman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, says, \"The spectre of Rudy is haunting this race. Although he isn't on the ballot, he might as well be.\" In many ways, this is the Democratic party's election to lose.

Michael Bloomberg, a man as brash as his rivals are boring, has been a Democrat for most of his life. He is expected to announce his intention to run as the Republican successor to Mr Giuliani before the end of May.

      "body": "<p>A 3.5m-year-old skull unearthed in Kenya could be about to throw the story of human origins into confusion once again.</p> <p>Human lineage has been linked to an ancestral genus called the Australopithecines, creatures closer to modern humans than to modern apes, who roamed the savannahs and the Rift Valley of Africa more than 3m years ago. But a report in Nature today describes a new species - Kenanthropus platyops - with a much flatter face than any Australopithecine.</p> <p>\"Kenyanthropus shows persuasively that at least two lineages existed as far back as 3.5m years,\" said Meave Leakey of the Kenya national museum, who worked with her daughter Louise, Fred Spoor of University College, London, and others to analyse the fragments of fossilised bone.</p> <p>The skull was found at Lake Turkana in Kenya. It shares several features with modern chimpanzees, but has a large, flat face, with high cheeks and small teeth. Teeth size and face shape are linked to the way an animal eats. Researchers think that Kenyanthropus and Australophithecus could have had separate diets, and co-existed peacefully without competing for the same resources.</p> <p>And it once again raises the question: where did humans come from? \"It revolutionises the way we look at human ancestry. We have found a very flat-faced 3.6m-year-old hominid which represents something quite different to what we know to have existed at that time,\" Louise Leakey told Reuters in Nairobi yesterday. \"It doesn't simplify the picture at all. But it does confirm that the evolutionary tree was far more bushy earlier on than we had appreciated.\"</p> <p>Researchers found fossils of more than 30 individuals in 1998 and 1999. The most crucial, however, was the telltale skull of a small-brained, human-looking individual.</p> <p>Humans and chimpanzees shared a common, unknown ancestor who lived in Africa about 5.5m years ago. French anthropologists this year made controversial claims to have found traces of an older link in the human chain, but anthropologists are more sure of fossil fragments of a human-like creature called Ardepithecus from 4.4.m years ago. The next convincing fossils - found widely in central and east Africa - are in the Australopithecus family.

      "bodyText": "A 3.5m-year-old skull unearthed in Kenya could be about to throw the story of human origins into confusion once again. Human lineage has been linked to an ancestral genus called the Australopithecines, creatures closer to modern humans than to modern apes, who roamed the savannahs and the Rift Valley of Africa more than 3m years ago. But a report in Nature today describes a new species - Kenanthropus platyops - with a much flatter face than any Australopithecine. \"Kenyanthropus shows persuasively that at least two lineages existed as far back as 3.5m years,\" said Meave Leakey of the Kenya national museum, who worked with her daughter Louise, Fred Spoor of University College, London, and others to analyse the fragments of fossilised bone. The skull was found at Lake Turkana in Kenya. It shares several features with modern chimpanzees, but has a large, flat face, with high cheeks and small teeth. Teeth size and face shape are linked to the way an animal eats. Researchers think that Kenyanthropus and Australophithecus could have had separate diets, and co-existed peacefully without competing for the same resources. And it once again raises the question: where did humans come from? \"It revolutionises the way we look at human ancestry. We have found a very flat-faced 3.6m-year-old hominid which represents something quite different to what we know to have existed at that time,\" Louise Leakey told Reuters in Nairobi yesterday. \"It doesn't simplify the picture at all. But it does confirm that the evolutionary tree was far more bushy earlier on than we had appreciated.\" Researchers found fossils of more than 30 individuals in 1998 and 1999. The most crucial, however, was the telltale skull of a small-brained, human-looking individual. Humans and chimpanzees shared a common, unknown ancestor who lived in Africa about 5.5m years ago. French anthropologists this year made controversial claims to have found traces of an older link in the human chain, but anthropologists are more sure of fossil fragments of a human-like creature called Ardepithecus from 4.4.m years ago. The next convincing fossils - found widely in central and east Africa - are in the Australopithecus family. One line from this family was believed to have evolved into the genus Homo between 3m and 2m years ago, with modern Homo sapiens the only survivors. But the new find has muddied this clear picture. \"It now seems clear that between 3.5m and 2m years ago there were several human-like species, which were well adapted to life in different environments,\" said Daniel Lieberman of George Washington University, writing in Nature. \"It will be quite a while before we can confidently determine the position of Kenyanthropus platyops in the human evolutionary tree.\"",

As we see in increasingly dramatic ways, such as the spread of species that are more resistant to antibiotics and herbicides, monocultures are vulnerable.

But state schools are concerned that they are being burdened with a promise to relieve France's sense of linguistic incompetence without sufficient resources to see the policy through.</p> <p>Last June Mr Lang announced a package of reforms aimed at lowering the age at which children start learning a second or foreign language - from age six by 2004 and from age five by 2005. But in January the minister announced that he was speeding up his policy by bringing forward the start of language classes for six-year-olds to the 2001-2002 school year, starting this autumn. He also announced the introduction of a new test of pupils language skills when they enter their first year of coll\u00e8ge (at 11).</p> <p>These policies are linked to a widespread perception among the public that the French are bad at languages, and that the quality of language training currently on offer in school is poor. Ask anyone in France if they think language learning in school is satisfactory and the answer is likely to be negative. Nevertheless, more than 50% of the population believe they can use a foreign language comfortably. For those uncomfortable with a foreign language, class size, unrealistic syllabuses, a lack of resources and, more than anything else, a late start are all likely to be blamed. </p> <p>Mr Lang's reforms are only the latest in a series of government initiatives to improve language teaching. Since 1998 students have had the opportunity to begin learning a foreign language at the age of 10 (in 2000, 85% did so in their last year of primary school. Learning a first foreign language is mandatory at 11, and a second language is introduced at 13. Moreover pupils can pick from as many as 14 languages, 75% of them take two languages through their last year of school, and 12% try their hand at three languages. </p> <p>Mr Lang has portrayed his drive for multilingualism as a necessary challenge for French national identity. He has also pointed out that far from being a monolingual country, France is enriched by speakers numerous regional languages, such as Basque, Occitan, Catalan and Corse, and the new policy officially acknowledges these languages. </p> <p>Studying a second language from as early as five-years-old would represent, in Mr Lang's words, \"an efficient way of forging a link between the pupil's culture and other surrounding cultures\". Multilingualism is also seen as an antidote to the dominance of English: already a staggering 88% of pupils at coll\u00e8ge elect to study English as their first foreign language, while German is chosen by only 11%, with other languages such as Spanish and Italian lagging far behind. </p> <p>But not everyone is won over by la r\u00e9forme, and it has drawn wide-ranging criticism. Some are claiming that the policy is aimed at bolstering Mr Lang's popularity in the run up to next year's national elections. </p> <p>Others are prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. Laurent Quintard, vice-secretary general of SNUIPP, the primary school teachers' union, supports Mr Lang's multilingual principals, but adds, \"Once again we have to point out the discrepancy between the measures announced and the resources the minister wants to deploy. It is not enough to make foreign languages mandatory if schools have no qualified teachers.\"</p> <p>Because teacher training is notoriously expensive, previous ministers of education have tried to meet their commitments to language education by using teachers with little competence in the target language - and in many cases with no specific training.</p> <p>Jacqueline Quienart, a primary schoolteacher and past president of TESOL France explains how this system works. \"At the moment three types of teachers are doing the job: language assistants, people from outside the school, like parents, coll\u00e8ge teachers doing overtime (on average 1 to 5 hours a week) or primary schoolteachers accredited to teach a second language,\" she says, \"But in the latter case, the teaching skills are not actually tested.\" </p> <p>\"We can no longer rely on those willing to work on a volunteer basis,\" adds Mr Quintard, \"so obviously an effort has to be made to train the teachers.\" In response Mr Lang has said that he will recruit a sufficient number of teachers with language skills by 2003. He has also announced that he will have 1,850 language assistants in place for the beginning of the 2002 academic year, up from 1,000 this year. </p> <p>Teachers and teacher trainers are also sceptical about the assumption that young children can pick up a second, or even a third language, effortlessly. \"The younger the better does not necessarily seem the case,\" says Line Audin, an English teacher at the National Institute for Teacher Research. \"Despite it being very attractive and popular in France, this formula fails to distinguish between what's learnt at a very young age, and what's learnt later.\" </p> <p>Researchers agree that exposing young children to a foreign language provides them with a window on different cultures early on in life, but there is no consensus on whether this exposure promotes better and faster language acquisition. </p> <p>Many teachers also fear that implementing the new policy will actually end up reinforcing the dominance of English, the very thing crticised by the minister, who is fond of saying that if he were a dictator, \"I'd probably ban English from primary school\".</p>",

Teachers and teacher trainers are also sceptical about the assumption that young children can pick up a second, or even a third language, effortlessly. \"The younger the better does not necessarily seem the case,\" says Line Audin, an English teacher at the National Institute for Teacher Research. \"Despite it being very attractive and popular in France, this formula fails to distinguish between what's learnt at a very young age, and what's learnt later.\" Researchers agree that exposing young children to a foreign language provides them with a window on different cultures early on in life, but there is no consensus on whether this exposure promotes better and faster language acquisition. Many teachers also fear that implementing the new policy will actually end up reinforcing the dominance of English, the very thing crticised by the minister, who is fond of saying that if he were a dictator, \"I'd probably ban English from primary school\".",

Mr Tomlinson explained later that with many parts of the countryside now out of bounds, exam boards and the qualifications and curriculum authority were holding urgent discussions about the potential impact of the restrictions on schools, colleges and their pupils. Although he admitted it was \"an emerging issue\", he said it would be wrong to \"talk it up into a crisis\". \"Of course, the worry then is how that will impact on their overall grades.

Inspectors had already been given guidance not go into areas declared off limits to visitors, and two school inspections had had to be deferred because of the outbreak. Mr Tomlinson was giving evidence to the all party Commons committee during one of two annual sessions by which parliament holds Ofsted to account. It was the first time he had appeared before the committee since taking over from his controversial predecessor Chris Woodhead. The Joint Council for General Qualifications, which represents the examining boards, said it was taking the issue of foot and mouth disease seriously and had published guidance to schools on fieldwork restrictions earlier this month. It admitted that an increasing number of field centres were cancelling courses, while fieldwork being organised by individual schools and colleges was also being affected. Where course work had to be submitted for this year's exams, \"in many cases it will be possible to carry out appropriate work in the local area, or even on the school site itself\", the guidance said. The JCGQ said that figures on the number of candidates taking the exams were not yet available. However, last year 37,112 pupils took geography at A-level and 251,605 at GCSE, while for biology there were 54,840 candidates for A-level and 48,715 for GCSE. What's going on?

      "bodyText": "Job satisfaction among Britain's 6m public sector workers has fallen sharply over the past decade as rising levels of stress have made work less enjoyable for doctors, nurses, teachers, lecturers and civil servants, said research published yesterday. The study from Andrew Oswald and Jonathan Gardner of Warwick University found that an increase in depression, strain, sleep loss and unhappiness during the 1990s had made employment more pressurised and less enjoyable in the public realm. While public sector workers began the 1990s with far higher levels of job satisfaction than those in the private sector, the Warwick University research showed that this gap had been virtually eroded by 1998, which was a year of stringent control of government spending. \"We expect these trends to continue. I anticipate that things have got worse in the years to 2001, judging by the information we have been able to glean from other sources,\" Professor Oswald said. \"I think this is very serious for Britain. Job satisfaction has dropped dramatically in the public sector throughout the 90s. Stress has risen quite dramatically.\" Prof Oswald said his view was that the decline in job satisfaction was linked to rising stress. \"The very heavy increase in workloads in the public sector has made workers much less happy\", he said. The Guardian this week carried interviews with more than 200 workers from all parts of the public sector. Prof Oswald said that it was clear from the responses that those who chose jobs in the public sector did so because they were attracted by the \"intrinsically interesting nature\" of the work. \"Our evidence suggests that job satisfaction premium has collapsed.\" All groups of public sector workers have become less satisfied at work over the past decade, a period in which they have faced extra bureaucracy, pressure to meet targets as well as the introduction of working practices from the private sector. The steady decline in satisfaction was particularly evident in the NHS, higher education and those working for local government. The sample of 5,000 workers was re-interviewed each year through the 1990s, with stress levels assessed by the answers to 12 standard questions used to measure mental distress and psychological ill health. Overall, the researchers found that job satisfaction was u-shaped in age, with initial contentment at work during teenage years disappearing by the age of 25. Job satisfaction was lowest when people were in their 20s and 30s - the period when people struggle to balance work with their family commitments - and highest among staff in their 50s and 60s. Recorded job satisfaction was higher among women than among men, lower among blacks than whites, slightly lower in union workplaces than non-union ones, high in small workplaces, and highest of all in not-for-profit organisations. The self-employed also said that they enjoyed their work, according to theWarwick University research. Measured by educational attainment, the study found that those workers with no qualifications were most satisfied with their jobs. \"It is Britons with university degrees, surprisingly, who report the lowest levels of satisfaction at work\", Prof Oswald said.",

      "body": "<p>\"We\u0092re going to have long grass where children can run and jump and hide. Children have a right to play without treading on condoms and syringes.\" Margy Whalley, research director at Pen Green centre for under-fives and their families in the former steeltown of Corby, waves her hands like a conjuror over a plain architect\u0092s model of a planned new extension to the centre\u0092s battered 1930s building.</p> <p>A government cash injection of \u00a33.3m will create not only new facilities for babies, toddlers and teenage parents (commoner than average in the struggling Northamptonshire town), but a grassy enclosed play area where children can rampage about in safety.</p> <p>Pen Green, housed in the old brick comprehensive school built to serve the children of Corby\u0092s original steelworkers, is the base for two of the initiatives boasted of most proudly by a Labour government stung that its public sector successes rarely win the attention afforded to its failures. The centre, founded in 1983 \u0096 just after the steelworks closed \u0096 and quietly making a difference for local families ever since, has been granted early excellence centre status and funds in recognition of its work providing both quality childcare and support for the jobless and low-income families of the area.</p> <p>More recently, the centre has also become home to, and main partner in, one of the trailblazing first tranche of the government\u0092s Sure Start projects \u0096 aimed at providing better services of all kinds for children under four and their families. For the buggy-pushing parents flooding in and out of Pen Green and its two outposts on estates across the town, the catchy labels invented by Labour\u0092s policy wonks may have little meaning. </p> <p>But for Dr Whalley and her colleagues, that is as it should be: the aim of Sure Start, in particular, is to ensure families receive a seamless service of parenting help, health care and advice, childcare and other support without falling through the gaps between competing or conflicting agencies.</p> <p>For the government, Sure Start epitomises efforts to shake up public service performance by combining highly tailored local delivery with centralised standard-setting: often skirting traditional powerbases such as local authorities in the process. Local councils are highly involved in the Corby project and its fellow 60 pioneering Sure Start schemes around the country, but are obliged to cooperate with other agencies and work towards nationally set targets.The ex-steel town, the subject of a scattergun array of aid projects in the 1980s, already boasts a history of collaboration between public and voluntary sector agencies. </p> <p>The most successful example of other flagship government initiatives \u0097 such as early years development and childcare partnerships, designed to incorporate childcare provision and tailor it to local needs \u0096 demonstrates similar collaborative approaches, but elsewhere years of competitive grant-bidding have provoked rifts instead. Here is where Downing Street wants Whitehall to bash heads together and where its dreams of a new form of delivery will be tested. </p> <p>\"At the beginning, people kept saying this way of working is going to open up a can of worms,\" Dr Whalley says. \"But opening cans of worms is what this has been about, and that\u0092s why we\u0092ve had such a high level of parental involvement.\" </p> <p>The list of partners involved in the Corby Sure Start, from the Pen Green Centre to Northants county council, social services and the health authority to local schools and childminders, is enough to make the eyes glaze over with agency fatigue. The difference from past initiatives, however, is the prime role played by parents, who themselves conducted the initial survey asking what was needed.</p> <p><strong>Childcare gaps </strong></p> <p>The research found that, for the 898 families with children under four in the project\u0092s catchment area, priorities included local and accessible facilities to allow parents with young children to meet, play, study and take a break from home pressures.</p> <p>The study also identified gaps in childcare, aggravated by the nine different shift patterns practised by the factories such as Weetabix, Asda and Finnegans Famous Cakes whose low-paid agency jobs have replaced steel manufacturing. Family life for youngsters was found to be pockmarked by major illness, change of address or job, divorce, unemployment or parental access problems, while health problems, child mortality and domestic violence were all significantly above the national average.</p> <p>The consultation was vital, according to project manager Bernie Caffrey, if Sure Start was to be more than another welfare sticking plaster. \"Sure Start is working when parents don\u0092t feel they are being \u0091done to\u0092, that they are just recipients of welfare state handouts, but that they and their community have ownership of what is going on.\" </p> <p>The results of the process include daily drop-in sessions with play activities for children and advice for parents on parenting and child behaviour; respite care for 80 families; \"baby matters\" groups with baby massage, clinics and discussions; a safety equipment loan scheme; reading, story-telling and computing sessions; and weekly advice sessions covering legal help, housing, welfare and services for children with special needs.</p> <p>All are offered not only at Pen Green but at newly opened satellite centres in a house and flat on two Corby estates beset by crime, drug problems and vandalism. At Wick Close House, opened in January 2000, one drop-in session is punctuated by the whoops of toddlers pedalling round the yard and others miraculously demanding the healthy fruit and cracker snacks on offer. Mothers, including 33-year-old Rachel Walker, whose five children range from 15 to one, can all recite by heart the text of one children\u0092s book, \"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you hear?\"</p> <p>\"I\u0092d be lost without this place, really,\" says Rachel, a daily inhabitant of the Wick Close sofa who got educational support for her autistic son with the help of staff at the centre. \"The kids went on a trip to the seaside and it was the first time they had seen the sea. They love the reading, the toys \u0096 I think they like the snacks best.\" At Ripley Walk, a flat also equipped with toys and comfortable armchairs, lone parent Stef Joseph \u0096 studying to be a creche worker with Sure Start encouragement \u0096 enthuses: \"The centre is brilliant, it\u0092s like a second home. I\u0092ve met neighbours here I never met without it.\"</p> <p><strong>Breadline wages</strong></p> <p>The parents' - and workers' - enthusiasm is genuine, though the alleviation of the poverty affecting their children must depend as much on the breadline wages paid by many local employers as on the help even well-funded support services can give. Sure Start can help harness parents' aspirations through their children, but it is difficult to see how those youngsters will ultimately move out of the poverty trap without other interventions to boost employment and training.</p> <p>For those running the government's programmes, the strength of the latest initiatives is that they build on existing successes ground down over the under-funded Tory years. </p> <p>Trevor Chandler, head of the Pen Green centre, points to its track record of integrating its services and listening to parents, saying: \"The government initiatives have helped us develop what we were doing anyway, allowing us to do it in a more comprehensive way.\" </p> <p>Whether or not the government gets the credit it deserves, the pressure to make the programmes work is huge. Despite the efforts of numerous agencies and so many past aid programmes residents are experience \"zone fatigue\", Corby is still struggling. </p> <p>\"We are not going to get this money again if we don't make it work this time,\" says Dr Whalley. \"It has got to be grounded in what the community wants.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"We\u0092re going to have long grass where children can run and jump and hide. Children have a right to play without treading on condoms and syringes.\" Margy Whalley, research director at Pen Green centre for under-fives and their families in the former steeltown of Corby, waves her hands like a conjuror over a plain architect\u0092s model of a planned new extension to the centre\u0092s battered 1930s building. A government cash injection of \u00a33.3m will create not only new facilities for babies, toddlers and teenage parents (commoner than average in the struggling Northamptonshire town), but a grassy enclosed play area where children can rampage about in safety. Pen Green, housed in the old brick comprehensive school built to serve the children of Corby\u0092s original steelworkers, is the base for two of the initiatives boasted of most proudly by a Labour government stung that its public sector successes rarely win the attention afforded to its failures. The centre, founded in 1983 \u0096 just after the steelworks closed \u0096 and quietly making a difference for local families ever since, has been granted early excellence centre status and funds in recognition of its work providing both quality childcare and support for the jobless and low-income families of the area. More recently, the centre has also become home to, and main partner in, one of the trailblazing first tranche of the government\u0092s Sure Start projects \u0096 aimed at providing better services of all kinds for children under four and their families. For the buggy-pushing parents flooding in and out of Pen Green and its two outposts on estates across the town, the catchy labels invented by Labour\u0092s policy wonks may have little meaning. But for Dr Whalley and her colleagues, that is as it should be: the aim of Sure Start, in particular, is to ensure families receive a seamless service of parenting help, health care and advice, childcare and other support without falling through the gaps between competing or conflicting agencies. For the government, Sure Start epitomises efforts to shake up public service performance by combining highly tailored local delivery with centralised standard-setting: often skirting traditional powerbases such as local authorities in the process. Local councils are highly involved in the Corby project and its fellow 60 pioneering Sure Start schemes around the country, but are obliged to cooperate with other agencies and work towards nationally set targets.The ex-steel town, the subject of a scattergun array of aid projects in the 1980s, already boasts a history of collaboration between public and voluntary sector agencies. The most successful example of other flagship government initiatives \u0097 such as early years development and childcare partnerships, designed to incorporate childcare provision and tailor it to local needs \u0096 demonstrates similar collaborative approaches, but elsewhere years of competitive grant-bidding have provoked rifts instead. Here is where Downing Street wants Whitehall to bash heads together and where its dreams of a new form of delivery will be tested. \"At the beginning, people kept saying this way of working is going to open up a can of worms,\" Dr Whalley says. \"But opening cans of worms is what this has been about, and that\u0092s why we\u0092ve had such a high level of parental involvement.\" The list of partners involved in the Corby Sure Start, from the Pen Green Centre to Northants county council, social services and the health authority to local schools and childminders, is enough to make the eyes glaze over with agency fatigue. The difference from past initiatives, however, is the prime role played by parents, who themselves conducted the initial survey asking what was needed. Childcare gaps The research found that, for the 898 families with children under four in the project\u0092s catchment area, priorities included local and accessible facilities to allow parents with young children to meet, play, study and take a break from home pressures. The study also identified gaps in childcare, aggravated by the nine different shift patterns practised by the factories such as Weetabix, Asda and Finnegans Famous Cakes whose low-paid agency jobs have replaced steel manufacturing. Family life for youngsters was found to be pockmarked by major illness, change of address or job, divorce, unemployment or parental access problems, while health problems, child mortality and domestic violence were all significantly above the national average. The consultation was vital, according to project manager Bernie Caffrey, if Sure Start was to be more than another welfare sticking plaster. \"Sure Start is working when parents don\u0092t feel they are being \u0091done to\u0092, that they are just recipients of welfare state handouts, but that they and their community have ownership of what is going on.\" The results of the process include daily drop-in sessions with play activities for children and advice for parents on parenting and child behaviour; respite care for 80 families; \"baby matters\" groups with baby massage, clinics and discussions; a safety equipment loan scheme; reading, story-telling and computing sessions; and weekly advice sessions covering legal help, housing, welfare and services for children with special needs. All are offered not only at Pen Green but at newly opened satellite centres in a house and flat on two Corby estates beset by crime, drug problems and vandalism. At Wick Close House, opened in January 2000, one drop-in session is punctuated by the whoops of toddlers pedalling round the yard and others miraculously demanding the healthy fruit and cracker snacks on offer. Mothers, including 33-year-old Rachel Walker, whose five children range from 15 to one, can all recite by heart the text of one children\u0092s book, \"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you hear?\" \"I\u0092d be lost without this place, really,\" says Rachel, a daily inhabitant of the Wick Close sofa who got educational support for her autistic son with the help of staff at the centre. \"The kids went on a trip to the seaside and it was the first time they had seen the sea. They love the reading, the toys \u0096 I think they like the snacks best.\" At Ripley Walk, a flat also equipped with toys and comfortable armchairs, lone parent Stef Joseph \u0096 studying to be a creche worker with Sure Start encouragement \u0096 enthuses: \"The centre is brilliant, it\u0092s like a second home. I\u0092ve met neighbours here I never met without it.\" Breadline wages The parents' - and workers' - enthusiasm is genuine, though the alleviation of the poverty affecting their children must depend as much on the breadline wages paid by many local employers as on the help even well-funded support services can give. Sure Start can help harness parents' aspirations through their children, but it is difficult to see how those youngsters will ultimately move out of the poverty trap without other interventions to boost employment and training. For those running the government's programmes, the strength of the latest initiatives is that they build on existing successes ground down over the under-funded Tory years. Trevor Chandler, head of the Pen Green centre, points to its track record of integrating its services and listening to parents, saying: \"The government initiatives have helped us develop what we were doing anyway, allowing us to do it in a more comprehensive way.\" Whether or not the government gets the credit it deserves, the pressure to make the programmes work is huge. Despite the efforts of numerous agencies and so many past aid programmes residents are experience \"zone fatigue\", Corby is still struggling. \"We are not going to get this money again if we don't make it work this time,\" says Dr Whalley. \"It has got to be grounded in what the community wants.\"",

      "bodyText": "A case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in the Irish Republic today for the first time since the outbreak started in Britain. Officials from the department of agriculture across the border in Northern Ireland were engaged in emergency talks today as evidence of the disease was confirmed in County Louth. It had been hoped that restrictions on the movement of animals could be eased given the length of time elapsed since Northern Ireland's single case of the disease was uncovered at a farm in south Armagh. But today's confirmation falls within the surveillance zone around the farm at Meigh. Irish agriculture minister Brid Rodgers was expected to brief the Stormont executive on the developments later today. It comes as a severe blow to a country which had desperately battled to remain disease-free. As well as banning major sporting fixtures on home soil, the Irish government also banned horseracing teams from travelling to Britain and has been openly critical of Britain's handling of the crisis. The Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, told the country's parliament: \"I have to inform the House that the results of two of the tests have proved positive. This is a major disappointment, given the intensity of efforts of all sections of society here to keep the disease out of Ireland.\" He said the outbreak - at Jenkinstown, close to the Co Louth border with Northern Ireland - meant the republic had to prepare as soon as possible on how to handle the disease at national level. Opposition parties in the Dail pledged full support for all government efforts to combat the disease. In Britain, the number of cases stood at 435 overnight with 40 more cases confirmed yesterday. The environment minister, Michael Meacher, warned the disease may run into May and beyond. The first cull of apparently healthy animals took place today. Around 1,300 animals at a farm at Dornock, near Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, were taken to a disinfected slaughterhouse where they were being killed on the grounds that they were within two miles of an infected farm. \u0095 Farmers have been warned to beware of possible letterbomb attacks by animal welfare extremists enraged by the cull of healthy animals. The National Farmers' Union has circulated the warning through its regional offices. \"They're telling us to be aware of any unexpected packages which may arrive, and not to open them if we have any doubts. It seems they have been told that anyone speaking out in favour of the cordon sanitaire operation could be getting some unwelcome attention,\" said Marilyn Ivings, an Oxfordshire farmer. The warning does not appear to be based on specific threats by militants, or on police intelligence, but rather on a general fear that the crisis has inflamed opinion. \"Obviously with the cull going on, some animal activists don't support it, so we have been telling our people to be on the lookout,\" said a spokeswoman.

The redundancies come on top of measures already taken by the household goods giant to streamline its operations to focus on core brands.

      "bodyText": "The BBC says it has been given written assurances by the production company behind next week's BBC1 documentary featuring Reggie Kray's last interview that no licence fee money will go to relatives of the legendary gangster. The corporation was responding to fierce criticism following reports it has paid up to \u00a3280,000 for a documentary that includes a \"revelatory\" death-bed interview with Kray. Kray, who died last year of cancer, had been approached directly by several broadcasters for a final interview. These included ITV, which was interested in doing a Tonight special report on the east end criminal. The BBC deal has also become embroiled in controversy because the documentary is executive produced by Bill Curbishley, a friend of Reggie's widow, Roberta Kray. Reggie Kray - The Final Word, which is due to go out next Thursday on BBC1, has been made by independent producer Mission Television. \"Mission have confirmed in writing to us that no money was paid to Reggie or Roberta,\" a BBC spokeswoman said. BBC producer guidelines allow for the payment of disturbance fees, which involve sums usually not exceeding \u00a3400, to cover the costs and lost earnings of people contributing to documentaries. But the BBC spokeswoman insisted the Krays had not even received this payment. \"Reggie and Roberta were paid nothing - not even a disturbance fee.\" However, she did not know the details of the contract for Mr Curbishley, who arranged the deathbed interview with Reggie and took it to Mission TV. Mr Curbishley served a prison sentence in the 1960s for armed robbery before moving into the music business. The spokeswoman could not comment on whether he had been paid. But the spokeswoman stressed that while he would have an executive producer credit for the documentary Mr Curbishley had not had editorial control over its content. \"He had no editorial involvement in the content of programme,\" the spokeswoman said. \"He is credited as an executive producer in the contract because he set up the interview.\" The film's executive producer is deputy controller of documentaries and investigations David Mortimer. \"He has editorial responsibility for the film,\" the spokeswoman said. She added that reports that the BBC paid \u00a3280,000 to Mission TV for the Kray documentary were \"on the high side\".

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Gopi Warrier is taking my pulse. We are speeding along in the back of a car, Regent's Park is blurring past, brilliant in the February sunshine. Do I like hot or cold weather, he asks. How do I feel if I have missed my lunch? Or if I'm too hot? What sort of illnesses do I suffer? Am I close to my family? Warrier, chairman of the Ayurvedic Company in Great Britain, is trying to assess my dosha, in a casual, lunchtime sort of a way. He concludes I am vata-kapha. </p> <p>It's nice to know one has a dosha: they are, after all, this season's must-have accessory. The sort of clutch-bag of the medical world. Madonna, Demi Moore and Gemma Kidd have all been flaunting theirs. The doe-eyed supermodel Christy Turlington has even launched Sundari, a beauty range based on Ayurveda. </p> <p>Warrier looks appalled by the sudden Ayurveda hysteria. He would rather it were not treated as the latest item on the cosmetic counter to be listed in the stockists pages of Vogue and Cosmo, alongside anti-cellulite creams and bio-thermal wraps. He raises his head a little defiantly. \"Ayurveda should be sacred and noble, not practised by beauty therapists on the high street,\" he says. </p> <p>Ayurveda, indeed, has a sacred and noble history. Part of the Vedas, the divine texts of Hinduism, it dates back 3,500 to 4,000 years, and is deemed to be the world's oldest complete medical system. Ayurveda's literal translation is \"the science of life\", and its aim is not only to treat ailments symptomatically but to prevent illness and sustain life. Its roots are intertwined with those of yoga and meditation, and both play a fundamental role in ayurvedic treatment. </p> <p>The essential belief of Ayurveda is that the entire universe, from stag beetles to tea roses, is made up of five elements: air, fire, water, earth and ether - collectively termed panchamahabhutas - and the three doshas: vata, pitta and kapha. The theory is that we can achieve perfect health by balancing the three within ourselves. </p> <p>The three doshas are, apparently, like ingredients or humours, although Warrier says that the ayurvedic notion of humours pre-dates that of the Greeks. Doshas dictate everything about us, from the colour of our hair to the type of illnesses we suffer. They are even responsible for the foods we crave, our relationships and the things we like to do. We all contain elements of vata, pitta and kapha, but generally we have one - or sometimes two - dominant doshas. </p> <p>Roughly speaking, vata corresponds to air, pitta is fire and kapha is water. Vata's physiological role is said to be related to the body's energy and nervous system; pitta governs digestion and metabolism; kapha oversees phlegm, moisture and lymphatics. Exacerbation of a particular dosha, through eating the wrong foods or living the wrong physical or emotional lifestyle, will lead to illness. </p> <p>Taking the pulse is the key to determining your dosha. The physician will examine the radial artery pulse, found at the root of the thumb, and, if healthy, it will seem strong and regular. Ayurvedic practitioners compare the unhealthy pulse to the movements of particular creatures. A vata pulse resembles the path of a snake, swift and thread-like; the pitta pulse is frog-like and erratic; the kapha pulse is at a deeper, swan-like pace. </p> <p>In July, the first ayurvedic hospital outside India opened in Stamford Brook, west London. Since then, Warrier says, it has received more than 100,000 inquiries, and has treated more than 500 people. Admission generally requires a letter from a GP, but Warrier says that it is increasingly treating people who have found the hospital of their own accord. He estimates that treatments cost between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 a day, not counting additional costs such as food and board. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the Ayurvedic hospital, therefore, is that it operates as a charity, providing treatment free of charge. </p> <p>At present there are 30 beds in the hospital, with seven ayurvedic physicians, three western GPs and six therapists in attendance. It offers treatments such as shirodhara (herbal oil dripped on to the head), vasti (enema using medicated oils) and abhangya (herbal body massage) for all manner of complaints including skin diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression. A typical ayurvedic assessment would include an initial diagnosis. Subsequent treatment might include herbal medicines, massage, steam bath or even detox by panchakarma. </p> <p>Warrier believes that ayurvedic products should only be available from established manufacturers, and lambasts western herbal companies that sell products he says that have no clinical or toxicological proof of effectiveness. \"If champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France, then ayurvedic medicines should only come from the parts of the world which have traditionally practised Ayurveda.

      "bodyText": "Gopi Warrier is taking my pulse. We are speeding along in the back of a car, Regent's Park is blurring past, brilliant in the February sunshine. Do I like hot or cold weather, he asks. How do I feel if I have missed my lunch? Or if I'm too hot? What sort of illnesses do I suffer? Am I close to my family? Warrier, chairman of the Ayurvedic Company in Great Britain, is trying to assess my dosha, in a casual, lunchtime sort of a way. He concludes I am vata-kapha. It's nice to know one has a dosha: they are, after all, this season's must-have accessory. The sort of clutch-bag of the medical world. Madonna, Demi Moore and Gemma Kidd have all been flaunting theirs. The doe-eyed supermodel Christy Turlington has even launched Sundari, a beauty range based on Ayurveda. Warrier looks appalled by the sudden Ayurveda hysteria. He would rather it were not treated as the latest item on the cosmetic counter to be listed in the stockists pages of Vogue and Cosmo, alongside anti-cellulite creams and bio-thermal wraps. He raises his head a little defiantly. \"Ayurveda should be sacred and noble, not practised by beauty therapists on the high street,\" he says. Ayurveda, indeed, has a sacred and noble history. Part of the Vedas, the divine texts of Hinduism, it dates back 3,500 to 4,000 years, and is deemed to be the world's oldest complete medical system. Ayurveda's literal translation is \"the science of life\", and its aim is not only to treat ailments symptomatically but to prevent illness and sustain life. Its roots are intertwined with those of yoga and meditation, and both play a fundamental role in ayurvedic treatment. The essential belief of Ayurveda is that the entire universe, from stag beetles to tea roses, is made up of five elements: air, fire, water, earth and ether - collectively termed panchamahabhutas - and the three doshas: vata, pitta and kapha. The theory is that we can achieve perfect health by balancing the three within ourselves. The three doshas are, apparently, like ingredients or humours, although Warrier says that the ayurvedic notion of humours pre-dates that of the Greeks. Doshas dictate everything about us, from the colour of our hair to the type of illnesses we suffer. They are even responsible for the foods we crave, our relationships and the things we like to do. We all contain elements of vata, pitta and kapha, but generally we have one - or sometimes two - dominant doshas. Roughly speaking, vata corresponds to air, pitta is fire and kapha is water. Vata's physiological role is said to be related to the body's energy and nervous system; pitta governs digestion and metabolism; kapha oversees phlegm, moisture and lymphatics. Exacerbation of a particular dosha, through eating the wrong foods or living the wrong physical or emotional lifestyle, will lead to illness. Taking the pulse is the key to determining your dosha. The physician will examine the radial artery pulse, found at the root of the thumb, and, if healthy, it will seem strong and regular. Ayurvedic practitioners compare the unhealthy pulse to the movements of particular creatures. A vata pulse resembles the path of a snake, swift and thread-like; the pitta pulse is frog-like and erratic; the kapha pulse is at a deeper, swan-like pace. In July, the first ayurvedic hospital outside India opened in Stamford Brook, west London. Since then, Warrier says, it has received more than 100,000 inquiries, and has treated more than 500 people. Admission generally requires a letter from a GP, but Warrier says that it is increasingly treating people who have found the hospital of their own accord. He estimates that treatments cost between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 a day, not counting additional costs such as food and board. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the Ayurvedic hospital, therefore, is that it operates as a charity, providing treatment free of charge. At present there are 30 beds in the hospital, with seven ayurvedic physicians, three western GPs and six therapists in attendance. It offers treatments such as shirodhara (herbal oil dripped on to the head), vasti (enema using medicated oils) and abhangya (herbal body massage) for all manner of complaints including skin diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression. A typical ayurvedic assessment would include an initial diagnosis. Subsequent treatment might include herbal medicines, massage, steam bath or even detox by panchakarma. Warrier believes that ayurvedic products should only be available from established manufacturers, and lambasts western herbal companies that sell products he says that have no clinical or toxicological proof of effectiveness. \"If champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France, then ayurvedic medicines should only come from the parts of the world which have traditionally practised Ayurveda. Ayurvedic practitioners should be properly trained, otherwise it is the theft of an intellectual property and exploitation of a developing country.\" This is Warrier's other bugbear. In India, ayurvedic doctors must obtain a university degree to qualify. \"In the west you get a lot of charlatans,\" he says. \"People who go to India for a massage and come back claiming to be ayurvedic therapists.\" To this end, a three-year BA in ayurvedic studies has been launched at Thames Valley University.

Have you any advice?</strong> </p> <p>For those who don't know, the symptoms you refer to are pain when passing urine, a strong urge to urinate frequently, pain when ejaculating and generalised pelvic pain felt in, around and above the penis, and deep inside the back passage. Any man can have a one-off bout, usually due to a urinary tract infection in which bugs from the bladder get into the prostate. This is an acute bacterial prostatitis, and can be cleared up with antibiotics. </p> <p>If you're very prone to recurrent urinary tract infections or your immunity is impaired, you may get several bouts of prostatitis (aka chronic bacterial prostatitis); each time there will be bacteria in your urine and antibiotics will work. Bacterial prostatitis is, however, quite rare. Far commoner is chronic pelvic pain syndrome, in which there are no bacteria in your urine or prostate but the same upsetting symptoms. Antibiotics don't usually work. The prostate gland is inflamed, probably because urine refluxes into it. Hot baths and ejaculating often help. </p> <p>Drugs that help to shrink enlarged prostates (eg finasteride) and painkillers are worth a try. Treatments ranging from pollen extract pills to microwaving the prostate via a probe inserted through the penis have been tried. No method is guaranteed to work, but seeing a urologist who specialises in prostatitis will allow you to discuss these and other options. </p> <p><strong> Hot and bothered</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>This may sound like a trivial complaint, but I am completely unable to cope with being hot. If I do anything physically exerting - or even simply walk about in temperatures over 19C - my face goes very dark purple and sweats profusely. This has been a source of embarrassment and discomfort to me all my life. I have left at least one job on account of the heat, and have never felt able to travel in hot countries. Is this likely to be connected with my eczema and asthma? And can you suggest any solution apart from dabbing myself with peppermint oil, which doesn't work?</strong> </p> <p>Some people do sweat more than others. We all sweat more in the heat and when we exert ourselves because the evaporation of sweat from our skin is one of the body's cooling devices. Being overweight and having a high metabolic rate, which may be due to an overactive thyroid, make us sweat more. Anxiety or a hot curry can also make you sweat. It's not connected to your asthma and eczema and I'm not sure that peppermint oil works. </p> <p>Sweat doesn't smell, but bacteria break it down and liberate the pungent smells of BO. Stay cool by avoiding hot places and wearing loose cotton clothes. Avoid pungent foods, which can be smelled in sweat, and use an ordinary antiperspirant at least twice a day. Consider shaving your armpits, as the hair traps sweat. </p> <p>The next line of attack is to use one of the stronger antiperspirants containing 4.2% aluminium chloride (eg Drichlor or Perspirex), which are best applied at night. If the sweating is still unmanageable, you can be referred for specialist treatment including botulism toxin injections or, in the most extreme cases, consider a major operation called a sympathectomy, which prevents control sweating. </p> <p><strong> Walking miracle</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>If I go to the gym and walk (which I enjoy) instead of jogging (which I hate), how much further do I have to walk to get the same amount of exercise as a three-mile jog?</strong> </p> <p>You're going to be very pleased by this answer. You actually burn up more calories by walking at 8km/h (5mph) than by jogging slowly at the same pace, according to a recent study. Admittedly, you do have to walk quite fast to save yourself from falling off the end of the treadmill if you set it to that speed, but it's got to be better than jogging and jiggling about. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

      "body": "<p>\"Have You Asked About Laser Assisted Hatching?\" The notice hangs over the leather sofa, between the marble busts and overlarge arrangement of dried flowers. Tasselled curtains frame a mighty stone fireplace in which flickers a fake fire. All is the quiet of soft furnishings. </p> <p>Then into this calm scuttles our protagonist, a small silver-haired gentleman, with baby-pink puffy skin that seems as if it has never seen the sun. He is dressed in what could be his old school uniform - a red striped tie, maroon sweater and permacrease trousers - and waves a blue spotted handkerchief. \"Can I be of assistance to you?\" he begs, his leather-gloved hands hovering eagerly over my hugely pregnant belly. Then, sensing my alarm and presuming it's to do with the gloves, he adds, \"I have some rubber ones as well.\" </p> <p>The great advantage, he explains, is that he - Professor Ian Craft - is one of the few obstetricians who do their own epidurals: \"I could do yours.\" I hope he's joking. I am here, after all, as a journalist, even if a heavily pregnant one. \"Natural conception?\" he asks. \"Well ...\" I stutter. </p> <p>The small crowd in the waiting room are stony-faced. There's the infertile patient with her sister, whose hand she is holding tightly, as if to prevent her tumbling from the soft leather sofa. There's the egg donor with her mother, both extremely overweight. And there's the professor, who hurries me through to a larger room next door, with rather nice flock wallpaper, where a bench is lined with a row of fearsome-looking instruments, all metal, all sharp. If it wasn't for the Assisted Hatching notice, we could be characters from a real-life game of Cluedo, and one of these sinister, shiny instruments could be the murder weapon. </p> <p>But, despite appearances, this is not the set for an Agatha Christie mystery. It's the London Fertility Centre in Harley Street, where life is created, not destroyed. This room, the professor explains, is where the eggs are removed. The fat woman will be coming in here soon. </p> <p>We scurry back into the waiting room, where the small cast of characters has now been joined by a doctor dressed entirely in surgeon's greens, whom the infertile woman is hugging. Our return is so the professor can flick through the pages of today's Daily Mail, which lies on the central carved table, searching for any mention of his name. </p> <p>The Mail has had a bit of a thing about the professor since 1997, when he treated Britain's oldest mother, Elizabeth Buttle, who gave birth at 60 after lying about her age. Last year his clinic knowingly treated 56-year-old Lynne Bezant with donor eggs, making her Britain's oldest mother of twins. The donor has now claimed in the Mail that she requested that her eggs went to a younger woman, and is threatening to sue. Behind almost every controversial case concerning reproductive technology emerges the name of Professor Craft. </p> <p>Unlike his rivals in the profession, he remains remarkably hands-on. He boasts that he performed 168 embryo transfers last year. In the hush of his clinic, under his bird-like blue eyes, the untreatable are treated. The lepers of the infertility world come to be warmed by the fire in his waiting room. For here, things happen that other clinics refuse to contemplate. </p> <p>This is the philosophy of reproduction according to Professor Craft. On surrogacy: \"When you are born without a uterus and you sometimes haven't got a vagina, or you've only got the bottom one third of it ... they're not freaks. Just the pack of cards they had was slightly different from normal. They could reproduce very successfully from surrogacy.\" On implanting multiple embryos: \"If a woman had got six embryos, and she's 41, I'd be prepared to put them in. The chance of her having triplets is not zero, but almost zero. But she's more likely to have the only child she can ever have.\" On sex selection: \"I cannot see that it would terribly unbalance society. If one day a high-street pharmacist found a kit which effectively allowed only the male semen to be used, is this government going to ban it?\" </p> <p>We have walked across the road, to his mews, as the professor cannot sit still; his body and brain flutter around his small home. \"I think I'm a sympathetic person to women. I think they have much more of a cross to bear in life than men, right? If men had to menstruate, civilisation would have stopped, it would have stopped. ... I tend to get passionate inside. Whether it's about music, opera, birdwatching, you know. That's me. I'm passionate about things. I stand up for principles ... Now going back to your question about number of embryos ...\" \"Well ...\" I say, and again get no further. </p> <p>Sixty-three-year-old Ian Logan Craft is ripe for amateur psychoanalysis, and everyone has their pet theory as to why Crafty, as those in the profession call him, is as he is. One insider puts it down to his failing the 11-plus; since then, he has been determined to prove himself. Another said he is driven by a need to impress his father, a Barclays bank official and devout Methodist who died two years ago. So here's my lowly attempt at dissecting the professor's thought processes: he's lonely. </p> <p>The professor lives by himself in uncontrolled clutter, having separated from his wife Jackie six years ago. But, as all lonely people, he is determined to prove he isn't lonely at all. In fact, I will be amazed at how full of friendship and activity his life is. He shows me photos of his two grandchildren, propped up next to those of the first triplets born through IVF 17 years ago - a Craft production. Among the chaos of his home, every invitation he has ever received is on display. He takes down a card from a friend and reads it to me, to demonstrate how loved he is. It is three years old. </p> <p>He's a joiner. He belongs to The Zoological Society, the RNLI, English Heritage and the Walpole Society, and is a Patron of British Art at Tate Britain. But when I ask him what it means to be a patron, he's not sure. \"I like artistic things. I'm a life member of Durham Cathedral. I'm trying at the moment to help the Deaf Blind Association.

      "bodyText": "\"Have You Asked About Laser Assisted Hatching?\" The notice hangs over the leather sofa, between the marble busts and overlarge arrangement of dried flowers. Tasselled curtains frame a mighty stone fireplace in which flickers a fake fire. All is the quiet of soft furnishings. Then into this calm scuttles our protagonist, a small silver-haired gentleman, with baby-pink puffy skin that seems as if it has never seen the sun. He is dressed in what could be his old school uniform - a red striped tie, maroon sweater and permacrease trousers - and waves a blue spotted handkerchief. \"Can I be of assistance to you?\" he begs, his leather-gloved hands hovering eagerly over my hugely pregnant belly. Then, sensing my alarm and presuming it's to do with the gloves, he adds, \"I have some rubber ones as well.\" The great advantage, he explains, is that he - Professor Ian Craft - is one of the few obstetricians who do their own epidurals: \"I could do yours.\" I hope he's joking. I am here, after all, as a journalist, even if a heavily pregnant one. \"Natural conception?\" he asks. \"Well ...\" I stutter. The small crowd in the waiting room are stony-faced. There's the infertile patient with her sister, whose hand she is holding tightly, as if to prevent her tumbling from the soft leather sofa. There's the egg donor with her mother, both extremely overweight. And there's the professor, who hurries me through to a larger room next door, with rather nice flock wallpaper, where a bench is lined with a row of fearsome-looking instruments, all metal, all sharp. If it wasn't for the Assisted Hatching notice, we could be characters from a real-life game of Cluedo, and one of these sinister, shiny instruments could be the murder weapon. But, despite appearances, this is not the set for an Agatha Christie mystery. It's the London Fertility Centre in Harley Street, where life is created, not destroyed. This room, the professor explains, is where the eggs are removed. The fat woman will be coming in here soon. We scurry back into the waiting room, where the small cast of characters has now been joined by a doctor dressed entirely in surgeon's greens, whom the infertile woman is hugging. Our return is so the professor can flick through the pages of today's Daily Mail, which lies on the central carved table, searching for any mention of his name. The Mail has had a bit of a thing about the professor since 1997, when he treated Britain's oldest mother, Elizabeth Buttle, who gave birth at 60 after lying about her age. Last year his clinic knowingly treated 56-year-old Lynne Bezant with donor eggs, making her Britain's oldest mother of twins. The donor has now claimed in the Mail that she requested that her eggs went to a younger woman, and is threatening to sue. Behind almost every controversial case concerning reproductive technology emerges the name of Professor Craft. Unlike his rivals in the profession, he remains remarkably hands-on. He boasts that he performed 168 embryo transfers last year. In the hush of his clinic, under his bird-like blue eyes, the untreatable are treated. The lepers of the infertility world come to be warmed by the fire in his waiting room. For here, things happen that other clinics refuse to contemplate. This is the philosophy of reproduction according to Professor Craft. On surrogacy: \"When you are born without a uterus and you sometimes haven't got a vagina, or you've only got the bottom one third of it ... they're not freaks. Just the pack of cards they had was slightly different from normal. They could reproduce very successfully from surrogacy.\" On implanting multiple embryos: \"If a woman had got six embryos, and she's 41, I'd be prepared to put them in. The chance of her having triplets is not zero, but almost zero. But she's more likely to have the only child she can ever have.\" On sex selection: \"I cannot see that it would terribly unbalance society. If one day a high-street pharmacist found a kit which effectively allowed only the male semen to be used, is this government going to ban it?\" We have walked across the road, to his mews, as the professor cannot sit still; his body and brain flutter around his small home. \"I think I'm a sympathetic person to women. I think they have much more of a cross to bear in life than men, right? If men had to menstruate, civilisation would have stopped, it would have stopped. ... I tend to get passionate inside. Whether it's about music, opera, birdwatching, you know. That's me. I'm passionate about things. I stand up for principles ... Now going back to your question about number of embryos ...\" \"Well ...\" I say, and again get no further. Sixty-three-year-old Ian Logan Craft is ripe for amateur psychoanalysis, and everyone has their pet theory as to why Crafty, as those in the profession call him, is as he is. One insider puts it down to his failing the 11-plus; since then, he has been determined to prove himself. Another said he is driven by a need to impress his father, a Barclays bank official and devout Methodist who died two years ago. So here's my lowly attempt at dissecting the professor's thought processes: he's lonely. The professor lives by himself in uncontrolled clutter, having separated from his wife Jackie six years ago. But, as all lonely people, he is determined to prove he isn't lonely at all. In fact, I will be amazed at how full of friendship and activity his life is. He shows me photos of his two grandchildren, propped up next to those of the first triplets born through IVF 17 years ago - a Craft production. Among the chaos of his home, every invitation he has ever received is on display. He takes down a card from a friend and reads it to me, to demonstrate how loved he is. It is three years old. He's a joiner. He belongs to The Zoological Society, the RNLI, English Heritage and the Walpole Society, and is a Patron of British Art at Tate Britain. But when I ask him what it means to be a patron, he's not sure. \"I like artistic things. I'm a life member of Durham Cathedral. I'm trying at the moment to help the Deaf Blind Association. I go to Glyndebourne because I love music. I went to the proms 43 times last year. I've seen the Tempest twice. I'm going out tonight. There's a symphony written for me. In fact, there's a picture of a human embryo on the front of the CD.\" I note that the piles of junk mail are all opened. A less lonely person would put them straight in the bin. This paper clutter makes him feel as if he's in demand. I have other evidence to support my theory. He wanted me to like him. In fact, he desperately wanted me to like him. He was determined to put his best side forward. \"I just want to make people happy. I've always loved that old Scottish song, 'If I can help someone as I'm passing along, my life will not be in vain.' \" But my analysis is confounded by the simple fact that he does so much to affront others. He doesn't set out to win friends and influence people; he knowingly sets out to offend. Despite his high success rate, he has no supporters in the small world of reproductive technology. Most regard him as a hurdle towards wider acceptance of new techniques. He goes too far, they say, leading to legislation being enacted to prevent his kind of extreme practices. If he didn't do what he did, then there would not be the caution towards assisted conception that exists today. But there is another way of looking at it. Once the tabloids have splashed on a 56-year-old having twins, they cannot retell the tale. If, next month, a 52-year-old has twins, it's no longer news. The reproductive goalposts have shifted. Professor Craft sets the pace and others trot along behind. Without his risk-taking, we would still all be suspicious of even simple IVF on a 30-year-old. During the debate over the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, a move to limit treatment to married couples was defeated by a single vote. Already the professor is late for his next patient, for whom he is probably their best and last chance. But he doesn't want to leave me. I try to extricate myself by going to the toilet, but he follows me in. \"I'm just very innovative. You pay a price for being a pioneer,\" he says as I wash my hands.

      "bodyText": "David Clarke, managing director of Trinity Mirror Digital, has quit following last Thursday's strategic retrenchment. Mr Clarke, the former boss of Virgin Net, is not thought to have another job to go to. Graham Mead, managing director of the IC Network, will now take the reins of Trinity Mirror's embattled new media division. Mr Mead took on his current role in October after six months as managing director of the regional websites. Before that he had spent a number of years working directly for Trinity boss Philip Graf in various marketing roles. Mr Mead said his erstwhile colleague's decision to leave was \"very straight forward\". \"It was a shared view that it was no longer appropriate for him to manage the business now the strategic direction is very different from how it was when he joined,\" Mr Mead explained. Mr Clarke came on board in April 1999 to launch the internet service provider IC24 and expand the new media department. After the merger with Trinity, the division evolved into Trinity Mirror Digital and employed 300 people. It is now being cut back dramatically - up to a third of staff are facing redundancy as Trinity Mirror looks to sell the ISP and close its websites. After breaking the news to its employees, Trinity Mirror Digital sent two-thirds of them home and said it would be in touch before April 15 with a decision on their fate.

The France Telecom-owned company today said it was making \"strong progress\" towards launching the high-tech 3G network after paying billions of pounds for transmission licences across Europe. But it gave no deadline for a launch, and instead promised that GPRS, or general packet radio service, will be introduced in the UK and France. GPRS offers \"always on\" internet access and faster transfer of data such as emails, but not the video images, games and entertainment which 3G promises. The announcement came as Orange unveiled its annual results, which showed a net loss of \u00a3815m, virtually unchanged from last year. However, the boom in text messaging helped revenues climb 59% to \u00a37.5bn and the customer base increased 68% to 30m people, with the UK supplying 9.8m of that total. The results were in line with analysts' expectations, but the level of debt at telecoms operators continues to concern investors.

Early footage of the unpolished yet fiercely ambitious girls drew 9.4m viewers - almost 40% of the available audience - at 8pm, according to unofficial overnights. The documentary, produced by Neil Davies and Matthew Bowers, was shown last night after four years of legal wrangling. The film was the subject of disputes with former members of the film's production company and with Victoria Beckham, who tried to prevent it from being screened. Many Raw Spice viewers stayed tuned to ITV, giving the Hunt a 34% of audience share at 9pm. The two-part drama about love in rural England starring Amanda Holden pulled in 7.6m viewers. And Ms Holden beat off competition from John Cleese in the Human Face. The second part of the BBC1 documentary series brought in only 4.8m viewers and a 21% audience share. The evening's other top performer was new Channel 4 drama Teachers. The first episode, starring former This Life actor Andrew Lincoln, was watched by 2.5m viewers - a 14% audience share - at 10pm.

The attack came 10 hours after a deadline for the rebels to either leave Macedonian territory or to surrender had expired.</p> <p>In Tetovo police shot two men dead in the street. State radio said they had tried to ambush the police position with grenades.</p> <p>There was further violence elsewhere. Police reported that one officer was wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade just outside Skopje - the second incident targeting a policeman in or near the capital in the last 24 hours.</p> <p>Elsewhere near the capital eight police officers were pinned down in an ambush, said officials.</p> <p>The Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, said yesterday that it was necessary for the country to take control of its border.</p> <p>Negotiations for a peaceful settlement were still possible, he said, but only through parliament and other established institutions, not through direct negotiations with the rebels.</p> <p>Police had claimed that a \"sweep and search\" movement through the rebel-occupied area preceded the attack. An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that those insurgents who were not arrested fled without a fight to the Kosovo border.</p> <p>The rebels offered no comment on the police claims and agency reports said that the scene behind insurgent lines remained the same as before the offensive began. Fortifications and roadblocks were in place and there was no sign of mass retreat.</p> <p>Rebel sniper positions two-and-a-half miles from Tetovo's centre were manned, casting further doubt on the police claims.</p> <p>The EU expressed support for the government's position.</p> <p>\"The message from the West is very clear - the extremist groups must lay down their weapons,\" said the Swedish foreign minister, Anna Lindh, who is in Skopje on behalf of the EU.</p> <p>The rebels say that they are a home grown movement fighting for greater rights in Macedonia, where ethnic Albanians are outnumbered by Slavs by three to one.</p> <p>However, the government claims that the rebels are linked to fighters across the border in Kosovo and aim to break off northern Macedonia to form an independent ethnic Albanian state.</p> <p>Although ethnic relations with the majority Slavs have been relatively free of trouble, substantial numbers of the ethnic Albanian minority feel they are being treated as second-class citizens. The struggle appears to have radicalised a large segment of ethnic Albanians.</p> <p>In a last-minute concession, the rebels yesterday declared a ceasefire and called anew for talks to end the conflict peacefully.</p> <p>\"We, the general staff of the National Liberation Army (NLA), announce a unilateral cease fire and we open the road for dialogue so heads can cool down and to find the best solution,\" said Ali Ahmeti, the political head of the NLA, in a taped television broadcast in neighbouring Kosovo.</p> <p>He said the ceasefire was open ended, but warned that the struggle would continue in the event of an attack.</p> <p>The government ignored the offer.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,450658,00.html\">The fighting in Macedonia explained</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,459237,00.html\">Map: where is Tetovo?</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"  http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee8064c/0\">Should Nato intervene?</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0320carroll.ra  \">Rory Carroll on the mountain massacre threat (2mins 45)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/article/0,5814,387922,00.html\">How do I listen to audio reports?</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/audio/\">More audio reports</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,460071,00.html\">The conflict in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Kosovo/\">Kosovo</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/serbia/0,2759,221850,00.html\">Serbia</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yugo\">Yugoslavia war crimes</a><br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461030,00.html  \">22.3.2001: Macedonia rejects ceasefire offer</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461031,00.html  \">22.3.2001: Britain and US help drive against Albanians</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461050,00.html  \">22.3.2001: Fear and suspicion seep into the capital</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,461270,00.html\">22.3.2001, Balkans dispatch: why Nato is ignoring Macedonia</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,460143,00.html  \">20.3.2001, comment: Macedonian crisis does not mean war in Balkans</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,459864,00.html  \">20.3.2001, leader: Macedonia on its own</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.gov.mk/english\" target=\"_NEW\">Macedonian government</a> <br><a href=\"  http://www.morm.gov.mk/granica/nastanie.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Macedonian defence ministry - updates on border clashes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.al\" target=\"_NEW\">Albanian foreign ministry</a> <br><a href=\"  http://www.albanian.com/main/countries/macedonia/\" target=\"_new\">Albania.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.al\">Albanian foreign ministry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gov.yu/1024/index.html\">Yugoslav government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4821\" target=\"_NEW\">Foreign secretary Robin Cook's statement on Macedonia</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.kforonline.com/news/updates.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">K-For news updates</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Macedonian troops have launched a new offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in the hills above the country's second city. Artillery fire and mortars were heard shortly after 9am in Tetovo, shattering more than 24 hours of calm. The attack came 10 hours after a deadline for the rebels to either leave Macedonian territory or to surrender had expired. In Tetovo police shot two men dead in the street. State radio said they had tried to ambush the police position with grenades. There was further violence elsewhere. Police reported that one officer was wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade just outside Skopje - the second incident targeting a policeman in or near the capital in the last 24 hours. Elsewhere near the capital eight police officers were pinned down in an ambush, said officials. The Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, said yesterday that it was necessary for the country to take control of its border. Negotiations for a peaceful settlement were still possible, he said, but only through parliament and other established institutions, not through direct negotiations with the rebels. Police had claimed that a \"sweep and search\" movement through the rebel-occupied area preceded the attack. An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that those insurgents who were not arrested fled without a fight to the Kosovo border. The rebels offered no comment on the police claims and agency reports said that the scene behind insurgent lines remained the same as before the offensive began. Fortifications and roadblocks were in place and there was no sign of mass retreat. Rebel sniper positions two-and-a-half miles from Tetovo's centre were manned, casting further doubt on the police claims. The EU expressed support for the government's position. \"The message from the West is very clear - the extremist groups must lay down their weapons,\" said the Swedish foreign minister, Anna Lindh, who is in Skopje on behalf of the EU. The rebels say that they are a home grown movement fighting for greater rights in Macedonia, where ethnic Albanians are outnumbered by Slavs by three to one. However, the government claims that the rebels are linked to fighters across the border in Kosovo and aim to break off northern Macedonia to form an independent ethnic Albanian state. Although ethnic relations with the majority Slavs have been relatively free of trouble, substantial numbers of the ethnic Albanian minority feel they are being treated as second-class citizens. The struggle appears to have radicalised a large segment of ethnic Albanians. In a last-minute concession, the rebels yesterday declared a ceasefire and called anew for talks to end the conflict peacefully. \"We, the general staff of the National Liberation Army (NLA), announce a unilateral cease fire and we open the road for dialogue so heads can cool down and to find the best solution,\" said Ali Ahmeti, the political head of the NLA, in a taped television broadcast in neighbouring Kosovo. He said the ceasefire was open ended, but warned that the struggle would continue in the event of an attack. The government ignored the offer. What's going on?

It will, for example, allow us to maintain existing cancer registries, one of our best weapons in the fight against cancer. It will prevent the commercial abuse of patients data, protect the NHS and allow patients to be kept better informed about their own treatment. The clause has three purposes. It will allow essential work such as medical research or the monitoring of diseases to continue. The bill will ensure doctors can share patient information if doing so will benefit patients and the public and, critically, only when there is no reasonable, practicable alternative. Our prime objective is to safeguard existing programmes such as cancer registries, which help develop more effective treatments for cancer. Cancer registries provide information on the incidence of cancer in the population and on death rates and survival rates. This information is vital for planning cancer services and for monitoring their effectiveness. Cancer registries are also essential for research into the causes of cancer. The NHS depends upon information for understanding and improving the health of the public, increasing life expectancy and raising quality of life. Without information, important research work grinds to a halt. Information about patients is therefore a precious and irreplaceable resource. Patients trust doctors and nurses. They share their most intimate secrets with them in confidence. The NHS has enjoyed the privilege of using this information for decades, and has accomplished much good, but it has done so in the absence of the informed consent of patients. This cannot continue. Over the years, the NHS has, with the best of intentions, slipped into a tradition of paternalism, where the benefits of science and research have been seen as somehow self-evident, regardless of the wishes of patients. The government has made it clear that from now on the fundamental principle governing the use of patient information by any part of the NHS or research community must be informed consent. But the NHS cannot deliver informed consent overnight, it will take several years. This is the why clause 67 contains a power to support key activities where it is presently not practicable to gain consent. First, it allows essential work to continue while the NHS develops systems based on informed consent or that cannot reveal the identity of the patient. Use of this power will be governed by robust safeguards. Some of these are set out in the clause and others are being developed by a working group that includes representatives from the Patients Association, the General Medical Council and the British Medical Association. Decisions to use this power will be made as part of an open and consultative process and the agreement of both houses of parliament after full debate. There is no question of information being used for anything other than combating disease and safeguarding public health. Second, clause 67 aims to prevent commercial interests profiting inappropriately from NHS and patient information. It enables the government to regulate the use of this sort of information for \"marketing or other promotional activity\" only. Again, use of the power will need the approval of both houses of parliament after full debate. Finally, the clause provides a basis in law for patients to receive more information about their care and treatment. Patients should be kept informed at every stage of their treatment. These powers will allow doctors and consultants to copy patients into the correspondence sent between them ensuring patients are kept informed at every step of their treatment.",

A report into alleged links between the Europe minister and the billionaire Hinduja brothers was indeed published a fortnight ago.

This story led Tory MP Andrew Lansley to make a complaint to Elizabeth Filkin, the Commons standards commissioner, who has now reopened her investigation.

What form will the inquiries take? Ms Filkin looks into allegations against sitting MPs but has no powers to force MPs to respond to her inquiries, other than naming and shaming them if they fail to do so.

Mr Dumas, 78, is accused of forcing Elf to employ his ex-lover, the former lingerie model Christine Deviers-Joncour, 53, in a high-paid job with next to no duties. The couple are alleged to have wallowed in Elf's largesse, buying a multimillion-pound Left Bank flat and lavish gifts for each other with company funds. The trial was the culmination of a seven-year judicial investigation, led by the crusading judge Eva Joly, into Elf's affairs between 1989 and 1993. Mr Dumas denies illegally receiving Fr64.5m (\u00a36.2m) in commissions paid by Elf in the early 1990s and profiting from the money the company gave his lover to lobby him in connection with the controversial sale of six frigates to Taiwan by another state-controlled firm, Thompson, in 1991. Mr Dumas' lawyer said yesterday that French politics did not work in the way that the prosecution had suggested. \"Do you have such a contempt for politics that you think everything is a fix-up, that any minister can call up to have a friend appointed to this or that senior position?\" Jean-Rene Farthouat shouted at the prosecution. \" There are procedures! There is a system!\" But Ms Deviers-Joncour has admitted taking money from Elf in return for trying to influence Mr Dumas's decisions. The state prosecutor, Jean-Pierre Champrenault, asked for a two-year prison sentence and a Fr2.5m (\u00a3240,000) fine for Mr Dumas and a three year term - with one year suspended - and a Fr1M fine for Ms Deviers-Joncour. He urged the judge to impose the maximum sen tence of five years in jail on Elf's former chief executive Loik Le Floch-Prigent, and his number two, Alfred Sirven, allegedly the mastermind of a Fr400m Elf slush fund. He described the affair as being inspired by \"mafia-type logic\", arguing that by offering him signs of their generosity to his mistress Elf bosses wanted to put Mr Dumas in their debt. For two months the case has been an unmissable soap opera in France, with its tales of high-living, sexual betrayal, slush funds, dubious arms sales, and a host of larger-than-life characters. Leading them has been Mr Dumas, an ageing roue who turned up to court each day in an elegant suit, leaning on a cane.

The magazine launched on March 8 with a print run of 647,000 and backed by a \u00a35m marketing campaign. Early figures suggest the circulation of the first issue will be over 400,000, twice Conde Nast's original target of 200,000. \"Newsagents told us last week they had sold out in a lot of their branches and we thought we can't have that,\" said Simon Kippin, publisher of Glamour. \"WH Smith are saying they have never seen anything like it.

The timing of the launch made it particularly difficult, coming just two weeks after Time Inc's In Style magazine made its UK debut. The magazine's A5 format also raised eyebrows when it was first revealed. Conde Nast managing director Nicholas Coleridge has described the launch of Glamour as \"the most ambitious and controversial magazine project of my 12 years at Conde Nast\". Glamour's website is also being hailed as a success. Within two days of launch glamourmagazine.co.uk had registered almost 80,000 page impressions.

      "body": "<p>Blowing the whistle on a colleague or raising awareness of bad practice takes courage, even in the new culture of openness that employees are told now exists.</p> <p>For the individual who decides to challenge the status quo, the implications of the decision to highlight wrongdoing may mean, at best, a period of stressful suspension, and, at worst, blighted career prospects.</p> <p>Last year, Sian Caiach, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, raised concerns that a fellow doctor at the Prince Philip hospital in Llanelli was using NHS time and resources to treat private patients. An audit commission investigation substantiated some of her claims and found that the hospital was subsidising private patients and had lost income of \u00a37,500.</p> <p>Since that time, Ms Caiach has not worked and has been on what is described as extended maternity leave for almost eight months. She is also the subject of an investigation by the Royal College of Surgeons after allegations were made about her clinical practice.</p> <p>\"It has been an intensely unpleasant, stressful and distressing experience. With the knowledge that I now have of what can happen to someone who raises awareness in these circumstances, it would be an extremely close call as to whether I would be prepared to do the same again. It is not just your own personal victimisation but the effects on those around you. It is hard to hide the psychological distress,\" she says.</p> <p>Bunny Pinnington, a school nurse, also knows the cost of blowing the whistle. Over three years ago, while working in a Swansea school for children with profound disabilities, she was given a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) instruction for a child, by the head teacher. She alleges that this was done without consultation with the child's grandparents, who were the child's carers, and against the medical opinion of the child's consultant.</p> <p>\"I can't put into words what I have gone through after I raised this issue. I was still working and so was the head teacher. It was intolerable and the subtle isolation and stress was immense. Everybody seems to close ranks and those with power seem to win in these cases. You find that there is very little support; you are on your own. After taking sick leave and then returning, I raised the same issue again and was suspended,\" she says.</p> <p>In November last year, the Welsh assembly announced that there would an in-depth inquiry into the issues surrounding the care plans of children with special needs in Wales. Although ministers at the assembly did not feel that the events at the Swansea school warranted a public inquiry, there was a commitment to \"urgently take forward this inquiry\" because of the importance of the general issues that had been raised. Ms Pinnington's case is the subject of a preliminary appeal before the employment appeals tribunal in April.</p> <p>Geoffrey Hunt, who has carried out extensive research on whistle blowing, both in social services and the health service, says there remains considerable secrecy in public and private organisations.</p> <p>\"Managers are still not listening, or [they are] victimising, those who raise concerns. At the moment, Freedom to Care, the organisation founded to give support to whistleblowers, is looking at the case of a senior nurse working in residential care. She was an experienced and well thought of practitioner, but when she raised questions about low standards, she was demoted and has now resigned in protest,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Residential care is an area where we see a lot of wrongdoing and a lot of victimisation. I would say that, in many ways, despite public disclosure legislation, the situation is no better. There has been a limited cultural acceptance that those people play an important role in highlighting serious concerns, but there is still a pervasive climate of fear.\"</p> <p>In July 1999, the Public Interest Disclosure Act came into force after concern over a number of high profile cases, such as the north Wales child abuse scandal and the inquiry into the baby deaths at Bristol Royal Infirmary.</p> <p>Caroline Miller of Public Concern at Work, the charity that campaigned for the legislation, says it is designed to protect people who raise concerns that are in the public interest.</p> <p>\"It covers a wide range and could be used for instance where there are issues surrounding abuse within an institution, or fraud. There have been several notable successes under the act.

      "bodyText": "Blowing the whistle on a colleague or raising awareness of bad practice takes courage, even in the new culture of openness that employees are told now exists. For the individual who decides to challenge the status quo, the implications of the decision to highlight wrongdoing may mean, at best, a period of stressful suspension, and, at worst, blighted career prospects. Last year, Sian Caiach, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, raised concerns that a fellow doctor at the Prince Philip hospital in Llanelli was using NHS time and resources to treat private patients. An audit commission investigation substantiated some of her claims and found that the hospital was subsidising private patients and had lost income of \u00a37,500. Since that time, Ms Caiach has not worked and has been on what is described as extended maternity leave for almost eight months. She is also the subject of an investigation by the Royal College of Surgeons after allegations were made about her clinical practice. \"It has been an intensely unpleasant, stressful and distressing experience. With the knowledge that I now have of what can happen to someone who raises awareness in these circumstances, it would be an extremely close call as to whether I would be prepared to do the same again. It is not just your own personal victimisation but the effects on those around you. It is hard to hide the psychological distress,\" she says. Bunny Pinnington, a school nurse, also knows the cost of blowing the whistle. Over three years ago, while working in a Swansea school for children with profound disabilities, she was given a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) instruction for a child, by the head teacher. She alleges that this was done without consultation with the child's grandparents, who were the child's carers, and against the medical opinion of the child's consultant. \"I can't put into words what I have gone through after I raised this issue. I was still working and so was the head teacher. It was intolerable and the subtle isolation and stress was immense. Everybody seems to close ranks and those with power seem to win in these cases. You find that there is very little support; you are on your own. After taking sick leave and then returning, I raised the same issue again and was suspended,\" she says. In November last year, the Welsh assembly announced that there would an in-depth inquiry into the issues surrounding the care plans of children with special needs in Wales. Although ministers at the assembly did not feel that the events at the Swansea school warranted a public inquiry, there was a commitment to \"urgently take forward this inquiry\" because of the importance of the general issues that had been raised. Ms Pinnington's case is the subject of a preliminary appeal before the employment appeals tribunal in April. Geoffrey Hunt, who has carried out extensive research on whistle blowing, both in social services and the health service, says there remains considerable secrecy in public and private organisations. \"Managers are still not listening, or [they are] victimising, those who raise concerns. At the moment, Freedom to Care, the organisation founded to give support to whistleblowers, is looking at the case of a senior nurse working in residential care. She was an experienced and well thought of practitioner, but when she raised questions about low standards, she was demoted and has now resigned in protest,\" he says. \"Residential care is an area where we see a lot of wrongdoing and a lot of victimisation. I would say that, in many ways, despite public disclosure legislation, the situation is no better. There has been a limited cultural acceptance that those people play an important role in highlighting serious concerns, but there is still a pervasive climate of fear.\" In July 1999, the Public Interest Disclosure Act came into force after concern over a number of high profile cases, such as the north Wales child abuse scandal and the inquiry into the baby deaths at Bristol Royal Infirmary. Caroline Miller of Public Concern at Work, the charity that campaigned for the legislation, says it is designed to protect people who raise concerns that are in the public interest. \"It covers a wide range and could be used for instance where there are issues surrounding abuse within an institution, or fraud. There have been several notable successes under the act. The reason for our existence is to change the culture so that it is safe to raise concerns,\" she says. She adds. \"The act is a lever but the culture is changing very slowly. Interestingly, the cases that have gone forward under the act tend to be in the private sector, but the majority of calls we receive on our helpline are from the public sector.\" One of the problems, according to the organisation, is that there has been almost no publicity about the legislation. \"It was a private members bill and it has been very much left to us as a small charity to try to publicise how the legislation can help,\" says director Guy Dehn. \"At the moment the government is spending \u00a35m telling people that they have the right to a paid annual holiday. We would say that most employees are probably aware of this but that they are very unlikely to understand their rights under the public disclosure legislation.\" And, he points out, the legislation cannot stop unscrupulous employers harassing employees who speak out if no one knows about it or uses it. \"The importance of whistleblowing is that it is a way of emphasising the importance of bearing witness to something that needs to be brought out into the public domain. If the legislation were properly publicised, it would result in employers realising that it is not in their interest to try to cover things up.\" \u0095 Public Concern at Work can be contacted on 020 404 6609.",

Say, how about a lit- \" A sharp slap, \"Ouch!\" Then Maisie, in Brooklynese tones, would reply, \"Does that answer your question, buddy?\"</p> <p>Ann Sothern, who was born Harriette Lake in North Dakota, was trained as a classical singer by her concert-soprano mother. But she found her temperament and voice were more suited for musical comedy. On Broadway, she soon rose from small parts to leads in Ziegfeld shows under her real name.</p> <p>In 1933 she went to Hollywood, where she spent six years at various studios playing light-hearted heroines in mostly B pictures. However, she did have a chance to shine opposite Eddie Cantor in Kid Millions, and as Mimi, Maurice Chevalier's showgirl mistress, in Folies Berg\u00e8re. In Trade Winds (1938), for United Artists, Sothern, as detective Fredric March's dumb blonde sidekick, stole the picture from the leading lady, Joan Bennett.</p> <p>Her performance gained the attention of MGM, who considered Sothern perfect to play the title role in Maisie. The studio had bought the 1935 Wilson Collison novel Dark Dame as a vehicle for Jean Harlow. After Harlow's premature death in 1937, it was shelved.

However, her charm, pleasant singing voice and good looks were well used in musicals such as Lady Be Good (1941) and Panama Hattie (1942). She displayed dramatic talent in the all-female Cry Havoc (1943), as a warm-hearted army nurse in Bataan.</p> <p>Perhaps her best film was Joseph L Mankiewicz's A Letter To Three Wives (1948), for 20th Century-Fox. In this stringent and witty social comedy, Sothern plays a radio soap writer, married to intellectual schoolteacher Kirk Douglas, who despises his wife's work. She is particularly effective in the dinner party scene, when she has to try to please both her husband and her sponsors.</p> <p>After playing Jane Powell's actress mother in Nancy Goes To Rio (1950) and Anne Baxter's wise-cracking roommate in Fritz Lang's The Blue Gardenia (1953), she retired from films, retaining her popularity on TV in 104 episodes of Private Secretary, which she produced herself. She later sold the rights for more than $1m. Sothern also held the rights of the equally popular The Ann Sothern Show, in which she played the assistant manager of a swanky New York hotel. \"I think Hollywood has been terrible to me,\" she once commented. \"Hollywood doesn't respond to a strong woman, not at all.

During a particularly bad time in her life, she befriended the film actor Richard Egan, under whose influence she converted to Catholicism. Previously, she had been married to two minor screen actors, both of whom she had appeared with in films: Roger Pryor and Robert Sterling (aka socialite William J Hart). Her daughter by the latter, Tisha Sterling, became an actress. (She had a leading role in Coogan's Bluff with Clint Eastwood.)</p> <p>In the 1960s, having put on a great deal of weight in the interim, Sothern returned to the big screen playing blowsy hookers in three films: Lady In A Cage (1963), tormenting rich widow Olivia de Havilland; in Sylvia (1965), with Carroll Baker; and Chubasco (1967), in which she ran a brothel visited by real-life lover Richard Egan. In The Best Man (1964), she was a sententious and dangerous political committee woman. \"It did Adlai Stevenson great harm not having a wife and trying to be funny all at the same time,\" she warns an unmarried presidential candidate - which could well have been a reference to Gore Vidal, who adapted his play for the screen.</p> <p>Apart from some schlocky movies in the 70s and 80s, she was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role as the friend and confidante of elderly sisters Lillian Gish and Bette Davis in Lindsay Anderson's The Whales Of August (1987). A few years ago, Ann Sothern remarked: \"Sometimes I'll watch an old movie on TV and once in a while one of mine will come on and I'll watch it. And you know something?

Maybe it's the combination of windswept edge-of-the-world bleakness and the forlorn remnants of out-of-season frivolity, but the Kent seaside town's amusement arcade, Dreamland, appears to exert an uncanny fascination over film-makers with an eye for irony. The arcade - with its mocking \"Welcome to Dreamland\" sign - is the central image of Last Resort, the new asylum-seeker romance from Pawel Pawlikowski.</p> <p>But 45 years earlier, the same arcade formed the subject matter for Lindsay Anderson's landmark 12-minute film O Dreamland. Shot in 1953, O Dreamland was the spearhead of Free Cinema, Britain's contribution to the flood of new waves that swept the global film industry in the years after the war. Pawlikowski films the modern Dreamland and its serried ranks of slot machines with a metaphoric cast; Anderson's Dreamland belongs to a different era, a compendium of model torture shows and fairground attractions, paced by patient lines of daytrippers. </p> <p>O Dreamland didn't make a public impact until three years later - in 1956, in fact, as part of the inaugural Free Cinema programme at London's National Film Theatre in February of that year. Screening with it were two other low-budget British short films: Together - a 50-minute fiction by Lorenza Mazzetti and Denis Horne, about deaf-mute brothers living in London's East End - and Momma Don't Allow, a mostly documentary account of teens dancing to Chris Barber at the Fishmonger's Arms in Wood Green, co-directed by Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson. Tonight, the NFT plans to recreate the event by screening the three films once again. </p> <p>Free Cinema was a commendably high-minded phenomenon, taking its cue largely from the inspirational Anderson, a prolific journalist whose work appeared regularly in Sight and Sound magazine as well as Sequence, the journal he helped found in 1947. Three decades later, in 1977, Anderson explained the opportunistic origins of the Free Cinema movement. </p> <p>In 1955, he was unable to get his own films distributed, yet claimed some influence in the Oxbridge-educated coterie that dominated the BFI's experimental production programme. So he helped Italian art student Mazzetti to finish her deaf-mute film after co-writer Horne quit the project. With like-minded friends he pushed for a screening for Together at the NFT, along with his own already-completed documentary. Later Free Cinema programmes in 1957 and 1958 brought choice short films from Europe, including Roman Polanski's Two Men and a Wardrobe, and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Les Mistons. </p> <p>Though its reputation has waned since, under the dismissive attacks of successive generations of critics anxious to puncture Anderson's self-assurance, Free Cinema has genuine claim to being a valuable, if undernourished, phenomenon. The same names recur on the credits, including Anderson himself, cinematographer Walter Lassally, and the multi-faceted John Fletcher. Other friends followed up with press articles - notably Gavin Lambert's piece in the spring issue of Sight and Sound, a magazine of which he happened to be editor. </p> <p>Lambert demonstrated the se riousness of the Free Cinema mission - quoting DH Lawrence and Dylan Thomas, citing Zavattini, the great scenarist of Italian neo-realism, and acknowledging John Grierson and Humphrey Jennings, Free Cinema's documentarist forebears. In his article, Lambert also provided the most succinct and articulate expression of Free Cinema principles. \"In the broadest sense,\" Lambert asserts, \"[they] are films of protest . . . The camera-eye they turn on society is disenchanted, sad, occasionally ferocious and bitter.\" </p> <p>Anderson's principal inspiration, however, was Jennings's lyrical formalism. In a 1954 essay, he praised Jennings - maker of home-front documentaries such as Fires Were Started and Listen to Britain - as \"the only real poet the British cinema has yet produced\". In Jennings's films, Anderson discovered a \"style based on a peculiar intimacy of observation\" and \"a pattern of relationships and contrasts, endlessly varying, but each one contributing to the rounded poetic statement of the whole.\" Anderson sought to emulate this combination of idiosyncratic observation and meaningful juxtaposition in O Dreamland. </p> <p>In fact, a pointed kind of documentary is the heart of all three original Free Cinema films. O Dreamland - somewhat infected with public-school distaste for Britain's brutish soul - follows the Jennings template of juxtaposition and statement. Momma Don't Allow, with its engaging jazz score, melds observation of teen rituals with a near-wordless narrative that gradually emerges from the surrounding v\u00e9rit\u00e9. </p> <p>Together is the most narratively ambitious: again, hardly a word is spoken as the two principal characters, both deaf-mutes, make their way among East End children cavorting untutored for the camera. They make an instructive comparison with Last Resort: Pawlikowski, a documentary-maker by trade, plants a sense of actuality in his film by harnessing a range of v\u00e9rit\u00e9 camera styles - juddering close-ups, video surveillance, hidden shooting positions - that achieves a similar, if considerably more fluid, effect. </p> <p>Free Cinema's outspoken self- regard aroused hostility. Seeking to cultivate a generation gap, Anderson warred in print with Grierson, the godfather of the 30s documentarists, who responded by calling Free Cinema \"baby stuff\" and writing a series of ripostes, again in Sight and Sound, through 1954 and 1955. More contemporary critics too - Gilbert Adair and David Thomson - have weighed in. And no one in the technical side of the industry shed a tear when Free Cinema declared itself finished in 1959, after a screening of Karel Reisz's We are the Lambeth Boys. </p> <p>So how should we judge Free Cinema now? Though its output was small, its claim as a pioneering example of New Wave is valid. The thirst for greater authenticity and a desire to break out of the studio, was the motor behind every New Wave film-maker. Even if it lacked the thematic sophistication of the French Nouvelle Vague, or the counter-culture robustness of the Hollywood auteurs, Free Cinema was a remarkable, ambitious phase in British film-making culture that should be treasured. </p> <p>Free Cinema's key failure was its inability to translate its precepts into feature films. No such loss of nerve afflicted the European contingent: history records a vast range of original films, from Truffaut's The 400 Blows to Polanski's Knife in the Water. Richardson, Reisz, and Anderson, meanwhile, filmed books and plays of stolid, less-than-inspiring toughness, and the chance was lost. But their Free Cinema films are archeological fragments of a notion that verged on genuine magnificence. </p> <p>\u0095 The Free Cinema Special Event is at the NFT, London SE1 tonight at 6.30pm.

      "body": "<p>It's been a big week for internet safety. On Tuesday, the Home Office's internet crime forum published Chat Wise, Street Wise, a report highlighting the dangers posed to young people using chat rooms. And industry insiders report that the government is set to announce a spring internet safety summit. </p> <p>But from today, chat rooms will be safer. At least, they will be if you follow an eight-point guideline issued by the Department for Education and Employment. </p> <p>The new guidelines, written for the DfEE by the internet safety agency, Childnet International, are aimed at parents and teachers, but also send a message to the industry. </p> <p>They recommend that children only use chat rooms that are moderated by a known moderator. They highlight the use of rooms that have topics advertised in advance, as the BBC does. And they warn against the use of rooms with advertising or other links that can draw children away from a group environment. </p> <p>Safety is at the top of the list with checks for safety issues and password verification so that adults cannot pose as children. </p> <p>One in five children who use computer chat rooms have been approached by paedophiles, according to the head of the internet crime forum. Detective chief superintendent Keith Akerman said: \"There is clearly a problem out there of which parents are not yet fully aware. The aim of this report is to highlight the dangers and suggest ways the risk can be reduced.\" </p> <p>But not all chat rooms are dangerous places, are they? Many are simply full of kids talking about their favourite bands and TV soap stars? </p> <p>\"If a parent went into a chat room, they might think it's harmless fun,\" says Stephen Carrick-Davies, of Childnet International, who wrote today's guide. \"It's a good way to relax and have fun. We don't say that chat rooms should be shut down. They are here to stay and they have good educational opportunities. </p> <p>\"But the key thing that parents need to be aware of is that children have to lie to get online. It only works by giving an alias.\" </p> <p>This means that people can pose as anyone else. I could call myself Bugs Bunny in a chat room. The potential for disaster is becoming clearer. </p> <p>According to an NOP poll last November, almost 5m seven-to-16-year-olds in the UK use the internet and a quarter of those use chat rooms. But 10% have heard things in these rooms that embarrassed or upset them. </p> <p>The main danger is that an adult may try to develop an inappropriate relationship offline with a child. </p> <p> Last October, Patrick Green, 33, a divorced exports clerk from Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire, was sentenced to a five-year jail term for abusing a 13-year-old girl. He had met her in a chat room called Younger Girls for Older Men and exchanged messages with her for two months before meeting her. </p> <p>He was arrested in Cumbria on his way to meet another 14-year-old girl he had met online and arranged to spend a weekend with. Judge Christopher Tyrer described him as a \"predator\" and ordered him to remain on the sex offenders' register for life. </p> <p>Childnet is now lobbying the government to make enticement on the internet a recognised crime. </p> <p>Last month, seven members of a global child pornography ring were jailed for distributing more than 750,000 images of child sex abuse. The club, which police believe had been operating for at least five years, required new members to provide 10,000 new images of child pornography as an entry fee. </p> <p>The Wonderland Club involved the rape of boys and girls live on camera and the torture of children as young as two months. The images were so appalling that the National Crime Squad officers who had to look through them had compulsory counselling. To date, only two of the 1,236 Wonderland victims have been traced. It is feared that one of the two has been murdered. </p> <p>Police and probation officers now fear that a wave of internet porn is sweeping the country, encouraged by light sentencing, some as lenient as 80 hours' community service. A financial adviser earning \u00a3100,000 a year recently received a three month prison sentence when police discovered that he often spent 18 hours a day downloading obscene images from the net. </p> <p>But, says Carrick-Davies, the guidelines are not a knee-jerk reaction. \"There are wonderful things that children can pick up in chat rooms. It introduces them to other cultures. However, we need to put the dangers in context. </p> <p>\"We are not saying the internet is evil and we must shut it down. We want to portray the brighter things but we want to say there is a dark side and these are the types of steps you can take to ensure that your children are really safe.\" </p> <p><strong> The guidelines </strong><br> </p> <p> 1. Is the chat room moderated? </p> <p>2. Who are the moderators? </p> <p>3. Has the chat room got a clear terms and conditions policy? </p> <p>4. Does the chat room have a clear topic/subject timetable? </p> <p>5. Does the chat room have advertising or external links? </p> <p>6. Does the chat room give young people genuine opportunities for students to interact and shape the chat? </p> <p>7. Does the chat room have appropriate access control and password verification? Can anyone join? </p> <p>8. Does the chat room remind users about safety issues?</p>",

The aim of this report is to highlight the dangers and suggest ways the risk can be reduced.\" But not all chat rooms are dangerous places, are they? Many are simply full of kids talking about their favourite bands and TV soap stars? \"If a parent went into a chat room, they might think it's harmless fun,\" says Stephen Carrick-Davies, of Childnet International, who wrote today's guide. \"It's a good way to relax and have fun. We don't say that chat rooms should be shut down. They are here to stay and they have good educational opportunities. \"But the key thing that parents need to be aware of is that children have to lie to get online. It only works by giving an alias.\" This means that people can pose as anyone else. I could call myself Bugs Bunny in a chat room. The potential for disaster is becoming clearer. According to an NOP poll last November, almost 5m seven-to-16-year-olds in the UK use the internet and a quarter of those use chat rooms. But 10% have heard things in these rooms that embarrassed or upset them. The main danger is that an adult may try to develop an inappropriate relationship offline with a child. Last October, Patrick Green, 33, a divorced exports clerk from Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire, was sentenced to a five-year jail term for abusing a 13-year-old girl. He had met her in a chat room called Younger Girls for Older Men and exchanged messages with her for two months before meeting her. He was arrested in Cumbria on his way to meet another 14-year-old girl he had met online and arranged to spend a weekend with. Judge Christopher Tyrer described him as a \"predator\" and ordered him to remain on the sex offenders' register for life. Childnet is now lobbying the government to make enticement on the internet a recognised crime. Last month, seven members of a global child pornography ring were jailed for distributing more than 750,000 images of child sex abuse. The club, which police believe had been operating for at least five years, required new members to provide 10,000 new images of child pornography as an entry fee. The Wonderland Club involved the rape of boys and girls live on camera and the torture of children as young as two months. The images were so appalling that the National Crime Squad officers who had to look through them had compulsory counselling. To date, only two of the 1,236 Wonderland victims have been traced. It is feared that one of the two has been murdered. Police and probation officers now fear that a wave of internet porn is sweeping the country, encouraged by light sentencing, some as lenient as 80 hours' community service. A financial adviser earning \u00a3100,000 a year recently received a three month prison sentence when police discovered that he often spent 18 hours a day downloading obscene images from the net. But, says Carrick-Davies, the guidelines are not a knee-jerk reaction. \"There are wonderful things that children can pick up in chat rooms. It introduces them to other cultures. However, we need to put the dangers in context. \"We are not saying the internet is evil and we must shut it down. We want to portray the brighter things but we want to say there is a dark side and these are the types of steps you can take to ensure that your children are really safe.\" The guidelines 1. Is the chat room moderated? 2. Who are the moderators? 3. Has the chat room got a clear terms and conditions policy? 4. Does the chat room have a clear topic/subject timetable? 5. Does the chat room have advertising or external links? 6. Does the chat room give young people genuine opportunities for students to interact and shape the chat? 7. Does the chat room have appropriate access control and password verification? Can anyone join? 8. Does the chat room remind users about safety issues?",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's desperate attempts to assure foreign visitors Britain is not \"closed for business\" will be reinforced with a \u00a310m global advertising campaign about the foot and mouth crisis. The British Tourist Authority, the body responsible for promoting UK tourism abroad, is preparing the campaign in a bid to stop the economic crisis in rural areas deepening. With large swathes of Britain already closed to the public, the government is getting increasingly concerned foreign tourists will stay away. In the Commons yesterday Mr Blair said postponing the May 3 local elections would send out a signal that Britain was \"closed for business\", damaging a tourist industry already hard hit by the crisis. The government today launched a press and radio public information campaign in England and Wales setting out rules for visiting the countryside and how to access further guidance. The crisis now threatens the start of the tourist season at Easter. Last year overseas tourism generated \u00a3863m in March and \u00a31.1bn in April. But it could be another month until the campaign launches, with campaign strategy unlikely to be finalised until the end of next week. The BTA is seeking to appoint a marketing consultant and advertising agency to produce the campaign. A spokesman for the BTA said the information-based campaign will attempt to allay confusion about foot and mouth for tourists and show there are many attractions open in the UK. But he said a campaign to restore the reputation of the country as a tourist destination will not be viable until the crisis nears its end. Tourism minister Janet Anderson has been visiting the US to calm holidaymakers' fears about visiting the UK. The BTA's US offices have taken calls from tourists confusing foot and mouth with BSE and are asking if they need to bring their own food to the country.

      "bodyText": "In a court case almost as labyrinthine and complex as his finest films, and costing just as much, the director Francis Ford Coppola has lost a multimillion-dollar battle with Warner Brothers over the making of a film about Pinocchio. The case is seen as a precedent to what constitutes an agreement between a film company and a director. Three judges of the California court of appeals sitting in Los Angeles ruled that Warner Brothers was entitled to tell its rivals at Columbia that it already had rights to a Coppola film of Pinocchio, thus warning them off. The ruling means that Coppola loses a $20m (\u00a314m) award he was given by a jury in 1998. The saga dates back to 1992 when Coppola, now 61 and the maker of such films as the Godfather series and Apocalypse Now, signed a certificate of employment with Warner Brothers, who hoped to make a live action film of the tale. But the film did not go ahead, and in 1994 Coppola entered discussions with Columbia. Warner Brothers fired off a letter to its rivals informing them that it already had rights to a Coppola film. Columbia did not make its planned film, and in 1995 Coppola sued Warner Brothers for \"tortious interference\". In 1998 a jury awarded Coppola $80m against Warner Brothers - $60m in punitive damages and $20m in compensation. It decided that Warner Brothers had falsely claimed to have a deal, thus depriving Coppola of his chance to make the film with Columbia. A judge later dismissed the $60m but left Coppola with $20m in compensatory damages. Warner Brothers appealed against the ruling and Coppola also appealed to have the $60m award restored. Now the appeals court has decided against Coppola on both counts. In an 18-page ruling, the court said the Warner Brothers letter did not give grounds for an action. \"We conclude that a reasonable attorney, considering the facts before the court, would believe that Warner had a legally tenable claim in any Coppola Pinocchio project and that such claim was not totally and completely without merit,\" the judges said. Warner Brothers had spent around $350,000 on the film and had worked for about two years with Coppola on the project. Fred Cohen, of Horvitz and Levy, who handled the appeal for Warner Brothers, told the Hollywood Reporter: \"The studios are going to be very relieved by this decision. After the jury's verdict, people were nervous about sending these kinds of letters putting others on notice of their rights. This opinion says they don't need to worry about trying to resolve matters informally without a lawsuit.\" Variety headlined its report of ruling \"Francis Floored\". Coppola's lawyer, Robert Chapman, said he believed that the jury had made the correct decision. The case will now go to the supreme court, a lengthy procedure. There are various screen versions of Pinocchio, the most famous being the 1940 Oscar-winning Walt Disney film. A sequel, Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night, was made in 1987 and a live action version, The Adventures of Pinocchio, directed by Steve Barron, appeared in 1996 in a New Line production with Martin Landau, Jonathon Taylor Thomas, Dawn French and Griff Rhys Jones. In a Japanese sci-fi film called 964 Pinocchio the hero is a sex slave.",

      "body": "<p>Sharp at four on a sunny winter's afternoon, the Guardian turns up with Tony Benn on the doorstep of Sir Edward Heath's London home, a terraced Belgravia house within sight of the garden wall of Buckingham Palace. It may seem an unlikely meeting, but the two have shared the past half-century in parliament. And when the coming election is called, both will retire from the Commons. Neither will go to the Lords.</p> <p>Heath, the former Conservative prime minister (1970-74) and bete noire of the Tory right, was first elected for Bexley - now Old Bexley and Sidcup - in the general election of February 23 1950. Unlike Benn, he has unbroken service. The Labour ex-cabinet minister (1964-70 and 1974-79) reached the Commons via a byelection in Bristol South East a few months later, but briefly lost his seat twice.</p> <p>Though Heath, at 84, is the elder by nine years and has always been the more senior politician, their paths have crossed many times during careers of great influence on our times. My plan is to explore the changes they have seen in the past 50 years.</p> <p>Both veterans have just come from the now-weekly session of prime minister's question time. \"My God, it is awful now, isn't it,\" says Heath, by way of an opener. \"I'm afraid I dozed off,\" confesses Benn. \"I've done it once or twice now. I can't bear it.\"</p> <p>They agree about much of what is wrong: they both dislike the replacement of 15-minute sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays with Blair's single 30 minutes on Wednesdays, just as they disliked the move in the 60s from specific questions to general ones designed to trip up the PM rather than elicit a detailed answer.</p> <p>As to how to remedy the problem - or others we discuss - there is rather less agreement, though outright disagreement is politely avoided. It is just possible to imagine that the former Viscount Stansgate regards the former Mr Heath as a technocrat at heart, not very interested in the democratic questions that preoccupy him; and that, in return, Benn is regarded as a bit of a gadfly.</p> <p>But it is all very polite, a bit like watching the great theatrical knights in old age - Olivier, Gielgud or Richardson - circling each other's eminence on the stage, warily but not unkindly. The unspoken eloquence of their pauses is worthy of Pinter himself.</p> <p>They agree that 1956 was a turning point in postwar history, chiefly because the US thwarted the secret Anglo-French plan to recapture the newly nationalised Suez Canal by invading Egypt in collusion with Israel. As chief whip, Heath was one of just four British ministers in the know.</p> <p>By 1956, Winston Churchill, who liked Heath enough to give him two of his own paintings (they hang on the wall of his other home in Salisbury), had finally retired as prime minister at 80. Anthony Eden, his dashing, doomed successor, wanted to make his mark. \"Some of us understood it beforehand and always believed he [Eden] was wrong in what he was doing,\" says Heath. \"I told him so privately; never discussed it publicly. But he didn't share that view, so they carried on. By the end of it [when US pressure on sterling forced a withdrawal from the canal after six days] Macmillan [then chancellor] certainly realised it meant the end of that period. That is why he supported our entry into Europe in 1961.\"</p> <p>He does not have time to add that President De Gaulle of France vetoed his own efforts to negotiate British entry into the then four-year-old European common market, and that he only got us in when he was prime minister 12 years later. Benn intervenes: \"Because he [Macmillan] saw the Americans let us down. I went to see Walter Monckton [minister of labour] privately at the time of Suez to see if he could head it off. Collusion was the thing, the deal between the French and British; it was the first time since the war or subsequently when the American president simply vetoed a British manoeuvre.\"</p> <p>As ever, Benn is making contemporary political points. He points out that in the 60s Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, had refused US appeals to send a token British force to fight in Vietnam. \"But otherwise, am I wrong in saying all British governments since 1945 have done what the Americans wanted ?\"</p> <p>\"I wouldn't go that far,\" replies Heath, who rarely goes as far as Benn. \"On Vietnam I wouldn't play with them either. I didn't play with Kissinger over India [the 1971 war with Pakistan], where he wanted us to go in. And I didn't play when he wanted to go into Cyprus, when he wanted to go in with the Israeli [Yom Kippur] war.\"</p> <p>In its efforts to re-equip the Israeli armed forces, the US was forced to fly supplies in via the Azores: retaliation for the Suez affair, one might be tempted to murmur. Heath does not. He is busy recalling the speech he made at President Richard Nixon's side on the White House lawn at that time. \"My remark was that there is no special relationship between Britain and the United States. What there was, was an historic relationship that was much stronger. A special relationship you can break up at any time if you reach a stage of disagreement. An historic relationship is there all the time.\"</p> <p>Again, the reproach to less perceptive successors hangs in the air, unstated. Benn is less reticent. \"We do not have an independent [nuclear] deterrent,\" he interjects. \"Americans lend us Trident, the United States controls our intelligence. If we were to go against American policy we would be seen to be a non-nuclear power. If we are locked into star wars [President Bush's missile defence plan] against the opposition of most of the countries of Europe, this is going to test the nuclear relationship to the full.\"</p> <p>These questions have a habit of coming full circle. Benn, who addresses his old rival as Ted (a gesture that is not reciprocated), remembers daring to ask Churchill a question about nuclear relations with the US in the early 50s and being ticked off by Clem Attlee, the former prime minister. \"You shouldn't have asked that question, because I'm the only one who knows anything about it,\" the party leader told him.</p> <p>\"But that was real. Something else is happening which is more fundamental than the points Ted is mentioning. Modern politics is about the marketing of personalities. We are invited to be spectators of what the great and the good do. I think that has infected the house,\" says Benn. \"I agree with Ted, PM's questions are awful. It could easily be stopped if the prime minister, when he got to a question from the leader of the opposition, said, 'That's an interesting point. I will have a look.' The whole thing would collapse.\"</p> <p>It is not that they are against progress. They both think the modern select committee system is an important development and are glad that MPs are better paid (until the 60s they paid for their own stamps) and have staff and offices in which to work - although it diminishes the collegiate atmosphere, the time MPs used to spend together simply talking. One problem, says Heath, is that MPs come in expecting to be ministers within three years. His old patron, Harold Macmillan (PM from 1957 to 1963) waited 17 years before he got a job, he says. But you were made a whip within a year of being elected, I counter, and were chief whip by 1955. \"Eleven months, I was very quick,\" he concedes, without the need for further justification.</p> <p>\"I had to wait 14 years,\" interjects Benn. \"You were a whip under Winston, were you?\"</p> <p>Heath: \"Yes, I was.\"</p> <p>Benn: \"Well, there you are.\"</p> <p>Benn then complains that ministers spend \"less and less time dealing with executive matters, and just go round opening things and closing things and tripping up over things and all the rest of it\". \"Pure propaganda,\" says Heath, which brings Benn around to his childhood in a political household (his father had also been a cabinet minister), watching the rise of Hitler.</p> <p>\"I bought Mein Kampf when I was about eight and I still read it. It's an astonishing book. He said democracy inevitably leads to Marxism. Work that one out!\" His point is that \"if you don't do people justice, they'll go for a demagogue. Any nation that loses confidence in democracy will be seduced. That's the thing that makes me worry about the fall in turnout in America.\" He mentions the Nuremberg rallies.</p> <p>Heath remains silent. As an Oxford student of modest origins and progressive instincts, he took himself off to Germany to inspect Hitler at close quarters. Making his way to Nuremberg in 1937, his memoirs report, he witnessed the F\u00fchrer walking to the podium, \"his shoulder brushing mine as he went past\". \"This experience subsequently dominated my political life,\" Heath would one day write, confirming him as an anti-appeaser, later (after he had returned to Germany in battle) as a passionate European, convinced that only a Europe \"united, free and democratic\" would be safe from the demons of ultranationalism.</p> <p>The conversation moves on. But we come back to it via what both the old warriors agree is a disturbing tendency towards global interventionism by the US, with Britain tagging along in its wake.</p> <p>Heath: \"What is happening alarms me because this Labour government is jumping back 50 years and trying to exert its influence in the world in what is really a colonial atmosphere and system ... There was a parliamentary commission which went out to China and produced a report which was really incredible. It was a report of a colonial power telling its colony what it's got to do. The way we have [also] intervened in Sierra Leone is really colonial.\"</p> <p>\"I agree with Ted,\" says Benn. \"Just as the 19th century was characterised by the British empire and the 21st by the American empire, that is domination of a military kind nobody has ever contemplated. Britain is now piggy-backing on American power to pretend we have the power. We don't have the power to do anything about Saddam Hussein.\"</p> <p>Benn sees Britain trying to find a place in a changing world. \"On Europe I understand exactly what Ted feels; I respect him; he's been consistent. He saw wars that split Europe, that destroyed it, and wants to bring it together. No nonsense about convergence criteria [for entry into the euro]. To him it's a political thing.</p> <p>\"If only we could explore the options without it being said that Ted wants the Brussels commission to give instructions to every parking meter. Or that he says we are anti-European, which I'm not. Let's have a rational debate, if only the House of Commons could have a serious debate about Europe.\"</p> <p>Heath: \"All my debate is rational.\"</p> <p>Benn: \"I know, Ted. I have never doubted you were - are - a model for us all.\"</p> <p>Heath perks up. He recently spent a fruitful day discussing Europe with Oxford dons. \"The fact is it is a political question, first and foremost. But what we have to realise is that we can't stand outside and keep saying we are going to come in,\" he says sharply. \"And Blair made this ghastly mistake, he went on and on. And finally the German chancellor blew up and said, 'Prime minister, this is our union and we decide what will happen. And you can't do it for us. That was when Blair took his first crack and he's been mainly quiet since then.\"</p> <p>Going into Europe late and then telling them what to do \"drove them absolutely mad. I didn't do it; that's why I'm still respected in most of Europe. I recognised that you have got to show them that you are part of them before you can start influencing them in a particular direction.\"</p> <p>Benn starts to intervene, then Heath asks him his only direct question of the session. \"Does your prime minister really think he has got his party lined up ?\"</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" Benn replies. \"If you want advice about the prime minister's thoughts, don't come to me. I am not privy.\"</p> <p>The Blair cabinet \"are under tremendous pressure, to which they give way the whole time, from the press,\" says Heath. This is one of his recurrent dislikes because what he sometimes calls the \"foreign-owned press\" (Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black) are so hostile to Europe.</p> <p>I ask what is wrong with the press. \"Everything. We have the worst press in the world; the people who have now captured the press are of that calibre, that outlook. I had lunch with one of its editors a short time ago and said, 'You know, it's the influence of the owners and editors on the press that is causing the trouble.' He said, 'The public take it from us, not you.' \"</p> <p>\"Like the medieval church,\" chips in Benn. Heath says he doesn't want to discuss individuals - and then does. \"If you take the question of Murdoch, he declared that he was supporting the Labour party and, if you look at his papers, they couldn't be more opposed, supporting the Tory party indirectly.\"</p> <p>Benn says he is constantly amazed at the media's failure to report what matters to the people who turn up at public meetings. \"I have done five with over 1,000 people, on Palestine, the sale of council houses, cuts in Hackney, globalisation.\" And he contradicts Heath's notion that, in the good old days, Lords Beaverbrook and Northcliffe separated the news from the comment columns. \"A slightly dreamy view of the past,\" he ventures.</p> <p>I ask Heath if the press and electorate should have been told when Churchill suffered a stroke in 1953 while he was still in charge. It elicits a very Heath-ish: \"No, why should you have done?\" As with Suez, very few were in the know, including both the Queen and Heath, as deputy chief whip. \"We were able to handle the situation extremely well.\" And Churchill recovered. \"I shall never forget the party conference at Margate. We had this great rally and there was Winston. The chief whip sat behind him and the speech went splendidly. Then we got to this thing where he turned over the page and started reading the same thing again.</p> <p>\"The chief whip looked at me and said, 'Sorry, this is the end.' But Churchill then said, 'I seem to have heard this somewhere before. Perhaps I should turn on.' So he turned over the page and went on. He lasted 18 months after that.\"</p> <p>When I later telephone Heath to clarify a few points, I ask what his most important achievements were. Getting into Europe he calls only \"a major achievement\", which surprises me. He rattles off reform of the tax system; freeing up the housing market to cope with modern needs; the abortive 1971 Industrial Relations Act, a better deal for the unions that broke it than they got from the next Tory government. There were also changes to the immigration laws that, he says, stopped the issue being a \"continuous sore\" - a reference to Enoch Powell, whom he bravely sacked for his \"rivers of blood\" speech in 1968.</p> <p>Benn's answer to the same question on the phone is that he is glad to have campaigned early for reforms that eventually prevailed - \"acorns which became trees\", as he puts it. Lords reform, of course; freedom of information; gay rights; a trade boycott against apartheid South Africa. Even public ownership is creeping back into fashion, he suggests. \"I get letters from people who say, 'I have never agreed with a word you said in your life, Mr Benn,' but then proceed to repeat what I said. You are glad you didn't give up when everyone else gave up.\"</p> <p>Great figures of their time? I ask them both. This is a hard one for politicians, among whom - even the most virtuous - ego is a significant component in any 50-year career. Heath does not mention you-know-who, his nemesis from Finchley. But he is loyal to his friends. \"Eden has been underestimated because of Suez. What he did in the 30s and early 50s [as foreign secretary] was excellent diplomacy.\" As for Macmillan, \"opinions differ; most of it is wrong\". But his stock too will recover.</p> <p>Benn deplores personality politics, though he has a formidable political personality himself. So he cites speeches instead: Nye Bevan on western rearmament in the 50s, warning that it would lead to a witchhunt against socialists; the young Iain Macleod (who died after three weeks as Heath's chancellor in 1970) famously attacking the great Nye in his maiden speech. Powell was \"always worth listening to. People said he had the best mind in parliament until he made it up.\" In 1968 even Robert Maxwell had made a brilliant speech on the Soviet invasion of his native Czechoslovakia. \"People listened, as they did to an ex-miner talking about a pit disaster, because he spoke from his own experience.\"</p> <p>Which is why, when Heath and Benn rise, as they shortly will, to make valedictory Commons speeches, old friends and enemies alike will sit quietly and listen. Churchill and Nye, Mao and Nixon, Khrushchev and De Gaulle - a major link between the Commons and its past is about to be severed. Who else can still claim to have brushed shoulders with Hitler?</p> <p><a name=\"A\"><b>Audio clips</b><br></a><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/heathbenn1.ra\">On prime minister's question time (16 sec)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/heathbenn2.ra\">On the pressures of the media (1min 13)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/heathbenn3.ra\">On New Labour (40 sec)</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Tories\">Tories in opposition</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/parl/\">Life in parliament</a></p>",

The Labour ex-cabinet minister (1964-70 and 1974-79) reached the Commons via a byelection in Bristol South East a few months later, but briefly lost his seat twice. Though Heath, at 84, is the elder by nine years and has always been the more senior politician, their paths have crossed many times during careers of great influence on our times. My plan is to explore the changes they have seen in the past 50 years. Both veterans have just come from the now-weekly session of prime minister's question time. \"My God, it is awful now, isn't it,\" says Heath, by way of an opener. \"I'm afraid I dozed off,\" confesses Benn. \"I've done it once or twice now. I can't bear it.\" They agree about much of what is wrong: they both dislike the replacement of 15-minute sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays with Blair's single 30 minutes on Wednesdays, just as they disliked the move in the 60s from specific questions to general ones designed to trip up the PM rather than elicit a detailed answer. As to how to remedy the problem - or others we discuss - there is rather less agreement, though outright disagreement is politely avoided. It is just possible to imagine that the former Viscount Stansgate regards the former Mr Heath as a technocrat at heart, not very interested in the democratic questions that preoccupy him; and that, in return, Benn is regarded as a bit of a gadfly. But it is all very polite, a bit like watching the great theatrical knights in old age - Olivier, Gielgud or Richardson - circling each other's eminence on the stage, warily but not unkindly. The unspoken eloquence of their pauses is worthy of Pinter himself. They agree that 1956 was a turning point in postwar history, chiefly because the US thwarted the secret Anglo-French plan to recapture the newly nationalised Suez Canal by invading Egypt in collusion with Israel. As chief whip, Heath was one of just four British ministers in the know. By 1956, Winston Churchill, who liked Heath enough to give him two of his own paintings (they hang on the wall of his other home in Salisbury), had finally retired as prime minister at 80. Anthony Eden, his dashing, doomed successor, wanted to make his mark. \"Some of us understood it beforehand and always believed he [Eden] was wrong in what he was doing,\" says Heath. \"I told him so privately; never discussed it publicly. But he didn't share that view, so they carried on. By the end of it [when US pressure on sterling forced a withdrawal from the canal after six days] Macmillan [then chancellor] certainly realised it meant the end of that period. That is why he supported our entry into Europe in 1961.\" He does not have time to add that President De Gaulle of France vetoed his own efforts to negotiate British entry into the then four-year-old European common market, and that he only got us in when he was prime minister 12 years later. Benn intervenes: \"Because he [Macmillan] saw the Americans let us down. I went to see Walter Monckton [minister of labour] privately at the time of Suez to see if he could head it off. Collusion was the thing, the deal between the French and British; it was the first time since the war or subsequently when the American president simply vetoed a British manoeuvre.\" As ever, Benn is making contemporary political points. He points out that in the 60s Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, had refused US appeals to send a token British force to fight in Vietnam. \"But otherwise, am I wrong in saying all British governments since 1945 have done what the Americans wanted ?\" \"I wouldn't go that far,\" replies Heath, who rarely goes as far as Benn. \"On Vietnam I wouldn't play with them either. I didn't play with Kissinger over India [the 1971 war with Pakistan], where he wanted us to go in. And I didn't play when he wanted to go into Cyprus, when he wanted to go in with the Israeli [Yom Kippur] war.\" In its efforts to re-equip the Israeli armed forces, the US was forced to fly supplies in via the Azores: retaliation for the Suez affair, one might be tempted to murmur. Heath does not. He is busy recalling the speech he made at President Richard Nixon's side on the White House lawn at that time. \"My remark was that there is no special relationship between Britain and the United States. What there was, was an historic relationship that was much stronger. A special relationship you can break up at any time if you reach a stage of disagreement. An historic relationship is there all the time.\" Again, the reproach to less perceptive successors hangs in the air, unstated. Benn is less reticent. \"We do not have an independent [nuclear] deterrent,\" he interjects. \"Americans lend us Trident, the United States controls our intelligence. If we were to go against American policy we would be seen to be a non-nuclear power. If we are locked into star wars [President Bush's missile defence plan] against the opposition of most of the countries of Europe, this is going to test the nuclear relationship to the full.\" These questions have a habit of coming full circle. Benn, who addresses his old rival as Ted (a gesture that is not reciprocated), remembers daring to ask Churchill a question about nuclear relations with the US in the early 50s and being ticked off by Clem Attlee, the former prime minister. \"You shouldn't have asked that question, because I'm the only one who knows anything about it,\" the party leader told him. \"But that was real. Something else is happening which is more fundamental than the points Ted is mentioning. Modern politics is about the marketing of personalities. We are invited to be spectators of what the great and the good do. I think that has infected the house,\" says Benn. \"I agree with Ted, PM's questions are awful. It could easily be stopped if the prime minister, when he got to a question from the leader of the opposition, said, 'That's an interesting point. I will have a look.' The whole thing would collapse.\" It is not that they are against progress. They both think the modern select committee system is an important development and are glad that MPs are better paid (until the 60s they paid for their own stamps) and have staff and offices in which to work - although it diminishes the collegiate atmosphere, the time MPs used to spend together simply talking. One problem, says Heath, is that MPs come in expecting to be ministers within three years. His old patron, Harold Macmillan (PM from 1957 to 1963) waited 17 years before he got a job, he says. But you were made a whip within a year of being elected, I counter, and were chief whip by 1955. \"Eleven months, I was very quick,\" he concedes, without the need for further justification. \"I had to wait 14 years,\" interjects Benn. \"You were a whip under Winston, were you?\" Heath: \"Yes, I was.\" Benn: \"Well, there you are.\" Benn then complains that ministers spend \"less and less time dealing with executive matters, and just go round opening things and closing things and tripping up over things and all the rest of it\". \"Pure propaganda,\" says Heath, which brings Benn around to his childhood in a political household (his father had also been a cabinet minister), watching the rise of Hitler. \"I bought Mein Kampf when I was about eight and I still read it. It's an astonishing book. He said democracy inevitably leads to Marxism. Work that one out!\" His point is that \"if you don't do people justice, they'll go for a demagogue. Any nation that loses confidence in democracy will be seduced. That's the thing that makes me worry about the fall in turnout in America.\" He mentions the Nuremberg rallies. Heath remains silent. As an Oxford student of modest origins and progressive instincts, he took himself off to Germany to inspect Hitler at close quarters. Making his way to Nuremberg in 1937, his memoirs report, he witnessed the F\u00fchrer walking to the podium, \"his shoulder brushing mine as he went past\". \"This experience subsequently dominated my political life,\" Heath would one day write, confirming him as an anti-appeaser, later (after he had returned to Germany in battle) as a passionate European, convinced that only a Europe \"united, free and democratic\" would be safe from the demons of ultranationalism. The conversation moves on. But we come back to it via what both the old warriors agree is a disturbing tendency towards global interventionism by the US, with Britain tagging along in its wake. Heath: \"What is happening alarms me because this Labour government is jumping back 50 years and trying to exert its influence in the world in what is really a colonial atmosphere and system ... There was a parliamentary commission which went out to China and produced a report which was really incredible. It was a report of a colonial power telling its colony what it's got to do. The way we have [also] intervened in Sierra Leone is really colonial.\" \"I agree with Ted,\" says Benn. \"Just as the 19th century was characterised by the British empire and the 21st by the American empire, that is domination of a military kind nobody has ever contemplated. Britain is now piggy-backing on American power to pretend we have the power. We don't have the power to do anything about Saddam Hussein.\" Benn sees Britain trying to find a place in a changing world. \"On Europe I understand exactly what Ted feels; I respect him; he's been consistent. He saw wars that split Europe, that destroyed it, and wants to bring it together. No nonsense about convergence criteria [for entry into the euro]. To him it's a political thing. \"If only we could explore the options without it being said that Ted wants the Brussels commission to give instructions to every parking meter. Or that he says we are anti-European, which I'm not. Let's have a rational debate, if only the House of Commons could have a serious debate about Europe.\" Heath: \"All my debate is rational.\" Benn: \"I know, Ted. I have never doubted you were - are - a model for us all.\" Heath perks up. He recently spent a fruitful day discussing Europe with Oxford dons. \"The fact is it is a political question, first and foremost. But what we have to realise is that we can't stand outside and keep saying we are going to come in,\" he says sharply. \"And Blair made this ghastly mistake, he went on and on. And finally the German chancellor blew up and said, 'Prime minister, this is our union and we decide what will happen. And you can't do it for us. That was when Blair took his first crack and he's been mainly quiet since then.\" Going into Europe late and then telling them what to do \"drove them absolutely mad. I didn't do it; that's why I'm still respected in most of Europe. I recognised that you have got to show them that you are part of them before you can start influencing them in a particular direction.\" Benn starts to intervene, then Heath asks him his only direct question of the session. \"Does your prime minister really think he has got his party lined up ?\" \"I don't know,\" Benn replies. \"If you want advice about the prime minister's thoughts, don't come to me. I am not privy.\" The Blair cabinet \"are under tremendous pressure, to which they give way the whole time, from the press,\" says Heath. This is one of his recurrent dislikes because what he sometimes calls the \"foreign-owned press\" (Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black) are so hostile to Europe. I ask what is wrong with the press. \"Everything. We have the worst press in the world; the people who have now captured the press are of that calibre, that outlook. I had lunch with one of its editors a short time ago and said, 'You know, it's the influence of the owners and editors on the press that is causing the trouble.' He said, 'The public take it from us, not you.' \" \"Like the medieval church,\" chips in Benn. Heath says he doesn't want to discuss individuals - and then does. \"If you take the question of Murdoch, he declared that he was supporting the Labour party and, if you look at his papers, they couldn't be more opposed, supporting the Tory party indirectly.\" Benn says he is constantly amazed at the media's failure to report what matters to the people who turn up at public meetings. \"I have done five with over 1,000 people, on Palestine, the sale of council houses, cuts in Hackney, globalisation.\" And he contradicts Heath's notion that, in the good old days, Lords Beaverbrook and Northcliffe separated the news from the comment columns. \"A slightly dreamy view of the past,\" he ventures. I ask Heath if the press and electorate should have been told when Churchill suffered a stroke in 1953 while he was still in charge. It elicits a very Heath-ish: \"No, why should you have done?\" As with Suez, very few were in the know, including both the Queen and Heath, as deputy chief whip. \"We were able to handle the situation extremely well.\" And Churchill recovered. \"I shall never forget the party conference at Margate. We had this great rally and there was Winston. The chief whip sat behind him and the speech went splendidly. Then we got to this thing where he turned over the page and started reading the same thing again. \"The chief whip looked at me and said, 'Sorry, this is the end.' But Churchill then said, 'I seem to have heard this somewhere before. Perhaps I should turn on.' So he turned over the page and went on. He lasted 18 months after that.\" When I later telephone Heath to clarify a few points, I ask what his most important achievements were. Getting into Europe he calls only \"a major achievement\", which surprises me. He rattles off reform of the tax system; freeing up the housing market to cope with modern needs; the abortive 1971 Industrial Relations Act, a better deal for the unions that broke it than they got from the next Tory government. There were also changes to the immigration laws that, he says, stopped the issue being a \"continuous sore\" - a reference to Enoch Powell, whom he bravely sacked for his \"rivers of blood\" speech in 1968. Benn's answer to the same question on the phone is that he is glad to have campaigned early for reforms that eventually prevailed - \"acorns which became trees\", as he puts it. Lords reform, of course; freedom of information; gay rights; a trade boycott against apartheid South Africa. Even public ownership is creeping back into fashion, he suggests. \"I get letters from people who say, 'I have never agreed with a word you said in your life, Mr Benn,' but then proceed to repeat what I said. You are glad you didn't give up when everyone else gave up.\" Great figures of their time? I ask them both. This is a hard one for politicians, among whom - even the most virtuous - ego is a significant component in any 50-year career. Heath does not mention you-know-who, his nemesis from Finchley. But he is loyal to his friends. \"Eden has been underestimated because of Suez. What he did in the 30s and early 50s [as foreign secretary] was excellent diplomacy.\" As for Macmillan, \"opinions differ; most of it is wrong\". But his stock too will recover. Benn deplores personality politics, though he has a formidable political personality himself. So he cites speeches instead: Nye Bevan on western rearmament in the 50s, warning that it would lead to a witchhunt against socialists; the young Iain Macleod (who died after three weeks as Heath's chancellor in 1970) famously attacking the great Nye in his maiden speech. Powell was \"always worth listening to. People said he had the best mind in parliament until he made it up.\" In 1968 even Robert Maxwell had made a brilliant speech on the Soviet invasion of his native Czechoslovakia. \"People listened, as they did to an ex-miner talking about a pit disaster, because he spoke from his own experience.\" Which is why, when Heath and Benn rise, as they shortly will, to make valedictory Commons speeches, old friends and enemies alike will sit quietly and listen. Churchill and Nye, Mao and Nixon, Khrushchev and De Gaulle - a major link between the Commons and its past is about to be severed. Who else can still claim to have brushed shoulders with Hitler?

      "bodyText": "Cable operator Telewest has left a nightmare year behind after reporting results that were ahead of market expectations. The UK's second largest cable company reported widening losses for 2000 after making the painful transformation into a digital business, but climbed above analysts' earnings targets. Adam Singer, chief executive of Telewest, said the company was on the right track following a year of acquisitions and management changes. \"If Telewest were human, it would have been the equivalent of changing jobs, moving house, getting married and giving birth all in one year. It was a tough year but the results show that we made it,\" he said. Earnings before interest, taxes, amortisation and depreciation rose 11% to \u00a3247m, topping forecasts and supplying some good news for the UK cable industry. Telewest confirmed it had reached its target of 500,000 digital subscribers this month, up from 377,000 at the end of last year. It did not give a goal for the rest of the year. The all-important churn rate figure, or the proportion of customers who leave the service, fell 2.7% to 26% after the company revamped its much-maligned customer service operations. Despite the improvement in churn, analysts will want to see that figure fall further and are hoping for fewer technical faults with the digital service. Mr Singer also promised there would be no repeat of the disastrous events that hit the company last year, when a shortage of components for set-top boxes paralysed its digital service. \"The set-top box supply problems that caused us to pause our marketing last summer are history,\" added Mr Singer. But the pre-tax loss for 2000 deepened from \u00a3530m to \u00a3701m, due to the cost of buying pay-TV company Flextech and rival firm Eurobell and the launch of the digital service. Telewest recently shored up its growing debt - which now stands at \u00a34.4bn - by restructuring its overdraft facilities However, Telewest delivered strong revenue growth, climbing 42% to \u00a31.1bn. Cable is a potential money-spinner, as it can offer \"bundled\" services which combine telephone, internet and digital through a single cable line. But in terms of their digital services, Telewest and close rival NTL remain far behind BSkyB, which has over 4.6m customers, and ONdigital, which has just over 1m. NTL has set itself a target of 1.25m digital subscribers for its digitalplus service by the end of the year. Rumours of a merger between NTL and Telewest have become a stock market staple, but it is more likely that both companies will co-operate over joint purchasing of set-top boxes and approaching regulatory issues.",

Capital, home of Chris Tarrant and Dr Fox, said in a trading statement poor advertising revenues would produce a 10% fall in full-year profits. The news sparked a run on Capital's shares, which tumbled 22% to a two-year low of 192.5p by late morning. \"It is too early to forecast the level of profits for the year as a whole,\" Capital said in its statement. \"However, a continuation into the second half of the current conditions in our advertising markets would be likely to result in reported profits for the year being at least 10% lower than last year.\" The radio sector was thought to be well protected against an advertising downturn by some analysts. However, Capital is clearly facing a similar situation to that of ITV, which has been hit hard by an advertising slump. These fears filtered through to Capital's listed rivals, with shares in GWR falling 10% and Chrysalis down 3.4%. Radio shares have taken a battering over the past week as analysts voiced concerns that commercial stations were not taking enough audience share from the BBC. Instead, new commercial players are taking listeners away from older, more established rivals.

      "body": "<p>There've only been a few occasions when my surroundings have robbed me of the power of speech. I'm not talking about places that have evoked great solemnity, like Dachau or Kanchanaburi, or instances where fear took hold - but places where the sheer noise and level of activity induce a kind of temporary sensory overload. </p> <p>This eventuality has been largely confined to the day of arrival in certain \"Third World\" cities (Bangkok, Guanzhou and Varanasi all did it to me), but not exclusively. The same thing happened the first time I went to New York (1988), when, with two mates, I flew late into JFK, and then got an express bus to the \"delightful\" (least it was then) Port Authority Bus Terminal off 8th Avenue, arriving at about 11pm on a muggy June night. </p> <p>Suffice to say that 18 relatively tranquil years in Devon, or even 6 in Liverpool, had done nothing to prepare me for the assault on the senses that wandering blindly through a teeming mass of junkies, hookers, down-and-outs, pickpockets and neglected mental patients (all topped off by a screaming police siren soundtrack) provided. It was several hours before silent bewilderment gave way to a semblance of composure again.</p> <p>Anyway, this is turning into a long-winded yarning session, so we'll move straight to the next evening, when for want of anything better to do, we decided to go to a baseball match. No, not the Yankees, but the Mets at Shea Stadium. I had no preference at the time, just the Mets happened to be at home. Outside, stalls selling memorabilia (or monumental tat, if you'd prefer) lined the pavement. We stopped at one. Laid out were Mets baseball shirts, $25 dollars a shout.</p> <p>\"One of those please\", I said pointing.</p> <p>\"You don't want one a dose\", said the sharp eyed stall owner, clocking our accents, \"You want one a dees\", and he hauled a box of last year's stock up off the floor. </p> <p>\"Dees are special commemorative shoits\" he lied. \"Only thoity five dollars\".</p> <p>\"Great\", I said like the mug punter that I undoubtedly was. \"Here you go\".</p> <p>The interesting part, though, was when I asked if he had any Yankees gear too (cos I thought I might as well buy one of each).</p> <p>His mood darkened. </p> <p>\"Dose arrogant f'cks! I'd rather eat my own shit, than sell their stuff!

      "bodyText": "There've only been a few occasions when my surroundings have robbed me of the power of speech. I'm not talking about places that have evoked great solemnity, like Dachau or Kanchanaburi, or instances where fear took hold - but places where the sheer noise and level of activity induce a kind of temporary sensory overload. This eventuality has been largely confined to the day of arrival in certain \"Third World\" cities (Bangkok, Guanzhou and Varanasi all did it to me), but not exclusively. The same thing happened the first time I went to New York (1988), when, with two mates, I flew late into JFK, and then got an express bus to the \"delightful\" (least it was then) Port Authority Bus Terminal off 8th Avenue, arriving at about 11pm on a muggy June night. Suffice to say that 18 relatively tranquil years in Devon, or even 6 in Liverpool, had done nothing to prepare me for the assault on the senses that wandering blindly through a teeming mass of junkies, hookers, down-and-outs, pickpockets and neglected mental patients (all topped off by a screaming police siren soundtrack) provided. It was several hours before silent bewilderment gave way to a semblance of composure again. Anyway, this is turning into a long-winded yarning session, so we'll move straight to the next evening, when for want of anything better to do, we decided to go to a baseball match. No, not the Yankees, but the Mets at Shea Stadium. I had no preference at the time, just the Mets happened to be at home. Outside, stalls selling memorabilia (or monumental tat, if you'd prefer) lined the pavement. We stopped at one. Laid out were Mets baseball shirts, $25 dollars a shout. \"One of those please\", I said pointing. \"You don't want one a dose\", said the sharp eyed stall owner, clocking our accents, \"You want one a dees\", and he hauled a box of last year's stock up off the floor. \"Dees are special commemorative shoits\" he lied. \"Only thoity five dollars\". \"Great\", I said like the mug punter that I undoubtedly was. \"Here you go\". The interesting part, though, was when I asked if he had any Yankees gear too (cos I thought I might as well buy one of each). His mood darkened. \"Dose arrogant f'cks! I'd rather eat my own shit, than sell their stuff! Try one a dose udder guys\" he said, gesticulating at the other stall holders. Well, I did, and, after each hastily laying out a sprinkling of last year's Mets gear, when they saw us coming, with the original price replaced by something higher, they all said pretty much the same thing. Anyway, admittedly Shea Stadium was probably not the best location to canvass opinion on the Rags, sorry the Yankees, but interestingly I found the same sentiments expressed all over the States. The parallels between the \"pride of American baseball\" and the \"pride of Singapore Experience\" are remarkably alike. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it though, so I later went to see the Yankees as well, and, after buying a baseball cap this time, discovered that the similarities between the Rags and the NYY extended to inside the stadium as well. People eating popcorn, no atmosphere, long periods of silence and choreographed (there's that word again) cheering prompted by a giant electronic screen, that flashed up things like \"Go team go\" at periodic intervals. In fairness, the Mets experience was little better. Like all American sports, the condensed action on the telly is way more exciting than the stop-start, boring, commercial-breaked reality.

Manning Gottlieb Media has snatched the \u00a38.5m consolidated media buying and planning business for Virgin Megastores and V Shop from incumbent agency Media Planning.

      "bodyText": "Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh has withdrawn his book from the Commonwealth Writers competition because he objects to the idea of his work being classified as \"commonwealth literature\" when the prize is only open to books written in English. Ghosh announced his decision yesterday in a letter to The Times of India, in which he argued that the name \"Commonwealth\" for a literary or cultural grouping could \"only be a misnomer\" so long as it excluded the many languages that sustained the cultural and literary lives of those countries. The writer, whose book The Glass Palace was picked as the Eurasia regional winner and was eligible for the main \u00a310,000 prize, to be awarded in Ghana next month, said he had been unaware his work had been submitted for the competition by his publishers. \"So far as I can determine, The Glass Palace is eligible for the commonwealth prize partly because it was written in English and partly because I happen to belong to a region that was once conquered and ruled by imperial Britain. Of the many reasons why a book's merits may be recognised, these seem to be the least persuasive,\" he said. Ghosh, author of best-selling English novels including The Circle of Reason and The Shadow Lines, said he would be betraying the spirit of his latest work if he allowed it to become a part of \"that particular memorialisation of empire that passes under the rubric of the commonwealth\". While he was gratified that the jury had liked the book, an epic novel dealing with colonial rule in Burma and Britain, he was strongly opposed to being entered in the first place. Publisher HarperCollins UK admitted it was unaware of his views when it recommended the book for the prize. Diana Bailey, programme manager for the Commonwealth Foundation, said she felt Ghosh's view was a \"misunderstanding of what the modern Commonwealth prize meant\". But she added discussions were going on about including works not in English.",

He justified the use of privately-run units by saying that recent social services inspectorate reports had endorsed the quality of care in the independent sector.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Plans to triple the number of teenage criminals held in privately-run secure training centres were unveiled by the home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday in a \u00a3250m \"root and branch\" shake-up of the juvenile secure custody system. The four-year plan drawn up by the government's youth justice board, which will see the number of places for teenagers in privately-run prisons rise from 130 to more than 400, is designed to ensure that teenage girls are not held in adult prisons and that more 15- and 16-year-old boys are held outside the prison system. The shake-up of the juvenile custody system will also include 20 places to care for jailed young mothers and pregnant teenage offenders. The plan, to be implemented by the youth justice board, chaired by Lord Warner, aims to ensure that 80% of juvenile offenders are held within 50 miles of their homes. Lord Warner also confirmed that Portland young offenders' institution in Dorset will no longer hold anyone under the age 18 from April next year but insisted the change was to hold younger inmates closer to their homes rather than as a result of allegations of brutality over many years. More places are also expected to be used at Hollesley Bay Colony in Suffolk to reduce the pressure on the troubled Feltham young offenders' institution in west London. Although the number of places for teenage offenders is being increased in the private sector, ministers do not expect it to lead to more youngsters being held in custody. Mr Straw said the introduction of anintensive supervision and surveillance programme for hardcore teenage offenders, and better use of bail supervision schemes, should ensure that the overall number did not increase. The extra prison places no longer used for teenage offenders will accommodate adult prisoners. The programme will see an expansion of the existing private units at Rainsbrook, Northamptonshire (32 places), and at Medway, Kent (32 places), and new units at Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire (80 places), Brentwood, Essex (40 places), and at an unidentified site in north west England (60-80 places). The youth justice board is also trying to buy the former Glenthorne secure unit near Birmingham from the Department of Health to use as a 40-place detention and training centre, and is looking at several sites to provide a further 100 places in Wales. The effort will include a \u00a320m programme to improve education, training and other programmes. Lord Warner said he hoped the improved conditions would help reduce suicides. He justified the use of privately-run units by saying that recent social services inspectorate reports had endorsed the quality of care in the independent sector.",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, says he is sorry that British troops in Sierra Leone are refusing to serve under the UN flag. He has also questioned the value of Britain's much-trumpeted training of the Sierra Leone army. Asked by the Guardian if he was disappointed with Britain's refusal to wear UN colours, he said: \"Yes, I do think it would be preferable if they were operating under the UN flag given that Britain is a permanent member of the [security] council and Britain passed the resolution establishing the force in Sierra Leone.\" A handful of British officers are attached to the UN headquarters team in Sierra Leone but London has insisted on independence for its troops. Britain has 800 troops in the west African country, scaled back from the 5,500 it had there last year. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, has repeatedly called on Britain to join the UN force, claiming that refusal undermines the world body. Mr Annan, however, praised British forces for providing a \"big psychological boost\" to the UN force at a critical stage last year. \"They have been helpful, but it would have been ideal if they would have been under the UN,\" he added. The British troops are training government troops for a push into rebel-held territory. But UN military advisers have told Mr Annan that this training will not have much impact. \"You can give these recruits some rudimentary training, some very basic training, but you cannot train soldiers in six weeks and down the line they will have to be given further training,\" he said. UN officials are braced for a difficult and bloody campaign and stress that they need high-calibre soldiers to sustain the drive into rebel areas. Mr Annan said: \"I cannot say we are ready to do it today but, once we are up to strength, I think we will be able to work with the [Sierra Leone] government to expand its authority throughout the country.\" Mr Annan, expected to confirm in New York today that he will seek a second five-year term as secretary general, needs success in Sierra Leone to counter the damage done to the UN's reputation as a peacekeeper by the disasters in Rwanda and the Balkans, and the divisions within its Sierra Leone force. But the dominant issue on Mr Annan's agenda is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He was meeting the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, in New York last night, where he said he would urge Tel Aviv to end its economic embargo of Palestinian territories, and to drop the precondition of an end to violence before any talks with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Mr Annan, who is to attend an Arab summit in Jordan next week, said: \"Our recommendation is that Israel should ease the economic squeeze on the Palestinians and have both sides work together to decrease the violence.\" \"I know that prime minister Sharon is insisting that chairman Arafat must end the violence before he moves forward on other fronts. But these things are linked,\" he said. \"The longer this thing goes on the more radicalised and frustrated the Palestinians become and, of course, they also have a lot of support in the Arab world which tends to radicalise the Arab streets.\" He discerned two causes for the Arabs' radicalisation: the revived Palestinian uprising, and the continuing sanctions against Iraq. Mr Annan is optimistic that a deal on Iraq is possible this year if the US and Britain define the terms for lifting sanctions. He said that American and British bombing raids to enforce the continued imposition of no-fly zones had been high on the agenda when he met an Iraqi delegation last month. \"There are reviews going on of this Iraq policy among the council members [the US and Britain] and we will wait to see what the outcome of these will be.\"",

The News Corp chairman needs a US presence in his Sky Global Networks satellite TV company, which has interests in every major market apart from the US. However, analysts today said Mr Murdoch still had a chance, as US regulators would be very tough on a merger between Echostar and DirecTV. This could force the companies to abandon a deal.

      "bodyText": "Spain's dispute with Britain over Gibraltar was blamed by the European commission president Romano Prodi yesterday for blocking agreement on a \"single European sky\", where air traffic congestion and the delays and cost they inflict on travellers should be a thing of the past. Creating the single sky is one of Mr Prodi's aims for the EU economic summit which opens in Stockholm tomorrow, but he admitted yesterday that the row between London and Madrid would prevent it happening. Britain blames the Spanish EU transport commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, for implicitly recognising Spain's claim to the Rock by excluding its airport from the unified control system she has proposed rather than letting the two states work out an agreement. Britain and Spain dispute the status of the airport, which is build on reclaimed land not forming part of the original territory ceded to Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Spain does not recognise it as a regional airport. Mr Prodi said he had been forced to read the treaty in the original Latin to understand the row. \"Europeans need this [unified air control system], so we can get rid of delays and congestion,\" he said. Air traffic control problems are responsible for half the delays suffered by European fights. More than a quarter of flights within the union were delayed by more than 15 minutes last year. Current air traffic management is based on a fragmented patchwork of national air spaces, each with its own systems, standards and working practices \u0095 The home secretary, Jack Straw, signed a deal yesterday to speed up the extradition of British fugitives from Mediterranean hideaways in Spain. They could be returned in as little as three weeks. Thirty-six requests by Britain for the return of people accused of serious crimes, including terrorism, murder and drug-dealing, are outstanding.",

Chained has one man constantly tied to five women, with one of the latter thrown off the show each week until only two remain. The programme, which is fronted by former Big Brother housemate Melanie Hill, has already prompted one story in the Sun claiming the final remaining couple were filmed having sex. But the saucy subject matter has not yet translated into ratings, judging by the first two outings for Chained, which is broadcast on the Channel 4 pay-TV service from 11.10-11.55pm. On its Monday night debut Chained drew just 59,000 viewers and a 1.6% share of multi-channel viewing, according to unofficial overnights. But on its second outing last night the show's ratings slumped to just 16,000 and 0.4% of the available audience in multi-channel homes. Sky Premiere had more success on Saturday night with the first UK television airing for the digitally remastered version of Star Wars. The film, which will be followed on consecutive Saturdays by the three other Star Wars movies, was on between 8pm and 10.05pm and brought Sky Premiere its best audience so far this year. Star Wars, which has been retitled Star Wars IV: a New Hope following the release of prequel the Phantom Menace, had 1m viewers and a 9.8% share of multi-channel viewing. Sky Premiere's previous highest rating this year came from Will Smith movie Wild Wild West, which had 963,000 viewers when it premiered on February 24.

The ambitious plan will see the American fast food giant open up over 400 restaurants across France for two weeks starting this Sunday. Consumers will be given access to an exhaustive range of information on everything from McDonald's meat suppliers and the preparation of a burger to the way the company's PR agency has handled the crisis in public confidence. It is the first time McDonald's has ever embarked on such an ambitious PR exercise and the scale of the project is a sign of just how far the company's reputation has fallen in France. For many French people the golden arches have come to symbolise the destruction of French traditions. When Jose Bove, a cheese-maker from south-west France, vandalised a branch of McDonald's last year he became a national hero virtually overnight. \"We think the best way to restore public confidence is to be completely open about the way we work,\" said a McDonald's spokeswoman. \"We want consumers to get to know McDonald's better.

The decision will come as major relief for Ms Feltz, who became extremely distressed when she was nominated for eviction from the Big Brother House after just three days. Millions of viewers saw her crack under the pressure when she was nominated for eviction. She broke down in tears on several occasions; told Big Brother to \"fuck off\" and scrawled a series of words including \"frustrated\" and \"incarcerated\" on the kitchen table. Although her fellow inmates appeared to cope better under the constant spotlight, they will be just as thankful that their most vulnerable moments will not be recorded in the annals of TV history. Anthea Turner was visibly upset when she was nominated for eviction the first time and Keith Duffy will probably have paid dearly for remarks about his wife's sexual preferences. Although viewers saw the most dramatic moments in the house, there are hundreds of hours of tapes on computer file at Bazal Productions. Just like Big Brother the contestants were under constant surveillance from the cameras. Mr Bazalgette said the company had not been put under any pressure by the celebrities to erase the tapes. In an interview with MediaGuardian, Mr Bazalgette has also dismissed the conspiracy theories surrounding the show which gripped the nation for eight days. He denied the contestants had mobile phones, were fed gourmet food and fine wines when the cameras weren't switched on, and declared that Chris Eubank was wrong to suggest the voting had been rigged. He also revealed that counselling was offered to at least one of the contestants.

      "body": "<p>Three great myths have shaped public services. The first is the post-war welfare state, the promise of state-owned, state-run services. The second is privatisation, the idea that monopoly public services should be subject to market forces. The third is what we have now: the managerial state, delivering productivity gains through targets and beefed-up management.</p> <p>Each myth has reached its natural limit. The model of the large, paternalistic state organisation no longer fits. Privatisation was supposed to be the answer, but people rightly remain suspicious of privatisation reaching into the heart of public services. The profit motive is strong at filling shop shelves but poor at delivering public goods: objectives like safety, dignity and wellbeing don't mesh well with financial incentives. The result is either poor performance or the government finds itself drawn into constant, expensive monitoring and intervention. The managerial state uses service agreements, targets and league tables so that funding can follow performance. But the tyranny of numbers, the way historically all large hierarchies attempt to control, ends up stifling creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>There is another way, which aims to achieve the kind of entrepreneurialism encouraged by privatisation but within the context of social ownership. I call this the mutualisation of public services. It means that ownership and accountability passes from Whitehall to the direct stakeholders of public services - those who work in them and those who benefit from them. There are two ways to do this. The first is to convert public services into non-profit enterprises.</p> <p>Greenwich Leisure is a good example; it was set up by councillors at the London Borough of Greenwich when cuts hit in 1992. It is a cooperative in which 80% of employees have opted for an ownership stake. With a workforce of about 1,000, they have increased the number of leisure facilities in Greenwich and have trebled income in the last six years to more than \u00a39m, while more than halving the cost to the local authority for the service. Greenwich Leisure has assisted the replication of the model in 13 other local authority areas from Bristol to Teesside.</p> <p>The second approach is simply to get the public back into public services. This is a theme that Gordon Brown is warming up to. An example is Kingsdale school, in south London, where children are engaged in redesigning the school as it goes through a \u00a39m new building works project. Workshops were held with children and staff and they were able to say what they wanted from a school building. Locker space was a concern for the children - it was their space, their stake in the school. Architects heard that corridors in the school are narrow, and become places of conflict.

      "bodyText": "Three great myths have shaped public services. The first is the post-war welfare state, the promise of state-owned, state-run services. The second is privatisation, the idea that monopoly public services should be subject to market forces. The third is what we have now: the managerial state, delivering productivity gains through targets and beefed-up management. Each myth has reached its natural limit. The model of the large, paternalistic state organisation no longer fits. Privatisation was supposed to be the answer, but people rightly remain suspicious of privatisation reaching into the heart of public services. The profit motive is strong at filling shop shelves but poor at delivering public goods: objectives like safety, dignity and wellbeing don't mesh well with financial incentives. The result is either poor performance or the government finds itself drawn into constant, expensive monitoring and intervention. The managerial state uses service agreements, targets and league tables so that funding can follow performance. But the tyranny of numbers, the way historically all large hierarchies attempt to control, ends up stifling creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship. There is another way, which aims to achieve the kind of entrepreneurialism encouraged by privatisation but within the context of social ownership. I call this the mutualisation of public services. It means that ownership and accountability passes from Whitehall to the direct stakeholders of public services - those who work in them and those who benefit from them. There are two ways to do this. The first is to convert public services into non-profit enterprises. Greenwich Leisure is a good example; it was set up by councillors at the London Borough of Greenwich when cuts hit in 1992. It is a cooperative in which 80% of employees have opted for an ownership stake. With a workforce of about 1,000, they have increased the number of leisure facilities in Greenwich and have trebled income in the last six years to more than \u00a39m, while more than halving the cost to the local authority for the service. Greenwich Leisure has assisted the replication of the model in 13 other local authority areas from Bristol to Teesside. The second approach is simply to get the public back into public services. This is a theme that Gordon Brown is warming up to. An example is Kingsdale school, in south London, where children are engaged in redesigning the school as it goes through a \u00a39m new building works project. Workshops were held with children and staff and they were able to say what they wanted from a school building. Locker space was a concern for the children - it was their space, their stake in the school. Architects heard that corridors in the school are narrow, and become places of conflict. As children poured out from lessons, bottlenecks were a place for disruption and even fights. Design solutions that tackled these issues would improve wellbeing at the school. It has not all been easy, as those with power have to decide whether they can let go. But children and teachers are not just contributing to initial design in the school works project, they will also do the evaluation. For a school once on special measures, this will be a true test of progress. Health, education, care, employment advice, parks and local authority services all offer similar seeds of a participatory civic renewal of public services. But just as there are signs of hope, in other areas mistakes are being made. Simply breaking up the leviathan institutions of the state is not enough. What is happening in housing shows this up most starkly; 200,000 homes are transferring every year from local authority control to registered social landlords and new social housing companies with little accountability to residents.

When the great institutions of the welfare state swept in, non-profit organisations which had pioneered much of the work were seen as yesterday's solution.

Two weeks into the five-week trial the first results reveal users are responding to between 10% and 28% of adverts, well above response rates for direct marketing. The trial among 1,000 16 to 34-year-olds is being carried out by wireless marketing company the Mobile Channel, which will launch the initiative to the public in July. The service sends participants three messages a day from advertisers whose products and services match the personal profile of the consumer. In return the consumer gets 5p per message and can choose to receive the reward in mobile phone airtime, WH Smith vouchers or to donate it to charity. A year of messages adds up to \u00a350. NOP surveyed 138 of the trialists to gather initial results. It found that 80% look at the messages as soon as they are received; 72% read between 76% - 100% of the messages in full; and 77% agree the adverts are interesting. The charity donations service will be launched in July. Amnesty and Childline have already signed up. In October the service giving airtime and WH Smith vouchers will go live. A \u00a35m above-the-line advertising campaign will kick off in October and the service hopes to have half a million consumers signed up by the end of the year. The company is seeking an advertising agency to handle the account and is working with an unnamed branding consultancy on the creation of the brand name and image for the service. MediaCom TMB is likely to handle the media buying for the account as it is involved in the trial. The Mobile Channel was formed in June 2000 by former Cable &amp; Wireless executive Chris Havemann and ex-PriceWaterhouseCoopers marketing strategist Andrew Cooper.

      "bodyText": "The Netherlands was last night struggling to come to terms with the bad news its farmers have feared for so long - the outbreak of foot and mouth disease on Dutch soil. In the small town of Olst in the east of the country, where four cows on a tiny family farm were found to be contaminated by the disease, the local community was in shock last night but not blaming anyone yet for an incident which could go on to ravage the surrounding area and decimate the local economy. The entire windswept dyke-pocked region is saturated with similar farms and the fear is that the disease will be carried by the wind which wa last night rattling across the flat snow-covered fields around the infected farm. The fact that another holding in the neighbouring village of Oene is in the grip of the disease together with a farm in nearby Oosterwolde has stoked fears that the disease could spread across the whole country, which is heavily dependent upon agriculture. A police roadblock was last night thrown up around the Olst holding together with a 3km exclusion zone. All that could be seen of the infected farm yesterday evening was a faint orange light glowing in freezing fog across a flooded field. Curious locals gathered at the farm's entrance together with the Dutch and international media waiting for a sight that has now become all too familiar in the UK - a flatbed truck to cart away slaughtered animals to be incinerated. \"The local people are disappointed and shocked. We suspected this might happen but we prayed that it would not,\" said police spokesman William Rabelink. \"We don't know where it came from yet but I suppose if the locals really knew that it came from England they would be angry.\" As the evening wore on news filtered out that all of the animals on the Olst farm were being slaughtered and a blanket ban on animal transport in the area was swiftly enforced. The infected holding sits cheek by jowl with at least six other farms, and government vets moved in last night to begin taking blood tests to see if they too were infected. \"This is a huge problem for Olst and the entire country,\" said Michel Groothaar, a local factory worker, who had come out to film the commotion with his camcorder. \"We were warned that this might happen last week but we're still incredibly shocked. But the government is doing everything right.\" European Union vets last night imposed an immediate ban on livestock exports from the Netherlands as Dutch authorities signalled they would break with the agreed policy and begin vaccinating some animals.

      "body": "<p>Emergency measures to deal with the ethnic Albanian insurrection in Macedonia announced yesterday by Nato ambassadors in Brussels are unlikely to dispel concern that the alliance is not doing enough to prevent what is, potentially at least, another Balkan conflagration.</p> <p>Nato has been criticised by the Macedonian government and by Serbia's President Vojislav Kostunica for failing to react quickly and decisively after the insurgency spread westwards from Serbia's Presevo valley, on Kosovo's border, towards Tetovo in Macedonia over the past two weeks.</p> <p>The Russians have also been noisily making their feelings known. The foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, accused Nato of presiding over a \"hotbed of extremism\" in Kosovo during a visit to Skopje, the Macedonian capital, this week.</p> <p>Like Kostunica, Ivanov is keen to make the political point that Nato's 1999 Kosovo intervention has simply destabilised the region.</p> <p>More disturbingly for Nato, much criticism has come from its own side, with the alliance's leading member, the US, coming under particular attack. The 5,000-strong US contingent of K-For in south-eastern Kosovo is accused in particular of failing to curb the growth of Albanian gunmen crossing the border into Macedonia for fear of taking risks.</p> <p>In response to this furore, Nato announced yesterday that yet more K-For troops would be redeployed to the Kosovo border and that cooperation and military coordination with the Skopje government would be increased.</p> <p>It was also disclosed that the US is providing the Macedonians with aerial photos, military intelligence and unidentified \"military hardware\", and that Britain had decided to send an eight-man military liaison team to Skopje.</p> <p>But that is as far as it goes. George Robertson, the Nato secretary general, Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, and Geoffrey Hoon, the British defence secretary, have all repeatedly stressed that no Nato troops will be sent to assist the Macedonians.</p> <p>In other words, there will be no direct intervention, as in Kosovo, even though the Macedonian government appears both to want and need outside help and is a member of Nato's Partnership for Peace programme.</p> <p>This policy has led many to ask whether Nato is making the same mistake as elsewhere in the Balkans, when the West failed to prevent large-scale loss of life and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Croatia in the 1990s.</p> <p>This time, it is argued, there is even less excuse since Nato already has 42,000 troops on the ground. It is not that the means are lacking. What is absent is the will.</p> <p>The reasons why Nato refuses to get more deeply involved are several - and they go to the heart of Western peacekeeping problems in the Balkans.</p> <p>One relatively simple argument is that a military commitment in Macedonia could undermine K-For's capabilities in Kosovo, where trouble regularly occurs in Serb enclaves like Mitrovica in the north and in the Presevo buffer zone.</p> <p>A Nato decision to join the fight with the ethnic Albanians inside Macedonia would be likely to infuriate the predominantly Albanian population of Kosovo, which could then turn on Nato and UN personnel.</p> <p>It is also pointed out that K-For has no mandate from the UN for operations in Macedonia.</p> <p>These reasons for keeping out, while practical in nature, are hardly conclusive, however. Newly democratised Serbia is no longer the threatening enemy it was when Slobodan Milosevic was still president.</p> <p>Serb forces are now working alongside K-For in the Presevo valley. In Kosovo itself, most ethnic Albanians do not support the extremists, as last year's local elections showed. An \"uprising\" against Nato does not seem likely. Meanwhile, a UN mandate in Macedonia could easily be obtained, given the almost universal opposition to the Albanian insurgency.</p> <p>Is there a moral objection, then, to Nato intervention?</p> <p>The ethnic Albanians who comprise the self-styled National Liberation Army (NLA) in Macedonia state that they are fighting for equal rights with the Slavic majority which, they say, discriminates and oppresses them. Through this argument, they appear to hope that they can win Western sympathy, as did the Kosovars in 1999.</p> <p>However, nobody in the West seriously argues that the disadvantages faced by minority ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, although not insignificant, can be compared with the excesses visited upon their kith and kin by Milosevic's thugs in Kosovo.</p> <p>On the contrary, Macedonia has long been held up as a model of inter-communal cooperation. In reality, it is argued, the relatively few insurgents are trying to gain by the gun what should properly be obtained through negotiation and the ballot box.</p> <p>In such circumstances, there is no moral objection to intervention. In fact, the opposite holds true. Nato would be politically and morally justified in going to the support of Macedonia's democratic majority, comprising as it does both ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. But still it does not do so.</p> <p>A more murky explanation for Nato's reluctance is to be found in reports that Western countries, principally the US and Britain, aided, trained and armed the very gunmen who are now fighting in the Tetovo hills.</p> <p>This assistance, reportedly funded by the CIA, was given prior to the Kosovo intervention. To move against these people now, it is claimed, would be to admit both that the West had created a \"monster\" that it could not now control (the Serbs and Russians would love that), and that it has definitively failed to establish a law-abiding civil society in Kosovo.</p> <p>All these explanations may have elements of truth. But, in trying to explain Nato policy, they ignore the fundamental political and military flaw within the alliance itself.</p> <p>The bottom line is that Nato is not an association of equal partners. It is a US security organisation to which others belong. Nato does not do anything, or go anywhere, without an okay from Washington, especially not into a war zone in the Balkans. And what Washington wants is decided by the administration in charge.</p> <p>Looked at from this perspective, and given the recent changeover at the White House, it is easy to see why direct intervention in Macedonia is out of the question at the moment.</p> <p>President George Bush was elected partly on a pledge to pull US troops out of the Balkans, not get more deeply involved. Bush is also committed to reviewing, with a view to running down, US commitments to peacekeeping operations round the world.</p> <p>The US has already begun a rundown of its troops in Bosnia. Washington has long been terrified at the prospect of getting sucked into what it calls the \"Balkan quagmire\". Intervention in Macedonia is seen exactly in that light.</p> <p>Intervention could involve US casualties. This evokes the \"body bag syndrome\". In other words, the political cost of losing soldiers overseas in \"other people's wars\" is deemed unacceptable.</p> <p>There is no \"exit strategy\" - secretary of state Colin Powell's famous dictum. A commitment to Macedonia would necessarily be open-ended.</p> <p>More broadly, nobody in the West seems to be able to agree what should be done about Kosovo in the long term. Should it become independent or be returned to Serbia? The prospect of Macedonia also becoming a virtual Nato protectorate, and perhaps Montenegro, too, is a very unwelcome one to Washington</p> <p>For all these reasons, Bush and his advisers oppose the sort of direct intervention in Macedonia that could snuff out the insurrection before it spreads and becomes a full-scale civil war.</p> <p>Knowing that full well, America's European allies cannot, and will not, act. The US may be right, of course. The measures being taken now could work and the crisis may be defused. But it is a gamble. Furthermore, in highlighting these paralysing constraints on Nato's collective ability to act, the Macedonian crisis has also fuelled the argument in favour of developing a separate EU-led European \"army\" and, perhaps, one day, abolishing Nato altogether.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,450658,00.html\">The fighting in Macedonia explained</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee8064c/0\">Should Nato intervene?</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia\">Macedonia</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/macedonia/story/0,7369,461030,00.html\">22.03.2001: Macedonia rejects rebel ceasefire offer</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461031,00.html\">22.03.2001: Britain and US help drive against Albanians</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,461050,00.html\">22.03.2001: Fear and suspicion seep in the capital</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,460636,00.html\">21.03.2001: Army threatening all-out attack</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,460468,00.html\">21.03.2001: Albanian rebels told to flee or die</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,460479,00.html\">21.03.2001: Nato plea for more troops in Balkans ignored</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,460463,00.html\">21.03.2001: 'We don't seek killings and war \u00c9 '</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,7369,460472,00.html\">21.03.2001: All set for a battle nobody wants</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.gov.mk/english\" target=\"_NEW\">Macedonian government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.morm.gov.mk/granica/nastanie.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Macedonian defence ministry - updates on border clashes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.al\" target=\"_NEW\">Albanian foreign ministry</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4821\" target=\"_NEW\">Foreign secretary Robin Cook's statement on Macedonia</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.kforonline.com/news/updates.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">K-For news updates</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Two weeks after Napster began blocking copyrighted songs from being traded on its network, an online tracking firm has shown that its users are downloading 60% fewer files. According to the internet research firm Webnoize, the average number of files shared per Napster users was 172 before a court ruled the firm must block copyright infringing traffic earlier this month. After the judgment and the introduction of efforts to block illegal usage, the average number of files shared per user fell to 71. </p> <p>\"Napster is successfully filtering many songs from its system,\" said analyst Matt Bailey of Webnoize. \"It is not just the number of files available that has fallen sharply. The number of downloads per user has dropped by half.\" </p> <p>Although Napster officials disagree with the recording industry about the burdens the company must bear in policing its system for unauthorised content, the company has continued to strengthen its screening technology. </p> <p>Last week, Napster enlisted the help of Gracenote Inc, a maker of music recognition services, to help boost file-filtering efforts. Grace note, an online music catalogue company, operates a database containing 9m song titles plus 3m misspellings and 140,000 variations on 250,000 artist names that Napster users have adopted to get round the ban. The group 'N Sync, for instance, is listed in more than 50 ways. </p> <p>In an effort to comply with the court ruling, Napster also requested that Aimster, a company that helps users share music via AOL's Instant Messenger software and is a potential alternative to the service, stop offering a program called Pig Encoder. This changes each word in the file by taking the first letter of each word and placing it at the end of the word. </p> <p>Aimster CEO Johnny Deep said he had agreed to stop offering the system. \"Napster actually asked us to take it down,\" he said. </p> <p>However, there is still plenty of music on Napster identified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as under copyright. The company says many of the 135,000 submissions of copyright works from the recording industry have no associated file names for the company to block and it is failing to share the workload and provide required information. </p> <p>Napster, which only a few months ago claimed it could not control which tunes got traded on its site, says it's doing all it can to stop illegal file-swapping. \"Where a file name is connected to the work in the notice, Napster will exclude them. Where no file name is connected to the work, Napster will not,\" the company says. </p> <p>But the recording industry claims the service is still not doing enough and has accused the firm of stalling. \"Stall tactics are unacceptable,\" warned Amy Weiss of the RIAA. Howard King, an attorney for arch Napster foe Metallica, was blunter: \"They're not trying hard enough.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, new lawsuits are landing on Napster almost every day. The online music retailer EMusic.com, which pays license fees to independent artists and sells their music online, filed a copyright infringement suit against the company accusing it of lying when it insisted late last year that it could not remove EMusic's material from the Napster service. Last week, the producer of the Grammys award show filed suit aiming to stop fans from sharing copies of live performances. </p> <p>But as Napster attempts to comply, and the recording industry senses it is now getting the upper hand, the debate is set to shift to how the enforcers should adapt to the medium of online distribution. If the recording industry fails to come up with a workable alternative, internet music pirates will just find alternatives to Napster. </p> <p>\"The music industry can't beat Napster simply by suing it, because Napster imitators will spring up, and suing all of them is costly,\" says technology writer Sebastian Mallaby. \"The industry therefore has to make its tunes conveniently available at legal online sites, so that fans have less reason to frequent pirate ones.\" </p> <p>Napster may have been tamed, but the issue is far from settled. Webnoize analyst Matt Bailey says that there is already anecdotal evidence that Napster users are switching to services such as Aimster, Music City and Gnutella and predicts that Napster users will flee to rival systems as more songs are blocked. </p> <p>\"There are some pretty good alternative systems around,\" he says. \"The sort of loyalty that we are seeing among Napster users is going to be very temporary.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two weeks after Napster began blocking copyrighted songs from being traded on its network, an online tracking firm has shown that its users are downloading 60% fewer files. According to the internet research firm Webnoize, the average number of files shared per Napster users was 172 before a court ruled the firm must block copyright infringing traffic earlier this month. After the judgment and the introduction of efforts to block illegal usage, the average number of files shared per user fell to 71. \"Napster is successfully filtering many songs from its system,\" said analyst Matt Bailey of Webnoize. \"It is not just the number of files available that has fallen sharply. The number of downloads per user has dropped by half.\" Although Napster officials disagree with the recording industry about the burdens the company must bear in policing its system for unauthorised content, the company has continued to strengthen its screening technology. Last week, Napster enlisted the help of Gracenote Inc, a maker of music recognition services, to help boost file-filtering efforts. Grace note, an online music catalogue company, operates a database containing 9m song titles plus 3m misspellings and 140,000 variations on 250,000 artist names that Napster users have adopted to get round the ban. The group 'N Sync, for instance, is listed in more than 50 ways. In an effort to comply with the court ruling, Napster also requested that Aimster, a company that helps users share music via AOL's Instant Messenger software and is a potential alternative to the service, stop offering a program called Pig Encoder. This changes each word in the file by taking the first letter of each word and placing it at the end of the word. Aimster CEO Johnny Deep said he had agreed to stop offering the system. \"Napster actually asked us to take it down,\" he said. However, there is still plenty of music on Napster identified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as under copyright. The company says many of the 135,000 submissions of copyright works from the recording industry have no associated file names for the company to block and it is failing to share the workload and provide required information. Napster, which only a few months ago claimed it could not control which tunes got traded on its site, says it's doing all it can to stop illegal file-swapping. \"Where a file name is connected to the work in the notice, Napster will exclude them. Where no file name is connected to the work, Napster will not,\" the company says. But the recording industry claims the service is still not doing enough and has accused the firm of stalling. \"Stall tactics are unacceptable,\" warned Amy Weiss of the RIAA. Howard King, an attorney for arch Napster foe Metallica, was blunter: \"They're not trying hard enough.\" Meanwhile, new lawsuits are landing on Napster almost every day. The online music retailer EMusic.com, which pays license fees to independent artists and sells their music online, filed a copyright infringement suit against the company accusing it of lying when it insisted late last year that it could not remove EMusic's material from the Napster service. Last week, the producer of the Grammys award show filed suit aiming to stop fans from sharing copies of live performances. But as Napster attempts to comply, and the recording industry senses it is now getting the upper hand, the debate is set to shift to how the enforcers should adapt to the medium of online distribution. If the recording industry fails to come up with a workable alternative, internet music pirates will just find alternatives to Napster. \"The music industry can't beat Napster simply by suing it, because Napster imitators will spring up, and suing all of them is costly,\" says technology writer Sebastian Mallaby. \"The industry therefore has to make its tunes conveniently available at legal online sites, so that fans have less reason to frequent pirate ones.\" Napster may have been tamed, but the issue is far from settled. Webnoize analyst Matt Bailey says that there is already anecdotal evidence that Napster users are switching to services such as Aimster, Music City and Gnutella and predicts that Napster users will flee to rival systems as more songs are blocked. \"There are some pretty good alternative systems around,\" he says. \"The sort of loyalty that we are seeing among Napster users is going to be very temporary.\"",

      "body": "<p>Having hired a Swede to manage the England football team, we could do worse than hire some more to run the country. Sweden is, after all, the world's number one information economy, says a report produced by the International Data Corporation (IDC) and <a href=\"http://www.worldpaper.com\">World Times</a>. Last year, Sweden took over the top spot from the US, and this year it continued to skate ahead while the Americans tumbled to fourth behind Norway and Finland. </p> <p>This is good going for a country of only 9m people: Sweden's population is roughly the same as Greater London, but spread out over an area slightly larger than California. </p> <p>Like its Scandinavian neighbours, Sweden scores highly in the Information Society Index (ISI) because of the number of telephone lines and mobile phones in use. Indeed, it is the mobile phone boom that has just rocketed the UK into sixth place, up from 12th last year. But Sweden has the best internet infrastructure as well, beating Singapore and Australia. It also gets good scores in the other two categories: computing infrastructure, where the US comes top, and \"social infrastructure\" (civil liberties, press freedom, school enrolments etc), which is headed by Norway. </p> <p>The Swedes are somewhat surprised by their new pre-eminence. A walk around Stockholm does not suggest that the population has been gripped by internet fever the way that Seoul, in South Korea, and San Francisco have been over the past few years. Not many shops have their website addresses painted on their windows. There don't seem to be any basement games parlours packed with kids playing Quake III and other games on networks of PCs, as there are in Asia. Nor did I spot a single cybercafe. There are several, but Starbucks-style coffee shops are far more common. So are McDonald's. </p> <p>Henrik Eklund, chief executive of Pan Interactive, a multimedia publishing company based in Stockholm, says Swedes have been quick to adopt information technology because it is a middle-class country with high educational standards. Also, he grins, \"we're the most Americanised country in the world, after England\". </p> <p>Children learn English as a second language, and they are helped by the fact that English-language movies are not dubbed but subtitled when they are shown on Swedish television. They are not prevented from using PCs or surfing the web by an inability to handle the language, or lack of familiarity with American culture. </p> <p>\"Then there's the climate: never forget that!\" Pan's office in Stockholm has polished wooden floors and comfortable armchairs, but Eklund does not need to remind me that it is freezing outside. A neon thermometer on the side of a building shows as many degrees below zero as it does above, and the current reading is 0C. It isn't too cold to go out, but you'd be more likely to stay home and chat to friends on the net than get together in some pavement cafe. </p> <p>And if you stay home in Sweden, you probably have access to at least one PC. Magnus Jandel, chief technology officer of Terraplay Systems, explains. \"In 1998, there was a government initiative that enabled you to buy a PC from your employer with pre-tax money - and with the level of tax in Sweden, that gives you the PC at about half price,\" he says. </p> <p>The scheme's impact was enormous, because at the time, most people wanted a PC. People who would not have been interested five or 10 or 20 years earlier suddenly wanted PCs to get on to the internet. </p> <p>\"There is something to be said for that kind of support,\" adds Jandel. \"When I was growing up, the government had a scheme that made it very easy to buy musical instruments, and 15 to 20 years after that, Sweden's music exports are just booming.\" </p> <p>The government is also promoting research and development. Sweden, like everywhere else, has its own Silicon Valley, the <a href=\"http://www.kistasciencepark.org\">Kista Science Park</a>. Mats Andersson, from Ericsson, the biggest manufacturer of equipment for telecoms operators, says Kista is the second most important IT centre in the world \"after Silicon Valley, of course\". The IT University, which Andersson describes as Sweden's MIT, opened there in 1999. \"It will be the biggest IT university in Europe by 2004,\" he claims. </p> <p>Even Microsoft is getting in on the act. Annemarie Duffy, the marketing manager for Microsoft's wireless and mobility division in the UK, says Microsoft now has more than 300 people in Sweden. In 1999, Microsoft bought a Swedish mobile communications company called Sendit, and this forms the basis of its research and development organisation in Kista. It is a concrete acknowledgment of the fact that the area is \"a centre of excellence\" in mobile communications. </p> <p>Microsoft has also formed a joint venture with the 125-year-old Ericsson to sell its server software to the telecoms operators who are Ericsson's main customers: British Telecom, France Telecom, Telefonica, Telia and so on. The company's name is surprisingly dull - Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture AB - but the young president, Ulf Avrin, is enthusiastic. \"It is a dream team,\" he says, \"not just two ordinary companies teaming up, but two global leaders.\" </p> <p>The problem with Kista, and Stockholm's communications scene in general, is that you can hardly cross the street without bumping into someone who works for Ericsson, or used to work for Ericsson, or works for one of Ericsson's suppliers. It is a big fish in a small pond, with more than 10,000 employees in Kista alone. Worldwide it employs more than 100,000 people in 140 countries, and its sales have grown from 99bn Swedish Kronor (\u00a36.8bn) in 1995 to SEK274bn (\u00a318.8bn) in 2000. It is not the only big company in Sweden - others include Electrolux, Volvo, Skandia and Ikea - but it is one of the most powerful. </p> <p>One of the alternatives to working for Ericsson is to work for one of its offshoots. Both Avrin and Jandel come into that category. In fact, I got into the habit of asking people if they knew Joran Hoff. \"Oh yes,\" said Jandel, \"he used to be my boss.\" </p> <p>Hoff has \"the best job in Ericsson\": he is president and chief executive of EBI (Ericsson Business Innovation), which started three years ago as a business unit. It operates as a venture capitalist and incubator for new companies and new ideas. </p> <p>\"We want to create the future of Ericsson,\" says Hoff. \"We want to find the next core businesses, so we have to be free thinking and free acting. We have to work on things even if they look different from corporate strategy. We take on impossible tasks, that's what we do.\" Currently that means 20-25 ventures in things such as mobile telecoms, security and connecting up homes. Hoff seems particularly keen on promoting Ericsson's OSGI as an open systems gateway interface for home automation, where it is working with Electrolux. </p> <p>Hoff would not pass as a rebel in a big American company - he manages not to wear a tie, but he still has the white shirt and nice suit, so maybe he stuffed it in his pocket. However, in Ericsson's gentlemanly halls, it is enough to signal that he is not obliged to toe the corporate line. </p> <p>Of course, as Paradox Entertainment's Gustaf Magnusson says: \"Not everyone wants to work for Ericsson.\" Well, you can start up on your own, but it is not easy. Paradox's president, Nils Gulliksson, explains: \"We don't really have a home market to fund big movies or big projects.\" You have think about the export market before you even start. </p> <p>One solution is to specialise, like Swe Dish, which was co-founded by Per Wahlberg and Markus Selin in 1994. They sell Fly Away and Drive Away systems for satellite communications, and Wahlberg says they are the smallest you can get. Swe Dish has a global market in its niche, so if you see television journalists reporting live from a Balkan war zone or a Himalayan mountain, they may well be using a 90cm Swe Dish to upload the pictures to a satellite. Customers include BT, CNN and the BBC. </p> <p>Paradox did, in fact, start with a local market: it had a big hit with its Svea Rike series of simulation games based on Sweden's history, \"but it was totally impossible to export it,\" says Gulliksson. The company has since expanded its range with a war game, Europa Universalis, which is available in the Scandinavian languages plus English, German and Chinese. But Paradox is pinning its long-term hopes on multiplayer games such as Mutant Chronicles: Warzone Online, which will be played over the internet. </p> <p>\"We don't think we're a Swedish company, we're an internet company,\" says Magnusson, thinking ahead. \"If you're on the internet, you're already a global company.\" </p> <p>At Pan Interactive, Eklund is also developing locally but thinking globally. Pan has developed a \"horse and pony\" series for girls aged 12-17. The idea is to launch new stories as books, as video games and on the web (at <a href=\"http://www.rosemondvalley.com\">www.rosemondvalley.com</a>) at the same time. At the moment the episodes are aimed at the Swedish market, but the fictional settings are not Swedish: Eklund describes them as New Englandish, which is where they will one day need to sell. </p> <p>\"You can test your product in the Nordics,\" he says. \"It's not enough to support the investment, but you can test it here.\" </p> <p>But not everything is rosy, even in Rosemond Valley. The sudden downturn in America's fortunes is having repercussions everywhere, and Ericsson's major customers have problems of their own. British Telecom's debt burden is just one example. </p> <p>Last week, Ericsson announced a profits warning because of \"delayed investments by operators in the US and western Europe and [the] continued poor business trend for mobile telephones\". Although Ericsson sold 43.3m phones last year - about 20% of its business - the consumer products division lost SEK16bn (\u00a31.1bn) including restructuring charges, as an oversupply of mobiles led to lower prices. As a result, it is now getting outside suppliers to manufacture its handsets. </p> <p>David King, vice president of Ericsson's multi-service networks division, remains optimistic. He says the telecoms business \"is a safe bet, in a way: people are never going to want to communicate less\". King sells a system called Engine, a name derived from NGN or Next Generation Networks. The clever idea is to replace what may be three separate networks for landline, mobile and internet communications with a single multi-service network. But even if all the telcos want to buy it, will they be able to afford it? </p> <p>The boom in mobile phone and mobile internet use, and the need to build new networks to handle next generation telephone services, should provide Ericsson with a secure and profitable future. But if the telcos stumble, it won't just be the Swedish winters that are chilly. </p> <p><strong> Information society index</strong><br> These are the top 15 SKATERS (countries with an ISI score above 3,500), all of which are in a strong position in the information revolution because of advanced information, computer, internet and social infrastructure </p> <p><strong> Rank Country Score</strong> <br> 1 Sweden 6,496 2 </p> <p> Norway 6,112 </p> <p> 3 Finland 5,953 </p> <p> 4 US 5,850 </p> <p> 5 Denmark 5,837 </p> <p> 6 UK 5,662 </p> <p> 7 Switzerland 5,528 </p> <p> 8 Australia 5,382 </p> <p> 9 Singapore 5,269 </p> <p> 10 Netherlands 5,238 </p> <p> 11 Japan 5,182 </p> <p> 12 Canada 5,126 </p> <p> 13 Germany 4,937 </p> <p> 14 Austria 4,868 </p> <p> 15 Hong Kong 4,745</p>",

      "body": "<p>We are camped beneath thorn trees on the bank of a river called the Topernawi that drains into the western shore of Lake Turkana in northern Kenya - if \"drains\" can be applied to a river of sand. The dryness, however, is not total, for a metre beneath the surface lies water clean enough to drink without purification. One hot afternoon in July 1998, Gabriel Ekalale and I leave camp and head a hundred metres east along the river, out into the main stream, to a waterhole that others in the camp had dug earlier. Gabriel clambers down the hole and stands on a stone, careful not to tip sand into the foot-square stamp of clear water at the bottom. He fills jerries and buckets and, passing them to me standing above, I decant these into larger drums and vessels. </p> <p>The sun reflected off the sand is fiercely hot and it seems to take ages to fill the drums, but fill them we must, and do. Later on, others from the camp will lift the filled drums on to a Land Rover and bring them into camp. Collecting water in Africa takes time, ingenuity and effort, and everyone takes their turn. At home, you would just turn on a tap and think nothing of it. </p> <p>When not doing the chores, Gabriel and the others in the field camp run by Dr Meave Leakey, of the National Museums of Kenya, are out on the exposures, poring over the jumbled rocks for the remains of animals alive 3.5m years ago, when these sediments were laid down. Some of these animals are our close relatives, extinct creatures whose forms bear on human ancestry; 1998 was a good year for Gabriel - his sharp eyes picked up several teeth in the badlands between the Topernawi and another sand river, the Lomekwi. Many of his colleagues had similar luck, but most found isolated teeth. All I could manage was a badly crushed skull of what turned out to have been a pig. </p> <p>In August 1999, however, one of the team found a complete cranium of a human-like creature that might once have dug for water, as we did, but never returned to camp. This skull is the oldest reasonably complete cranium of any member of the human family yet discovered anywhere in the world, and Leakey and colleagues describe it and its implications in today's Nature. </p> <p>What strikes you first about the fossil is how remarkably human the face looks - hafted onto a primitive, small brain case. The implications of this curious mix of features dawns on you more slowly. This single fossil destroys current pictures of human ancestry with the casual abandon of an Exocet colliding with an egg. </p> <p>The human lineage split from that of the African apes 5-10m years ago. The earliest securely known member of this lineage (which does not, of course, imply direct ancestry) is Ardipithecus ramidus, from Ethiopia. The only known species from the period around 3.5m years ago is Australopithecus afarensis - popularly known as \"Lucy\" - and the human lineage is only thought to have diversified into a wide range of forms around 2.5m years ago. </p> <p>This new creature destroys this picture completely. It is not very much like australopithecus, or anything else, and suggests that the ancient humans diversified much earlier than had been suspected, and the diversity itself was greater. To acknowledge this diversity, the researchers have done what many will see as an extreme step, and have placed the new fossil in its very own genus. It is called Kenyanthropus platyops: the flat-faced man of Kenya. </p> <p>The \"platyops\" epithet says it all. The face lacks the protruding mid-face and jaws of its contemporary, australopithecus. Indeed, for something so antique, it looks remarkably human. This is not to say that kenyanthropus would have been any more human in its behaviour than australopithecus - still less does it mean that the lineage that leads to humans, specifically, can definitively be traced back 3.5m years. </p> <p>What it does mean, however, is that \"human\" faces evolved long ago, and in creatures much less human than we, parochially, would think deserved them. The flat face adds to the list of features once thought distinctively human, that are found in the non-human fossil record. Australopithecus, for example, probably walked as upright as you or I, and kenyanthropus probably did so, too. </p> <p>But there is one fossil of which kenyanthropus is inescapably reminiscent. In the 1970s, Bernard Ngeneo, a member of Richard Leakey's field crew working the fossil beds on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana, found a skull known from its catalogue number - KNM-ER 1470. This skull, \"1470 man\" for short, looks very modern, and is generally assigned to Homo rudolfensis, a very early member of our own genus. Kenyanthropus has a very similar, flattened face, but is almost twice as ancient as 1470. </p> <p>Another reason why it would be unwise to see modern human lineaments in the disconcerting face of kenyanthropus lies, interestingly, with 1470. Recent reappraisals by Bernard Wood, of George Washington University in Washington DC, and colleagues suggests that homo rudolfensis and its close relative, Homo habilis, should be ejected from homo - bound, as it were, in adamantine chains and hurled headlong from the ethereal sky, as some poet or other mentioned in another context. The reason for this banishment is that these early examples of homo are really no closer to modern humans than, say, australopithecus - or, as it happens, kenyanthropus. </p> <p>Where does kenyanthropus fit into the great scheme of human evolution? The answer, at present, is that nobody knows, and Leakey and colleagues decline to speculate. At the moment, kenyanthropus adds an exclamation mark to what has been, for some time, the confused state of our understanding of human evolution. It points the way to discoveries of diverse ancients as yet hidden. The next few years promise to be ripe for discovery, if not for understanding. </p> <p>\u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.

This single fossil destroys current pictures of human ancestry with the casual abandon of an Exocet colliding with an egg. The human lineage split from that of the African apes 5-10m years ago. The earliest securely known member of this lineage (which does not, of course, imply direct ancestry) is Ardipithecus ramidus, from Ethiopia. The only known species from the period around 3.5m years ago is Australopithecus afarensis - popularly known as \"Lucy\" - and the human lineage is only thought to have diversified into a wide range of forms around 2.5m years ago. This new creature destroys this picture completely. It is not very much like australopithecus, or anything else, and suggests that the ancient humans diversified much earlier than had been suspected, and the diversity itself was greater. To acknowledge this diversity, the researchers have done what many will see as an extreme step, and have placed the new fossil in its very own genus. It is called Kenyanthropus platyops: the flat-faced man of Kenya. The \"platyops\" epithet says it all. The face lacks the protruding mid-face and jaws of its contemporary, australopithecus. Indeed, for something so antique, it looks remarkably human. This is not to say that kenyanthropus would have been any more human in its behaviour than australopithecus - still less does it mean that the lineage that leads to humans, specifically, can definitively be traced back 3.5m years. What it does mean, however, is that \"human\" faces evolved long ago, and in creatures much less human than we, parochially, would think deserved them. The flat face adds to the list of features once thought distinctively human, that are found in the non-human fossil record. Australopithecus, for example, probably walked as upright as you or I, and kenyanthropus probably did so, too. But there is one fossil of which kenyanthropus is inescapably reminiscent. In the 1970s, Bernard Ngeneo, a member of Richard Leakey's field crew working the fossil beds on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana, found a skull known from its catalogue number - KNM-ER 1470. This skull, \"1470 man\" for short, looks very modern, and is generally assigned to Homo rudolfensis, a very early member of our own genus. Kenyanthropus has a very similar, flattened face, but is almost twice as ancient as 1470. Another reason why it would be unwise to see modern human lineaments in the disconcerting face of kenyanthropus lies, interestingly, with 1470. Recent reappraisals by Bernard Wood, of George Washington University in Washington DC, and colleagues suggests that homo rudolfensis and its close relative, Homo habilis, should be ejected from homo - bound, as it were, in adamantine chains and hurled headlong from the ethereal sky, as some poet or other mentioned in another context. The reason for this banishment is that these early examples of homo are really no closer to modern humans than, say, australopithecus - or, as it happens, kenyanthropus. Where does kenyanthropus fit into the great scheme of human evolution? The answer, at present, is that nobody knows, and Leakey and colleagues decline to speculate. At the moment, kenyanthropus adds an exclamation mark to what has been, for some time, the confused state of our understanding of human evolution. It points the way to discoveries of diverse ancients as yet hidden. The next few years promise to be ripe for discovery, if not for understanding. \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.

Ten years ago the submersible Alvin got stuck on the seabed. The pilot, Cindy Lee Van Dover, from the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, kept calm. None of the prisoners drowned. </p> <p>Dr Van Dover is part of a team who will be exploring the seafloor along the mid ocean ridge from March 27 to May 5. Her research primarily focuses on the biodiversity of hydrothermal vents. Deep sea hydrothermal vents were discovered for the first time in the late seventies. These are giant chimneys produced when the earth's tectonic plates inch apart. They release clouds of sulphur, heavy metals and hot water into the ocean. It was believed that few if any creatures could survive at that depth, in both freezing and boiling conditions, and without light. But in fact they are home to colonies of albino fish, crabs, shrimps and giant tubeworms. </p> <p>\"The seafloor is one of the most significant extreme environments on the planet,\" says Dr Richard Lutz, from Rutgers University, New Jersey, who was on board Alvin when it got stuck in the mud. The seabed is also one of the last unexplored environments on the planet. Only a fraction of the 60,000-plus kilometres of the oceanic ridge where vents occur has been explored. </p> <p>What Dr Van Dover's research may settle once and for all is an age-old argument about biodiversity. The godfather of plant and animal classification, Carl Linnaeus, thought that all existing species had survived the flood by clinging to the slopes of Mt Ararat and that as a result, each species had become adapted to a specific elevation. In the post-diluvial era, species lived at the same height they had occupied on Mt Ararat wherever they were in the world. Aside from the flood, the idea that species live in the same kind of environment the world over is not that corny. In contrast, Comte de Buffon, a contemporary of Linnaeus, believed that environmentally similar but geographically isolated regions would have distinct types of species. </p> <p>The deep sea is a perfect place to test the two theories. Recent trips to the ocean floor have thrown up even more surprises. Although there appears to be no light, the shrimp have \"eyes\" in the middle of their backs which see light generated by the heat of the hydrothermal vents. The temperature gradient can range from zero outside the chimney walls to 350 C inside. Dr Carl Wisen, from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Massachusetts, has discovered bacteria that can survive these extremes. \"Chemosynthesis [using chemicals as a source of energy] is not unique, it was discovered a hundred years ago,\" he says. \"What is unique is that these bacteria are using hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide from the heart of the earth.\" </p> <p>Many of the creatures round the vents have relationships where they are dependent upon one another: for instance, the shrimp are covered by filaments composed of microbes upon which they graze; there are lawns of micro-organisms growing over mussels, vast bacterial mats several centimetres thick drift up and down in the water column; many organisms excrete sulphur, others eat heavy metals. \"These creatures are closely related to the ancestral organisms on earth,\" says Dr Wisen. \"They are living fossils.\" </p> <p>A new species, the Pompeii worm, was first described in the eighties and is found in colonies alongside the hot chimneys. These are about 6-8cm long, live in a tube and as Dr Stephen Cary, from the University of Delaware in Newark, has discovered, the worms are covered with a fleece of bacteria a centimetre thick. The worms secrete mucus which the bacteria feed on. Since there is no such thing as a free lunch, the bacteria are probably providing some benefit to the worm, perhaps acting as a protective coat. Dr Cary wanted to find out what life inside the tube was like for the worm and so he asked one of the submersible pilots to push a tiny probe inside one. The sound track to the accompanying video was rather purple as the operator struggled to insert a probe the thickness of a needle into a tiny hole on the side of a hot chimney using a robot arm attached to the sub. </p> <p>The resulting data showed that the temperature at one end of the tube was between 80-100 C, at the other it was nearer 20 C. This is a huge temperature variation for one animal to be able to tolerate, and the Pompeii worm is now considered the most heat tolerant animal on the planet. As a result of this variation in temperature, different species of bacteria live at different ends of the worm. Dr Cary is particularly excited about the worm's fleecy coating because these bacteria could contain enzymes that might be useful in the production of food, textiles, paper, detergents and pharmaceuticals, and as a result of his research, he has been asked to collaborate with the biotech company Diversa. </p> <p>Dr Van Dover looks at overall numbers of these weird and wonderful creatures. She samples plots of mussels and anything living on or around them from various different sites. Her hypothesis, based on the mussels she has collected so far, is that there is a strong correlation between the rate at which species spread from one vent to another and the number of vents. This in turn affects overall species diversity. For instance, the Mid Atlantic ridge has relatively few hydrothermal vents and the vents are low in diversity. Therefore, there is a direct link between diversity and planetary activity - as the earth's tectonic plates pull apart, hydrothermal vents are created. The Mid Atlantic ridge is only pulling apart at a rate of 20mm a year and she collects about 22 species larger than a quarter of a mil limetre in her sample pots. In contrast, the East Pacific rise is moving at a rate of 16cm a year, and she has collected over twice the number of species. In other words, says Dr Van Dover, Buffon was right, environmentally similar but geographically isolated areas do give rise to different numbers and types of species. </p> <p>Dr Van Dover clearly loves her work: she says the tubeworms are \"exquisite, I could talk about them all day\", and she is \"like a kid playing in a rock pool\". Very few people will ever have the pleasure of being cramped into a tiny submersible with two miles of water above them, but in May 2002 an Imax film will be released which shows incredible footage from the hydrothermal vents. \"The pilots say it looks better than being there yourself,\" says Dr Lutz. </p> <p>\u0095 Daily updates from March 27 at: <a href=\"http://www.divediscover.whoi.edu  \">www.divediscover.whoi.edu</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>It has been a mixed month for the betting industry. While it has suffered from the cancellation of last week's Cheltenham horse racing festival at the hands of foot and mouth disease, it has also celebrated the chancellor's decision to axe betting tax in the bookies' high street shops. </p> <p>For the online betting websites this has had a much lesser impact - they don't rely on a chain of high street outlets broadcasting horse racing for their income, and the UK market represents an ever-diminishing slice of their revenue. Instead they increasingly seek to feed the global appetite for betting on an array of sports and esoteric products. </p> <p>An example of this demand for a greater variety of betting vehicles is the hamster racing that online gambling operation <a href=\"http://www.Bluesq.com\">Bluesquare</a> runs each day. This follows the company's successful season of snail racing last year. Ed Pownall, public relations manager for Bluesquare, says: \"It's good fun and has been perfect timing with Cheltenham called off. We took 324 bets on the first race on March 5 - double anything we took on the snails. We even had a bet of \u00a3100 at 9/2.\" The company is also considering hog racing but has discarded greyhound racing - unlike specialist website 24dogs.com - as it can lead to a blurred image on live webcam recordings. </p> <p>Although this may all be particularly quirky and amount to small change in the annual \u00a31 trillion that makes up annual global betting turnover, Pownall says it highlights the changing nature of betting being led by the online operators. </p> <p>Renowned bookmaker Victor Chandler, chairman of Gibraltar-based offshore operator Victor Chandler International, agrees that the online players are driving change in a sector that is forecast by research company Datamonitor to grow from a current $7bn a year turnover to $123bn by 2004. Chandler says: \"I always had a feeling that technology would change the world. With the advent of mobile phones you now can't hide from your wife. And I think there will be more to come.\" </p> <p>Chandler says he has also recognised the growing interest by women in gambling online and to tackle this he recently launched <a href=\"http://www.thespinroom.com\">The Spin Room</a>. A \u00a32m investment provides punters with a range of 10 online casino-style games including blackjack, roulette and poker. \"The proportion of women is high in casinos - this is a great surprise to many,\" he says. </p> <p>However, Pownall tempers this. \"The idea that everyone is betting is a myth. That every Mrs Mop is having a bet on Eastenders is not true.\" But he doesn't deny that the internet is expanding the demographics of gamblers beyond the typical over-45-year-old male who regularly visits his local bookies. </p> <p>The Spin Room follows on the heels of the launch by Chandler of BetFC - a standalone football betting site - and is part of his attempt to move away from his reliance on horse racing. He also has plans to introduce a 3D online casino and Spot the Ball competitions. </p> <p>Although he still takes a greater volume of bets on the horses, he says average wagers on football are much larger, with three times the amount of money being bet on the UK's national sport. Unlike the horses it is also a global sport and is part of the reason why 60% of his business now derives from South-east Asia. \"The growth there is enormous. In Singapore every home has broadband,\" says Chandler. This is helping the company to shift more of the 30% of the bets it takes over the telephone onto the internet. </p> <p>Mark Blandford, founder and managing director of Alternative Investment Market-listed Sportingbet.com, has reduced this to only 15% (85% internet) as he also attacks the global betting market. Only 7% of its \u00a3103m of turnover for the last quarter of 2000 was derived from the UK. The remainder was made up of 50% in the US, 10% in Canada, 20% in South-east Asia and 13% elsewhere. Like many of the online players, Sportingbet.com offers a diverse array of events to bet on including 19 soccer leagues around the world, US Indy car racing and American football, alongside horse racing. </p> <p>Blandford says even the name of his business was created with global expansion in mind. \"Our brand is purpose-designed for being global. It says what it does - it is generic and translates into all languages. I doubt whether there is a Cantonese translation for Ladbrokes. They have a hard job on their hands to leverage their brand from the UK where it is strong.\" </p> <p>Bluesquare is hoping to be successful overseas by this same route. \"It's easier to springboard overseas for us with a strong UK base. Take the Japanese, they love the idea of the Jockey Club,\" says Pownall, who cites this betting-mad country as accounting for 66% of the world's legal horse racing betting. </p> <p>Once overseas, Bluesquare will hope to replicate some of its success in the UK where it has signed up around 110,000 registered users. The company also employs 15 full-time odds setters, since this will make it a creator of markets and give it more credibility. \"The big punters want to be secure so they prefer to deal with you rather than many of the smaller players who copy the odds of the larger operators,\" explains Pownall. As a result, the company was the only operator to make an online book on the US presidential election farce when it took \u00a380,000 - but made a small loss. </p> <p>Bluesquare is equally keen that its novelty bets are both competitive and appealing. \"They are proper bets - Elvis doesn't have to turn up and shoot Margaret Thatcher for the customer to win,\" he says. </p> <p>But on one site, it is up to the punters themselves to ensure that bets are appealing. Person to person betting site Flutter.com acts as a platform for individuals to post bets and for these to be matched by opposing punters. In the process, Flutter.com takes a 5% commission on any winning bets.

      "bodyText": "It has been a mixed month for the betting industry. While it has suffered from the cancellation of last week's Cheltenham horse racing festival at the hands of foot and mouth disease, it has also celebrated the chancellor's decision to axe betting tax in the bookies' high street shops. For the online betting websites this has had a much lesser impact - they don't rely on a chain of high street outlets broadcasting horse racing for their income, and the UK market represents an ever-diminishing slice of their revenue. Instead they increasingly seek to feed the global appetite for betting on an array of sports and esoteric products. An example of this demand for a greater variety of betting vehicles is the hamster racing that online gambling operation Bluesquare runs each day. This follows the company's successful season of snail racing last year. Ed Pownall, public relations manager for Bluesquare, says: \"It's good fun and has been perfect timing with Cheltenham called off. We took 324 bets on the first race on March 5 - double anything we took on the snails. We even had a bet of \u00a3100 at 9/2.\" The company is also considering hog racing but has discarded greyhound racing - unlike specialist website 24dogs.com - as it can lead to a blurred image on live webcam recordings. Although this may all be particularly quirky and amount to small change in the annual \u00a31 trillion that makes up annual global betting turnover, Pownall says it highlights the changing nature of betting being led by the online operators. Renowned bookmaker Victor Chandler, chairman of Gibraltar-based offshore operator Victor Chandler International, agrees that the online players are driving change in a sector that is forecast by research company Datamonitor to grow from a current $7bn a year turnover to $123bn by 2004. Chandler says: \"I always had a feeling that technology would change the world. With the advent of mobile phones you now can't hide from your wife. And I think there will be more to come.\" Chandler says he has also recognised the growing interest by women in gambling online and to tackle this he recently launched The Spin Room. A \u00a32m investment provides punters with a range of 10 online casino-style games including blackjack, roulette and poker. \"The proportion of women is high in casinos - this is a great surprise to many,\" he says. However, Pownall tempers this. \"The idea that everyone is betting is a myth. That every Mrs Mop is having a bet on Eastenders is not true.\" But he doesn't deny that the internet is expanding the demographics of gamblers beyond the typical over-45-year-old male who regularly visits his local bookies. The Spin Room follows on the heels of the launch by Chandler of BetFC - a standalone football betting site - and is part of his attempt to move away from his reliance on horse racing. He also has plans to introduce a 3D online casino and Spot the Ball competitions. Although he still takes a greater volume of bets on the horses, he says average wagers on football are much larger, with three times the amount of money being bet on the UK's national sport. Unlike the horses it is also a global sport and is part of the reason why 60% of his business now derives from South-east Asia. \"The growth there is enormous. In Singapore every home has broadband,\" says Chandler. This is helping the company to shift more of the 30% of the bets it takes over the telephone onto the internet. Mark Blandford, founder and managing director of Alternative Investment Market-listed Sportingbet.com, has reduced this to only 15% (85% internet) as he also attacks the global betting market. Only 7% of its \u00a3103m of turnover for the last quarter of 2000 was derived from the UK. The remainder was made up of 50% in the US, 10% in Canada, 20% in South-east Asia and 13% elsewhere. Like many of the online players, Sportingbet.com offers a diverse array of events to bet on including 19 soccer leagues around the world, US Indy car racing and American football, alongside horse racing. Blandford says even the name of his business was created with global expansion in mind. \"Our brand is purpose-designed for being global. It says what it does - it is generic and translates into all languages. I doubt whether there is a Cantonese translation for Ladbrokes. They have a hard job on their hands to leverage their brand from the UK where it is strong.\" Bluesquare is hoping to be successful overseas by this same route. \"It's easier to springboard overseas for us with a strong UK base. Take the Japanese, they love the idea of the Jockey Club,\" says Pownall, who cites this betting-mad country as accounting for 66% of the world's legal horse racing betting. Once overseas, Bluesquare will hope to replicate some of its success in the UK where it has signed up around 110,000 registered users. The company also employs 15 full-time odds setters, since this will make it a creator of markets and give it more credibility. \"The big punters want to be secure so they prefer to deal with you rather than many of the smaller players who copy the odds of the larger operators,\" explains Pownall. As a result, the company was the only operator to make an online book on the US presidential election farce when it took \u00a380,000 - but made a small loss. Bluesquare is equally keen that its novelty bets are both competitive and appealing. \"They are proper bets - Elvis doesn't have to turn up and shoot Margaret Thatcher for the customer to win,\" he says. But on one site, it is up to the punters themselves to ensure that bets are appealing. Person to person betting site Flutter.com acts as a platform for individuals to post bets and for these to be matched by opposing punters. In the process, Flutter.com takes a 5% commission on any winning bets. Although Chandler says there is a place for Flutter.com in the market, he adds that \"people need confidence and many people don't know it's out there\". This certainly isn't because of a lack of media attention, since the company has enjoyed plenty of column inches since it launched 12 months ago. But Josh Hannah, co-founder of Flutter.com, says it has been more difficult than he imagined to explain the concept of person-to-person betting. \"It has been surprising to me as it seems so obvious but it's a continuous challenge to us,\" he says. It is certainly no challenge for its customers to think up a myriad of bets and there are thousands of unusual bets available on the site at any one time. These include whose picture will be on the front page of the newspapers tomorrow. Surprisingly, Tony Blair is often quoted but is not pictured that often. There's even a bet on whether Flutter.com will go bust before the end of August. Having raised $38m in May and spent little on marketing, and delayed expansion overseas, the ungenerous odds of 2/1 not surprisingly raise a smile from Hannah.

      "body": "<p><strong> Bush net</strong><br> Bush Radio is again trying to marry PC and TV technology. Due in July for around \u00a31,000, the Ultimate MM is billed as an \"entertainment PC that sits under the TV\". It combines a TiVo-style personal video recorder with a DVD player and net access. </p> <p>The video recorder, which features programming facilities more akin to those in VCRs than that offered by TiVo, records shows on a 40 gigabyte hard disk. Users will be able to pause and rewind live programmes. They can also download and store MP3 files and stream radio and TV via the net. </p> <p>Bush is also launching a hard disk video recorder without an electronic programming guide, the \u00a3400 DVR-2001, in the summer. </p> <p>On sale next month are a pair of widescreen TVs, the \u00a3599 28-inch DVD660 and \u00a3799 DVD760, which feature integrated DVD players. In June, Bush is launching a budget take on the personal DVD player/LCD screen combi -the \u00a3500 PDVD 1000. A screenless personal player, the DVD1000, goes on sale for \u00a3150. </p> <p>Bush's sister company, Roadstar, has come up with an ingenious solution to the problem of keeping youngsters entertained in the car. The \u00a3300 Watch'N'Go 4PKWNG4, a portable in-car video system, features a mini-sized VCR and a 4-inch LCD screen tucked inside a rucksack-style bag. When the pack unravels, its handles can be used to attach it to the back of a car seat. The unit is powered via a car's cigarette adaptor. A DVD version is expected next year. </p> <p><strong> Hitachi's RAM </strong><br> Hitachi's long-promised DVD-ram camcorder finally makes it to the UK this month. The \u00a31,800 DZ-MV100E uses double-sided 8cm re-writable DVD-ram discs to store up to 2.8 gigabytes, or an hour of high quality MPEG2 video (two hours if standard mode is used). </p> <p>The discs, expected to retail for around \u00a320, are compatible with DVD-ram PC drives and video recorders, available later in the year. </p> <p>The camera creates a visual table of contents for each disc by displaying a still image of the beginning of each section of footage. Users can either access those scenes, or create a play list of scenes for transferring to a PC, videotape or, in the future, DVD. </p> <p>The DZ-MV100E also takes digital still images with a resolution of 1.1 megapixels. Other facilities include a 12x optical, and 4x digital zoom, image stabilisation options, auto-exposure modes and 3.5-inch LCD monitor. </p> <p><strong> Summer hoot</strong><br> Sony is planning new digital camera models in the high-end Cyber Shot and entry-level Mavica range. </p> <p>CD-RW compatibility has been added to two new Mavica models - the MVC-CD200 and MVC-CD300. The new 156MB 8cm CD-RW discs, which will retail for around \u00a313, allows users to delete images without reducing the amount of space on the disc. The CD200 has an image resolution of 2.1 megapixels and a 3x digital zoom and is likely to retail for around \u00a3700. The \u00a31,000 CD300 is capable of 3.3 megapixel images, has a 3x digital zoom and sports a Carl Zeiss lens. Also new are a quartet of Mavica models that store images on a standard 3.5-inch floppy disk. </p> <p>The Cyber Shot range, which use Sony's Memory Stick storage system, has three additions, the DSC-75, DSC-P50 and DSC-P30. The top-end model, the DSC-75, features an image resolution of 3.3 megapixels, a 3x optical and 6x digital zoom, a Carl Zeiss lens and comes with an 8MB Memory Stick. Prices are not available. (AN) </p> <p><strong> 1GHz to go</strong></p> <p> Notebook PCs have always used slower chips than desktop models, because of the twin problems of dissipating heat and extending battery life. Intel narrowed the gap slightly this week by launching a 1GHz Mobile Pentium III, and a string of PC companies announced new models based on the chip, including Compaq (Presario 1800) and Hewlett-Packard (Omnibook 6000). However, the 1GHz processor is very expensive ($722 each if you buy a thousand) and it uses Intel's SpeedStep technology. In other words, it normally runs at 700MHz when on battery power, and at 1GHz when the notebook is plugged in to the mains. For value-conscious buyers, Intel also introduced a 900MHz Mobile Pentium III ($562) and a 750MHz Mobile Celeron ($170). AMD is expected to announce a 1GHz version of its Athlon processor for notebooks in the summer.</p> <p> <strong> Pockets</strong></p> <p> Hewlett-Packard could attract a wider range of buyers to Microsoft's Pocket PC system with a cheaper Jornada 525 palmtop computer, announced today. The 525 is slim and stylish but only has a 256-colour LCD. This does not look as good as other Pocket PC screens, but it still has the higher resolution that makes it much easier to read than the Palm IIIc and similar Palm OS models with colour screens. HP has also launched its own plug-in digital camera for HP Jornada Pocket PCs, the camera electronics being developed at HP's research lab in Bristol. Users can add voice annotations to their pictures and email them to friends, because the Pocket PC mail software can handle attachments. Finally, HP has produced a slightly cheaper version of the clamshell-style Jornada 720, which has an outstanding tiny keyboard. The Jornada 710 looks to be the same but leaves out the modem. </p> <p> <strong> Palm off</strong></p> <p> Last year, Microsoft stole a march on Palm by launching its Pocket PC software, which included an MP3 player, electronic book reader and other advanced features. Handspring also stole a march on the market leader by launching Palm-compatible machines with Handspring expansion slots. Palm has now responded. It plans to ship two new V-style palmtops, the m500 and m505, with multimedia and e-book software included in Palm OS 4, and SD expansion slots. Palm has also taken over Peanut.com, an electronic book publisher. The Peanut Reader software is being renamed Palm Reader. While adding an expansion slot was long overdue, buyers of Palm OS handhelds will face a plethora of incompatible choices: SD, Springboard, Sony Memory Stick and CompactFlash. (JS)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bush net Bush Radio is again trying to marry PC and TV technology. Due in July for around \u00a31,000, the Ultimate MM is billed as an \"entertainment PC that sits under the TV\". It combines a TiVo-style personal video recorder with a DVD player and net access. The video recorder, which features programming facilities more akin to those in VCRs than that offered by TiVo, records shows on a 40 gigabyte hard disk. Users will be able to pause and rewind live programmes. They can also download and store MP3 files and stream radio and TV via the net. Bush is also launching a hard disk video recorder without an electronic programming guide, the \u00a3400 DVR-2001, in the summer. On sale next month are a pair of widescreen TVs, the \u00a3599 28-inch DVD660 and \u00a3799 DVD760, which feature integrated DVD players. In June, Bush is launching a budget take on the personal DVD player/LCD screen combi -the \u00a3500 PDVD 1000. A screenless personal player, the DVD1000, goes on sale for \u00a3150. Bush's sister company, Roadstar, has come up with an ingenious solution to the problem of keeping youngsters entertained in the car. The \u00a3300 Watch'N'Go 4PKWNG4, a portable in-car video system, features a mini-sized VCR and a 4-inch LCD screen tucked inside a rucksack-style bag. When the pack unravels, its handles can be used to attach it to the back of a car seat. The unit is powered via a car's cigarette adaptor. A DVD version is expected next year. Hitachi's RAM Hitachi's long-promised DVD-ram camcorder finally makes it to the UK this month. The \u00a31,800 DZ-MV100E uses double-sided 8cm re-writable DVD-ram discs to store up to 2.8 gigabytes, or an hour of high quality MPEG2 video (two hours if standard mode is used). The discs, expected to retail for around \u00a320, are compatible with DVD-ram PC drives and video recorders, available later in the year. The camera creates a visual table of contents for each disc by displaying a still image of the beginning of each section of footage. Users can either access those scenes, or create a play list of scenes for transferring to a PC, videotape or, in the future, DVD. The DZ-MV100E also takes digital still images with a resolution of 1.1 megapixels. Other facilities include a 12x optical, and 4x digital zoom, image stabilisation options, auto-exposure modes and 3.5-inch LCD monitor. Summer hoot Sony is planning new digital camera models in the high-end Cyber Shot and entry-level Mavica range. CD-RW compatibility has been added to two new Mavica models - the MVC-CD200 and MVC-CD300. The new 156MB 8cm CD-RW discs, which will retail for around \u00a313, allows users to delete images without reducing the amount of space on the disc. The CD200 has an image resolution of 2.1 megapixels and a 3x digital zoom and is likely to retail for around \u00a3700. The \u00a31,000 CD300 is capable of 3.3 megapixel images, has a 3x digital zoom and sports a Carl Zeiss lens. Also new are a quartet of Mavica models that store images on a standard 3.5-inch floppy disk. The Cyber Shot range, which use Sony's Memory Stick storage system, has three additions, the DSC-75, DSC-P50 and DSC-P30. The top-end model, the DSC-75, features an image resolution of 3.3 megapixels, a 3x optical and 6x digital zoom, a Carl Zeiss lens and comes with an 8MB Memory Stick. Prices are not available. (AN) 1GHz to go Notebook PCs have always used slower chips than desktop models, because of the twin problems of dissipating heat and extending battery life. Intel narrowed the gap slightly this week by launching a 1GHz Mobile Pentium III, and a string of PC companies announced new models based on the chip, including Compaq (Presario 1800) and Hewlett-Packard (Omnibook 6000). However, the 1GHz processor is very expensive ($722 each if you buy a thousand) and it uses Intel's SpeedStep technology. In other words, it normally runs at 700MHz when on battery power, and at 1GHz when the notebook is plugged in to the mains. For value-conscious buyers, Intel also introduced a 900MHz Mobile Pentium III ($562) and a 750MHz Mobile Celeron ($170). AMD is expected to announce a 1GHz version of its Athlon processor for notebooks in the summer. Pockets Hewlett-Packard could attract a wider range of buyers to Microsoft's Pocket PC system with a cheaper Jornada 525 palmtop computer, announced today. The 525 is slim and stylish but only has a 256-colour LCD. This does not look as good as other Pocket PC screens, but it still has the higher resolution that makes it much easier to read than the Palm IIIc and similar Palm OS models with colour screens. HP has also launched its own plug-in digital camera for HP Jornada Pocket PCs, the camera electronics being developed at HP's research lab in Bristol. Users can add voice annotations to their pictures and email them to friends, because the Pocket PC mail software can handle attachments. Finally, HP has produced a slightly cheaper version of the clamshell-style Jornada 720, which has an outstanding tiny keyboard. The Jornada 710 looks to be the same but leaves out the modem. Palm off Last year, Microsoft stole a march on Palm by launching its Pocket PC software, which included an MP3 player, electronic book reader and other advanced features. Handspring also stole a march on the market leader by launching Palm-compatible machines with Handspring expansion slots. Palm has now responded. It plans to ship two new V-style palmtops, the m500 and m505, with multimedia and e-book software included in Palm OS 4, and SD expansion slots. Palm has also taken over Peanut.com, an electronic book publisher. The Peanut Reader software is being renamed Palm Reader. While adding an expansion slot was long overdue, buyers of Palm OS handhelds will face a plethora of incompatible choices: SD, Springboard, Sony Memory Stick and CompactFlash. (JS)",

It made me feel like a Dickensian waif staring in the rich family's window watching them tuck into a slap-up meal. The new technologies have a lot to offer the classroom of the future, but the big drawback is that these wonderful devices come at a price. </p> <p>The raw economic truth is that those of us in the bottom half of our two-tier education system are simply doing our best to keep our heads above water. Year on year our budgets are cut, even though our pupil numbers increase. We are told that all secondary schools have achieved a pupil-computer ratio of at least 8 to 1 and will be at 5 to 1 by 2004; the truth is that we are struggling to hold it at 13 to 1. </p> <p>I'm afraid the cold reality for many of us at the chalk face bears little resemblance to the brave new world that you describe. <br> <strong> Jeremy Smith</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailtp:jd.smith@ukonline.co.uk\">jd.smith@ukonline.co.uk</a> </p> <p>I was interested to read about the interactive whiteboard (whiteboards replaced blackboards years ago) and that teachers are enthusiastic about it \"not least because lessons can be prepared at home (where else?) on the laptop\". Would this be the laptop that will cost me more than one-tenth of my annual salary? Government help with hardware is only available for maths teachers of 11 to 14-year-olds. <br> <strong> Victoria Paleit</strong> <br> Southmoor, Oxon </p> <p><strong> Flash flood</strong><br> Nick Clayton (Second Sight, March 15) is absolutely right: it's time for the Flash Back(f)lash. To all the Flash animators out there I say this: you know that bit where it says \"Skip Intro\"? That's where I click, every time.

It made me feel like a Dickensian waif staring in the rich family's window watching them tuck into a slap-up meal. The new technologies have a lot to offer the classroom of the future, but the big drawback is that these wonderful devices come at a price. The raw economic truth is that those of us in the bottom half of our two-tier education system are simply doing our best to keep our heads above water. Year on year our budgets are cut, even though our pupil numbers increase. We are told that all secondary schools have achieved a pupil-computer ratio of at least 8 to 1 and will be at 5 to 1 by 2004; the truth is that we are struggling to hold it at 13 to 1. I'm afraid the cold reality for many of us at the chalk face bears little resemblance to the brave new world that you describe. Jeremy Smith jd.smith@ukonline.co.uk I was interested to read about the interactive whiteboard (whiteboards replaced blackboards years ago) and that teachers are enthusiastic about it \"not least because lessons can be prepared at home (where else?) on the laptop\". Would this be the laptop that will cost me more than one-tenth of my annual salary? Government help with hardware is only available for maths teachers of 11 to 14-year-olds.

P2P avoids this problem by putting all the strain on the user.

As one user put it, with remarkable restraint, \"I appreciate the effort to help us, but I think I speak for a large group of people when I say that I can not download anything !\" </p> <p> Limewire ( www.limewire.com ) is a nicer looking interface with some useful gimmicks, for example, the ability to perform multiple simultaneous searches, each of which is tabbed in the main window. Also useful is the ability to define your minimum download speed, so if you have ADSL or cable and wish to avoid users with humble 56k modems, you can. The searches are quick and unusually productive (I found over 3,000 Madonna files in seconds plus most of the UK top 20). </p> <p>However, 20 attempts to download the same track all ended in a connection failure, and the one success I did have (downloading a 15mb mpeg file) took over an hour to complete despite my ultra-fast ADSL connection.

It is also one of the easiest to use, accepting both Bearshare and Limewire users and clearly marking which clients are using firewalls, which may make the files harder to download. Once again you can perform multiple searches and the results were both faster and more plentiful than Limewire. </p> <p>There's even a snazzy window to show how your transactions are eating up the available bandwidth. However, the success rate was appalling, with fewer than two files transferring from the 50 or so I tried, and it was appallingly slowly given both parties were using cable modems. The final site, <a href=\"http://gnutella.wego.com\" target=\"_new\">Gnutella</a>, has been around for a while now. It originally provided the core code for the first true alternative to Napster, but is now more of a community for other P2P engines.</p> <p> The key advantage of using a Gnutella variant is that you can swap almost any kind of media file over them, including pictures (JPEGs and GIFs), MPEG or AVI video files or small application programmes as well as the most popular MP3 music format.

Here was a fluid and functioning music sharing system, with a world class search engine, one of the best instant messaging facilities around, and a built in media player so you could preview files as they were downloading. In comparison, the new wave of P2P engines are slow, inaccurate and largely ineffective. </p> <p> Admittedly, some of this is down to the nature of the files - an MPEG video is much bigger than an MP3 file, consequently the host you are trying to download from handles fewer simultaneous connections, each taking longer to deal with. There is, of course, another problem with most of these P2P programs. Once activated, the software will scan your drive for files you wish to share with fellow thieves (sorry, users). Unfortunately, once the world can see your own files, it also knows a fair amount about your personal habits. Got any embarrassing JPEGs? (be honest, now). Well, prepare to let colleagues, friends and file sharers see them too. Admittedly, there are ways of selecting which files you choose to share, but as many users will use the same folder for uploads and downloads, red faces are probably inevitable. </p> <p> All in all, however, if this is the future of P2P, Metallica has nothing to worry about.

The note at the end of the piece about the 60/40 split in funding between social services and Barnado's applies only to the Gloucestershire Leaving Care project and not to Barnado's as a whole. In a football league roundup, page 30 (Sport), yesterday, we said \"Blackpool moved up to fourth in the Third Division table with Matt Lockwood's brilliant free-kick giving them a 1-0 win over ... Leyton Orient.\" Matt Lockwood did indeed score from a free-kick but he plays for Orient, who beat Blackpool 1-0 and not vice versa. Blackpool thus remain fifth in the table. Homophone corner, from page 5, G2, yesterday: \"If you are a footballer or an actor - to all intense and purposes people who do something dramatic - then in a sense it's part of the pantomime.\" \u0095 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

      "body": "<p>The Spanish writer, lecturer and broadcaster Rafael Mart\u00ednez Nadal, who has died aged 97, was a close friend of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, and his outlook was shaped by the brilliant generation of Spanish artists who blossomed in the 1920s. He met Lorca at Madrid's famous Residencia de Estudiantes in the 1920s. On July 13 1936, after the murder of Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo, which made the generals' uprising imminent, Lorca entrusted to Nadal a bundle of manuscripts that included the remarkable homoerotic play El P\u00fablico.</p> <p>Born in Madrid, Rafael Nadal had a sickly childhood, but became a middleweight boxing champion, and then an active opponent of the 1920s dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, an enthusiast for the Second Republic of 1931 and a habitu\u00e9 of literary circles. In 1933, having com pleted his studies at Madrid University, he took up a one-year post at the University of Poitiers as lector, visiting London in 1934 and finally settling there after escaping from Franco's Spain in 1936.</p> <p>During the second world war, under the pseudonym Antonio Torres, he broadcast a weekly programme to Spain for the BBC. Though the British government and BBC had a policy of appeasing Franco, he managed to retain credibility with listeners within Spain by attacking Hitler and Mussolini. Despite this softly softly approach he was suspended for four months in 1943, due to pressure from Britain's pro-Franco ambassador in Madrid, Samuel Hoare.</p> <p>From 1936-76, Nadal worked in London as university lecturer, broadcaster at the BBC's Bush House (1940-44) and as Spanish affairs correspondent of the Observer (1944-53). In 1939, he had helped Stephen Spender on a translation of Lorca's poems, writing a lengthy introduction, but it was not until his retirement that his literary life really began. He worked with Kathleen Raine on her 1969 translation of Calder\u00f3n's Life Is A Dream, and in 1981 he translated her poems into Spanish. In 1972, he finally published Lorca's openly sexual, unfinished play El P\u00fablico. The reaction of the Lorca family was fierce: they sought to suppress publication, hating any reference to the playwright's homosexuality. There were essays and books on Lorca, but never enough, and many secrets of Lorca's private life go to the grave with Nadal.</p> <p>Athletic-looking and handsome, with a big nose and thick glasses, Nadal was always extraordinarily affable and kindly. He put pleasure in life and loyalty to his friends above literary fame. He is survived by his wife, a son and daughter.</p> <p><b> Jack Sage writes:</b> Rafael Nadal said of his years at the University of Madrid and the Residencia de Estudiantes: \"I had the tremendous good fortune to be a Madrilenian living through a period when our city was lavished with a wealth of talent...\" Indeed, he rubbed shoulders with artists like Gregorio Prieto and Dal\u00ed; musicians and musicologists like Andr\u00e9s Segovia, La Argentinita and Mart\u00ednez Torner; thinkers and writers like Salvador de Madariaga, D\u00e1maso Alonso and Jos\u00e9 Castillejo; and poets like Altolaguirre, Aleixandre, Cernuda, as well as Lorca.</p> <p>This wealth of talented characters could not have failed to shape him; what he did not say is that he helped to shape them too, just as he has helped to shape our awareness of modern Hispanic culture and politics. He was arguably the most important of the brilliant generation of Spanish civil war exiles in Britain, and certainly the most energetic and colourful.</p> <p>He died while preparing his fourth - as he loved to put it - \"penultimate\" work. Of his 52 or so published works, half-a-dozen are seductive vignettes in which he set out in colourful but subtle brush strokes to outline the personal qualities and quirks of creative people he knew - including, of course, Lorca. Several rank as substantial landmarks, including: Poems by F Garc\u00eda Lorca, with English translations by Stephen Spender and JL Gili (1942); Lorca's El P\u00fablico (the English version of his Spanish study, 1974; facsimile edition, 1976); Luis Cernuda. El hombre y sus temas (1983); Lorca, As\u00ed que pasen cinco a\u00f1os (1983); Antonio Torres y la pol\u00edtica espa\u00f1ola del Foreign Office, 1940-1944 (1989); Ecos cl\u00e1sicos en las obras de Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca y Luis Cernuda (1986).</p> <p>From 1936-76, Nadal taught in the department of Spanish at King's College in the University of London. He had the rare virtue of being able to expound from intimate inside knowledge, in lectures and in scintillating conversations, the difficult poems of Lorca and others of that marvellous generation. If only because of that rare virtue, his determination to stand aloof from the current fascination with Lorca's homoeroticism, a critical fashion which he regarded as cramping, demands respect.</p> <p>He had an unforgettable gift for reciting poetry with oratorical relish. Ever a live wire, his energy led him to deploy other talents, such as producing student play performances, from Cervantes to modern zarzuelas, the highlight of which was the first performance in Britain of the revered zarzuela by Tom\u00e1s Bret\u00f3n, La verbena de la paloma. Such was his enthusiasm that he typically managed to goad a hesitant student - me - to take charge of the musical direction.</p> <p>It also led him to buy, in the 1950s, one of the much-used classic London Austin taxis which he referred to as his \"old lady\", and which he would gleefully drive around with demonic majesty.</p> <p>A celebrated raconteur, though he was as good a listener as talker, his stories ranged from the hilariously self-deprecating to the hair-raising. Of the latter were those about his perilous escape from Franco's Spain, and how a nameless friend in a position of strategic power astutely decoded and responded to a Nadal telegram regretting his delayed arrival in circumstances which \"you will understand\" needed \"urgent attention\", thus producing in the nick of time a reprieve from a \"nationalist\" order to have him shot along with 22 other Republicans seeking to escape from the fascist forces.</p> <p>\u0095 Rafael Mart\u00ednez Nadal, writer, born December 28 1903; died March 5 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Austrian political system has been thrown into turmoil again by a new wave of xenophobia generated by the former Freedom party leader J\u00f6rg Haider. Mr Haider, who remains the main force in the far-right party, is using the municipal elections in Vienna this weekend to resurrect his pet topics of immigration and \"over foreignisation\", stunning the party's senior partner in the government coalition, the People's party (OVP), into an embarrassed silence. Freedom party (FPO) election posters filled with anti-foreigner innuendo have been plastered around the capital. A firebrand populist, Mr Haider has riddled his speeches with anti-semitic comments and subliminal xenophobic messages of late, which have proved a considerable hit with voters. Political commentators say that \"Haiderism\" is far from dead and Mr Haider's recipe for pulling in the voters appears to be working. Recent polls have shown the FPO's support 10% down from the 28% it won in 1996, but in the past few days its standing has risen to 22%. Twenty percent of Austria's 8m people, a fifth of whom are foreigners, live in Vienna. The Social Democrats, who govern Vienna in coalition with the conservative OVP, are expected to win on Sunday, but not before Mr Haider attempts to rally his far-right army of voters. With one eye on a huge personal opportunity to regain the limelight this weekend, Mr Haider has abandoned the mountains of Carinthia, where he is governor, to boost his troubled party. During the national election campaign in October 1999 he was attacked by human rights organisations for the FPO's \"Stop the over-foreignisation\" posters in Vienna. Its message this time does not appear to be very different. \"Foreigners: I understand the concerns of the Viennese!\" one poster claims on behalf of the FPO's leader in Vienna, Helene Partik-Pable. Next to it is another saying: \"Crime: I also want a safe life!\" The posters appear side by side throughout the city. Mr Haider, famous for praising Hitler's employment policies and lauding SS veterans as \"men of character\", drew raucous laughter last month at a beer-hall gathering of FPO members by making fun of the first name of Ariel Muzicant, the head of Austria's Jewish community. \"How can a man with such a name have such dirt on his hands?\" he said. He later accused Mr Muzicant of \"unclean business practices\". What has disturbed his critics the most, however, is not his zenophobic outbursts, but the silence of the OVP. \"If I had said anything anti-semitic, then [Chancellor Wolfgang] Sch\u00fcssel would have protested,\" Mr Haider wrote in a newspaper commentary last week, referring to his comments about Mr Muzicant. Mr Sch\u00fcssel's only response was to say that Mr Haider had expressed a \"carnivalesque ribaldry\". Franz Fischler, the EU's Austrian agricultural commissioner, has entered the fray, saying he fears that Austria's reputation could be further damaged by Mr Haider's outbursts.\" We should be most concerned about the fact that, obviously, in Austria, those who make such comments can be sure of getting applause,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The Russian space station Mir dropped in altitude by more than two miles yesterday, bringing it close to its final orbit and its last blaze of glory tomorrow morning as it plunges to a fiery end after 15 years in service. With it will perish a Bible, a Koran, 11 tonnes of scientific equipment, more than 100 books left behind by astronauts, a \"greenhouse\" of experimental crops, personal items left by more than 100 visitors, uninvited fungi, a photograph of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space - and the hopes and dreams of a nation. The Russians, as leaders of the Soviet Union, were the first to launch a satellite into space, the first to put a man - and a woman - into orbit, the first to launch a group of people, and the first to keep humans in space for longer than a year. But the end of Mir signals the end of Russian independence at the highest frontier of all; Russia's next adventure in space is as a junior partner in the Nasa-led International Space Station, now taking shape in orbit. When Gagarin took to the skies almost 40 years ago, on April 12 1961, there was feverish delight, very different from the sober Soviet revolutionary parades for which workers were ordered out of their factories and onto the streets. As the smouldering remains of Mir plunge into the Pacific Ocean tomorrow, around 06.30 GMT, Russia may once again be united by a wave of collective emotion - this time regret. A sense of pride in its cosmic achievements has been reawakened in time only to mourn a symbolic end to an era of space supremacy. Sceptics describe Mir as a fault-ridden lump of rusting machinery.

So much was Mir a symbol of Russia's superpower status that MPs voted 298 to 3 in February to urge Mr Putin to save it. Leftwing commentators said the deliberate sinking of Mir represented an unforgivable surrender to American interests. The communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya compared the head of the Russian aerospace agency, Yury Koptyev, to the Taliban, saying that to sink Mir was a crime equivalent to the recent destruction of the ancient Buddha statues in Bamiyan, Afghanistan. The speaker of the lower house, the communist Gennady Seleznyov, called on the government to begin at once planning Mir 2, a project abandoned in 1990 as expensive and unnecessary. The offer last week by the president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, to pay for Mir to stay in orbit and train Iranian cosmonauts was far too late to reverse Mir's death plunge. The veteran cosmonaut Georgy Grechko, twice decorated as a Hero of the Soviet Union, said: \"Anyone who worked in the space industry will naturally be in mourning on Friday ...

I hesitate to say druids, but this was a time when lavish gifts were made to the gods in the fields and oak groves.\"",

Sarah (Amanda Holden) and Rob (Philip Glenister) have moved from London to a country estate. If you wonder where they got the money, and I always do wonder, Rob promotes rock concerts.

You need a sweet tooth for The Hunt. You need teeth for The Cops. It is drama that looks and sounds like documentary. You never catch anyone acting. You can look away casually then turn back quickly, when they least expect it, and still not catch them at it. The camera noses here and there like an eager but confused dog. The dialogue sounds improvised. The story whizzes past your ear like a bullet. Nothing is explained, you have to work at it. </p> <p>For instance, it started with Roy and Mel, whom we already know, which is just as well, arriving at some kerfuffle at the Caffreys'. \"What's happening here then?\" says Roy. \"You can fuck off\", is the instant rejoinder. The inspector arrives when things have calmed down a bit. He says, \"What's happening here then?\" You could hit him. </p> <p>It is a small world. Cops and robbers are on first name terms. They have their own language. The law-abiding seem to live on a different planet. As the girl in the back of the police car said, staring out of the window, \"The world looks different from in here.\" </p> <p>The Cops is hardly a recruiting poster for the police, but truth and gallows humour come off it in great waves. It is quite wonderful and - stick with it - it gets better. </p> <p>In <strong> The Human Face</strong> (BB C 1) John Cleese confessed, with more candour than common sense, to a couple of hair transplants. Really? Your eyes rose irresistibly. This week he was enthused by the theory that beauty is a matter of proportion: 1 to 1.618. This is the dullest discovery since America. Parkinson struggled to look interested. Cleese has the dazzling deafness of the true enthusiast. I've shared tables at all-night caf\u00e9s with men like that. </p> <p>It would, however, be a mistake to shake your watch crying, \"Heavens, is that the time!\", because suddenly Cleese will bring a haymaker up from the floor. Pierce Brosnan was complaining what a burden it was to be a thing of beauty. \"It pisses me off when they say I'm pretty. I always wanted to be rugged.

      "body": "<p>Something happened to photography in art galleries in the late 1970s. Artists rejected the idea that the camera recorded reality, that its mission was to tell the truth, that the great photographer found an image in the tumult of life. The camera does lie, they said, all the time, and what we will do is expose that and explore the camera's power to create not factual records but fictional narratives of real life. So Cindy Sherman photographed herself as a Hitchcock heroine and Jeff Wall placed a vast, naked old woman towering over students in a quiet and efficient college library, in a mythic backlit vision of contemporary society. Artists became makers of static cinema. </p> <p> This fabulist turn in photography has almost become a cliche. Yet Settings and Players, a museum-quality show of American work in the commercial gallery White Cube 2, makes it interesting once more. </p> <p>The row over the photographs at the Saatchi Gallery by Tierney Gearon and Nan Goldin (who shows wonderful images here of drag stars' dressing rooms) demonstrated how compulsively we spin narratives out of photographs. The suspicions of the police and the News of the World can be seen as a narrative completion, as they imagined scenarios and possibilities - what happened next. The photograph is unresolved, a moment snatched from a story, a \"still\" as Sherman called her early pictures of herself in cinematic scenarios. The narrative can only be completed by you, the viewer, in your imagination. This means that the pictures in Settings andPlayers make us complicit in a special way: we engage in a collaboration of desire, as we flesh out the implications of the picture. </p> <p>Philip-Lorca diCorcia's Tim, 27, Orange County, LA, $30, and Gerald Hughes (aka Savage Fantasy), About 25 Years Old, Southern California, $50, tell us in their titles that they are images of rent boys. The pictures are monumental scenarios in which something is about to happen: Tim nervously pausing before entering a room, his profile flooded with light, Gerald framed in the doorway - both of them on a threshold, making a choice, pondering a fate. </p> <p>Larry Sultan's picture of a naked young man smoking on the sidewalk in the middle of the night takes us into a world of fabrication and obscurity. The mystery here lies in the relationship of the photographer to his subject. The photographer stands in the shadows, spying on the smoker. Is this a lover's view, or a killer's? Just as disconcerting is Sultan's image of young people having sex in the lounge of a family home. Or is it a porn film set? Richly kitsch-modern, with wood-style panelling, a raw stone column effect and a stippled beige sofa with a pile of cushions in which the boy's short-cropped head is visible next to the girl's leg, this room would be homely enough were it not brightly lit like a film set. </p> <p>This is the true art of suburbia. It's the vacancy of the materials - a barbecue, a payphone in the night - that makes these pictures slip so easily into fantasy. Sultan's picture Early Evening, Los Angeles has an old man looking out of his home into the evening gloom, except the twilight is unnaturally held off by electric light, the garden theatrically lit up, the flowers taking on dazzling hues in the artificial illumination. You think of a culture that holds off darkness, that pushes away time synthetically; in LA, even nature gets a facelift. </p> <p>This is a valid documentary picture of contemporary American life. Americans do light up their gardens and breed flowers with super-intense, synthetic hues. This is a fictive photograph, but it is also a realistic photograph of a culture in which fiction has replaced reality. Philip Roth has written of the despair of the novelist, whose job is to make up fictions that compete with the fantastic facts of American national life. American photographers didn't turn to fabulism for academic reasons, but because it was the only way to capture a country that constantly represents and mythifies itself. Richard Prince finds a solution in re-photographing images - found photos from adverts or magazines - to depict a colonised America whose contours were defined long before he got there. </p> <p>The weakest things in the show simply look as if the maker has seen one too many David Lynch movies: Anna Gaskell's pictures are contrived, kinky exercises. But the best - and there are a lot of outstanding pictures here - find mournful, ready-made narratives in the American landscape. Gregory Crewdson's panoramic views of gardens, apparently photographed from the roof of the house, take in an entire social world. In his picture of a family sitting down to a meal in a garden surrounded by dense forest - a patch of civilisation in the wilderness - the teenage son stands and watches a pall of smoke coming out from under a shed roof. </p> <p>The country in these pictures is so mythologised that it defies all the European photographic traditions. It comes prepackaged as a great novel. In William Eggleston's images of the South, people going about their lives seem compellingly part of some grand, terrible destiny. A student smoking, a toilet seen down a dark hallway lit in hellish red, a building photographed in half-shadow, seem full of devastating significance. Eggleston has said he thinks of his photographs as \"parts of a novel I'm doing\". </p> <p>If Richard Prince is American photography's Bret Easton Ellis, Eggleston is its William Faulkner. His South is a ripe, charismatic place. With their startling colour and radical arrangement of space, his pictures have an atmosphere you can taste, a tension you can feel. In Sumner, Mississippi, Cassidy Bayou In Background, taken in 1969 or 1970, a black man in a white jacket stands behind a white man in a black suit, both men in the same pose, hands in pockets, watching something we can't see. A car stands waiting, its driver glimpsed through the windscreen. Behind them trail anonymous woods, leading to a stretch of silver water. We don't know who they are, or why the car has stopped here. </p> <p>The powerful thing about a narrative image, whether it is a painting or a photograph, is its incompleteness. Eggleston's pictures are enigmatic fragments of some vast novel of class, race and power in America, and we probably don't want to know how it ends. </p> <p>\u0095 Settings and Players: Theatrical Ambiguity in American Photography is at White Cube 2 , London N1 (020-7930 5373), until April 14.</p>",

      "body": "<p>You wish it weren't true. But there it is: it's a shock to see a blonde, slight 31-year-old woman on the conductor's podium. Susanna Malkki is Finnish, a product of the same Helsinki conducting class, headed by the inspirational Jorma Panula, that has produced many of today's top conductors. Panula's unfussy, ungrand approach - \"he says that the conductor is there to help, but not get in the way\" - has worked for Malkki. Though she has not yet reached the giddy heights of fellow alumni Sakari Oramo, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Jukka-Pekka Saraste, a string of high-profile bookings from European and British orchestras mark her out as a name to watch. </p> <p>Malkki started out on the other side of the podium, as an orchestral cellist. \"I've learnt probably half of what I know as a conductor through being a player in orchestras, watching,\" she says. The only professional musician in a Helsinki family of gifted amateurs, she started the violin at five and switched to cello at nine, because it was \"more me\". By 1995, having studied at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and the Royal Academy of Music in London, she had a career lined up as a principal in Sweden's Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. </p> <p>\"But I had always been interested in conducting,\" she says. \"As an orchestral player I'd always analysed what worked and what didn't. Even after my cello studies the idea was still in my head. So I applied to the conducting course at the Sibelius Academy. But I didn't have any experience . . . It's difficult to say why they chose me. Maybe they saw I had something in my eye - even though my hands were not quite working.\" </p> <p>Malkki then spent a hyperactive period as an orchestral cellist in Sweden and a student conductor in Finland. \"It was interesting,\" she says with typical dryness. Eventually one part of her life had to give - and so, in the last year of her studies, she gave up the Gothenburg job, and stuck to conducting, the only woman in her class. It was the thrill of controlling the entire orchestra, as opposed to being a tiny cog in the wheel: \"I am fascinated by being in charge of the whole picture, and putting all the pieces together. There are so many details to find and colours to produce.\" She is wary about trying to define what's so special about the Helsinki course, talking about a firm grounding in technique, a happy, non-competitive atmosphere, and the availability of an orchestra to practise on \"rather than a couple of pianos\". </p> <p>In 1999, when she was working towards her final diploma, she got a break. She was conducting Thomas Ad\u00e8s's opera Powder Her Face at Helsinki's annual new music festival, Musica Nova. \"Tom came to the performance and he was very pleased with it,\" she says. \"Later that year he needed an assistant when he was doing the opera at the Almeida theatre in London and on tour. I ended up conducting some of the performances.\" This is a modest summation of the facts: there are those who say that she did a better job on Powder Her Face than the composer himself - her rendition was tight, disciplined, with not an inch of spare flesh on the bones of the music. </p> <p>From here sprang Malkki's relationship with the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, the ensemble she conducted for the opera performances. Ad\u00e8s is a fan; Simon Clugston, the group's artistic director, is clearly very impressed with her. \"I think she's got a great career coming,\" he says. \"She has a fantastic technique, the sort that allows her natural musicianship to come through. She's very strong and forthright. And conducting is one of the last bastions of male dominance.\" </p> <p>Does Malkki accept that her career represents a pretty tough life choice? That orchestral musicians and audiences alike can be conservative - unwilling to accept a woman on the podium? \"The history is like that, of course,\" says Malkki. \"But I want to believe that a good musician recognises another good musician. I really believe that it should be about music. I'm happy that I live now, rather than 50 years ago. That's all I want to say about it. I think that if I forget about it then others may forget about it too.\" </p> <p>Is she affected by the fact that she has no female role models (she says she admires many conductors, including Carlos Kleiber, Simon Rattle and Furtw\u00e4ngler? \"No, it doesn't bother me,\" she says, \"because I know why there aren't any. You can't divide this subject from the rest of history and society.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When most of us leave home in our late teens, it is a case of never looking back. You are on your own in the big, bad world of trying to find somewhere to live. Later, when you settle down and start to think about having a family of your own, there is a general expectation that you will have moved further up the property ladder and have found yourself a suitable-sized home.</p> <p>What if that has not happened? With rising house prices and a dearth of council property or affordable rented accommodation, it seems that some of us are looking at the once unthinkable prospect of moving back in with the parents - at least until we, the young parents or parent, find our financial feet.</p> <p>So what is it like to live in an intergenerational household? My friend Jenny would know because she has been doing it for six years in Seville, Spain, where such arrangements are commonplace. She and her husband Carlos share a large apartment with her mother- and father-in-law and have two children aged six and four.</p> <p>When she visits her friends and relatives in London, she has little that is positive to say about her domestic situation. There is no privacy. There is constant interference with the way she brings up her children. And she has to eat with the in-laws three or four nights a week.</p> <p>\"My mother-in-law completely dominates in the kitchen,\" she relates, \"and, of course, any notions I might have about healthy eating and what my children might need to eat are dismissed out of hand.\"</p> <p>Her husband does not see the problem; for him it is simply part of the accepted Latin way of life. \"All that babysitting,\" he points out. \"Which comes at such a price,\" she sighs.</p> <p>It is not just the \"Latin way\", however. In this country before the 1960s, when council rental was rare and mortgages hard to come by, intergenerational living was expected, endured and even enjoyed until the married offspring could afford to rent or buy their own place. Such family arrangements were a rich source of comic tension in the radio sitcom The Glums and the strip cartoons of Giles in the Daily Express, but Sheila Foreman, now 62, who lived with her parents-in-law in Manchester with her first child, finds it hard to remember much light relief in her and her husband's situation as a young married couple with a baby.</p> <p>\"I can honestly say that it was the worst time of my life,\" she recalls. \"There I was, wanting to start a new life away from my parents, and I found myself stuck with a new set of parents with new sets of rules.</p> <p>\"If it was difficult for me, it was even worse for my husband who just carried on having the same old rows and irritations - only now he had me on his back making things even worse between him and his mother. What was really awful was that we should have been grateful to them because they were letting us stay in their house practically rent-free.\"</p> <p>Oddly enough, though, her own experience has not put her off intergenerational living. Sheila's son, daughter-in-law and four-year-old grandson have lived in her and her husband's house in north London for the last two years.</p> <p>\"Property prices being what they are in Britain's big cities,\" she explains, \"they really couldn't afford anything in an area with decent schools and parks. Peter, my husband, and I discussed it at length and decided that we couldn't stand by while we seemed to be kicking around this house and they were crammed in somewhere too small. We weren't quite ready to sell the house to release capital for them either. So we decided to invite them to live here.\"</p> <p>The Foremans wisely put a small bathroom and kitchen in the lower half of the house, \"so that, even if they decide they can't stand it any more, we will be able to close it off and rent it out\". It seems like an obviously beneficial arrangement for the younger couple who make a contribution to all bills and pay a minimal rent, but what is in it for the senior couple?</p> <p>\"Well, it helps that we are dotty about our grandson, Toby,\" says Sheila. \"We each look after him one day a week and I really think that it helps keep us young and forward-looking. All of us are pretty laid-back and I think that is the real difference between my situation as a young parent and my son's.\"</p> <p>The Foremans' domestic arrangement has a definite logic, but how well does it work for Sheila's son, David, 33, and his wife, Gemma, 32?</p> <p>\"When I talk to my friends,\" says Gemma, \"I realise that it is really unusual to get on so well with your parents-in-law. The situation really takes the pressure off our marriage too, because we are able to go out and be alone together at least once a week. I know it might sound like we are really spoiled and getting everything out of it, but we try and help them as much as we can with shopping and cooking. There is also an unwritten agreement that this kind of help will increase as they get older.\"</p> <p>The relationship is so close that David and Gemma even go on holiday with his parents. But for most of us the idea of living with our parents, parents-in-law or children and children-in-law (let alone their children into the bargain) would be like being sentenced to an eternal Christmas of forced jollity, domestic tension and scary psychodramas. Phillipa Buchan, 38, and her partner might agree that this more closely describes their experience of moving in with her mother when Phillipa was pregnant.</p> <p>\"My mum and I thought it would be a great solution, and so I persuaded Richard - against his better judgment,\" admits Phillipa. \"Mum gets rather lonely at times and I thought that it would be lovely to have her to help with a new-born baby. Mum had a large spare room; our council flat was awful. We were full of optimism and thought that we were being really inventive in creating a new solution to family living.\"</p> <p>Phillipa gave up her flat, redecorated what used to be her old room and the small room nearby for the baby. But her mother, who had been so keen for her daughter and partner to move in, seemed to get cold feet. She started creating obstacles and conditions.</p> <p>\"The reality of us being there seemed to make mum very uncomfortable,\" Phillipa recalls. \"Actually, I don't think she was lonely at all, but had created a very nice quiet life for herself which, quite understandably, she wasn't willing to give up. I think she thought of herself as suited to co-operative living - but as soon as she saw me claiming my room back it filled her with dread. We fought all the time, and we soon all realised that it wasn't going to work - particularly with a baby around.</p> <p>\"Luckily, a friend offered us her flat to rent and I jumped at the chance. Mum is an excellent gran and sees my daughter at least once a week. There are no hard feelings about the whole dreadful idea. I just don't know what we were thinking of.\"</p> <p>David Little, family therapist and GP, agrees that this kind of intergenerational living would not suit all families: \"For many of us, it would just be too difficult not to fall back into old patterns of either childish or parental behaviour. And what if your child-rearing ideas differ from your parents or parents-in-law? How do you make sure that the grandparents feel that they are not being taken advantage of?

      "bodyText": "When most of us leave home in our late teens, it is a case of never looking back. You are on your own in the big, bad world of trying to find somewhere to live. Later, when you settle down and start to think about having a family of your own, there is a general expectation that you will have moved further up the property ladder and have found yourself a suitable-sized home. What if that has not happened? With rising house prices and a dearth of council property or affordable rented accommodation, it seems that some of us are looking at the once unthinkable prospect of moving back in with the parents - at least until we, the young parents or parent, find our financial feet. So what is it like to live in an intergenerational household? My friend Jenny would know because she has been doing it for six years in Seville, Spain, where such arrangements are commonplace. She and her husband Carlos share a large apartment with her mother- and father-in-law and have two children aged six and four. When she visits her friends and relatives in London, she has little that is positive to say about her domestic situation. There is no privacy. There is constant interference with the way she brings up her children. And she has to eat with the in-laws three or four nights a week. \"My mother-in-law completely dominates in the kitchen,\" she relates, \"and, of course, any notions I might have about healthy eating and what my children might need to eat are dismissed out of hand.\" Her husband does not see the problem; for him it is simply part of the accepted Latin way of life. \"All that babysitting,\" he points out. \"Which comes at such a price,\" she sighs. It is not just the \"Latin way\", however. In this country before the 1960s, when council rental was rare and mortgages hard to come by, intergenerational living was expected, endured and even enjoyed until the married offspring could afford to rent or buy their own place. Such family arrangements were a rich source of comic tension in the radio sitcom The Glums and the strip cartoons of Giles in the Daily Express, but Sheila Foreman, now 62, who lived with her parents-in-law in Manchester with her first child, finds it hard to remember much light relief in her and her husband's situation as a young married couple with a baby. \"I can honestly say that it was the worst time of my life,\" she recalls. \"There I was, wanting to start a new life away from my parents, and I found myself stuck with a new set of parents with new sets of rules. \"If it was difficult for me, it was even worse for my husband who just carried on having the same old rows and irritations - only now he had me on his back making things even worse between him and his mother. What was really awful was that we should have been grateful to them because they were letting us stay in their house practically rent-free.\" Oddly enough, though, her own experience has not put her off intergenerational living. Sheila's son, daughter-in-law and four-year-old grandson have lived in her and her husband's house in north London for the last two years. \"Property prices being what they are in Britain's big cities,\" she explains, \"they really couldn't afford anything in an area with decent schools and parks. Peter, my husband, and I discussed it at length and decided that we couldn't stand by while we seemed to be kicking around this house and they were crammed in somewhere too small. We weren't quite ready to sell the house to release capital for them either. So we decided to invite them to live here.\" The Foremans wisely put a small bathroom and kitchen in the lower half of the house, \"so that, even if they decide they can't stand it any more, we will be able to close it off and rent it out\". It seems like an obviously beneficial arrangement for the younger couple who make a contribution to all bills and pay a minimal rent, but what is in it for the senior couple? \"Well, it helps that we are dotty about our grandson, Toby,\" says Sheila. \"We each look after him one day a week and I really think that it helps keep us young and forward-looking. All of us are pretty laid-back and I think that is the real difference between my situation as a young parent and my son's.\" The Foremans' domestic arrangement has a definite logic, but how well does it work for Sheila's son, David, 33, and his wife, Gemma, 32? \"When I talk to my friends,\" says Gemma, \"I realise that it is really unusual to get on so well with your parents-in-law. The situation really takes the pressure off our marriage too, because we are able to go out and be alone together at least once a week. I know it might sound like we are really spoiled and getting everything out of it, but we try and help them as much as we can with shopping and cooking. There is also an unwritten agreement that this kind of help will increase as they get older.\" The relationship is so close that David and Gemma even go on holiday with his parents. But for most of us the idea of living with our parents, parents-in-law or children and children-in-law (let alone their children into the bargain) would be like being sentenced to an eternal Christmas of forced jollity, domestic tension and scary psychodramas. Phillipa Buchan, 38, and her partner might agree that this more closely describes their experience of moving in with her mother when Phillipa was pregnant. \"My mum and I thought it would be a great solution, and so I persuaded Richard - against his better judgment,\" admits Phillipa. \"Mum gets rather lonely at times and I thought that it would be lovely to have her to help with a new-born baby. Mum had a large spare room; our council flat was awful. We were full of optimism and thought that we were being really inventive in creating a new solution to family living.\" Phillipa gave up her flat, redecorated what used to be her old room and the small room nearby for the baby. But her mother, who had been so keen for her daughter and partner to move in, seemed to get cold feet. She started creating obstacles and conditions. \"The reality of us being there seemed to make mum very uncomfortable,\" Phillipa recalls. \"Actually, I don't think she was lonely at all, but had created a very nice quiet life for herself which, quite understandably, she wasn't willing to give up. I think she thought of herself as suited to co-operative living - but as soon as she saw me claiming my room back it filled her with dread. We fought all the time, and we soon all realised that it wasn't going to work - particularly with a baby around. \"Luckily, a friend offered us her flat to rent and I jumped at the chance. Mum is an excellent gran and sees my daughter at least once a week. There are no hard feelings about the whole dreadful idea. I just don't know what we were thinking of.\" David Little, family therapist and GP, agrees that this kind of intergenerational living would not suit all families: \"For many of us, it would just be too difficult not to fall back into old patterns of either childish or parental behaviour. And what if your child-rearing ideas differ from your parents or parents-in-law? How do you make sure that the grandparents feel that they are not being taken advantage of? How do you ensure that the younger couple do not feel that their life is not being interfered with or taken over by people of a different generation? There might also be a problem with the non-blood relation feeling left out and dominated by the rest of the family ... There are so many potential minefields.\" Of all of Dr Little's list of possible problems, the one which most intergenerational households seem to agree is the most sensitive is the question of different attitudes towards child-rearing. Even the easy-going Foremans disagreed sharply over breastfeeding. Gemma breast-fed Toby for two years, which Sheila found excessive. \"Sheila didn't breast-feed herself,\" says Gemma, \"and so couldn't help regarding me as a cave-woman even in the early months. As I went on and on with it, I think she found it quite obscene and would try to introduce Toby to bottles of formula milk and dummies when she was looking after him.\" So, if you are a parent or grandparent who is toying with the idea of this kind of arrangement, what would Dr Little advise before making a decision? \"Careful thought, a good deal of discussion about exactly how the financial and domestic divisions will work, thinking ahead as to what it might mean in 10 years' time - and, most importantly, a very, very big house.\"",

And is there a case for giving men more legal rights over abortion decisions than they currently possess?</p> <p>In a highly publicised court case, Stephen Hone, 24, from Coventry, applied to the high court for an injunction preventing his girlfriend Claire Hansell from having an abortion, due to take place yesterday. She is 12 weeks' pregnant and it may be several days before her side of the case is put before the judges. Hone's legal case, brought after he contacted the Pro-Life Alliance, is that Hansell has been examined by only one doctor instead of the two required by the 1967 Abortion Act and that no questions were asked about her physical and mental state or why she wanted a termination.</p> <p>Hone's moral case is that Hansell had wanted to have a child but changed her mind after she became pregnant, without consulting him. Whatever the substance of that claim, it illustrates the sentiments sometimes harboured by men about exclusion from decisions about abortion.</p> <p>Ann Furedi of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service says that even in loving relationships \"men might be more inclined to think of abortion as the solution to an unwanted pregnancy than women, whereas women might be more ambivalent\".</p> <p>Lisa Hallgarten, who is education development officer for Education for Choice, a charity which provides resources on abortion for teachers and young people, confirms the picture: \"You find that, in general, young men are much less resistant to the idea of abortion than young women. Most say they would want their girlfriends to have an abortion if the situation arose.\"</p> <p>Yet if men, on the whole, are more willing to consider abortion, they still tend to put women's preferences first. That is true even when they would rather the pregnancy continue but the woman would not. According to Bella Scott, a BPAS counsellor: \"Usually the woman's feelings have taken precedence. And whatever that decision is, the men are usually extremely supportive and caring towards their partners.\"</p> <p>Things have changed since the 70s. Furedi says: \"While men are now encouraged to share responsibility for contraception and childcare, which used to be seen very much in terms of women's rights, where abortion is concerned the view often persists that men should be shut out.\"</p> <p>The BPAS is keen to encourage men's involvement, although little research has been done into how this might be achieved. However, Dr Ellie Lee, a lecturer in sociology at Southampton University, learned more about how men think from her studies on women's decisions on abortion. \"There has been a massive change in the way men want to be involved in all areas of fertility and that shows very clearly in what women say.\"</p> <p>Lee found that women put their partners' views centre stage: \"When I asked women why they had requested an abortion, they all talked about their relationships and how their partners had reacted. What partners think is key to the decisions women make. There is no reason to believe it is less of a big deal for men. It is clear that they feel at an emotional level the same way women do, and like to be involved in the process.\"</p> <p>This was true of Richard Lawrenson, a designer in his mid-30s. Ten years ago, he and his girlfriend of the time found out she was pregnant. Although together for a year, it was, he says, \"by no means clear that we would stay together for the rest of our lives\". They hadn't planned a child. Yet Richard recalls many conflicting feelings: \"Like most men, I just hadn't thought about it. Suddenly, all sorts of scenarios race through your mind. I couldn't help thinking about what names we might choose, or what it would be like to go to a football match with a little boy who looked just like me. I veered between feeling great compassion towards my partner, and being incredibly selfish.\"</p> <p>But he always knew, deep down, what his position was. \"I wanted to be involved in the process of reaching a decision, but I also recognised that, in the end, the decision should ultimately be hers.\"</p> <p>This seems an ideal guiding principle. Men's feelings matter, but to contemplate giving them legal powers to force women to either have abortions or not is appalling and absurd. As Lee says: \"The appeal to men's rights is that a pregnant woman should be obliged to do something with her body that no one else is obliged to do. For a third party to be able to compel a woman to save a foetus goes way beyond existing principles of medical law. Clearly men can be hurt if a woman's decision on abortion isn't the one they want, but I think that should be seen as part and parcel of what goes with a relationship. Conflicts always occur, and it is always far better to resolve them through consenus.\"</p> <p>So how did things work out for Lawrenson's relationship after the termination? \"There was a period when things did feel a bit awkward, but it wasn't what spoiled things in the end. In fact, having the abortion allowed it to run its course, and carry on at the pace we wanted. It ended later, but for other reasons.\"</p> <p>However, ultimately, the question of rights is indivisible. In Furedi's words: \"If it comes to the crunch, the decision has to be between a woman and her doctor. No one else.\"</p>",

Yet Richard recalls many conflicting feelings: \"Like most men, I just hadn't thought about it. Suddenly, all sorts of scenarios race through your mind. I couldn't help thinking about what names we might choose, or what it would be like to go to a football match with a little boy who looked just like me. I veered between feeling great compassion towards my partner, and being incredibly selfish.\" But he always knew, deep down, what his position was. \"I wanted to be involved in the process of reaching a decision, but I also recognised that, in the end, the decision should ultimately be hers.\" This seems an ideal guiding principle. Men's feelings matter, but to contemplate giving them legal powers to force women to either have abortions or not is appalling and absurd. As Lee says: \"The appeal to men's rights is that a pregnant woman should be obliged to do something with her body that no one else is obliged to do. For a third party to be able to compel a woman to save a foetus goes way beyond existing principles of medical law. Clearly men can be hurt if a woman's decision on abortion isn't the one they want, but I think that should be seen as part and parcel of what goes with a relationship. Conflicts always occur, and it is always far better to resolve them through consenus.\" So how did things work out for Lawrenson's relationship after the termination? \"There was a period when things did feel a bit awkward, but it wasn't what spoiled things in the end. In fact, having the abortion allowed it to run its course, and carry on at the pace we wanted. It ended later, but for other reasons.\" However, ultimately, the question of rights is indivisible. In Furedi's words: \"If it comes to the crunch, the decision has to be between a woman and her doctor. No one else.\"",

On a global basis, the Asia Pacific region accounted for the largest percentage gain in overall rev enues of $10.3bn, with growth of more than 20%. </p> <p>Mr Watmore said that after a first-quarter lull, following the millennium computer bug scare, the firm enjoyed strong growth in business related to the digital economy last year. </p> <p>This included IT outsourcing deals from blue-chip companies such as Sainsbury, which demonstrated the breadth of Accenture's exposure to the hi-tech economy, and the signing of alliances with Microsoft and BT. </p> <p>\"We always try to do business across a diverse range of businesses, including the more recession-proof industries as well as the more rollercoaster industries,\" he said. </p> <p>\"[Hi-tech] stock prices have obviously fallen massively yet there are still many respectable business out there like Nokia - demand for handsets is still massively up, just not as massively up as they were. These companies are still growing and need information support services.\" </p> <p>Accenture started a rebranding exercise at the beginning of this year including TV and newspaper advertising and sports sponsorship to ingrain the company's new name, adopted after the high-profile divorce from Arthur Andersen, in the public mind. </p> <p>It is now seeking to reinvent itself as the \"market-maker, architect and builder of the new economy\". </p> <p>With more than 7,000 people in 46 countries, the firm says it is building a network of businesses to meet the full range of client needs, including consulting, technology, outsourcing alliances and venture capital. </p> <p>A partial public flotation of the firm is being considered. </p> <p>Globally, the firm has five units. The products unit, which includes the company's retailing and manufacturing clients, registered the strongest growth rate in 2000, increasing its revenues by 21% to $2.1bn, followed by communications and hi-tech, which grew by 18% to $3bn. Revenues for the financial services and government units increased by 3% each, to $2.7bn and $811m. The resources unit remained unchanged at $1.7bn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Accenture, the new economy business service formerly known as Andersen Consulting, posted record UK revenues yesterday and expressed confidence despite declining hi-tech stock prices. Ian Watmore, UK managing partner of the global business, said that the bursting of the dot.com bubble had actually benefited the partnership by enabling it to continue recruiting staff in a tight labour market and to focus on solid companies with revenues which exceeded costs. \"We still see growing demand for our services across the board,\" he said. \"We are watching stock markets like everybody else, and see gloom on the other side of the Atlantic, but to date that hasn't translated into falling demand for our underlying services.\" Accenture's revenues in the UK last year were $1.13bn (\u00a3787m), an increase of 19% over 1999. On a global basis, the Asia Pacific region accounted for the largest percentage gain in overall rev enues of $10.3bn, with growth of more than 20%. Mr Watmore said that after a first-quarter lull, following the millennium computer bug scare, the firm enjoyed strong growth in business related to the digital economy last year. This included IT outsourcing deals from blue-chip companies such as Sainsbury, which demonstrated the breadth of Accenture's exposure to the hi-tech economy, and the signing of alliances with Microsoft and BT. \"We always try to do business across a diverse range of businesses, including the more recession-proof industries as well as the more rollercoaster industries,\" he said. \"[Hi-tech] stock prices have obviously fallen massively yet there are still many respectable business out there like Nokia - demand for handsets is still massively up, just not as massively up as they were. These companies are still growing and need information support services.\" Accenture started a rebranding exercise at the beginning of this year including TV and newspaper advertising and sports sponsorship to ingrain the company's new name, adopted after the high-profile divorce from Arthur Andersen, in the public mind. It is now seeking to reinvent itself as the \"market-maker, architect and builder of the new economy\". With more than 7,000 people in 46 countries, the firm says it is building a network of businesses to meet the full range of client needs, including consulting, technology, outsourcing alliances and venture capital. A partial public flotation of the firm is being considered. Globally, the firm has five units. The products unit, which includes the company's retailing and manufacturing clients, registered the strongest growth rate in 2000, increasing its revenues by 21% to $2.1bn, followed by communications and hi-tech, which grew by 18% to $3bn. Revenues for the financial services and government units increased by 3% each, to $2.7bn and $811m. The resources unit remained unchanged at $1.7bn.",

      "bodyText": "A Macedonian policeman was shot in the back and killed and a colleague was seriously wounded yesterday as they patrolled an area of Skopje largely inhabited by members of the ethnic Albanian community. Police said later they had arrested three Albanians in connection with the attack. There was no immediate confirmation that the murder was motivated by ethnic politics, but it raised fears that relations between groups in the capital, where one-fifth of the population is Albanian, could be breaking down. Since fighting broke out in recent days between state forces and Albanian insurgents in northern Macedonia, tensions in Skopje have risen. \"People are retreating into their communities and if you have friends from the other side, they look at you in a different way now,\" an Albanian journalist said. More and more Albanians were expressing support for the gunmen in the mountains, he added. Young Albanians due to be called up by Macedonia's largely conscript army were also starting to hide, fearing they might have to shoot at their own people. Although outwardly the streets of Skopje seem calm, with pavement cafes full, there is a feeling that the next few days could be decisive. The joint declaration against violence which leaders of the country's two main Albanian political parties signed on Tuesday in the presence of Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief, has not eased the tension. Many Albanian Macedonians feel the two parties have been sidelined as the government presses ahead with its offensive against the gunmen who still oc cupy a number of villages above the northern town of Tetovo. The government has wide support among the Macedonian majority of Slav descent for its strategy. Even journalists on Dnevnik, which is considered the most moderate and least nationalist of the Macedonian-language newspapers, refer to the gunmen as \"terrorists\". A senior Dnevnik editor expressed concern that Mr Solana might be trying to broker a dialogue with the gunmen, even though the Macedonian government has insisted it rejects it. \"We must get our flag up on the citadel above Tetovo, and the army has to put it there,\" the editor said. Thousands of Albanians have been fleeing the Tetovo region and other parts of Macedonia. Since last week bout 5,700 Macedonians have crossed into Turkey, a favoured destination where many have relatives, the Anatolia news agency reported yesterday. The refugees, mostly ethnic Turks and Albanians, were travelling in buses, most of them via Bulgaria, and had passports. Turkey does not require visas for Macedonians. Thousands are also fleeing Macedonia westwards into Albania proper, from where many of them travel to Kosovo. Prefabricated houses near the Bulgarian border, used to house Kosovan refugees in 1999 and Turks fleeing communist Bulgaria in 1989, were being prepared for those who did not have a place to stay, officials said. Aid agencies have said that several thousand members of Macedonia's majority have also fled to Albania, Bulgaria and Kosovo to escape the turmoil in their country. During the 1999 Kosovo conflict, Turkey took some 20,000 Kosovan refugees. What's going on? The fighting in Macedonia explained Talk about it Should Nato intervene?

In another attempt to apply pressure on the Albanian extremists, the UN war crimes prosecutor for former Yugoslavia, Carla del Ponte, disclosed that she was investigating allegations against Albanian armed groups in Kosovo and the self-styled Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac (UCPMB), which wants to take control of a part of southern Serbia. It is the first time the court has acted against Albanians suspected of perpetrating violent incidents since Nato forces entered Kosovo in June 1999. Mrs Del Ponte announced her decision after talks with Yugoslav and Serbian justice ministers. The US and Britain said they were supplying the hard-pressed Macedonian forces with advice and intelligence. Unmanned American and German reconnaissance aircraft will soon be joined by similar French drones. Macedonian officials said that information from the drones and other sources was helping the country prepare an offensive to force the rebels out of half a dozen villages in northern Macedonia where they receive food and other support from fellow ethnic Albanians But further signs of a deepening difference of approach in the US and Europen responses to the insurgency in northern Macedonia emerged last night: the Pentagon said it would not send more troops, while Britain's defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said Britain would consider any Macedonian request for military support. The difference was evident at a Pentagon press conference given by Mr Hoon and the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, which underscored the more cautious approach to the Balkans being adopted by George Bush's administration. \"We have no plans to send troops to Macedonia,\" Mr Rumsfeld told reporters. \"The answer to your question is no.\" Five thousand US troops are based in eastern Kosovo, some of whom have now been deployed along the border with Macedonia.

It was reported yesterday that German K-For peacekeepers were involved in a gun battle on the Kosovo-Macedonia border, the troops opening fire after trying to question a group of gunrunners. There were no reports of casualties. The German troops seized a consignment of weapons but the smugglers fled in the darkness, a defence ministry spokesman said.

The troops seized two AK-47 rifles, three machine guns, three bolt-action rifles, a sniper rifle, four anti-personnel mines, a rocket-propelled grenade, 12 mortar bombs, and a quantity of ammunition. \"Ultimately,\" Lord Robertson said in a statement, \"the solution to problems in the area can only be found through political means.\" The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said yesterday that the west's tolerance of ethnic Albanian rebels had helped encourage the conflict in Macedonia. \"Passive reaction by the west to the spread of the Kosovo conflict to the Albanian-populated regions [of Macedonia] ... only helps the separatists go unpunished and be more radical in their actions,\" Mr Ivanov said in the Macedonian capital, Skopje. Tomorrow he goes on to meet EU foreign ministers at their Stockholm summit. What's going on? The fighting in Macedonia explained Talk about it Should Nato intervene?

He's playing a good hand, exploiting the government's inflexible haste without looking as though he's running scared. Plainly Mr Blair is about to switch the argument. Having said for three weeks that a May 3 election can happen because foot and mouth is under control, party managers are getting ready to say the opposite: that the election must happen now because the plague may not be any better under control in September. Delay now and you delay for ever, they've begun to murmur. There's a lot of disingenuous electoralism here, which Hague would be negligent if he did not challenge.</p> <p>But it's not the biggest electoral issue inside the Conservative party. That place belongs to Europe. Europe, in fact, looms into focus all round. For the government, today's EU summit in Stockholm is one of many well carpentered planks in the bridge to May 3. Among the Tory high command, meanwhile, there are rumblings of anxiety about whether the issue will play as they have planned. For the country as a whole, the role of the election as prelude to a euro referendum deserves to be better understood.</p> <p>Mr Hague has always seen Europe as big. Along with crime, asylum and tax, it's one of the four issues he thinks he can make sing. But some of his colleagues are no longer so sure. The so-called liberalising tendency in the party, adherents of Michael Portillo and/or Francis Maude, give voice to other thoughts. These people may be only marginally less Euro-sceptic than Hague is, but they're more sceptical about the impact of Europe on voting, and much more worried about the impact of another Labour landslide on the battle they really care about, the referendum.</p> <p>The election, they know, is lost. But the referendum is not. Yet an election perceived to have been lost after a campaign that majored on Europe would send a calamitous signal. Unlike other Eurosceptics, Tory anti- Europeans do not have a strategy directed at preventing the referendum taking place by persuading Blair he can never win it. Hague's putative successors, if not Hague himself, are banking everything on the referendum as midwife to the rebirth of their party. But they face an election that threatens to pulverise their credibility. Another Labour landslide would make a referendum not merely likely but, I believe, politically very hard for the government to duck away from. If Hague has been smashed on Europe, it would also be decidedly easier to win.</p> <p>These senior colleagues, rivals awaiting their moment, have another doubt. They aren't recognisable as belonging to something called the Tory left, so they weren't fastidiously much offended by Hague's nationalistic garbage on the subject of Britain becoming \"a foreign land\". But many top Tories were taken aback by how badly that keynote speech went down, even with the Sun. Nationalistic crudity, the only way Hague knows how to talk about Europe, turned out not to appeal even to an icon of nationalism. A clash is therefore developing between Hagueites still determined to play Europe big and hard, and others who would now prefer to let the election be lost on different things.</p> <p>This has repercussions for Labour, who are assuming Hague will continue to do his piece. Mr Blair and Robin Cook anticipate the argument with relish. They see it as meat for their contention that the Tories are simply incompetent. The wilder Hague lines give them many ways of showing that this inadequate parvenu shouldn't be trusted.</p> <p>Stockholm, they intend, will add to the unfavourable comparison with themselves. It will be flourished as proof of constructive engagement. It looks as though France, for Mr Jospin's own electoral reasons, won't allow Stockholm to be a Blairite triumph, with full-scale opening up of gas and electricity markets. But there will be enough to make the British case. The financial markets will like another dose of liberal reform, building on last year's Lisbon summit. The relentless ratcheting from one obscure EU meeting to another, which is usually the obsession only of anoraked aficionados, will be presented by the Blair machine, with justice, as progress in the right direction.

But with an election coming, there are few limits to the sparkle that inventive propagandists will be able to bestow on the driest material.</p> <p>If Hague chooses to make the frontal anti-EU case, all this will be a telling riposte. It can be used to distinguish the men of business from the man of Euro-madness. But that is not the only prospect on offer. If Portilloism gets its way, and Europe recedes from the Tory agenda, the challenge to Mr Blair becomes trickier. How will he use the issue of Europe in an active not reactive way? How far will he voluntarily go to make this election, in part, a quest for a mandate to hold the referendum and win it?</p> <p>The easy answer is to say: no distance at all. Safety-first politics still dominates most Labour thinking, however luscious the majority the opinion polls seem to foretell. There's hardly a single Labour politician who can persuade him or herself that pushing Europe up front would win extra seats. An unnoticed lacuna in politics, indeed, is the absence of knowledge, let alone enthusiasm, concerning Europe of most Labour MPs. The place is a great black hole, which may not engage their active hostility but would find them at a loss in a gloves-off debate with the many sharp Tory Eurosceptics whose obsession has equipped them with formidable, if selective, expertise.

Irrespective of how far Mr Hague chooses to jump towards the unacceptable extreme, Mr Blair has his own unique chance to define his victory as a victory, among other things, for his Europe policy, and thereby advance the referendum further into the realm of practical politics.</p> <p>I have no doubt he wants to hold the referendum. Most people underestimate his personal commitment to resolving the misbegotten turmoil the Europe question has brought to modern British history. That's not to say he definitely intends to take the plunge. The gamble could look too great. But the election offers a massive opening to change the terms of trade and remake the odds. If the result is big, it needs to look like a signal for the next and bigger contest. The framework of the campaign is therefore vital. If Hague fails to oblige by offering an open target, let's hope Tony Blair doesn't shrink from inventing his own resonant language for popular endorsement.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 You left us investigating the disappearance of Sin Simon, the New Labour apologist whose column in Monday's Telegraph was so maddeningly absent. The sighting of Sin in Birmingham Erdington was, it turns out, genuine, with a beady-eyed turncoat twitcher spying him knocking on the doors of constituency party faithful this weekend.</p> <p>But what brings Mr Tony's media lackey home to the city that spawned him? A sudden stab of nostalgia for grass roots opinion, or a quite spectacular piece of electoral manoeuvring by Millbank? We are a little clearer on this after Friday's last-minute announcement by current MP Robin Corbett that he would be standing down at the election. And we are clearer still when we discover that Sin is counting on the backing of lovable general secretary Margaret McDonagh, despite strong local support for fellow shortlister Andrew Hood.</p> <p>Ah, it fair takes you back to 1997, when Millbank parachuted on message candidates into \"unexpected\" vacancies up and down the land. Why, not so long ago Sin himself dragged his carpet-bag to south Wales, only to pull out of the race at the eleventh hour. We ring him to reminisce and discuss his future, but he is too busy to talk. Still, plenty of time.</p> <p>\u0095 Much has been made of Camden's council tax rate which averages an unashamed \u00a31,000. But where else can one lurch from the bitter pain of opening one's dreaded bill to the unadulterated joy of discovering that a complimentary fold-out year-planner has been included? It may not be laminated, it may not be free from adverts for funeral parlours, but by golly it's a start on the long road to reconciliation with residents.</p> <p>\u0095 Negotiations with website supremo Oofy Wegg-Prosser over our imminent web debut appear to have hit a wall, with the missing photograph of Diary pundit Steptoe threatening to bring down the whole deal. With Matthew Norman off radar I am unable to find a picture of our affable tipster, and Oofy's patience is tried. After various stalled discussions and some deep breaths, he asks, \"What sort of dog is Steptoe?\" Whatever you are thinking, Oofy, unthink it. Steptoe has been maligned enough by Andrew Neil without having to endure the indignity of faked internet pictures. \"I'd just like to know the brand of dog,\" he continues evenly. I'm sorry, I can't. Matthew would never forgive me. The web must wait.</p> <p>\u0095 Like a benevolent Godzilla, Diary vicar Steve Chalke surfaces from a period of silent reflection to send us a book about his Faithworks organisation.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 You left us investigating the disappearance of Sin Simon, the New Labour apologist whose column in Monday's Telegraph was so maddeningly absent. The sighting of Sin in Birmingham Erdington was, it turns out, genuine, with a beady-eyed turncoat twitcher spying him knocking on the doors of constituency party faithful this weekend. But what brings Mr Tony's media lackey home to the city that spawned him? A sudden stab of nostalgia for grass roots opinion, or a quite spectacular piece of electoral manoeuvring by Millbank? We are a little clearer on this after Friday's last-minute announcement by current MP Robin Corbett that he would be standing down at the election. And we are clearer still when we discover that Sin is counting on the backing of lovable general secretary Margaret McDonagh, despite strong local support for fellow shortlister Andrew Hood. Ah, it fair takes you back to 1997, when Millbank parachuted on message candidates into \"unexpected\" vacancies up and down the land. Why, not so long ago Sin himself dragged his carpet-bag to south Wales, only to pull out of the race at the eleventh hour. We ring him to reminisce and discuss his future, but he is too busy to talk. Still, plenty of time. \u0095 Much has been made of Camden's council tax rate which averages an unashamed \u00a31,000. But where else can one lurch from the bitter pain of opening one's dreaded bill to the unadulterated joy of discovering that a complimentary fold-out year-planner has been included? It may not be laminated, it may not be free from adverts for funeral parlours, but by golly it's a start on the long road to reconciliation with residents. \u0095 Negotiations with website supremo Oofy Wegg-Prosser over our imminent web debut appear to have hit a wall, with the missing photograph of Diary pundit Steptoe threatening to bring down the whole deal. With Matthew Norman off radar I am unable to find a picture of our affable tipster, and Oofy's patience is tried. After various stalled discussions and some deep breaths, he asks, \"What sort of dog is Steptoe?\" Whatever you are thinking, Oofy, unthink it. Steptoe has been maligned enough by Andrew Neil without having to endure the indignity of faked internet pictures. \"I'd just like to know the brand of dog,\" he continues evenly. I'm sorry, I can't. Matthew would never forgive me. The web must wait. \u0095 Like a benevolent Godzilla, Diary vicar Steve Chalke surfaces from a period of silent reflection to send us a book about his Faithworks organisation. When last we spoke, having steered shy of mentioning he ran Faithworks when he chaired a debate on it on his GMTV show, Steve was kind enough to provide us with a sermon on conflict of interest. Something about looking to the mote in your own eye, but we'll move on.

Meanwhile those with the stomach for it can expect something of a special tomorrow from the UK Press Gazette awards, the traditionally unedifying gathering of the journalistic community. \u0095 2am breaking news: it's too upsetting to go into in full, but the Diary is being held to ransom over its own domain name.

      "byline": "Richard Adams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Of mice and men</strong> </p> <p>XTL is an Israeli-based biotech company which recently floated (at the second attempt) in London. Its main business involves irradiating mice to destroy their immune system, then implanting human tissue so that drugs can be tested. Although nuking mice is its main business, the company's annual results this week managed to avoid any mention of the furry wee critters. When we approached him on the subject, chief executive Martin Becker was a touch evasive when asked how many mice he had. \"A minimal number.\" Mmm, but how many? \"I simply don't have those figures to hand.\" Are we talking thousands here, or tens of thousands? \"I don't go round counting mice. We are trying to minimise our use of mice.\" Minimise? \"I'm not prepared to comment on this,\" replied Martin, his temper starting to fray. \"We would rather not use animals at all. I have not met a scientist who enjoys working with experimental animals. You are trying to sensationalise this.\" Certainly not. If we were trying to sensationalise this we'd call you a serial mouse-murderer. </p> <p>\u0095 Good news for Argentina's economic revival. Its recovery plan is being backed by the region's International Monetary Fund director, Mr Loser. </p> <p>\u0095 A new turn of events in the desperate attempt by bulge bracket bankers Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to muscle into the credit for working on a merger between two Swedish finance houses - to the chagrin of JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, who did most of the work on the deal. Now comes news that Securities Data Corporation has removed Morgan Stanley's name from the deal on the all-important merger league tables, after its rivals complained and Morgan Stanley were unable to produce an engagement letter to prove its involvement. </p> <p>\u0095 The 20,000 anti-globalisation demonstrators in Naples last Sunday must have reminded the World Trade Organisation why it is holding its next big meeting in the fantastically repressive Gulf state of Qatar. But should any protesters make it past the heavy security come November, the UK government has made its own contribution to protecting the WTO. According to Robin Cook's strategic export controls report, over the past couple of years the Labour government has helped the global economy by ethically licensing exports of anti-riot guns, assault rifles, crowd control ammunition, CS gas grenades, shotguns and smoke grenades to Qatar. </p> <p>\u0095 Who let the dogs out? It's the latest Dog of the Day entry, the award for predictions that make its author look like a pedigree chump. \"America's Federal Reserve Board is set to cut interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 4.75% this week,\" wrote David Smith (the Sunday Times' economics editor) on Sunday. No room for doubt there. So I'm sure David must have been as surprised as his readers when the Fed only cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday. Bow-wow. </p> <p>\u0095 The theft of Enrico Cuccia's body from his grave proves Italy's most influential banker is just as controversial in death as in life. Until he died last year aged 92, Cuccia dominated Italy's private sector with a web of cross-company holdings. He waged epic battles against rival financiers, including Michele Sindona, who threatened a Mafia death sentence on Cuccia unless he was bailed out with a big loan. Cuccia refused, and it was Sindona who died in prison. \"What Cuccia wants, God wants,\" Leopoldo Pirelli of the tyre making family observed. Now a message has been received, claiming to be from a ruined investor who will return Cuccia's remains if Italy's stock market goes back up to last year's levels. But an alternative explanation is more popular in Milan: that the old devil never died in the first place. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:richard.adams@theguardian.com\">richard.adams@theguardian.com</a></p>",

We are trying to minimise our use of mice.\" Minimise? \"I'm not prepared to comment on this,\" replied Martin, his temper starting to fray. \"We would rather not use animals at all. I have not met a scientist who enjoys working with experimental animals. You are trying to sensationalise this.\" Certainly not. If we were trying to sensationalise this we'd call you a serial mouse-murderer. \u0095 Good news for Argentina's economic revival. Its recovery plan is being backed by the region's International Monetary Fund director, Mr Loser. \u0095 A new turn of events in the desperate attempt by bulge bracket bankers Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to muscle into the credit for working on a merger between two Swedish finance houses - to the chagrin of JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, who did most of the work on the deal. Now comes news that Securities Data Corporation has removed Morgan Stanley's name from the deal on the all-important merger league tables, after its rivals complained and Morgan Stanley were unable to produce an engagement letter to prove its involvement. \u0095 The 20,000 anti-globalisation demonstrators in Naples last Sunday must have reminded the World Trade Organisation why it is holding its next big meeting in the fantastically repressive Gulf state of Qatar. But should any protesters make it past the heavy security come November, the UK government has made its own contribution to protecting the WTO. According to Robin Cook's strategic export controls report, over the past couple of years the Labour government has helped the global economy by ethically licensing exports of anti-riot guns, assault rifles, crowd control ammunition, CS gas grenades, shotguns and smoke grenades to Qatar. \u0095 Who let the dogs out? It's the latest Dog of the Day entry, the award for predictions that make its author look like a pedigree chump. \"America's Federal Reserve Board is set to cut interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 4.75% this week,\" wrote David Smith (the Sunday Times' economics editor) on Sunday. No room for doubt there. So I'm sure David must have been as surprised as his readers when the Fed only cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday. Bow-wow. \u0095 The theft of Enrico Cuccia's body from his grave proves Italy's most influential banker is just as controversial in death as in life. Until he died last year aged 92, Cuccia dominated Italy's private sector with a web of cross-company holdings. He waged epic battles against rival financiers, including Michele Sindona, who threatened a Mafia death sentence on Cuccia unless he was bailed out with a big loan. Cuccia refused, and it was Sindona who died in prison. \"What Cuccia wants, God wants,\" Leopoldo Pirelli of the tyre making family observed. Now a message has been received, claiming to be from a ruined investor who will return Cuccia's remains if Italy's stock market goes back up to last year's levels. But an alternative explanation is more popular in Milan: that the old devil never died in the first place. richard.adams@theguardian.com",

Ninety Britons have died of the disease since March 1995, seven more have been diagnosed with it. Experts are reluctant to predict the eventual toll.</p> <p>A catastrophic combination of factors in the early and mid-80s - including the use of older dairy cattle for beef, traditional slaughtering techniques used in smaller abattoirs and the sale of such meat to high street butchers rather than supermarkets - was blamed for a cluster of deaths linked to the village of Queniborough between Autumn 1998 and last September.</p> <p>While doctors yesterday tried to reassure local people that the likelihood of others falling victim to the disease was small, national experts were worried that the Leicestershire victims seemed to have contracted the disease years before BSE was finally identified in 1986 - a decade before the epidemic was at its height in 1992-93 and well before measures designed to protect the public from the risk of infection were in place.</p> <p>Dr Philip Monk, consultant for communicable diseases for Leicestershire health authority, and his colleague Dr Gerry Bryant outlined a number of key elements to their theory at a meeting in Queniborough.</p> <p>The beef involved came from locally reared cattle and be cause they were a by-product of dairy herds, they were fed meat and bonemeal, derived from cattle and sheep remains, to fatten them up. This is regarded as a key factor in spreading BSE through the national herd.</p> <p>Traditional slaughtering methods used in small abattoirs were also to blame, the doctors said. The messy splitting of cattle heads to remove the brains could have cross-contaminated other meat.</p> <p>Four out of the five victims may have been exposed to beef from a butcher's shop where meat could be contaminated with brain tissue.</p> <p>They did not name the butchers but in one case exposure had taken place before December 1982. The doctors also said that just one infected cow may have been responsible for infecting at least three of the victims.</p> <p>The other butcher thought to be involved ceased trading in 1989. This suggests incubation periods of between 10 and 16 years. Other studies have suggested the range may be between four and 40 years.</p> <p>Dr Bryant said: \"No one was doing anything illegal. These were totally legitimate practices before BSE was realised.\"</p> <p>Professor Robert Will, head of the national CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh welcomed the report last night but added: \"It worries me; if there was transmission to the human population when BSE was extremely rare then the question is, are we going to see a lot more from when there were much higher levels of exposure?\"</p> <p>He still believes the use of mechanically recovered meat, machined off the spinal cord to be used in cheap food and not banned until 1995, may still be a factor.</p> <p>Other investigations are already under way to test apparent links between victims in Stockport, Lancashire and Doncaster. There may also be linked cases in six other areas - Stockton-on-Tees; south Wales; Chester-le-Street, Durham; Walton-on-Thames, Surrey; Eastleigh, Hampshire and Strathclyde, Scotland.</p> <p>The Department of Health welcomed the report but pointed out that the use of brains and other offals had been banned from food in 1989.</p> <p>However, Harriet Kimbell, consumer representative on the government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee which supervises both BSE and vCJD issues, said vigilance was still needed as spinal cord had been found in imported carcasses from Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland recently.</p> <p><b>Victims</b><br> Links between the five who died</p> <p><b> \u0095 Stacey Robinson </b></p> <p>A 19-year-old single mother who had lived in Queniborough but moved away just before her death, she was the first to die in August 1998. She was initially diagnosed as suffering from post-natal depression.</p> <p><b> \u0095 Pamela Beyless</b></p> <p>Pamela Beyless, a bank worker, lived four miles from Queniborough but visited her grandparents, who live there. She first fell ill in March 1996 and after a two-year decline, died in October 1998, aged 24.</p> <p><b>\u0095 Christopher Reeve</b></p> <p>The 24-year-old farm worker died last October, less than a year after first displaying symptoms. He lived in Rearsby but worked in nearby Queniborough. He was a friend of Stacey Robinson's brother.</p> <p><b> \u0095 Glen Day</b></p> <p>The 35-year-old van driver lived with his parents in the village. He died within weeks of Pamela Beyless, whose grandparents were neighbours. He may also have worked alongside Christopher Reeve. The village historian, Rosemary Smith, described him as a \"kind and loving chap\".</p> <p><b>\u0095 The unnamed victim</b></p> <p>The 19-year-old man, who had links with the Queniborough, area, died in May last year. He is thought to have lived within three miles of the village. His family have requested that he not be identified.</p> <p><b>Process</b><br></p> <p>The inquiry focused on how some local butchers used to process carcasses, often using traditional techniques that were centuries old.</p> <p>Butchers removed the brain from the beast - which was legal at the time - as they recovered meat from the head. The carcass was then boned and jointed. This meant that other meat could become contaminated by potentially infectious brain material.</p> <p>The inquiry also looked at techniques used at abattoirs. Cattle were slaughtered using a \"captive bolt stunner\", which drives a bolt into the animal's head.

      "bodyText": "The government is to order new checks on farming methods, food preparation and the eating and buying habits of consumers in the 80s, after new evidence that shows they all played a part in mixing the lethal cocktail that developed into new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) - the human form of BSE. Scientific advisers are to review the results of an eight-month investigation into the deaths of five people from vCJD in a small area of Leicestershire to see if it can explain the rapidly mounting death toll. Ninety Britons have died of the disease since March 1995, seven more have been diagnosed with it. Experts are reluctant to predict the eventual toll. A catastrophic combination of factors in the early and mid-80s - including the use of older dairy cattle for beef, traditional slaughtering techniques used in smaller abattoirs and the sale of such meat to high street butchers rather than supermarkets - was blamed for a cluster of deaths linked to the village of Queniborough between Autumn 1998 and last September. While doctors yesterday tried to reassure local people that the likelihood of others falling victim to the disease was small, national experts were worried that the Leicestershire victims seemed to have contracted the disease years before BSE was finally identified in 1986 - a decade before the epidemic was at its height in 1992-93 and well before measures designed to protect the public from the risk of infection were in place. Dr Philip Monk, consultant for communicable diseases for Leicestershire health authority, and his colleague Dr Gerry Bryant outlined a number of key elements to their theory at a meeting in Queniborough. The beef involved came from locally reared cattle and be cause they were a by-product of dairy herds, they were fed meat and bonemeal, derived from cattle and sheep remains, to fatten them up. This is regarded as a key factor in spreading BSE through the national herd. Traditional slaughtering methods used in small abattoirs were also to blame, the doctors said. The messy splitting of cattle heads to remove the brains could have cross-contaminated other meat. Four out of the five victims may have been exposed to beef from a butcher's shop where meat could be contaminated with brain tissue. They did not name the butchers but in one case exposure had taken place before December 1982. The doctors also said that just one infected cow may have been responsible for infecting at least three of the victims. The other butcher thought to be involved ceased trading in 1989. This suggests incubation periods of between 10 and 16 years. Other studies have suggested the range may be between four and 40 years. Dr Bryant said: \"No one was doing anything illegal. These were totally legitimate practices before BSE was realised.\" Professor Robert Will, head of the national CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh welcomed the report last night but added: \"It worries me; if there was transmission to the human population when BSE was extremely rare then the question is, are we going to see a lot more from when there were much higher levels of exposure?\" He still believes the use of mechanically recovered meat, machined off the spinal cord to be used in cheap food and not banned until 1995, may still be a factor. Other investigations are already under way to test apparent links between victims in Stockport, Lancashire and Doncaster. There may also be linked cases in six other areas - Stockton-on-Tees; south Wales; Chester-le-Street, Durham; Walton-on-Thames, Surrey; Eastleigh, Hampshire and Strathclyde, Scotland. The Department of Health welcomed the report but pointed out that the use of brains and other offals had been banned from food in 1989. However, Harriet Kimbell, consumer representative on the government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee which supervises both BSE and vCJD issues, said vigilance was still needed as spinal cord had been found in imported carcasses from Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland recently. Victims Links between the five who died \u0095 Stacey Robinson A 19-year-old single mother who had lived in Queniborough but moved away just before her death, she was the first to die in August 1998. She was initially diagnosed as suffering from post-natal depression. \u0095 Pamela Beyless Pamela Beyless, a bank worker, lived four miles from Queniborough but visited her grandparents, who live there. She first fell ill in March 1996 and after a two-year decline, died in October 1998, aged 24. \u0095 Christopher Reeve The 24-year-old farm worker died last October, less than a year after first displaying symptoms. He lived in Rearsby but worked in nearby Queniborough. He was a friend of Stacey Robinson's brother. \u0095 Glen Day The 35-year-old van driver lived with his parents in the village. He died within weeks of Pamela Beyless, whose grandparents were neighbours. He may also have worked alongside Christopher Reeve. The village historian, Rosemary Smith, described him as a \"kind and loving chap\". \u0095 The unnamed victim The 19-year-old man, who had links with the Queniborough, area, died in May last year. He is thought to have lived within three miles of the village. His family have requested that he not be identified. Process The inquiry focused on how some local butchers used to process carcasses, often using traditional techniques that were centuries old. Butchers removed the brain from the beast - which was legal at the time - as they recovered meat from the head. The carcass was then boned and jointed. This meant that other meat could become contaminated by potentially infectious brain material. The inquiry also looked at techniques used at abattoirs. Cattle were slaughtered using a \"captive bolt stunner\", which drives a bolt into the animal's head. Many abattoirs also used a pithing rod - a rod inserted through the hole made by the stunner, which can prevent the animal kicking reflexively. Even before yesterday's report, fears had been raised that pithing could spread BSE-infected tissue. Last year, the EU said the technique should not be used. Larger abattoirs tended to hose the carcass but smaller ones would only wipe it down to remove unwanted tissue, raising the risk of cross-contamination of meat with brain and nerve tissue. In the early 80s there was no legal requirement to hose down a carcass; indeed some slaughtermen believed that it made the meat go \"sour\".

The village was deserted, the local butcher's shop shut and the two pubs had long called last orders on lunch. There was no hint yesterday that this was the centre of a nine-month hunt for the killer that had claimed five people living within a few miles between autumn 1998 and autumn 2000.</p> <p>For more than two years, residents had worried that they had been cruelly picked out to suffer more than other parts of Britain from the human form of BSE.</p> <p>Queniborough, population 2,300, is not a particularly pretty village, the 17th century thatched cottages rubbing shoulders with nondescript housing on a main road.</p> <p>But the people who live here and within a five-kilometre radius in the Wreake and Foar Valley hope they may have helped unlock some secrets of the harrowing disease that has claimed more than 100 victims.</p> <p>It was difficult to tell what people dreaded most when they arrived yesterday morning for a public meeting of the Leicestershire health authority at Syston rugby club half a mile from the village.</p> <p>It may have been the suggestion that more people might yet die from the fatal condition that can strike at least 10 years after infection or, for some, it was the nightmare of having to relive their experiences.</p> <p>They listened quietly as doctors explained their hypothesis that a catastrophic combination of farming methods, traditional and sometimes messy slaughtering and butchery techniques and people's own eating habits had exposed local people to the prospect of a dreadful death.</p> <p>The present butcher, David Clarke, has been in the village since the early 1980s but it was from his predecessor that at least one local family, who saw their daughter slide towards an awful death, had bought their meat.</p> <p>Mr Clarke, said: \"It is terrible what has happened but it is not only in this area. It is in other parts of Britain. Awful.</p> <p>\"You can't blame anyone, butchers were using methods that were traditional, that everyone used. No one had ever heard of BSE; no one knew there was any danger.</p> <p>\"When I started there was food rationing. You needed all the food you could get; the head was regarded as a bonus. No one knew of the dangers of spinal cord and so on.\"</p> <p>Arthur Beyless, whose daughter, Pamela, died in October 1998 aged 24, told yesterday how the family had travelled miles from their home on the outskirts of Leicester to pick up frozen meat from the Queniborough butcher's because his wife's parents lived in the village and recommended the shop, then run by a butcher called Ian Bramley.</p> <p>Mr Beyless said: \"I don't believe he would have knowingly chosen anything he could not eat himself. We bought in bulk, it was not just that we bought the odd joint.\"</p> <p>The family had given up eating beef during Pamela's illness. But Mr Beyless, 54, a milkman, said he was still worried for his wife Jane and his sons, Steven, 31, and David, 29.</p> <p>Rosemary Smith, daughter of another former butcher in the village, told how she used to deliver meat to Mr Beyless. \"Butchers' practice in this area would be no different to anywhere else in the country or in the world. If people wanted brains they could have brains.\"</p> <p>Many locals were not completely reassured by the report and still think other causes may be responsible for helping spread BSE and vCJD. Ms Smith suggested manganese in the soil. \"I think more research should be done, we should not shut the door.\"</p> <p>Robert Pendleton, 74, suggested the use of chemicals to fight the warble fly that attacked cattle could be to blame. \"In our day, we had organic food and that is where it needs to go back to.\"</p> <p>Teenager Anja Gooding said: \"I am not reassured.

      "bodyText": "It was half-day closing in Queniborough, a few minutes drive out of Leicester. The village was deserted, the local butcher's shop shut and the two pubs had long called last orders on lunch. There was no hint yesterday that this was the centre of a nine-month hunt for the killer that had claimed five people living within a few miles between autumn 1998 and autumn 2000. For more than two years, residents had worried that they had been cruelly picked out to suffer more than other parts of Britain from the human form of BSE. Queniborough, population 2,300, is not a particularly pretty village, the 17th century thatched cottages rubbing shoulders with nondescript housing on a main road. But the people who live here and within a five-kilometre radius in the Wreake and Foar Valley hope they may have helped unlock some secrets of the harrowing disease that has claimed more than 100 victims. It was difficult to tell what people dreaded most when they arrived yesterday morning for a public meeting of the Leicestershire health authority at Syston rugby club half a mile from the village. It may have been the suggestion that more people might yet die from the fatal condition that can strike at least 10 years after infection or, for some, it was the nightmare of having to relive their experiences. They listened quietly as doctors explained their hypothesis that a catastrophic combination of farming methods, traditional and sometimes messy slaughtering and butchery techniques and people's own eating habits had exposed local people to the prospect of a dreadful death. The present butcher, David Clarke, has been in the village since the early 1980s but it was from his predecessor that at least one local family, who saw their daughter slide towards an awful death, had bought their meat. Mr Clarke, said: \"It is terrible what has happened but it is not only in this area. It is in other parts of Britain. Awful. \"You can't blame anyone, butchers were using methods that were traditional, that everyone used. No one had ever heard of BSE; no one knew there was any danger. \"When I started there was food rationing. You needed all the food you could get; the head was regarded as a bonus. No one knew of the dangers of spinal cord and so on.\" Arthur Beyless, whose daughter, Pamela, died in October 1998 aged 24, told yesterday how the family had travelled miles from their home on the outskirts of Leicester to pick up frozen meat from the Queniborough butcher's because his wife's parents lived in the village and recommended the shop, then run by a butcher called Ian Bramley. Mr Beyless said: \"I don't believe he would have knowingly chosen anything he could not eat himself. We bought in bulk, it was not just that we bought the odd joint.\" The family had given up eating beef during Pamela's illness. But Mr Beyless, 54, a milkman, said he was still worried for his wife Jane and his sons, Steven, 31, and David, 29. Rosemary Smith, daughter of another former butcher in the village, told how she used to deliver meat to Mr Beyless. \"Butchers' practice in this area would be no different to anywhere else in the country or in the world. If people wanted brains they could have brains.\" Many locals were not completely reassured by the report and still think other causes may be responsible for helping spread BSE and vCJD. Ms Smith suggested manganese in the soil. \"I think more research should be done, we should not shut the door.\" Robert Pendleton, 74, suggested the use of chemicals to fight the warble fly that attacked cattle could be to blame. \"In our day, we had organic food and that is where it needs to go back to.\" Teenager Anja Gooding said: \"I am not reassured. I don't eat beef anymore anyway. People are worried, people really want to know what is happening.\" Last night more residents were going to the local primary school to hear the full story. Meanwhile, Stephen Dorrell, the constituency MP, admitted that there was an irony in that he had been the health secretary who had to announce the probable link between BSE and vCJD in the Commons on March 20 five years ago. He said: \"This explanation does not break radical new ground and that is good news. It reinforces the emerging picture from work all over the country.\" Related stories 21.03.2001: Food preparation may be crucial clue to CJD deaths 10.03.2001: Link 'discovered' between cluster of five CJD deaths John O'Farrell, comment: Talking bullocks 09.02.2001: Government acknowledges public's food fears 05.02.2001: CJD link to blood Britain sold abroad Talk about it What do you think?

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard smashed a gun running operation yesterday with the arrest of six people who were being questioned over an arms cache which included heavy machine guns, mortars and hand grenades. The seizure came after a chase across London and the discovery of a workshop equipped to repair and adapt an array of weaponry. Detectives believe the guns and ammunition, which were manufactured in the US and are thought to have been imported from Europe, were intended for criminal gangs which specialise in drug dealing, contract killing and armed robbery. It is not thought the seizure is terrorist related. \"The weapons were undoubtedly intended for criminals at the top of the tree, involved in professional crime,\" a detective said. Armed officers began covert surveillance on a cemetery in Benfleet, Essex, on Tuesday afternoon, following an investigation by the Metropolitan police serious and organised crime command. Two men were arrested as one allegedly tried to sell the other a machine gun for cash. Two accomplices who were watching from a Mercedes sped off when officers pounced. They were followed and arrested after a chase across east London that ended when they were surrounded in Bethnal Green. On Tuesday evening, armed officers raided a house in Woodford Green, Essex, recovering four heavy machine guns, a MP40 machine pistol, numerous hand grenades, ammunition, high explosive and mortars. Officers then went to another address in Essex, where they found a workshop for repairing and adapting firearms. Six men were being questioned at different police stations in Essex and east London last night. \"This was an intelligence-led operation targeting individuals who we believe are involved in the trafficking of heavy weaponry in London,\" said Detective Chief Superintendent John Coles, who is in charge of the investigation. \"We believe we have recovered weapons, ammunition and explosives, which were intended to be sold to criminals who would use it in the commission of armed robberies, contract killings and drug related shootings.\" Police believe drug gangs were likely customers, and will investigate whether the suppliers were linked to Yardie criminals in London. The Met revealed in January that a network of unlicensed gun dealers had been linked to almost all the Yardie style killings which have blighted inner city areas in London, the West Midlands and Manchester, in recent years.",

Captain Douglas Henderson, master of the Bowbelle at the time of the disaster in August 1989 on the Thames, could have been stripped of his master's certificate as a result of the public inquiry. But the report on the tragedy is expected to draw back from making this recommendation. Mr Henderson was tried in 1991 on a charge of failing to keep a proper lookout. The jury failed to reach a verdict, as did another jury at a second trial and he was acquitted. He is understood to be currently serving as a mate on a non-British vessel in north European waters. Mr Henderson was one of a number of witnesses who gave evidence to Lord Justice Clarke's inquiry which was held at the end of last year following a 10-year campaign for a full investigation by survivors and relatives of those who died in the disaster. The inquiry, expected to cost \u00a36m, will finally establish the circumstances of the collision, including its exact location and the system of lookouts on both ships. Steps have already been taken to improve safety on the Thames with the coastguard taking over search and rescue responsibilities on the river from next year. Lifeboats will also be stationed on the Thames for the first time from next January, when the Royal National Lifeboat Institution will establish three stations, at Gravesend, Tower Pier and Chiswick. The river is busy with passenger traffic, with the government encouraging use of the water as an alternative to London's jammed roads, but \"juggernaut\" dredgers like the Bowbelle are no longer on the Thames.

The head of the government's children and young people's unit says she wants to listen more to young people. Indeed, she wants us all to. She wants nothing less than a cultural, societal shift.</p> <p>The unit, she says, is \"trying to change a culture of institutions, of government of local organisations\". She wants \"to change a culture in society, where the voice of young people is a valued voice and we are developing as citizens from an early age, so that they actually feel that they have a stake in society.\" </p> <p>This, says Ms Efunshile, at one point, is her vision - although actually it is one of several for her and the unit set up last year. Her \"vision for the service and what it might lead to is more joined-up services on the ground\" because \"that's where children fall between the gaps\", she explains. (You might well wonder if the New Labour mission for social renewal, inclusion and civic responsibility, has produced more visions than Joan of Arc.)</p> <p>And Ms Efunshile is, of course, onboard and on-message. But, while she's neither particularly demonstrative nor excitable, her intelligence and firm but friendly articulacy do suggest a woman who's not in the business of mouthing government platitudes because it's her job. The language may be inspirational New Labour but the commitment seems her own. </p> <p>She has, she says, \"a passion for improving the lives of children and young people\". And she cites a history of doing just that, first as a teacher and then as a youth worker who worked her way up to one of the top jobs in children's services. Before, as south-east London Lewisham council's director of education, culture and lifelong learning, she oversaw a project where \"disengaged\" young people (think truants hanging round Lewisham's unlovely shopping mall and you might begin to get the picture) were \"contacted by youth workers\". A long-term programme, that included residentials, led to \"demands on statutory agencies\", a budget and youth conference run by young people, and an anti-racism pack, which participants saw as a big priority. </p> <p>That kind of involvement - messy, unpredictable, complicated but exciting - is what she wants for the work of the unit and the local partnerships between the public, private and voluntary sectors, which will be spending the lion's share of the children's fund. \"My idea of youth participation is about getting them to make decisions,\" she says.</p> <p>This is clearly what she is hoping for from the youth advisory forum, announced today by prime minister Tony Blair and minister for young people, Paul Boateng. The forum will draw upon a group of up to 100 10- to 17-year-olds. It will be chaired by the rather older and abrasive Mr Boateng - let's hope the children are an assertive bunch - so that \"the voice of young people will be directly relayed back into government. Because Paul Boateng, as the minister for youth, sees himself as the champion of youth across government,\" explains Ms Efunshile. </p> <p>Not everyone who works with children, however, sees Mr Boateng in quite the same light. His role as minister in a Home Office dedicated to tackling Britain's \"yob culture\" has left some muttering that he would be better titled the minister for locking up young people.</p> <p>Mr Boateng, to be fair, has at least been talking up the need to pay attention to young people. \"I want to hear young people's voices across government live and clear. Our new advisory forum will, for the first time, bring children and young people to the centre of policy-making and development on decisions that directly affect their lives.\"</p> <p>How much attention ministers will pay to their junior advisers remains to be seen. But Ms Efunshile points out, not entirely unreasonably, that consultation is not the same as agreeing to do everything you're asked to do. And she is also aware that it needs to be made clear that \"boundaries\" will be set, because \"it's not fair to give young people the impression that whatever they say is going to happen will happen, because it's not mature and it's not what happens with any other group.\"</p> <p>So, apart from lessons in realpolitik, what else is promised for youths? The unit's strategy, Tomorrow's Future: Building a Strategy for Children and Young People, has been published today. It is underpinned by \"four strategic issues\", says Ms Efunshile. These are: continually improving services; coordination and leadership (including coming up with an overarching youth strategy across central government); prevention, with a focus on local needs and that old favourite, the \"bottom-up\" approach; and making sure that services are \"designed around the needs of children and young people\", rather than fitting youths to the services.</p> <p>The unit will be \"outward focused\", with some of its 35 or so employees - Ms Efunshile is looking to \"augment\" the number of staff - acting as links and development workers with the local partnerships. Part of its work will be publicising, partly via the web, \"what works best\", including good examples of how the children's fund is being used.</p> <p>She wants to promote, largely through the children's fund, \"a change, where resources are spent at the preventive stage, rather than waiting until young people are in crisis.\" And, aware of criticisms that this government is obsessed with novelty, leaving impoverished and adrift the fundamental services that underpin our welfare state, she adds: \"It isn't just about additional resources for additional whizzy projects on the ground. It's also about influencing and impacting on mainstream services, so that mainstream services themselves are rethinking and refocusing how they use their resources and the shape of their services, and how they relate to each other.\"</p> <p>The fact that the unit works across government, and that both the statutory sector and the voluntary sector have to be included in the local partnerships, should allay fears that local government is being sidelined, says Ms Efunshile. Specific concerns among social workers that Mr Boateng would boost the role of charities at the expense of social services won't be realised if she is to be believed.</p> <p>But she warns that no one should assume their place at the table. The partnerships will need a \"dialogue\" and \"a strategy for talking to young people\" in order to get their tranche of \u00a3380m over three years, says Ms Efunshile. The unit will be \"hard edged\", with a close eye kept on outcomes - including reduced crime, health inequalities and truancy and improved educational performance.</p> <p>Refreshingly, however, she is not after a quick fix. \"With some of these things, you're not going to see changes overnight. There won't be unrealistic expectations placed on partnerships, in terms of objectives and measures and targets but we do want a focus in terms of what the children's fund will be doing.\"</p> <p>And the outcomes Ms Efunshile most wants to see? Well, they are the grand visions of New Labour: improvements in the life chances of young people and the eradication of child poverty in 20 years. But she has her own personal wish and that's for \"a changed culture, where the voice of young people is actually heard and is impacting on services at both a local and a government level\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "A national network of \"safe houses\" to accommodate the thousands of young people under the age of 16 who run away from home is to be created under proposals outlined by the government. The idea is one a series of social exclusion unit initiatives aimed at stepping up provision for the 77,000 youngsters who flee family problems, bullying or drug problems each year. The government admits there is inadequate support for most runaways, who are given little help in tackling the problems which made them run away. The problems have been exacerbated by the closure of refuges for young people in Leeds, London and Cardiff - now there is just one, in central London, which provides just five places. The unit also proposes setting up teams of special advisers to counsel runaways, and drawing up a national runaways strategy to drive up standards of services across the country. Launching the report, the prime minister, Tony Blair, said better ways had to be found of tackling the issue of runaways: \"We have to make it less likely that young people run away in the first place - and if they do run, ensure their immediate safety.\" The report says although most young people who leave home do so only briefly, a quarter sleep rough and one in 14 survive through begging, drug dealing and prostitution. Ian Sparks, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: \"It means that in future years, these children will have safe alternatives to living on the streets, being put at risk of dangerous and predatory adults, or being exposed to drugs. \"This initiative opens a new era of protection for isolated, unsupported and frightened children at risk on the streets.\" Madeline Ismach, director of National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children London, said: \"We need to stress that it's also very important to work with young people to prevent them running away in the first place.\" The proposals are contained in a consultation paper, Young Runaways. Consultation finishes on 22 June.",

      "body": "<p>Modern local government began in Birmingham when the mayor and corporation bought the town gasworks and water company and used the profit from light and heat to rebuild the crumbling sewers. The mayor was Joseph Chamberlain and the corporation believed in his Civic Gospel of Improvement. For more than a hundred years, councillors of England's second city continued to act with what Chamberlain called \"sagacious audacity\" - which to them meant a continual increase in expenditure and activity. </p> <p>At the height of its powers, the City of Birmingham owned hospitals, a bus and tramway company, more houses than any other landlord in the West Midlands, and a bank. It was the statutory police authority, managed what were wrongly called state schools, paid \"relief\" to the sick and unemployed and subsidised amenities of its own choice - parks, concert halls, allotments and museums - from rates which it levied at its own discretion. Birmingham councillors were not universally loved, but they were respected as men and women of authority. </p> <p>Ever since the days of Joe Chamberlain's Liberal caucus, party politics has been an essential ingredient in Birmingham local government. Labour has been in tight control for 17 years. Now there are 67 Labour councillors, 28 Conservative and 18 Liberals. There are also five members of Justice, a group of Muslims who demand \"freedom for Kashmir\". Whatever relevance their policy has to municipal government, they reflect the ethnic pattern of the city's population. The 1991 census identified 13.5% of the population as Asian. Half were of Pakistani origin. </p> <p>It is fashionable to suggest that strict party discipline has brought the council into disrepute. Sir Richard Knowles, Labour leader for 10 years, has a different explanation: \"We have lost popularity because we have lost power.\" Whatever the reason for their disenchantment, the people of Birmingham are not enthused by municipal politics. The turnout in the last local election was 28%. The public consultation which preceded the city budget attracted audiences of five in Liberal Yardley and 20 in Tory Sutton Coldfield. </p> <p>None of the meetings produced an outcry against the abandonment of, or reduction in, the caring services. The closure of day centres provoked barely a murmur of protest. Perhaps Birmingham has accepted the view of Sir Michael Lyons, Birmingham's chief executive and once a Labour councillor: \"What the council is expected to do is just not sustainable on present resources.\" Or it may be that the people no longer expect local government to meet their real needs. </p> <p>Birmingham local government is still big business. Its annual budget is more than \u00a32bn. Some 43,000 employees crowd its payroll. But it has lost many of the powers which directly affect the lives and welfare of its citizens. Some council services were nationalised by Labour. Others were privatised by Conservatives. Both parties hedged about council powers with so many regulations that, over great areas of policy, local government became no more than an agent of Whitehall and Westminster. Ministers call the tune because they pay the piper. Birmingham raises 11% of its revenue from council tax. The Treasury provides 63%. That equation makes independence impossible. </p> <p>Education is the one remaining service which gives city councils a popular appeal. The appearance of power deceives. \"In reality,\" says Albert Bore, the council leader, \"we are no longer an education authority. We neither directly provide the service nor set the standards\". </p> <p>Professor Tim Brighouse, the chief education officer, makes the same point in less apocalyptic language. \"It is our duty to secure the provision of an education service.

Market forces were to exert their influence on councils through a system of compulsory competitive tendering which required, in effect, more and more services to be handed to private enterprise.

The solution it proposes to the escalating housing crisis is a negotiated deal with central government built on the promise to reduce the city's powers. </p> <p>Until the mid-seventies, Whitehall frantically encouraged council house building with lavish subsidies. Then the mood changed. Margaret Thatcher was not only against council house building, she was the enemy of \"the council house culture\". In the most socially significant decision of her premiership, she gave municipal tenants the \"right to buy\". Seventy five thousand Birmingham families took up the offer.

This year Birmingham received \u00a380m from the housing investment programme. Almost half will be used to subsidise private properties. \"As things now stand,\" says Mr Bore, knowing that he is stating the obvious, \"the situation gets worse not better\". His remedy - the sale of the whole housing stock - may work. Tony Blair is as opposed to council tenancy as Margaret Thatcher once was. Birmingham hopes that the government will clear its housing debt as the price of ending municipal dependency. </p> <p>A year ago, after pressure from dissatisfied tenants, 3,000 properties on the Lea Bank estate were transferred to the ownership of an independent trust.

The results of the polls are not in much doubt. The choice will lie between a pound a week rent increase linked to a programme of repair and renovation and a rent freeze which guarantees continued dilapidation. Seventy five per cent of tenants receive housing benefit. They can vote for a rent increase in the knowledge that it will be paid by the government. </p> <p>Birmingham's Labour left argues that the government should clear the debt and leave the houses in council ownership. Perhaps it should. But the only hope of the Treasury paying off the debt lies in the council abandoning its role as landlord. Mr Bore could reluctantly accept the end of municipal tenancy as inevitable. But he endorses the government's determination to move the ownership of low-cost, rented houses from corporations to independent trusts. He has \"thought very carefully\" about the merits of council tenancy and decided that it \"does not produce a proper social mix\". His socialist heresy does not end there. Mr Bore has come to the conclusion that Birmingham's direct labour department is, by its nature, uncompetitive. </p> <p>Sir Michael describes the soon-to-be privatised department as \"always too big for an in-house operation\" and \"the victim of long-term poor management\". That is only part of the story. Too often decisions have been taken in the interests of its employees rather than its customers - the people of Birmingham. Every estate echoes with unverifiable stories of petty fraud - repairs recorded as completed but not done. But the real problem is more fundamental. The public works department will lose \u00a38.5m this year, and an estimated \u00a314m next, because the council refused to accept the disciplines required for commercial survival. </p> <p>Right-to-buy legislation reduced Birmingham housing stock by almost half. So, to protect the direct labour workforce, the council increased its repair and maintenance programme to a level which was neither affordable nor sustainable.

A private builder who made such errors would have gone out of business within a year. </p> <p>So would a privately owned care home that accepted the wage levels and conditions of service which the unions have negotiated with Birmingham council. Care assistants working for the social services department are paid double time and given a day's holiday in lieu if they work on Sunday. Staff who telephone in sick on Sunday morning receive the same compensation for \"working\" unsocial hours. The corporation cannot afford, but dare not abandon, such largesse. A private company will, the theory goes, reduce labour costs in ways no council could contemplate.

Prof Brighouse is gratified by how little advantage Birmingham's headteachers have taken of the new freedom. He ought not to be surprised. The revival in the city's education system is, at least in part, the product of his six years in the city. Prof Brighouse describes his job, crushed between David Blunkett's increasingly detailed demands and the growing autonomy of individual schools, as \"looking down the wrong end of a telescope at a Swiss watch with a spanner in my hand\" - which does not suggest enthusiasm for the new regime. Labouring under that disadvantage, he has transformed Birmingham's education. </p> <p>In his last major act as council leader, Sir Richard commissioned Ted Wragg of Exeter University to head an enquiry into \"the present and future needs of education in Birmingham\". It was a courageous decision. Sir Richard knew that the council's young Turks blamed him for a reduction in the education budget to \u00a370m below the standard spending assessment, the government's estimate of what the city needed to invest in the future. The Wragg report's first recommendation was that \"the council should give education top priority and appropriate standing\". When the time came to appoint a new chief officer, Prof Brighouse seemed the right man to lead the renaissance. Education spending rose to \u00a320m above the spending assessment. Improved examination results moved the city from virtually the bottom to a third of the way up the national league tables. No one is sure which has had the greater effect - money or Prof Brighouse's quirky but dynamic personality. </p> <p>Education, once the city's neglected service, now pioneers new methods of promoting literacy and numeracy - including the University of the First Age, which offers extra teaching for 11 to 15-year-olds in conditions they find congenial rather than constraining. More important, at a time when teachers feel underpaid and undervalued, Prof Brighouse has lifted staff-room morale. His open antagonism to Chris Woodhead, the hugely disliked former chief inspector of schools, helped. So did his successful libel action against John Patten (a brief, but greatly despised, secretary of state) and the decision to donate his damages to school improvements. But it was the way in which he spent his early weeks in the job that won his spurs. He visited schools and talked to teachers. Even within its modern limitation, local government works best when it fulfils its historic destiny to be personal and intimate. </p> <p><strong>New civic gospel</strong><br> </p> <p>.Prof Brighouse has made \"partnership\" with the government work. It is a special use of the word since one of the partners dictates how the other will behave. A white paper, Modern Local Government, leaves no doubt which of the partners is in charge. \"There is no future in the old model of councils trying to plan and run most services\". Instead they will be required \"to promote the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of their areas\". Birmingham has grasped - perhaps it even anticipated - one element in that stern injunction and elevated it to a new civic gospel. The idea that the corporation should actively encourage commercial development came upon the council gradually and was accepted by some councillors reluctantly and by others not at all. </p> <p>Twenty-five years ago, in a contest which was more about prestige than prosperity, Birmingham beat London in the race to become home to the National Exhibition Centre. Its success was never in doubt. But, situated on the southern boundary, the NEC has not made much of a contribution to the city's economy. It was valued as a status symbol. At one meeting, where the triumph over London was discussed, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was offered as another example of provincial superiority. Everybody agreed that it needed a new concert hall. Nobody could think of a way to raise the money. </p> <p>Someone suggested an approach to the European Community. Initial enquiries suggested that, although the regional development fund would not invest in a concert hall, it might provide money for something bigger and better. The result was the International Convention Centre in which the development fund invested \u00a349.7m. The chamber of commerce and the local CBI thought it could be built next to, or as an extension of, the Exhibition Centre. But the council wanted it in the city centre. While Birmingham was still negotiating with Brussels, the old Victorian concert hall - not half a mile from Chamberlain Square and the town hall - burned down. The city centre was transformed. Almost a third of the council registered the Labour group complaint that Sir Richard was wasting time and money which should have been devoted to education. </p> <p>The convention centre whetted the council's appetite for commercial development. Over 15 years the EU invested another \u00a3175m on tearing the city apart and putting it back together again, as well as more than \u00a3100m in social fund programmes for neighbourhood regeneration. The National Indoor Arena was built next to the ICC. The city took a third share in a Hyatt hotel which was thought necessary to accommodate the expected flood of visitors. Since then hotel building has become a Birmingham growth industry. Few pumps have ever been primed so successfully. Brindley Place and the associated restoration of the canal basin is now a civic showpiece of shops and offices. Seven thousand new jobs have been created in the area, as many as there will be at Rover's Longbridge factory in 2002. </p> <p>The city's commitment to urban regeneration came to practical life in the spring of 1988 at a meeting between representatives of national and local government, business and the various planning professions. It was held at Highbury, once the home of the Chamberlains - a venue which was either prophetic or paradoxical depending on whether the new policy is regarded as a continuation of or a break with Birmingham's municipal tradition. From then on all plans for city generation were called \"Highbury\". The stated purpose of Highbury was \"to explore the relationship between economic activity and investment and the physical environment\". The council undertook to create the physical conditions for commercial growth in the city centre. Whether all the participants realised it or not, the civic gospel was taking on an economic dimension. </p> <p>The results have been a spectacular success for local government as \"facilitator\" rather than provider. Three potential developers - Hammersons, Henderson's and Land Securities - competed with each other for planning permission to regenerate part of the old Bull Ring. The council persuaded them to come together in a partnership which will create 8,000 new jobs. The Alliance consortium, as it is now called, is part of the massive regeneration initiative in which the city council \"brokers\" partnerships between the private and public sectors. From the old GPO sorting office, which has become a vast shopping mall, to Fort Dunlop which now advertises \"hotels, sports, eating, shops\", Birmingham's economy is changing. The 200,000 jobs which were lost between 1975 and 1985 (more than in Scotland and Wales combined) are gradually being replaced as service industries take over from manufacturing. The council - or at least its leader - is changing to accommodate the new world. </p> <p>Mr Bore's enthusiasm is instinctive. He is a technocrat by profession and, despite his leftwing past, a tycoon by temperament. Ironically, the Liberal and Conservative council leaders are beginning - despite their business backgrounds - to express fears that too much municipal time and effort is being spent on the city centre at the rest of Birmingham's expense. The Labour group has never disguised its doubts. Last May, Mr Bore was re-elected leader by a majority of one vote. The nature of the challenge that all but unseated him was confirmed by the quality of the near successful pretender. No one thought that Kevin Stacey had more ability than Mr Bore - just that he was different. </p> <p>The dissatisfaction may be diminished by the publication of A New Partnership for Governance, a consultation paper on the future of local government in Birmingham which addresses old problems in new language. The determination \"to tackle the deep seated problems of social exclusion\" are an echo of Joe Chamberlain's belief that \"an extension of the functions and authority\" of Birmingham corporation would assist in \"equalising the conditions of men\". In common with the mood of the moment, Birmingham believes that \"social exclusion is about much more than just material deprivation or lack of work and income\". </p> <p>That is not a recently acquired opinion. Long before such theories were fashionable, Birmingham was forming neighbourhood councils to provide a forum for popular discussion and dissent. Two years ago, a democracy commission, under the chairmanship of Sir Adrian Cadbury, ex amined ways of ensuring \"greater democratic participation\" in the city's affairs. A New Partnership for Governance is the extension of the same objective. It invites comments on everything from the way in which the neighbourhood renewal fund - planned to spend \u00a344m in Birmingham in the next three years - should best be used, to the desirability of \"greater use of referendums in making local decisions\". It refers, in passing, to the national government's plans for greater local democracy. Birmingham has never thought it necessary to accept anyone else's advice. </p> <p>Birmingham will soon have to decide if it is to be led by a directly elected executive mayor - one of several options which the Local Government Act requires it to consider. It could choose an elected council leader supported either by a cabinet or a council manager. Only a mayor will satisfy Birmingham's civic pride. England's second city will want to elect the first provincial executive mayor. The ghost of Joe Chamberlain still haunts the council chamber. </p> <p>Cynics assume that Mr Bore hopes for the job. He is too intelligent to assume that, with his council record, he can win the Labour nomination. His support for an executive mayor is more political than personal, for he believes that he or she \"would give a direction to activity which a leader cannot provide\". Sir Michael, the chief executive, makes the same point in a less metaphysical and more critical form. \"The idea of electing a mayor scores highly if you want to run the council like a business. It scores badly if the council is to be democratic local government\". Running the council like a business is an increasingly popular notion in Whitehall as well as in Birmingham. </p> <p>Businesses are, at least theoretically, unpolitical institutions and critics of the executive mayor idea suspect that it is intended to take party politics out of local government. Birmingham may become the testing ground for the idea that a man or woman without an acknowledged ideology is more likely to meet a city's needs than councillors who are elected on the party ticket. The bookmakers' favourite to become Birmingham's first mayor is Carl Chinn, a lecturer in community history, star of local radio and once a bookmaker himself. He stood in the 1983 general election as an independent in order to draw attention to what he regarded as discrimination against the turf accountant's trade. Apart from a couple of years in the Social Democratic party he has no political experience. That, and his high profile, make him, on some people's calculation, the man most fitted to lead England's second city when the new municipal constitution is in place. </p> <p><strong>Behind closed doors</strong><br> </p> <p>Birmingham has already embraced half of the white paper's local government reforms. Departmental committees (in which members of all parties participated) have been replaced by a \"cabinet system\", in which an executive runs the city. The new system has irritated Labour traditionalists and infuriated Liberals and Conservatives who feel excluded from city management. The government's enthusiasm for municipal cabinets is based on its determination to end the system in which decisions were \"taken behind closed doors by political groups, or even by small groups of key people within the majority party\". In Birmingham, cabinets have produced exactly that result. </p> <p>In other councils, the cabinet includes members of all parties. Not in Birmingham. Other cities allow journalists to attend cabinet meetings. Birmingham does not. The logic of the \"scrutiny committees\", which examine the performance of each department, requires them to be chaired by opposition members. In Birmingham they come from the majority Labour group. Undisputed power does not seem to have enthused every Labour council for the municipal task. Anita Ward, the majority whip, is examining the practicality and legality of \"fining\" absentees from council meetings by reducing their annual honorariums. </p> <p>That is a sad commentary on a system which too often focuses more on arguments about council perks than the great issues of municipal government. Birmingham voters are clearly dubious about the value of local government. If the councillors themselves have doubts about the point of attending the council meetings, the whole system is in danger of death by neglect - at least in the great once all powerful cities where what we think of as local government was born. </p> <p><strong>Birmingham Facts &amp; figures</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Granted city status in 1889 </p> <p>\u0095 Population around 1,013,400 </p> <p>\u0095 Ethnic minorities form 21.5% of population with Pakistanis forming the largest single ethnic minority group (1991 census) </p> <p>\u0095 In February, seasonally adjusted unemployment figure stood at 34,162 </p> <p>\u0095 Birmingham has biggest housing department in England and Wales, managing 88,000 council houses </p> <p>\u0095 State education was pioneered in Birmingham in the 1850s and there are now three universities and more than 450 schools in the city </p> <p>\u0095 Birmingham has the largest public lending library in Europe </p> <p>\u0095 Of the 11 constituencies that serve Birmingham, 10 are held by Labour MPs and one by the Conservatives</p>",

      "bodyText": "Modern local government began in Birmingham when the mayor and corporation bought the town gasworks and water company and used the profit from light and heat to rebuild the crumbling sewers. The mayor was Joseph Chamberlain and the corporation believed in his Civic Gospel of Improvement. For more than a hundred years, councillors of England's second city continued to act with what Chamberlain called \"sagacious audacity\" - which to them meant a continual increase in expenditure and activity. At the height of its powers, the City of Birmingham owned hospitals, a bus and tramway company, more houses than any other landlord in the West Midlands, and a bank. It was the statutory police authority, managed what were wrongly called state schools, paid \"relief\" to the sick and unemployed and subsidised amenities of its own choice - parks, concert halls, allotments and museums - from rates which it levied at its own discretion. Birmingham councillors were not universally loved, but they were respected as men and women of authority. Ever since the days of Joe Chamberlain's Liberal caucus, party politics has been an essential ingredient in Birmingham local government. Labour has been in tight control for 17 years. Now there are 67 Labour councillors, 28 Conservative and 18 Liberals. There are also five members of Justice, a group of Muslims who demand \"freedom for Kashmir\". Whatever relevance their policy has to municipal government, they reflect the ethnic pattern of the city's population. The 1991 census identified 13.5% of the population as Asian. Half were of Pakistani origin. It is fashionable to suggest that strict party discipline has brought the council into disrepute. Sir Richard Knowles, Labour leader for 10 years, has a different explanation: \"We have lost popularity because we have lost power.\" Whatever the reason for their disenchantment, the people of Birmingham are not enthused by municipal politics. The turnout in the last local election was 28%. The public consultation which preceded the city budget attracted audiences of five in Liberal Yardley and 20 in Tory Sutton Coldfield. None of the meetings produced an outcry against the abandonment of, or reduction in, the caring services. The closure of day centres provoked barely a murmur of protest. Perhaps Birmingham has accepted the view of Sir Michael Lyons, Birmingham's chief executive and once a Labour councillor: \"What the council is expected to do is just not sustainable on present resources.\" Or it may be that the people no longer expect local government to meet their real needs. Birmingham local government is still big business. Its annual budget is more than \u00a32bn. Some 43,000 employees crowd its payroll. But it has lost many of the powers which directly affect the lives and welfare of its citizens. Some council services were nationalised by Labour. Others were privatised by Conservatives. Both parties hedged about council powers with so many regulations that, over great areas of policy, local government became no more than an agent of Whitehall and Westminster. Ministers call the tune because they pay the piper. Birmingham raises 11% of its revenue from council tax. The Treasury provides 63%. That equation makes independence impossible. Education is the one remaining service which gives city councils a popular appeal. The appearance of power deceives. \"In reality,\" says Albert Bore, the council leader, \"we are no longer an education authority. We neither directly provide the service nor set the standards\". Professor Tim Brighouse, the chief education officer, makes the same point in less apocalyptic language. \"It is our duty to secure the provision of an education service. But it is a moot point how much we provide ourselves\". The government's statement on The Role and Function of Local Education Authorities does not spare municipal feelings. It is not the authority's \"role to run or intervene in schools\". Sir Richard believes that we are witnessing \"the slow death of local government\". Mr Bore insists that councils still have a meaningful role. \"But it is not the role we have played over the last 100 years.\" Why, he asks, \"do we have to be a direct provider of services? Once there was nobody else around. Now there is. We can engage others to provide what we want\".

A white paper, Modern Local Government, leaves no doubt which of the partners is in charge. \"There is no future in the old model of councils trying to plan and run most services\". Instead they will be required \"to promote the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of their areas\". Birmingham has grasped - perhaps it even anticipated - one element in that stern injunction and elevated it to a new civic gospel. The idea that the corporation should actively encourage commercial development came upon the council gradually and was accepted by some councillors reluctantly and by others not at all. Twenty-five years ago, in a contest which was more about prestige than prosperity, Birmingham beat London in the race to become home to the National Exhibition Centre. Its success was never in doubt. But, situated on the southern boundary, the NEC has not made much of a contribution to the city's economy. It was valued as a status symbol. At one meeting, where the triumph over London was discussed, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra was offered as another example of provincial superiority. Everybody agreed that it needed a new concert hall. Nobody could think of a way to raise the money. Someone suggested an approach to the European Community. Initial enquiries suggested that, although the regional development fund would not invest in a concert hall, it might provide money for something bigger and better. The result was the International Convention Centre in which the development fund invested \u00a349.7m. The chamber of commerce and the local CBI thought it could be built next to, or as an extension of, the Exhibition Centre. But the council wanted it in the city centre. While Birmingham was still negotiating with Brussels, the old Victorian concert hall - not half a mile from Chamberlain Square and the town hall - burned down. The city centre was transformed. Almost a third of the council registered the Labour group complaint that Sir Richard was wasting time and money which should have been devoted to education. The convention centre whetted the council's appetite for commercial development. Over 15 years the EU invested another \u00a3175m on tearing the city apart and putting it back together again, as well as more than \u00a3100m in social fund programmes for neighbourhood regeneration. The National Indoor Arena was built next to the ICC. The city took a third share in a Hyatt hotel which was thought necessary to accommodate the expected flood of visitors. Since then hotel building has become a Birmingham growth industry. Few pumps have ever been primed so successfully. Brindley Place and the associated restoration of the canal basin is now a civic showpiece of shops and offices. Seven thousand new jobs have been created in the area, as many as there will be at Rover's Longbridge factory in 2002. The city's commitment to urban regeneration came to practical life in the spring of 1988 at a meeting between representatives of national and local government, business and the various planning professions. It was held at Highbury, once the home of the Chamberlains - a venue which was either prophetic or paradoxical depending on whether the new policy is regarded as a continuation of or a break with Birmingham's municipal tradition. From then on all plans for city generation were called \"Highbury\". The stated purpose of Highbury was \"to explore the relationship between economic activity and investment and the physical environment\". The council undertook to create the physical conditions for commercial growth in the city centre. Whether all the participants realised it or not, the civic gospel was taking on an economic dimension. The results have been a spectacular success for local government as \"facilitator\" rather than provider. Three potential developers - Hammersons, Henderson's and Land Securities - competed with each other for planning permission to regenerate part of the old Bull Ring. The council persuaded them to come together in a partnership which will create 8,000 new jobs. The Alliance consortium, as it is now called, is part of the massive regeneration initiative in which the city council \"brokers\" partnerships between the private and public sectors. From the old GPO sorting office, which has become a vast shopping mall, to Fort Dunlop which now advertises \"hotels, sports, eating, shops\", Birmingham's economy is changing. The 200,000 jobs which were lost between 1975 and 1985 (more than in Scotland and Wales combined) are gradually being replaced as service industries take over from manufacturing. The council - or at least its leader - is changing to accommodate the new world. Mr Bore's enthusiasm is instinctive. He is a technocrat by profession and, despite his leftwing past, a tycoon by temperament. Ironically, the Liberal and Conservative council leaders are beginning - despite their business backgrounds - to express fears that too much municipal time and effort is being spent on the city centre at the rest of Birmingham's expense. The Labour group has never disguised its doubts. Last May, Mr Bore was re-elected leader by a majority of one vote. The nature of the challenge that all but unseated him was confirmed by the quality of the near successful pretender. No one thought that Kevin Stacey had more ability than Mr Bore - just that he was different. The dissatisfaction may be diminished by the publication of A New Partnership for Governance, a consultation paper on the future of local government in Birmingham which addresses old problems in new language. The determination \"to tackle the deep seated problems of social exclusion\" are an echo of Joe Chamberlain's belief that \"an extension of the functions and authority\" of Birmingham corporation would assist in \"equalising the conditions of men\". In common with the mood of the moment, Birmingham believes that \"social exclusion is about much more than just material deprivation or lack of work and income\". That is not a recently acquired opinion. Long before such theories were fashionable, Birmingham was forming neighbourhood councils to provide a forum for popular discussion and dissent. Two years ago, a democracy commission, under the chairmanship of Sir Adrian Cadbury, ex amined ways of ensuring \"greater democratic participation\" in the city's affairs. A New Partnership for Governance is the extension of the same objective. It invites comments on everything from the way in which the neighbourhood renewal fund - planned to spend \u00a344m in Birmingham in the next three years - should best be used, to the desirability of \"greater use of referendums in making local decisions\". It refers, in passing, to the national government's plans for greater local democracy. Birmingham has never thought it necessary to accept anyone else's advice. Birmingham will soon have to decide if it is to be led by a directly elected executive mayor - one of several options which the Local Government Act requires it to consider. It could choose an elected council leader supported either by a cabinet or a council manager. Only a mayor will satisfy Birmingham's civic pride. England's second city will want to elect the first provincial executive mayor. The ghost of Joe Chamberlain still haunts the council chamber. Cynics assume that Mr Bore hopes for the job. He is too intelligent to assume that, with his council record, he can win the Labour nomination. His support for an executive mayor is more political than personal, for he believes that he or she \"would give a direction to activity which a leader cannot provide\". Sir Michael, the chief executive, makes the same point in a less metaphysical and more critical form. \"The idea of electing a mayor scores highly if you want to run the council like a business. It scores badly if the council is to be democratic local government\". Running the council like a business is an increasingly popular notion in Whitehall as well as in Birmingham. Businesses are, at least theoretically, unpolitical institutions and critics of the executive mayor idea suspect that it is intended to take party politics out of local government. Birmingham may become the testing ground for the idea that a man or woman without an acknowledged ideology is more likely to meet a city's needs than councillors who are elected on the party ticket. The bookmakers' favourite to become Birmingham's first mayor is Carl Chinn, a lecturer in community history, star of local radio and once a bookmaker himself. He stood in the 1983 general election as an independent in order to draw attention to what he regarded as discrimination against the turf accountant's trade. Apart from a couple of years in the Social Democratic party he has no political experience. That, and his high profile, make him, on some people's calculation, the man most fitted to lead England's second city when the new municipal constitution is in place. Behind closed doors Birmingham has already embraced half of the white paper's local government reforms. Departmental committees (in which members of all parties participated) have been replaced by a \"cabinet system\", in which an executive runs the city. The new system has irritated Labour traditionalists and infuriated Liberals and Conservatives who feel excluded from city management. The government's enthusiasm for municipal cabinets is based on its determination to end the system in which decisions were \"taken behind closed doors by political groups, or even by small groups of key people within the majority party\". In Birmingham, cabinets have produced exactly that result. In other councils, the cabinet includes members of all parties. Not in Birmingham. Other cities allow journalists to attend cabinet meetings. Birmingham does not. The logic of the \"scrutiny committees\", which examine the performance of each department, requires them to be chaired by opposition members. In Birmingham they come from the majority Labour group. Undisputed power does not seem to have enthused every Labour council for the municipal task. Anita Ward, the majority whip, is examining the practicality and legality of \"fining\" absentees from council meetings by reducing their annual honorariums. That is a sad commentary on a system which too often focuses more on arguments about council perks than the great issues of municipal government. Birmingham voters are clearly dubious about the value of local government. If the councillors themselves have doubts about the point of attending the council meetings, the whole system is in danger of death by neglect - at least in the great once all powerful cities where what we think of as local government was born.

It may not yet have succeeded in selling enough tickets for its new production of Boulevard Solitude, prompting tabloid accusations that the company is putting on \"difficult\" modern opera that no one wants to see. However, that is a marketing failure rather than a problem of the work or of the staging. Covent Garden has done eloquent justice to the piece that launched Hans Werner Henze's career in 1952 and is now being seen in London for the first time in 39 years. It is one of his best works, and as a tribute to the composer in the year of his 75th birthday its revival could hardly be more appropriate. </p> <p>Grete Weil's libretto is an updating of Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost's 1731 tale Manon Lescaut to France at the end of the second world war. The names are the same as in both Massenet's and Puccini's versions, but the emphasis has been shifted: in Boulevard Solitude it is the knight, Des Grieux - not Manon - who is the central character. Manon is much more prey than predator here, lethally manipulated by her own brother and helpless to do anything about it. Yet the tragedy of the lovers is presented with almost icy objectivity: there are no great passionate outbursts, no moments of soul-baring angst or opportunities for self-pity. </p> <p>It is very much a product of the postwar years, keeping its emotions tightly in check. When the action threatens to become deadly serious, an element of surreal farce is introduced to sweep that away. Henze's music, by turns coolly neoclassical, delicately atonal and raucously parodic (there are some fine pastiches of Kurt Weill and excursions into jazz), maps those changes unerringly. A model of economy, the work lasts just 80 minutes, and not a note is wasted. </p> <p>Nikolaus Lehnhoff's pro-duction is also wonderfully unfussy, yet it mixes realism and stylisation in a way that precisely corresponds to the turnabouts in the music. The railway station of the opening scene is grandiosely realised in Tobias Hoheisel's sets; the detail is precise but without ever being busy. The whole thing makes a hugely impressive package that is gorgeously sung, at least by the tenor Par Lindskog as a haunted Des Grieux, and Alexandra von der Weth as a lissom, alluring Manon. The rest of the cast are best described as efficient rather than special. Berhard Kontarsky conducts; the orchestral playing is first-rate. </p> <p>This is an achievement the Royal Opera can be genuinely proud of. It deserves a full house for every performance. </p> <p>In rep until April 4. Box office: 020-7304 4000. </p>",

Yet the tragedy of the lovers is presented with almost icy objectivity: there are no great passionate outbursts, no moments of soul-baring angst or opportunities for self-pity. It is very much a product of the postwar years, keeping its emotions tightly in check. When the action threatens to become deadly serious, an element of surreal farce is introduced to sweep that away. Henze's music, by turns coolly neoclassical, delicately atonal and raucously parodic (there are some fine pastiches of Kurt Weill and excursions into jazz), maps those changes unerringly. A model of economy, the work lasts just 80 minutes, and not a note is wasted. Nikolaus Lehnhoff's pro-duction is also wonderfully unfussy, yet it mixes realism and stylisation in a way that precisely corresponds to the turnabouts in the music. The railway station of the opening scene is grandiosely realised in Tobias Hoheisel's sets; the detail is precise but without ever being busy. The whole thing makes a hugely impressive package that is gorgeously sung, at least by the tenor Par Lindskog as a haunted Des Grieux, and Alexandra von der Weth as a lissom, alluring Manon. The rest of the cast are best described as efficient rather than special. Berhard Kontarsky conducts; the orchestral playing is first-rate. This is an achievement the Royal Opera can be genuinely proud of. It deserves a full house for every performance. In rep until April 4. Box office: 020-7304 4000.",

Today it is George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier, who is most closely associated with their high risk and speculative notoriety, after he forced the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism. Other headline stories, such as the international bail-out of Long Term Capital Management two years ago, have saddled hedge funds with the image of involving betting on the markets which can go wrong with dire consequences. Yet a recent report from the National Association of Pension Funds, which represents the industry, discusses this \"valuable addition\" to the range of products in which pension funds might invest. This is because not all hedge funds are the same and, according to some market experts, investing in some types of hedge fund when markets are falling might be the way to make money, seemingly against the odds. Alexander Ineichen, an analyst at investment bank UBS Warburg, pointed out that this ability to beat falling markets was one reason hedge funds began to be noticed. In 1990, for instance, Mr Soros's noted Quantum fund was up 30% when the overall US market fell by 3%. While times have changed for Quantum and Mr Soros, the NAPF notes that the flexibility hedge funds enjoy in their investment strategies means that they can can \"produce attractive returns in economic and market conditions in which traditional investments - equities and fixed interest bonds - are depressed\". There are four main types of hedge fund: \u0095 Market neutral or relative value, which try to exploit market inefficiences or mispricing; \u0095 Event driven, which invest on anticipated mergers, bankruptcy or corporate reorganisations; \u0095 Long/short, which allow fund mangers to buy some assets but sell others they do not yet own; \u0095 Tactical trading, perhaps the most volatile of all, which speculate on the future direction of markets. Hedge funds are not for everyone. Nick Fitzpatrick, who is head of global investments at Bacon &amp; Woodrow, which advises leading institutions on their investments, said: \"We're not advising clients to invest in hedge funds because we consider them unproven.\" The way hedge funds perform during the present market turbulence might be crucial if they are to win greater acceptance.",

The second, Fever, is set to the more obviously dance-friendly Monteverdi, but to a recording of the composer's Madrigals and Sinfonias by the Concerto Italiano, under Rinaldo Alessandrini. </p> <p>It is no accident that the titles of both works suggest a fiercely physical response to their scores, for Alston is rarely less than passionate. Yet both works tell us more about the way Alston translates notes into steps than about the stories he may hear in his scores. </p> <p>Alston's programme note eloquently describes Shostakovich's quartet as a work of bright surfaces and dark shadows, subtly conveying the terrors of life under Stalin. Yet the drama he conveys in his choreography tends to be one of scale and texture rather than graphic body language. In the opening movement a passage of near-unison dance fragments into separate lines as the dancers ricochet against the increasingly jagged phrasing of the strings. At the close, when a single violin plays against the murmuring of the other instruments, the dance pares down to a duet so intimate it barely takes up space. </p> <p>Only in the dark central section is there the feel of a narrative subtext as Pari Naderi and Lee Clayden's duet becomes fraught with backward glances, tiny knocking rhythms of feet and warding gestures of the arms. But while this passage chimes with hints of danger, it is not enough to create a theatrical whole. Shostakovich's quartet is long and episodic, and because Alston avoids imposing his own logic on to it, the dance lacks dramatic momentum. </p> <p>The same is true of Fever. The tone of this work ought to be very different, drenched as it is in golden light and set to Monteverdi's rushes of sound. Early in the piece Naderi rapturously arches her upper body as if trying to drown herself in the music. Following her lead, the rest of the dancers mould themselves languorously against each other, or shiver in sudden frenzies of movement. But Fever rarely takes us beyond each beautiful, supercharged moment; it rarely makes us curious about what is coming next. This is partly a product of its musical purism, but it is also partly a problem created by the youthfulness of Alston's company. Apart from Naderi and the excellent Martin Lawrence, we don't seek out individual dancers in the choreography. As performers they add little drama to the stage. They are still just bodies making shapes to music. </p> <p>Until tomorrow. Box office: 020-7960 4242.</p>",

Art Hogan, the chief market analyst at Jefferies and Co, the brokerage, said: \"There is both irrational disappointment that the US Federal Reserve could have done more - which would have meant that the outlook was even bleaker - and a more rational concern based on the fundamental news coming from companies themselves.\" In spite of the difficulties of the past week, the US market was braced for more bad news. The quarterly earnings season, when companies report the outlook for future performance, is only halfway through.

Tony is struggling to get over the death of his lover, Frankie, six months earlier, by starting an affair with a young Mancunian, Iggy. But he is impeded at every turn, first by Frankie's mother, Mary - determined to keep her son's memory alive - then by his lodger, Kevin, and a lesbian friend, Monica, who know that Iggy is infinitely more than a harmless pick-up. </p> <p>As plots go, it is a perfectly good one. And Harvey clearly understands the tenacity of grief. But Harvey is the victim of his own facility. In the first act he brings on Mary's boozy mate, Rose, who is full of amusing fantasies about her encounters with the famous. The only problem is that this Dalston Mistress Quickly is superfluous to the plot. And, though we soon grasp that the sentimentalised Frankie was a faithless hypocrite, it takes an age for everyone else to make the same admission and for Tony to realise that it is time for him to move on. </p> <p>The good bits of the play are highly enjoyable, though. Foremost among these is Linda Bassett's performance as Mary - a particularly well-written character. Mary dispenses food and radiates garrulous cheer while clinging to false memories of her dead son out of loneliness and guilt. Harvey grants her many of the play's best lines. Given a Mykonos-holiday sarong by Monica, Mary waltzes around in it, crying, \"It'd make a lovely picnic rug. Or a baby's blanket.\" She exudes chatty, cheerful, joint-smoking bonhomie, but Bassett also suggests a woman who will fight like a tigress to protect the image of Frankie. </p> <p>There is also a fine moment at the end when the colour seems to drain from Bassett's still, stricken features; but it is symptomatic of Harvey's and Burke's talent for excess that they prolong a perfect image and back it with Orfeo's operatic lament for Eurydice. </p> <p>Radically cut, this would be a very good play; and one might admire even more the performances of Mark Bonnar as Tony, of Michele Austin as his thick-skinned actress chum and of Sean Gallagher as the devoted, drunken lodger. </p> <p>Harvey certainly can write: what he now needs is to meet a play-doctor who will put him on a strict dramatic diet. </p> <p>Until April 14.

      "body": "<p>Amid the investor stampede to sell stocks as the markets plummeted last week, one firm on the fringes of the financial services industry announced it had done its best day's business in more than 25 years. After a fall of more than 250 points on the Dow Jones index on Wednesday spread betting firm, IG Index was inundated with calls and emails from private investors wanting to make money by betting on further misfortune hitting the markets. </p> <p>\"Our phones were ringing non-stop and the internet was firing away madly,\" a spokesman said. \"At 4am one customer placed a \u00a350-per-point bet on the Dow falling and, by the end of the day, took home more than \u00a315,600. People were frantically looking for opportunities to make a profit from market volatility.\" The number of customers betting on a further fall in the market increased fourfold, he said. </p> <p>While the more cautious private investors have retired from the markets to nurse their losses, a hardcore of bold - some would say foolhardy - day traders insist there is plenty of money to be made amid plummeting stocks, profit warnings and redundancy announcements. </p> <p>Until recently, it has been difficult for private investors to speculate on a fall in shares. But the advent of innovative online investment methods and up-to-the-minute financial news has opened up opportunities for \"shorting\" the market - that is, speculating on a fall - to any investor with modest savings and a modem. </p> <p>Edward Kalfayan, a retired businessman turned private investor who trades from two screens in his bedroom in Wimbledon, south London, said the current bearish environment is an ideal opportunity to abandon traditional brokers in favour of financial spread betting firms which offer bets on a fall in market indices, as well as on a rise. \"If there is still an adjustment to come, spread betting is the best way to capitalise on a downward move,\" he said. </p> <p>Because of the highly-leveraged nature of spread bets, a small stake can produce colossal returns if investors correctly anticipate dramatic market shifts. A broker at one spread betting firm said that investors are increasingly learning to look at dips in the market as opportunities, though most bets are still placed on stocks to rise. \"Recently, the biggest winners are people who went short of the Nasdaq anything up to six months ago,\" he said. \"They have made a lot of money - up to \u00a320,000 or \u00a330,000, off a \u00a35 or \u00a310 stake.\" </p> <p>When taking out a spread bet, customers specify how much they wish to bet per point move in the market. For example, a down bet on the Nasdaq of \u00a35 a point, followed by a 100 point fall, would result in a \u00a3500 profit - 100 times the original \u00a35 stake. </p> <p>Stock market historian David Schwartz said that historical patterns suggest that the British stock market has been due to drop to a long-term trend line for some time. \"History tells us that shares don't do very well after an enormous rise. In the UK, we ended 1974 at the bottom of an awful bear market, the worst we have ever had, but we have been going up almost ever since,\" he said. \"We have just had the greatest stock market bubble in modern history on the Nasdaq.

      "bodyText": "Amid the investor stampede to sell stocks as the markets plummeted last week, one firm on the fringes of the financial services industry announced it had done its best day's business in more than 25 years. After a fall of more than 250 points on the Dow Jones index on Wednesday spread betting firm, IG Index was inundated with calls and emails from private investors wanting to make money by betting on further misfortune hitting the markets. \"Our phones were ringing non-stop and the internet was firing away madly,\" a spokesman said. \"At 4am one customer placed a \u00a350-per-point bet on the Dow falling and, by the end of the day, took home more than \u00a315,600. People were frantically looking for opportunities to make a profit from market volatility.\" The number of customers betting on a further fall in the market increased fourfold, he said. While the more cautious private investors have retired from the markets to nurse their losses, a hardcore of bold - some would say foolhardy - day traders insist there is plenty of money to be made amid plummeting stocks, profit warnings and redundancy announcements. Until recently, it has been difficult for private investors to speculate on a fall in shares. But the advent of innovative online investment methods and up-to-the-minute financial news has opened up opportunities for \"shorting\" the market - that is, speculating on a fall - to any investor with modest savings and a modem. Edward Kalfayan, a retired businessman turned private investor who trades from two screens in his bedroom in Wimbledon, south London, said the current bearish environment is an ideal opportunity to abandon traditional brokers in favour of financial spread betting firms which offer bets on a fall in market indices, as well as on a rise. \"If there is still an adjustment to come, spread betting is the best way to capitalise on a downward move,\" he said. Because of the highly-leveraged nature of spread bets, a small stake can produce colossal returns if investors correctly anticipate dramatic market shifts. A broker at one spread betting firm said that investors are increasingly learning to look at dips in the market as opportunities, though most bets are still placed on stocks to rise. \"Recently, the biggest winners are people who went short of the Nasdaq anything up to six months ago,\" he said. \"They have made a lot of money - up to \u00a320,000 or \u00a330,000, off a \u00a35 or \u00a310 stake.\" When taking out a spread bet, customers specify how much they wish to bet per point move in the market. For example, a down bet on the Nasdaq of \u00a35 a point, followed by a 100 point fall, would result in a \u00a3500 profit - 100 times the original \u00a35 stake. Stock market historian David Schwartz said that historical patterns suggest that the British stock market has been due to drop to a long-term trend line for some time. \"History tells us that shares don't do very well after an enormous rise. In the UK, we ended 1974 at the bottom of an awful bear market, the worst we have ever had, but we have been going up almost ever since,\" he said. \"We have just had the greatest stock market bubble in modern history on the Nasdaq. And when bubbles burst, the index virtually always goes down to the long-term trend line - which is around 1,400 to 1,500 on the Nasdaq.\" However, such theorising is of limited value to short-term investors looking for returns on volatile stocks. Mr Kalfayan decided to place a heavy bet on a fall in the markets in January, but lost out after the US Federal Reserve's dramatic cut in interest. \"The index shot up like an Indian rope trick,\" he said. \"I don't want to go into figures, but I lost a packet.\" Another increasingly popular alternative to conventional investments are equity contracts for difference (CFDs).

Despite being closely associated with George Soros, the Hungarian born speculator who crippled the pound during the ERM crisis, a number of major investment firms are beginning to offer such products for investors. Proceed with caution, though, is the warning from the financial services authority to investors thinking of putting their tax-free savings into this most exotic type of individual savings plan. The regulator is concerned that the rush to invest before the end of the tax year may cloud investors' judgment about such funds which can involve higher risks. Among the firms beginning to offer the hedge funds, more usually the preserve of the rich, are Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Jupiter and Henderson. Chris Demarco, managing director at CSFB, agreed with the FSA's point that these products were attractive for people who already have other types of investments.
