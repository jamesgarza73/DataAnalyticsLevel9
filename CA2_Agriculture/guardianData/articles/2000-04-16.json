      "body": "<p>Had Manchester United lost to Sunderland after naming David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole only as substitutes, the FA might have felt compelled to use their rarely invoked rule against clubs deliberately fielding understrength sides. Even having won so handily that the charge would have been ludicrous, United should feel grateful that the FA is unable to prosecute managers for taking the mickey. </p> <p>It is one thing for Ferguson to bring Ole Gunnar Solskjaer off the bench or, as on Saturday, to give him a starting slot (and be rewarded with a goal in two minutes). But purely to amuse himself Ferguson brought off his \u00a310m centre-half Jaap Stam 11 minutes into the second half and threw on Henning Berg. And what happened? Berg, who had gone two years and 78 games since his only other goal for United, took only 14 minutes to score his side's fourth and final goal. </p> <p>With the game reduced to about 20 seconds of highlights on the BBC's Match Of The Day, I even thought the United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich had been cheekily replaced at half-time to ensure his fitness to face Real Madrid on Wednesday. But he, at least, was genuinely injured. </p> <p>Ferguson, whose team have already set a Premiership goals record and may yet eclipse Everton's record title-winning margin of 13 points in 1985 - achieved in a 22-team top division - could be justified in declaring his side the best in United's history. But it is also true that the opposition has been more pathetic than that ranged against Ken Livingstone for London mayor. The rejuvenated Liverpool at least managed to continue their run of consistency by winning at Wimbledon.

      "bodyText": "Had Manchester United lost to Sunderland after naming David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole only as substitutes, the FA might have felt compelled to use their rarely invoked rule against clubs deliberately fielding understrength sides. Even having won so handily that the charge would have been ludicrous, United should feel grateful that the FA is unable to prosecute managers for taking the mickey. It is one thing for Ferguson to bring Ole Gunnar Solskjaer off the bench or, as on Saturday, to give him a starting slot (and be rewarded with a goal in two minutes). But purely to amuse himself Ferguson brought off his \u00a310m centre-half Jaap Stam 11 minutes into the second half and threw on Henning Berg. And what happened? Berg, who had gone two years and 78 games since his only other goal for United, took only 14 minutes to score his side's fourth and final goal. With the game reduced to about 20 seconds of highlights on the BBC's Match Of The Day, I even thought the United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich had been cheekily replaced at half-time to ensure his fitness to face Real Madrid on Wednesday. But he, at least, was genuinely injured. Ferguson, whose team have already set a Premiership goals record and may yet eclipse Everton's record title-winning margin of 13 points in 1985 - achieved in a 22-team top division - could be justified in declaring his side the best in United's history. But it is also true that the opposition has been more pathetic than that ranged against Ken Livingstone for London mayor. The rejuvenated Liverpool at least managed to continue their run of consistency by winning at Wimbledon. But even if they beat Everton at Goodison on Friday, it is likely only to delay United's coronation until Easter Monday when, traditionally, the championship should be just coming to the boil. In the past two seasons, the intensity of the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United has seen the title decided only on the season's final day. But despite their brilliant 4-0 win at Leeds yesterday, Arsenal have already lost eight games this season, twice as many as last. Chelsea, who would be rubbing shoulders with United at the top if they could only speak Premiership English as fluently as Italian and Spanish, lost their seventh league match of the season at Sheffield Wednesday. And poor, sad Leeds were suffering their 11th defeat of the season against Arsenal. Leeds' young players have simply run themselves into the ground this season and their manager David O'Leary has no one like Solskjaer or Berg to bring in to \"freshen up the side\" as Ferguson describes replacing one superstar with another. It is more convincing evidence that the Premiership is several small leagues within a league.

      "body": "<p>This may have been football's first night-day match. It began under floodlights and ended in sun. But the sun shone only for Preston, now eight points clear at the top, with 12 to play for. </p> <p>Night continues for Rovers, top a month ago but suddenly anxious about the play-offs after two points out of 18. Ian Holloway said: \"We're on the crest of a slump but you won't get me criticising the players.\" He sounded like a manager desperately seeing a prize slip from his grasp, a dream turn to a nightmare. He felt \"like I've been mugged\". </p> <p>In fact Rovers are mugging themselves with blown confidence. Holloway sent them off for golf last week to rediscover it. They came back shanking and slicing as Preston stuck to the fairway. \"We didn't create enough down the flanks and, when we did, there was not enough in the centre,\" he said. It hardly mattered what was in the centre. All their crosses were noughts, mainly slewed for goal-kicks. It could have been the rugby XV on parade. </p> <p>Holloway tried various patterns, as if he was into feng shui, but they came to the same thing, mostly bang and bin, for all David Hillier's attempts to create a passing harmony. </p> <p>In such conditions the lines that count are led from the back. Michael Jackson was superb for Preston, leading by example, holding the shape four-square on a skidpan, absorbing pressure and rain and judging interceptions with uncanny command - Stonewall Jackson himself. Though they had scored only three goals in six games, Preston have conceded one in seven. They have lost only twice away in 21 games, conceding 12 goals. </p> <p>David Moyes said \"nothing pleases a manager more than seeing his centre-forwards making goals for each other\". It was less direct than that. Bjarki Gunnlaugsson set up Paul McKenna, whose shot came back off a post for Jonathan Macken to snap home his 22nd league goal of the season. </p> <p>Then from Macken's cross the Icelander whipped in his first league goal since arriving in October. Michael Appleton was the inspiration, with a backheel to Macken, then a dummy over the cross. He, Macken and Colin Murdock joined Preston for \u00a31m from Old Trafford. It speaks for itself. </p> <p>It was tough on Lee Jones. Sometimes a goalkeeper's life is not unlike an anaesthetist's: 98% boredom and 2% panic. Tepi Moilanen's was quieter still as he kept his 21st clean sheet in 37 games.

      "bodyText": "This may have been football's first night-day match. It began under floodlights and ended in sun. But the sun shone only for Preston, now eight points clear at the top, with 12 to play for. Night continues for Rovers, top a month ago but suddenly anxious about the play-offs after two points out of 18. Ian Holloway said: \"We're on the crest of a slump but you won't get me criticising the players.\" He sounded like a manager desperately seeing a prize slip from his grasp, a dream turn to a nightmare. He felt \"like I've been mugged\". In fact Rovers are mugging themselves with blown confidence. Holloway sent them off for golf last week to rediscover it. They came back shanking and slicing as Preston stuck to the fairway. \"We didn't create enough down the flanks and, when we did, there was not enough in the centre,\" he said. It hardly mattered what was in the centre. All their crosses were noughts, mainly slewed for goal-kicks. It could have been the rugby XV on parade. Holloway tried various patterns, as if he was into feng shui, but they came to the same thing, mostly bang and bin, for all David Hillier's attempts to create a passing harmony. In such conditions the lines that count are led from the back. Michael Jackson was superb for Preston, leading by example, holding the shape four-square on a skidpan, absorbing pressure and rain and judging interceptions with uncanny command - Stonewall Jackson himself. Though they had scored only three goals in six games, Preston have conceded one in seven. They have lost only twice away in 21 games, conceding 12 goals. David Moyes said \"nothing pleases a manager more than seeing his centre-forwards making goals for each other\". It was less direct than that. Bjarki Gunnlaugsson set up Paul McKenna, whose shot came back off a post for Jonathan Macken to snap home his 22nd league goal of the season. Then from Macken's cross the Icelander whipped in his first league goal since arriving in October. Michael Appleton was the inspiration, with a backheel to Macken, then a dummy over the cross. He, Macken and Colin Murdock joined Preston for \u00a31m from Old Trafford. It speaks for itself. It was tough on Lee Jones. Sometimes a goalkeeper's life is not unlike an anaesthetist's: 98% boredom and 2% panic. Tepi Moilanen's was quieter still as he kept his 21st clean sheet in 37 games. At the final whistle he was not even threatened by Rovers fans. Remaining games: Bristol Rovers: Apr 22 Bristol City (h); Apr 24 Blackpool (a); Apr 29 Bournemouth (h); May 6 Cardiff (a) Preston: Apr 22 Scunthorpe (h); Apr 24 Cambridge (a); Apr 29 Millwall (h); May 6 Bristol City (a)",

The report will be put on my desk and the necessary will be done to whomever did not do their duty,\" said Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan earlier today.</p> <p>But he told the Radikal newspaper that policing such running street battles was difficult. \"It is not easy to decide who is guilty or the victim in that chaos,\" he said.

The Fiver's worst player of the year 1999 has been engulfed in controversy this weekend after a high-profile advertising campaign involving his ginger barnet was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority.</p> <p>According to a complaint from rival company Skolas Reform Clinics, Advanced Hair Studios falsely claimed that their 'ADVANCED laser therapy' had restored Hartson's hair. A Skolas representative had seen John Hartson in the flesh you see (he must work in the Dons' treatment room) and was convinced the Welshman was showing no hairy benefits from his treatment. Hartson's before and after photos, they insisted, must have been fake.</p> <p>Not so, said the ASA, who ruled the pics were genuine (even the one with Hartson wearing a ginormous metal egg on his head). But further investigation led them to rule against the ad for different reasons, namely the use of the word 'regrow'. \"Because the advertisers had not sent clinical evidence that proved their treatments could regrow hair,\" wrote the ASA in their adjudication, \"they were asked to remove the claim\".</p> <p>So what in heck is going on on John's scalp? Amidst fears that Hartson's head is being used as a guinea pig (to which it has always borne a resemblance), the Fiver desperately tried to contact AHS today. But we were told the only man who knows the secret of the treatment is the company chairman, and he's in Australia. Skolas' mysterious Hartson spotter has also disappeared. Wimbledon too are silent on the matter, their only comment being to laugh at the Fiver's promise to \"get to the roots of the problem\". Which we will.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We are trying to catch up [with United] and the first thing we can try to do is catch up on the field.\" Cos let's face it, you'll never catch them in traffic. Gerard Houllier, playing the 'umble card.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ALL HAIL FERG THE CONQUEROR</strong></p> <p>Since the collapse of the Roman Empire, only a handful of leaders have possessed the necessary strength in depth, tactical acumen and puritanical zeal to truly dominate European competition. In the 12th century Genghis Khan made a decent stab at it, as did Napoleon and Hitler. Now in this new millennium we hear of another man, strong of mouth and fierce of temper, who casts his eyes on our fair continent and craves an empire which will last a thousand years.</p> <p>That man is the Lord Imperial Ferg. \"This may be a golden period for Manchester United, so we've got to take advantage because it may never come again\" he thundered earlier today. \"We've got to set our standards by the big European winners. Then we'll find out where we rank as a great European club.\" Fergie then bizarrely warned his players what would happen in the bedroom if their determination slackened. \"Look at our 1968 team too - marvellous players who were getting old. They won it once, but they couldn't keep it up.\"</p> <p>Dave Beckham need only look at Barcelona to see the wisdom of his boss's observation. Barely a fortnight ago Barca were rulers of the universe elect, heading towards inevitable victory in the league and cup, not to mention Big Cup. Four defeats in a row later, and they're on their knees. \"I'm sure the fans understand the situation we're in\" said Luis Figo unconvincingly last night, denying that arrogance was behind Barca's change in fortunes.

      "bodyText": "TURKS TO INVESTIGATE POLICE OVER ISTANBUL VIOLENCE The Turkish government have launched an investigation into the actions of police during clashes in which two British football supporters were fatally stabbed. \"The security forces are investigating this event internally. The report will be put on my desk and the necessary will be done to whomever did not do their duty,\" said Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan earlier today. But he told the Radikal newspaper that policing such running street battles was difficult. \"It is not easy to decide who is guilty or the victim in that chaos,\" he said. Newspapers have criticised police for failing to prevent the clashes, which had reportedly been brewing for several hours. Tantam also revealed that Galatasaray will be accompanied by an 11-member anti-terrorist squad when they travel to Leeds later this week. Ercument Yilmaz, Istanbul's deputy police chief, is quoted in the Turkish press as saying: \"After being officially assigned, we would protect Galatasaray better than the English - no one should doubt about that.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT'S JUST LIKE A LITTLE HARRY HILL! Enter First Direct's Little Fella Challenge and you could win a VW Beetle or Sony Wega Widescreen TV. * * * * * * * * * * * * * GINGER-GATE What the hell is going on with John Hartson's hair? The Fiver's worst player of the year 1999 has been engulfed in controversy this weekend after a high-profile advertising campaign involving his ginger barnet was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority. According to a complaint from rival company Skolas Reform Clinics, Advanced Hair Studios falsely claimed that their 'ADVANCED laser therapy' had restored Hartson's hair. A Skolas representative had seen John Hartson in the flesh you see (he must work in the Dons' treatment room) and was convinced the Welshman was showing no hairy benefits from his treatment. Hartson's before and after photos, they insisted, must have been fake. Not so, said the ASA, who ruled the pics were genuine (even the one with Hartson wearing a ginormous metal egg on his head). But further investigation led them to rule against the ad for different reasons, namely the use of the word 'regrow'. \"Because the advertisers had not sent clinical evidence that proved their treatments could regrow hair,\" wrote the ASA in their adjudication, \"they were asked to remove the claim\". So what in heck is going on on John's scalp? Amidst fears that Hartson's head is being used as a guinea pig (to which it has always borne a resemblance), the Fiver desperately tried to contact AHS today. But we were told the only man who knows the secret of the treatment is the company chairman, and he's in Australia. Skolas' mysterious Hartson spotter has also disappeared. Wimbledon too are silent on the matter, their only comment being to laugh at the Fiver's promise to \"get to the roots of the problem\". Which we will. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We are trying to catch up [with United] and the first thing we can try to do is catch up on the field.\" Cos let's face it, you'll never catch them in traffic. Gerard Houllier, playing the 'umble card. * * * * * * * * * * * * * ALL HAIL FERG THE CONQUEROR Since the collapse of the Roman Empire, only a handful of leaders have possessed the necessary strength in depth, tactical acumen and puritanical zeal to truly dominate European competition. In the 12th century Genghis Khan made a decent stab at it, as did Napoleon and Hitler. Now in this new millennium we hear of another man, strong of mouth and fierce of temper, who casts his eyes on our fair continent and craves an empire which will last a thousand years. That man is the Lord Imperial Ferg. \"This may be a golden period for Manchester United, so we've got to take advantage because it may never come again\" he thundered earlier today. \"We've got to set our standards by the big European winners. Then we'll find out where we rank as a great European club.\" Fergie then bizarrely warned his players what would happen in the bedroom if their determination slackened. \"Look at our 1968 team too - marvellous players who were getting old. They won it once, but they couldn't keep it up.\" Dave Beckham need only look at Barcelona to see the wisdom of his boss's observation. Barely a fortnight ago Barca were rulers of the universe elect, heading towards inevitable victory in the league and cup, not to mention Big Cup. Four defeats in a row later, and they're on their knees. \"I'm sure the fans understand the situation we're in\" said Luis Figo unconvincingly last night, denying that arrogance was behind Barca's change in fortunes. Pep Guardiola concurred. \"We're going to win and we're going to go through to the semi-finals,\" the old charmer said.

His sculpting of the dancers' tableaux achieves a luminous intensity of line and imagery, their religious iconography overlaid with an erotic frisson. Yet Ashton's heavy reliance on hectoring gestures and frenzied runs to generate emotion now appears clumsily artless. This kind of raw physical expression was being handled with far greater sophistication by modern dance choreographers in the US and central Europe. And Ashton knew this. As the two later ballets in the programme prove - Scenes de Ballet (1948) and Enigma Variations (1968) - Ashton's genius flourished in classical soil. \u0095 Until April 20.

      "byline": "Kate Hilpern",

      "body": "<p>Take heed: saboteur secretaries are on the loose. You could be sitting next to one right now. Dressed smartly, hair neatly glossed, fantastic typing speed - saboteur secs sport the uniform of any office worker. But as you get on with your daily routine, the quiet revolutionary next door could be rapidly destroying part of your company's computer system - all without a trace of evidence. </p> <p>Sound over the top? Police in the City of London don't think so. Still stinging after the violence of last June's anti-capitalist riots in the City, police are taking seriously the threat of sabotage from anarchists who may try to infiltrate big companies to coincide with this year's protests, planned for May 1. Last week, they issued a warning to companies in the country's financial heart to be on their guard against temporary workers who may come to work with a hidden agenda. </p> <p>\"We are aware that a number of events are being planned for the May bank holiday weekend,\" admits a spokesperson from the Metropolitan Police, adding that they are merely taking precautionary measures to avoid a repeat of last year's protest, in which rioters brought terror to the financial district and caused \u00a32m of damage. </p> <p>Whether or not the police are being over-cautious, their concern highlights the ease with which determined saboteurs could access the vulnerable and vastly expensive systems of a major corporation. Posing as temps, they would target jobs only in the Square Mile in firms with which they had an axe to grind. Once past security - who, like everyone else, believe the temp is there to do some extra filing - he or she could place a tiny file on a computer system, finish the temporary job, and vanish. At a specified time, hackers would then be able to dial in from anywhere in the world and use the file to open the system to attacks. Alternatively, the saboteur could leave programmes that would go into action automatically, crashing the system at a specific time and date. </p> <p>Secretarial posts are a better option than IT roles, the anarchists believe, because they cause less suspicion and have a higher turnover of staff. It may also make it easier to win the trust of sympathetic permanent staff, who may offer to give them a helping hand. Alternatively, determined infiltrators could help rioting associates outside by leaving doors open, allowing them to storm company headquarters. </p> <p>One of the main problems for law-enforcers is that few individual members of anti-capitalist groups are known to them. It is almost excusable when you consider that even the City of London commissioner claimed last year that \"they reveal a level of sophistication and planning not seen before\". Some of those posing as temps even carry the FT with them at all times to ensure they look the part. The fact that some on-line recruitment companies supply temporary workers without having conducted personal interviews is also making the path for saboteur support staff more tempting than it might otherwise have been. You simply send a CV into cyberspace and hey presto, you've got the City post you're after. </p> <p>But the recruitment establishment is far from toothless in confronting the threat from people who are not who they claim to be. Recruitment consultants specialising in City appointments and employers themselves are beginning to recognise their vulnerability to a determined criminal, and have introduced tighter selection methods. Step into Jonathan Wren, for instance, and you'll find your references may be checked for up to 10 years. \"If there's a gap in employment, we'll want to know why and we'll check it out,\" says Philip Ayling, associate director. </p> <p>Some employers have even resorted to lie-detecting methods - though not yet using electrodes strapped to the body. Instead, increasingly numbers of employers use psychologists and psychometric testing to wean out individuals who may be suspect. According to Dr Richard Wiseman, a specialist in lie-detection at Hertfordshire University, observing leg and arm movements is particularly effective. When movement is exaggerated, there's a good chance the candidate is fibbing. \"Another giveaway is the extent to which hands are used to touch body and face,\" he says. \"We tend to touch ourselves more when we are lying. It's almost as if we are trying to appear sincere by pointing to ourselves more and saying, 'Would I lie to you?'\" </p> <p>Of course, it is not only anti-capitalist and anarchist elements that employers are on their guard against. The risk of industrial sabotage and fraud is increasing, and computer systems need to be made ever more complex to beat talented computer fraudsters. These people can steal millions of pounds, destroy the evidence by vandalising the computer system, and then hand in their notice and disappear. </p> <p>In addition, what has been dubbed \"work rage\" drives many to plant \"computer bombs\" that can cripple an employer's entire IT network.

      "bodyText": "Take heed: saboteur secretaries are on the loose. You could be sitting next to one right now. Dressed smartly, hair neatly glossed, fantastic typing speed - saboteur secs sport the uniform of any office worker. But as you get on with your daily routine, the quiet revolutionary next door could be rapidly destroying part of your company's computer system - all without a trace of evidence. Sound over the top? Police in the City of London don't think so. Still stinging after the violence of last June's anti-capitalist riots in the City, police are taking seriously the threat of sabotage from anarchists who may try to infiltrate big companies to coincide with this year's protests, planned for May 1. Last week, they issued a warning to companies in the country's financial heart to be on their guard against temporary workers who may come to work with a hidden agenda. \"We are aware that a number of events are being planned for the May bank holiday weekend,\" admits a spokesperson from the Metropolitan Police, adding that they are merely taking precautionary measures to avoid a repeat of last year's protest, in which rioters brought terror to the financial district and caused \u00a32m of damage. Whether or not the police are being over-cautious, their concern highlights the ease with which determined saboteurs could access the vulnerable and vastly expensive systems of a major corporation. Posing as temps, they would target jobs only in the Square Mile in firms with which they had an axe to grind. Once past security - who, like everyone else, believe the temp is there to do some extra filing - he or she could place a tiny file on a computer system, finish the temporary job, and vanish. At a specified time, hackers would then be able to dial in from anywhere in the world and use the file to open the system to attacks. Alternatively, the saboteur could leave programmes that would go into action automatically, crashing the system at a specific time and date. Secretarial posts are a better option than IT roles, the anarchists believe, because they cause less suspicion and have a higher turnover of staff. It may also make it easier to win the trust of sympathetic permanent staff, who may offer to give them a helping hand. Alternatively, determined infiltrators could help rioting associates outside by leaving doors open, allowing them to storm company headquarters. One of the main problems for law-enforcers is that few individual members of anti-capitalist groups are known to them. It is almost excusable when you consider that even the City of London commissioner claimed last year that \"they reveal a level of sophistication and planning not seen before\". Some of those posing as temps even carry the FT with them at all times to ensure they look the part. The fact that some on-line recruitment companies supply temporary workers without having conducted personal interviews is also making the path for saboteur support staff more tempting than it might otherwise have been. You simply send a CV into cyberspace and hey presto, you've got the City post you're after. But the recruitment establishment is far from toothless in confronting the threat from people who are not who they claim to be. Recruitment consultants specialising in City appointments and employers themselves are beginning to recognise their vulnerability to a determined criminal, and have introduced tighter selection methods. Step into Jonathan Wren, for instance, and you'll find your references may be checked for up to 10 years. \"If there's a gap in employment, we'll want to know why and we'll check it out,\" says Philip Ayling, associate director. Some employers have even resorted to lie-detecting methods - though not yet using electrodes strapped to the body. Instead, increasingly numbers of employers use psychologists and psychometric testing to wean out individuals who may be suspect. According to Dr Richard Wiseman, a specialist in lie-detection at Hertfordshire University, observing leg and arm movements is particularly effective. When movement is exaggerated, there's a good chance the candidate is fibbing. \"Another giveaway is the extent to which hands are used to touch body and face,\" he says. \"We tend to touch ourselves more when we are lying. It's almost as if we are trying to appear sincere by pointing to ourselves more and saying, 'Would I lie to you?'\" Of course, it is not only anti-capitalist and anarchist elements that employers are on their guard against. The risk of industrial sabotage and fraud is increasing, and computer systems need to be made ever more complex to beat talented computer fraudsters. These people can steal millions of pounds, destroy the evidence by vandalising the computer system, and then hand in their notice and disappear. In addition, what has been dubbed \"work rage\" drives many to plant \"computer bombs\" that can cripple an employer's entire IT network. A recent study published by the American society of industrial security found that vengeful employees are now the biggest security worry for 90% of US bosses. And while less research has been carried out in the UK, anecdotal evidence confirms we're catching up fast.

      "bodyText": "Abbey National plans to revolutionise the way mortgage brokers sell its home loans with an internet system that could allow approvals within 60 seconds. The new Abbey service will involve 10,000 mortgage brokers gaining access to its new, \"intelligent\" mortgage introducer internet service at a cost of \u00a35m. Ambrose McGinn, director of retail e-commerce at Abbey, said that by using the system a mortgage intermediary should be able to speed up the process of arranging mortgage. He admitted that if it proved successful it had implications for \"low value\" jobs which are connected to processing and filling in mortgage application forms. The system will also be a model for the bank's push into the stakeholder pension market later in the year, where direct sales and on-site marketing, whether in the workplace or in the home, is considered important. \"We'll have an e-commerce facility for that too,\" Mr McGinn said. He claimed that the bank already had guarantees of \u00a33bn of mortgage business from \"key introducers\" over the new online service. \"With 50% of our mortgage business supplied by intermediaries, the new introducer internet services will respond to all improvements that our contacts have been crying out for, namely speed of service, flexibility regarding time availability and up to the minute tracking of customers' cases,\" he said. Abbey said that while the new system could mean a \"decision in principle\" would be made in a minute, it calculates it could take 10 minutes from \"start to decision\", still an improvement on the three hours that is the norm at present. The service will provide real time tracking of cases throughout the process between 8am and 10pm, seven days a week, and aims to scrap any unnecessarily filling-in of forms. John Malone, the national mortgage manager at Scottish Amicable, added: \"It's an impressive online service. Buying a home or moving is one of the biggest events in anyone's life so we encourage anything that makes that process easier.\"",

This issue is now becoming more than about Summerhill. The Secretary of State is clearly trying to undermine the decisions of an independent tribunal that did not go his way. His arrogance in attempting to back-track is a threat to justice as well as to Summerhill School.</p> <p>I was present at the Independent Schools Tribunal that heard the Summerhill case. I also chaired a team that carried out an independent inquiry into the school and we urged David Blunkett voluntarily to do precisely what he had to concede at the tribunal. I'm saddened that he does not have the good grace to accept his defeat and let Summerhill School get on with its work. The facts are as Nick Cohen presented them in his article.</p> <p>What David Blunkett appears to be doing is trying to create a situation where he can, at will, renege on legal agreements to suit his own purposes. Lord Haskins (chairman of the Government's better regulation task force) was quoted recently as saying that the DfEE 'is the most Stalinist department I have ever come across'. How right he is - and how dangerous for all of us.<br><b> Professor Ian Cunningham </b><br>Brighton</p> <p>\u0095 David Blunkett's letter taking Nick Cohen to task is not about Summerhill School at all - it is about governmental power and a refusal to recognise when it is in the wrong.</p> <p>Mr Cohen was absolutely spot on when he said that Summerhill had not agreed to 'encourage children to attend lessons', as it did no such thing. The agreement allows the school to follow the system and philosophy of A.S. Neill, whose writing makes it perfectly clear that he was against any form of direction or suggestion to his pupils.</p> <p>It is very disturbing to see the DfEE - supposedly in charge of the moral welfare of our children - behaving like this. <br><b> Zoe Readhead </b><br>Principal, Summerhill School <br>Leiston, Suffolk</p>",

      "bodyText": "I write in response to David Blunkett (Letters, last week) compounding the lies already put out by his press office about Summerhill School. This issue is now becoming more than about Summerhill. The Secretary of State is clearly trying to undermine the decisions of an independent tribunal that did not go his way. His arrogance in attempting to back-track is a threat to justice as well as to Summerhill School. I was present at the Independent Schools Tribunal that heard the Summerhill case. I also chaired a team that carried out an independent inquiry into the school and we urged David Blunkett voluntarily to do precisely what he had to concede at the tribunal. I'm saddened that he does not have the good grace to accept his defeat and let Summerhill School get on with its work. The facts are as Nick Cohen presented them in his article. What David Blunkett appears to be doing is trying to create a situation where he can, at will, renege on legal agreements to suit his own purposes. Lord Haskins (chairman of the Government's better regulation task force) was quoted recently as saying that the DfEE 'is the most Stalinist department I have ever come across'. How right he is - and how dangerous for all of us. Professor Ian Cunningham Brighton \u0095 David Blunkett's letter taking Nick Cohen to task is not about Summerhill School at all - it is about governmental power and a refusal to recognise when it is in the wrong. Mr Cohen was absolutely spot on when he said that Summerhill had not agreed to 'encourage children to attend lessons', as it did no such thing. The agreement allows the school to follow the system and philosophy of A.S. Neill, whose writing makes it perfectly clear that he was against any form of direction or suggestion to his pupils. It is very disturbing to see the DfEE - supposedly in charge of the moral welfare of our children - behaving like this. Zoe Readhead Principal, Summerhill School Leiston, Suffolk",

In politics, all good ideas are eventually pressed too far. Inspiring innovations, introduced into bureaucracies, become oppressive systems.

And now this has happened with targets.</p> <p>It was John Major with his Citizen's Charter, not New Labour, who began the audit revolution. As he says in his memoirs, 'publishing the performances of different schools, hospitals, local authorities or transport services would act as a kind of surrogate competition to raise standards.' And it was a good idea. He was right. The National Audit Office has been trying to measure outputs, in a rough way, since the time of Pepys but the great difference has been to use it as a external political weapon, not simply an internal system of housekeeping.</p> <p>Even as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were mocking it all to death across the Commons chamber, they were watching and learning. New Labour took Major's audit culture and then turned it against a host of enemies. First, in 1996-7 it was used against Major himself: by offering pledge cards and reams of targets by which they should be judged, Blair and Brown challenged the voters to take them seriously as leaders committed to modernity, efficiency and delivering the goods. 'We will raise this; we will double that, and halve this ...' From class sizes to waiting lists, it was their response to the charge that Labour was fuzzy. And it worked.</p> <p>Next, in government, public auditing became the core weapon of Treasury control over other departments - the comprehensive spending review is basically a mass of management and output targets. On a wider front, it has been increasingly used to fill the hole left by ideology, as an ultimate self-justification beyond ordinary politics. 'Don't judge us by left or right ideas, judge us by results. You think we are wrong? But we have cut waiting lists for heart operations by X per cent. How can that be \"wrong\"?' In this way, cleverly set targets, well-promoted, become a kind of irrefutable political language in themselves.</p> <p>I am not trying to suggest that this hollows out everything else; if you work through the mass of targets set by New Labour, its values shine through very clearly - a government of the right would never make as much of targets on child poverty, class sizes or racial harassment. Nor is this kind of auditing bad in itself; there certainly was an idle and sod-the-public mentality through much of the state bureaucracy. Short of fiery swords and flails of scorpions, I don't know what else would work.</p> <p>But we are now at a stage in this Government's life when the target-frenzy needs to be cooled, shaken and reassessed. When I typed the words 'health' and 'target' into one government computer search engine, it offered me a choice of 25,998 different documents. Every government department offers you lists of self-flagellating targets with the pathetic zeal of revisionist bourgeois undergoing Maoist self-criticism.

New targets for police Best Value Performance Plans, government online services and Britain's share of the global higher education market (all 'tough') don't bite until 2005. The - yes, tough - targets on reducing children's road deaths are for 2010; the same goes for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and the percentage of electricity from renewable resources.</p> <p>Outside Whitehall, there are already a fantastic range of dodges used by hospitals and consultants to achieve the Government's waiting-list and other targets and schools. The same goes for the chivvied, target-bound local authorities. When John Prescott announced his (excellent) new package on reviving council estates on Thursday, it came with a raft of new monitoring including explicit performance targets - 'tough ones', reporters noted with amazement - and 'national efficiency guidelines' run by government statisticians, for refuse collection, road maintenance and so on.

      "body": "<p>A multi-billion pound package of measures to tackle Britain's crippling transport crisis will be unveiled in July, as the Government attempts to head off public anger about its failed election promises.</p> <p>Treasury officials have been told to open their coffers to fund 'revolutionary' plans to unblock the roads, overhaul rail services and improve public transport.</p> <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott have ordered officials to produce plans for the strategy, which will cost up to \u00a310 billion. Details will be released in a spending review this summer.</p> <p>Projects that will be given top priority include:</p> <p>\u0095 double-decker trains for commuters, with every traveller guaranteed a seat.</p> <p>\u0095 more money for the West Coast mainline to speed up journey times between London, Manchester and Glasgow.</p> <p>\u0095 new high-speed routes into cities, with buses and trams being given dedicated lanes.</p> <p>\u0095 light rail schemes to take pressure off congested roads.</p> <p>\u0095 a task force to tackle traffic jam hotspots, such as the M25 orbital route round London and M6 Midlands corridor.</p> <p>\u0095 new bypasses around traffic-hit towns.</p> <p>\u0095 national concession scheme, so pensioners get cheap public transport.</p> <p>\u0095 'super interchanges' where people can move easily from motorways to rail and buses.</p> <p>The Government spends less on transport than any other country in Europe. But Ministers know that continuing snarl-ups on roads, delayed trains and poor bus services could cost votes.</p> <p>Businesses have also complained bitterly that traffic jams and the rail failure has left them with billions of pounds of unnecessary costs.</p> <p>Although many initiatives have been announced, polling evidence reveals that the public and the business community are not convinced by the Government's efforts.</p> <p>Government sources said the new money would be tied to results, with every plan given an inflexible deadline.</p> <p>Figures prepared for Prescott's Transport Department reveal that two-thirds of Londoners travel to work by public transport, but outside London two-thirds of people use their cars. Officials refused to be drawn on how much money would be spent, but there is speculation it could be as much as \u00a310bn of extra funding in the first three years.</p> <p>Further big increases will also be agreed as part of the Government's 10-year strat egy on transport. Ministers were delighted with the reaction to the \u00a32bn a year lifeline Brown threw to the NHS in last month's Budget. They want a similar 'big bang' for transport. Such a large amount of money will allow the Government to demand results from rail companies and local authorities on transport as they now do from the health service.</p> <p>Discussions on the 'transport revolution' started last year when the Treasury put forward a position paper on the need for more funding.</p> <p>Civil servants at the Department of Transport produced a manifesto for change. Lord Macdonald, the Transport Minister, is working on the details and will show them to the Prime Minister, Chancellor and Deputy Prime Minister after Easter.</p> <p>News of the cash injection comes as the latest damning report reveals the chronic state of Britain's roads. The annual local authority road maintenance survey (the Alarm report) reveals that more than three-quarters of councils believe that the under-funding of road maintenance is a threat to safety.</p> <p>More than \u00a350 million has been paid out in compensation to people injured in road accidents or who have had their vehicles damaged.</p> <p>Many councils say they can only afford to resurface roads every 78 years rather than the 20 years safety campaigners suggest.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:kamal.ahmed@observer.co.uk\">kamal.ahmed@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Chancellor Gordon Brown and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott have ordered officials to produce plans for the strategy, which will cost up to \u00a310 billion. Details will be released in a spending review this summer. Projects that will be given top priority include: \u0095 double-decker trains for commuters, with every traveller guaranteed a seat. \u0095 more money for the West Coast mainline to speed up journey times between London, Manchester and Glasgow. \u0095 new high-speed routes into cities, with buses and trams being given dedicated lanes. \u0095 light rail schemes to take pressure off congested roads. \u0095 a task force to tackle traffic jam hotspots, such as the M25 orbital route round London and M6 Midlands corridor. \u0095 new bypasses around traffic-hit towns. \u0095 national concession scheme, so pensioners get cheap public transport. \u0095 'super interchanges' where people can move easily from motorways to rail and buses. The Government spends less on transport than any other country in Europe. But Ministers know that continuing snarl-ups on roads, delayed trains and poor bus services could cost votes. Businesses have also complained bitterly that traffic jams and the rail failure has left them with billions of pounds of unnecessary costs. Although many initiatives have been announced, polling evidence reveals that the public and the business community are not convinced by the Government's efforts. Government sources said the new money would be tied to results, with every plan given an inflexible deadline. Figures prepared for Prescott's Transport Department reveal that two-thirds of Londoners travel to work by public transport, but outside London two-thirds of people use their cars. Officials refused to be drawn on how much money would be spent, but there is speculation it could be as much as \u00a310bn of extra funding in the first three years. Further big increases will also be agreed as part of the Government's 10-year strat egy on transport. Ministers were delighted with the reaction to the \u00a32bn a year lifeline Brown threw to the NHS in last month's Budget. They want a similar 'big bang' for transport. Such a large amount of money will allow the Government to demand results from rail companies and local authorities on transport as they now do from the health service. Discussions on the 'transport revolution' started last year when the Treasury put forward a position paper on the need for more funding. Civil servants at the Department of Transport produced a manifesto for change. Lord Macdonald, the Transport Minister, is working on the details and will show them to the Prime Minister, Chancellor and Deputy Prime Minister after Easter. News of the cash injection comes as the latest damning report reveals the chronic state of Britain's roads. The annual local authority road maintenance survey (the Alarm report) reveals that more than three-quarters of councils believe that the under-funding of road maintenance is a threat to safety. More than \u00a350 million has been paid out in compensation to people injured in road accidents or who have had their vehicles damaged. Many councils say they can only afford to resurface roads every 78 years rather than the 20 years safety campaigners suggest. kamal.ahmed@observer.co.uk",

The proposed move by the Secretary of State is part of a series of steps contained in a new initiative drawn up in London and Dublin aimed at restoring devolution. The broad outline of the two governments' position paper includes the following: \u0095 the IRA to state that its war is finished forever; \u0095 the British government then to end the suspension of devolution. If the Ulster Unionists agree, the Irish and British governments will seek confirmation from the IRA that decommissioning will hap pen within a longer timeframe. The British will give some concessions to David Trimble's party on the Patten report, particularly the retention of the Harp and Crown badge on new police uniforms. A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Office said the key issue was to get 'clarity' from the IRA on decommissioning - securing answers to two questions posed by SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon last year: 'Will you decommission, and when will you do it?' British and Irish officials have been working frantically to draw up a common position paper. Jonathan Powell, Downing Street's chief-of-staff, is understood to have been in Dublin last weekend discussing the way forward with officials from the Republic.

      "bodyText": "The investigation into IRA agents working inside the Garda may have to be extended to cover alleged Provisional moles in the Irish army. A former Provisional IRA fire-bomber has told The Observer that an intelligence officer in the Irish defence forces helped the IRA in the Monaghan-Armagh border region during the 1980s. The officer passed information and helped to clear roads for the IRA commander Jim Lynagh, who was shot dead by the SAS at Loughgall in 1987, according to the former Provo. Vincent McKenna, who has turned his back on republican violence, said Lynagh told him that he had an agent working inside the Defence Forces' barracks in Monaghan town. The claims are bound to dismay many Irish soldiers, who tend to be hostile to republican terrorism. McKenna said that Lynagh used the officer to clear roads leading to Northern Ireland during an IRA attack on an RUC border station in the late Eighties. 'My job in the run-up to that operation was to gather intelligence on the base. I had to measure the distance from the base to the Monaghan side of the border in order that the mortar rounds were fired accurately. 'After the attack took place I remember talking to Jim Lynagh about it. He told me he got someone from the barracks to clear the road for his unit, and when I asked who, he just said \"an officer in intelligence who had been in the army for 15 years\". 'It was around this time that our policy towards the Army and the Garda in Monaghan changed.

Then Lynagh said the aggro had to stop. I can only assume the reason was because he had an agent working for him in the bar racks and there was no point antagonising the Free Staters in the base,' McKenna said. The ex-IRA man said he was prepared to pass on his information to the investigation team established by the Irish government into alleged collusion between individual Gardai and the IRA. 'I have no faith in any inquiry, because if it really looked at what was going on _ there would be an international outcry. In places like Monaghan we had supporters in mainstream political parties like Fianna Fail, who helped local IRA volunteers and backed the republican cause,' he said. The Republic's Justice Minister, John O'Donoghue, said that the investigation into claims of IRA moles in the Garda were of the 'utmost seriousness'. But he questioned whether there was enough 'tangible evidence' to convict any police officer serving or retired, of offences connected to aiding the IRA. The claims that individual Garda and now Irish soldiers secretly worked for the IRA during the height of the Troubles have fuelled demands from unionists for the Irish government to hold inquiries into collusion. Until recently the Irish government backed northern nationalist demands for inquiries into alleged collusion between British security forces and loyalist terrorists. The family and colleagues of nationalist solicitor Rosemary Nelson, who was murdered in a loyalist bomb attack last year, claim that prior to her murder she was threatened by RUC officers.",

      "body": "<p>A young British woman spoke yesterday for the first time about her ordeal after she fled a Thai jail and escaped through the jungles of Malaysia before making it home safely to Britain last week.</p> <p>More than a stone lighter and with her hair falling out in clumps because of stress, 21-year-old Judith Payne told how she walked for two weeks through Malaysian rainforest in plastic flip-flops after spending weeks locked in a fetid prison cell, where she was being held for drug offences.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview with The Observer, the dental nurse from Yorkshire described how she dodged armed police and border patrols while navigating with a compass as she made her desperate attempt to get home.</p> <p>The nightmare began after Payne left home in Castleford four months ago for a backpacking trip to Thailand and Australia. She wanted to travel after splitting up with her fianc\u00e9 and reading The Beach, the bestselling novel by Alex Garland - now a film - about backpacking adventures in Thailand.</p> <p>She used the money saved for her wedding to fund the trip. But instead of lazing on exotic beaches, she found herself crammed into a cell with 24 other prisoners in the notorious 'Bangkok Hilton', the rat-infested women's jail in the Thai capital where violence among inmates is rife and suicides are commonplace.</p> <p>It had all started so promisingly last December. After kissing her mother and 15-year-old brother goodbye, she took one last look at the redbrick houses of her home town and the giant smoking towers of a nearby power station before flying out to the Far East. While Britain shivered, she spent Christmas and New Year on Ko Chang, a beautiful island in the Gulf of Thailand. Her days were spent snorkeling and sunbathing. 'It was all I'd dreamt it would be,' she said yesterday. 'I missed my mum, but it was incredible to be in this beautiful place.'</p> <p>Relaxed and tanned, Payne decided to travel to Bangkok on her way to the north of the country to see the bridge over the River Kwai, immortalised in the film starring Alec Guinness about British prisoners of war forced to build a railway crossing for the Japanese.</p> <p>After arriving in Bangkok, she had hoped to meet up with traveller friends in the city's Khao San road, a haven for European backpackers lined with cheap guesthouses. Waiting for a room to empty, she recognised James Gilligan, a 26-year-old from her home town. She had seen him around at home and they had mutual friends. A graphic designer, Gilligan was also taking time out to travel.</p> <p>He was also struggling to find a bed for the night and the pair agreed to share the only twin-bedded room available.</p> <p>'He was going to an island the next day to find his friends, so he went off to arrange things and I went and booked my ticket,' said Payne. She waited for friends downstairs, but they did not turn up. Gilligan and Payne both turned in for the night.</p> <p>What happened next is still traumatic for Judith. 'I woke up to banging on the door. James was panicking and I didn't know why. He told me he had bought drugs and he was trying to hide the package, but there was no window to throw it out of. It all happened in a flash: the police burst in with guns and James just held this package out and said: \"Here, it's mine.\"</p> <p>'Everyone was talking at once and yelling at James, and I was scared to death. I thought, well, at least he has admitted it, but then they handcuffed us together and took us to the police station. I was crying, I didn't know what was happening.'</p> <p>Interrogated and put in a holding cell overnight, a shocked and frightened Payne was attacked by prisoners who tried to steal her diamond earrings. An officer allowed her to e-mail her mother Valerie. 'I was shaking and sobbing, all I could think of was how worried she was going to be when she read it. But I still thought I'd get out in an hour or so.'</p> <p>Gilligan and Payne were taken to court. No one could explain what was happening because no one spoke English. Within hours, Judith had been forced to strip in front of 30 other prisoners; she was intimately searched and handed a brown prison sarong to wear. 'I was thinking: \"I want my mum\",' she said.</p> <p>When the door swung open to the cell, 74 women in a narrow brick and iron-barred room stared at her. The stupefying heat, buzz of flies and stench from the communal latrine almost made her faint. That night she cried herself to sleep while the other women, mostly drug addicts and thieves, laughed at her distress.</p> <p>'They would talk about me among themselves and point at how red my nose got when I cried. One woman spoke English, but as soon as I refused to give her money she would pretend not to hear me when I talked to her.'</p> <p>She had no idea how the routine worked or how to get food or water. 'In the mornings everyone raced to this trough and tried to throw a bit of water over themselves, but everyone was pushing and shoving and you were lucky to get any. Chaos. Then we had to sit under an open-sided building until it was time to go to back to the cells. I thought I'd rot away there.</p> <p>'Everyone slept head to toe in lines on the cell floor, with no room to turn over. The richest ones could sleep near the door; the poorer you were the closer to the toilet hole you had to lie,' said Payne. Wealthier prisoners could also become warders. The guards gave them sticks to beat their fellow prisoners and many would also abuse inmates sexually. 'There was a lot of pressure on the women from the lesbian warders.

      "bodyText": "A young British woman spoke yesterday for the first time about her ordeal after she fled a Thai jail and escaped through the jungles of Malaysia before making it home safely to Britain last week. More than a stone lighter and with her hair falling out in clumps because of stress, 21-year-old Judith Payne told how she walked for two weeks through Malaysian rainforest in plastic flip-flops after spending weeks locked in a fetid prison cell, where she was being held for drug offences. In an exclusive interview with The Observer, the dental nurse from Yorkshire described how she dodged armed police and border patrols while navigating with a compass as she made her desperate attempt to get home. The nightmare began after Payne left home in Castleford four months ago for a backpacking trip to Thailand and Australia. She wanted to travel after splitting up with her fianc\u00e9 and reading The Beach, the bestselling novel by Alex Garland - now a film - about backpacking adventures in Thailand. She used the money saved for her wedding to fund the trip. But instead of lazing on exotic beaches, she found herself crammed into a cell with 24 other prisoners in the notorious 'Bangkok Hilton', the rat-infested women's jail in the Thai capital where violence among inmates is rife and suicides are commonplace. It had all started so promisingly last December. After kissing her mother and 15-year-old brother goodbye, she took one last look at the redbrick houses of her home town and the giant smoking towers of a nearby power station before flying out to the Far East. While Britain shivered, she spent Christmas and New Year on Ko Chang, a beautiful island in the Gulf of Thailand. Her days were spent snorkeling and sunbathing. 'It was all I'd dreamt it would be,' she said yesterday. 'I missed my mum, but it was incredible to be in this beautiful place.' Relaxed and tanned, Payne decided to travel to Bangkok on her way to the north of the country to see the bridge over the River Kwai, immortalised in the film starring Alec Guinness about British prisoners of war forced to build a railway crossing for the Japanese. After arriving in Bangkok, she had hoped to meet up with traveller friends in the city's Khao San road, a haven for European backpackers lined with cheap guesthouses. Waiting for a room to empty, she recognised James Gilligan, a 26-year-old from her home town. She had seen him around at home and they had mutual friends. A graphic designer, Gilligan was also taking time out to travel. He was also struggling to find a bed for the night and the pair agreed to share the only twin-bedded room available. 'He was going to an island the next day to find his friends, so he went off to arrange things and I went and booked my ticket,' said Payne. She waited for friends downstairs, but they did not turn up. Gilligan and Payne both turned in for the night. What happened next is still traumatic for Judith. 'I woke up to banging on the door. James was panicking and I didn't know why. He told me he had bought drugs and he was trying to hide the package, but there was no window to throw it out of. It all happened in a flash: the police burst in with guns and James just held this package out and said: \"Here, it's mine.\" 'Everyone was talking at once and yelling at James, and I was scared to death. I thought, well, at least he has admitted it, but then they handcuffed us together and took us to the police station. I was crying, I didn't know what was happening.' Interrogated and put in a holding cell overnight, a shocked and frightened Payne was attacked by prisoners who tried to steal her diamond earrings. An officer allowed her to e-mail her mother Valerie. 'I was shaking and sobbing, all I could think of was how worried she was going to be when she read it. But I still thought I'd get out in an hour or so.' Gilligan and Payne were taken to court. No one could explain what was happening because no one spoke English. Within hours, Judith had been forced to strip in front of 30 other prisoners; she was intimately searched and handed a brown prison sarong to wear. 'I was thinking: \"I want my mum\",' she said. When the door swung open to the cell, 74 women in a narrow brick and iron-barred room stared at her. The stupefying heat, buzz of flies and stench from the communal latrine almost made her faint. That night she cried herself to sleep while the other women, mostly drug addicts and thieves, laughed at her distress. 'They would talk about me among themselves and point at how red my nose got when I cried. One woman spoke English, but as soon as I refused to give her money she would pretend not to hear me when I talked to her.' She had no idea how the routine worked or how to get food or water. 'In the mornings everyone raced to this trough and tried to throw a bit of water over themselves, but everyone was pushing and shoving and you were lucky to get any. Chaos. Then we had to sit under an open-sided building until it was time to go to back to the cells. I thought I'd rot away there. 'Everyone slept head to toe in lines on the cell floor, with no room to turn over. The richest ones could sleep near the door; the poorer you were the closer to the toilet hole you had to lie,' said Payne. Wealthier prisoners could also become warders. The guards gave them sticks to beat their fellow prisoners and many would also abuse inmates sexually. 'There was a lot of pressure on the women from the lesbian warders. It was very frightening. 'But the worst was the beatings. Old women and the mentally ill were all shoved in together and often beaten. I saw a pregnant woman being battered by sticks. It was terrible to watch. One woman was really sick and died in our cell; the guards told her family she had slit her wrists, but it was because they didn't get her a doctor.' With no one to talk to, Payne could only sit in the sweltering heat, swatting at the flies and mosquitoes. A woman from the British Embassy came to visit her and gave her two books: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and the true-life tale of a woman imprisoned for killing her mother. In England, the Payne and Gilligan families were told by the Foreign Office what had happened. A Bangkok lawyer was hired and, after three weeks, the pair were released on bail of \u00a35,000 each, raised by their families. Gilligan was waiting for Payne when she was released.

      "body": "<p>Britain's dentists are inflicting at least \u00a3200 million of unnecessary and even harmful treatment on patients each year, according to one of the UK's most respected dental experts. </p> <p>A damning report, to be presented to the Dental Practice Board conference in Eastbourne tomorrow, will say that dentists are boosting their incomes by insisting on too many check-ups, taking too many X-rays, doing unnecessary scaling and polishing, and replacing fillings too frequently. </p> <p>Aubrey Sheiham, professor of public health at University College London, says: 'Numerous dental procedures are ineffective at best and harmful in many cases.' </p> <p>The study is a dramatic demonstration of recent concern that dentists - who earn on average \u00a350,000 a year - are being financially motivated to do treatments that are based on tradition rather than medical evidence. Last month the National Institute of Clinical Excellence ruled that dentists should stop taking wisdom teeth out as a precautionary measure. It said there was no evidence that there is any medical benefit from extracting wisdom teeth unless they are diseased. </p> <p>Sheiham claims there is no medical evidence to support dentists' insistence that people need a check-up every six months. The twice-yearly check-up was first mentioned in The Toothache, a storybook for children published in 1849, that quickly entered dental mythology. 'Recall intervals can safely be extended to 18 months for most age groups. For those over 20 years old, longer intervals of three to five years are recommended,' says the study. Overall, adults endure between 6 million and 10 million unnecessary dental check-ups each year, wasting up to \u00a3120m. </p> <p>More than 13 million scalings and polishings are done every year, at a cost to the NHS of more than \u00a3100m, and yet there is no evidence of any medical benefit. Within 72 hours they are as dirty as they were before the cleaning. There is also no benefit from having X-rays every year. Dental decay is so slow that X-rays are only required every five years. Replacing missing molars with false teeth may have a cosmetic benefit but there is no health gain. Modern foods are so tender they can easily be chewed without the full set of molars. </p> <p>Studies show that dentists replace fillings far more than necessary, and that if they suffer a drop in income, they will replace their patients' fillings more frequently. The less someone visits a dentist, the longer their fillings last, because it gives their dentist fewer opportunities to replace them prematurely. </p> <p>Fillings should last at least 15 years, and Sheiham claims that if a filling needs replacing within five years, it is professional incompetence and should be replaced free. The reason that women lose their teeth earlier than men, he says, is because they visit their dentist more often. </p> <p>Compared with other doctors, dentists have almost total clinical freedom to do whatever they want, and are paid for each piece of work they do. A year after having his wisdom teeth out, Theo Howe was told by his dentist that he needed 13 fillings. He sought a second opinion from another dentist who told him he needed only one. 'It was clear the dentist was just trying to boost her work. I find it gutting that I went through all the pain and expense of having my wisdom teeth out when it was completely unnecessary,' he said. 'But there is little you can do but trust your dentist.' </p> <p>Dentists are only likely to face discipline in extreme cases, but can then be barred from practising. Earlier this year Stuart Molloy, who claimed to be one of Britain's best dental surgeons, was struck off after giving 18 unnecessary root fillings to a man who had visited him with a cracked tooth and sore tongue. Another patient, Sheila Muggleston, visited Molloy's practice complaining of pain in her upper jaw, and ended up spending \u00a32,000 on dental treatment that left her with broken facial bones. Molloy told another patient she needed all her top teeth taken out, although a second opinion revealed she only had one problem tooth. Molloy claimed he was trying to nip problems in the bud. </p> <p>Another dentist, Melvyn Megitt, earned \u00a3600,000 in a single year by seeing 150 patients a day. Megitt was eventually found guilty on five charges of misconduct after deliberately snapping braces to ensure they needed further treatment. </p> <p>Sheiham claims that the amount of unnecessary dental work will increase unless the number of dentists is cut back sharply. Improving dental health - the result of better diet and toothpaste not better dental treatment - means there is less and less work for dentists to do. He says that idle dentists will find new markets: 'A hungry dentist is a dangerous dentist. Dentists will look for new work to do.

      "bodyText": "Britain's dentists are inflicting at least \u00a3200 million of unnecessary and even harmful treatment on patients each year, according to one of the UK's most respected dental experts. A damning report, to be presented to the Dental Practice Board conference in Eastbourne tomorrow, will say that dentists are boosting their incomes by insisting on too many check-ups, taking too many X-rays, doing unnecessary scaling and polishing, and replacing fillings too frequently. Aubrey Sheiham, professor of public health at University College London, says: 'Numerous dental procedures are ineffective at best and harmful in many cases.' The study is a dramatic demonstration of recent concern that dentists - who earn on average \u00a350,000 a year - are being financially motivated to do treatments that are based on tradition rather than medical evidence. Last month the National Institute of Clinical Excellence ruled that dentists should stop taking wisdom teeth out as a precautionary measure. It said there was no evidence that there is any medical benefit from extracting wisdom teeth unless they are diseased. Sheiham claims there is no medical evidence to support dentists' insistence that people need a check-up every six months. The twice-yearly check-up was first mentioned in The Toothache, a storybook for children published in 1849, that quickly entered dental mythology. 'Recall intervals can safely be extended to 18 months for most age groups. For those over 20 years old, longer intervals of three to five years are recommended,' says the study. Overall, adults endure between 6 million and 10 million unnecessary dental check-ups each year, wasting up to \u00a3120m. More than 13 million scalings and polishings are done every year, at a cost to the NHS of more than \u00a3100m, and yet there is no evidence of any medical benefit. Within 72 hours they are as dirty as they were before the cleaning. There is also no benefit from having X-rays every year. Dental decay is so slow that X-rays are only required every five years. Replacing missing molars with false teeth may have a cosmetic benefit but there is no health gain. Modern foods are so tender they can easily be chewed without the full set of molars. Studies show that dentists replace fillings far more than necessary, and that if they suffer a drop in income, they will replace their patients' fillings more frequently. The less someone visits a dentist, the longer their fillings last, because it gives their dentist fewer opportunities to replace them prematurely. Fillings should last at least 15 years, and Sheiham claims that if a filling needs replacing within five years, it is professional incompetence and should be replaced free. The reason that women lose their teeth earlier than men, he says, is because they visit their dentist more often. Compared with other doctors, dentists have almost total clinical freedom to do whatever they want, and are paid for each piece of work they do. A year after having his wisdom teeth out, Theo Howe was told by his dentist that he needed 13 fillings. He sought a second opinion from another dentist who told him he needed only one. 'It was clear the dentist was just trying to boost her work. I find it gutting that I went through all the pain and expense of having my wisdom teeth out when it was completely unnecessary,' he said. 'But there is little you can do but trust your dentist.' Dentists are only likely to face discipline in extreme cases, but can then be barred from practising. Earlier this year Stuart Molloy, who claimed to be one of Britain's best dental surgeons, was struck off after giving 18 unnecessary root fillings to a man who had visited him with a cracked tooth and sore tongue. Another patient, Sheila Muggleston, visited Molloy's practice complaining of pain in her upper jaw, and ended up spending \u00a32,000 on dental treatment that left her with broken facial bones. Molloy told another patient she needed all her top teeth taken out, although a second opinion revealed she only had one problem tooth. Molloy claimed he was trying to nip problems in the bud. Another dentist, Melvyn Megitt, earned \u00a3600,000 in a single year by seeing 150 patients a day. Megitt was eventually found guilty on five charges of misconduct after deliberately snapping braces to ensure they needed further treatment. Sheiham claims that the amount of unnecessary dental work will increase unless the number of dentists is cut back sharply. Improving dental health - the result of better diet and toothpaste not better dental treatment - means there is less and less work for dentists to do. He says that idle dentists will find new markets: 'A hungry dentist is a dangerous dentist. Dentists will look for new work to do. They'll tell patients to have their teeth whitened or straightened; they'll tell them to replace coloured fillings with white ones. They will start offering treatments to stop snoring, although there's no evidence that it works.' anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

Instead, she will have to walk the three miles from her village on Anglesey to her job as office administrator for the RSPB in its Bangor office, and hope it isn't raining.</p> <p>'Every trip, whether to work, going shopping or even a day out at a weekend, ends up as a planning marathon,' she says. Starting at 5am is not unknown. A journey to Cardiff last month saw her take a cab to Bangor station, wait on a cold platform for the 6am train that took her on a four-hour detour into England, before dropping her at the Cardiff platform 20 stations later at just after 10 o'clock. Five hours to cover just over 200 miles.</p> <p>And then there's Sophie Tranchell, managing director of the Day Chocolate Company in London. She became so frustrated with five months of delays, missed connections and non-appearing buses that she moved the office so it was closer to where she lived.</p> <p>'It can be a truly miserable experience travelling at rush hour from my station, Lewisham, into central London,' she says. 'Even now, I get on to the platform in the morning and sigh when the train turns up, literally stuffed full of very unhappy, stressed people, because there aren't enough carriages. At the old office, when I finally got into London, I ended up waiting for ridiculous amounts of time on tube platforms for the phantom Circle line.'</p> <p>And then there's Heather Smith, a support worker for adults with learning disabilities, who has to co-ordinate shift work on different sites around Brighton with caring for a young baby. After struggling for a year, Heather has given up on relying on buses and trains and bought a car.</p> <p>'In the year since I had Conlan, trying to make everything work by using public transport has been exhausting and finally impossible,' she says. 'Going shopping by bus with a baby sounds so mundane, but everyone has to shop for food, and it's made difficult for anyone who isn't young, fit and babyless.'</p> <p>The car has made an enormous difference to Smith. \"We whizz to my current work in 10 minutes rather than it taking an hour and a half. I don't like the idea that I'm contributing to the awful traffic in Brighton when we go into town but, after a year of struggling, I just can't fight with buses and trains any more.'</p> <p>These are the everyday stories of people trying to make the best of Britain's creaking transport system. The impossibly complex arrangements, the lack of connections, the standing around for trains that never arrive, buses that are cancelled or, if they do set off, are doomed to sit in traffic jams because someone is digging up the road.</p> <p>Evans, Tranchell and Smith are important, because people like them are starting to blame the Government - and the Government knows it.</p> <p>New Labour has been making transport promises ever since it took office - but three years on, all the weary public gets is jams.</p> <p>At last, however, the Government has said it will act decisively. There will be big plans and 'multi-billions' of pounds, according to the Treasury. Just as health received a huge boost in the Budget, Ministers are now planning a similar injection of cash for transport in July.</p> <p>The ambition is huge: a transport revolution that will change the face of Britain. Look 10 years into the future and this is what the Government wants to see: double-decker trains whisking commuters into the cities; high-speed bus and tram routes; stations at major motorway junctions so that people can leave their cars and jump on to frequent, high-speed train links to the city.</p> <p>And more. The congested, creeping river of traffic that is the M6 at Birmingham will be tackled with road building and rapid public transport systems. The M25 will be the target of a taskforce that will work at plans to encourage people out of their cars and on to public transport. London will have its own tram network. A national scheme for cheaper travel for pensioners will reduce pressure on the roads. We will live in a country where the travel from A to B will not be the nightmare it too often is at present. Bus routes will be integrated with trains which will be integrated with roads.</p> <p>Sources told The Observer last week that the government would crack chronic congestion with new taxes on traffic that, in a policy triumph for transport over Treasury tight-fistedness, would be spent on gleaming new trains, trams, buses and cycle lanes. The private sector would bankroll the best projects and, with the biggest investment since Victorian times, Britain would be on the move again.</p> <p>The Observer first exposed the transport crisis last summer. Inertia, indecision, underfunding and Cabinet splits stifled the policies of Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who admitted it would take up to 10 years to solve. One year on and the good ideas have not gone away. And neither have the problems. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, want to lift transport out of the morass and, as with health, make the providers of the services - rail companies, bus firms and local authorities - take the strain. It will be the big summer message.</p> <p>The past year has been a disaster for railways and roads and a tangle of indecision for government. A report to be published tomorrow reveals that three-quarters of local authorities in England believe that underfunding of essential road maintenance is now putting safety at risk.</p> <p>Tomorrow's announcement of the results of the Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (Alarm) survey will show that councils paid out \u00a334 million last year to road users for accidents caused by crumbling and potholed streets, a 50 per cent increase on 1998.</p> <p>Some authorities said their road maintenance budgets were the lowest in real terms since 1974, and if funding did not increase they could only afford to resurface roads once every 78 years instead of the recommended 20 years.</p> <p>Britain spends less per head on transport than Germany, France, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and, according to the Automobile Association, has the worst road congestion in Europe. If the measures to reduce congestion in the Transport Bill, at present grinding its way through Parliament, are not rigorously implemented, the Government's own forecasts show there will be 35 per cent more traffic in 10 years' time than there was in 1996 and 65 per cent more congestion.</p> <p>Meanwhile, about 3,600 people are killed in road accidents every year and 43,000 are seriously injured. Almost 25,000 people die prematurely each year because of air pollution, much of which can be attributed to road vehicles.</p> <p>Railtrack, which is responsible for the condition of Britain's tracks and signals, has been attacked for its patchy investment record and poor stewardship of the network. The Government has also been criticised for failing to commit funds to automatic signalling and for being slow to get a grip on reshaping the railways to improve performance and investment.</p> <p>And all the while, as papers and clever documents are passed backwards and forwards between Ministers, the great British public struggles to overcome gridlock and shambles. Evans battling her way to and from her Anglesey home; Tranchell stuffed into another miserable commuter train in London, and Smith sitting in traffic jams around Brighton because local public transport isn't good enough. The Government knows these three are not alone.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Mair Evans's alarm clock lets her down tomorrow morning, she won't be getting her bus to work, because there isn't one that gets her there on time. Instead, she will have to walk the three miles from her village on Anglesey to her job as office administrator for the RSPB in its Bangor office, and hope it isn't raining. 'Every trip, whether to work, going shopping or even a day out at a weekend, ends up as a planning marathon,' she says. Starting at 5am is not unknown. A journey to Cardiff last month saw her take a cab to Bangor station, wait on a cold platform for the 6am train that took her on a four-hour detour into England, before dropping her at the Cardiff platform 20 stations later at just after 10 o'clock. Five hours to cover just over 200 miles. And then there's Sophie Tranchell, managing director of the Day Chocolate Company in London. She became so frustrated with five months of delays, missed connections and non-appearing buses that she moved the office so it was closer to where she lived. 'It can be a truly miserable experience travelling at rush hour from my station, Lewisham, into central London,' she says. 'Even now, I get on to the platform in the morning and sigh when the train turns up, literally stuffed full of very unhappy, stressed people, because there aren't enough carriages. At the old office, when I finally got into London, I ended up waiting for ridiculous amounts of time on tube platforms for the phantom Circle line.' And then there's Heather Smith, a support worker for adults with learning disabilities, who has to co-ordinate shift work on different sites around Brighton with caring for a young baby. After struggling for a year, Heather has given up on relying on buses and trains and bought a car. 'In the year since I had Conlan, trying to make everything work by using public transport has been exhausting and finally impossible,' she says. 'Going shopping by bus with a baby sounds so mundane, but everyone has to shop for food, and it's made difficult for anyone who isn't young, fit and babyless.' The car has made an enormous difference to Smith. \"We whizz to my current work in 10 minutes rather than it taking an hour and a half. I don't like the idea that I'm contributing to the awful traffic in Brighton when we go into town but, after a year of struggling, I just can't fight with buses and trains any more.' These are the everyday stories of people trying to make the best of Britain's creaking transport system. The impossibly complex arrangements, the lack of connections, the standing around for trains that never arrive, buses that are cancelled or, if they do set off, are doomed to sit in traffic jams because someone is digging up the road. Evans, Tranchell and Smith are important, because people like them are starting to blame the Government - and the Government knows it. New Labour has been making transport promises ever since it took office - but three years on, all the weary public gets is jams. At last, however, the Government has said it will act decisively. There will be big plans and 'multi-billions' of pounds, according to the Treasury. Just as health received a huge boost in the Budget, Ministers are now planning a similar injection of cash for transport in July. The ambition is huge: a transport revolution that will change the face of Britain. Look 10 years into the future and this is what the Government wants to see: double-decker trains whisking commuters into the cities; high-speed bus and tram routes; stations at major motorway junctions so that people can leave their cars and jump on to frequent, high-speed train links to the city. And more. The congested, creeping river of traffic that is the M6 at Birmingham will be tackled with road building and rapid public transport systems. The M25 will be the target of a taskforce that will work at plans to encourage people out of their cars and on to public transport. London will have its own tram network. A national scheme for cheaper travel for pensioners will reduce pressure on the roads. We will live in a country where the travel from A to B will not be the nightmare it too often is at present. Bus routes will be integrated with trains which will be integrated with roads. Sources told The Observer last week that the government would crack chronic congestion with new taxes on traffic that, in a policy triumph for transport over Treasury tight-fistedness, would be spent on gleaming new trains, trams, buses and cycle lanes. The private sector would bankroll the best projects and, with the biggest investment since Victorian times, Britain would be on the move again. The Observer first exposed the transport crisis last summer. Inertia, indecision, underfunding and Cabinet splits stifled the policies of Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who admitted it would take up to 10 years to solve. One year on and the good ideas have not gone away. And neither have the problems. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, want to lift transport out of the morass and, as with health, make the providers of the services - rail companies, bus firms and local authorities - take the strain. It will be the big summer message. The past year has been a disaster for railways and roads and a tangle of indecision for government. A report to be published tomorrow reveals that three-quarters of local authorities in England believe that underfunding of essential road maintenance is now putting safety at risk. Tomorrow's announcement of the results of the Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (Alarm) survey will show that councils paid out \u00a334 million last year to road users for accidents caused by crumbling and potholed streets, a 50 per cent increase on 1998. Some authorities said their road maintenance budgets were the lowest in real terms since 1974, and if funding did not increase they could only afford to resurface roads once every 78 years instead of the recommended 20 years. Britain spends less per head on transport than Germany, France, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and, according to the Automobile Association, has the worst road congestion in Europe. If the measures to reduce congestion in the Transport Bill, at present grinding its way through Parliament, are not rigorously implemented, the Government's own forecasts show there will be 35 per cent more traffic in 10 years' time than there was in 1996 and 65 per cent more congestion. Meanwhile, about 3,600 people are killed in road accidents every year and 43,000 are seriously injured. Almost 25,000 people die prematurely each year because of air pollution, much of which can be attributed to road vehicles. Railtrack, which is responsible for the condition of Britain's tracks and signals, has been attacked for its patchy investment record and poor stewardship of the network. The Government has also been criticised for failing to commit funds to automatic signalling and for being slow to get a grip on reshaping the railways to improve performance and investment. And all the while, as papers and clever documents are passed backwards and forwards between Ministers, the great British public struggles to overcome gridlock and shambles. Evans battling her way to and from her Anglesey home; Tranchell stuffed into another miserable commuter train in London, and Smith sitting in traffic jams around Brighton because local public transport isn't good enough. The Government knows these three are not alone.",

      "bodyText": "Queer As Folk, the Channel 4 series that provoked complaints from the British Broadcasting Standards Commission, is to be remade in America - and Christian groups across the country's Bible Belt are not relishing the prospect. The drama about young gay Mancunians will be reshot in New Jersey with a new cast and script. Fundamentalist and evangelical groups are already lobbying for the show's explicit sexual content to be toned down. Executives of Channel Four International met this weekend in New York's Russian Tea Rooms restaurant to seal the deal with Los Angeles-based Showtime television network. 'The Showtime slogan is \"No Limits\",' said Nicola Shindler, producer of the British show, which was made by Red Productions. 'So we are very hopeful that the new show will remain true to the original.' The American version will, however, have a much bigger budget. 'They were talking about as much as \u00a31million an episode, but that is much more common over there,' said Shindler. The new series will be cast with unknown actors and made by the Batman director Joel Schumacher who has assured the show's British creator, Russell T. Davies, that every attempt to stick to the original storylines will be made. He has repeatedly argued that the sex scenes were not necessarily what shocked audiences anyway. He said: 'There are no naked sex scenes in the second series, but I think it's more shocking when the two central characters go to bed after 16 years and don't have sex. 'Some people may also be shocked to see a boy of 15 having tea with his boyfriend, his mum and his sister.' But the American production team in-waiting has said it is prepared to face anti-gay lobbyists. 'The show will not be watered down,' Schumacher told the LA Times. On a US religious website, the evangelist pastor Connor Crawford called for Showtime to leave the show in Britain. Fans who have seen original episodes on satellite or cable channels called for tolerance. One of the series' biggest Internet defenders, a man who describes Manchester as 'a notoriously gay area just outside London', says Americans would be lucky to have their own version. The British series, starring Aidan Gillen, Craig Kelly and Denise Black, has already been sold to 13 other countries and is Channel 4's biggest selling video ever. No more shows will be made in this country because Davies was eager not to milk the format. 'I wouldn't mind going back to the characters in another 20 years or so,' he said, 'but I'll probably be dead by then.' News of the American deal is further evidence of the increasing interest in British television. US versions of formats developed here are topping ratings. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? leads this charge, but an NBC version of Granada's Cold Feet is airing and there are commitments to a second American series of Whose Line is it Anyway? hosted by Drew Carey on ABC and to develop scripts for both The Royle Family and Only Fools and Horses. Rock Scissors Paper is a version of Andrew Davies' sitcom Game On under consideration by Fox, re-written by Bill and Sheri Steinkiller, the husband-and-wife team who created Cheers. This change of name highlights one looming problem for Showtime. What will they call Queer As Folk? While the term 'queer' is used in some quarters, the saying 'There's nowt as queer as folk' has no currency at all.",

End, Schluss , no argument.</p> <p>This has proved an unpopular view. The Jewish Chronicle took the Lipstadt line: 'Merely to suggest the fact of the Holocaust... is somehow open to debate is obscene'. So did David Cesarani, Professor of Modern Jewish History at Southampton. He reproached the media for continuing to talk to Irving and ask him for his opinions. Most British commentators found this repugnant. They had no doubt the Holocaust happened. But in the old liberal way, they felt like fighting for a man's right to express views they found loathsome.</p> <p>They were also worried that the judgment could deter 'genuine' historical argument about the details of the Holocaust. The total of the victims, some of the methods and the genesis of the plan itself are all uncertain.

Again, Irving's defeat did nothing to support her. But the reporting of the trial seemed to some to imply an exclusiveness about Jewish victimhood. This disturbed both historians (such as Mark Mazower, author of Dark Continent: Europe in the Twentieth Century) and minorities who have themselves been subjected to genocide, like the Armenians. As Mazower said last week, more data have come to light in recent years which multiply the scale of great atrocities in the past. These include the death toll in King Leopold's Congo Free State, which may have reached 10 million, and the famine deaths caused by Mao's Great Leap Forward in China, now thought to number more than 20 million.</p> <p>The Irving trial again brought out the unique features of the Holocaust. The more Irving blustered about how unplanned the 'Final Solution' was, the more his own documents reminded an appalled court of its deliberate, industrialised character, its intention to eradicate an entire race.</p> <p>But an English libel court is for justice, not for history.

Then the medical team were forced out and beaten.</p> <p>The medics and patients were taken to Tolstoy Yurt, and dumped into a hole in the ground with no heating, no light and snow on the floor and kept there for six days without treatment. The wounded were repeatedly beaten and tortured. Five , including a paralysed boy, Mowladi Idrisov, 16, were killed in front of her.</p> <p>On the sixth day the medics were transferred to a 'filtration camp' at Chernokozovo, where five female nurses, including Khasuyeva, were separated from the men. The women were stripped and forced to dance in front of the Russian soldiers, who were constantly drunk.</p> <p>Khasuyeva has compiled a list of the 61 wounded who were arrested with the medical team.

      "bodyText": "The Russian government is being taken to the European Court of Human Rights by a Chechen nurse who saw five of her patients killed in front of her, and says 61 others have vanished. The case of Sasita Khasuyeva, 45, has been raised by London solicitor Gareth Peirce. The nurse claims that on 2 February a hospital convoy of three buses carrying white flags was attacked by Russian troops. 'The wounded were thrown from the buses and beaten on the spot,' Khasuyeva says. Then the medical team were forced out and beaten. The medics and patients were taken to Tolstoy Yurt, and dumped into a hole in the ground with no heating, no light and snow on the floor and kept there for six days without treatment. The wounded were repeatedly beaten and tortured. Five , including a paralysed boy, Mowladi Idrisov, 16, were killed in front of her. On the sixth day the medics were transferred to a 'filtration camp' at Chernokozovo, where five female nurses, including Khasuyeva, were separated from the men. The women were stripped and forced to dance in front of the Russian soldiers, who were constantly drunk. Khasuyeva has compiled a list of the 61 wounded who were arrested with the medical team. All have disappeared. The case before the Strasbourg court comes at a bad time for President Putin, Tony Blair's guest. Buckingham Palace declined to say whether the Queen would raise the question of the torture and killings with Putin when he visits her tomorrow. john.sweeney@observer.co.uk",

And almost every day the court is jolted by remarks tossed out as inconsequential: 'He never closed the curtains after the drive-by shooting' and 'The box contained letters my father regarded sentimentally because they were written by my grandfather from the penitentiary.'</p> <p>One witness, a manicurist who testified that one of the accused outlined the murder plot a week before the victim died, was castigated by the defence for fabricating evidence to help her father, who was serving life imprisonment without parole. Three other prosecution witnesses acknowledged they had prison records for drug dealing.</p> <p>On trial for murder are former stripper Sandy Murphy, 28, known as the Irish Venus, and her clandestine boyfriend, building contractor and tough guy Rick Tabish, 35. Their alleged victim was Horseshoe Casino boss and multi-millionaire Lonnie 'Ted' Binion, 55, found in September 1998 sprawled on the floor of the Las Vegas mansion he shared with Murphy, and dead from an apparent heroin overdose.</p> <p>Two days later, Tabish was arrested at 3am in the Nevada brothel town of Pahrump while digging up Binion's secret vault containing 23 tons of silver ingots worth $7 million (\u00a34.4m). Tabish, as the vault's original builder, said Binion had asked him to remove the treasure 'if anything happened' to him. When police examined the underground chamber it contained one silver dollar. Earlier this year 100lb of the bullion were found near Tabish's home in Montana.</p> <p>Yet police waited months before charging Murphy and Tabish with murdering Binion, a drug addict, by forcing heroin and a tranquilliser down his throat and smothering him when he didn't die. Prosecutors say the couple wanted to free Murphy from Binion, a beloved figure around Vegas, who beat her during their three-year affair. The cuckolding couple allegedly stole his millions to help Tabish out of financial trouble and because Binion was disinheriting Murphy.</p> <p>The two, who face life imprisonment, insist Binion's death was either suicide or an accidental overdose. For months they denied any romance, but in a pre-trial hearing the court camera caught them in a glance of such heated lust it would have peeled the varnish off the judge's bench. In the trial's opening statement the defence admitted the romance but failed to mention Tabish's wife and two children in Montana.</p> <p>The trial typifies the free-for-all state where brothels and gambling have been lawful for decades. Murphy has one of its top lawyers, John Momot, whose fees are paid by a mysterious 'Irish busi nessman' who also financed a defence opinion poll advertised on Las Vegas TV during jury breaks. The responses were intended for planning defence strategy. Viewers are split 50-50 over the verdict, not expected for weeks. The judge ordered future polls to be kept confidential.</p> <p>The case originates in Las Vegas's genesis in the late 1940s, when Irish-American mobster Benny Binion left Dallas just ahead of a murder allegation. He arrived with young Ted - and a suitcase with $2m - in Vegas, where gangster Bugsy Siegel had launched the Flamingo Casino. Benny killed at least two men in Vegas, but was never convicted.</p> <p>Ted loved gambling and was adept at running the Horseshoe, where no bet was refused. At 14 he was almost kidnapped and Benny's home had hidden corridors and a 'bomb-proof' barn.</p> <p>Ted inherited Benny's caution. His former wife Doris told the court Ted propped twin shotguns either side of the marital bed, 'one for each of us'. Their daughter Bonnie said Ted kept mountains of cash around the house, stashed in a boat, in the fridge, in bathroom cupboards and the rafters, amounting to up to $100,000. Everywhere in the mansion were guns. Binion also had a collection of gold coins, jewellery and diamonds, with an estimated value of $1m. After his death, the house was ransacked, allegedly by Murphy and Tabish.</p> <p>Murphy went into hysterics when she 'found' Binion dead and was taken to hospital. Yet 24 hours later she directed a videotape 'inventory' of the house, claiming Binion's family and lawyers had stripped it.</p> <p>Binion had fought Nevada's Gaming Board since 1987 when it removed his casino licence first for drugs, and later for consorting with 'undesirables' - mostly gangster Herbie 'Fat Herb' Blitzstein, who died of a bullet in the head in 1997. But, although Binion's sister took over his casino, half a dozen witnesses said he was optimistic and showed no suicidal tendencies.</p> <p>They said Binion was suspicious of Murphy and Tabish, who were 'tighter than a cheap suit'. Before he died he phoned his lawyer Jim Brown and told him: 'Take Sandy out of the will if she doesn't kill me tonight. If I'm dead you'll know what happened.' Earlier, Brown had appended a codicil adding the mansion to a legacy that included her Mercedes-Benz sports car and $300,000, yet when Brown heard of his old friend's death the next day he did not tell police about the call.</p> <p>In the world of Ted Binion and old Las Vegas that is not something one does.</p>",

One witness, a manicurist who testified that one of the accused outlined the murder plot a week before the victim died, was castigated by the defence for fabricating evidence to help her father, who was serving life imprisonment without parole. Three other prosecution witnesses acknowledged they had prison records for drug dealing. On trial for murder are former stripper Sandy Murphy, 28, known as the Irish Venus, and her clandestine boyfriend, building contractor and tough guy Rick Tabish, 35. Their alleged victim was Horseshoe Casino boss and multi-millionaire Lonnie 'Ted' Binion, 55, found in September 1998 sprawled on the floor of the Las Vegas mansion he shared with Murphy, and dead from an apparent heroin overdose. Two days later, Tabish was arrested at 3am in the Nevada brothel town of Pahrump while digging up Binion's secret vault containing 23 tons of silver ingots worth $7 million (\u00a34.4m). Tabish, as the vault's original builder, said Binion had asked him to remove the treasure 'if anything happened' to him. When police examined the underground chamber it contained one silver dollar. Earlier this year 100lb of the bullion were found near Tabish's home in Montana. Yet police waited months before charging Murphy and Tabish with murdering Binion, a drug addict, by forcing heroin and a tranquilliser down his throat and smothering him when he didn't die. Prosecutors say the couple wanted to free Murphy from Binion, a beloved figure around Vegas, who beat her during their three-year affair. The cuckolding couple allegedly stole his millions to help Tabish out of financial trouble and because Binion was disinheriting Murphy. The two, who face life imprisonment, insist Binion's death was either suicide or an accidental overdose. For months they denied any romance, but in a pre-trial hearing the court camera caught them in a glance of such heated lust it would have peeled the varnish off the judge's bench. In the trial's opening statement the defence admitted the romance but failed to mention Tabish's wife and two children in Montana. The trial typifies the free-for-all state where brothels and gambling have been lawful for decades. Murphy has one of its top lawyers, John Momot, whose fees are paid by a mysterious 'Irish busi nessman' who also financed a defence opinion poll advertised on Las Vegas TV during jury breaks. The responses were intended for planning defence strategy. Viewers are split 50-50 over the verdict, not expected for weeks. The judge ordered future polls to be kept confidential. The case originates in Las Vegas's genesis in the late 1940s, when Irish-American mobster Benny Binion left Dallas just ahead of a murder allegation. He arrived with young Ted - and a suitcase with $2m - in Vegas, where gangster Bugsy Siegel had launched the Flamingo Casino. Benny killed at least two men in Vegas, but was never convicted. Ted loved gambling and was adept at running the Horseshoe, where no bet was refused. At 14 he was almost kidnapped and Benny's home had hidden corridors and a 'bomb-proof' barn. Ted inherited Benny's caution. His former wife Doris told the court Ted propped twin shotguns either side of the marital bed, 'one for each of us'. Their daughter Bonnie said Ted kept mountains of cash around the house, stashed in a boat, in the fridge, in bathroom cupboards and the rafters, amounting to up to $100,000. Everywhere in the mansion were guns. Binion also had a collection of gold coins, jewellery and diamonds, with an estimated value of $1m. After his death, the house was ransacked, allegedly by Murphy and Tabish. Murphy went into hysterics when she 'found' Binion dead and was taken to hospital. Yet 24 hours later she directed a videotape 'inventory' of the house, claiming Binion's family and lawyers had stripped it. Binion had fought Nevada's Gaming Board since 1987 when it removed his casino licence first for drugs, and later for consorting with 'undesirables' - mostly gangster Herbie 'Fat Herb' Blitzstein, who died of a bullet in the head in 1997. But, although Binion's sister took over his casino, half a dozen witnesses said he was optimistic and showed no suicidal tendencies. They said Binion was suspicious of Murphy and Tabish, who were 'tighter than a cheap suit'. Before he died he phoned his lawyer Jim Brown and told him: 'Take Sandy out of the will if she doesn't kill me tonight. If I'm dead you'll know what happened.' Earlier, Brown had appended a codicil adding the mansion to a legacy that included her Mercedes-Benz sports car and $300,000, yet when Brown heard of his old friend's death the next day he did not tell police about the call. In the world of Ted Binion and old Las Vegas that is not something one does.",

That and the fact that it carries with it a series of obvious supplementaries: How much did they win? (\u00a3900,000); Have they retired? (Yes); Did they finish the work on your flat? (No). It's a sentence that might make a decent opening to a short story by Raymond Carver. Unfortunately, in my case, it's also a sentence which is true - and, as with Raymond Carver, when things begin badly, they only get worse. </p> <p> It all seemed to start innocently enough. There was a small, second bathroom on a half landing in our north London flat, and we wanted to convert it to a shower room. We bought some Starck-esque fixtures and a dozen boxes of mosaic tiles and, with a torn page from an old Elle Decoration in my back pocket, I called some builders to come in and quote.

But eventually a Federation father and a Federation son, Steve and Kevin, agreed to do the work with an iron handshake; we settled on a start date, 6 December. 'It'll take about 10 days,' Steve said confidently. 'We'll be long gone by Christmas.' </p> <p> On Christmas Eve, I was standing on a joist in the dark catching water in a baby's plastic bath and trying to raise Steve on his mobile. Before knocking off for the holiday fortnight and after having ripped the old bathroom out (but before putting the new one in), Steve and Kevin had discovered a leak in the roof.

A week later, the scaffolding arrived.

Steve and Kevin couldn't wait around for the roofers to finish their tea forever, though, so by now they were on other jobs. (It is, of course, a golden rule of the Federation that once a builder has started a job, he can't morally tear himself away from it. The only exception to this rule is if it's your job he's started.) </p> <p>A new series of arrival dates thus came and went, and then one Sunday evening in February, Steve, with whom I was now enjoying a daily conversation, rang to share his good news: 'We won't be coming in tomorrow, I'm afraid, Tim, you see we have to go and collect this cheque' I held the phone away from my ear. When I put it back, Steve was talking in Oxymoron: 'reliable subcontractors,' he said, and 'quality workmanship'.</p> <p> I'm not sure if anyone has ever investigated the possibility of a Quantity Theory of Good Fortune, the proposition that for every windfall there is equal but opposite storm damage in the near vicinity, but perhaps it's worth looking into. For most of the rest of the month, a series of reliable sub-contractors arrived with the express purpose of 'inspecting the job', all six square yards of it.</p> <p>At the beginning of March a sub-contracted carpenter broke with the pack and turned up to replace a joist that had been water damaged from the leak. The next day, a sub-contracted plumber arrived, stood on the new joist and brought down the entire ceiling, somewhat to the consternation of my wife and baby, who had just passed underneath. For a few seconds the plumber apparently occupied two floors of the flat; his legs whirling above the stairs, his torso still in the bathroom covered in dust and mouthing obscenities, like a character in a Samuel Beckett play.</p> <p> In some ways this seemed like an omen, because from then on the progress of the bathroom took on the character of the Irishman's prose. 'It can't go on,' I thought. 'It must go on. It won't go on.' It went on. For a while, in place of a new bathroom we had a new hole in the ceiling to add to the new pile of rubble and assorted debris outside the (absent) bathroom door. The hole was at the top of the stairs and as we walked up, our six-month-old baby would stare up into the void wide-eyed, as if assailed with Chicken Licken visions, and then she'd look at us, alarmed, as if to say, 'I think I preferred it as it was' </p> <p> Towards the end of March, Steve and Kevin came by with pictures of their new Jags and talk of Caribbean holidays, and a couple of days later, the plasterers arrived; or at least the sub-sub-contracted plasterers arrived (the sub-sub-contracted plasterer had, I was told, fittingly, admitted himself to a drying-out clinic the previous week). My suspicions should, of course, have been alerted by their entrance carrying bicycle wheels and their opening greeting: 'Have you got a hammer, mate?' </p> <p> But by now a wild desperation to move things forward had overtaken any real sense of discrimination. I thought I'd leave them to it for a couple of hours. I returned to discover that they had made a start at plastering the stair carpet without yet getting to the walls.

Not on site was Michelle, who came armed with a stubborn catchphrase: 'There's no point in yelling at me,' she would say. 'I'm only the messenger.' </p> <p> Over the next few weeks the messages Michelle delivered were of two kinds: there was the promise of immediate action: 'You've been messed around; we'll be done by Friday, no question'; and there was the subsequent extraordinary explanation of inaction: the plumber who fell down the stairs; the sub-sub-sub-contracted plasterer whose girlfriend contracted malaria.</p> <p>There are only a limited number of ways of making builders build.

      "byline": "Tamsin Blanchard",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Five minutes to 11, and Michael Young and his Icelandic wife, Katrin Petursdottir, are leaving the Rex, Reykjavik's sleekest and shiniest restaurant. They step out into the cold night, past a typical Friday night drunken brawl, and walk briskly a few doors up the hill to the Astro bar. It is the opening of a new Reykjavik night-time landmark. Young walks through the door, trying to ignore the queue gathering outside. He is a little nervous. Some of the furniture is still held in customs, the toilets are barely finished and - he sniffs the fumes in the air - the paint isn't dry yet. </p> <p> But what a glorious shade of green it is: the kind of souped-up, pistachio green you associate with 50s ice-cream parlours. And just to set the teeth on edge is a stripe of bright, beefy red, a motif that outlines the club's doorways and cloakroom, as though Young has drawn them with a giant red marker. You know how these designers are - they don't like things to be too tasteful. They like things to jar a little. A single, bold red stripe marks the floor, a few yards short of the bar. 'It's the thin red line,' he says. 'There's no going back once you've crossed it.'</p> <p> The moulded, loopy bar itself has Michael Young's fingerprints all over it. Not literally, of course. That would be enough to send him right over the edge. The furniture designer has a permanent hang-dog look at the best of times. As he himself admits, he worries too much. But he agrees, the sticky paint surfaces will have to do.</p> <p> Time up. It's 11 o'clock, and the moment is here to unveil the world's first total Michael Young experience. This is his space, from the light fittings, his brand new prototype armchair, and the vibrating colour scheme to the Star Trek-modern uniforms of the bar staff (designed by Katrin, along with the graphics for the invite). If you had asked someone 30 years ago to describe an interior for the year 2020, it would have looked something like Astro. 'This is my playground - my dream project,' he says. 'Most bars are dreary places. There aren't many bars designed purposefully for entertainment. I wanted to create an environment for people to escape to and forget their week.' </p> <p> It is a little like entering a spaceship - there are these strange white spiky-looking lights suspended from the ceiling; the surface of the bar feels as though it is made from some material from another planet; and slap-bang in the middle is a hollow crater, with five round red pods arranged within it, like huge buttons waiting for some giant alien to come and push them. The 'sticklights' are, in fact, Young's latest design for the West London-based company Eurolounge. They are made from the same plastic that is used for motorway cones. The bar is made from Corian, a man-made stone composite that has been carved by hand until it is perfectly smooth and rounded, just the way he likes it. And the strange pods in the crater are Young's celebrated Smarty cushions, which he says are like toys. The sunken structure was engineered by the same people who built Reykjavik's recently revamped Blue Lagoon, the hyper-real, turquoise-blue steaming volcanic waters that have become Iceland's star tourist attraction. The idea was to create a dry version of a hot tub. In Iceland, they are something of a national institution. Young says he takes to the hot tub when he gets bored or disillusioned, or when he needs time to think. During the week, friends meet in their local tub for a soak and a gossip, much as the Brits might meet up for a few pints in the pub after work. This is a combination of the two. </p> <p>Upstairs, there is another bar, with lots of space for dancing and a floor that lights up in multi-colours, specially designed by lighting innovator Jeremy Lord. There's a VIP room, too, that basks in the glow of red light, which has a heat sensor and intensifies the more people there are in the room. The furniture is all white, just as Young likes it, so you can see the design in all its purity.</p> <p> In the chaos of Astro's opening night, however, Young seems rooted to his Smarty for much of the night as the crowds sweep around the place, stampeding over the furniture, hanging off the lights, spilling their drinks and stubbing out their cigarettes. He seems a little bemused and out of place in his own environment, partly, perhaps, because he is not used to seeing his work used quite so brutally. But this is a nightclub, and the Icelanders know how to party. Friday night in Reykjavik is not a place for the faint-hearted. It's like New Year's Eve, Valentine's Night, 10 hen parties, and Arsenal winning the double all at the same time. The first time he was left on his own in his newly adopted town, Young recalls wandering out for a drink and being set upon by a gang of drunken teenagers, who beat him up just for the sheer, lager-sodden fun of it. And he's a tall bloke. From Sunderland. </p> <p>Young and Petursdottir live and work in the centre of town, and run around in a Jeep with a mini Union Jack propped on the dashboard. It appeals to Young's innocent sense of humour. It would be impossible for Iceland not to have an effect on Young's work. 'I moved here for the obscurity of it,' he says. He likes the isolation and the purity of the place, the fact that wherever you look you can see snow-capped mountains. He also loves the Icelandic horses, which look as though they have been speeded up on film because their legs are too short for their bodies, and the vast factory down at the docks, where fishing nets are made by hand in hundreds of bright and cheery colours. The docks themselves, with their huge, brightly painted trawlers and disused whaler, are a favourite hunting ground for Young. It is places like this where great ideas are born. 'I've never been inspired by looking at design,' he insists.</p> <p> Like Bj\u00f6rk, who recently moved back to her home town, and Blur's Damon Albarn, who has an apartment and a part-share in Reykjavik's most talked-about drinking den, Young lives in the centre of town. He's lived there for more than 18 months, after marrying Petursdottir on a tiny, windswept island off the mainland. She's a designer, too. They met in London while Young was becoming known for the child-like simplicity of his designs - the MY16 (the Smarty) or MY03, (the magazine sofa that doubles as a magazine rack). </p> <p> Since being in Iceland, Young has set up another branch of his company, in partnership with his wife. It's called Young &amp; Beautiful, and one of their first ventures was the comical-sounding puffin soup (he is fascinated by the creatures, which in Iceland are something of a delicacy. The meat, apparently, tastes like a cross between chicken and fish.) Production had to be curtailed; the responsibility of running a slaughterhouse suddenly didn't have quite the same appeal for the couple. Typically, the operation was always more about packaging than content anyway. </p> <p> Another Young &amp; Beautiful venture is a small selection of jewellery made by the Icelandic silversmith, Snorri Sigurdsson, under the label s.m.a.k. The silver ring is based on the couple's wedding ring, which in turn is based on the curvy rectangular shape of his magazine sofa. There are six collections by other designers in progress, including a necklace by the British furniture maestro Michael Marriott. Eventually, Young says he would like his ring to be made in plastic, 'in hundreds of different colours'.</p> <p> Like most product designers, Young dreams of a world in which his furniture, jewellery, lights and glasses are widely available and accessibly priced. This week, he is at the Milan Furniture Fair, presenting his new products for the Italian manufacturer Magis. There's a tray on legs - the sort of bed tray you might imagine the Jetsons using to serve up sci-fi food at the Jetson Hospital. There's a flat, square floor light, with a mini volcano of light erupting from a crater within it. And two tables - one that's just simple moulded plastic, and another with globular trestle legs and a glass top. 'They're going to be cheap,' he enthuses. And if they are, then surely no self-respecting modern home should be without at least one of them.</p> <p> Young was born in Sunderland in 1966, and confesses that he was a bit of an academic failure. 'I was crap at school,' he says. 'The teachers told my parents there was no hope for me. That just drove me to prove I could do something.' So he got himself on to the furniture and product design degree course at Kingston University, and found work at Tom Dixon's Space studio in London's Notting Hill. </p> <p> By day he worked, and then after hours he would play to his heart's content, using up Dixon's scraps for his own experiments. 'I had really just started learning about shapes,' he writes in the design source book We Like This! Michael Young, published by Black Dog last year. 'The way the Smarty was born was through my getting a huge block of foam... I put this massive metal bolt through the centre of it and attached it to the end of a lathe - the whole machine would be shaking up and down. I then cut at it with a circular saw blade, which was about 1ft in diameter. I wrapped a cardboard box around my stomach, taped it to myself and cut into the foam with this really dangerous blade. Of course, I didn't know what it was going to be exactly... but it turned out to be one of the greatest accidents in my life.' </p> <p> The Smarty became the basis for Young's expansion as a designer in his own right. It was eventually put into production in 1998 by the Italian manufacturer Cappellini, and has become an international design classic. In the world of furniture, the designer is paid a percentage on every piece sold. 'If you've got 40 products on the market then you can retire,' he says. Or you do as Philippe Starck does - take more risks and get richer.</p> <p> Starck once turned up at the young designer's London studio. There had been a call beforehand to say he was coming, but Young didn't realise it would be the man himself. The eccentric Frenchman arrived - on a moped - inspected Young's work and then left again, as suddenly as he arrived. For a designer, this was like having the Queen pop in for an impromptu tea. 'I guess Starck has broken down all the traditional design values,' says Young. 'He's made a mockery of them, and that's fantastic. He's paved the way for people like me.' Young still has a way to go, but there seems little doubt that he will get there. 'I have curiosity and determination,' he says. 'I do my things, and I will do them till I die.' He is like an icebreaker at full steam.</p> <p> The day after the launch party, Young is back at Astro assessing the damage. He had sneaked off early the night before. Now the place looks like it needs a new lick of paint. You can see the imprints of people's bottoms where they sat on the paintwork. But Young's perma-frown just sets a little deeper.

It's a virtual world, in conjunction with other Icelandic artists, scheduled to come alive at the end of May. @ is a world without the confines of straight walls, fixed floors and paint that doesn't dry. 'It'll be a colourful grid, with any shape that comes out of the ground,' says Young.

      "bodyText": "Five minutes to 11, and Michael Young and his Icelandic wife, Katrin Petursdottir, are leaving the Rex, Reykjavik's sleekest and shiniest restaurant. They step out into the cold night, past a typical Friday night drunken brawl, and walk briskly a few doors up the hill to the Astro bar. It is the opening of a new Reykjavik night-time landmark. Young walks through the door, trying to ignore the queue gathering outside. He is a little nervous. Some of the furniture is still held in customs, the toilets are barely finished and - he sniffs the fumes in the air - the paint isn't dry yet. But what a glorious shade of green it is: the kind of souped-up, pistachio green you associate with 50s ice-cream parlours. And just to set the teeth on edge is a stripe of bright, beefy red, a motif that outlines the club's doorways and cloakroom, as though Young has drawn them with a giant red marker. You know how these designers are - they don't like things to be too tasteful. They like things to jar a little. A single, bold red stripe marks the floor, a few yards short of the bar. 'It's the thin red line,' he says. 'There's no going back once you've crossed it.' The moulded, loopy bar itself has Michael Young's fingerprints all over it. Not literally, of course. That would be enough to send him right over the edge. The furniture designer has a permanent hang-dog look at the best of times. As he himself admits, he worries too much. But he agrees, the sticky paint surfaces will have to do. Time up. It's 11 o'clock, and the moment is here to unveil the world's first total Michael Young experience. This is his space, from the light fittings, his brand new prototype armchair, and the vibrating colour scheme to the Star Trek-modern uniforms of the bar staff (designed by Katrin, along with the graphics for the invite). If you had asked someone 30 years ago to describe an interior for the year 2020, it would have looked something like Astro. 'This is my playground - my dream project,' he says. 'Most bars are dreary places. There aren't many bars designed purposefully for entertainment. I wanted to create an environment for people to escape to and forget their week.' It is a little like entering a spaceship - there are these strange white spiky-looking lights suspended from the ceiling; the surface of the bar feels as though it is made from some material from another planet; and slap-bang in the middle is a hollow crater, with five round red pods arranged within it, like huge buttons waiting for some giant alien to come and push them. The 'sticklights' are, in fact, Young's latest design for the West London-based company Eurolounge. They are made from the same plastic that is used for motorway cones. The bar is made from Corian, a man-made stone composite that has been carved by hand until it is perfectly smooth and rounded, just the way he likes it. And the strange pods in the crater are Young's celebrated Smarty cushions, which he says are like toys. The sunken structure was engineered by the same people who built Reykjavik's recently revamped Blue Lagoon, the hyper-real, turquoise-blue steaming volcanic waters that have become Iceland's star tourist attraction. The idea was to create a dry version of a hot tub. In Iceland, they are something of a national institution. Young says he takes to the hot tub when he gets bored or disillusioned, or when he needs time to think. During the week, friends meet in their local tub for a soak and a gossip, much as the Brits might meet up for a few pints in the pub after work. This is a combination of the two. Upstairs, there is another bar, with lots of space for dancing and a floor that lights up in multi-colours, specially designed by lighting innovator Jeremy Lord. There's a VIP room, too, that basks in the glow of red light, which has a heat sensor and intensifies the more people there are in the room. The furniture is all white, just as Young likes it, so you can see the design in all its purity. In the chaos of Astro's opening night, however, Young seems rooted to his Smarty for much of the night as the crowds sweep around the place, stampeding over the furniture, hanging off the lights, spilling their drinks and stubbing out their cigarettes. He seems a little bemused and out of place in his own environment, partly, perhaps, because he is not used to seeing his work used quite so brutally. But this is a nightclub, and the Icelanders know how to party. Friday night in Reykjavik is not a place for the faint-hearted. It's like New Year's Eve, Valentine's Night, 10 hen parties, and Arsenal winning the double all at the same time. The first time he was left on his own in his newly adopted town, Young recalls wandering out for a drink and being set upon by a gang of drunken teenagers, who beat him up just for the sheer, lager-sodden fun of it. And he's a tall bloke. From Sunderland. Young and Petursdottir live and work in the centre of town, and run around in a Jeep with a mini Union Jack propped on the dashboard. It appeals to Young's innocent sense of humour. It would be impossible for Iceland not to have an effect on Young's work. 'I moved here for the obscurity of it,' he says. He likes the isolation and the purity of the place, the fact that wherever you look you can see snow-capped mountains. He also loves the Icelandic horses, which look as though they have been speeded up on film because their legs are too short for their bodies, and the vast factory down at the docks, where fishing nets are made by hand in hundreds of bright and cheery colours. The docks themselves, with their huge, brightly painted trawlers and disused whaler, are a favourite hunting ground for Young. It is places like this where great ideas are born. 'I've never been inspired by looking at design,' he insists. Like Bj\u00f6rk, who recently moved back to her home town, and Blur's Damon Albarn, who has an apartment and a part-share in Reykjavik's most talked-about drinking den, Young lives in the centre of town. He's lived there for more than 18 months, after marrying Petursdottir on a tiny, windswept island off the mainland. She's a designer, too. They met in London while Young was becoming known for the child-like simplicity of his designs - the MY16 (the Smarty) or MY03, (the magazine sofa that doubles as a magazine rack). Since being in Iceland, Young has set up another branch of his company, in partnership with his wife. It's called Young &amp; Beautiful, and one of their first ventures was the comical-sounding puffin soup (he is fascinated by the creatures, which in Iceland are something of a delicacy. The meat, apparently, tastes like a cross between chicken and fish.) Production had to be curtailed; the responsibility of running a slaughterhouse suddenly didn't have quite the same appeal for the couple. Typically, the operation was always more about packaging than content anyway. Another Young &amp; Beautiful venture is a small selection of jewellery made by the Icelandic silversmith, Snorri Sigurdsson, under the label s.m.a.k. The silver ring is based on the couple's wedding ring, which in turn is based on the curvy rectangular shape of his magazine sofa. There are six collections by other designers in progress, including a necklace by the British furniture maestro Michael Marriott. Eventually, Young says he would like his ring to be made in plastic, 'in hundreds of different colours'. Like most product designers, Young dreams of a world in which his furniture, jewellery, lights and glasses are widely available and accessibly priced. This week, he is at the Milan Furniture Fair, presenting his new products for the Italian manufacturer Magis. There's a tray on legs - the sort of bed tray you might imagine the Jetsons using to serve up sci-fi food at the Jetson Hospital. There's a flat, square floor light, with a mini volcano of light erupting from a crater within it. And two tables - one that's just simple moulded plastic, and another with globular trestle legs and a glass top. 'They're going to be cheap,' he enthuses. And if they are, then surely no self-respecting modern home should be without at least one of them. Young was born in Sunderland in 1966, and confesses that he was a bit of an academic failure. 'I was crap at school,' he says. 'The teachers told my parents there was no hope for me. That just drove me to prove I could do something.' So he got himself on to the furniture and product design degree course at Kingston University, and found work at Tom Dixon's Space studio in London's Notting Hill. By day he worked, and then after hours he would play to his heart's content, using up Dixon's scraps for his own experiments. 'I had really just started learning about shapes,' he writes in the design source book We Like This! Michael Young, published by Black Dog last year. 'The way the Smarty was born was through my getting a huge block of foam... I put this massive metal bolt through the centre of it and attached it to the end of a lathe - the whole machine would be shaking up and down. I then cut at it with a circular saw blade, which was about 1ft in diameter. I wrapped a cardboard box around my stomach, taped it to myself and cut into the foam with this really dangerous blade. Of course, I didn't know what it was going to be exactly... but it turned out to be one of the greatest accidents in my life.' The Smarty became the basis for Young's expansion as a designer in his own right. It was eventually put into production in 1998 by the Italian manufacturer Cappellini, and has become an international design classic. In the world of furniture, the designer is paid a percentage on every piece sold. 'If you've got 40 products on the market then you can retire,' he says. Or you do as Philippe Starck does - take more risks and get richer. Starck once turned up at the young designer's London studio. There had been a call beforehand to say he was coming, but Young didn't realise it would be the man himself. The eccentric Frenchman arrived - on a moped - inspected Young's work and then left again, as suddenly as he arrived. For a designer, this was like having the Queen pop in for an impromptu tea. 'I guess Starck has broken down all the traditional design values,' says Young. 'He's made a mockery of them, and that's fantastic. He's paved the way for people like me.' Young still has a way to go, but there seems little doubt that he will get there. 'I have curiosity and determination,' he says. 'I do my things, and I will do them till I die.' He is like an icebreaker at full steam. The day after the launch party, Young is back at Astro assessing the damage. He had sneaked off early the night before. Now the place looks like it needs a new lick of paint. You can see the imprints of people's bottoms where they sat on the paintwork. But Young's perma-frown just sets a little deeper.

So I knew of him long before I met him because he was my gateway to the world of rabbinic learning.</p> <p> Rabbi Steinsaltz always stays with me when he's in London, which is two or three times a year, and he always says something that lifts my spirits. When we meet up, we tell each other stories - we learn to laugh at our problems. And so we live from encounter to encounter, as Adin is one of those people who perhaps despite, or perhaps because, he is part of another very complicated Jewish community in Israel. He sees very far and very deeply into the problems of this community, and so always manages to say something that I needed to hear in order to have the strength to write the next chapter or fight the next battle. </p> <p>The relationship is very simple. The story's told of a great Hasidic master, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, who one year foresaw that the harvest would be infected and whoever would eat it would go mad, and Rabbi Nachman said to his disciple, 'What shall we do? If we eat it, we'll go mad, but if we don't eat it, we will fail to share in the suffering of our community.' So they decided they would eat of the grain but each one would put a mark on the forehead of the other so that while everyone else was mad, at least the two of them would know they were mad. And that is the relationship between Rabbi Steinsaltz and myself; knowing we're both mad keeps us sane.</p> <p> It was the encounter with another remarkable person, Rabbi Lubavitcher, who set me on this journey to becoming a rabbi.

He's also a role model of how one can be very much in the heart of Jewish life and Jewish study, and yet preserve your integrity intellectually and ethically. </p> <p> The word adin is the nearest Hebrew gets to a particular kind of gentleness, which is Adin's very great characteristic. Adin is both a mystical and a poetical person, and poetic spirits are relatively rare in contemporary Judaism. And to hear Rabbi Steinsaltz speak is to hear a poetic stream of consciousness.

They all have a traditional 'Mollycroft' roof (a strip of glazed vents under a raised canopy) and a decorated 'belly box' (a lock-up storage unit slung below the chassis), but each has been produced to order by one of a number of specialist makers.

The Vosper - 30ft of 'late utility Art Deco style' with a half-ton marble fireplace and a tiny bedroom at either end of the living room - is ostensibly John's domain (his name, at least, is on the door). But the van also accommodates Rose's typically teenage bedroom (all boy bands, soft toys and cute pictures of Rottweilers) and, in the summer months, when Anna's Brayshaw is left behind, it becomes Mum and Dad Carter's main living space.</p> <p>Anna's Brayshaw, her 'Palace on Wheels', is far too precious to travel, she explains. And I see what she means when I remove my shoes and step inside. This is the Sistine Chapel of living vans: wall-to-wall mahogany joinery, curved-glass cabinets, etched mirrors, brass fittings, glass lamps and ornately painted ceiling panels featuring gilded scrolls, a trellis of roses and the odd butterfly against a pale blue sky. In common with much of the Carter collection, it didn't always look this good.</p> <p>The ceiling, for a start, was badly damaged. The whole surface was covered in sticky brown toffee which, according to Anna, was caused by a former owner, who had stockpiled candy-floss sugar during a shortage and then had an accident with a heater. After five weeks of scrubbing the panels clean with paper and meths, Anna used her artistic talent (she is the Carters resident fairground artist) to restore some of the decorative paintwork and reinstate the melted shellac varnish.</p> <p>Meticulous attention to detail is clearly a family trait and, in all, the restoration of the Carter vans must amount to years of hard labour. Indeed, I was unable to see the inside of Zed's gleaming Vosper because he was in the midst of repairing its leaded bay windows.

It's not what you'd expect of a young man in oil-stained overalls, but his living van, he explains, is his private refuge - an escape from the world of whirling Chair-o-planes, hooplahs and shooters, of organ music, engines and Carter family business. 'When I step outside, I'm at work,' he says. 'In here, I can be me.'</p> <p>That said, he is still, effectively, living at home - dependent on big brothers or parents for baths and hot food. 'I've got a sink,' he says proudly.

'The other disadvantage of this wagon is that it's like a corridor,' adds Joby. 'If you've got two people in here, it's full up. Four people, and it's almost a party.' When he first moved in, he invited 18 people to a 'wagon warming' - it was a case of packing them in like rush-hour commuters on a Bakerloo line tube.</p> <p>'What I wouldn't do for two sofas opposite each other,' sighs Joby. 'But apart from more room, there's nothing that other people have got that I haven't got or could have.

In a letter tendering his resignation as assistant to President Omar al-Bashir, he said the government was interested only in divide and rule - not in peace. Machar's defection prompted a new government push to depopulate the oil-producing areas, inhabited largely by Machar's own Nuer tribespeople.</p> <p>Meding Yieth, a Nuer from Rik village near the Heglig oilfield north of Bentiu, witnessed a government attack that razed Rik last month. 'They burned the entire village and shot all males older than 15 or 16,' he said. 'Women and children fled towards Bentiu. Some were caught and taken in cars to Bentiu. Others drowned while being chased across the Bahr el Ghazal river [on Bentiu's northern edge].'</p> <p>Yieth escaped across Bentiu and reached the village of Guk a day's walk south. Here, he said, he hid in a luac - a thatched byre - belonging to a friend called Chol Riak. Then the army reached Guk.</p> <p>'I saw soldiers questioning Chol Riak,' he said. 'They nailed his wife and three young children to a tree and hit the children with sticks to make him talk. They they cut their throats. They sliced off Chol's ears and hammered nails into his temples. He was a trader; he knew nothing of the SPLA.'</p> <p>Yieth said the family of a second friend, Chol Bol, was similarly slaughtered. The husband was killed with nails, his wife was shot dead and their seven children had their throats cut. Old people who were unable to flee were herded into a cattle pen and burned alive with their animals. Another southerner who made it to Pagerau, Kolang Yar, said his sister and brother-in-law had been killed in an attack on Roub Nyagai, near the Unity oilfield. His mother and brother fled, but were surrounded and slaughtered. Only he escaped.</p> <p>'I saw eight villages attacked that day,' he said. 'So many people were killed - with guns and with gunships. All the soldiers wore the same uniforms. I saw no black person among them, only red [a word used by southerners to describe Arabs].'</p> <p>Dhieu Paul, an SPLA relief official in Pagerau, said the number of displaced reaching Yirol county had doubled since the beginning of March. 'They are arriving in terrible condition, sometimes 100 to 200 a day,' he said. 'The children especially are exhausted and ill. Many are suffering from malaria and diarrhoea. All are starved.'</p> <p>Khartoum seven months ago imposed a ban on all UN relief flights into the region. Paul Savage, Christian Aid's senior field officer in southern Sudan, said: 'Foreign investors and foreign workers are being invited into the oil fields, but relief is being denied to people forced from their homes to secure that oil.'</p> <p>In London last week, non-governmental organisations held a meeting with BP Amoco and urged it to sever links with a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation in which it has acquired a $570 million stake. They argued that the subsidiary, PetroChina, was linked to CNPC 'like a Siamese twin'; BP insisted there was a 'fire wall' between the two.</p> <p>'We asked BP Amoco not to invest in PetroChina while CNPC remains a partner in the Greater Nile project,' a source at the meeting told The Observer. 'BP accepted the investment linkages were strong - and then proceeded to take the \"constructive engagement\" line.'</p> <p>David Rice, director of BP's Policy Unit, admitted oil was responsible for human rights abuses in Sudan and was financing the war against the South. But the BP delegation said the company was committed to increasing its stake in PetroChina to $1 billion.</p> <p>Sudan is an attractive investment prospect because of its low-cost, high-quality reserves, estimated at more than 800 million barrels. Production stands at more than 200,000 barrels a day.</p> <p>Human rights groups refute BP's 'fire wall' defence and demand the severance of BP's Chinese connection.</p> <p>'In buying into PetroChina, BP is investing in oil in Sudan and has to take responsibility for human rights abuses in the area,' says Annetta Weber of Amnesty International.</p>",

In a letter tendering his resignation as assistant to President Omar al-Bashir, he said the government was interested only in divide and rule - not in peace. Machar's defection prompted a new government push to depopulate the oil-producing areas, inhabited largely by Machar's own Nuer tribespeople. Meding Yieth, a Nuer from Rik village near the Heglig oilfield north of Bentiu, witnessed a government attack that razed Rik last month. 'They burned the entire village and shot all males older than 15 or 16,' he said. 'Women and children fled towards Bentiu. Some were caught and taken in cars to Bentiu. Others drowned while being chased across the Bahr el Ghazal river [on Bentiu's northern edge].' Yieth escaped across Bentiu and reached the village of Guk a day's walk south. Here, he said, he hid in a luac - a thatched byre - belonging to a friend called Chol Riak. Then the army reached Guk. 'I saw soldiers questioning Chol Riak,' he said. 'They nailed his wife and three young children to a tree and hit the children with sticks to make him talk. They they cut their throats. They sliced off Chol's ears and hammered nails into his temples. He was a trader; he knew nothing of the SPLA.' Yieth said the family of a second friend, Chol Bol, was similarly slaughtered. The husband was killed with nails, his wife was shot dead and their seven children had their throats cut. Old people who were unable to flee were herded into a cattle pen and burned alive with their animals. Another southerner who made it to Pagerau, Kolang Yar, said his sister and brother-in-law had been killed in an attack on Roub Nyagai, near the Unity oilfield. His mother and brother fled, but were surrounded and slaughtered. Only he escaped. 'I saw eight villages attacked that day,' he said. 'So many people were killed - with guns and with gunships. All the soldiers wore the same uniforms. I saw no black person among them, only red [a word used by southerners to describe Arabs].' Dhieu Paul, an SPLA relief official in Pagerau, said the number of displaced reaching Yirol county had doubled since the beginning of March. 'They are arriving in terrible condition, sometimes 100 to 200 a day,' he said. 'The children especially are exhausted and ill. Many are suffering from malaria and diarrhoea. All are starved.' Khartoum seven months ago imposed a ban on all UN relief flights into the region. Paul Savage, Christian Aid's senior field officer in southern Sudan, said: 'Foreign investors and foreign workers are being invited into the oil fields, but relief is being denied to people forced from their homes to secure that oil.' In London last week, non-governmental organisations held a meeting with BP Amoco and urged it to sever links with a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation in which it has acquired a $570 million stake. They argued that the subsidiary, PetroChina, was linked to CNPC 'like a Siamese twin'; BP insisted there was a 'fire wall' between the two. 'We asked BP Amoco not to invest in PetroChina while CNPC remains a partner in the Greater Nile project,' a source at the meeting told The Observer. 'BP accepted the investment linkages were strong - and then proceeded to take the \"constructive engagement\" line.' David Rice, director of BP's Policy Unit, admitted oil was responsible for human rights abuses in Sudan and was financing the war against the South. But the BP delegation said the company was committed to increasing its stake in PetroChina to $1 billion. Sudan is an attractive investment prospect because of its low-cost, high-quality reserves, estimated at more than 800 million barrels. Production stands at more than 200,000 barrels a day. Human rights groups refute BP's 'fire wall' defence and demand the severance of BP's Chinese connection. 'In buying into PetroChina, BP is investing in oil in Sudan and has to take responsibility for human rights abuses in the area,' says Annetta Weber of Amnesty International.",

      "body": "<p>We don't know if Betty Boothroyd has ever breast-fed a child. Public record would have us assume she has not. But you can't be too careful. As Commons Speaker we do know that she has just banned breast-feeding from committee rooms and the public gallery in the Houses of Parliament. The Commons chamber itself is already a no-go zone. Maybe such an anti-baby measure can only come from someone who has had nothing to do with them.</p> <p>Breast-feeding is such a touchy subject. Just as paternity leave is an issue with a bit more bite within those hallowed walls at the moment, so now is breast-feeding. Boothroyd is wrong to ban nursing mothers. A number of MPs, some of them women, have new-born babies to deal with. Some of those nursing MPs are on committees and need to be present in committee rooms. But as Swindon MP Julia Down, who had a baby five months ago, says: 'No one wants people to be disturbed, but babies are quiet when they are being breast-fed. The general rule should be, if it does not disturb anyone it should be allowed.'</p> <p>Most women in this country don't breast-feed. Even if they do it is for a very short time compared to those in other countries. Those of us who do breast-feed our kids don't need bans in the working place to make it even harder than it already is.</p> <p>I've written the phrase 'those of us who breast-feed our kids' literally. I breast-fed my kid for four and a half years. Though, of course, when they get that big you don't admit it at the time for fear the Social will have them off you. Especially as in my case it was a boy.</p> <p>There are hazards. When he developed teeth he did bite. It was only the once because much to my amazed surprise an entirely involuntary left hook caught him on the chin as soon as his savage molars closed around my ripped flesh. Before I knew it, the blow travelled at huge speed in one flowing motion from my shoulder through my arm and down to my fist. He never did it again.</p> <p>Don't be fooled into thinking breast-feeding is easy or fun. If it were it would be illegal. Mother and child are not enrapt in a continuously glorious and blissfully sensuous haze of mum and babe exclusivity. Long-term breast-feeding with an older child is a mixed bag. Sometimes they nuzzle. Other times it's a 'hit and run', a quick snack in transit as they dash past. It's a bit like standing close to the edge of the platform at Crewe train station when the InterCities fly through. Twenty seconds a breast max. Bah, boom and off.</p> <p>There is a lot about breast-feeding that is a drag. Not least the fact that it is an issue which divides women against themselves. When I first outed myself as a long-term breast-feeder my post-bag exploded with the velocity of a storm in a D-cup.</p> <p>'Weird!' they said. 'Completely bizarre.' 'Psychologically disturbed.' And those were the compliments.</p> <p>The hallowed image of the Madonna feeding her new-born is OK. But there is a line that is crossed as the child gets older. It was a divide I never really got a handle on. For most people it seems to be when a toddler walks up to its mum, heaves up her T-shirt and latches on without concern for decorum or convention. I'm small and my boy is tall. I think we started seriously raising eyebrows when, still breast-feeding, he grew high enough to reach my rib cage.</p> <p>There were times when keeping the breast-feeding going was tough. I'm a freelance with an erratic schedule. I travel all over the country. An average day might see me catching the 6.40am flight from Heathrow to Glasgow. So dawn would find me marching on to the plane overnight bag over one shoulder, suit-holder over the other and baby strapped on front.</p> <p>I was cavalier about who I left him with. (Psychiatrists who complain about over attachment and an inability to separate out might like to explore that.) I would often be working in hotel complexes and would simply book one of their babysitters over the phone, never knowing who they were in advance.</p> <p>After I'd dumped him I'd go off and do my filming or give my speech or chair a conference or whatever. When I had a break, I'd race back down the hotel's corridors to our room, ripping open my blouse as I went and whacking him on for a top-up. After a quick zap I'd race back down the corridors doing up the buttons as I ran.</p> <p>It was chaotic and muddled. When he got too big to travel I started breast pumping. That's when you develop a more intimate relationship with your pump that you do with your partner. Which brings us to the milk itself. People find it kind of yucky. I would go off to work leaving precious plastic bags full of the stuff. They're cute little see through sachets full of pale liquid with all the cream risen to the top a bit like gold top.</p> <p>But we also kept bought baby formula in the house for emergencies. Curiously these would always be used rather than my carefully harvested milk. I never pushed it. It's one of the most benign body secretions, but it is still a secretion. People, other people, can't seem to handle it. In the end I had a freezer full of the stuff. It got chucked.</p> <p>I heard of one new mum who went back to work soon after the birth. She sensed unease about her breast-pumping. But she kept going by carefully storing her milk in an anonymous looking closed box in the office fridge. Someone stole it.</p> <p>The challenge when you are away from a baby is to stimulate the breasts so that the milk keeps flowing. In the end I got tired of carting the machine around so I pumped and squeezed my breasts by hand. It is much like milking a cow and it nails penis envy on the head.

      "bodyText": "We don't know if Betty Boothroyd has ever breast-fed a child. Public record would have us assume she has not. But you can't be too careful. As Commons Speaker we do know that she has just banned breast-feeding from committee rooms and the public gallery in the Houses of Parliament. The Commons chamber itself is already a no-go zone. Maybe such an anti-baby measure can only come from someone who has had nothing to do with them. Breast-feeding is such a touchy subject. Just as paternity leave is an issue with a bit more bite within those hallowed walls at the moment, so now is breast-feeding. Boothroyd is wrong to ban nursing mothers. A number of MPs, some of them women, have new-born babies to deal with. Some of those nursing MPs are on committees and need to be present in committee rooms. But as Swindon MP Julia Down, who had a baby five months ago, says: 'No one wants people to be disturbed, but babies are quiet when they are being breast-fed. The general rule should be, if it does not disturb anyone it should be allowed.' Most women in this country don't breast-feed. Even if they do it is for a very short time compared to those in other countries. Those of us who do breast-feed our kids don't need bans in the working place to make it even harder than it already is. I've written the phrase 'those of us who breast-feed our kids' literally. I breast-fed my kid for four and a half years. Though, of course, when they get that big you don't admit it at the time for fear the Social will have them off you. Especially as in my case it was a boy. There are hazards. When he developed teeth he did bite. It was only the once because much to my amazed surprise an entirely involuntary left hook caught him on the chin as soon as his savage molars closed around my ripped flesh. Before I knew it, the blow travelled at huge speed in one flowing motion from my shoulder through my arm and down to my fist. He never did it again. Don't be fooled into thinking breast-feeding is easy or fun. If it were it would be illegal. Mother and child are not enrapt in a continuously glorious and blissfully sensuous haze of mum and babe exclusivity. Long-term breast-feeding with an older child is a mixed bag. Sometimes they nuzzle. Other times it's a 'hit and run', a quick snack in transit as they dash past. It's a bit like standing close to the edge of the platform at Crewe train station when the InterCities fly through. Twenty seconds a breast max. Bah, boom and off. There is a lot about breast-feeding that is a drag. Not least the fact that it is an issue which divides women against themselves. When I first outed myself as a long-term breast-feeder my post-bag exploded with the velocity of a storm in a D-cup. 'Weird!' they said. 'Completely bizarre.' 'Psychologically disturbed.' And those were the compliments. The hallowed image of the Madonna feeding her new-born is OK. But there is a line that is crossed as the child gets older. It was a divide I never really got a handle on. For most people it seems to be when a toddler walks up to its mum, heaves up her T-shirt and latches on without concern for decorum or convention. I'm small and my boy is tall. I think we started seriously raising eyebrows when, still breast-feeding, he grew high enough to reach my rib cage. There were times when keeping the breast-feeding going was tough. I'm a freelance with an erratic schedule. I travel all over the country. An average day might see me catching the 6.40am flight from Heathrow to Glasgow. So dawn would find me marching on to the plane overnight bag over one shoulder, suit-holder over the other and baby strapped on front. I was cavalier about who I left him with. (Psychiatrists who complain about over attachment and an inability to separate out might like to explore that.) I would often be working in hotel complexes and would simply book one of their babysitters over the phone, never knowing who they were in advance. After I'd dumped him I'd go off and do my filming or give my speech or chair a conference or whatever. When I had a break, I'd race back down the hotel's corridors to our room, ripping open my blouse as I went and whacking him on for a top-up. After a quick zap I'd race back down the corridors doing up the buttons as I ran. It was chaotic and muddled. When he got too big to travel I started breast pumping. That's when you develop a more intimate relationship with your pump that you do with your partner. Which brings us to the milk itself. People find it kind of yucky. I would go off to work leaving precious plastic bags full of the stuff. They're cute little see through sachets full of pale liquid with all the cream risen to the top a bit like gold top. But we also kept bought baby formula in the house for emergencies. Curiously these would always be used rather than my carefully harvested milk. I never pushed it. It's one of the most benign body secretions, but it is still a secretion. People, other people, can't seem to handle it. In the end I had a freezer full of the stuff. It got chucked. I heard of one new mum who went back to work soon after the birth. She sensed unease about her breast-pumping. But she kept going by carefully storing her milk in an anonymous looking closed box in the office fridge. Someone stole it. The challenge when you are away from a baby is to stimulate the breasts so that the milk keeps flowing. In the end I got tired of carting the machine around so I pumped and squeezed my breasts by hand. It is much like milking a cow and it nails penis envy on the head. I could shoot my milk a good five feet. It had the arc of a diver: Five glorious spurting feet of unadulterated pure honeyed nectar. The issue in Parliament has been finessed. What they have actually banned is all 'refreshments'. Of course they would turn their noses up at someone dripping hot greasy cheeseburgers on the carpet while they're chowing down on the chips.

      "body": "<p>In the middle of a business park near Chiswick, west London, amid a welter of construction work, an idea is taking shape. </p> <p>The idea is based on a plan to force a head-on collision between the worlds of television and the Internet: combining the wide appeal of the former and the interactive draw of the latter. Employees at the firm behind the plan, a little known company called Network of the World (NOW), believe the impact will change the way the media works, transforming the way the media tells its 'stories'. </p> <p>At the heart of the idea is the belief that the mass media is dying: new technology is allowing individuals to personalise what they watch and how they access it. And, as individuals become empowered, they want to control their media rather than digest it passively. The consequence is that audiences start to splinter into groups around shared interests. </p> <p>This is the theory promoted by Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW), the new media business run by Richard Li, which intends to turn its NOW subsidiary into a global media player. A few months ago not that many people outside the Pacific Rim knew much about Li, other than that he was the son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man. </p> <p>But since the start of the year PCCW has burst on to the global stage, pulling off an audacious coup which should see it acquire Cable &amp; Wireless's 54 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecom. Alliances with the likes of Internet investment fund CMGi and last week's deal with Australian telecoms carrier, Telstra, reinforce the impression that Li is in no mood to slow down. </p> <p>Li is refocusing PCCW from being a telecoms equipment firm into a pure Internet player. The company's re-orientation, not to mention its unique plans for reformatting television, are Li's personal vision. 'The Internet is a world that Richard totally understands and is part of. He has a different focus from his father,' said Michael Johnson, Li's senior adviser charged with getting the project up and running by June. </p> <p>This will be no small feat. The company wants to recruit 1,500 people. It is also rushing to finish the construction of its HQ, complete with a state-of-the art broadcasting studio, digital library and production suites. NOW's real challenge is technological. It needs to ensure its Internet arm meshes with its television offering. The plan is to start with a single television channel, which will later split into several channels. But each programme will have its own Internet links. </p> <p>So a viewer will be watching a television programme and will then be able to click on a link and, say, discuss what they had seen or download information. NOW has a team of 200 producers who will generate four hours of live online content seven days a week. It seems this integrated idea was partially inspired by the situation in the US where Internet users often surf on their PCs while watching television. </p> <p>NOW wants to go further than creating an integrated television/Internet offering. Users who access the Network of the World will be able to build their own web-sites so that every TV programme spawns fans who create their own content. </p> <p>'Up until the 1980s, TV was so powerful that it had to be controlled by government. The idea of allowing people to generate and become a part of the mass media is principally taking place in the web. This is the democratisation of the mass media realm, you should be able to create content no matter who you are. It's all about engaging people in the stories,' Johnson said. </p> <p>As telecom networks develop and become able to carry heavier traffic, including video data, users will be able to make their own broadcasts which can be linked to NOW's broadcasts, thus expanding its reach ever further. And, because content on the web is never destroyed, users will be able to pick it up and re-package it, becoming their own producers. </p> <p>'As you increase the bandwidth you're changing the story. When you make that story bi-directional that's a big change. We used to need presenters to explain things to us, today people want to do things for themselves,' Johnson said. </p> <p>'It reflects people's desire to find their niche. It's about lining up smaller and smaller communities,' he said. </p> <p>And, of course, the more audiences are segmented the easier they are to profile - vital for advertisers who are looking to reach specific audiences and are becoming increasingly lost in the infinite mass of the Internet. It is an old approach - copying the way the magazine market segments readers around interests - albeit using some very clever technology. </p> <p>Such innovation does not come cheap. PCCW, which has a market value of more than $30 billion, declines to say how much money is being invested in the project, but Johnson admits it amounts to 'hundreds of millions of dollars'. The initial plan is to focus on the Asian market where NOW will be broadcast to 63 countries with a combined potential audience of 135 million households. Europe will be targeted later. </p> <p>But despite NOW's attempts at technological innovation and its claims about the death of the mass market, the company is not reluctant to rely on a decidedly old fashioned, not to say populist way of introducing itself to the world. In the same way that BSkyB used sport to draw in the viewers, NOW is keen to buy up rights to live events. It has the broadcasting rights to Indian cricket matches and is rumoured to be looking at Internet rights to the Wimbledon tennis tournament and considering a similar deal with football's Premier League clubs. </p> <p>The fact that PCCW's main partner in NOW is the world's largest sports marketing firm suggests its plans have substance. PCCW's partnership with TWI, the broadcasting arm of International Management Group, gives it access to more than 130,000 hours of sports programming. IMG is also a leading adviser on Internet rights to many of the world's top teams which means its insights will be invaluable if PCCW goes shopping for content. In addition to its sports arm, NOW will also roll out channels devoted to technology, money and lifestyle. </p> <p>As new technology improves online broadcasting over the next five years, PCCW's self-confessed attempts to become the 'largest broadband Internet business in the world' become more understandable. Such grandiose claims help explain why the fledgling company is valued so highly: they also raise concerns about what would happen if the recent slide in Internet stocks turned into a slump. </p> <p>Given Li's financial fire-power (backers include chip giant Intel) - not to mention his family contacts in Asian and Far Eastern business communities - other media firms which had ignored PCCW now have to start taking it seriously. Rupert Murdoch realised this earlier this year when he backed a rival bid for Hong Kong Telecom, in an attempt to thwart Li's expansion plans. </p> <p>Li realised the cash to create PCCW by selling Star TV, the first pan-Asian satellite television network, to Murdoch's News Corp in 1993. Just how much Murdoch comes to regret the sale depends on how powerfully Li's interpretation for the future of broadcasting pans out. </p> <p>Whether viewers of the future will want to play such an active role in the way they consume their media is a big question. After all, couch potatoes may not be so amenable to two-way telly.</p>",

The company's re-orientation, not to mention its unique plans for reformatting television, are Li's personal vision. 'The Internet is a world that Richard totally understands and is part of. He has a different focus from his father,' said Michael Johnson, Li's senior adviser charged with getting the project up and running by June. This will be no small feat. The company wants to recruit 1,500 people. It is also rushing to finish the construction of its HQ, complete with a state-of-the art broadcasting studio, digital library and production suites. NOW's real challenge is technological. It needs to ensure its Internet arm meshes with its television offering. The plan is to start with a single television channel, which will later split into several channels. But each programme will have its own Internet links. So a viewer will be watching a television programme and will then be able to click on a link and, say, discuss what they had seen or download information. NOW has a team of 200 producers who will generate four hours of live online content seven days a week. It seems this integrated idea was partially inspired by the situation in the US where Internet users often surf on their PCs while watching television. NOW wants to go further than creating an integrated television/Internet offering. Users who access the Network of the World will be able to build their own web-sites so that every TV programme spawns fans who create their own content. 'Up until the 1980s, TV was so powerful that it had to be controlled by government. The idea of allowing people to generate and become a part of the mass media is principally taking place in the web. This is the democratisation of the mass media realm, you should be able to create content no matter who you are. It's all about engaging people in the stories,' Johnson said. As telecom networks develop and become able to carry heavier traffic, including video data, users will be able to make their own broadcasts which can be linked to NOW's broadcasts, thus expanding its reach ever further. And, because content on the web is never destroyed, users will be able to pick it up and re-package it, becoming their own producers. 'As you increase the bandwidth you're changing the story. When you make that story bi-directional that's a big change. We used to need presenters to explain things to us, today people want to do things for themselves,' Johnson said. 'It reflects people's desire to find their niche. It's about lining up smaller and smaller communities,' he said. And, of course, the more audiences are segmented the easier they are to profile - vital for advertisers who are looking to reach specific audiences and are becoming increasingly lost in the infinite mass of the Internet. It is an old approach - copying the way the magazine market segments readers around interests - albeit using some very clever technology. Such innovation does not come cheap. PCCW, which has a market value of more than $30 billion, declines to say how much money is being invested in the project, but Johnson admits it amounts to 'hundreds of millions of dollars'. The initial plan is to focus on the Asian market where NOW will be broadcast to 63 countries with a combined potential audience of 135 million households. Europe will be targeted later. But despite NOW's attempts at technological innovation and its claims about the death of the mass market, the company is not reluctant to rely on a decidedly old fashioned, not to say populist way of introducing itself to the world. In the same way that BSkyB used sport to draw in the viewers, NOW is keen to buy up rights to live events. It has the broadcasting rights to Indian cricket matches and is rumoured to be looking at Internet rights to the Wimbledon tennis tournament and considering a similar deal with football's Premier League clubs. The fact that PCCW's main partner in NOW is the world's largest sports marketing firm suggests its plans have substance. PCCW's partnership with TWI, the broadcasting arm of International Management Group, gives it access to more than 130,000 hours of sports programming. IMG is also a leading adviser on Internet rights to many of the world's top teams which means its insights will be invaluable if PCCW goes shopping for content. In addition to its sports arm, NOW will also roll out channels devoted to technology, money and lifestyle. As new technology improves online broadcasting over the next five years, PCCW's self-confessed attempts to become the 'largest broadband Internet business in the world' become more understandable. Such grandiose claims help explain why the fledgling company is valued so highly: they also raise concerns about what would happen if the recent slide in Internet stocks turned into a slump. Given Li's financial fire-power (backers include chip giant Intel) - not to mention his family contacts in Asian and Far Eastern business communities - other media firms which had ignored PCCW now have to start taking it seriously. Rupert Murdoch realised this earlier this year when he backed a rival bid for Hong Kong Telecom, in an attempt to thwart Li's expansion plans. Li realised the cash to create PCCW by selling Star TV, the first pan-Asian satellite television network, to Murdoch's News Corp in 1993. Just how much Murdoch comes to regret the sale depends on how powerfully Li's interpretation for the future of broadcasting pans out. Whether viewers of the future will want to play such an active role in the way they consume their media is a big question. After all, couch potatoes may not be so amenable to two-way telly.",

You simply take a deck of high-street shops, shuffle them thoroughly, drop about a quarter of them on the floor, then spread the rest out wherever they look as if they might fit. Oh and don't expect to win: if BrandMAX is anything like all the variations which have been played out on Britain's high streets over the last decade, there will be only losers. </p> <p>Arcadia, the BrandMAX croupier, is an old hand at such games, having entertained the City with them regularly, both before and after its divorce from the Debenhams department store. </p> <p>This time round, however, the stakes are much higher as it has spent \u00a3151 million adding the three suits in the Sears pack - Wallis, Warehouse and Miss Selfridge - to its hand. </p> <p>Those without the right spirit of adventure questioned the wisdom of this, given Arcadia's difficulty in making sure that all its suits - including such fashion essentials as Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins and Evans - were playing the same game. </p> <p>It looked particularly brave when even players with a consistently good record like Marks &amp; Spencer were failing to come up with a winning strategy. The result is en-tirely according to form. It has found itself with too many shops, most of them in the wrong place, and too few shoppers. The complicated matrix of openings, closings and relocations which BrandMAX involves will be all too familiar to anyone with shares in Arcadia. </p> <p>In summary, 654 of its 2,187 stores will be closed, including all of its Principles men's and womenswear chains, and 300 will be opened. It is not as simple as that, of course. Among the rest, some brands will be moved into different stores, some brands will be combined in one outlet and some will be reopened as concessions in someone else's stores. </p> <p>The reshuffling is costing \u00a390 million, including \u00a330 million in cash to be spent on things like sacking 3,500 people and paying rents on shops it no longer wants. That is high for a company which has already had to beg its bankers for more time to pay off its debts. Those bankers can only hope that its estimates are accurate and that the \u00a3160 million annual savings promised by August 2002 do actually materialise. </p> <p>Finding new tenants for that number of stores would be challenging, even in a buoyant high street. Even if it succeeds, there must be a question mark over how much of those cost-savings will be passed back into profits, given the relentless pressure on high-street prices. Just look at the collapse in Arcadia's operating margin from 3.8 to 0.1 per cent in the six months to 26 February. </p> <p>The fact is that the high street is crowded with clothing stores offering things no one wants to buy. Arcadia is at least addressing that problem, but the risk is that its action will be too little, too late. Leave the shares on the shelf along with the clothes. </p> <p> <strong> Gizmo wizards</strong><br> </p> <p>We all know that the likes of Vodafone and Nokia are benefiting from our obsession with talking to each other while on the bus, the street or at the local restaurant. A less publicised beneficiary is Pressac, a small electronics company which is transferring its skills in producing switches and other electronic bits from car dashboards into making keypads for those irritating little handsets. </p> <p>It has become an instant success. Two years ago it was just looking at the market. Now, the big three handset suppliers - Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola - are among its customers and it estimates it has about 10 per cent of the market. </p> <p>Demand for mobile phones is rising by 35 per cent a year and - the industry hopes - WAP technology and other such gizmos mean that rate of growth will continue for a few more years. </p> <p>Pressac's order book has almost doubled from \u00a330 million to \u00a355m in six months, and chief executive Geoff White thinks its superior technology means it should win more market share. It is investing \u00a320m over three years to build a dedicated manufacturing base for the keypads. Despite its early stage of development, and the investment needed to grow the business, it is already making profits: \u00a32.9m in the six months to end-January, double that achieved last time, on sales up 40 per cent to \u00a320.3m. </p> <p>Pressac's automotive business is also doing well, benefiting from the growing use of electronic components in cars which is cushioning it from the effects of over-capacity and sluggish demand. </p> <p>Overall, pre-tax profits from continuing businesses, before exceptionals, rose almost 30 per cent and analysts expect a strong second half too. Yet the shares trade on around 15 times earnings - cheap for a company with such good growth prospects. Buy. </p> <p><strong> Okay to indulge</strong><br> </p> <p>The team of young managers sent off on Unilever's foresight programme to find out what its customers want apparently came up with a rather odd finding: we want to get thinner and fitter but we want to indulge ourselves as well. </p> <p>Ever responsive to our needs, Unilever is to help us do just that with the acquisition of Slim-Fast, America's largest maker of replacement meals and 'slimming' bars, and Ben &amp; Jerry's, the ultimate in indulgence ice creams. </p> <p>Both are rather unusual moves for a company which has managed to create brands like Magnum, I Can't Believe it's not Butter or Chicken Tonight using only a laboratory and a multi-million marketing budget. Both, however, also make perfect strategic sense. </p> <p>Slimming products have existed for years in Europe but largely in a niche market of chemist's shops and slimming-clubs. </p> <p>Backed by Unilever's marketing muscle, there must be at least a fair chance that they can get to the kind of $1.3 billion (\u00a3810 million) sales achieved in the US, where the 20 per cent annual sales increases make them one of the fastest-growing food categories. </p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's, too, could benefit from a bit more focused promotion - that should more than make up for losing its socially responsible tag. These deals demonstrate that the pace of change at Unilever is not slowing. Its shares have been weak on investor fears that it had retreated into its conservative shell. That is misguided.

That is high for a company which has already had to beg its bankers for more time to pay off its debts. Those bankers can only hope that its estimates are accurate and that the \u00a3160 million annual savings promised by August 2002 do actually materialise. Finding new tenants for that number of stores would be challenging, even in a buoyant high street. Even if it succeeds, there must be a question mark over how much of those cost-savings will be passed back into profits, given the relentless pressure on high-street prices. Just look at the collapse in Arcadia's operating margin from 3.8 to 0.1 per cent in the six months to 26 February. The fact is that the high street is crowded with clothing stores offering things no one wants to buy. Arcadia is at least addressing that problem, but the risk is that its action will be too little, too late. Leave the shares on the shelf along with the clothes. Gizmo wizards We all know that the likes of Vodafone and Nokia are benefiting from our obsession with talking to each other while on the bus, the street or at the local restaurant. A less publicised beneficiary is Pressac, a small electronics company which is transferring its skills in producing switches and other electronic bits from car dashboards into making keypads for those irritating little handsets. It has become an instant success. Two years ago it was just looking at the market. Now, the big three handset suppliers - Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola - are among its customers and it estimates it has about 10 per cent of the market. Demand for mobile phones is rising by 35 per cent a year and - the industry hopes - WAP technology and other such gizmos mean that rate of growth will continue for a few more years. Pressac's order book has almost doubled from \u00a330 million to \u00a355m in six months, and chief executive Geoff White thinks its superior technology means it should win more market share. It is investing \u00a320m over three years to build a dedicated manufacturing base for the keypads. Despite its early stage of development, and the investment needed to grow the business, it is already making profits: \u00a32.9m in the six months to end-January, double that achieved last time, on sales up 40 per cent to \u00a320.3m. Pressac's automotive business is also doing well, benefiting from the growing use of electronic components in cars which is cushioning it from the effects of over-capacity and sluggish demand. Overall, pre-tax profits from continuing businesses, before exceptionals, rose almost 30 per cent and analysts expect a strong second half too. Yet the shares trade on around 15 times earnings - cheap for a company with such good growth prospects. Buy. Okay to indulge The team of young managers sent off on Unilever's foresight programme to find out what its customers want apparently came up with a rather odd finding: we want to get thinner and fitter but we want to indulge ourselves as well. Ever responsive to our needs, Unilever is to help us do just that with the acquisition of Slim-Fast, America's largest maker of replacement meals and 'slimming' bars, and Ben &amp; Jerry's, the ultimate in indulgence ice creams. Both are rather unusual moves for a company which has managed to create brands like Magnum, I Can't Believe it's not Butter or Chicken Tonight using only a laboratory and a multi-million marketing budget. Both, however, also make perfect strategic sense. Slimming products have existed for years in Europe but largely in a niche market of chemist's shops and slimming-clubs. Backed by Unilever's marketing muscle, there must be at least a fair chance that they can get to the kind of $1.3 billion (\u00a3810 million) sales achieved in the US, where the 20 per cent annual sales increases make them one of the fastest-growing food categories. Ben &amp; Jerry's, too, could benefit from a bit more focused promotion - that should more than make up for losing its socially responsible tag. These deals demonstrate that the pace of change at Unilever is not slowing. Its shares have been weak on investor fears that it had retreated into its conservative shell. That is misguided. Buy.",

      "body": "<p>If you had the misfortune to fall ill in seventeenth-century England, the last thing you would have wanted was a visit from the doctor. </p> <p>The human body was a mystery as deep as the universe. The suffering patient had to face the quack, who would discern which of four 'humours' was out of balance, before cutting a specific vein, pouring off blood and stitching up the wound. </p> <p>The great philosopher Thomas Hobbes said he would 'rather have the advice or take physic from an experienced old woman'. Much has changed in the intervening 200 years - from advances in public health to the discovery of penicillin. But in one respect things have stayed the same - medicine works backwards from diagnosis into the still-mysterious human body. The process has been still little more than trial and error. </p> <p>Now, however, a genuine revolution is under way. The human body is literally being turned inside out. The blueprint of life - made up of pairs of spiral 'barcodes' of DNA 3 billion characters long - is just months if not weeks away from being decoded. </p> <p>The effect on pharmaceutical development will be revolutionary. Paul Triniman of biotechnology firm Oxford Glycosciences says: 'Until now medicine has been geared to working from the symptoms of diseases and treating these. Now it can make cures from causes.' </p> <p>Genes create proteins which instruct cells in the body how to act. Most diseases are caused by too many, too few, or malformed proteins being created by cells. Medicines are developed by isolating these cells and 'targeting' them for treatment. </p> <p>In the 50 years in which modern pharmaceutical research has developed, some 500 'targets' have been painstakingly identified. The unravelled DNA blueprint, or genome, will reveal up to 10,000 new ones. </p> <p>The hope is that terrible diseases from cancers to heart disease, diabetes, schizophrenia and osteoporosis will be curable by altering genes instead of just suppressing symptoms. </p> <p>But for the real benefits of the genome to be realised, the promise of science has to meet commercial demands. At one level, the picture seems bright. Big drugs companies which have invested in genomic technology have seen their research efforts accelerate. With the completion of the genome they can effectively go supersonic. SmithKline Beecham (SB) says before it began genomic research in 1993 it would explore six to eight drug targets a year. With genomic research it examines 200. </p> <p>Drug development is lengthy and costly. It takes some 15 years and $500 million to get an idea to market. Only 10 per cent make it. Genomics can weed out the chaff early, and will also be able to screen patients to detect who will be able to benefit from particular drugs. </p> <p>Research by Andersen Consulting indicates that new technology will increase the success rate to 30 per cent by 2008, and firms will be able to concentrate on high-revenue treatments. Andersen partner Nick Edwards says: 'The number of treatments coming out of research will increase. In addition, companies will be able to run smaller, more focused clinical trials programmes, and lower their costs dramatically.' </p> <p>But there are big problems with the relationship between genome science and business. The first is ethical. The race to unravel the genome has caused controversy. Celera, a Maryland-based private company, has vied with the publicly funded European-American collaboration called the Human Genome Project (HGP) to churn through the 3 billion characters and publish the sequence first, for profit. </p> <p>Some firms have attempted to 'patent' genes, preventing competitors from using them. Tim Hubbard of the Wellcome Trust's Sanger Centre - which is collaborating with the HGP, says: 'It's like fishing with dynamite.

      "bodyText": "If you had the misfortune to fall ill in seventeenth-century England, the last thing you would have wanted was a visit from the doctor. The human body was a mystery as deep as the universe. The suffering patient had to face the quack, who would discern which of four 'humours' was out of balance, before cutting a specific vein, pouring off blood and stitching up the wound. The great philosopher Thomas Hobbes said he would 'rather have the advice or take physic from an experienced old woman'. Much has changed in the intervening 200 years - from advances in public health to the discovery of penicillin. But in one respect things have stayed the same - medicine works backwards from diagnosis into the still-mysterious human body. The process has been still little more than trial and error. Now, however, a genuine revolution is under way. The human body is literally being turned inside out. The blueprint of life - made up of pairs of spiral 'barcodes' of DNA 3 billion characters long - is just months if not weeks away from being decoded. The effect on pharmaceutical development will be revolutionary. Paul Triniman of biotechnology firm Oxford Glycosciences says: 'Until now medicine has been geared to working from the symptoms of diseases and treating these. Now it can make cures from causes.' Genes create proteins which instruct cells in the body how to act. Most diseases are caused by too many, too few, or malformed proteins being created by cells. Medicines are developed by isolating these cells and 'targeting' them for treatment. In the 50 years in which modern pharmaceutical research has developed, some 500 'targets' have been painstakingly identified. The unravelled DNA blueprint, or genome, will reveal up to 10,000 new ones. The hope is that terrible diseases from cancers to heart disease, diabetes, schizophrenia and osteoporosis will be curable by altering genes instead of just suppressing symptoms. But for the real benefits of the genome to be realised, the promise of science has to meet commercial demands. At one level, the picture seems bright. Big drugs companies which have invested in genomic technology have seen their research efforts accelerate. With the completion of the genome they can effectively go supersonic. SmithKline Beecham (SB) says before it began genomic research in 1993 it would explore six to eight drug targets a year. With genomic research it examines 200. Drug development is lengthy and costly. It takes some 15 years and $500 million to get an idea to market. Only 10 per cent make it. Genomics can weed out the chaff early, and will also be able to screen patients to detect who will be able to benefit from particular drugs. Research by Andersen Consulting indicates that new technology will increase the success rate to 30 per cent by 2008, and firms will be able to concentrate on high-revenue treatments. Andersen partner Nick Edwards says: 'The number of treatments coming out of research will increase. In addition, companies will be able to run smaller, more focused clinical trials programmes, and lower their costs dramatically.' But there are big problems with the relationship between genome science and business. The first is ethical. The race to unravel the genome has caused controversy. Celera, a Maryland-based private company, has vied with the publicly funded European-American collaboration called the Human Genome Project (HGP) to churn through the 3 billion characters and publish the sequence first, for profit. Some firms have attempted to 'patent' genes, preventing competitors from using them. Tim Hubbard of the Wellcome Trust's Sanger Centre - which is collaborating with the HGP, says: 'It's like fishing with dynamite. You catch a lot of fish, but you destroy the environment for everyone else.' But the reality is that although patenting actual genes may not be allowed by law, patenting applications derived from them must be. Uncertainty over what can be patented is a problem for the biotech companies. The genome itself is, after all, only the start. It must be exploited by firms using IT systems to screen information, identify targets and develop medicines. Oxford Glycosciences, for example, searches for genes which create protein imbalances and cause disease, inserting its own proteins to cure the problem. But this leads to a second problem. Can the commercial world sustain the level of investment in biotech companies which will make many of the discoveries crucial to delivering the brave new world that science predicts?

The time: early next year; the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Bill has been on the statute book for nearly six months. Alice, UK-plc's star programmer, has been receiving encrypted emails from an old flame, Bob, who (unknown to her) has a dodgy past. </p> <p>Enter Inspector Knacker, armed with a Section 46 Notice requiring Alice to provide the keys necessary to decrypt her correspondence. Section 50 of the RIP Bill requires Alice not to disclose to anyone the existence of the Notice, nor the actions taken pursuant to it. </p> <p>Being a law-abiding subject, Alice gives Knacker the keys. Under Section 50, she may not tell Bob, which is right and proper. But now here's the interesting bit - Alice may not tell her other correspondents that their privacy has been compromised, even though they are entirely innocent and the Inspector is now able to decrypt all their messages as well. </p> <p>She can't tell her boss either, even though his business is suddenly at the mercy of Knacker and his boys. The boss, not surprisingly, is annoyed and demands to know what the hell is going on. But since Alice could go to jail for telling him, she refuses - and is promptly sacked. There is more. </p> <p>Section 50 forbids Alice to tell an industrial tribunal or even a court of law that she has surrendered the keys to Knacker. Nor is she permitted to explain to the court why she is unable to answer the question: 'Have you revealed the keys to any person?' Stressed out, Alice consults her psychiatrist. But if she tells him what is bothering her she can go to jail for that too. </p> <p>This scenario is just one of several envisaged by Dr. Charles Lindsey of Manchester University in a fascinating commentary on the legal farrago which is currently being railroaded through the Commons by the Interior Ministry (prop. J. Straw). The RIP Bill is such a crazed piece of legislation that one wonders if the Government hasn't taken leave of its senses. Bemused MPs say they don't understand this encryption stuff and hide behind the assumption that the Home Office must know what it's doing. </p> <p>Big mistake. It's becoming clear that Straw &amp; Co have no idea of the nightmare they are creating. Their screwball Bill is the product of a shambles in Whitehall over online regulation. </p> <p>The original e-commerce Bill was the responsibility of the DTI: when it became clear that its fatuous proposals over encryption were going to bring the Bill down, they were summarily dropped. Responsibility for encryption policy passed to the Home Office, which is obsessed with official secrecy, buttressing police powers and doing whatever GCHQ requires. The RIP disaster is the result. </p> <p>Does this matter to anyone other than us civil liberties fanatics? Answer: you bet. Many companies are deeply worried about the RIP Bill's provisions. And they are looking westward, to where Section 26 of the Irish E-Commerce Bill declares that 'nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring the disclosure of unique data, such as codes, passwords, algorithms, private cryptographic keys, or other data, that may be necessary to render information or an electronic communication intelligible'. </p> <p>To get this protection from snooping, however, it won't be enough to host your e-commerce site on an Irish server while running the business from Britain, because Straw's Bill will cover every communication you send from your base. You will have to move the business to Ireland. Which of course is exactly what the Irish government is banking on. And they give whopping tax breaks too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The scene: an office in a high-tech start-up of the kind beloved of Iron Chancellor Brown. Let us call it UK-plc.com. The time: early next year; the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Bill has been on the statute book for nearly six months. Alice, UK-plc's star programmer, has been receiving encrypted emails from an old flame, Bob, who (unknown to her) has a dodgy past. Enter Inspector Knacker, armed with a Section 46 Notice requiring Alice to provide the keys necessary to decrypt her correspondence. Section 50 of the RIP Bill requires Alice not to disclose to anyone the existence of the Notice, nor the actions taken pursuant to it. Being a law-abiding subject, Alice gives Knacker the keys. Under Section 50, she may not tell Bob, which is right and proper. But now here's the interesting bit - Alice may not tell her other correspondents that their privacy has been compromised, even though they are entirely innocent and the Inspector is now able to decrypt all their messages as well. She can't tell her boss either, even though his business is suddenly at the mercy of Knacker and his boys. The boss, not surprisingly, is annoyed and demands to know what the hell is going on. But since Alice could go to jail for telling him, she refuses - and is promptly sacked. There is more. Section 50 forbids Alice to tell an industrial tribunal or even a court of law that she has surrendered the keys to Knacker. Nor is she permitted to explain to the court why she is unable to answer the question: 'Have you revealed the keys to any person?' Stressed out, Alice consults her psychiatrist. But if she tells him what is bothering her she can go to jail for that too. This scenario is just one of several envisaged by Dr. Charles Lindsey of Manchester University in a fascinating commentary on the legal farrago which is currently being railroaded through the Commons by the Interior Ministry (prop. J. Straw). The RIP Bill is such a crazed piece of legislation that one wonders if the Government hasn't taken leave of its senses. Bemused MPs say they don't understand this encryption stuff and hide behind the assumption that the Home Office must know what it's doing. Big mistake. It's becoming clear that Straw &amp; Co have no idea of the nightmare they are creating. Their screwball Bill is the product of a shambles in Whitehall over online regulation. The original e-commerce Bill was the responsibility of the DTI: when it became clear that its fatuous proposals over encryption were going to bring the Bill down, they were summarily dropped. Responsibility for encryption policy passed to the Home Office, which is obsessed with official secrecy, buttressing police powers and doing whatever GCHQ requires. The RIP disaster is the result. Does this matter to anyone other than us civil liberties fanatics? Answer: you bet. Many companies are deeply worried about the RIP Bill's provisions. And they are looking westward, to where Section 26 of the Irish E-Commerce Bill declares that 'nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring the disclosure of unique data, such as codes, passwords, algorithms, private cryptographic keys, or other data, that may be necessary to render information or an electronic communication intelligible'. To get this protection from snooping, however, it won't be enough to host your e-commerce site on an Irish server while running the business from Britain, because Straw's Bill will cover every communication you send from your base. You will have to move the business to Ireland. Which of course is exactly what the Irish government is banking on. And they give whopping tax breaks too.",

The problem is that, once it's there, it is fixed, frozen in a particular time and stage of evolution.

As you reverse, gentle chimes, exactly like the ones that sound on planes when it's okay to undo your seat belt after take off, grow more urgent the nearer you get to the car behind. Once you've learnt not to yell 'Oi, ger orf, you perv!' at the seat, or get up to ask the stewardess for a Bloody Mary as you pull out into traffic - something the writers of the Highway Code neglected to specifically forbid, by the way - this is all rather pleasant. Unfortunately, thanks to the Americanised suspension, driving the Cadillac feels a lot like driving a bouncy castle, and, more crucial yet, the thing looks disappointing. Where are the fins?

The production team learnt of this hitch the day before the show and scoured the city for a jeweller to fashion a new badge overnight. They kept the chequered flag, but replaced the Stars and Stripes with the Chevrolet company flag - which made sense - and a fleur-de-lis, the symbol of French royalty, which patently did not.

Last week in New York one of Wall Street's highest-flyers stood trial on charges of passing inside information to a glamorous porn star who made a killing on the US stock market. </p> <p>James McDermott, former president of US investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, faces seven charges of insider trading and conspiracy after allegedly passing on share tips about a string of bank mergers. If convicted, he faces fines of $1.25 million and a total of 65 years in jail. </p> <p>The woman he was having an affair with - euphemistically called a 'dancer and model' in the Manhattan court - has fled to Vancouver, Canada, where she faces extradition proceedings. Kathryn Gannon - a 28-year-old veteran of 100 blue movies under the name Marylin Star - has threatened to blow New York apart with revelations about further senior figures on the Street. </p> <p>Her alleged associate, secretive New Jersey businessman Anthony Pompino, with whom she was also having an affair, has turned state's evidence following a two-year probe by the FBI and the powerful Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC). Nonetheless, US prosecutors have put him on trial too. </p> <p>But the case has more than mere titillation value. As the powers of Britain's new watchdog, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), come under concerted attack by vested interests in the City, it demonstrates the wide gulf between the two sides of the Atlantic in matters of market abuse - and how effectively the regulators get their man, or woman. </p> <p>'We've got very workable laws, and the powers we need to obtain evidence from people who don't want to give it,' said Thomas Newkirk, associate enforcement director at the SEC. 'The federal courts in Manhattan are very savvy about the market and what it's all about. We have stiff penalties that can really make people hurt. It's all a very great deterrent.' </p> <p>Ten days ago, the UK mounted its first prosecution for insider dealing since 1996. Lawrence Champion, a tax official, admitted 13 charges of using sensitive Inland Revenue information to go on a 15-month share-dealing spree. </p> <p>Last November, when The Observer last looked at the parliamentary progress of the new Financial Services and Markets Bill, we established that the Crown Prosecution Service had not pursued one insider-dealing case since Labour came to power. This was despite an increasing number of referrals of suspicious dealings by the Stock Exchange and a growing number of investigations by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), responsible for current legislation. </p> <p>When asked, the DTI denied there had been a deliberate switch in policy following the patchy success and frequent embarrassments in prosecuting City fraud. 'There has been no policy change,' a DTI spokeswoman said. 'In all the cases, there has been insufficient evidence to prosecute.' </p> <p>However, The Observer has since learned that a Govern ment Minister told top UK regulators that there would be no high-profile prosecutions until the new Bill, with its extra powers, became law. The minister, Lord Falconer, a close friend of the Prime Minister, was in 1997 Solicitor General, a senior law officer in the Lord Chancellor's department. He is now in the Cabinet Office and in charge of the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>This weekend, senior regulatory sources said there had been no outright ban. 'He [Falconer] may have said there will be no high-profile cases, and therefore no high profile failures,' one regulatory source said. 'But it is something we are working away hard at. It's not that black and white.' </p> <p>However, despite DTI protestations this weekend, the Champion prosecution does not contradict evidence of a policy change. His was an open-and-shut case: he admitted the charges. So since the election, there has still been no prosecution mounted in a case where the suspects contested the charges. </p> <p>Champion now faces a maximum seven years in prison but, if history is a guide, he has little to fear. The biggest fine ever levied in the UK has been \u00a325,000. And in the past 20 years, only one person has been jailed, serving just nine months. </p> <p>The contrast with the US can hardly be greater. There, the SEC has forced insider dealers to pay over billions of dollars in ill-gotten gains. Junk-bond king Michael Milken was fined $600m and jailed for 10 years. Arch insider dealer Ivan Boesky, whose information to the SEC led to Milken and the Guinness share-dealing inquiry in the UK, was also dealt with severely. </p> <p>In 1997, a great song and dance was made of the planned new statutory framework to regulate the City. The FSA was hailed as the UK's equivalent of the SEC, armed with identical powers to levy fines, with a burden of proof lower than in criminal prosecutions. Since then, however, following powerful lobbying led by big City law firms representing banks and brokers, the FSA's powers and enforcement procedures have been emasculated. </p> <p>Last week's attempts in the House of Lords to split Howard Davies's role as chairman and chief executive of the FSA were just the latest in a long assault on the new regime. So, too, was a government defeat by Tory peers which chips away at the FSA's statutory immunity from prosecution itself. </p> <p>The Bill returns to the Lords this week, with further defeats likely. As a result, the new laws, intended for this summer, may be delayed until early next year. A further battle is also raging over the FSA's draft code of conduct, which defines 'market abuse' in the first place. The City, used to cosy self-regulation, is simply trying to protect its way of life. But the side-effect, say frustrated regulators, is that the villains will be just as hard to punish. </p> <p>The case of the fugitive porn queen also demonstrates fundamental differences in the character of the regulators themselves. The probe, spearheaded by SEC staff lawyer Lionel Andre, was prompted in mid-1997 by suspicious dealings during a huge banking merger. </p> <p>It has already led to two other separate trials of Wall Street traders. A swift series of subpoenas uncovered the starlet's accounts and led to the bank president. Plea-bargaining by her associate, who expects a reduced sentence, led to charges being levelled last December - little more than two years later. </p> <p>Here, the regulators are hardly known for their innovative, undercover approach or speed of enquiry. </p> <p>Vested interests would like them to remain that way.</p>",

Given the occasion, it should surely have been a small-batch bourbon, though Parsons missed that trick. Small-batch bourbons have been in fashionable bars for a year or two, but gradually they are beginning to appear in shops, not only London specialists such as the Vintage house and Milroy's but also department stores.</p> <p>The image of bourbon as the firewater of the cowboy or the gangster has always been a mixed blessing and scarcely fits the small-batch bottlings. Some are sufficiently complex to suit the least macho man or boy, woman or girl. Take Baker's. Its flowery bouquet reminds me of violets and there is a suggestion of brandy snap in the palate. Or Basil Hayden's: the colour is a pinkish gold, the bouquet flowery and rose-like, the palate fruity and creamy with suggestions of chocolate. Only when water is added do I find a suggestion of cigar-smoke. Blanton's has a more purply tinge, the aroma of Turkish delight, a date-like flavour and a mint-tea finish. The best-known example, Booker's, has an orangey colour, a delicate aroma, a luscious, tongue-coating, vanilla-pod flavour - and long, lingering finish.</p> <p>The small batches prove something that connoisseurs have always known, but about which other drinkers have been less confident: you don't have to labour in a Scottish glen to make a fine distillate. Whisky (the Scottish and Canadian spelling) and whiskey (the Irish and US way) are but different members of the same family. This is not a competition between Celtic magic and frontier spirit. Emigrants from Scotland and Ireland were largely responsible for the introduction of whiskey-distilling in North America, but found different grains in the New World.</p> <p>Scotch whiskies taste of malted barley, heather, peat and sometimes the briney, seaweedy shores where they were matured. Irish has a grassier, oilier flavour from unmalted barley. Canadians have a rye tinge, while in American whiskies, the dominant flavour is corn (maize), leavened with rye or wheat.</p> <p>In all whiskies or whiskeys, much is also contributed by the wood used in maturation. In the early days of US distilling, whiskey produced in Kentucky, and shipped in barrels from a port in Bourbon County to New Orleans, gained its oaky character en route. Today, every batch is matured in new oak. The sweetness of the corn is enriched by a vanilla-like component of the oak.</p> <p>While maturation in Scotland takes place in a cool, damp climate, the warehouses in Kentucky can become very hot. In consequence, while Scots distillers lose alcohol to the 'angels', Kentuckians merely lose water. Not only the strength, but also the flavours of their whisky can concentrate during ageing.</p> <p>When a distillery makes a bottling, it marries from a large range of casks to ensure a consistency of style. In Scotland, a distillery may have a dozen warehouses stretching along the waterfront. The one nearest the water will yield salty-tasting whiskies. Even within one warehouse, casks at ground level or in the middle of the building will mature differently from those up high or in a corner, due to different temperatures, degrees of humidity, or draught. Those factors are especially influential in the heat of Kentucky. A small-batch bourbon is bottled from casks reflecting a particular emphasis within the house style.</p> <p>The number of barrels felt to constitute a 'small' batch varies from one distillery to the next, so the credibility of the whole notion rests on the distinctiveness of the bottlings. If there was a definition, consumers might be as willing to pay super-premium prices for small-batch bourbons as they are for single-malt Scotches. Unlike single malts, the bourbons are made from a blend of grains. On the other hand, each bourbon is typically made in a single distillery. In that respect, even the most mainstream bourbons are 'singles'.</p>",

The small batches prove something that connoisseurs have always known, but about which other drinkers have been less confident: you don't have to labour in a Scottish glen to make a fine distillate. Whisky (the Scottish and Canadian spelling) and whiskey (the Irish and US way) are but different members of the same family. This is not a competition between Celtic magic and frontier spirit. Emigrants from Scotland and Ireland were largely responsible for the introduction of whiskey-distilling in North America, but found different grains in the New World. Scotch whiskies taste of malted barley, heather, peat and sometimes the briney, seaweedy shores where they were matured. Irish has a grassier, oilier flavour from unmalted barley. Canadians have a rye tinge, while in American whiskies, the dominant flavour is corn (maize), leavened with rye or wheat. In all whiskies or whiskeys, much is also contributed by the wood used in maturation. In the early days of US distilling, whiskey produced in Kentucky, and shipped in barrels from a port in Bourbon County to New Orleans, gained its oaky character en route. Today, every batch is matured in new oak. The sweetness of the corn is enriched by a vanilla-like component of the oak. While maturation in Scotland takes place in a cool, damp climate, the warehouses in Kentucky can become very hot. In consequence, while Scots distillers lose alcohol to the 'angels', Kentuckians merely lose water. Not only the strength, but also the flavours of their whisky can concentrate during ageing. When a distillery makes a bottling, it marries from a large range of casks to ensure a consistency of style. In Scotland, a distillery may have a dozen warehouses stretching along the waterfront. The one nearest the water will yield salty-tasting whiskies. Even within one warehouse, casks at ground level or in the middle of the building will mature differently from those up high or in a corner, due to different temperatures, degrees of humidity, or draught. Those factors are especially influential in the heat of Kentucky. A small-batch bourbon is bottled from casks reflecting a particular emphasis within the house style. The number of barrels felt to constitute a 'small' batch varies from one distillery to the next, so the credibility of the whole notion rests on the distinctiveness of the bottlings. If there was a definition, consumers might be as willing to pay super-premium prices for small-batch bourbons as they are for single-malt Scotches. Unlike single malts, the bourbons are made from a blend of grains. On the other hand, each bourbon is typically made in a single distillery. In that respect, even the most mainstream bourbons are 'singles'.",

If you've never visited one, imagine being inside a crazy digestive system with brilliantly coloured plastic intestines disgorging children in all directions. The air smells of socks and there are probably no windows. Parents are usually banned from joining in - and are visibly relieved, glad to be able to sit back and watch the children enjoy themselves in a safe environment. </p> <p>So what was my problem? Why did I shudder to think of my children looking back on their childhood only to recall the Pirate Playhouse, off the Holloway Road? It wasn't that it pays only the most perfunctory, passing and plastic tribute to pirates. I've put it down to claustrophobia - and I don't just mean the airless atmosphere. Play itself has become stultified, because adults are policing children's play much more than they ever used to. </p> <p>When I was a child, soft play centres didn't exist and parents didn't worry in the way they do now. We played out of sight, and were glad to be free. But now children are never out of our sight, and these centres offer parents a padded cell. Like hamsters in a cage, our children play obliviously on wheels and slides. Safety is what counts. But safety and imagination were never the best of friends. </p> <p>Take the wave machine - a fairly recent innovation - to be found in modern indoor swimming pools. It's a perfect symbol of what's happening. Here comes the wave: it is regular, it is supervised, always the same height and fun to jump over - in a limited way. But it's nothing like the sea. For some children, these machines will be their only experience of waves. The sea is too dangerous, irregular and hard to supervise. It's like imagination. </p> <p>Of course, soft play centres and indoor pools are convenient. This is partly the point. Play is structured now to make life easy for adults - often at children's expense. We have 'junk play' in the same way that we have junk food. It goes down a treat, but we all know it's second best. </p> <p>Toys are the same, treated as if they were disposable - 'instant', even. Children play with them for a day - if you're lucky - then discard them. When I was a child, my toys were cherished and lasted for years. Today, there must be toy cupboards all over Britain full of plastic detritus, fallout from Christmas and birthdays. </p> <p>Michael Rosen illustrates the problem in his poem 'Keith's Cupboard': In it/there's trucks, and garages, and tents/ and cranes and forts and bikes and puppets/and games, and models and superhero suits/and hats and/he never plays with any of it_ They keep buying him all this stuff/and he never plays with any of it. </p> <p>German research suggests that children would do better if we stopped buying them all this stuff. I was reminded of this recently when my three-year-old twins played a game in which they wrapped up their despised old toys and presented them to each other. The toys were opened with joy and thanks, and the twins were obsessed with the game for a whole week The idea of the toy was far more interesting than the toy itself. </p> <p>Some toys are so ugly it's no wonder that children reject them. But far more disturbing than any aesthetic concern is the content of the games on offer to them now, the problem being one of over-aggressive imagination management. Pok\u00e9mon, for example, has been so comprehensively over-imagined by its creator that it leaves children powerless. And even the quality of this adult imagination is poor: it is violent and twee at the same time. Younger Pok\u00e9mon collectors can do little with the cards other than stare at them, swap them or steal them. </p> <p>And more keeps turning out to mean less. PlayStation and Nintendo games, for example, leave nothing to the imagination. At holiday villages such as Center Parcs, generally regarded as a paradise for children, everything is laid on. Theme parks are no better. Legoland, Chessington and Alton Towers offer a staggering variety of rides - and no need for children to think at all. They react with passive excitement (a very modern state), and parents are grateful: these places make everything so easy.

Already considered pass\u00e9 and, frankly, time-consuming are personal pronouns ('am not illiterate') and complete words like 'would' ('wd') or 'with' ('w/'). Emails will get ever-more frequent until the functional bugging of 'You got mail' signs is replaced by 'You got no mail, but that's OK, I still love you'. Welcome to the age of the solitary beep, where the perfect email will say - proclamations of love and lust aside - 'Can I come and talk to you, please?'",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The news that Elaine Paige is about to star in The King and I had me hyperventilating into a paper bag for some time. Elaine Paige singing Rodgers and Hammerstein - how can I put this? [Keep calm; control urge to gibber; count to 10.] I am very happy to concede that Elaine Paige is one of the greatest interpreters of Andrew Lloyd Webber ever born. Everyone agrees that her Evita was a triumph and Mark Steyn says she is by far the best of all the Norma Desmonds he's seen. I know for a fact that there are many people who can listen to her rendition of 'Memory' from Cats not only without earplugs but with positive pleasure. Fine, by all means give her that. Elaine Paige belting out Andrew Lloyd Webber, no probs, tickety-boo, take it away, Elaine.</p> <p>But Rodgers and Hammerstein - we are talking sacred ground here. Admittedly, The King and I is not the greatest of their musicals, but it has, at the very least, charm and grace and lyricism and a light touch and all the things one doesn't readily associate with Andrew Lloyd Webber. Or indeed with Elaine Paige.</p> <p>Thus my first question to Elaine Paige about how it felt to sing Rodgers and Hammerstein after all those years singing Andrew Lloyd Webber came through gritted teeth. If she'd said it seemed a bit boring, I might have had to bite her. But actually her answer gave me hope: 'I find it more difficult. It's more formal. I keep thinking I'm sounding like Julie Andrews - I'm sure I'm not - but one has to be more conscious of the vowel sounds and singing, as well as speaking, in Received English. And musically, it's much more lyrical. The tunes sweep about more. You know that a woman has a break in her voice - you have a chest register and then you go over the break and you're up in the soprano or mezzo-soprano area, so one is having to negotiate that much more.</p> <p>'And it's a quieter kind of singing, more controlled, not belting it out. There are moments where I feel I want to sing out, but in a different way. So it's all proving rather a challenge, really, but I'm enjoying it.'</p> <p>Passed with flying colours - I almost want to hug her. I never expected to like her at all - she has quite a reputation for being difficult and once told a male interviewer that she would no longer give interviews to female journalists because 'I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time.' But actually I found her chatty, friendly, good humoured. She knows she's not the brightest cookie in the jar - she failed her 11-plus, went to secondary modern and then to stage school - but she seems to have her head screwed on. Tim Rice, in his autobiography, talked about her 'strange combination of sparky confidence and self- deprecating modesty', and that seems accurate - one minute she is being the star, the next she is little miss ordinary from Barnet. I think the thing is, she knows what she knows. She is confident when she talks about singing and stagecraft, surprisingly diffident when it comes to anything outside her field.</p> <p>She is, I suppose, the nearest we have to a great British musical star, since the other great British musical star, Julie Andrews, shoved off to the States several decades ago. And her apartment is satisfyingly starry, with glorious views of the Thames, and lots of black lacquer and leopardskin furniture, and a Yamaha grand piano and acres of bare wooden floor on which, she says, she practises her polka for The King and I in the nude every morning. There are no books in sight, but tons of those peculiar awards and trophies that stars accumulate - heart-shaped ones from the Variety Club and a rather pretty abstract from the Chickenshed children's charity for 'inspiration' - and rows of silver-framed photographs of her meeting the Queen, the Queen Mother, Michael Caine, Roger Moore, Peter Hall, Freddie Mercury, and so on. There is a photograph of her sister and her niece. But, of course, no wedding shots, no children, because Elaine Paige is still, at 52, a spinster of this parish.</p> <p><b> I hadn't thought till I read Elaine Paige's</b> cuttings what a very odd job being a musical star is. I kept thinking: where's the career? How can someone be so well known on the basis of so few roles? She made her West End debut in Hair in 1969 and had minor roles in Jesus Christ Superstar , Grease and Billy ; she became a star with Evita in 1978; then she did Cats in 1983, Chess in 1986, Anything Goes in 1989, Piaf in 1993, and took over from Betty Buckley in Sunset Boulevard in 1994. But that's it - fewer than a dozen roles. But Andrew Lloyd Webber told her that Mary Martin was a star on the basis of only three roles, and she feels she's had her fair share.</p> <p>Her last singing role in Britain was in Sunset Boulevard in 1995, then she appeared in a straight play, Le Misanthrope , in 1998. But since then she's been 'resting', doing the odd concert here and there, and recording an album, currently on hold. Two years ago, she seemed to imply she was giving up musicals for good - 'I feel I've got nothing left to prove where musicals are concerned' - and said she was going to concentrate on straight theatre. She often says that she regards herself as an actress first and a singer second, though you wouldn't suspect it from reading her CV. But she admits that when she did Le Misanthrope , 'I did miss the music a bit - but only in the wings, when I was waiting to go on. It seemed dreadfully quiet, rather unnerving. But the wonderful thing was that one didn't have to be quite so obsessive about one's health, and one's voice.'</p> <p>So when the idea of The King and I was first mooted, she turned it down. But her agent told her to have a look at it, listen to the music, read the play - she only dimly recollected having seen the film with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner decades ago. 'So I thought: \"Oh all right, just to keep him quiet, I will\", and I played the Broadway album and I had forgotten what a fantastic score it was. I mean, each song, one after the other - you go, \"Oh gosh, is that in it?\" \"Oh, that's a good one!\" So I was sitting there thinking: \"Crikey, this is a jolly good score\", and then I read the play - and I hate reading plays, it's so boring usually. But I started reading, and I got quicker and quicker because it was really holding my attention. It is the most wonderful story, and by the end I was in floods of tears, it's so sad. And I was rather shocked at my own response, and I thought: \"I think I really would rather love to do this.\"'</p> <p>She has signed up to do The King and I for a year, though with a get-out clause after nine months. She didn't really want to commit for so long, but having been a producer herself (she co-produced Anything Goes with Tim Rice in 1989), she is aware of the costs of staging a big musical and the amount of time it takes to break even. 'It's a very luscious, beautifully designed show with a huge cast, so the outlay is enormous - I think it's \u00a34 or \u00a35 million. Not that that's my problem, but I am aware of it. And also, you know, I think: \"Well if you're going to do it, give it a bash.\"'</p> <p>But once before, she signed up for a year and then had to drop out. This was in 1993, with Piaf - a very demanding piece, by Pam Gems, in which she was onstage for two hours 40 minutes, acting Edith Piaf from age 16 to her death, and singing 15 songs, some in French, which she had to learn phonetically. It was a great critical triumph and upped her acting credibility several notches, but in the end it drove her to breakdown. 'Oh, it was awful, and I vowed to myself I would never, ever push myself to the edge that much again. It was really frightening. Because absolutely everything seemed to be impossible to deal with, just little things became major - noise, if someone had a radio on, or even the sound of traffic, or being in someone's company for longer than 10 minutes - I started to find it all too much.'</p> <p>Eventually she turned up at Champneys one weekend - she was in the habit of going there straight after the Saturday performance and sleeping through till Monday - and burst into tears. 'And I could not stop. There was no real reason to weep, but I was just so tired. And the nursing staff said, \"We really think we should call your doctor\", and he came out there to see me and said, \"You're not going back. You're absolutely exhausted and you've got to stop, otherwise you will be seriously ill.\" So basically that was it. It was the most terrible, terrible time. I'm not a person that gives in. I consider myself to be quite a sturdy person; I'm not a quitter. So there was an awful guilt attached to it - but I knew he was right, because I couldn't walk I was so tired. I've never known an experience like that ever, before or since. And I don't intend to ever go there again. I learned then that I would have to re-evaluate things and balance my life better.'</p> <p>So she rested for a few months and then, by another of these odd happenstances that seem to be part of her career, she was asked to take over in Sunset Boulevard when Betty Buckley was ill. But wasn't she rather miffed not to get Sunset Boulevard in the first place? She actually sang a song from it before anyone else - Lloyd Webber rang her just before his marriage to Madeleine in 1991 and said he'd written this brilliant song and could she sing it at his wedding? It was 'With One Look', though at that time it was called 'Just One Glance'. So she sang it at the wedding and then, she claims, forgot about it.</p> <p>But why didn't she ask him what show the song was intended for - why didn't she clamour for the role? 'I suppose I could have done. I was foolish. It didn't enter my head. I'm not particularly pushy that way - you'd have to be pretty eye to the main chance, to do that. It's a bit daft of me in retrospect. But - dumb dumb dumb - I don't behave like that. I mean, he must have known what he was writing, and one would have liked to imagine that if he thought I was suitable for the role he would have asked me to play it - but maybe that's not always the case.' Or maybe you were meant to be begging for it? 'Lynn!' - and she laughs her strange dirty cackle - 'you could have just turned me on to a new way of getting some meaty roles for myself!'</p> <p>Whatever - she had to sit through the first night of Sunset Boulevard thinking: 'I would love to play this part' but never dreaming she would be asked to. And then Betty Buckley had to have an operation and Lloyd Webber asked her to take over. 'It was not long after the Piaf experience, and I remember thinking, \"Oh, all those stairs !\" Which is ludicrous, really, because one does not judge whether you take a musical role on the basis of how many stairs you have to climb - though there were an awful lot! But that first night, yes, I thought: \"This is a role I would love to play\", so I'm glad that I did in the end and had such a personal success with it.'</p> <p><b> She filled in for Betty Buckley for a few</b> weeks in 1994, then took over the role properly in 1995, had a successful run in London, and then finally played it in New York, breaking what had seemed like an 18-year jinx on her ever getting to Broadway. She first hoped to go with Evita , in 1978, then with Cats , then with Chess , but each time her hopes were raised, only to be dashed. Anyway, Broadway fully lived up to her expectations. 'And more! I thought: \"Gosh, it really has been worth the wait.\" And I think had I gone with Evita , I probably wouldn't have been ready to deal with it. It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show.'</p> <p>She played Norma Desmond for nine months, then stayed on in New York enjoying herself and going to all the plays and parties and 'really living the glamorous New York theatre life'. But eventually she got homesick for her English friends and family and came back. She sold her five-storey house in Chelsea - all those stairs! - and bought her present apartment. 'I said, \"I'm going to take six months off, I'm going to travel, go to the theatre, see my friends, have dinner parties, lead a real, normal life, have a few glasses of wine when I feel like it\" - because obviously when I'm singing I can't drink. And everyone said to me, \"Oh, you'll get fed up in three weeks, you'll be bored.\" And I said, \"I don't think so.\" And I wasn't. And, in fact, at the end of the six months, I thought: \"To hell with it, I'll take another six months off.\" So basically I had a year's sabbatical, and it was wonderful.'</p> <p>But she still dithers about whether to stay in England, and says she might go back to New York when she finishes in The King and I . 'I do love it over there - I feel a different person when I'm in America. I love the energy, and it seems easier to gather people up at the last minute and say, \"Let's go rollerblading in the park\" - I had lots of friends that I could sort of play with over there. And there's a sense of freedom that somehow I don't seem to have here. I can't quite put it into words, but I think you're allowed to be whoever you want to be over there, and there isn't the class thing.'</p> <p>She often mentions 'the class thing' and complains that the English are generally snobbish about musical theatre, and perhaps extra snobbish about her. She told the Daily Mail a couple of years ago: 'I've never played the game socially, never pretended to be something I'm not.' I guess she is mystified - as I am, slightly - by the number of articles that refer to her as 'suburban'. Of course she does come from the suburbs - she grew up in Barnet, north London, where her father was an estate agent.</p> <p>But then loads of actresses, singers, writers, not to mention yours truly, come from the suburbs without being eternally branded as suburban. I think it has more to do with aspirations and taste than with geographical or class origins, and in that sense I suppose Elaine Paige is suburban. She is relentlessly middlebrow, commonsensical, down to earth, intellectually incurious. She doesn't read. She told me that in her teens her music teacher tried to interest her in opera and suggested she would be good in Mozart, 'but I thought it was rather an elite world that somebody from my background wouldn't go into. It's odd, isn't it, when you look back on your life and think, \"What would have happened had I made that choice? I could have ended up down a completely different road.\"'</p> <p>Yup - maybe she could have, though she's not weeping buckets over the thought that she might have been Kiri Te Kanawa. She told me that she'd been to hear Rene Fleming sing Rosenkavalier the other night and 'it was wonderful, but I made a note of what time she started singing - it was an hour and a quarter, that first act, and she does not stop , and I just thought, \"Crikey, it would take me a week to recover from this.\"'</p> <p>It is typical of her to think of the work rather than the art. She makes her job sound like working at the coalface. She goes into training beforehand - gives up drink and dairy products (she gave up smoking some time ago) - concentrates on keeping fit and sleeping a lot. At the beginning of a run, she says, she can sometimes have lunch with friends, but after a few months, when her voice is beginning to tire, she gives up social life completely and sometimes has to give up speaking, communicating only by notepad and fax.</p> <p>She admits, 'When you asked how long I'd be doing The King and I , and I said a year, I thought, \"Omigod, it sounds like a prison sentence\" - you know it's going to encroach on your entire life. You go into a sort of athletic mode where you try and become superfit and stay that way, because what it really amounts to, doing this kind of work, is stamina. And so one becomes, or I become, anyway, slightly obsessive, particularly about my health, because you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed - it's so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there.</p> <p>'This is the difference between acting in a play and singing in a musical - your voice becomes everything. The first thing you do in the morning is sing a few notes to see how you are - the voice is a very fragile thing, and it alters with the weather. If it's a damp, wet day, the likelihood is one will not sing as well, though an air-conditioned, dry atmosphere is the worst . And, of course, you are terrified of catching colds. So you just become completely obsessive and end up living the life of a recluse, pretty much. And that's what becomes boring about it in the end - to do that for 20 years.'</p> <p>It seems rather a lonely life. She had one very public love affair, with Tim Rice, in the 80s, but he dithered so long about leaving his wife Jane that in the end they both dumped him. He did actually start divorce proceedings but never completed them, and is still married to Jane, although he now has a child with another woman. Paige says she has had other relationships after Tim Rice, but none at present. But she doesn't live like a nun - 'There are men in my life - I mean, I have people in my life, I'm not alone .' The tragedy is that when she wanted to have children, in her late thirties, she was tied up with Tim Rice and 'I'm not the kind of person that would have a child on my own; I'm old-fashioned. So because of that, there was no possibility, really, for me to have children.'</p> <p>Perhaps, in the end, it suited her to fall for a man who would never commit because, she says, she is happy living alone. 'I've always been happy with that, and I think possibly that is why I am on my own. For many years, I used to think there must be something wrong with me, that I enjoyed it so much - because most people don't do this, most people cohabit or are married or something - I used to worry that I was slightly abnormal. And now, of course, I've come to the conclusion that it really doesn't matter what other people think, or what the so-called norm is - this is what makes me feel happy and content, so to hell with it.'</p> <p>\u0095 The King and I opens at London's Palladium Theatre (020 7494 5020) on 3 May, with previews from l8 April</p>",

And her apartment is satisfyingly starry, with glorious views of the Thames, and lots of black lacquer and leopardskin furniture, and a Yamaha grand piano and acres of bare wooden floor on which, she says, she practises her polka for The King and I in the nude every morning. There are no books in sight, but tons of those peculiar awards and trophies that stars accumulate - heart-shaped ones from the Variety Club and a rather pretty abstract from the Chickenshed children's charity for 'inspiration' - and rows of silver-framed photographs of her meeting the Queen, the Queen Mother, Michael Caine, Roger Moore, Peter Hall, Freddie Mercury, and so on. There is a photograph of her sister and her niece. But, of course, no wedding shots, no children, because Elaine Paige is still, at 52, a spinster of this parish. I hadn't thought till I read Elaine Paige's cuttings what a very odd job being a musical star is. I kept thinking: where's the career? How can someone be so well known on the basis of so few roles? She made her West End debut in Hair in 1969 and had minor roles in Jesus Christ Superstar , Grease and Billy ; she became a star with Evita in 1978; then she did Cats in 1983, Chess in 1986, Anything Goes in 1989, Piaf in 1993, and took over from Betty Buckley in Sunset Boulevard in 1994. But that's it - fewer than a dozen roles. But Andrew Lloyd Webber told her that Mary Martin was a star on the basis of only three roles, and she feels she's had her fair share. Her last singing role in Britain was in Sunset Boulevard in 1995, then she appeared in a straight play, Le Misanthrope , in 1998. But since then she's been 'resting', doing the odd concert here and there, and recording an album, currently on hold. Two years ago, she seemed to imply she was giving up musicals for good - 'I feel I've got nothing left to prove where musicals are concerned' - and said she was going to concentrate on straight theatre. She often says that she regards herself as an actress first and a singer second, though you wouldn't suspect it from reading her CV. But she admits that when she did Le Misanthrope , 'I did miss the music a bit - but only in the wings, when I was waiting to go on. It seemed dreadfully quiet, rather unnerving. But the wonderful thing was that one didn't have to be quite so obsessive about one's health, and one's voice.' So when the idea of The King and I was first mooted, she turned it down. But her agent told her to have a look at it, listen to the music, read the play - she only dimly recollected having seen the film with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner decades ago. 'So I thought: \"Oh all right, just to keep him quiet, I will\", and I played the Broadway album and I had forgotten what a fantastic score it was. I mean, each song, one after the other - you go, \"Oh gosh, is that in it?\" \"Oh, that's a good one!\" So I was sitting there thinking: \"Crikey, this is a jolly good score\", and then I read the play - and I hate reading plays, it's so boring usually. But I started reading, and I got quicker and quicker because it was really holding my attention. It is the most wonderful story, and by the end I was in floods of tears, it's so sad. And I was rather shocked at my own response, and I thought: \"I think I really would rather love to do this.\"' She has signed up to do The King and I for a year, though with a get-out clause after nine months. She didn't really want to commit for so long, but having been a producer herself (she co-produced Anything Goes with Tim Rice in 1989), she is aware of the costs of staging a big musical and the amount of time it takes to break even. 'It's a very luscious, beautifully designed show with a huge cast, so the outlay is enormous - I think it's \u00a34 or \u00a35 million. Not that that's my problem, but I am aware of it. And also, you know, I think: \"Well if you're going to do it, give it a bash.\"' But once before, she signed up for a year and then had to drop out. This was in 1993, with Piaf - a very demanding piece, by Pam Gems, in which she was onstage for two hours 40 minutes, acting Edith Piaf from age 16 to her death, and singing 15 songs, some in French, which she had to learn phonetically. It was a great critical triumph and upped her acting credibility several notches, but in the end it drove her to breakdown. 'Oh, it was awful, and I vowed to myself I would never, ever push myself to the edge that much again. It was really frightening. Because absolutely everything seemed to be impossible to deal with, just little things became major - noise, if someone had a radio on, or even the sound of traffic, or being in someone's company for longer than 10 minutes - I started to find it all too much.' Eventually she turned up at Champneys one weekend - she was in the habit of going there straight after the Saturday performance and sleeping through till Monday - and burst into tears. 'And I could not stop. There was no real reason to weep, but I was just so tired. And the nursing staff said, \"We really think we should call your doctor\", and he came out there to see me and said, \"You're not going back. You're absolutely exhausted and you've got to stop, otherwise you will be seriously ill.\" So basically that was it. It was the most terrible, terrible time. I'm not a person that gives in. I consider myself to be quite a sturdy person; I'm not a quitter. So there was an awful guilt attached to it - but I knew he was right, because I couldn't walk I was so tired. I've never known an experience like that ever, before or since. And I don't intend to ever go there again. I learned then that I would have to re-evaluate things and balance my life better.' So she rested for a few months and then, by another of these odd happenstances that seem to be part of her career, she was asked to take over in Sunset Boulevard when Betty Buckley was ill. But wasn't she rather miffed not to get Sunset Boulevard in the first place? She actually sang a song from it before anyone else - Lloyd Webber rang her just before his marriage to Madeleine in 1991 and said he'd written this brilliant song and could she sing it at his wedding? It was 'With One Look', though at that time it was called 'Just One Glance'. So she sang it at the wedding and then, she claims, forgot about it. But why didn't she ask him what show the song was intended for - why didn't she clamour for the role? 'I suppose I could have done. I was foolish. It didn't enter my head. I'm not particularly pushy that way - you'd have to be pretty eye to the main chance, to do that. It's a bit daft of me in retrospect. But - dumb dumb dumb - I don't behave like that. I mean, he must have known what he was writing, and one would have liked to imagine that if he thought I was suitable for the role he would have asked me to play it - but maybe that's not always the case.' Or maybe you were meant to be begging for it? 'Lynn!' - and she laughs her strange dirty cackle - 'you could have just turned me on to a new way of getting some meaty roles for myself!' Whatever - she had to sit through the first night of Sunset Boulevard thinking: 'I would love to play this part' but never dreaming she would be asked to. And then Betty Buckley had to have an operation and Lloyd Webber asked her to take over. 'It was not long after the Piaf experience, and I remember thinking, \"Oh, all those stairs !\" Which is ludicrous, really, because one does not judge whether you take a musical role on the basis of how many stairs you have to climb - though there were an awful lot! But that first night, yes, I thought: \"This is a role I would love to play\", so I'm glad that I did in the end and had such a personal success with it.' She filled in for Betty Buckley for a few weeks in 1994, then took over the role properly in 1995, had a successful run in London, and then finally played it in New York, breaking what had seemed like an 18-year jinx on her ever getting to Broadway. She first hoped to go with Evita , in 1978, then with Cats , then with Chess , but each time her hopes were raised, only to be dashed. Anyway, Broadway fully lived up to her expectations. 'And more! I thought: \"Gosh, it really has been worth the wait.\" And I think had I gone with Evita , I probably wouldn't have been ready to deal with it. It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show.' She played Norma Desmond for nine months, then stayed on in New York enjoying herself and going to all the plays and parties and 'really living the glamorous New York theatre life'. But eventually she got homesick for her English friends and family and came back. She sold her five-storey house in Chelsea - all those stairs! - and bought her present apartment. 'I said, \"I'm going to take six months off, I'm going to travel, go to the theatre, see my friends, have dinner parties, lead a real, normal life, have a few glasses of wine when I feel like it\" - because obviously when I'm singing I can't drink. And everyone said to me, \"Oh, you'll get fed up in three weeks, you'll be bored.\" And I said, \"I don't think so.\" And I wasn't. And, in fact, at the end of the six months, I thought: \"To hell with it, I'll take another six months off.\" So basically I had a year's sabbatical, and it was wonderful.' But she still dithers about whether to stay in England, and says she might go back to New York when she finishes in The King and I . 'I do love it over there - I feel a different person when I'm in America. I love the energy, and it seems easier to gather people up at the last minute and say, \"Let's go rollerblading in the park\" - I had lots of friends that I could sort of play with over there. And there's a sense of freedom that somehow I don't seem to have here. I can't quite put it into words, but I think you're allowed to be whoever you want to be over there, and there isn't the class thing.' She often mentions 'the class thing' and complains that the English are generally snobbish about musical theatre, and perhaps extra snobbish about her. She told the Daily Mail a couple of years ago: 'I've never played the game socially, never pretended to be something I'm not.' I guess she is mystified - as I am, slightly - by the number of articles that refer to her as 'suburban'. Of course she does come from the suburbs - she grew up in Barnet, north London, where her father was an estate agent. But then loads of actresses, singers, writers, not to mention yours truly, come from the suburbs without being eternally branded as suburban. I think it has more to do with aspirations and taste than with geographical or class origins, and in that sense I suppose Elaine Paige is suburban. She is relentlessly middlebrow, commonsensical, down to earth, intellectually incurious. She doesn't read. She told me that in her teens her music teacher tried to interest her in opera and suggested she would be good in Mozart, 'but I thought it was rather an elite world that somebody from my background wouldn't go into. It's odd, isn't it, when you look back on your life and think, \"What would have happened had I made that choice? I could have ended up down a completely different road.\"' Yup - maybe she could have, though she's not weeping buckets over the thought that she might have been Kiri Te Kanawa. She told me that she'd been to hear Rene Fleming sing Rosenkavalier the other night and 'it was wonderful, but I made a note of what time she started singing - it was an hour and a quarter, that first act, and she does not stop , and I just thought, \"Crikey, it would take me a week to recover from this.\"' It is typical of her to think of the work rather than the art. She makes her job sound like working at the coalface. She goes into training beforehand - gives up drink and dairy products (she gave up smoking some time ago) - concentrates on keeping fit and sleeping a lot. At the beginning of a run, she says, she can sometimes have lunch with friends, but after a few months, when her voice is beginning to tire, she gives up social life completely and sometimes has to give up speaking, communicating only by notepad and fax. She admits, 'When you asked how long I'd be doing The King and I , and I said a year, I thought, \"Omigod, it sounds like a prison sentence\" - you know it's going to encroach on your entire life. You go into a sort of athletic mode where you try and become superfit and stay that way, because what it really amounts to, doing this kind of work, is stamina. And so one becomes, or I become, anyway, slightly obsessive, particularly about my health, because you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed - it's so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there. 'This is the difference between acting in a play and singing in a musical - your voice becomes everything. The first thing you do in the morning is sing a few notes to see how you are - the voice is a very fragile thing, and it alters with the weather. If it's a damp, wet day, the likelihood is one will not sing as well, though an air-conditioned, dry atmosphere is the worst . And, of course, you are terrified of catching colds. So you just become completely obsessive and end up living the life of a recluse, pretty much. And that's what becomes boring about it in the end - to do that for 20 years.' It seems rather a lonely life. She had one very public love affair, with Tim Rice, in the 80s, but he dithered so long about leaving his wife Jane that in the end they both dumped him. He did actually start divorce proceedings but never completed them, and is still married to Jane, although he now has a child with another woman. Paige says she has had other relationships after Tim Rice, but none at present. But she doesn't live like a nun - 'There are men in my life - I mean, I have people in my life, I'm not alone .' The tragedy is that when she wanted to have children, in her late thirties, she was tied up with Tim Rice and 'I'm not the kind of person that would have a child on my own; I'm old-fashioned. So because of that, there was no possibility, really, for me to have children.' Perhaps, in the end, it suited her to fall for a man who would never commit because, she says, she is happy living alone. 'I've always been happy with that, and I think possibly that is why I am on my own. For many years, I used to think there must be something wrong with me, that I enjoyed it so much - because most people don't do this, most people cohabit or are married or something - I used to worry that I was slightly abnormal. And now, of course, I've come to the conclusion that it really doesn't matter what other people think, or what the so-called norm is - this is what makes me feel happy and content, so to hell with it.' \u0095 The King and I opens at London's Palladium Theatre (020 7494 5020) on 3 May, with previews from l8 April",

He stopped work happily as he felt he was 'becoming less flexible in my dotage'. </strong></p> <p><strong>Initially this gave him more time for playing in the traditional jazz band for which he has been semi-professional saxophonist for 27 years. But now he has made way for younger talent. He still plays occasionally, and has taken up wood turning. </strong></p> <p><strong>His finances have gone less smoothly. His savings have shrunk in value in the past six months, making him wary of equity-linked investments. He explains: 'Disastrously, I lost about \u00a31,500 on a Scottish Mutual offshore bond which cost me \u00a315,000. I cashed it in early because it was losing money, but I had already paid the upfront charges, and had to pay a penalty because I had held it for only three years. I had bought the bond because the previous year it had risen 28 per cent.' </strong></p> <p><strong>He also saw his Halifax Share Pep fall from \u00a33,200 to \u00a31,800 over six months. And he had a Perpetual High Income Bond which lost \u00a3500 in two months. </strong></p> <p><strong>Ken asks: How can I stop the rot?' </strong></p> <p><strong>He took comfort from his setbacks, spending the money from the Perpetual bond on a new three-piece suite and settling his credit card bills. And the Scottish Mutual bond cash went on a motor caravan, which, with his wife Lyn, he is about to take for two months touring France. </strong></p> <p><strong>His main concern is supplementing his income now, as he still has five years to wait before receiving the state pension. Lyn, a non-taxpayer, has three years to go. 'My pension is \u00a3600 a month. I would like an extra \u00a3250 or so.' </strong></p> <p><strong>He plans to use money from other investments, just maturing, to provide this: 'I have a GAN Millennium Bond which matured for \u00a335,000 in March. This was paying income of \u00a3280 a month after tax. I also have a Prudential Prudence Bond of \u00a310,000, which now gives us about \u00a358 a month and which I can take out from March.' Their \u00a370,000 three-bedroom detached house is paid for. As their grown-up sons do not want to inherit, Ken wonders whether they can use the equity to boost their income. </strong></p> <p><strong>Whatever he invests in, he wants to know: 'What can I do to guarantee that I do not lose any more money and have it available, within a week or two, if I decide to spend big quite suddenly?'</strong></p> <p><strong><strong>Adviser 1: Ian Williams</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>The Prudential Prudence Bond should be retained, but taking income above the 5 per cent tax-free threshold will hinder capital growth. Bank shares will come back strongly, so I recommend holding the Halifax shares. </strong></p> <p><strong>Mr and Mrs Duckers should both invest their \u00a37,000 allowance in an Isa. I recommend a corporate bond fund for regular income and possibly capital growth, such as the Mercury High Income Bond Fund. This pays 8 per cent a month, so \u00a314,000 will earn \u00a393 a month tax free. </strong></p> <p><strong>The remaining \u00a321,000 should be invested in another income-producing unit trust, perhaps the Foreign &amp; Colonial Higher Income Plan fund. This also pays 8 per cent but, outside an Isa, the income is 6.4 per cent net or \u00a3112 a month. This gives a total income of \u00a3863 a month net, but with slower capital growth than with a growth fund. </strong></p> <p><strong>One way to release a cash sum from their property is the Norwich Union Flexible Cash Release Plan. It is a loan, maximum 18 per cent, with interest fixed currently at 8.25 per cent, but there are no repayments during their lifetime unless the property is sold. They retain ownership of their home. This could release up to \u00a312,600.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u0095 Ian Williams is a financial adviser with Bath-based Chartwell Investments. </strong></p> <p><strong><strong>Adviser 2: Joanne Cox</strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Mr Duckers' need for immediate access and capital security narrows his choices to bank and building society accounts or National Savings. </strong></p> <p><strong>As Mrs Duckers is a non-taxpayer, they should put some money in her name. She can earn up to her personal allowance of \u00a34,385 a year before paying tax, which would cover their additional income needs. </strong></p> <p><strong>Many monthly interest accounts pay over 6 per cent with instant access, and \u00a335,000 in Mrs Duckers' name provides \u00a3175 a month. National Savings Income Bonds attract 6.25 per cent at three months' notice. </strong></p> <p><strong>However, deposit-based accounts do not provide capital growth. If the Duckers draw all the interest earned, inflation will eat into capital and income, so they should invest for capital growth. As the Prudential Prudence Bond is producing \u00a3696 a year, it is worth holding. If they are uncomfortable with the Halifax Share Pep fluctuating in value, selling may be the best option - but it could be worth keeping as the shares may rise. </strong></p> <p><strong>There are many schemes to realise capital or income from property, but annuity rates are low and their income needs can be met elsewhere. I recommend putting this idea on the back burner. Any plan that allows them to build up debt against property can be restrictive if they should want to move.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u0095 Joanne Cox is a financial adviser with Co-operative Bank. </strong></p> <p><strong> Advice is for guidance only.</strong></p>",

'It was the usual story from the NHS: they were going to take a year or so. I was in some pain and restricted in movement.

Mr White, 78, a retired engineering worker, has undergone two 'self-pay' operations at the Nuffield Wessex, just down the road from his home in Chandlers Ford, between Southampton and Winchester. He first made contact with the Nuffield a year ago when he needed a repair to an old hernia operation. 'It was the usual story from the NHS: they were going to take a year or so. I was in some pain and restricted in movement. My wife and I had booked a six-week holiday in November - and the NHS route didn't fit in with those plans.'

You can't just go around hating 14-year-old Christian boy drummers, however obnoxious they might be.

      "byline": "Jann Parry",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> The Crucible</strong> Royal Opera House, London W2 </p> <p>Focus is vital in any ballet that tells a story. The audience needs clues and signposts, even if we know the plot already from mugging up the programme notes. William Tuckett does provide a scenario for his new one-act ballet, The Crucible , in the Royal Ballet's latest triple bill. He adds a disclaimer, however, absolving himself from following Arthur Miller's play in every aspect. </p> <p>He uses Miller's title, though, instead of adopting an alternative, as Kenneth MacMillan did for his versions of plays or books. Choreographers are not bound to recount a story literally, beginning at the beginning, any more than filmmakers do. But just as the camera guides you where to look, so the dance- maker must direct your attention to key characters and incidents. A stage filled with actions and images is too bewildering to absorb, along with often unfamiliar music - in this case, a collage of Charles Ives pieces. </p> <p>The ballet starts mysteriously, with Ives's The Unanswered Question as a prologue. Ralph Steadman's front cloth is a grotesque portrait of an inbred Puritan community bristling with crucifixes. Through the screen can be seen highlights from the story-so-far: adulterous sex and satanic dances. The cloth lifts to reveal Steadman's nightmare vision of fear and loathing in New Eng land - or maybe England now. This is a society of control freaks and hysterics. Those in command sport crosses like Teletubbies' antennae to keep them on message. </p> <p>The 'possessed' girls are caricatured as vamps or virgins. Abigail, their ringleader, wears a long red Sylvie Guillem wig and flings herself at the leading man, John Proctor, in much the same insatiable way as Mary Vetsera does in MacMillan's Mayerling . Proctor appears to be the only sane person in the place, though it is soon apparent that he is racked with guilt and lust. </p> <p>Tuckett's biggest problem is finding a movement language that expresses Proctor's relationship with his wife, Elizabeth. The scenario, like the play, suggests that her coldness has driven him to adultery, yet Zenaida Yanowsky is stunningly sensual. Her pas de deux with Proctor - Irek Mukhamedov powerful in the first cast, Jonathan Cope more romantic in the second - are full of erotic lifts. The contrast in Proctor's encounters with wife and mistress is mainly a matter of colouring, in acting and expressionist lighting (by Peter Mumford). </p> <p>Shifts of emotion within long pas de deux are hard to follow because the hyper-active set is so distracting. Steadman plays with every device the new stage machinery can accommodate: mobile steel frames, huge shards of plastic, wire fencing, forests of wooden crosses.

      "bodyText": "The Crucible Royal Opera House, London W2 Focus is vital in any ballet that tells a story. The audience needs clues and signposts, even if we know the plot already from mugging up the programme notes. William Tuckett does provide a scenario for his new one-act ballet, The Crucible , in the Royal Ballet's latest triple bill. He adds a disclaimer, however, absolving himself from following Arthur Miller's play in every aspect. He uses Miller's title, though, instead of adopting an alternative, as Kenneth MacMillan did for his versions of plays or books. Choreographers are not bound to recount a story literally, beginning at the beginning, any more than filmmakers do. But just as the camera guides you where to look, so the dance- maker must direct your attention to key characters and incidents. A stage filled with actions and images is too bewildering to absorb, along with often unfamiliar music - in this case, a collage of Charles Ives pieces. The ballet starts mysteriously, with Ives's The Unanswered Question as a prologue. Ralph Steadman's front cloth is a grotesque portrait of an inbred Puritan community bristling with crucifixes. Through the screen can be seen highlights from the story-so-far: adulterous sex and satanic dances. The cloth lifts to reveal Steadman's nightmare vision of fear and loathing in New Eng land - or maybe England now. This is a society of control freaks and hysterics. Those in command sport crosses like Teletubbies' antennae to keep them on message. The 'possessed' girls are caricatured as vamps or virgins. Abigail, their ringleader, wears a long red Sylvie Guillem wig and flings herself at the leading man, John Proctor, in much the same insatiable way as Mary Vetsera does in MacMillan's Mayerling . Proctor appears to be the only sane person in the place, though it is soon apparent that he is racked with guilt and lust. Tuckett's biggest problem is finding a movement language that expresses Proctor's relationship with his wife, Elizabeth. The scenario, like the play, suggests that her coldness has driven him to adultery, yet Zenaida Yanowsky is stunningly sensual. Her pas de deux with Proctor - Irek Mukhamedov powerful in the first cast, Jonathan Cope more romantic in the second - are full of erotic lifts. The contrast in Proctor's encounters with wife and mistress is mainly a matter of colouring, in acting and expressionist lighting (by Peter Mumford). Shifts of emotion within long pas de deux are hard to follow because the hyper-active set is so distracting. Steadman plays with every device the new stage machinery can accommodate: mobile steel frames, huge shards of plastic, wire fencing, forests of wooden crosses. Demonic silhouettes leer from the undergrowth, overwhelming the purely human drama of bigotry and betrayal. Tantalisingly, Miller's allegorical story, based on accounts of witch hunts in seventeenth-century Salem, is in there somewhere. Having re-read the play between the ballet's first two performances, I could then identify characters and motives; with out that detailed information, I was flummoxed. Tuckett's eloquence (which reads better on the second cast than the first) goes for nothing if the tragedy is incomprehensible.",

Good news for morning rush-hour drivers, bad news for adult filmgoers. The three children's offerings this week cannot in any sense be said to be family entertainment, as they'd test the patience of the most indulgent parents and grandparents. Because kids will watch anything, it behoves us to give them the best, and this trio of pictures falls far short. What they share, apart from their indifferent quality, is a hybrid character, Ast\u00e9rix and Ob\u00e9lix Take on Caesar being a French comedy dubbed into English, Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie a Japanese cartoon reworked for Americans, and The Tigger Movie a set of British characters animated by teams of Americans and Japanese. </p> <p>By some way the worst, <strong> Pok\u00e9mon</strong> is a movie spin-off from the Game Boy game and TV series and it pits the megalomaniac pocket monster MewTwo against the benign Pok\u00e9monMew from whose DNA he has been cloned. At stake is world control and MewTwo's gang face off against assorted Pok\u00e9mon and their human trainers. Crudely drawn, as if by an untalented follower of Maurice Sendak, this is sententious stuff ('It's what you do with the gift of life that determines what you are'). By comparison, Teletubbies looks like an early work by Jane Austen. </p> <p><strong> Ast\u00e9rix and Ob\u00e9lix</strong> is a live-action version of the cheerful French comic strip that began in 1959, and stars Christian Clavier as the patriotic Gaul Ast\u00e9rix combating Caesar's Romans with the help of a secret potion and his thick sidekick Ob\u00e9lix (G\u00e9rard Depardieu). It is leaden stuff that hasn't been transmuted into a Life of Brian by engaging Terry Jones to write the English dialogue and do the dubbing for Depardieu. All the accents are jokily British with the exception of the Chico Marx Italian accent used for Roberto Benigni's Detritus. There is one brilliant, hair-raising sequence in which Ast\u00e9rix runs the gauntlet of snakes, lions, crocodiles and tarantulas in a Roman arena. </p> <p><strong> The Tigger Movie</strong> is much inferior to Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, the charming 25-minute cartoon closely based on E.H. Shepard's illustrations that brought the Disney Studio an Oscar in 1968. Rather coarsely drawn, it centres on the vainglorious bouncing Tigger as he searches the Hundred Acre Wood for his relatives, only to discover that Pooh, Roo, Eeyore and company are his real family. The one highlight is the song 'Round My Family Tree' that features various Tigger ancestors as painted by Whistler, Dali, Picasso and Van Gogh and dancing in 'Goldtiggers of Broadway'. </p> <p>Two French movies of a certain quality approach the subject of obsessive love from different angles. C\u00e9dric Khan's <strong> L'Ennui</strong>, adapted from Alberto Moravia's novel La Noia (previously filmed in Rome in 1964 as The Empty Canvas with Bette Davis), centres on Martin, a divorced Parisian philosophy professor (Charles Berling) who falls for the plump, vacuous, sexually voracious 17-year-old Cecilia (Sophie Guillemin) after discovering she's driven a middle-aged painter to his grave. </p> <p>His inability to possess and dominate Cecilia, his vain attempts to make her reject her young black lover, his involvement of his detached ex-wife (Arielle Dombasle) in his self-searching, are the stuff of tragi-comedy. Berling constantly loses and regains our sympathy. </p> <p>As he dashes dementedly around Paris, phoning, driving, having frenetic sex, Martin cuts a touching figure. His female counterpart in <strong> La Nouvelle Eve</strong> is the frenetic Camille (Karen Viard), an intelligent, discontented, unattached woman also in her thirties and underemployed as a swimming pool attendant. She too falls in love with an unprepossessing object of desire, a short, bald, happily married Socialist Party organiser (Pierre-Loup Rajot), and pursues him relentlessly. And again like the philosopher Martin, she ends up in hospital for, and with, her pains. Camille is the sort of woman of whom in real life you'd say 'Can't live with her, can live without her'. But up there on the screen she's rather endearing. </p> <p>Alexei Balabanov, whose gripping thriller Brother I praised last week, has returned to the elegant obscurity of his earlier Happy Days with <strong> Of Freaks and Men</strong> , a Gogolian fable set in turn-of-the-century St Petersburg. A sinister pornographer, Johann, specialises in photographs and films of flagellation, mostly involving young women being beaten across the buttocks by middle-aged female servants. These corrupt images he sells to middle-class clients, and manages through them to infiltrate and control two affluent households. The first is that of an elderly physician with a blind wife and adopted Siamese twins, whose singing talents Johann wants to exploit. The second is a railway tycoon whose daughter he covets. Shot in sepiatone and performed in a stylised, dream-like fashion, the picture exudes and exults in evil. </p> <p>The week's British film, Philip Haas's <strong> Up at the Villa</strong> , is a disappointing version of Somerset Maugham's 1940 pot-boiling novella (or should that be novelette?) which Christopher Isherwood adapted for an unmade movie in 1945 and pronounced to be 'a bad script from a bad story'. The haughty Kristin Scott Thomas plays a penniless English widow living in 1938 Florence. Courted by a rich British diplomat (James Fox), advised by a cynical American principessa (Anne Bancroft), propositioned by an American womaniser (Sean Penn), she becomes responsible for the death of a young Austrian refugee and blackmails a fascist policeman. The acting is stiffly parodic. The pace is funereal. The dialogue, some of it by Maugham, is stilted and worse - 'Regardless of what happens to you and I,' says Fox, disgracing the Eton tie he wears. The principal interest, for students of Maugham, is the double portrait of the novelist's bisexual lover, the charming scoundrel Gerald Haxton, in the characters of Scott Thomas's late husband and the amoral socialite played by Penn.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On Ash Wednesday 1982, I left England for Zimbabwe. I had flu, a temperature of 105 and hardly noticed the flight out. I was on my way to St Augustine's Mission, in the Eastern Highlands, near the border of Mozambique, a famous school where the children of government ministers mixed with peasants' sons. The principal, Father Prosser, hailed, like Trevor Huddleston, from the Community of the Resurrection in England and was well-liked, not least because he had helped freedom fighters (many of them former pupils of the school) during the war. I was going there to teach English. </p> <p>I had no idea what Zimbabwe was like. I must have had a sepia safari film playing in my imagination. I had to pinch myself to believe what I saw that first morning at St Augustine's: a cradle of blue-green hills, burnt orange earth, scarlet poinsettia bushes (that would shame potted Christmas presents forever). Our garden was a sort of hanging lunch - of voluptuous mangos, guavas and avocados (two kinds, green and purple).The schoolchildren greeted me as I walked along the path to the tall, red church and shook my hand warmly: 'Good morning, Miss Kellaway...' The sky, after a numb London February,was an unreal blue. I decided I must have died on the plane and woken in heaven. </p> <p>It was almost two years since independence and Mugabe was arguing that Zimbabweans, white and black, should put the war behind them and work to build a new country. He called this his 'policy of reconciliation'. It had a Christian ring that would make any mission school proud. And St Augustine's was proud. Mugabe was seen as a superb leader: articulate, honest and enlightened. But when I discussed his policy of reconciliation with other teachers (black and white), they predicted it would prove naive - white Rhodesians would never vote for Mugabe. I privately felt it remarkable that black Zimbabweans seemed so quick to forgive, so free of rancour or racial hatred. In the early Eighties, there was a tide of expatriates flowing in to 'help' the new Zimbabwe. Many of them were untrained teachers, like me. We were accepted with gratitude and enthusiasm. I found the welcome humbling; it was a luxury to be needed. </p> <p>My pupils at St Augustine's did not go on being as eerily polite as they were at the outset. I acquired the nickname Sssh Everybody, based on my weedy attempts to get the class to be quiet. It was a measure of the lack of any discipline problem that 'Ssh, everybody' worked. One of the boys I taught was called Nhamo which means trouble - he wasn't. Another was called Genius (he, like his friend Brilliant, was a dullard). But many of my pupils could easily have lived up to Brilliant or Clever (another popular name). I was scared by the ability of my A-level class. Even studying in a second language, most of them would have been more than a match for their English counterparts. </p> <p>The work itself was anomalous. I was alive to the neo-colonial oddity of teaching Milton's Comus , Jane Austen's Emma and Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge . But I will never forget how Tiyani Chitepo, a charismatic boy (son of the legendary Herbert Chitepo, who would have been Prime Minister if he hadn't been blown up by a bomb), got the hang of Comus in no time, writing a bold essay on the similarity between Comus and JR in Dallas . Of course, there were also students who could not cope at all. I remember a beautiful, industrious girl called Gloria writing, as if her first sentence were a sigh: ' Emma is a very, very long novel ...' </p> <p>In the evenings, I taught grown-ups, some of them old enough to be my grandparents, people who had never, in the old Rhodesia, been allowed to finish their education and who were returning to school in middle and old age to pick up from where they had left off. Nothing was more moving to me than the sight of these people hunched on tiny school chairs (the lessons, with an appropriate irony, took place in the primary school). They were so keen to learn. So optimistic. When one of my colleagues referred to this time as Zimbabwe's 'honeymoon period', I registered the phrase with dismay. Zimbabwe would surely not make the mistakes other African countries had made. It would be visionary. </p> <p>I knew that Zimbabwe was giving me more than I could ever offer it in return. And I understood the love that white Rhodesians felt for the land. I loved it, too. I wished I could stay forever. But I belonged in neither the black nor white communities. I was troubled by the attitude of most of the white Rhodesians I met. They seemed to speak in a collective language. When they disparaged black people, I was struck by how often they used exactly the same phrases, as though they had conferred. Perhaps that is how prejudice is. It often seemed that it was the more intrepid and liberal Rhodesians that had left the country; those who stayed on were as ready for a 'policy of reconciliation' as they were to be bitten by a snake. </p> <p>I fell in love with the country and then I fell in love with a Zimbabwean, also teaching at St Augustine's. When he got a job in Harare as a government auditor, I moved to the city with him. It was difficult to find anywhere to live together; any racism I had encountered in the Eastern Highlands was tame in comparison to what we faced from the white landlords of the suburban houses we hoped to rent. I learnt to speak rudimentary Shona, enough to know that 'kamba' means both tortoise and small house, and that there is only one word in Shona for good, beautiful, lovely, sweet, pretty, attractive. For six months, while we looked for somewhere else to live, we stayed with my boyfriend's extended family in a kamba in St Mary's township. </p> <p>St Mary's is the oldest of the Chitungwiza townships. It is 25 kilometres outside Harare and has been euphemistically renamed a 'high-density suburb'. It is a vast complex of tiny houses, with no electricity. The community alternated between energy and lassitude. It was always noisy (with a cock that crowed even at midnight). The women would cook, wash, pass babies from lap to lap and sweep outside their houses every morning as if to achieve that impossible thing - clean dirt. There was not much else to do. St Mary's was like a waiting-room. People were waiting for better times. </p> <p>The Shona language is not given to directness but people made no secret of their desire for an improved standard of living. They were exuberantly materialistic but with almost nothing to show for it. (When a neighbour bought a new car, a secondhand, rusty brute, a party was thrown to celebrate.) On Independence Day in 1983, I wrote home, describing a subdued mood. The crowd, I thought, seemed 'guarded, not certain whether to celebrate'. Euphoria was missing. I could guess why. Independence was the magic wand that didn't quite work, wielded by a dilatory magician. </p> <p>No one said they felt cheated or disappointed. My pupils always still talked about Mugabe and independence with expectant pride but in the township, lives had not changed enough - yet. The anticlimax could sometimes be seen on people's faces. The township was full of the unemployed: old men, listless teenagers. It was easy to understand what education promised - it was seen as a way out. At least independence meant education for all. New schools were opening everywhere. I taught at Zengeza High, a vast, red-brick place in the township with 'hot seating'. More than 2,000 children attended. It was like a brave factory that was not quite sure what it was turning out. For a disorganised term or two, I was head of its English department. There were some good teachers and some flamboyantly bad ones (one of the teachers in my charge was always drunk as a lord but it never stopped him from 'teaching'. I had to turf him out of class when I found him teaching in the wrong session). How could this uneven and unwieldy school begin to fulfil the hopes of its pupils? I used to look at the slogans many children had painted on their satchels - 'Education is the key to success' - and wonder. </p> <p>But even in 1983, black Zimbabweans were beginning to feel that some of Mugabe's Ministers were too greedy, that rich blacks were replacing whites. In a letter home from St Mary's, I wrote anxiously: 'There has been a quiet demonstration against those Ministers in Mugabe's government who are not practising the socialism they preach. The protesters argue that those Ministers who now own big farms should relinquish either their land or their government posts.' </p> <p>There was talk at that time of banning Zapu and becoming a one-party state. The letter ended with a sense of foreboding: 'I wonder whether there will ever be real racial harmony in this country. Prejudices go so deep. The layout and architecture of Harare make it hard to imagine integration. There are the sterile, white suburbs with their flowering trees and then 20km out the townships - a tumult of noise and people and wild trees and rocks.' </p> <p>I left Zimbabwe in 1986. In 1988, my boyfriend walked out on his job as a government auditor. He had been an idealistic Zanu supporter but was too disillusioned by government corruption to continue. He lives in England now. He tells me now that all Zimbabwe's problems over land redistribution should have been properly addressed 20 years ago. </p> <p>In Shona, when you ask someone how they are, they reply with a sentence which, literally translated, means: 'I am fine, if you are fine.' I used to find it delightful, amusingly evasive. In the not-so-new Zimbabwe, that evasion may not be funny any more.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Ash Wednesday 1982, I left England for Zimbabwe. I had flu, a temperature of 105 and hardly noticed the flight out. I was on my way to St Augustine's Mission, in the Eastern Highlands, near the border of Mozambique, a famous school where the children of government ministers mixed with peasants' sons. The principal, Father Prosser, hailed, like Trevor Huddleston, from the Community of the Resurrection in England and was well-liked, not least because he had helped freedom fighters (many of them former pupils of the school) during the war. I was going there to teach English. I had no idea what Zimbabwe was like. I must have had a sepia safari film playing in my imagination. I had to pinch myself to believe what I saw that first morning at St Augustine's: a cradle of blue-green hills, burnt orange earth, scarlet poinsettia bushes (that would shame potted Christmas presents forever). Our garden was a sort of hanging lunch - of voluptuous mangos, guavas and avocados (two kinds, green and purple).The schoolchildren greeted me as I walked along the path to the tall, red church and shook my hand warmly: 'Good morning, Miss Kellaway...' The sky, after a numb London February,was an unreal blue. I decided I must have died on the plane and woken in heaven. It was almost two years since independence and Mugabe was arguing that Zimbabweans, white and black, should put the war behind them and work to build a new country. He called this his 'policy of reconciliation'. It had a Christian ring that would make any mission school proud. And St Augustine's was proud. Mugabe was seen as a superb leader: articulate, honest and enlightened. But when I discussed his policy of reconciliation with other teachers (black and white), they predicted it would prove naive - white Rhodesians would never vote for Mugabe. I privately felt it remarkable that black Zimbabweans seemed so quick to forgive, so free of rancour or racial hatred. In the early Eighties, there was a tide of expatriates flowing in to 'help' the new Zimbabwe. Many of them were untrained teachers, like me. We were accepted with gratitude and enthusiasm. I found the welcome humbling; it was a luxury to be needed. My pupils at St Augustine's did not go on being as eerily polite as they were at the outset. I acquired the nickname Sssh Everybody, based on my weedy attempts to get the class to be quiet. It was a measure of the lack of any discipline problem that 'Ssh, everybody' worked. One of the boys I taught was called Nhamo which means trouble - he wasn't. Another was called Genius (he, like his friend Brilliant, was a dullard). But many of my pupils could easily have lived up to Brilliant or Clever (another popular name). I was scared by the ability of my A-level class. Even studying in a second language, most of them would have been more than a match for their English counterparts. The work itself was anomalous. I was alive to the neo-colonial oddity of teaching Milton's Comus , Jane Austen's Emma and Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge . But I will never forget how Tiyani Chitepo, a charismatic boy (son of the legendary Herbert Chitepo, who would have been Prime Minister if he hadn't been blown up by a bomb), got the hang of Comus in no time, writing a bold essay on the similarity between Comus and JR in Dallas . Of course, there were also students who could not cope at all. I remember a beautiful, industrious girl called Gloria writing, as if her first sentence were a sigh: ' Emma is a very, very long novel ...' In the evenings, I taught grown-ups, some of them old enough to be my grandparents, people who had never, in the old Rhodesia, been allowed to finish their education and who were returning to school in middle and old age to pick up from where they had left off. Nothing was more moving to me than the sight of these people hunched on tiny school chairs (the lessons, with an appropriate irony, took place in the primary school). They were so keen to learn. So optimistic. When one of my colleagues referred to this time as Zimbabwe's 'honeymoon period', I registered the phrase with dismay. Zimbabwe would surely not make the mistakes other African countries had made. It would be visionary. I knew that Zimbabwe was giving me more than I could ever offer it in return. And I understood the love that white Rhodesians felt for the land. I loved it, too. I wished I could stay forever. But I belonged in neither the black nor white communities. I was troubled by the attitude of most of the white Rhodesians I met. They seemed to speak in a collective language. When they disparaged black people, I was struck by how often they used exactly the same phrases, as though they had conferred. Perhaps that is how prejudice is. It often seemed that it was the more intrepid and liberal Rhodesians that had left the country; those who stayed on were as ready for a 'policy of reconciliation' as they were to be bitten by a snake. I fell in love with the country and then I fell in love with a Zimbabwean, also teaching at St Augustine's. When he got a job in Harare as a government auditor, I moved to the city with him. It was difficult to find anywhere to live together; any racism I had encountered in the Eastern Highlands was tame in comparison to what we faced from the white landlords of the suburban houses we hoped to rent. I learnt to speak rudimentary Shona, enough to know that 'kamba' means both tortoise and small house, and that there is only one word in Shona for good, beautiful, lovely, sweet, pretty, attractive. For six months, while we looked for somewhere else to live, we stayed with my boyfriend's extended family in a kamba in St Mary's township. St Mary's is the oldest of the Chitungwiza townships. It is 25 kilometres outside Harare and has been euphemistically renamed a 'high-density suburb'. It is a vast complex of tiny houses, with no electricity. The community alternated between energy and lassitude. It was always noisy (with a cock that crowed even at midnight). The women would cook, wash, pass babies from lap to lap and sweep outside their houses every morning as if to achieve that impossible thing - clean dirt. There was not much else to do. St Mary's was like a waiting-room. People were waiting for better times. The Shona language is not given to directness but people made no secret of their desire for an improved standard of living. They were exuberantly materialistic but with almost nothing to show for it. (When a neighbour bought a new car, a secondhand, rusty brute, a party was thrown to celebrate.) On Independence Day in 1983, I wrote home, describing a subdued mood. The crowd, I thought, seemed 'guarded, not certain whether to celebrate'. Euphoria was missing. I could guess why. Independence was the magic wand that didn't quite work, wielded by a dilatory magician. No one said they felt cheated or disappointed. My pupils always still talked about Mugabe and independence with expectant pride but in the township, lives had not changed enough - yet. The anticlimax could sometimes be seen on people's faces. The township was full of the unemployed: old men, listless teenagers. It was easy to understand what education promised - it was seen as a way out. At least independence meant education for all. New schools were opening everywhere. I taught at Zengeza High, a vast, red-brick place in the township with 'hot seating'. More than 2,000 children attended. It was like a brave factory that was not quite sure what it was turning out. For a disorganised term or two, I was head of its English department. There were some good teachers and some flamboyantly bad ones (one of the teachers in my charge was always drunk as a lord but it never stopped him from 'teaching'. I had to turf him out of class when I found him teaching in the wrong session). How could this uneven and unwieldy school begin to fulfil the hopes of its pupils? I used to look at the slogans many children had painted on their satchels - 'Education is the key to success' - and wonder. But even in 1983, black Zimbabweans were beginning to feel that some of Mugabe's Ministers were too greedy, that rich blacks were replacing whites. In a letter home from St Mary's, I wrote anxiously: 'There has been a quiet demonstration against those Ministers in Mugabe's government who are not practising the socialism they preach. The protesters argue that those Ministers who now own big farms should relinquish either their land or their government posts.' There was talk at that time of banning Zapu and becoming a one-party state. The letter ended with a sense of foreboding: 'I wonder whether there will ever be real racial harmony in this country. Prejudices go so deep. The layout and architecture of Harare make it hard to imagine integration. There are the sterile, white suburbs with their flowering trees and then 20km out the townships - a tumult of noise and people and wild trees and rocks.' I left Zimbabwe in 1986. In 1988, my boyfriend walked out on his job as a government auditor. He had been an idealistic Zanu supporter but was too disillusioned by government corruption to continue. He lives in England now. He tells me now that all Zimbabwe's problems over land redistribution should have been properly addressed 20 years ago. In Shona, when you ask someone how they are, they reply with a sentence which, literally translated, means: 'I am fine, if you are fine.' I used to find it delightful, amusingly evasive. In the not-so-new Zimbabwe, that evasion may not be funny any more.",

Sometimes, the two conjugate in marvellous hybrids - crocodile Romeos, frog philosophers, grasshopper statesmen, all tough carapace and mid-rhetorical gesture. Sometimes, man and beast unite; the artist seduces his lover on a beach - the paint is literally mixed with sand - framed by a halo of ecstatic crabs.

His etchings have been compared with Goya and Ensor and his watercolours elaborate a whole series of invented hieroglyphs and signs as delicate and toylike as anything by Klee. </p> <p>To see his work en masse at the Whitechapel is to drift through a terracotta landscape in which insects vibrate in the hot, bright air and animals move with sultry languor. But it's also to see an artist trying on a hundred different styles, amazingly fecund, salty yet suave - Mexico's answer to Picasso. </p> <p>Not since Old Cojones departed the Earth himself has any artist been quite so priapic. There isn't a fish, snake or monkey in this show that doesn't wear its manhood proudly. Some critters are just uselessly concu piscent - the cobalt lizard, you feel, is too vain to get a date - while others bask in erotic hedonism. The cocky rabbit, cousin to Warner's roadrunner, has outwitted so many coyotes that he is depicted as a double-pronged king among animals. Toledo even sculpts himself in scarlet clay, lying on his back, trousers unbuttoned to the warming sun. This is not the fly-fumbling randiness of late Picasso, but an innocent relish for earthly pleasures. </p> <p>Toledo loves to spin yarns - cocky rabbit is upgraded Aesop. There's also something of Kafka in his half-human insects, trapped in their reticulated bodies, and a good deal of Borgesian wit to his mythical creatures. But the stories are very often his own memories of childhood. His mother's warnings against the perils of the sewing machine generate a spectacular painting of a cat bristling beneath the whirring instrument, an electric storm of claws and needles. Best of all is his homage to the bicycle, in which the freedom machine speeds off riderless through the heat, trailing a cloud of dust behind it. </p> <p>Toledo uses all sorts of material to get that onomatopoeic effect: salt, dust, chalky pigments that imitate the grainy, desiccated surface of the land. He still works on the floor, using oil-coated boards, and some of his images are exactly what they seem to be - drawings in sand. There's a transformatory touch to everything he does, conjuring tattered birds out of rubbed and abraided papyrus, embed ding a few pistachio shells in baked clay to get a planar view of Oaxaca. I doubt anybody has ever evoked the delirious hum of insects better; five pencils, tied together and zig-zagged in a skittering dance across a scrap of paper. </p> <p>But you can have too much of the great outdoors; one more flash rabbit or braying donkey would probably have tipped the balance. By far the most enthralling works in this show are the self-portraits in the last gallery, a suite of etchings, lithos and sketches in which the artist sends himself up. </p> <p>Toledo the hero, the art star, the titanic lover - all are reduced to foolish fables. What you see is a browbeaten man, often depicted alongside an animal in a Mexican stand-off. The comparison with Goya is there in the mordant self-scrutiny. But Toledo even has a go at introspection. There he is, head in hand, slumped at a table. Behind him, a giant toad parodies this soulful posture, one paw clutched to its mocking breast.</p>",

To be reminded of Kubrick's classic SF movie before seeing Brian De Palma's first essay in the genre was as dangerous as it would be to have someone sing a Verdi aria before the curtain goes up on the Elton John-Tim Rice version of A\u00efda . </p> <p>De Palma's movie comes at an odd time, a year before the setting of 2001: A Space Odyssey and two years before the centenary of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 1902 milestone, A Trip to the Moon . For a century, the cinema has reflected the mood on Earth through our attitudes of fear, wonder and anticipation attendant upon the exploration of space. Fritz Lang's 1929 Woman in the Moon invented the countdown while Werner von Braun was still a schoolboy; Alexander Korda's 1935 masterpiece Things to Come saw a journey to the stars as the salvation of a troubled world; postwar SF flicks such as The Day the Earth Stood Still reflected Cold War tensions. </p> <p>When space fiction started to become space fact in the late Fifties, the ground had been laid for Kubrick's landmark combination of mechanics and mysticism from which all subsequent space films stem. </p> <p>In 1983, The Right Stuff treated the US space enterprise in a historical fashion, looking back to the origins of supersonic flight and the beginning of the Mercury programme in the early Sixties. This has recently been followed up by Apollo 13 which recalled how, as early as 1970, it took a near-fatal accident to capture the attention of jaded viewers. </p> <p>While his friends and fellow movie brats Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were making Close Encounters and Star Wars , De Palma was directing thrillers that paid homage to Hitchcock, and over the years he's brought his kinetic flair and his taste to a variety of genres, rarely attempting to break new ground. </p> <p>Now in his sixtieth year, with a grandiose screen version of the old TV series Mission: Impossible behind him, De Palma has got around to SF with a second mission movie boldly going where others have gone before. </p> <p>The year is 2020 and a joint Russian-American expedition to Mars is being led by black astronaut, Luke Graham (Don Cheadle), presumably named by his parents in honour of the sky walking movie hero. Things go awry when they meet a strange Martian force that sucks the Russians into a lethal vortex, sparing only Luke. He'd been reading Treasure Island with his son before blasting off and had wondered how 'that old Ben Gunn' got marooned. </p> <p>Now he knows and a quartet of colleagues set out from a space station to his rescue. They're the husband-and-wife team, Woody (Tim Robbins) and Terri (Connie Nielsen); the recently widowed systems designer, Jim (Gary Sinise); and the young engineer, Phil (Jerry 0'Connell). Time on board goes slowly and Woody and Terri dance upside down to pass the hours while Jim looks at home movies of his late wife, a fellow astronaut with whom he'd planned to explore Mars. To paraphrase the advertising slogan for Alien , in space nobody can hear you cry. </p> <p>Not everyone makes it there and back, and in trying to land, the rescuers undergo a crisis that makes the Apollo 13 affair look like trouble with the dashboard lighter. They finish up stranded on the red planet equipped with some simple escape aids and some clunky B-movie dialogue.

      "bodyText": "Mission to Mars (116 mins, PG) Directed by Brian De Palma; starring Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle It was a mistake to play Strauss's Blue Danube waltz at the Odeon, Leicester Square the other morning before the lights went down for Mission to Mars . To be reminded of Kubrick's classic SF movie before seeing Brian De Palma's first essay in the genre was as dangerous as it would be to have someone sing a Verdi aria before the curtain goes up on the Elton John-Tim Rice version of A\u00efda . De Palma's movie comes at an odd time, a year before the setting of 2001: A Space Odyssey and two years before the centenary of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 1902 milestone, A Trip to the Moon . For a century, the cinema has reflected the mood on Earth through our attitudes of fear, wonder and anticipation attendant upon the exploration of space. Fritz Lang's 1929 Woman in the Moon invented the countdown while Werner von Braun was still a schoolboy; Alexander Korda's 1935 masterpiece Things to Come saw a journey to the stars as the salvation of a troubled world; postwar SF flicks such as The Day the Earth Stood Still reflected Cold War tensions. When space fiction started to become space fact in the late Fifties, the ground had been laid for Kubrick's landmark combination of mechanics and mysticism from which all subsequent space films stem. In 1983, The Right Stuff treated the US space enterprise in a historical fashion, looking back to the origins of supersonic flight and the beginning of the Mercury programme in the early Sixties. This has recently been followed up by Apollo 13 which recalled how, as early as 1970, it took a near-fatal accident to capture the attention of jaded viewers. While his friends and fellow movie brats Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were making Close Encounters and Star Wars , De Palma was directing thrillers that paid homage to Hitchcock, and over the years he's brought his kinetic flair and his taste to a variety of genres, rarely attempting to break new ground. Now in his sixtieth year, with a grandiose screen version of the old TV series Mission: Impossible behind him, De Palma has got around to SF with a second mission movie boldly going where others have gone before. The year is 2020 and a joint Russian-American expedition to Mars is being led by black astronaut, Luke Graham (Don Cheadle), presumably named by his parents in honour of the sky walking movie hero. Things go awry when they meet a strange Martian force that sucks the Russians into a lethal vortex, sparing only Luke. He'd been reading Treasure Island with his son before blasting off and had wondered how 'that old Ben Gunn' got marooned. Now he knows and a quartet of colleagues set out from a space station to his rescue. They're the husband-and-wife team, Woody (Tim Robbins) and Terri (Connie Nielsen); the recently widowed systems designer, Jim (Gary Sinise); and the young engineer, Phil (Jerry 0'Connell). Time on board goes slowly and Woody and Terri dance upside down to pass the hours while Jim looks at home movies of his late wife, a fellow astronaut with whom he'd planned to explore Mars. To paraphrase the advertising slogan for Alien , in space nobody can hear you cry. Not everyone makes it there and back, and in trying to land, the rescuers undergo a crisis that makes the Apollo 13 affair look like trouble with the dashboard lighter. They finish up stranded on the red planet equipped with some simple escape aids and some clunky B-movie dialogue. 'I don't see how a quake six months ago could have caused such distortion,' someone remarks. 'That was no quake,' someone replies just a split second after the whole audience has delivered the line in unison. Interpreting a series of test messages \u00e0 la 2001 leads to a close encounter with a higher intelligence. Entering into an all-white palace, the starry-eyed astronauts are entertained by a three-dimensional planetarium display that provides them with a history of the universe. They meet a tall, thin, androgynous extraterrestrial dressed in gold lam\u00e9, which may be the standard Martian uniform, though perhaps this exotic creature is on the way to the Oscars. One way or the other, this scene epitomises the total absence of invention and imagination. There is the possibility that a final sequence has been cut in which it's revealed that the movie is a Tarkovskian hallucination experienced by an early astronaut who's spent his retirement watching SF movies. This idea is not entirely my own, as it forms the background to Galaxy Quest , an hilarious SF comedy which opens in a fortnight's time and is a treat in store.",

From their high point in the years just after the First World War, the big stores have been in more or less continuous retreat ever since. The recent rediscovery of the glamour of the department store is as much as anything to do with the tedium of buying everything from books to groceries on the screen. If there is any point in having shops at all, it is to recreate the theatrical qualities that made the department store what it was in the first place, and if you are going to have it in any kind of building, it had better be an impressive one. </p> <p>Vittorio Radice, the irrepressible boss of Selfridges, has plenty of old-fashioned showmanship. Instead of putting up scaffolding while the London store is being refurbished, he has opted to wrap the exterior in a giant photograph by artist Sam Taylor Wood, which he calls the largest work of art in the world. It's the kind of stunt that New York's Macy's, who in the nineteenth century would clear out a whole floor for an indoor golf tournament, would recognise. Radice is also aware of the importance of distinctive architecture in helping a department store survive in the present climate. He has got Norman Foster remodelling the back of the London store, and in Birmingham he has commissioned Future Systems to design a new windowless store. </p> <p>It's an important project for Selfridges and, with a budget of \u00a340 million, an important one for Future Systems. Jan Kaplicky is an architect who has spent most of his career thinking big and building small. He has dreamt about skyscrapers and museums, but has had to invest most of his energies into designing wine coolers for the Ivy and the interiors of chic florists shops. </p> <p>However, last year's unveiling of his spectacular media centre at Lord's won him recognition and prizes. Until recently Future Systems consisted of Kaplicky, his partner, Amanda Levete and a lot of hope. Kaplicky came to London from Prague in 1968, and a lot of his thinking is shaped by those years spent on the wrong side of the iron curtain. Now, after two decades labouring away at the outer edges of architectural practice, Future Systems has made it into the mainstream. </p> <p>The commission for Selfridges in Birmingham fulfils the promise Future Systems has shown for so long. Their plans are the result of the rebuilding of the Bullring, the most unloved shopping development of all from the Sixties. It is one of a pair of big department stores that will act as anchors at either end of a new covered mall. But what makes it stand out from the Esperanto architecture of the conventional mall is the quality of the Selfridges design which has an architectural presence both inside, and outside the mall. It has to address the precinct of St Martin's church, the major roads that Birmingham is still trying to tame, and the mall itself. </p> <p>One solution to these very different tasks would have been architectural schizophrenia: contextualism to create a suitable setting for the gothic church on one side, high-tech exhibitionism to make a landmark to be seen by passing motorists on the other, and the stage-set approach of the typical shopping mall inside, to tempt in the customers. It was not a strategy that appealed to Kaplicky, who believes in consistency, and logic. Instead he has designed a free-form shape that deals with all three aspects of the store with one voice. It is a gentle curving structure that winds in and out of the mall, to and from the street edge. </p> <p>It defers to the church, it allows for entrances at a number of different levels, and it also deals with the prohibition that conventional retailing wisdom puts on windows. There is a garden and a restaurant on the roof, and two atria inside. On the outside the skin is pierced by a couple of glass bubbles that provide a showcase for passers-by. </p> <p>The store will look as apparently alien to architectural tradition as one of Kaplicky's beloved spaceships. But in fact it represents something of a softening of Future Systems's pursuit of innovation. The inspiration here is not the celebration of ultra-high technology. The store is influenced by much more organic forms, and , it has to be said, some of Kaplicky's dreams from the Sixties. This will not be a titanium-skinned hull; instead the proposed cladding is made from a pretty low-tech material - circular china plates. And it is a frankly decorative skin. </p> <p>In hiring Future Systems Radice is going back to the store's roots. In 1908, Gordon Selfridge brought the great Chicago architect Daniel Burnham to Britain to design a department store for him, the like of which London had not seen before.

      "body": "<p>Long before I met Jane, I was in the Sugarcubes. We were purists and thought the media was the devil, that they were the ones who killed Elvis and all that. We were really anti-press. Also, I'd lived in Iceland all my life; I was violently shy. So it was only when I moved to London in 1993 that I said to myself: 'You're a coward; do 5,000 interviews a day.' I jumped off a cliff into the media. </p> <p>When I met Jane I had been doing interviews for about 12-14 hours every day for three months. That much exposure was like an interesting chemistry experiment. At the time, I was really into it and found it exciting, but I took it simply as an experience. To meet Jane at that point was really refreshing. She was so no-nonsense and knew exactly what she was doing. There were no show-offy tricks or fake ways to get to know me. </p> <p>Sometimes, when you meet these strangers, and they're all foreigners, the idea of trying to be close and personal with someone in three seconds is really hard to deal with. Jane was different. Jane's really matter of-fact about things. I think she's definitely born with a talent. She knows. She can look at a person and she knows instinctively, straight away, who they are. She picks up more on the human side of people. A lot of photographers concentrated on the comical aspect of me and got me to do animated things - to be sort of an eskimo, puffin-eating, crazy elf. But Jane was definitely not up for that. She just takes people as they are. She picks up the down-to-earth-nature in people in about five seconds. She will just ignore everything else, and ask you to sit down. She's also very calm - that's important. If the other person is neurotic then it's not a lot of fun. </p> <p>When we first met, I didn't know anything about her. I was meeting all the famous people ever and I didn't have a clue who they were. I remembered Jane more than the picture she took. There was a feeling that she didn't want to make anything out of me, was just taking me as I was, for who I am. It's very honest. It's not the strongest of descriptive words to use, but it's simply what it is. Honest. Her simplicity is the key, so to kind of throw too many words in there to try and describe it just confuses it. Although I don't know anything about her life, I can imagine her picking up that kind of honesty, say, 10 times a day. It's a consistency she has - a mood she brings. You get very grateful to be photographed by someone like that. </p> <p>The second time she photographed me was when I interviewed David Attenborough. I was a little nervous because I'd never met David before and he's my absolute hero. She was asking us to embrace each other, which made me very shy. But she was the same as the first time we met. She's just bulletproof. </p> <p>Jane's pictures will become part of a book about my career that I'm working on at the moment. My record company has spent five years convincing me it was the thing to do. I thought it was too self-indulgent to put a book out about yourself. But it's not really about me, it's about the people who've given me a chance to say what I want to say. There's a section where I've asked some of the people I've worked with the most to contribute something that comes from them - it doesn't have to be anything to do with me. When I work with a designer or a photographer, a video director, a musician, a producer or an engineer, for me it's all the same interaction. It's about getting to know the person and then trying to find mutual ground. Where is the place we are both at home? In most cases, I've just been an umbrella. You see all my records and it just says Bj\u00f6rk Bj\u00f6rk Bj\u00f6rk all over it, but at the end of the day, it's always a collaboration. </p> <p>Jane is one of several photographers - including Jurgen Teller, Nick Knight and Araki - in the book that I've chosen because they are quite truthful. People say photographers are documenting humans. It's either complete fantasy - the creative, theatrical, fantasy world - or there's the other extreme: face value. The covers of my albums are the fantasy element - they're not the way I look every day but have an element of truth to them. Jane's work is the opposite - the stark reality. Truth lies in one or other extreme. </p> <p>I don't know when we'll next meet. I'm lucky, I'm my own boss. Most people in my job have 5,000 people in skyscrapers making plans, but I can do whatever I want. It's always one day at a time round my house. Jane's putting a picture of me on the front of her new book. I'm just really honoured. </p> <p>\u0095 Eye to Eye, an exhibition of photography by Jane Bown, runs from 23 April to 28 May at the Foundation Gallery, Gate 13, Lamb Street, Spitalfields Market, London E1.

Awesome. We've got people out day and night, tracking down Dobson supporters to win over. But we can't find any. They're all supporting our man. Life-long Tories too. We got retired brigadiers in Richmond canvassing for Ken. Even Jeffrey Archer's lady friends in Shepherd's Market are slipping us some readies.</p> <p>DOUG: But why is he so popular? I mean the GLC was a disaster, wasn't it? Banning black binliners 'cos they were racist? I mean I ask you. Lesbian resource centres on every high street? Buggery on the rates? Forcing old ladies to spend their days on the Tube?</p> <p>THICK BOY: Fair question, Doug. But ask yourself - if it was such a disaster, why did Thatcher abolish it?</p> <p>DOUG: 'Cos she'd gone mad by then, that's why.</p> <p>THICK BOY: You see, Tony Blair's trouble all along - why a red mist appears in front of his eyes every time Ken's name comes up - is that he believes the bollocks Murdoch feeds him.</p> <p>DOUG: It's a personality defect. He likes rich men.</p> <p>THICK BOY: He just doesn't realise, people liked the GLC. They don't know what it did half the time but they loved it. Fare's Fair, remember that? 10p to go where you like, firework displays every other weekend and, and, well, that was about it really. It was just great.</p> <p><b> Doug leans in. </b></p> <p>DOUG: <b> (Quietly)</b> Two hundred thousand.</p> <p>THICK BOY: Sorry?</p> <p>DOUG: My contribution.

We were on the verge of getting Damien Hirst to embalm a baby dolphin for us. Two hundred, that's brilliant.</p> <p>DOUG: I can afford it. But listen, Thick Lad _</p> <p>THICK BOY: Boy. Yeah?</p> <p>DOUG: This is between you, me and Ken. Nobody - and I mean nobody - must know where this money comes from.</p> <p>THICK BOY: Gotcha.

      "bodyText": "Snogging Ken is a one-act 'entertainment' about a sinister New Labour plot to smear Ken Livingstone, which opens at London's Almeida theatre this week. The authors Tariq Ali: An author, film-maker, playwright and broadcaster who was involved in setting up Channel 4. His most recent television production was Fay Weldon's Big Women. Howard Brenton: A playwright whose works include Romans in Britain and Pravda, co-authored with David Hare. He has co-written five plays with Tariq Ali, including Iranian Nights and Moscow Gold. Andy De La Tour: A playwright and actor whose most recent appearance was in Harold Pinter's Celebration at the Almeida. He has collaborated with Brenton and Ali once before on Landslide. Dramatis Personae Pandora Manfidi: A Millbank Babe in her late twenties. Lola Jones: A Labour MP in her mid-twenties. Thick-boy Geezer: A rock star and Ken-supporter. Douglas Hall: A former Cabinet Minister. A young woman, PANDORA, sits at Table One. At Table Two sits a young man, THICK BOY GEEZER. They're both waiting. LOLA comes in, flustered, and sits at Pandora's table. Lights fade on Table Two. Table One LOLA: I'm so sorry, I'm so dreadfully sorry. PANDORA: Sweetheart, sit down. Water? LOLA: Something a little stronger? PANDORA: I think not. Not today. Pandora pours her a glass of mineral water. PANDORA: How do you feel? LOLA: Terrible. PANDORA: You mustn't blame yourself. LOLA: I wasn't prepared. I thought I was but I wasn't. I feel so guilty. PANDORA: How many times did he do it to you exactly? LOLA: Ten, twelve, I don't know. I tried to stop him. I wanted to shout out in protest but I couldn't. My throat had dried up. He just kept on coming at me. From all angles. How could he have abused me like that? PANDORA: Don't torment yourself, Lola. Newsnight . Every politician loathes Jeremy Paxman. LOLA: I feel so ashamed. I was Paxmanned! PANDORA: Listen, sweetheart. To be Paxmanned is a baptism of fire, think of it as a slither up the learning curve. LOLA: But look at Michael Howard, he was finished after his Paxman. PANDORA: No he survived the interview. It was Ann Widdecombe who fisted him. Pandora takes delicate sip of water. LOLA: So no more interviews for me. I quite understand, I had my chance and I blew it . PANDORA: No, no, not at all. Quite the opposite. You're a celebrity now. Everyone wants to interview you. John Humphrys, James Naughtie, even Trevor MacDonald thinks he can come up with a question. LOLA: Oh good. I'll do better next time I promise. PANDORA: We know you will. We're counting on you, Lola. You've put all frivolous personal pursuits aside for the sake of your leader. LOLA: I won't let you down. PANDORA: It's a fiasco. The whole campaign. How do we turn it round? How do we transform Frank Dobson into the winning candidate? LOLA: What do the focus groups say? PANDORA: We dissolved them. They all wanted to vote for Ken. LOLA: I can believe it! D'you know, I haven't met one single person who's going to vote for Frank. PANDORA: Or for Shagger Norris. Not to mention the Libdem thingy. LOLA: But it's no fault of Millbank's that Ken's riding so high in the polls. He's more popular than Tony! PANDORA: (Tetchy) Yes, yes, all right Lola. The problem is Frank. He just keeps fucking up. I told him to be cool on Question Time . Play it strong and silent, I said. And what does the fat arsehole go and say? \"Make my Day\". Dobbo the Donkey as Clint Eastwood? I think not. LOLA: (Shocked) Do you talk about all us MPs like that at Millbank? PANDORA: Only incontinent dinosaurs like Dobboplodicus that refuse to make themselves extinct. Not you, sweetheart, you're our new breed, barely hatched. A little wobbly on the claws - like last night - but you'll soon be flying high. LOLA: But how can I help? PANDORA: The strategic gameplan is 'New Labour, New Electorate'. LOLA: (Alarmed) You mean cancel the election? Abolish the electorate? Not let people vote? PANDORA: No, Lola, I was being _ LOLA: Hyperbolic? PANDORA: Conceptual. Hearts and minds. The key to a new electorate. We can't persuade them to vote for Dobbo the Donkey. But we can persuade them not to vote for Ken. Even at this eleventh hour. LOLA: But we can't persuade them. Frank's still on 16 per cent! PANDORA: We can poison them. LOLA: What? PANDORA: Poison their minds. LOLA: How? PANDORA: You, sweet babe, are the cyanide pill of democracy. LOLA: I am? Lights down on Table One. Lights up Table Two. DOUG WATSON arrives, late. He looks round. THICK BOY looks up . Table Two DOUG: Is this the right table? THICK BOY: It certainly is, Dougie. Have a pew. Doug sits. He looks round. DOUG: (Quietly) Is Ken on his way? THICK BOY: Don't worry about a thing. DOUG: Running late? Not surprised, he's a busy man. THICK BOY: Listen, Dougie... DOUG: Doug. THICK BOY: Doug. Ken's not coming. DOUG: I asked to see Ken personally. If he's doing so well he doesn't need my help, fine, forget it . Doug starts to rise but Thick Boy stops him. THICK BOY: No, no, don't get the wrong end of the stick. Ken is extremely pleased you've contacted us. He values your support immensely but he can't be seen breaking bread with you. In public. Not yet anyway. DOUG: OK, well... THICK BOY: I'm here as Ken's emissary. For the purposes of this lunch, I am his eyes and his ears. DOUG: You mean his bagman. (They laugh) But who are you exactly? Thick Boy looks in surprise. THICK BOY: Don't you know? Look closely, chuck. DOUG: (Looks) No, sorry. Should I? THICK BOY: Thick Boy Geezer. DOUG: Come again. THICK BOY: Thick Boy Geezer. Me. The Brit awards? The Jug of Water incident? DOUG: Yes of course! You're all over my daughter's bedroom. THICK BOY: Been over so many, pal. DOUG: Well, very pleased to meet you, Mr Geezer. THICK BOY: Call me Thick Boy. DOUG: Thick Boy. Has a certain ring. I'm sorry I'm late anyway. Northern Line, tsch. THICK BOY: Ken'll soon sort that out, don't you worry. DOUG: Actually it was 'Customer Action'. That's what they call it. Some poor fucker threw himself in front of a Tube. THICK BOY: Tragic. Probably one of Frank Dobson's people, read the latest polls. DOUG: I don't suppose you use the Tube much, of course. THICK BOY: No, I'm a man of the people. I even use a bus. I'm not proud. I'm starving, let's get a menu. DOUG: No. Thick Boy. Business first. THICK BOY: Fair enough. DOUG: How's the campaign looking? THICK BOY: Frightening. Awesome. We've got people out day and night, tracking down Dobson supporters to win over. But we can't find any. They're all supporting our man. Life-long Tories too. We got retired brigadiers in Richmond canvassing for Ken. Even Jeffrey Archer's lady friends in Shepherd's Market are slipping us some readies. DOUG: But why is he so popular? I mean the GLC was a disaster, wasn't it? Banning black binliners 'cos they were racist? I mean I ask you. Lesbian resource centres on every high street? Buggery on the rates? Forcing old ladies to spend their days on the Tube? THICK BOY: Fair question, Doug. But ask yourself - if it was such a disaster, why did Thatcher abolish it? DOUG: 'Cos she'd gone mad by then, that's why. THICK BOY: You see, Tony Blair's trouble all along - why a red mist appears in front of his eyes every time Ken's name comes up - is that he believes the bollocks Murdoch feeds him. DOUG: It's a personality defect. He likes rich men. THICK BOY: He just doesn't realise, people liked the GLC. They don't know what it did half the time but they loved it. Fare's Fair, remember that? 10p to go where you like, firework displays every other weekend and, and, well, that was about it really. It was just great. Doug leans in. DOUG: (Quietly) Two hundred thousand. THICK BOY: Sorry? DOUG: My contribution. To Ken's campaign. THICK BOY: Two hundred k?? DOUG: Ssssh! THICK BOY: Fantastic. The coffers are almost empty. We were on the verge of getting Damien Hirst to embalm a baby dolphin for us. Two hundred, that's brilliant. DOUG: I can afford it. But listen, Thick Lad _ THICK BOY: Boy. Yeah? DOUG: This is between you, me and Ken. Nobody - and I mean nobody - must know where this money comes from. THICK BOY: Gotcha. It's great to have you on board, Doug. DOUG: I just want to see Tony Blair's eyeballs burst on London election night. THICK BOY: Bugger me. You must really hate him. DOUG: I gave him everything. My business experience, my reputation, even my house at Cape Cod. What does he do? Sacks me from the Cabinet. Has me trashed in public. THICK BOY: Oh I see. That's why you're here, is it? Revenge. Doug takes out a cheque and puts it on the table. Thick Boy picks it up and grins. Suddenly his grin disappears . THICK BOY: Er, you forgot to sign it. DOUG: I did, didn't I? Doug smiles enigmatically. Table One PANDORA: So you see, Lola, we want you to poison the well of Livingstone's popularity. LOLA: The cyanide pill? Me? How exciting! PANDORA: You are uniquely placed, Lola, to provide a service to the party for which your reward will be something beyond your wildest dreams. And I don't mean taking it up the arse from Alastair Campbell. LOLA: What if I fail? PANDORA: Failure's not factored into the Project. LOLA: What do I have to do? PANDORA: Tell the truth. LOLA: About what? PANDORA: About you and Ken. LOLA: I've never met him outside the Commons. PANDORA: You met him when you were 15, Lola. LOLA: Did I? PANDORA: Oh yes. You went to interview him for your school magazine. LOLA: What? We never had a school magazine. PANDORA: Oh you did. LOLA: You must be muddling me up with someone else. PANDORA: We don't think so. We think you're our girl. LOLA: Oh I see. It's not true, I see! Oh great. You want me to say I interviewed him when I was 15 and _ and he said something horrid! Brilliant! What? He said _ I know! Up the IRA! PANDORA: Not bad, Lola. Only he's still saying Up the IRA and nobody turns a hair. No, we want you to say... LOLA: I know what he said! Legalise cannabis! PANDORA: Half the Cabinet smokes grass when Tony's not looking. LOLA: (Thinks) I know, he said he was plotting to take over the party! PANDORA: He actually did say that. His turn after Kinnock, remember? LOLA: So what was he supposed to have said to me then? PANDORA: He said he wanted to shag you. LOLA: Oh my God. He said he wanted to shag me? Pandora, please. I can't go on Breakfast with Frost and say that Ken Livingstone wanted to have sex with a 15-year-old girl. PANDORA: More than wanted to, sweetie. (Looks) Did. LOLA: What?? PANDORA: And you were that 15-year-old. LOLA: Me?? I can't do that. I'm a married woman, what will Nigel say? PANDORA: You weren't married to Nigel when you were 15, what's the problem? LOLA: I can't. I'm sorry. I won't. PANDORA: For the good of the party. For Tony. LOLA: That's obscene. PANDORA: You're saying 'no'? LOLA: I'm saying 'no'. Pandora looks at her with a smile. PANDORA: Fine. Pandora starts to put her things away. Lola is very agitated. LOLA: Can't I just say he held my hand? Pandora gets up to go. LOLA: Okay, he kissed me! On the lips! Is that enough? Pandora starts to go. LOLA: He snogged me!! It's all coming back! Snogging Ken! It was great!! Pandora has almost left. LOLA: Okay - I shagged him! Pandora stops. She smiles. Table Two DOUG: Homosexuals. THICK BOY: Come again. DOUG: Reassure me here, Thick Boy. I mean take it as read, I've got nothing against them... THICK BOY: Course not. DOUG: But is Ken going to make it compulsory? THICK BOY: Compulsory? Oh I get it. Gay marriages, that's what you're worried about. DOUG: What's he want to do? Marry gay couples himself? Stand there with a chain of office round his neck in some kind of pink dressing gown? THICK BOY: No, no, it's about gay rights. Pensions, that sort of stuff. If one half of a gay couple cops it, the other half gets the pension. DOUG: Oh I see. No harm in that I suppose. THICK BOY: Happy? Thick Boy pushes the cheque towards Doug for signing but Doug doesn't move. Thick Boy fidgets with the cheque THICK BOY: I'm getting a bit peckish here, Doug. DOUG: I have to mention... the 's' word. THICK BOY: Sex? Why, what have you heard? DOUG: Nothing. Should I have? THICK BOY: If there's one thing Millbank can't get him on, it's sex.

Table One PANDORA: Socialism. LOLA: (Scared) What? PANDORA: You're a socialist, aren't you, Lola? LOLA: Am I? PANDORA: What you've agreed to do. It's for the good of the cause. LOLA: I...

      "body": "<p>These two sides are beginning to resemble leaders approaching the finishing line in the London Marathon. </p> <p>While Gillingham still appear to have plenty in the tank and are winding themselves up for a sprint finish, Wigan resemble a team who can't wait for the tape after burning up too much energy early on. Having fallen behind due to their FA Cup run, Gillingham are making effective use of their spare matches over their promotion chasing rivals. </p> <p>This win leaves them six points behind second placed Wigan with two matches in hand. And with games to come against Burnley and Millwall, two of the sides above them, manager Peter Taylor's optimism that 'second spot is up for grabs' appears well justified. </p> <p>Gillingham fans must hope their side can avoid the lottery of a play-off following their defeat on penalties to Manchester City at Wembley last year. </p> <p>Wigan, on the other hand, appear to have hit the wall. Having gone unbeaten in the League until January they have now won only five of their last 16 and, have not lost away from home for 11 months until last Tuesday, they have now been beaten on their travels twice in five days. </p> <p>They must hope they discover a second wind soon if they are to hang on to their automatic promotion place. John Benson, Wigan's manager, laid the fault squarely at the door of his highly rated Northern Ireland goalkeeper, Roy Carroll, blaming him for both goals. </p> <p>'He's done magnificently well for us in a lot of games but he has to take responsibility for today,' he said. </p> <p>Taylor was more understanding about his keeper, Vince Bartram's failure to even make the kick-off after being held up in a traffic jam on the M25. It forced Gillingham to re-jig their team just a few minutes before the start and gave the Australian Steve Mauton his first opportunity. 'These things happen sometimes,' Taylor said. </p> <p>Carroll's first mistake came in the 17th minute. Iffy Onuora's forceful run opened up the Wigan defence and he swapped passes with Nicky Southall. His shot from 15 yards lacked real power but still squeezed through Carroll's fingers on the sodden turf. </p> <p>The crowd allowed for the first time in Gillingham's new main stand, rising impressively into the Kent skyline offering further evidence of the club's remarkable turn- around in fortunes since Paul Scally arrived as chairman five years ago, rose in delight. </p> <p>It took less than 90 seconds for their mood to match the colour of the black sky.

      "bodyText": "These two sides are beginning to resemble leaders approaching the finishing line in the London Marathon. While Gillingham still appear to have plenty in the tank and are winding themselves up for a sprint finish, Wigan resemble a team who can't wait for the tape after burning up too much energy early on. Having fallen behind due to their FA Cup run, Gillingham are making effective use of their spare matches over their promotion chasing rivals. This win leaves them six points behind second placed Wigan with two matches in hand. And with games to come against Burnley and Millwall, two of the sides above them, manager Peter Taylor's optimism that 'second spot is up for grabs' appears well justified. Gillingham fans must hope their side can avoid the lottery of a play-off following their defeat on penalties to Manchester City at Wembley last year. Wigan, on the other hand, appear to have hit the wall. Having gone unbeaten in the League until January they have now won only five of their last 16 and, have not lost away from home for 11 months until last Tuesday, they have now been beaten on their travels twice in five days. They must hope they discover a second wind soon if they are to hang on to their automatic promotion place. John Benson, Wigan's manager, laid the fault squarely at the door of his highly rated Northern Ireland goalkeeper, Roy Carroll, blaming him for both goals. 'He's done magnificently well for us in a lot of games but he has to take responsibility for today,' he said. Taylor was more understanding about his keeper, Vince Bartram's failure to even make the kick-off after being held up in a traffic jam on the M25. It forced Gillingham to re-jig their team just a few minutes before the start and gave the Australian Steve Mauton his first opportunity. 'These things happen sometimes,' Taylor said. Carroll's first mistake came in the 17th minute. Iffy Onuora's forceful run opened up the Wigan defence and he swapped passes with Nicky Southall. His shot from 15 yards lacked real power but still squeezed through Carroll's fingers on the sodden turf. The crowd allowed for the first time in Gillingham's new main stand, rising impressively into the Kent skyline offering further evidence of the club's remarkable turn- around in fortunes since Paul Scally arrived as chairman five years ago, rose in delight. It took less than 90 seconds for their mood to match the colour of the black sky. Michael Clegg's cross was hit more in hope than in anticipation and was going nowhere until Adrian Pennock swung a boot at it. It looped high into the air and over his keeper into his own net. It is a certainty for one of those blooper football videos that come out at Christmas. Gillingham had Wigan penned back in their own half for most of the second period but it needed a bad mistake by Carroll in the 82nd minute to secure the breakthrough. He came for a cross and appeared to have collected it comfortably, only to drop it on landing. The ball squirmed its way to Junior Lewis on the edge of the penalty area and he showed a mature head to kick it over two defenders on the line. 'It was a real cool finish,' said Taylor. He could soon be saying the same about his Gillingham team.",

Within minutes of the final whistle, a group of around 150 angry supporters had gathered outside the main gates chanting 'We want our Tottenham back.' </p> <p>It had been planned anyway but its intensity was fuelled by a result that looked unthinkable after an hour, with Tottenham coasting thanks to goals by Steffen Iversen and Chris Armstrong and Villa looking a shadow of the side comfortably sixth in the Premiership as well as FA Cup finalists. </p> <p>Then Villa got a break, an assistant referee spotting the handball, missed by the referee Rob Harris, that enabled Dion Dublin to pull a goal back from the penalty spot and spark the remarkable revival. 'We were grateful to the linesman,' said Villa manager John Gregory, unlike his counterpart in rude health and due to run the London marathon this morning. 'He was 35 yards away to the ref's 10 and spotted it. Still, Mr Harris got the minute's silence for Hillsborough right.' </p> <p>It was a moment that showed again the brittle character of this Tottenham team; potentially fluent when things are going for them, usually porous when the going gets tougher.

David Ginola's pinpoint cross found the head of Iversen who had only to guide the ball home from six yards.

His indecision upset both John Gregory, who thought Iversen should have been sent off, and the Spurs assistant Stewart Houston, who conceded the handball but lamented the Barry foul. </p> <p>Dublin duly stroked home the penalty and Villa scented reprieve. Soon he had volleyed home the hitherto subdued Benito Carbone's cross with a brilliant overhead kick and Spurs were reeling. Next, the towering Dublin returned the compliment, heading down for Carbone to drive a curling shot into Ian Walker's top right corner. Finally, Walker's 250th Spurs appearance was further spoiled by Alan Wright's arrow-straight 25-yard half-volley into the goalkeeper's top left corner. </p> <p>After that, James grabbed Ginola's shot on his line at the second attempt and tipped over Clemence's shot but the Spurs' fans anger was reaching boiling point.

      "byline": "Kevin Mitchell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Wessels Johannes Cronje ended the week much as he had started it: international man of mystery. </p> <p>In the nine days since police in Delhi alleged he and three, possibly four, of his teammates had accepted money to fix matches against India, the South African captain has been variously depicted as duplicitous, upstanding, God-fearing, philandering, craven, cowardly, righteous, light-hearted. Walter Mitty never had as many lives. </p> <p>Perhaps the pain of this complex individual will be eased soon, however. The Observer has learned that, because of a procedural blunder in taping his claimed phone calls with the London-based bookmaker Sanjeev Chawla, Cronje will almost certainly never have to face the legal charges being made against him in India. </p> <p>While the emphasis in the internal investigation had quietly shifted into other areas of the South African team, the captain seemed to be emerging from the scandal with not only the sympathy of his countrymen growing by the day but with the immunity visited upon him by the incompetence of his prosecutors in Delhi. </p> <p>Also, a key element in his defence, but one on which few people have picked up on, was always going to be that he was not using his own mobile phone in India. 'I did take mine over but did not use it at all,' he said towards the end of an emotional press conference last Saturday. He had dropped his and broken it. According to one of his closest media friends, Trevor Chesterfield, the phone he used in taking calls from Chawla belonged to the team manager, Goolam Rajah. </p> <p>So the intrigue builds. Lawyers last night expressed scepticism that the police there had obtained the necessary permission before bugging Cronje's calls. Should the courts rule that the phone-tapping was unauthorised, the accused might be able to claim 'lack of due process'. </p> <p>Insiders say that many permission orders are passed after the tap has been carried out. In other cases, detectives simply browbeat telephone companies to co-operate without seeking formal clearance from the police commissioner or India's Home Secretary. </p> <p>In theory, the police are bound by regulations that the 'use of intercepted material shall be limited to the minimum'. This hardly squares with the press conference nine days ago in which Dr KK Paul, the head of Delhi police's crime branch, released the most damning extracts of the transcripts to a stunned public. </p> <p>In the unlikely event, then, that Cronje is ever extradited to India, prosecutors will struggle to secure a conviction. The likelihood is that the whole affair - like so many match-fixing allegations before - will be forgotten soon enough. </p> <p>Yet, as the International Cricket Council prepare to throw more platitudes at the problem tomorrow at what they laughingly describe as a crisis conference, denials continue to drown out the increasingly hysterical allegations. </p> <p>If the truth is to be found in among this mess, it will take a considerable shift in moral perception by everyone in the game, from players to officials, many of whom are jaded insiders well aware of the rumours at least going back to the Headingley Test of 1981. Public utterances don't always match whispered asides. One county cricketer told me recently players often bet on themselves. Not that they throw matches - but, if a tailender who fancies his chances with the bat spots his name at outrageous odds to top-score in a low-scoring match, and he has been exposed to the county game's gambling culture for any length of time, the odds are he will have a few bob on himself. What could be wrong with that, many will ask? Very little, surely. </p> <p>But, on the bigger stage, when serious money and very serious players are involved - people with criminal connections - the rules change. As we revealed in these pages last October after suspicions about Pakistan in the World Cup, the consequences of crossing the faceless string-pullers of international cricket betting on the sub-continent can be terminal. </p> <p>And still, not one investigation has yielded a single satisfactory result. The only player to be effectively ostracised is the volatile Pakistani batsman Salim Malik, who might count himself unfortunate when so many others named have drifted in and out of the punishment cell. </p> <p>But Hansie, as he is affectionately known by those who have come to admire his perceived rectitude, was always going to be treated differently. You only have to read the acres of testimonials to his character to understand that. He is honest, he is well-educated, he is tough and fair - he is white. </p> <p>Shamefully, most reasonable people would say, hi colour of skin and general respectability have changed the tenor of the debate. It was fine throwing mud at Pakistanis, and even colonial scallywags like Shane Warne and Steve Waugh, but this time the accusations are being levelled at cricketers whose propriety had supposedly set them as men apart - none more so than Cronje, a devout Christian from a deeply religious family. </p> <p>So who exactly is this man Cronje? Depends where you're coming from. </p> <p>'By the time we got to work on Friday morning,' recounts Ivor Powell of South Africa's liberal Mail and Guardian newspaper, 'there was already a pile of faxes nearly as thick as the telephone directory. The editor, Phillip van Niekerk, had already been on radio twice, defending the paper from more than robust attack.' </p> <p>What crime had been committed? It was the uncompromising message on their billboards all over the country: 'F*** you, Hansie Cronje.' As abrasive editorial comment, it was hard to match. The response, in graffiti everywhere, was just as virulent. 'F*** you, Mail and Guardian,' and 'F*** you 2'. </p> <p>Powell says, 'South Africa's biggest news agency threatened, before 10 o'clock in the morning to withdraw the title from all of its thousands of outlets - not only this edition, but in perpetuity. One fax threatened to withdraw 2,000 subscriptions; another just looped on the refrain men tioned at the top of this paragraph. One telephone caller said she always knew we were \"just communists_ no_ black-loving communists... no, no, black arse kissing communists_ but_\" </p> <p>'There were hundreds of callers in the course of the day. They were almost all white, and they were outraged, some simply because of the word, but mostly because we were breaking ranks. It was, as a colleague observed, like being in South Africa in the late Eighties, when truth mattered far less as a value than the solidarity of the \"volk\" and any questioning of authority was an automatic betrayal. We needed, we felt, to inject some reality, one way or another, into a situation that was growing increasingly bizarre.' </p> <p>This is not a picture you will have seen painted in many milder, more mainstream versions of events. But it reflects the real heat of the debate in South Africa, a debate drawn along clear racial lines. </p> <p>Cronje has always been represented - rightly so his friends say - as the ideal captain of a predominantly white sporting team to represent the rainbow nation. It is not that simple. </p> <p>Until his fall from grace, Cronje had been too good to be true. Part of a minor cricketing dynasty - his father also played for South Africa - in the Afrikaner hinterland of the Free State, Cronje made his provincial debut in 1987 at the age of 18. </p> <p>By the age of 21 he was captain, before being selected for the national team at the age of 23. Two years later he was the team's regular captain, becoming by the time of his dismissal this week the most successful captain in South African cricketing history. </p> <p>But, as Powell says, the Cronje story has many little twists in it. The 'legend version' has it that 'Cronje was a symbol of the Afrikaner's journey out of the lager of apartheid isolation to the brave new world of internationalism, a post-apartheid hero for those still struggling to cast off the shackles of an apartheid mindset'. </p> <p>He could also be an irritable adversary whose thirst for a win bordered on the fanatical. In 1998 the Australian press all but called him a cheat after television footage showed him rolling the ball under his studded foot during a one-day international. No official action was taken. During the same tour Cronje caused a stir when he hurled a stump through the door of the umpires' changing room after his side had lost a Test match they should have won in Adelaide. </p> <p>Last week was his trial. He did not come through it with the decorous calm you might expect of a man painted in heroic colours. He made a somewhat surly public appearance where he remained silent, with Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour, oddly, telling the world what Hansie had said, while Cronje's spiritual mentor, the former bodybuilder and charismatic pastor Ray McCaulay, looked on benignly in the background. </p> <p>The United Cricket Board announced it would be calling on government to institute a commission of inquiry. After meetings on Friday between government and the UCB, the commission was announced, but a judge is still being sought to head it. </p> <p>If the reaction seems a little uncommitted, it probably is. One cabinet minister frankly admitted that cricket was not top of the government agenda - the real consideration was how the scandal would impact on South Africa's bid to host the Football World Cup in 2006. </p> <p>It is white South Africa that cares passionately about cricket; black South Africa is hooked on football. Apartheid of a different sort, but separation just the same. </p> <p>It was the issue of bringing the communities together that, tangentially at least, might be at the heart of Cronje's present predicament.

      "bodyText": "Wessels Johannes Cronje ended the week much as he had started it: international man of mystery. In the nine days since police in Delhi alleged he and three, possibly four, of his teammates had accepted money to fix matches against India, the South African captain has been variously depicted as duplicitous, upstanding, God-fearing, philandering, craven, cowardly, righteous, light-hearted. Walter Mitty never had as many lives. Perhaps the pain of this complex individual will be eased soon, however. The Observer has learned that, because of a procedural blunder in taping his claimed phone calls with the London-based bookmaker Sanjeev Chawla, Cronje will almost certainly never have to face the legal charges being made against him in India. While the emphasis in the internal investigation had quietly shifted into other areas of the South African team, the captain seemed to be emerging from the scandal with not only the sympathy of his countrymen growing by the day but with the immunity visited upon him by the incompetence of his prosecutors in Delhi. Also, a key element in his defence, but one on which few people have picked up on, was always going to be that he was not using his own mobile phone in India. 'I did take mine over but did not use it at all,' he said towards the end of an emotional press conference last Saturday. He had dropped his and broken it. According to one of his closest media friends, Trevor Chesterfield, the phone he used in taking calls from Chawla belonged to the team manager, Goolam Rajah. So the intrigue builds. Lawyers last night expressed scepticism that the police there had obtained the necessary permission before bugging Cronje's calls. Should the courts rule that the phone-tapping was unauthorised, the accused might be able to claim 'lack of due process'. Insiders say that many permission orders are passed after the tap has been carried out. In other cases, detectives simply browbeat telephone companies to co-operate without seeking formal clearance from the police commissioner or India's Home Secretary. In theory, the police are bound by regulations that the 'use of intercepted material shall be limited to the minimum'. This hardly squares with the press conference nine days ago in which Dr KK Paul, the head of Delhi police's crime branch, released the most damning extracts of the transcripts to a stunned public. In the unlikely event, then, that Cronje is ever extradited to India, prosecutors will struggle to secure a conviction. The likelihood is that the whole affair - like so many match-fixing allegations before - will be forgotten soon enough. Yet, as the International Cricket Council prepare to throw more platitudes at the problem tomorrow at what they laughingly describe as a crisis conference, denials continue to drown out the increasingly hysterical allegations. If the truth is to be found in among this mess, it will take a considerable shift in moral perception by everyone in the game, from players to officials, many of whom are jaded insiders well aware of the rumours at least going back to the Headingley Test of 1981. Public utterances don't always match whispered asides. One county cricketer told me recently players often bet on themselves. Not that they throw matches - but, if a tailender who fancies his chances with the bat spots his name at outrageous odds to top-score in a low-scoring match, and he has been exposed to the county game's gambling culture for any length of time, the odds are he will have a few bob on himself. What could be wrong with that, many will ask? Very little, surely. But, on the bigger stage, when serious money and very serious players are involved - people with criminal connections - the rules change. As we revealed in these pages last October after suspicions about Pakistan in the World Cup, the consequences of crossing the faceless string-pullers of international cricket betting on the sub-continent can be terminal. And still, not one investigation has yielded a single satisfactory result. The only player to be effectively ostracised is the volatile Pakistani batsman Salim Malik, who might count himself unfortunate when so many others named have drifted in and out of the punishment cell. But Hansie, as he is affectionately known by those who have come to admire his perceived rectitude, was always going to be treated differently. You only have to read the acres of testimonials to his character to understand that. He is honest, he is well-educated, he is tough and fair - he is white. Shamefully, most reasonable people would say, hi colour of skin and general respectability have changed the tenor of the debate. It was fine throwing mud at Pakistanis, and even colonial scallywags like Shane Warne and Steve Waugh, but this time the accusations are being levelled at cricketers whose propriety had supposedly set them as men apart - none more so than Cronje, a devout Christian from a deeply religious family. So who exactly is this man Cronje? Depends where you're coming from. 'By the time we got to work on Friday morning,' recounts Ivor Powell of South Africa's liberal Mail and Guardian newspaper, 'there was already a pile of faxes nearly as thick as the telephone directory. The editor, Phillip van Niekerk, had already been on radio twice, defending the paper from more than robust attack.' What crime had been committed? It was the uncompromising message on their billboards all over the country: 'F*** you, Hansie Cronje.' As abrasive editorial comment, it was hard to match. The response, in graffiti everywhere, was just as virulent. 'F*** you, Mail and Guardian,' and 'F*** you 2'. Powell says, 'South Africa's biggest news agency threatened, before 10 o'clock in the morning to withdraw the title from all of its thousands of outlets - not only this edition, but in perpetuity. One fax threatened to withdraw 2,000 subscriptions; another just looped on the refrain men tioned at the top of this paragraph. One telephone caller said she always knew we were \"just communists_ no_ black-loving communists... no, no, black arse kissing communists_ but_\" 'There were hundreds of callers in the course of the day. They were almost all white, and they were outraged, some simply because of the word, but mostly because we were breaking ranks. It was, as a colleague observed, like being in South Africa in the late Eighties, when truth mattered far less as a value than the solidarity of the \"volk\" and any questioning of authority was an automatic betrayal. We needed, we felt, to inject some reality, one way or another, into a situation that was growing increasingly bizarre.' This is not a picture you will have seen painted in many milder, more mainstream versions of events. But it reflects the real heat of the debate in South Africa, a debate drawn along clear racial lines. Cronje has always been represented - rightly so his friends say - as the ideal captain of a predominantly white sporting team to represent the rainbow nation. It is not that simple. Until his fall from grace, Cronje had been too good to be true. Part of a minor cricketing dynasty - his father also played for South Africa - in the Afrikaner hinterland of the Free State, Cronje made his provincial debut in 1987 at the age of 18. By the age of 21 he was captain, before being selected for the national team at the age of 23. Two years later he was the team's regular captain, becoming by the time of his dismissal this week the most successful captain in South African cricketing history. But, as Powell says, the Cronje story has many little twists in it. The 'legend version' has it that 'Cronje was a symbol of the Afrikaner's journey out of the lager of apartheid isolation to the brave new world of internationalism, a post-apartheid hero for those still struggling to cast off the shackles of an apartheid mindset'. He could also be an irritable adversary whose thirst for a win bordered on the fanatical. In 1998 the Australian press all but called him a cheat after television footage showed him rolling the ball under his studded foot during a one-day international. No official action was taken. During the same tour Cronje caused a stir when he hurled a stump through the door of the umpires' changing room after his side had lost a Test match they should have won in Adelaide. Last week was his trial. He did not come through it with the decorous calm you might expect of a man painted in heroic colours. He made a somewhat surly public appearance where he remained silent, with Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour, oddly, telling the world what Hansie had said, while Cronje's spiritual mentor, the former bodybuilder and charismatic pastor Ray McCaulay, looked on benignly in the background. The United Cricket Board announced it would be calling on government to institute a commission of inquiry. After meetings on Friday between government and the UCB, the commission was announced, but a judge is still being sought to head it. If the reaction seems a little uncommitted, it probably is. One cabinet minister frankly admitted that cricket was not top of the government agenda - the real consideration was how the scandal would impact on South Africa's bid to host the Football World Cup in 2006. It is white South Africa that cares passionately about cricket; black South Africa is hooked on football. Apartheid of a different sort, but separation just the same. It was the issue of bringing the communities together that, tangentially at least, might be at the heart of Cronje's present predicament. It has been widely acknowledged that he stormed out of a meeting two years ago with Ali Bacher when the man who has striven to restore South Africa's credibility after decades of the boycott suggested the quota system proposed by the government should at least be tried. Cronje was defiantly opposed to it. He argued (not without some support in the black community) that Test players should be picked solely on merit. The two were not so united last week that even a passing inspection of their media appearances did not reveal simmering tension. Cronje back-tracked on Bacher's original statement that he, Cronje, had accepted between $10,000 and $15,000. He later recanted, but insisted he had not done anything to damage South Africa's reputation, nor had any of his teammates. Yesterday, Herschelle Gibbs, one of the others accused, broke his silence. 'I felt bad but I knew I was innocent,' he told the Cape Argus . 'Nothing would ever make me do something irresponsible. I think somebody who would become involved in anything like this would have let their country down, and themselves and the team. It is terribly unprofessional.' He added: 'Nobody approached us. When we were told about it, we were terribly shocked.' Again it is a denial littered with escape clauses, as was Cronje's assertion that he had not been 'entirely honest'.

I've known him for a good few years and I've still got the utmost respect for him. He will always be a great friend of mine.' There is a theory that Cronje has fallen on his sword for the good of his fellow-accused. This might be the case. But he has done so reluctantly, flushed out by media insistence and without the fulsome explanation that the doubters still demand. In the eyes of his public, however, the more he is flogged, the more he is loved. The Johannesburg Star surveyed South African opinion and found that 94 per cent of respondents supported Cronje and/or believed he was innocent. Callers on talk radio were equally vocal in their belief that, even if Hansie had erred, he should be forgiven. Perhaps this is the proper Christian response.

      "body": "<p>It was Mumbai's best kept secret. On 12 March, several hours before South Africa and India took to the field in Bihar, India's poorest and most chaotic state, six of the city's underworld bookmakers held a discreet meeting. They knew something the other bookmakers did not. South Africa, they felt confident, would lose the match. </p> <p>Their confidence was not merely based on a hunch. According to police sources in Mumbai, the six had advanced huge sums to Sanjay Chawla, the London-based bookmaker, to bribe the South African captain Hansie Cronje. Cronje's forecasts for the previous one-day match in Cochin had proved erratic. But this time he did not disappoint, it is alleged. </p> <p>Cronje's side won the toss but managed to notch up only 199 runs. India swiftly swept past that total with the loss of four wickets. The ground at Jamshedpur, a previously unremarkable steel city, rang with Indian cheers. 'It was a very comfortable victory,' a spokesman from India's Board of Cricket Control declared. </p> <p>The fallout in Mumbai from South Africa's poor performance was swift and devastating. It tore like a hurricane through the city's vast illegal betting industry. While those few in the know celebrated, Mumbai's other illegal syndicates - who had backed an in-form South Africa to win -- faced terminal losses of \u00a3150,000 each. </p> <p>'The six have gone underground but we know who they are,' one police source said yesterday. 'Only these six knew that South Africa would lose the match. They had provided money to Sanjay Chawla.' </p> <p>Police activity has now shifted from Delhi to Mumbai, with speculation yesterday that a local politician may be involved. Police are already examining telephone records from the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai, where both Chawla and Cronje stayed between 20-24 February, well before the now infamous one-day series began on 9 March. </p> <p>The tentacles of the betting industry, however, stretch much further to Karachi, Pakistan's lawless port city, and into the Gulf, where one-day tournaments are held at Sharjah. In another intriguing twist, police now believe Chawla may have stopped off in Dubai before returning to London, where he is now in hiding. Players, coaches, sports journalists and pundits are all involved, detectives believe. </p> <p>Now picture the scene in the kitchen of a small house in Delhi. In one corner is a table covered with papers under which three telephones are half buried. </p> <p>Three busy men operate the phones and at the height of activity there is a call every 20 seconds. Three more keep records. The boss phones round the world for updates on a variety of matches or barks an order to bring down the odds on one player and raise them on another.

      "bodyText": "It was Mumbai's best kept secret. On 12 March, several hours before South Africa and India took to the field in Bihar, India's poorest and most chaotic state, six of the city's underworld bookmakers held a discreet meeting. They knew something the other bookmakers did not. South Africa, they felt confident, would lose the match. Their confidence was not merely based on a hunch. According to police sources in Mumbai, the six had advanced huge sums to Sanjay Chawla, the London-based bookmaker, to bribe the South African captain Hansie Cronje. Cronje's forecasts for the previous one-day match in Cochin had proved erratic. But this time he did not disappoint, it is alleged. Cronje's side won the toss but managed to notch up only 199 runs. India swiftly swept past that total with the loss of four wickets. The ground at Jamshedpur, a previously unremarkable steel city, rang with Indian cheers. 'It was a very comfortable victory,' a spokesman from India's Board of Cricket Control declared. The fallout in Mumbai from South Africa's poor performance was swift and devastating. It tore like a hurricane through the city's vast illegal betting industry. While those few in the know celebrated, Mumbai's other illegal syndicates - who had backed an in-form South Africa to win -- faced terminal losses of \u00a3150,000 each. 'The six have gone underground but we know who they are,' one police source said yesterday. 'Only these six knew that South Africa would lose the match. They had provided money to Sanjay Chawla.' Police activity has now shifted from Delhi to Mumbai, with speculation yesterday that a local politician may be involved. Police are already examining telephone records from the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai, where both Chawla and Cronje stayed between 20-24 February, well before the now infamous one-day series began on 9 March. The tentacles of the betting industry, however, stretch much further to Karachi, Pakistan's lawless port city, and into the Gulf, where one-day tournaments are held at Sharjah. In another intriguing twist, police now believe Chawla may have stopped off in Dubai before returning to London, where he is now in hiding. Players, coaches, sports journalists and pundits are all involved, detectives believe. Now picture the scene in the kitchen of a small house in Delhi. In one corner is a table covered with papers under which three telephones are half buried. Three busy men operate the phones and at the height of activity there is a call every 20 seconds. Three more keep records. The boss phones round the world for updates on a variety of matches or barks an order to bring down the odds on one player and raise them on another. There's a man to watch the television set that blares so loudly that only the man working his phone can hear it. When all three ring at the same time the noise is deafening. And sometimes one of the men will turn up the radio so that he can check the way a match is going. Bedlam. A phone rings. 'Hai!' A pause as the punter sets up the bet. 'The odds are 75-100.' Another pause. 'Done.' No hello and no farewell. No 'and how's the wife' or a comment on the weather. In seven seconds it's all finished. Although two engine-driven mini taxis and man-propelled rickshaws stand outside the house, you will not find many willing to take you there. If you want a bet you have to rely on a hotel servant slipping you a phone number on a scrap of paper. Even then you may receive a mysterious visitor to check you out and if there is any doubt about your bone fides that number will go out of action immediately. Once the phone is slammed down, a bet for as little as 100 rupees or as much as a 100,000 is made. A scratched note on a pad in curling Hindi script is the only record. One man controls much of the overall Indian betting empire: Dawood Ibrahim, Mumbai's most celebrated mafia don, who manages his illegal businesses from Pakistan. Police only stumbled upon Cronje's involvement in match-fixing while investigating an extortion plot by Ibrahim's gang involving a Delhi tyre company.

The issue of betting, instead of falling under the vague umbrella of 'bringing the game into disrepute', will be spelt out. Rules will state that players, match officials, or officers of any professional club cannot bet on a match in which they or their club are playing. </p> <p>There is a culture of cricketers throughout the ages enjoying a bet, though until recently it was mostly on the horses. One current county player reckons that at least a third of today's professionals are punters with their own accounts. While they do not bet on their own matches, there is concern that the relationship between players, pundits - there's always plenty of activity in the Press and broadcasting boxes - and bookmakers is too cosy. </p> <p>The publicity director of Sporting Index, one of five spread betting companies in the UK, is indeed a recently retired professional cricketer, Graham Cowdrey, and he stresses how anxious he is that investigations into the Cronje affair are speedy and comprehensive. However he does not believe that spread betting in this country - which unlike betting with bookmakers is regulated by the Stock Exchange - in any way undermines the integrity of the game. </p> <p>'Everyone has jumped on the bandwagon here suggesting that it's a spread betting problem,' he says. 'But the Cronje affair is not a problem for us. We don't bet on sub-continent games unless they involve England or are part of a World Cup. And they have to be televised here to attract our punters. We had no markets during the recent India- South Africa series.' </p> <p>There is very little spread betting, as we know it, in India, contrary to many theories expounded in the past few days, but there are markets on an individual batsman's score and many other 'novelty' bets. All cricket betting is illegal in India but the network is huge and cricket dominates the market. </p> <p>A popular bet is an 'over-under' which is less sophisticated than spreads. These are straight bets with fixed odds on whether, for example, Herschelle Gibbs will score more than 20 or less than 20. The return for the punter is the same whether he scores nought or 19 going low; 36 or 136 going high. </p> <p>Sporting Index offer a wide selection of quirky markets - 'fun bets for fun punters' as Cowdrey describes them. In the World Cup you could bet on the number of sightings of John Major on TV or 'Strapping Jocks', the number of sixes hit by Scottish batsmen in the tournament. These are attention seekers, but not big money spinners. </p> <p>'The serious punters,' says Cowdrey, 'bet on markets like the number of runs a particular player may score in the series or the team score in any innings.' </p> <p>The only market they have ever closed was the timing of the first throw-in in football after West Ham famously booted the ball into touch three seconds into a match. He's confident that they would spot a scam swiftly. If they did they would inform the relevant sporting authority immediately. </p> <p>There are spread bet markets on domestic cricket in England, notably on televised one-day matches. 'We have professional cricketers - and golfers - as clients and they can trade as long as they are not betting on games or tournaments in which they are participating.' </p> <p>Do they get preferential terms since they could be a source of valuable information? 'Absolutely not,' says Cowdrey. 'They have no special arrangements. We are desperate for information. It's crucial to get it half an hour ahead of the others, but we won't pay for it from players or coaches. If our clients believe we have an unfair advantage, they'll give up.' Cricket constitutes six per cent of their business (far less with the high street bookmakers). Football predominates with 60-65 per cent. </p> <p>Such a selection of markets must whet the appetite of the gambling man. Take Jack Bannister, for example, for 20 years a Warwickshire professional cricketer, then a bookmaker, now a cricketing broadcaster and journalist and therefore in an ideal position to monitor the relationship between cricket and betting. </p> <p>Bannister confirms that there were plenty of copies of Sporting Life in the dressing rooms of the Fifties. 'Until 1963 we could only bet on the horses. Then the Gillette Cup was started and I can remember having the opportunity - and taking it - of a wager on Sussex to win the trophy along with my old team-mate Ray Hitchcock.' </p> <p>One-day cricket created a new, though limited market for cricket punters. Bannister recalls that as a bookmaker in 1973 he offered bets on all competitions and it was worth his while to take out advertisements in the cricket magazines. From his own painful personal experience he can chart the emergence of spread betting. </p> <p>'It was in 1993. Warwickshire were in the final of the NatWest and I'd had a chat with the umpires and several players and all of them said the wicket was soft, tricky for batting. All agreed that 240 was likely to be the maximum score. What happened? Sussex scored 321 and Warwickshire got them.' That heavy loss was enough to remind him of the wise words of William Hill, who told Bannister as a youngster 'Never bet on anything that talks.' This still seems like a damned good policy. </p> <p>Of course cricket and betting goes back way beyond the Bannister era. Just in case you are concocting a thesis focusing on the decay of modern society, remember that William Lambert, the best all-rounder of his day, was banished from the game for 'selling' a match between Nottinghamshire and England in 1817.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> THE BATTLE FOR </strong> that second automatic promotion spot in the First Division was given another dose of tension yesterday with the gap between Manchester City and Ipswich cut to one point. </p> <p>City were disappointing at Grimsby, where they failed to capitalise on a Spencer Prior headed goal after only six minutes. Grimsby were able to get back on level terms 10 minutes later, through Alan Pouton - his first goal for the club - and from that point, City were very much on the back foot.</p> <p>Steve Livingstone and Lee Ashcroft both squandered good chances to put Grimsby ahead; and seven minutes from the end, City seemed fortunate not to have Danny Tiatto sent off for apparently hauling Kevin Donovan down from behind when the Grimsby man had a clear run on goal. City's manager, Joe Royle, admitted: 'It was a good point for us because we did not deserve any more.'</p> <p>The result for Ipswich was even better. They won 1-0 at Stockport, thanks to a David Johnson goal just before half time. It stemmed from a clearance by Ipswich keeper Richard Wright and brought Johnson's total for the season to 19.</p> <p> <strong> THE SURPRISE OF</strong> the day was surely Birmingham's 1-0 defeat at home to Nottingham Forest. However, Birmingham did have a good excuse - an own goal by Darren Purse.</p> <p>Wolves, the leaders of the small group of teams still hoping to break into the play-off zone, also went down 1-0, at Norwich.

      "bodyText": "THE BATTLE FOR that second automatic promotion spot in the First Division was given another dose of tension yesterday with the gap between Manchester City and Ipswich cut to one point. City were disappointing at Grimsby, where they failed to capitalise on a Spencer Prior headed goal after only six minutes. Grimsby were able to get back on level terms 10 minutes later, through Alan Pouton - his first goal for the club - and from that point, City were very much on the back foot. Steve Livingstone and Lee Ashcroft both squandered good chances to put Grimsby ahead; and seven minutes from the end, City seemed fortunate not to have Danny Tiatto sent off for apparently hauling Kevin Donovan down from behind when the Grimsby man had a clear run on goal. City's manager, Joe Royle, admitted: 'It was a good point for us because we did not deserve any more.' The result for Ipswich was even better. They won 1-0 at Stockport, thanks to a David Johnson goal just before half time. It stemmed from a clearance by Ipswich keeper Richard Wright and brought Johnson's total for the season to 19. THE SURPRISE OF the day was surely Birmingham's 1-0 defeat at home to Nottingham Forest. However, Birmingham did have a good excuse - an own goal by Darren Purse. Wolves, the leaders of the small group of teams still hoping to break into the play-off zone, also went down 1-0, at Norwich. They had Simon Osborn sent off for a second bookable offence. THE MOST ENTERTAINING match was Bolton's 4-4 draw at West Bromwich Albion. The home team were ahead three times but were eventually denied victory by Gudni Bergsson. The Icelandic star, the longest-serving foreign import in the English game, scored the second of his two goals in the 90th minute - two minutes after Adam Oliver had put West Brom 4-3 ahead. THE ONLY NATIONWIDE team to have scored more goals than Charlton are Barnsley, who brought their total to 84 with the 2-2 draw at Port Vale. It was hardly surprising that one of their goals came from Craig Hignett, arguably their most effective attacking player this season. Hignett - who has scored 19 goals this season - said: 'It is a big change from my Middlesbrough days.

'Ronaldo loads his right knee. In difficult moments a great part of his weight is concentrated on that point,' says Trabattoni. </p> <p>In Brazil questions are being asked about where that weight has come from. There is a belief his knees are unable to cope with the heaviness of his upper body and thighs. His latest comeback, four months after an operation to his troubled right knee, lasted just six minutes and the manner of his downfall seemed to support Trabattoni's theory. </p> <p>Ronaldo, on as a second-half substitute in Inter's Italian Cup final with Lazio, ran at the defence with his upper body swerving, offering a brief glimpse of the player we once knew. Then he fell to the floor, screaming in pain having ruptured the same kneecap tendon which had caused his absence for much of the season. </p> <p>When Ronaldo left Cruzeiro in 1994, at the age of 17, to join PSV Eindhoven, he was over 5ft 10in tall and weighed nearly 12st. Six years later, he stands one-and-half inches taller and over a stone heavier. </p> <p>Moises Cohen, who last year operated on the knee of Brazilian veteran Rai and is considered one of Brazil's leading specialists, told the sports daily Lance : 'If we compare the Ronaldo of PSV Eindhoven with the Ronaldo who went on to the field against Lazio, we can see that they are two different people. He has a different build. Only his teeth are the same. </p> <p>'Nature didn't produce his body to have the weight that it carries today. Ronaldo is the most famous case. But every day I see athletes, from various sports, increasing their muscular mass artificially. This provokes terrible anomalies in their bodily systems, which, inevitably, create problems.' </p> <p>The mysteries continue and the lack of clarity about Ronaldo's injuries is hardly helped by Inter's determination to play down every setback. Last season Ronaldo opened up about his injury, admitting in a television interview that he was suffering from a 'chronic' knee problem. </p> <p>The following day Inter claimed the buck-toothed Brazilian had made a linguistic error and that he merely meant to say he had a 'long-running' knee problem. </p> <p>However, even Inter's spin doctors have been unable to offer an explanation for what happened to Ronaldo before the 1998 World Cup final when the Italian club criticised the decision to play him after he fell ill before the game, apparently suffering from convulsions. </p> <p>The world could see something was not right as Ronaldo wandered the field in a daze as Brazil lost to France. But neither Inter nor Brazil offered a reason over what caused him to pass out in his hotel room - epilepsy, a reaction to pain killers and other theories have been denied, but no answers given. Both anti-epilepsy tablet and painkillers such as cortisone are known to weaken knee tendons. </p> <p>There is also a suspicion that the player's commercial backers are too eager to see him back on the field. Ronaldo's annual earnings from endorsements for a range of companies are reported to be \u00a35 million, on top of his yearly salary of around \u00a33 million paid by Inter and the club's backers Pirelli. That is around \u00a3160,000 a week. </p> <p>Following Thursday's latest operation it will be another eight months before the former World Player of the Year can play again. But while Inter, as usual, talk optimistically of his return next season, the way in which he collapsed has prompted fears that his career may be over. </p> <p>The problems with Ronaldo's right knee go back to his first operation in 1996 when he was still playing in Holland for PSV Eindhoven. During his season with Barcelona, and his successful start to his career in Italy the problem appeared to fade. But the pain reappeared during the 1998 World Cup finals and four times last season he was sidelined with injuries. </p> <p>Inter were criticised for rushing him back, particularly after his hapless performance against Manchester United in the Champions League where he was clearly not fit. Some suggest he has been the victim of the same policy this time. </p> <p>Former Brazil international Zico, who himself never recovered from a knee injury sustained in 1985, said: 'I don't agree with the way Ronaldo came back into the team, always with the idea of it being as quickly as possible. I think it was absurd for him to come on in the second half of a decisive game such as the one against Lazio. It would have been better if he had played a couple of friendlies first.' </p> <p>Inter say his return had been sanctioned by the man who carried out his operation - French knee specialist Gerard Saillant. Saillant has gained a reputation as the surgeon to sporting stars, particularly after he helped Michael Schumacher back to fitness after his Silverstone crash last year. </p> <p>The French professor has defended his decision to allow Ronaldo back on to the field. 'Ronaldo trained in public for two weeks before his comeback and he was 100 percent,' he said, 'He collapsed the third time he put his weight on his knee.' </p> <p>While no one in Italy questions Saillant's approach, there has been criticism in Brazil of the player's personal physio, Brazilian Nilton Petroni. Like Saillant, he is sought by top athletes to help swift recovery from injury and last December Ronaldo left Milan to train with Petroni in Brazil. He will do the same now. </p> <p>Yet Nivaldo Baldo, a leading Brazilian physiotherapist, said: 'The big problem with Ronaldo's injuries are the mysteries which surround them. I don't agree with a lot of the procedures adopted by Petroni during Ronaldo's recovery.' </p> <p>Ever since the World Cup final, another of his backers, sportswear giants Nike , who have a lifetime contract with the player worth a reported $3.2 m a year, have been seen as the villains of the piece. Although the company denied they were responsible for Ronaldo playing in the final, they have come under fire for putting the player through too many games as part of their massive sponsorship deal with Brazil. </p> <p>Nike's Brazil spokesman Ingo Ostrovsky said: 'Nike and Ronaldo have a long relationship and the company will continue backing him.' But Brazilian marketing experts say if his career were to end now, he would be useless for promoting sports products. 'Maybe mobile phones or cars,' said one. 'But if he stops playing now, his image as an athlete is over.' </p> <p>There is another incentive for Ronaldo to return. According to Gazzetta della Sport , Inter have insurance policies worth \u00a365m if Ronaldo's career was ended by injury. But the policies do not pay out if the injury is to his troubled right knee.</p>",

Neither Stoke City, managed until mid-November by Gary Megson, nor Bristol City, until four months ago led by Tony Pulis, were faring particularly poorly in the Second Division when the switches were made due, basically, to the vagaries of geography. Megson's Stoke were eighth when an Icelandic consortium took charge and installed former national team manager Gudjon Thordarson, who today becomes the first Scandinavian to take charge of a club for a domestic Wembley cup final. Meanwhile, on a sodden January night when Bristol City, having risen comfortably into mid-table, were chiselling a way past Cheltenham Town in this competition's second round, Pulis, only six months into the job, was preparing to leave Ashton Gate to take charge at Portsmouth, primarily because of its proximity to his Dorset home. His successor, Tony Fawthrop, who has scouted at City for 11 years, promptly won the divisional manager of the month award for February, and was asked to take care until the end of the season. This afternoon the 57-year-old will become the first caretaker-manager to lead out a team out for a domestic Wembley cup final. Fawthrop and Thordarson will then meet England coach Kevin Keegan, chief guest for the day, and stand proudly by their teams as Abide With Me , the traditional FA Cup anthem, is played in memory of the late Sir Stanley Matthews, the Stoke City legend. It should be quite an occasion, probably the last time any team will be supported at Wembley by so many of their own fans: Stoke have sold their 36,000 allocation and Bristol City just about all their 35,000. Thordarson, who twice managed IA Akranes to the Icelandic domestic double (in 1993 and 1996) and took KR of Reykjavik to two cup victories (in 1994 and 1995), is something of a legend in Iceland. He has not lost a domestic cup tie since 1992 (Stoke were already out of the major knockouts on his arrival) and made such progress with the national side that they almsot qualified for Euro 2000, only losing 3-2 to the world champions France in his last game last autumn. 'When I arrived here in mid-November, I never had it in my mind I'd be leading Stoke out at Wembley by mid-April,' he said. 'But we worked hard, me and the players, in the wind and the rain at Chesterfield and Blackpool, and I am very proud to get to Wembley.'

Starting today, this week will show how important is the game in the lives, and the healing process, of a city in mourning. </p> <p>This weekend the mind has inevitably returned to the tragic events at Hillsborough on the 11th anniversary of the 96 deaths. Then, in the wider scheme, football did indeed become an irrelevance - until it emerged that the people of Liverpool wanted the FA Cup to be completed. Duly it was, on an uplifting afternoon at Wembley as their team won the trophy with Everton fittingly playing their part in the extra-time redemption. </p> <p>Who knows how it will end for Leeds United this season? Perhaps today's Premiership game against Arsenal, who play in Lens this week, offers a glimpse of the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen in a month's time. What can be said is that after the funerals of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight on Monday and Tuesday this week, Thursday's potentially powder keg return against Galatasaray represents a chance to fulfil - healthily - some unfinished business with the Turks. </p> <p>It was clearly difficult for the shattered Leeds youngsters to perform properly in the Ali Sami Yen stadium 10 days ago and it has been argued here that the result should have been expunged and a one-off semi-final re-arranged, behind closed doors on neutral territory. Now that Uefa have reluctantly but necessarily accepted the need for an away-fan ban at Elland Road as a damage-limitation move, fingers can only be crossed that all will respond with the restraint being called for by police. </p> <p>Reports from Turkey suggest that fans there, along with many Galatasaray exiles in London, will defy the ban. That was the view of many supporters on Friday night as they streamed from the Besiktas Stadium after Galatasaray grabbed an uninspiring 1-1 draw in the Istanbul derby. There was a tragic backdrop to that game. A Turkish man was stabbed to death after a row broke out between two men watching the derby on television in a coffee house in the city. </p> <p>Those defiant fans should realise just how inflammatory a gesture travelling to Leeds would be by imagining how it would be regarded if a host of English fans descended upon their country a fortnight after two of their number had been murdered. </p> <p>For Leeds supporters, meanwhile, it is an opportunity to counter the reports that came out of Turkey that the behaviour of some of them was provocative and instead present the less aggressive, maybe even forgiving face of the English game as exhibited by its decent followers. </p> <p>Understandably, many may still be in the anger stage of their grieving process in Leeds, fuelled by outrageous suggestions from the Turkish sports minister that the club is trying to profit from the deaths to come through the tie - when clearly the Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale has always sought to respond appropriately and honourably. Disdain rather than violence is surely a better response. </p> <p>In the angry aftermath, there have been many hot-headed statements in the press of both nations but Fikret Unlu's - taking in racism, opportunism and England's fitness or otherwise to stage a World Cup - has been the most offensive. Many Turks, though, have also decried it; besides which, the authorities there have moved swiftly to charge four men with the murders. </p> <p>While Ridsdale has done much on behalf of the club to lead the community healing, now it falls also to the team to try and lift their city through their efforts on the pitch. It may be asking too much of them to win today - after all, they have lost three games in a row while Arsenal are on a run of three wins - and re-establish their Champions League credentials, but a spirited performance will do much to cheer supporters in their first home game since Galatasaray. </p> <p>Then, on Thursday, if the crowd respond with the more acceptable face of English fan passion, Leeds can yet turn around the 2-0 deficit. It may not be the revenge that the more rabid would prefer but it would surely be more satisfying. </p> <p>'Even the second leg remains meaningless in the circumstances. It is immaterial when judged against two people's lives,' says Peter Ridsdale. You know what he means, and hesitate to disagree, not having had the unhappy experience of walking a mile in his shoes.

      "bodyText": "Football matters little in these circumstances, it is said. In the wake of the death of the two Leeds fans, it is unimportant. In fact, the opposite is true. Starting today, this week will show how important is the game in the lives, and the healing process, of a city in mourning. This weekend the mind has inevitably returned to the tragic events at Hillsborough on the 11th anniversary of the 96 deaths. Then, in the wider scheme, football did indeed become an irrelevance - until it emerged that the people of Liverpool wanted the FA Cup to be completed. Duly it was, on an uplifting afternoon at Wembley as their team won the trophy with Everton fittingly playing their part in the extra-time redemption. Who knows how it will end for Leeds United this season? Perhaps today's Premiership game against Arsenal, who play in Lens this week, offers a glimpse of the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen in a month's time.

Manchester United versus Real Madrid is a fixture with resonance, and Old Trafford will be packed to the rafters to watch it. </p> <p>'There's a nostalgic connotation which goes right back to the early days of the European Cup,' the United manager explained. 'The Busby Babes played Real Madrid, then the side which won in 1968 beat them on the way to the final.' </p> <p>Ferguson imagined Real felt the same way about United, especially now they are defending champions, and was a little shocked to see empty seats at the Bernabeu for the scoreless first leg. But the revamped and absurdly bloated Champions League has not been the success with continental spectators it has on these shores, which is why Uefa are already talking about streamlining the competition. 'Presumably that means reducing the number of matches, and as long as we can keep the quality I would be in favour of that,' Ferguson said. 'Seventeen matches in a European campaign is a lot, and so much depends on what sort of a group you find yourself in. Last season, for example, we were in a group with Bayern Munich and Barcelona so it was exciting from the word go. This time, with due respect to Sturm Graz and Croatia Zagreb, it wasn't quite the same and we didn't really get going in the first phase. We got through and that was all.' </p> <p>After berating his players for a careless performance in the first leg Fergu son would like to see United turn on the style on Wednesday. He would not say no to a scrappy 1-0 victory, of course, but Ferguson believes teams should be true to their instincts and knows a big match in front of a demanding home crowd can bring the best out of his players. 'Drawing 0-0 was not the perfect result away from home, because Real now know they can change things round with a goal at Old Trafford, but all we've got to do is win on the night. It's like a league match now, we need to win but that is a challenge we can respond to. Our home form has been good, so the situation is perfect for us.' </p> <p>True enough, but the situation isn't bad for Vicente Del Bosque's team either. Even though Real's home form since the first leg has amounted to a victory over Celta Vigo by a single Raul goal and a dreary 0-0 draw with Espanyol, last year's runners up in the Spanish league are sufficiently lively in attack to fancy their chances of a goal or two. Hierro and Roberto Carlos are both expected to return on Wednesday, though if Nicolas Anelka is to figure Ferguson fancies it will only be from the substitutes' bench. 'I can't see him playing from the start, it would be too much of a risk,' he said. 'I don't think they will be leaving out Raul or Morientes.' </p> <p>Those two players plus Steve McManaman came perilously close to sending United to defeat in the Bernabeu, and because the tie is so evenly balanced Ferguson is sure they will be similarly deployed away from home. </p> <p>'Real won't come to defend, they will play the way they believe in,' he said. 'They have a lot of nice footballers, and Raul and Morientes are talented players. They will put their faith in their attacking ability, which is admirable. That's what we plan to do too though, so there should be goals in this game.' </p> <p>There should have been goals in the last game, of course, there were certainly plenty of goal chances. The best fell to McManaman and Andy Cole, and it is fair to say the United fans were more surprised than their Spanish counterparts when their man missed a sitter. Cole has been clinical for most of the season, though even had his first leg header gone in United would still find themselves approaching the second game in the same way - wanting to win. </p> <p>'It's what we prefer,' Ferguson said. 'We will play much better, we know that. Our home record will carry us through.'</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>This month English football has overtaken Italian football as the best in Europe. How has that happened?</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This month English football has overtaken Italian football as the best in Europe. This is generally understood, but what most people have missed is why that happened, and just how crucial this week's Champions League quarter-finals will be. If Manchester United and Chelsea overcome Real Madrid and Barcelona, and if Lazio, the only Italian side left in the competition, are knocked out by Valencia - and all that seems likely - then English clubs could dominate Europe for years. </p> <p>It so happens that I know how English football reached this exalted point. That is because my previous job was as currency correspondent for the Financial Times , where I wrote a daily column explaining why some currencies had risen while others had fallen. </p> <p>Every day around noon, a few minutes after I arrived, a graphics designer named Graham would come to my desk. Graham's job was to draw the daily chart that accompanied the column, but before we could discuss that, he would talk about Chelsea. </p> <p>Initially, this was rather depressing. 'Furlong aaargh blah blah, Gavin Peacock blah blah, draw maybe next week blah blah,' would be a typical monologue. </p> <p>Gradually, it changed. 'We've signed Ed de Goey,' Graham might say, or 'We're in for Tore Andre Flo.' Later, as the stresses of his job got to him, Graham began claiming that Chelsea had bought Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly. </p> <p>Eventually he would ask what chart he should draw. 'Pound against the D-Mark,' I would reply. 'Did that on Tuesday,' Graham would say. 'Pound's up massively again,' I would explain. </p> <p>It took me a while to realise that the rise of Chelsea and the rise of sterling were two sides of the same pound coin. Over the past five years the pound has jumped almost 50 per cent against European currencies. Unfortunate as that is for British exporters, it is good news for football fans. When a British club offers \u00a310 million for an Italian-based player, the Italian club converts the sum into lira and finds it worth almost half as much again as it would have been in 1995. The foreign player produces a calculator, converts his salary into pounds, and smiles. </p> <p>To illustrate the importance of the pound: in the seasons after it collapsed on Black Wednesday in 1992, few foreign stars came to Britain. I suspect the chancellor, Gordon Brown, has engineered a strong currency in order to help the British game. Brown is known to be a football fan, so nutty about the game in fact that a few years ago he was considering mortgaging his house, and getting a few others to do the same, in order to buy Raith Rovers. </p> <p>Events intervened: Labour won power, and Brown now has to run Britain single-handedly. But had the Tories won the last election, then this week Raith would surely be poised to qualify for the semi-finals of the Champions League. </p> <p>The pound has taken English football this far, but the rest is up to Chelsea and Manchester United. The Champions League is a sort of jobs' fair, where the best clubs in Europe parade before potential employees. Every year, the best players from outside the elite - this year, Mario Jardel, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Sergii Rebrov - have to choose between signing for an Italian, an English or a Spanish club. Others decide whether to move from one elite team to another: Patrick Kluivert of Barcelona apparently has an offer from Chelsea. </p> <p>Wherever a great player signs, he will earn millions. So he generally chooses the club that he thinks plays the best football in the best league. </p> <p>A few years ago, this was unquestionably the Italian Serie A. But the balance has shifted. There was an Italian club in nine out of 10 European Cup finals from 1989 onwards, but there was none last year and there will probably be none this year.

      "bodyText": "This month English football has overtaken Italian football as the best in Europe. This is generally understood, but what most people have missed is why that happened, and just how crucial this week's Champions League quarter-finals will be. If Manchester United and Chelsea overcome Real Madrid and Barcelona, and if Lazio, the only Italian side left in the competition, are knocked out by Valencia - and all that seems likely - then English clubs could dominate Europe for years. It so happens that I know how English football reached this exalted point. That is because my previous job was as currency correspondent for the Financial Times , where I wrote a daily column explaining why some currencies had risen while others had fallen. Every day around noon, a few minutes after I arrived, a graphics designer named Graham would come to my desk. Graham's job was to draw the daily chart that accompanied the column, but before we could discuss that, he would talk about Chelsea. Initially, this was rather depressing. 'Furlong aaargh blah blah, Gavin Peacock blah blah, draw maybe next week blah blah,' would be a typical monologue. Gradually, it changed. 'We've signed Ed de Goey,' Graham might say, or 'We're in for Tore Andre Flo.' Later, as the stresses of his job got to him, Graham began claiming that Chelsea had bought Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly. Eventually he would ask what chart he should draw. 'Pound against the D-Mark,' I would reply. 'Did that on Tuesday,' Graham would say. 'Pound's up massively again,' I would explain. It took me a while to realise that the rise of Chelsea and the rise of sterling were two sides of the same pound coin. Over the past five years the pound has jumped almost 50 per cent against European currencies. Unfortunate as that is for British exporters, it is good news for football fans. When a British club offers \u00a310 million for an Italian-based player, the Italian club converts the sum into lira and finds it worth almost half as much again as it would have been in 1995. The foreign player produces a calculator, converts his salary into pounds, and smiles. To illustrate the importance of the pound: in the seasons after it collapsed on Black Wednesday in 1992, few foreign stars came to Britain. I suspect the chancellor, Gordon Brown, has engineered a strong currency in order to help the British game. Brown is known to be a football fan, so nutty about the game in fact that a few years ago he was considering mortgaging his house, and getting a few others to do the same, in order to buy Raith Rovers. Events intervened: Labour won power, and Brown now has to run Britain single-handedly. But had the Tories won the last election, then this week Raith would surely be poised to qualify for the semi-finals of the Champions League. The pound has taken English football this far, but the rest is up to Chelsea and Manchester United. The Champions League is a sort of jobs' fair, where the best clubs in Europe parade before potential employees. Every year, the best players from outside the elite - this year, Mario Jardel, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Sergii Rebrov - have to choose between signing for an Italian, an English or a Spanish club. Others decide whether to move from one elite team to another: Patrick Kluivert of Barcelona apparently has an offer from Chelsea. Wherever a great player signs, he will earn millions. So he generally chooses the club that he thinks plays the best football in the best league. A few years ago, this was unquestionably the Italian Serie A. But the balance has shifted. There was an Italian club in nine out of 10 European Cup finals from 1989 onwards, but there was none last year and there will probably be none this year. In the past 14 months, Chelsea and United between them have eliminated four Italian clubs. If both survive in the Champions League this week, the best players will decide that the English league is best, and will flock here. The prophecy is self-fulfiling. The more good players that come, the more English clubs will dominate Europe and more top players will come. Admittedly Italy has certain natural, non-footballing attractions, chiefly the food, the weather, and attractive city centres. But against that there is a European tradition of sympathy for English football. In a mansion somewhere on the continent, one of the greatest players of his era sits watching Premier League games on a channel he receives illegally. English football is more fun than Italian, he explains, and furthermore, he grew up on it. So did many others. Only one thing can stop English football now: a slump in sterling. A recent report says that German industrial production rose three per cent in February. The continental currencies could soon recover. If that happens, the good times should be enjoyed while they last.",

He held an emergency meeting here with the Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in one of our function rooms. The Du Maurier Festival takes place nearby every May and that draws lots of authors such as Pam Ayers and Ruth Rendell who come and stay. </p> <p><strong> Any unusual requests?</strong> <br> A guest requested haggis for breakfast which is not on our menu. We got it by sending a staff member sprinting to his aunt's house to get some, which she happened to have in the fridge. We like to be able to rise to the challenge. We have a helipad and some guests like to have the option of arriving by helicopter. </p> <p><strong> What about sightseeing?</strong> <br> The surrounding area is very much a garden county and there are some beautiful gardens. The most popular one is the Lost Gardens of Heligan. They were the gardens of a large country house that had all sorts of staff who left to fight in World War I and never returned. The place fell into disrepair and the surrounding countryside just swallowed the grounds up. A group of local businessmen have developed it and have saved as much of the original as possible. Daphne du Maurier set her novel, Jamaica Inn, in the pub of the same name which is on Bodmin Moor, a very short drive away. It's a very popular tourist destination as a result of the novel and there are very nice shops and eating places there. It's beautiful if you catch it in the sun at the right time of year. We're also very lucky to be close to some lovely fishing villages, such as Mevagissey. </p> <p><strong> What about eating out?</strong> <br> People looking for something a little less formal than our restaurant should try a real Cornish pub for a Cornish pasty, such as The Rashleigh Inn in a little village called Polkerris. It's right on the beach and has oak beams and an open fire. Rick Stein's The Seafood Restaurant is in Padstow about 20 minutes away. He can just walk out of his front door with a bucket and spade to dig up mussels and clams to take them home and cook them. </p> <p><strong> What about a night out?</strong> <br> New Quay is a very lively village about 15 or 16 miles away from us. It mostly caters for discos for the younger set,but there are Sixties and Seventies nights for slightly older guests. The Cornwall Coliseum is very near us and has a nightclub attached. </p> <p>Reservations: 01726 812 304 <br>The Seafood Restaurant: 01841 532 700 <br> The Lost Gardens of Heligan: 01726 845 100 <br>The Jamaica Inn: 01566 86250 <br>The Rashleigh Inn: 01726 813991 <br>Cornwall Coliseum: 01726 814 004 </p>",

      "bodyText": "Carylon Bay Hotel, Cornwall Tony Dormand, head concierge Any celebrity guests? Tony Blair stayed here a month ago for one night on a whistlestop tour around Cornwall. He held an emergency meeting here with the Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in one of our function rooms. The Du Maurier Festival takes place nearby every May and that draws lots of authors such as Pam Ayers and Ruth Rendell who come and stay. Any unusual requests? A guest requested haggis for breakfast which is not on our menu. We got it by sending a staff member sprinting to his aunt's house to get some, which she happened to have in the fridge. We like to be able to rise to the challenge. We have a helipad and some guests like to have the option of arriving by helicopter. What about sightseeing? The surrounding area is very much a garden county and there are some beautiful gardens. The most popular one is the Lost Gardens of Heligan. They were the gardens of a large country house that had all sorts of staff who left to fight in World War I and never returned. The place fell into disrepair and the surrounding countryside just swallowed the grounds up. A group of local businessmen have developed it and have saved as much of the original as possible. Daphne du Maurier set her novel, Jamaica Inn, in the pub of the same name which is on Bodmin Moor, a very short drive away. It's a very popular tourist destination as a result of the novel and there are very nice shops and eating places there. It's beautiful if you catch it in the sun at the right time of year. We're also very lucky to be close to some lovely fishing villages, such as Mevagissey. What about eating out? People looking for something a little less formal than our restaurant should try a real Cornish pub for a Cornish pasty, such as The Rashleigh Inn in a little village called Polkerris. It's right on the beach and has oak beams and an open fire. Rick Stein's The Seafood Restaurant is in Padstow about 20 minutes away. He can just walk out of his front door with a bucket and spade to dig up mussels and clams to take them home and cook them. What about a night out? New Quay is a very lively village about 15 or 16 miles away from us. It mostly caters for discos for the younger set,but there are Sixties and Seventies nights for slightly older guests. The Cornwall Coliseum is very near us and has a nightclub attached.

Since the ninth century, this tiny city in has been welcoming pilgrims at the end of the Camino de Santiago which runs from the French border at St Jean Pied de Port through various Spanish holy sites. This makes it Europe's oldest tourist resort. </p> <p>There is something immediately rejuvenating about the light and air of southern European as you step off the plane. In fact, this is the perfect place to spend a few days and small enough that you can get to see pretty much everything on offer in that time. </p> <p>Arriving at Santiago on a Sunday without a map or guide is not ideal, but we found that there was something about the place that meant that if you wander around aimlessly for long, you always end up at the Praza do Obrodorio, the vast central square at the centre of the city. </p> <p>There, outside Santiago de Compostela's eighteenth-century cathedral, we met Jorge, a beautifully turned out middle-aged Galician selling tapes and CDs recorded by his band of troubadours. He swept his sloppy black hat from his head in salute and gathered about him an enormous black cape festooned with multi-coloured ribbons - this was clearly the sort of living tourist attraction that could easily get on your nerves. </p> <p>But Jorge knew exactly what he was doing. Polite, with perfect English, he explained that he and his fellow musicians came from a tradition stretching back to medieval times. They played at weddings and civic occasions and to tourists of course, but mainly for the love of the troubadour's art. Most were students earning a little on the side although he himself was a pharmacist. </p> <p>'A pharmacist,' I said. 'How very interesting. But where is your band of musicians now and how do you expect me to buy your tapes if I don't know what they sound like?' </p> <p>Slightly affronted, Jorge reached deep into the folds of his cape and pulled out an ageing cassette recorder and inserted a tape. It was pleasant enough - Spanish guitars with Celtic and Arabic overtones - if you can imagine that - and a quite pleasant tenor lead. It was clearly aimed at the tourist market, but not bad all the same. </p> <p>I have never encountered such a respectful sales pitch and it set the tone for the whole stay in Santiago. 'By the way Jorge, what does the title of the cassette mean,' I said as he swept away. </p> <p>'Songs of the Pharmacist,' he said. I knew I was going to like this place. </p> <p>The Praza do Obradoiro is dominated by the vast cathedral dedicted to St James the Greater, the disciple whose remains were thought to have been discovered in Galicia in the ninth century. </p> <p>The story of James's reputed links with northern Spain are central to everything that goes on at Santiago. On the death of Jesus, the disciples are said to have wandered the world spreading his teachings and St James chose Spain for his ministry. On his return to Jerusalem, James was beheaded by the authorities, but his followers managed to seize his body and smuggle it back to Spain. Landing in Galicia, near the modern village of Padron, they carried the saint by cart inland and buried him just outside Santiago.

The Spaniards are proud of St James, especially because he later miraculously returned to help them drive out the Muslim occupying forces. He thus earned himself the name 'James the Moor-Slayer' and throughout Santiago, including the cathedral, there are gruesome images of St James as a soldier of Christ wielding a bloody sword with the dusky heads of Muslims strewn at his feet. </p> <p>Ferdinand and Isabella, the Spanish monarchs who finally drove the Moors from the Iberian peninsula, built the other great building on the Praza do Obradoiro. Since 1953, the Hotel Reis Catolicos has been a Parador, one of a chain of sumptuous state-run hotels. This is fitting for a building that was set up in the late fifteenth century as a hostel to welcome the pilgrims as they arrived in the town. Built around a series of interconnected courtyards, this has to be one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. After wandering in one evening for a drink at the bar, we decided to spend as much time here as possible. The restaurant is superb and if, just once in your life you have the chance to stay here , you must take it. </p> <p>Indeed the food in Santiago was universally good. In the tiny roads leading to the cathedral, the bars serve great tapas and the local speciality of octopus, fresh from the Atlantic.

      "body": "<p>Around Larnaca, the earth is arid and flinty, hard on the eyes, but as you travel west - quite abruptly, as if someone has flicked a switch - the landscape is suffused with green. Solitary olive trees on parched hillsides give way to grass-lapped groves. Orange thickets drip with fruit as bright as headlamps. Blue bags, tied over ripening bananas to deter birds, snap in the wind as you pass through plantations. If you stuck a Kirbigrip in the ground around here, it would grow roots and chuck out some blossoms overnight. </p> <p>Every front step and window ledge seems to be given over to the offhand cultivation of plants, and we're not just talking the ubiquitous marigolds and hot-pink geraniums that look so fetching against whitewashed Cyprus walls. No, here in old olive-oil containers on a shaded porch are freesias, a tangle of roses and flame-coloured ranunculus, a flower I've only ever seen in good florists marked \u00a35 a bunch. Arum lilies, those elegant, sepulchral trumpets beloved of upmarket hairdressers, are growing willy-nilly in a front yard where six identical black dresses are flapping on a washing line. </p> <p>Perhaps the stout, black-clad matron pegging them out knows something about the weather we don't. The sky is full of enormous clouds, moving between the hills and the sea as slowly and ominously as icebergs. April in Cyprus is officially early summer, but we won't be leaping into the surf during this visit. </p> <p>At the Anassa, a luxurious year-old resort a little along the coast from the fishing village of Latchi, at the westernmost tip of the Greek side of the island, the pale-blue shutters have broken from their catches and are slamming against the bal cony railings. The owner, an imaginative-sounding man, told his architect that every bed must have an uninterrupted view of the sea, and as my head rests on the pillow I can look out on to the navy waves. Between the beach and the hotel, the pool-side parasols are furled against the gale and splatters of rain. </p> <p>The Anassa looks like the seaside would look if it was designed by Armani. It nods at the vernacular - red roofs, white walls, even a church (air-conditioned for those mid summer rock-star weddings) - without conceding an inch on comfort or style or convenience. It is a fabulous resort for people who measure their holidays against the International Luxury Index: Frette on the bed, Molton Brown in the bathroom, Ty Nant in the minibar. At its three restaurants, you are more likely to eat red Thai curry with king prawns than anything wrapped in vine leaves. The curry is delicious, but sometimes, wandering back along the glossy cream marble floors to your room, you may forget where on earth you are. </p> <p>This is why it's a good idea to hire a car. The district of Paphos is comparatively undeveloped, at least in the context of relentlessly concreted Greek Cyprus, and in hill villages like Kathikas and Lyso, where old men while away grey afternoons with roll-ups and earthenware pots of wine, it feels as if nothing much has changed around here since Aphrodite (who was born locally and famously bathed in a now rather fetid rock pool not far from the Anassa) was a gel. Yes, there are roadside notices stating, in English, that villas called Diane and Philip and Joanne are for hire, but there are also the vivid, touching frescos at Ayios Neophytos, a church and hermitage founded by a twelfth-century saint, where monks wield feather dusters behind the iconostasis; the fishing boats tethered at Ayios Yeoryios, where traces of Neolithic, Hellenistic and Roman settlements have been found; and, high up in the Paphos forest there's the tiny hamlet of Stavros tis Psokas. </p> <p>Guidebooks urge you to go there for the Mouflon sheep - the quarry of medieval huntsmen and their trained leopards, and now the emblem of Cyprus Airways - but there's a distinct sense of anti-climax when you finally seize the wire of their enclosure and peer in at the shapes occasionally shifting in the bushes. The Mouflon plainly aren't interested in the fact that the pilgrimage to see them took you two hours on a precipitous dirt track high in the mountains. But Stavros, with its 1940s British-built canteen and picnic benches, and its family of friendly, dusty cats with green eyes, is an agreeable, cedar-scented place to have a glass of beer, even if you did forget to pack a jersey, and it must be blissfully cool and quiet in the hot months. </p> <p>The car is also useful if the relentlessly international good taste of the Anassa begins to pall, just a little. The local cooking has to be one of the great peasant cuisines of the world, and it's a mystery why it has failed where Italian has succeeded. In the town of Polis, a few kilometres away from the Anassa, in the tiny 'Old Town' restaurant, we sat down to mezze and a bottle of wine, while the draught from the windows wafted the glorious scent of a gardenia plant, plonked on a nearby shelf, in our direction. </p> <p>This is what we ate. Fresh sesame bread, dunked in roasted tomatoes and a chunky garlic and aubergine paste. A green salad, doused in olive oil and sprinkled with coriander and a handful of green olives. Pitta filled with grilled halloumi and drizzled with thyme honey. A ravioli made with feta and ham. Salmon in vine leaves. Wild asparagus in a buttery sauce made with egg yolks and lemon. Pork stuffed with feta and herbs, with a few fried potatoes. Chicken cooked with spinach, red, yellow and green peppers, and lots of olive oil. To finish, a thimbleful of the gritty local coffee, with a glass of water and a piece of almond cake soaked in honey. The whole shebang took about three hours to eat and cost eight quid a head. There are worse ways to spend a stormy evening in Cyprus. </p> <p>Harriet Lane travelled with Seasons in Style (0151 342 0505), which offers seven nights B&amp;B at the Anassa starting at \u00a31,120 per person based on two sharing a studio suite, including return flights with Cyprus Airways from London to Paphos and private transfers.

Neither the bulletin nor the Sheffield Wednesday programme made any mention whatsoever of the biggest disaster in English football. Strange, to say the least, on a day when all the games kicked off at six minutes past three. </p> <p>At least the minute's silence was perfectly observed, with the crowd maintaining a moving silence. Perhaps the best tribute of all would have been a memorable football match, but there was little chance of that with Wednesday in dire straits and Chelsea on economy setting in advance of their visit to the Nou Camp on Tuesday. </p> <p>A second successive victory for Wednesday this season has rarity value though, and, while the odds are still stacked against survival, people might now start crediting Peter Shreeves for an improvement which never looked likely. Shreeves was full of praise for the character and application Wednesday showed in picking up only their sixth win of the season at Wimbledon in midweek, but supporters did not appear to share the acting manager's optimism that the 2-0 victory might prove a turning point. Vendors of War of the Monster Trucks, the Wednesday fanzine, were attempting to drum up trade before kick-off by cheerily advertising a Relegation Special. </p> <p>That was about as cheery as the afternoon got until the 50th minute, when Ed de Goey enlivened the proceedings considerably by bringing down Gilles de Bilde to concede the penalty from which Wim Jonk gave Wednesday the lead. Nothing of note occurred in the first half, save for de Bilde hitting the side netting and Wednesday pointlessly constructing a shooting chance which fell to Andy Hinchcliffe on his right foot, but the home side surprised everyone with a goal just after the interval which opened up the second half. </p> <p>De Bilde, to be fair, spent the afternoon trying to spring Chelsea's offside trap, though he saw the flag so often one would not have put money on him ever succeeding. When Andy Booth's through ball put him in a foot race with former Wednesday defender Emerson Thome, however, there was only going to be one winner. De Bilde's turn of speed and spritely turn left the Brazilian on the floor, and when he rounded the goalkeeper for good measure only an illicit ankle tap from De Goey prevented him slipping the ball into an empty net. Wednesday fans were rightly incensed that the Chelsea keeper received only a yellow card instead of the mandatory red for a professional foul - Thome could have brought De Bilde down without conceding a penalty, but was discouraged by the knowledge that as last man a foul would mean certain dismissal. </p> <p>Five minutes after taking the lead Booth had a chance to make the game safe, but could not get enough power into his header from Peter Atherton's cross and De Goey saved on the line. The George Weah show then followed, or at least a cameo of the Liberian's talents, as he hit first Kevin Pressman's post and then his crossbar in the space of two minutes. Pressman knew nothing about the first, a snapshot from Chris Sutton's knockdown on the edge of the area which he was relieved to see bounce back into play, but he invited the second by unwisely attempting to dribble out of trouble in his penalty area. Weah simply took the ball off him, turned and shot from memory before Pressman could retreat to his line. In the circumstances, hitting the bar was not bad, but had Weah taken his time he might have made sure. </p> <p>Tore Andre Flo joined the attack for the final 20 minutes, but though Gustavo Poyet forced a good save from Pressman, Chelsea were well beaten in the end and did not take it well. Sutton was lucky not to join Marcel Desailly in the referee's book for berating a linesman, and Poyet appeared to be cautioned after the final whistle as a group of Chelsea players surrounded Durkin. The real Chelsea will be back on Tuesday, while the new Sheffield Wednesday have home games against Sunderland and Leeds in which to show their revival is no illusion.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I went to Hawaii this year entirely by mistake. I said I wanted to interview Paul Theroux, and next thing I knew the office was phoning me about flights to Honolulu. How was I to know he lived in Hawaii? I thought he lived on Cape Cod. And whereas most journalists - nay, most people - would probably leap and gambol and clap their hands and cry hoorah at the thought of a winter break in Hawaii, it just so happens that I had been to Hawaii once before. </p> <p>It was to cover the Gotcha Pro Surfing Championship in 1987, when surfing was briefly supposed to be the new Wimbledon or the new Formula 1. I forget why. What it meant was that every surfer came with at least two businessmen attached, who insisted that you talk about 'the product' or the logo before you could interview their boy. And boy, were their boys disappointing! I'd imagined them, from Beach Boys songs, as carefree dropouts who were either surfing or stoned. This lot were as fretful and uptight as bankers, endlessly discussing their Feccs - fast energy complex carbohydrates - and worrying about the occupational hazards of surfer's ear and lower back pain. Many of them were born-again Christians, who told me that Christ was the first surfer: 'He walked on water but He didn't need a board.' </p> <p>Moreover, 1987 was the year they decided to hold the surfing championships on Sandy Beach, near Waikiki, instead of on one of the famous surfing beaches on the North Shore. It was a horrible, dull cove full of choppy waves, not the great pipelines Hawaii is famous for, though apparently bad waves are a better test of surfing skill. (That is why professional surfers are surprisingly respectful of the British championships at Newquay.) Anyway, I got thoroughly fed up and the one day I tried to escape from Sandy Beach, I crashed the car within five minutes and have never dared drive an automatic again. </p> <p>So that was my first experience of Hawaii. (Incidentally, it's now supposed to be spelled Hawai'i but nobody out there seems to have noticed.) I thought I'd try harder to enjoy it this time, but it does have certain insuperable disadvantages, viz: </p> <p><strong> 1 </strong> It is an incredibly long way away: an 11-hour flight to Los Angeles, two or three hours getting lost in LA, another five hours to Honolulu. (Incidentally, note to smokers: Gate 68 is the magic number; it has a smokers' cage on the roof.) So, l8 hours minimum - in which time you could practically fly to Australia. And you should fly to Australia because: </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Hawaii is monumentally boring. Oh it's pretty, I suppose, with its wonderful rainbows, mountainous hinterland and fabulous surfing beaches, but it's also very built-up and suburban, with a motorway as sticky as the M25. I'm talking about the main island, Oahu, where 80 per cent of the population lives. Apparently, the other islands are much emptier. Waikiki, the beach area of the capital, Honolulu, is one of the most densely populated places on earth, with at least l00,000 people packed into one-seventh of a square mile. About half the tourists are American and the other half Japanese, and they all pile into buses to visit Pearl Harbor together. Very rum. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Hawaii is, of course, part of the United States - the locals get upset if you say you're going to the States - but noticeably more expensive because everything has to be flown in. They call this, cynically, the 'paradise tax'. (Almost everything in Hawaii comes with the word Paradise attached, and/or the word Aloha , which means hello or welcome or something. In shops, it becomes almost as irritating as, 'Have a nice day.') Anyway, the combination of American and Hawaiian influence produces gastronomic disaster. All meals, whatever you order, consist of a fishburger served in a basket with tasteless chips. Hawaiians are very proud of their fish and disguise them with so many different names it's impossible to avoid them all, but there is one they're particularly keen on called mahi-mahi , which tastes like old cod. Oh yes, and they seriously expect you to drink mai tai, which is basically rum with gloop. Just say no. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Sightseeing tours of Hawaii assume a fascination with Hawaii Five-O, Magnum and Tom Selleck which I frankly don't share. We spent a lot of time gawping at houses where Selleck once lived, and visiting places where various Hawaii Five-O scenes were shot. The tour guide lost me at the outset when she said: 'Oh you're English - did you bring Hyacinth with you?' Apparently, there is a television character called Hyacinth Bucket though I have no idea which part she plays in Hawaii Five-O . An alternative sightseeing tour features a visit to the pineapple plantations. Would you drive 40 miles to see a field of cabbages? Right. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Or you can visit Hawaiian sacred sites. I only saw one, but was reliably informed by Theroux that it is the Westminster Abbey of Hawaii, so presumably this is as good as it gets. It is called Pu'u O Mohuka Heiau ( heiau means a temple), and is believed to have been built in the eighteenth century. But it has since fallen down and consists of a heap of blackened stones. However, it has a lovely view of Weimea Bay, which is something you can't say about Westminster Abbey. </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> Hawaiian 'music' - fat girls in hula skirts, warbling to fat men with ukeleles. Enough said. </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> The common clich\u00e9 about Hawaii is that it has lots of geography and no history. Actually it does have history - the usual tale of a once flourishing culture clobbered to death by missionaries - but you can learn about it much more easily in Britain, where we have books, than in Hawaii. Hawaii remains essentially a pre-literate society. The only reading matter is to be found on T-shirts and usually consists of the word Aloha, though once in a while you find a whole sentence, namely, 'I went to Hawaii and got lei-ed.' Buy all your guidebooks before you go - if you must go. There is a surprisingly wide range of them in Waterstone's. </p> <p>So, despite all that, is there any good reason why you should go to Hawaii? Well yes, if you are a surfer you have to go because it is the place where surfing was invented and has the best surfing beaches in the world. If you are a keen canoeist you should go, because it offers everything from sea kayaking to outrigger canoeing, and Honolulu has the only airport in the world to feature a statue of a canoeist. If you are an astronomer you will dream of visiting the observatory on the big island, which has four of the best telescopes in the world. And if, like me, you are a collector of kitsch you will thrill to the souvenir shops of Waikiki which offer such Jeff Koonsian treats as a snowstorm containing Father Christmas in a hula skirt. </p> <p>Oh yes, and Hawaii also has fabulous rainbows and a generally delightful climate, and on my last day I discovered the International Market where you can eat Japanese, Korean, Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese, and avoid the dreaded mahi-mahi burger. That's all folks, but I'll give the last word to Rupert Brooke, who wrote in Waikiki: </p> <p>And dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me, <br> Gleam like a woman's hair, stretch out, and rise; <br> And new stars burn into the ancient skies, <br>Over the murmurous soft Hawaiian sea. </p> <p>Sounds irresistible, doesn't it? Go if you must. </p> <p><strong> Hawai facts </strong> </p> <p>The fiftieth US state comprises more than 100 islands of which the six major ones are (from north to south) Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui and Hawaii with a total population of about 1.2 million. </p> <p><strong> Currency</strong> US dollars: \u00a31 buys $1.58. </p> <p><strong> Visas</strong> Britons do not need them. </p> <p><strong> Climate</strong> Temperatures hover around 31C all year round while water temperatures range from 24 to 28 degrees. Rainfall is heaviest in the mountainous, rainforested interiors.On the North Shore the surf is high between November and March. </p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong> The Hawaiian Dream (020 8470 1181) has return fares to either Honolulu or Maui from \u00a3444 with United Airlines via Los Angeles or San Francisco. Air New Zealand (020 8741 2299) has four flights a week to Honolulu via Los Angeles from \u00a3497. </p> <p><strong> Getting around</strong> Oahu has a efficient transport system known as 'The Bus' - each ride costs $1;otherwise car hire is advisable. </p> <p><strong> Attractions</strong> Oahu: Hana'uma Bay National Fisheries and Wildlife Preserve; Polynesian Cultural Centre; Sea Life Park. Kauai: Waimea Canyon; Na Pali Cliffs.

Waikiki, the beach area of the capital, Honolulu, is one of the most densely populated places on earth, with at least l00,000 people packed into one-seventh of a square mile. About half the tourists are American and the other half Japanese, and they all pile into buses to visit Pearl Harbor together. Very rum. 3 Hawaii is, of course, part of the United States - the locals get upset if you say you're going to the States - but noticeably more expensive because everything has to be flown in. They call this, cynically, the 'paradise tax'. (Almost everything in Hawaii comes with the word Paradise attached, and/or the word Aloha , which means hello or welcome or something. In shops, it becomes almost as irritating as, 'Have a nice day.') Anyway, the combination of American and Hawaiian influence produces gastronomic disaster. All meals, whatever you order, consist of a fishburger served in a basket with tasteless chips. Hawaiians are very proud of their fish and disguise them with so many different names it's impossible to avoid them all, but there is one they're particularly keen on called mahi-mahi , which tastes like old cod. Oh yes, and they seriously expect you to drink mai tai, which is basically rum with gloop. Just say no. 4 Sightseeing tours of Hawaii assume a fascination with Hawaii Five-O, Magnum and Tom Selleck which I frankly don't share. We spent a lot of time gawping at houses where Selleck once lived, and visiting places where various Hawaii Five-O scenes were shot. The tour guide lost me at the outset when she said: 'Oh you're English - did you bring Hyacinth with you?' Apparently, there is a television character called Hyacinth Bucket though I have no idea which part she plays in Hawaii Five-O . An alternative sightseeing tour features a visit to the pineapple plantations. Would you drive 40 miles to see a field of cabbages? Right. 5 Or you can visit Hawaiian sacred sites. I only saw one, but was reliably informed by Theroux that it is the Westminster Abbey of Hawaii, so presumably this is as good as it gets. It is called Pu'u O Mohuka Heiau ( heiau means a temple), and is believed to have been built in the eighteenth century. But it has since fallen down and consists of a heap of blackened stones. However, it has a lovely view of Weimea Bay, which is something you can't say about Westminster Abbey. 6 Hawaiian 'music' - fat girls in hula skirts, warbling to fat men with ukeleles. Enough said. 7 The common clich\u00e9 about Hawaii is that it has lots of geography and no history. Actually it does have history - the usual tale of a once flourishing culture clobbered to death by missionaries - but you can learn about it much more easily in Britain, where we have books, than in Hawaii. Hawaii remains essentially a pre-literate society. The only reading matter is to be found on T-shirts and usually consists of the word Aloha, though once in a while you find a whole sentence, namely, 'I went to Hawaii and got lei-ed.' Buy all your guidebooks before you go - if you must go. There is a surprisingly wide range of them in Waterstone's. So, despite all that, is there any good reason why you should go to Hawaii? Well yes, if you are a surfer you have to go because it is the place where surfing was invented and has the best surfing beaches in the world. If you are a keen canoeist you should go, because it offers everything from sea kayaking to outrigger canoeing, and Honolulu has the only airport in the world to feature a statue of a canoeist. If you are an astronomer you will dream of visiting the observatory on the big island, which has four of the best telescopes in the world. And if, like me, you are a collector of kitsch you will thrill to the souvenir shops of Waikiki which offer such Jeff Koonsian treats as a snowstorm containing Father Christmas in a hula skirt. Oh yes, and Hawaii also has fabulous rainbows and a generally delightful climate, and on my last day I discovered the International Market where you can eat Japanese, Korean, Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese, and avoid the dreaded mahi-mahi burger. That's all folks, but I'll give the last word to Rupert Brooke, who wrote in Waikiki: And dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me, Gleam like a woman's hair, stretch out, and rise; And new stars burn into the ancient skies, Over the murmurous soft Hawaiian sea. Sounds irresistible, doesn't it? Go if you must. Hawai facts The fiftieth US state comprises more than 100 islands of which the six major ones are (from north to south) Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui and Hawaii with a total population of about 1.2 million.

The film suggests that the victims were satisfied with the outcome.</p> <p>Not so. Many now say the film misrepresents what happened and the true story is far less than the populist victory shown on screen.</p> <p>'The movie is mostly lies,' says Carol Smith, one of those depicted in the film. 'I wish the truth would come out, because a lot of us are upset. I understand that the movie is going to make Erin Brockovich and the attorneys out to be heroes. But where's our money?'</p> <p>Since the case never went to trial and was settled behind closed doors before a panel of arbitrators, neither transcripts of the proceeds nor records of how the settlement was disbursed have ever been made available to the public, or even the victims themselves.</p> <p>A number of beneficiaries to the settlement are now preparing to sue their lawyers, including Brockovich's firm, Masry &amp; Vititoe.They are complaining that their awards were smaller than they deserved, that their lawyers kept their money for six months after the settlement was made without paying the interest, and that there was little or no apparent logic behind the varying amounts of money that they received.</p> <p>Moreover, they say some of their lawyers took some of the judges in the case on a Mediterranean luxury cruise, a potential conflict of interest.</p> <p>Many residents who suffer from the debilitating effects of chromium poisoning, ranging from nosebleeds to cancer, are unable to reconcile the enormous pay-out with the paltry cheques they received.</p> <p>Under their agreement with with Ed Masry (who is played in the film by Albert Finney) and two other law firms, the lawyers received 40 per cent of the settlement, or $133m. That should have left $196m for the victims, or roughly $300,000 each.</p> <p>But many have received $100,000 or less, and neither PG&amp;E nor the lawyers will release records of their accounting. Carol Smith's husband, who had 17 tumours removed from his throat, received only $80,000. An elderly resident in the town was awarded $25,000.</p> <p>Ron Gonzales, who grew up next to the plant and suffers skin problems, says that he initially received only $100,000, a sum that was doubled after he complained to Masry. His sister, who had most of her cancerous lower intestine removed, received about $2m. Gonzales charges that Masry and Brockovich advised residents not to appeal against their pay-outs.</p> <p>'Masry and Brockovich got greedy,' he said. 'They could have settled for less and given the money to the people that deserved the money. Masry is portraying himself as such a big hero. He and Erin are claiming to be saviours, but Erin got more than my sister did. And my sister's sick.' Contacted by Salon magazine, Brockovich herself did not seem to understand the process of private arbitration or the fact that the records of the case remain secret.</p> <p>Her former employer, Masry, was unable to explain the process either. 'Why are you being stupid?' he retorted. 'It was a complicated $333m settlement. Are you an idiot?'</p> <p>One of the most damaging allegations against Masry and the other lawyers concerns the settlement to the town's 100 children. In California, lawyers are usually only allowed to take 25 per cent of any pay-out to minors. But the judges in the case allowed the lawyers to take one-third.</p> <p>Moreover, the clients were billed an extra $10m for expenses that were never detailed, although some suspect Brockovich was paid out of this money.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Masry settled a second suit against Betz, the makers of the poisonous chromate, for about $75m. As soon as that money is dispersed, Masry's firm may be sued by a Bakersfield lawyer named Mike Dolan over the issues of the minors' fees and the expenses. Dolan has calculated that the average pay-out to the 81 townsfolk he has spoken to is $151,000.</p> <p>He plans to demand release of the lawyers' accounts on behalf of his clients. 'They threatened to drop anyone from the Betz litigation if they went with me,' said Dolan. 'But as soon as my clients get their cheques, I am going to sue them.</p> <p>'They had absolutely no right to take a third of the kids' money, and I want full disclosure of how the expenses were calculated and how the entire amount was dispersed.'</p> <p>But in a small town where the sudden influx of money has caused ruptures, attitudes are divided.</p> <p>For different reasons, many now regret allowing the case to be settled by arbitration rather than in a court of law. Roberta Walker, who suffers from a number of chromium-related conditions, is one who wishes it had gone to court. 'PG&amp;E ripped us off,' she said. 'They're the villains here. The lawyers just took what every lawyer would take. I wanted carte blanche on medical expenses, and I didn't get that.'</p> <p>Lynn Tindell, who got $50,000, also said she wished the case had been settled in public.

First, Gone in Sixty Seconds, an action heist movie starring Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Vinnie Jones and plenty of fast cars, and then The Gift, a Keanu Reeves thriller. So the former child star is doing rather well. Like Seth, he is a player with a big future - as long as he keeps his head and doesn't upset his employers.",

If anyone could take the strange premise of Human Nature and put it on screen it was him. </p> <p>Marisa Tomei committed herself to the film; Frasier star David Hyde-Pierce was interested. Soderbergh proved his commitment by turning down the more obviously commercial Out Of Sight , which had George Clooney attached to it. </p> <p>Kaufman was about to achieve the impossible: emerge from nowhere and have his bizarre vision turned, intact, into a medium-sized film. This wasn't supposed to happen, not for a writer - always considered Hollywood's most despised citizens. </p> <p>And it didn't happen. Soderbergh ended up making Out Of Sight after all, and saved his career. Human Nature got booted around between studios. All was as it should be. </p> <p>Except that three years later Kaufman has a Bafta for his other script, the no less strange Being John Malkovich , while Human Nature will now star Patricia Arquette and a third Kaufman script, Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind , looks like emerging from development hell. </p> <p>'Being John Malkovich wouldn't have existed without Charlie Kaufman,' admitted Columbia Pictures chairwoman Amy Pascal. Now that might seem crushingly obvious to you: since the idea was entirely Kaufman's, and the words were Kaufman's, then of course the film couldn't have happened without Kaufman. But for a studio executive to concede that writers have their uses, well, that's news. </p> <p>So are writers finally getting their dues? It seems like it, not least financially. The list of writers edging into the million dollar per movie bracket gets longer by the week. And it's not just the cash: they are getting noticed. In the great American Beauty publicity bonanza, Alan Ball certainly hasn't been forgotten. Wonder kids Adam Herz ( American Pie ) and Ehren Kruger ( Arlington Road, Scream 3, Reindeer Games ), both 27, have Hollywood at their feet. Herz has been given $2 million to write and direct a film. Kruger is furiously busy, despite the limited success of the films he wrote from scratch. Then there's Susannah Grant who, after Erin Brockavich - directed by Steven Soderbergh, incidentally - and the Sandra Bullock vehicle, 28 Days, is challenging the Ephron sisters' monopoly on the 'funny, female, bankable writer' market. </p> <p>Soon one of Hollywood's oldest jokes, about the starlet so dumb she tried to advance her career by sleeping with a writer, will be obsolete. </p> <p>Well, maybe. It's worth questioning this story of writers' lowly status. How do we know that scriptwriters are badly paid, abused, bullied, and their work taken for granted? Because they tell us so. 'Beating up on writers is a Hollywood blood sport,' according to John Gregory Dunne in his recent book Monster: Living Off The Big Screen . </p> <p>Dunne's book - about how he and wife Joan Didion spent eight years writing the utterly forgettable Michele Pfeiffer-Robert Redford film Up Close And Personal - is part of a fast-growing literary subgenre. For a supposedly powerless figure, the writer's mastery of language means they can always have the last word. </p> <p>Which brings us to the enduring image of Hollywood's attitude towards writers: America's greatest novelists, playwrights and wits left to drink themselves to oblivion while the culturally barren studio bosses got some hack or other to take the fancy words out. Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Chandler and Dorothy Parker - all shafted by the studios. </p> <p>In this version of events, the problem starts with the writers' late arrival in Hollywood. After all, until 1927 they weren't necessary. With the dawn of the talkies, writers were shipped in from the East Coast and for the studios they were an extra unwanted expense. </p> <p>The writers, on the other hand, brought prickly egos and a lack of experience at being mere cogs in the machine. Ironically, one result was that in Hollywood, writers - normally solitary people - became heavily unionised. The Writers Guild Of America (West) has even managed a number of solidly maintained strikes, including one in 1988 that ran for five months. Impressive for a union with various millionaire members. </p> <p>And - in what some claim is no coincidence - a disproportionately high number of writers were victims of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. </p> <p> Yet there is a problem with the idea of the much abused screenwriter. Let's start with the supposedly underpaid nature of screenwriting. Here's the more-honest-than-most William Goldman: 'For the hardcover publication of my first novel I was paid $5,000. Such was the glory of its reception that, for my second novel, I was paid $2,500. For Harper, my first Hollywood film, I received $80,000.' </p> <p>Put simply, scriptwriting is far more lucrative than any other method of earning a living with words. And while journalists and novelists get fully paid only for work that makes it into print, plenty of screenwriters are able to survive on development deals alone. </p> <p>Then there is the question of having your work messed about with. It's true that scarcely any film makes it to the screen as originally written by the writer. But that's because film-making is a collaborative process. In fact, most writing - this article included - is a collaborative process. Modern novels suffer precisely because you often do get the words straight from the writer's word processor. </p> <p>And although most scriptwriters have had the upsetting experience of having a cherished script taken away from them, few have ever turned down the opportunity to rewrite someone else's pet movie. </p> <p>Writers with genuine voices of their own, such as Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, always seem happy enough to contribute anonymous script polishes to Jerry Bruckheimer blockbusters. </p> <p>And as for that lowly status, did you hear the one about the dumb blond starlet who slept with the cinematographer to get ahead? In Hollywood only actors, producers and (sometimes) directors count. Everyone else is just there to do their job. It's just that writers have a loftier view of themselves. Nevertheless it can only be a good thing when people like Charlie Kaufman, or Election writer-director Alexander Payne, or the Rushmore team of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, are getting attention. All have genuinely startling ideas, the kind that can't be cobbled together by committee. </p> <p>If Hollywood wants more films like Being John Malkovich and fewer sequels, no one is going to complain. </p> <p>On the other hand, the rise of Susannah Grant is probably more interesting to industry insiders trying to track the successor to women-friendly script machine Ronald Bass - if the dismal 28 Days is anything to go by. </p> <p>But don't get too carried away by the idea of writers taking over the town. They have their own Icarus to remind them of the perils of too much expectation. It was only a couple of years ago that Kevin Williamson established himself as that rarest of beasts, the genuine star writer. </p> <p>Scream director Wes Craven was furious when I Know What You Did Last Summer was tagged as being by 'the creator of Scream ', but no one else could see the problem.

      "body": "<p>Ever felt you've been had? You might if you've already been seduced into a cinema to watch Brian De Palma's Mission To Mars, which opened on Friday. Just consider yourself a victim of a movie industry strategy known as 'hit-and-run' - one of the cynical, risky but often effective dark arts that marketing departments employ to flog films they know to be well below par. </p> <p>The strategy is simple. In the weeks before release the film is kept tightly under wraps. There are fewer press screenings than normal and these are scheduled to be near or beyond magazine deadlines. Handy screening rooms in the centre of London are eschewed in favour of obscure sites and screenings tend to be scheduled not at the office-friendly 6.30pm but at 9pm. </p> <p>Then, the week before release, a huge advertising campaign will hit TV, radio and billboards before the movie opens simultaneously on thousands of screens, presented - with little or no critical context and zero word-of-mouth - as a must-see blockbuster. Attendance will peak on the Saturday night before cinemas work out that they've got a dud. And a week later, it will be gone.</p> <p>Mission To Mars has already pulled off the trick in America, where it was released last month. In its first weekend it made $23.1 million, an impressive performance by any standards. By week two, as poisonous word-of-mouth spread, the take fell by a gigantic 52 per cent to $10.9m. Two weeks later its slide down the chart had transformed into a plummet with a paltry $6.4m. But that huge opening weekend meant that by the time the film slinks off the screen the studio will no doubt have recouped its investment and will possibly make a small profit. </p> <p>'The idea is to make as much noise as you can, get in with a fair number of prints and then get out,' says Charles McDonald of independent publicity company McDonald &amp; Rutter. But this can backfire dreadfully. 'If you limit press screenings it becomes obvious that there's a problem. You can make films more or less difficult to see, but unless you want to turn the whole thing into an issue - \"the movie the critics hated but you'll love!\" - you're always better to show it.' </p> <p>There is also the question of financial risk. Pulling off a hit-and-run release requires the manufacture of a large number of prints (costly items at up to \u00a3900 a time) as well as investment in an intensive and unavoidable advertising campaign. 'The whole thing can rebound in a terrible way,' says McDonald. ' The Avengers demonstrated how you can really screw things up.' Indeed the 1998 adaptation of the cult TV series was a Waterloo for the hit-and-run release. The film, rumoured to be in trouble throughout its production, was scheduled for simultaneous worldwide release (in order to avoid Internet gossip) and the producers issued a memo declaring, much to the entertainment press's mirth, that 'the press and the public would be allowed to discover The Avengers together'. In other words there would be no press screenings. </p> <p>And the result? The story effortlessly migrated from dismal reviews on page 36 to front page 'What a Flop!' news pieces. The delighted Sun went so far as to dispatch a hack dressed as a turkey to a London cinema. </p> <p>So the film was never judged on its merits or lack of them but was instead held up as an example of the archetypal Hollywood disaster. In fact, it wasn't - it was just averagely poor. </p> <p>'There you had a screw-up because, arguably, the bulk of the potential audience for The Avengers was not film buffs at all but simply people who had vaguely fond memories of the TV series,' says McDonald. 'But after it had been held up to ridicule there was no way they could be seen to go and see it.' </p> <p>But as movie budgets continue to rise, the hit-and-run is likely to remain. 'I doubt anyone outside the industry could spot a hit-and-run release if it's done properly,' says one senior PR who has structured such campaigns. 'If it's such a big film that you're going to release it anyway, your trailer will have been in cinemas for six months, and with an action movie you can cut a fantastic trailer out of nothing. </p> <p>'So your punter awareness will have been building without them having any information about it.' </p> <p>Mission to Mars opened on Friday.

      "bodyText": "Ever felt you've been had? You might if you've already been seduced into a cinema to watch Brian De Palma's Mission To Mars, which opened on Friday. Just consider yourself a victim of a movie industry strategy known as 'hit-and-run' - one of the cynical, risky but often effective dark arts that marketing departments employ to flog films they know to be well below par. The strategy is simple. In the weeks before release the film is kept tightly under wraps. There are fewer press screenings than normal and these are scheduled to be near or beyond magazine deadlines. Handy screening rooms in the centre of London are eschewed in favour of obscure sites and screenings tend to be scheduled not at the office-friendly 6.30pm but at 9pm. Then, the week before release, a huge advertising campaign will hit TV, radio and billboards before the movie opens simultaneously on thousands of screens, presented - with little or no critical context and zero word-of-mouth - as a must-see blockbuster. Attendance will peak on the Saturday night before cinemas work out that they've got a dud. And a week later, it will be gone. Mission To Mars has already pulled off the trick in America, where it was released last month. In its first weekend it made $23.1 million, an impressive performance by any standards. By week two, as poisonous word-of-mouth spread, the take fell by a gigantic 52 per cent to $10.9m. Two weeks later its slide down the chart had transformed into a plummet with a paltry $6.4m. But that huge opening weekend meant that by the time the film slinks off the screen the studio will no doubt have recouped its investment and will possibly make a small profit. 'The idea is to make as much noise as you can, get in with a fair number of prints and then get out,' says Charles McDonald of independent publicity company McDonald &amp; Rutter. But this can backfire dreadfully. 'If you limit press screenings it becomes obvious that there's a problem. You can make films more or less difficult to see, but unless you want to turn the whole thing into an issue - \"the movie the critics hated but you'll love!\" - you're always better to show it.' There is also the question of financial risk. Pulling off a hit-and-run release requires the manufacture of a large number of prints (costly items at up to \u00a3900 a time) as well as investment in an intensive and unavoidable advertising campaign. 'The whole thing can rebound in a terrible way,' says McDonald. ' The Avengers demonstrated how you can really screw things up.' Indeed the 1998 adaptation of the cult TV series was a Waterloo for the hit-and-run release. The film, rumoured to be in trouble throughout its production, was scheduled for simultaneous worldwide release (in order to avoid Internet gossip) and the producers issued a memo declaring, much to the entertainment press's mirth, that 'the press and the public would be allowed to discover The Avengers together'. In other words there would be no press screenings. And the result? The story effortlessly migrated from dismal reviews on page 36 to front page 'What a Flop!' news pieces. The delighted Sun went so far as to dispatch a hack dressed as a turkey to a London cinema. So the film was never judged on its merits or lack of them but was instead held up as an example of the archetypal Hollywood disaster. In fact, it wasn't - it was just averagely poor. 'There you had a screw-up because, arguably, the bulk of the potential audience for The Avengers was not film buffs at all but simply people who had vaguely fond memories of the TV series,' says McDonald. 'But after it had been held up to ridicule there was no way they could be seen to go and see it.' But as movie budgets continue to rise, the hit-and-run is likely to remain. 'I doubt anyone outside the industry could spot a hit-and-run release if it's done properly,' says one senior PR who has structured such campaigns. 'If it's such a big film that you're going to release it anyway, your trailer will have been in cinemas for six months, and with an action movie you can cut a fantastic trailer out of nothing. 'So your punter awareness will have been building without them having any information about it.' Mission to Mars opened on Friday. Read Philip French's verdict in The Review section",

'She is repenting, of course, but the attitude that she is a cold-blooded murderer is wrong. Who knows what this poor girl has been through? Who knows why she didn't abort?</p> <p>'There were marks, signs of bites and bruises over her body, her intimate parts. We want to protect her; we will try to get her a new lawyer.'</p> <p>This is what Ahmeti does: she speaks for the estimated 20,000 women now carrying Kosovo's dark secret. The innumerable women who were raped, and impregnated, abandoned by family and friends. The women outcasts violated, tortured and left for dead; the 'touched' women, who have now heaped shame on the houses of their husbands. The women who see the war every day, in their minds, in their bodies, through their rape-babies.</p> <p>It is Friday morning and there are snowflakes splattering the window panes of the Centre for Protection of Women and Children which Ahmeti set up in 1993. Women trudge up the hill on which the centre stands, daintily side-stepping the litter and carrion birds that defile so much of the province.</p> <p>Sometimes, when they are feeling strong, they step inside. Sometimes, if Ahmeti is lucky, a woman will even tell her story. So far, 76 women, mostly young and beautiful, the daughters of eminent Kosovars and village elders (women targeted by the Serbs) have been mus tered enough courage to enter the centre.</p> <p>For everyone who had come there, Ahmeti said you could count at least a hundred more. They are just the tip of the iceberg; the very few who have managed to break the 'metallic silence' that surrounds the issue of being 'touched'.</p> <p>For rape is not a word that Kosovar women ever use. This is not Bosnia; there is no cosmopolitan Sarajevo. There is only provincial Pristina. In the villages and hamlets, where the Yugoslav police, military and Serb paramilitaries evidently ran amok, rape has yet to enter their ancient lexicon.</p> <p>'These are simple women, women who have been degraded, disgraced, and will carry this trauma like a bullet for the rest of their lives,' Ahmeti murmurs, chain-smoking. 'Raped women all over the world find it hard to speak, here they can hardly do it at all.</p> <p>'They rarely tell each other... we've had cases of suicide, the lunacy of women losing all access to their children if it gets out.'</p> <p>Mirveta, the pretty infanticidal mother, is no exception. She is typical of the selection process pursued by the perpetrators, according to a Human Rights Watch report released last month.</p> <p>As they tried to ethnically cleanse Kosovo, paramilitaries - often aided by masked Serb neighbours - systematically searched villages for girls of prime, child-bearing age.</p> <p>It was about power and control, humiliation and revenge. And what better way to damage the enemy's morale than to hit at his family? 'Our society is a traditional one where Albanian men are brought up to see themselves as breadwinners and protectors,' Ahmeti points out.</p> <p>'Once you touch the woman, you touch the honour of the family and you provoke the man to react. The Serbs knew this. Belgrade had, for years, put out propaganda that the only thing Albanian women could do was produce like mice. So daughters were gang-raped in front of their fathers, wives in front of their husbands, nieces in front of their uncles, mothers in front of their children, just to dehumanise, just to degrade.'</p> <p>It is estimated by the World Health Organisation and the US-based Centre for Disease Control that as many as 20,000 Kosovar women (4.4 per cent of the population) were raped in the two years prior to Nato's forces entering the benighted territory. Numbers to match Bosnia, if not more.</p> <p>But unlike Bosnia, where international organisations were located throughout the war, the province was on its own. If, as Human Rights Watch argues, politicians did not exploit the fate of the women (which would have been a way of drumming up support for the Nato bombing campaign), aid organisations also played it down.</p> <p>'I think there was a deliberate policy to keep it quiet. We knew, in such a patriarchal society, where the perception of rape is so medieval, that it would probably cause a lot of social distress,' said Gamilla Backman, an adviser on violence prevention at the World Health Organisation. 'Making revelations just to shake mentalities might have had the opposite effect and made life even more difficult for victims brave enough to speak.</p> <p>'The international community has got cynical about rape. Time has shown, with the women of Bosnia, how very little talking can achieve.'</p> <p>By the time the province was liberated, hundreds of women who had been plucked from columns of refugees as they tried to flee the Serb onslaught were discovered wandering the hills, often disoriented, drugged, half-naked and half-crazed.</p> <p>'There was always so much focus on the refugees who managed to get out and so little on the people who stayed inside - the 700,000 of them who suffered the real trauma,' said Ahmeti.</p> <p>How many of these women then found themselves pregnant will remain a mystery. How many gave birth is almost impossible to determine because of taboo.</p> <p>Local humanitarian groups, including the Red Cross, have estimated that 100 rape-babies were born in January alone. Innumerable others almost certainly came into the world on bathroom floors and kitchen tables, behind the high-walled homes of family clans who have vowed never to speak.</p> <p>'Only God knows,' said Professor Skender Boshnjaku, Kosovo's leading neuropsychiatrist, who specialises in women's illness, 'how many have been born in secret. I know of children who are being brought up by their grandmothers, women who want to protect their daughters. These babies will know a lot of hate, they will not have a lot of love.'</p> <p>The issue of babies 'born of violence' is not a subject Kosovars find easy to address. Boshnjaku concentrates on his shoes when the conversation veers in the direction of the rape-babies. Did he think I would be able to talk to some of the victims?</p> <p>No, he said flatly. Albanian women did not talk about themselves. They did not talk about their feelings. They used language economically, usually to convey the essentials of their primitive lives. They were 'the property of men, to be bought, sold and betrothed before birth'. They are 'sacks to be filled,' he says, citing the Kanun, the medieval war-and-peace code of behaviour still adhered to in these parts.</p> <p>'Ours was a society built on generations of hate. There are older Albanians who speak Serbian, but generally there was very little interaction between our people and the Serbs. And now,' he said, waving his hands desperately, 'there are these babies.'</p> <p>Even Ahmeti, who hails from a family of open-minded, well-travelled intellectuals, finds the phenomenon of Albanian-Serb progeny un-comfortable. Some women will accept them, some will nurture them begrudgingly, some will reject them. But, she said, they will not be dumped in orphanages and they will not be left in baskets and boxes on the streets.</p> <p>'They are innocent children, they are not to blame,' she said. 'People, here, will take them into their homes and married women will be able to cover up. Our hope is that they grow up without the guilt of their mothers.' The local authorities are about to start a television campaign appealing for prospective parents. 'It concerns me greatly that some are calling them \"children of shame\".'</p> <p>But rape, I am told on my first night in Pristina, is worse than death. To be an Albanian who gives birth to a child sired by a Serb is to be sentenced to a living hell.</p> <p>Pedric, who told me this, is young and worldly. 'If I were normal, I would keep the kid, accept my wife. But in Kosovo, in our culture, death is better than rape. I could not accept my wife. She would be dirty, evil, the castle of the enemy,' he booms. 'A lot of women have been very sensible. They have kept quiet about it, they have given birth at home and, if they are even more sensible, they do what that woman (Mirveta) did last month. They kill their scum-babies.'</p> <p>Agron Krasniqi, a gynaecologist at Pristina's University Hospital, is also at the table. 'All of us, we were conducting abortions around the clock,' he said. 'Only a few weeks ago we had a woman who came to the hospital and said she was raped and could we help. She was six months pregnant. There are so many women like that...Women who couldn't physically make the journeys to hospitals and private clinics because they couldn't afford it or didn't dare tell their husbands. In this instance, there was nothing we could do. It was a terrible business, as terrible as the abandoned babies we've also got at the hospital.'</p> <p>Abandoned babies?</p> <p>'Yes, we've got eight new-born babies and a roomful in the paediatric ward. There are boys as well. In our culture, boys are usually never abandoned. It is fair to say most are the product of rape.' No one wants to talk about the abandoned babies; no one wants to associate them with rape. But there they are, on the second floor of the Pristina clinic in an airy room off a chamber lined with incubators. Babies less than eight weeks old lie in little plastic cases, the others in blue-and-white check-cloth cots.</p> <p>The doctors have given them names which they have written in blue ink on plasters they have stuck to their beds. 'They have nothing. The least we can do for their dignity is give them names,' said Enser, the neo-natalist. 'We try to cradle them, hug them whenever we can, because we now know how important the first six months are in a baby's life. Before we didn't do it, and you could see the difference.'</p> <p>Did the mothers ever return to claim them? 'Never,' he said. 'And we don't really have any idea who they are because they usually come alone, very early, around 5am so no one will see them and then they give us false names. An American woman, a midwife, came the other day. She wanted to adopt Teuta, our oldest one, but the authorities don't want any to go abroad, they want them to stay here.'</p> <p>In the paediatric wing, there are 12 more abandoned children, all between six and 18 months. They are kept for most of the day in a small room, playing on plastic tricycles, lying on mattresses, sitting on nurses' laps. Some are dark, some blond, some obviously Slavic with give-away high cheekbones and broad faces.</p> <p>When we open the door they come rushing out, tugging at the hems of our skirts, jumping up and down, beseeching to be held. 'They are lovely children,' said the nurse, apologising for her insistence that in the room, at least, we do not take any pictures. 'There are other rape-babies, you know, in other hospitals. There are some in Prizren and some in Pec.'Around Pec, Serb paramilitaries and the Yugoslav army appear to have acted with wanton abandon, raping women in barracks, public buildings and private homes. It is in Pec that the UN-sponsored International Rescue Committee has established the Women's Wellness Centre, one of only two international organisations in Kosovo specialising exclusively in violence against women. The centre has taken a holistic approach in its attempt to attract victims. And since opening six months ago it has run classes in English, sewing and art.</p> <p>But getting these same women to tell their stories is another matter. 'We have a lot of cases of domestic violence, which is prevalent in this culture,' said Jeanne Ward, an American psychotherapist who has worked on similar programmes in New York. 'But so far absolutely no rape cases, although a great many women are suffering from depression, isolation, nightmares, flashbacks, all the symptoms of such trauma. Confidentiality is a big problem here and the social stigma is just so great. Kosovar women are afraid that if they are perceived to have been raped they will automatically be cut off from their families, children, everyone .'</p> <p>'Let me tell you a story,' she said. 'I know of one woman who was raped and when it got out she was immediately dropped by her fianc\u00e9. The dishonour, he said, was just too much. Since she's been deflowered and is no longer seen as fit for marriage, her family have made her a prisoner. She is now a servant to the household.'</p> <p>The centre's Albanian director, Lumnije Decani, interrupted. 'Jeanne is right,' she said. 'It will take time, but I'm sure women will come. They want to, I know, they need to talk, which is why we are going to install 24-hour hotlines. You should go to Belegu.' 'And Lubeniq,' said the American.</p> <p>It was in Lubeniq that about 70 men were shot dead in the village square, after taking up arms to protect their women. They had heard about the mass rapes. And they were scared. Belegu lies in the middle of a plain and Lubeniq stands on a hill on the road that leads to it. They are both wretched places, polluted by violence and death.</p> <p>We stop at Lubeniq on the way to Belegu to find children playing around their relatives' graves. 'My daddy is in there,' said Mentor Ukshinaj, pointing to the mound of earth bearing a wooden stump and the name of Hajdar Ukshinaj. 'He died protecting my mummy. He died in front of me.'</p> <p>When we go to Belegu, the members of the first house, a fine stone building erected around a triangular courtyard, rush out to greet us. Beqir Zukaj, a proud man in a white felt cap who is the head of the extended family, did not mince his gestures. Outside his stone, high-walled house, he made thrusting movements and performed the charade of ripping off his wife's clothes. 'It didn't happen here,' he said. 'It happened in the big barn in the other end of the village.'</p> <p>Sevdije Hoxha was there and she remembered everything. Hundreds of people had converged on Belegu from other villages on the plain and when the Serbs began to encircle them they hid in the barn.</p> <p>We went to the barn and she showed us its big lime-coloured doors. 'They came, they separated the women from the men, they took all our documents and then they took away the young ones. They took them to the brick building here,' she said, pointing to the half-constructed red-brick villa next door. 'We had plastered some of the pretty ones with animal manure, to make them smell and look less nice, but they took them anyway. You could hear them scream, beg, shout. Many have never come back to their villages. They got on tractors, they went to Albania and from there, I think, they went abroad.'</p> <p>The ones who returned to Belegu are broken. 'Broken lives, broken hearts,' said Imer Zukaj, who spent years working in Switzerland. 'There is one young girl here. She is 17 years old. She was raped by six Serbs, who pinned her down, cut her breasts. Whenever I, or any man, greets her, which is when we go to her home, she jumps in the air and screams. She is not well. She is on medication. She doesn't speak. Nobody, you know, will marry her, her life is finished.'</p> <p>When I asked Ahmeti if I could meet some of the victims, she glared. Hers is the only organisation that has managed to reach out to women trapped in villages like Belegu; she is furious that more has not been done for them.</p> <p>After last month's infanticide, WHO initiated a programme to sensitise doctors and nurses dealing with women about to give birth - to spot those who might want to reject their babies. Other than that, Ahmeti said, psycho-social support has been minimal. The women are outcasts. Some are war widows and many have no work, no family, no one to turn to. There has been almost no attempt to socialise, reintegrate or resettle them with therapeutic counselling. Or to provide witness protection so they may eventually give evidence before the criminal tribunal at The Hague.</p> <p>'This is a torn society and there are so many things that have to be done, but these women's needs have really never been addressed. Wherever you go in Kosovo you bump into victims, but these particular ones gain nothing from talking. You just rape their psyche a second time.'</p> <p>She is right, of course. In Kosovo, everyone at some stage has been a victim and you do not have to go far to bump into one. Seated in front of Ahmeti, interviewing her, is 29-year-old Luljeta Selimi, a journalist who trained as a gynaecologist (a profession never allowed to flourish under the Serbs). 'Please excuse my English. I used to speak it very well, but last April the Serbs arrested me helping a friend give birth. They kept me in water for nine hours, beat me until I fainted and then threw me on a rubbish dump. It was Gypsies who saved me and took me to Macedonia,' she said. 'You will never find these women. I have had to spend weeks in villages posing as a doctor, gaining their trust, staying at their homes.'</p> <p>Selimi, it turns out, has collected testimonies from 200 rape victims; each case documented in black notebooks and on cassette. 'I want the world to know what happened to my country, to these women. Thousands of women who now have nothing.'</p> <p>Over the course of the next week she brought me three victims; women who are young, educated and angry with the world. Angry that Nato did not intervene or send in ground troops earlier; that help has not been more forthcoming; that they have been left to drift, dependent on small kindnesses. They have come to me, because they could never have me go to them - it would raise too many suspicions. They are willing to talk because they want the world to know that they exist. They have lost their homes, they have lost their valuables (extorted by the rapists) but they are still the lucky ones. At least they have been spared becoming pregnant.</p> <p>'They stopped our car as my husband, son and daughter were driving towards the Macedonian border on 22 March, two days before Nato intervened,' said the school-teacher from a hamlet south of Pristina. 'They were paramilitaries, some wore bandannas, some masks.</p> <p>'They made us get out and walk over the hills and then _ and then they took me, they made me comb my hair and they did what they did. When my husband tried to stop them, they shot him dead. My children were there, watching.'</p> <p>The two other women were similarly stopped, one as she tried to flee across the Albanian border, the other as she hid with her family in the forest, hours after the Serbs had torched their village in the middle of Kosovo.</p> <p>Both were virgins before and both have avoided sex since. Both hardly leave their homes. And both have the saddest, most vacant eyes I have ever seen.</p> <p>'So what do you think I should do?' asked the one with red-dyed hair, the one who was raped for hours in the forest.</p> <p>I looked at her and thought: 'Yes, what next?' Here I am, privy to the most painful event this woman will ever endure and I have no ready answer; no relief to proffer, only the ability to make her, and the children of war, 'exist'.</p> <p>Some names have been changed.</p>",

As he was pulled from her loins, as the nurses at Kosovo's British-administered university hospital handed her the baby, as the young Albanian mother took the child, she prepared to do the deed. She cradled him to her chest, she looked into her boy's eyes, she stroked his face and she snapped his neck. They say it was a fairly clean business. Mirveta had used her bare hands. It is said that, in tears, she handed her baby back to the nurses, holding his snapped, limp neck. In Pristina, in her psychiatric detention cell, she has been weeping ever since. 'Who knows? She may have looked into the baby's face and seen the eyes of the Serb who raped her.' The words are uttered coolly, undramatically, by Sevdije Ahmeti almost as a matter of course.

Since she's been deflowered and is no longer seen as fit for marriage, her family have made her a prisoner. She is now a servant to the household.' The centre's Albanian director, Lumnije Decani, interrupted. 'Jeanne is right,' she said. 'It will take time, but I'm sure women will come. They want to, I know, they need to talk, which is why we are going to install 24-hour hotlines. You should go to Belegu.' 'And Lubeniq,' said the American. It was in Lubeniq that about 70 men were shot dead in the village square, after taking up arms to protect their women. They had heard about the mass rapes. And they were scared. Belegu lies in the middle of a plain and Lubeniq stands on a hill on the road that leads to it. They are both wretched places, polluted by violence and death. We stop at Lubeniq on the way to Belegu to find children playing around their relatives' graves. 'My daddy is in there,' said Mentor Ukshinaj, pointing to the mound of earth bearing a wooden stump and the name of Hajdar Ukshinaj. 'He died protecting my mummy. He died in front of me.' When we go to Belegu, the members of the first house, a fine stone building erected around a triangular courtyard, rush out to greet us. Beqir Zukaj, a proud man in a white felt cap who is the head of the extended family, did not mince his gestures. Outside his stone, high-walled house, he made thrusting movements and performed the charade of ripping off his wife's clothes. 'It didn't happen here,' he said. 'It happened in the big barn in the other end of the village.' Sevdije Hoxha was there and she remembered everything. Hundreds of people had converged on Belegu from other villages on the plain and when the Serbs began to encircle them they hid in the barn. We went to the barn and she showed us its big lime-coloured doors. 'They came, they separated the women from the men, they took all our documents and then they took away the young ones. They took them to the brick building here,' she said, pointing to the half-constructed red-brick villa next door. 'We had plastered some of the pretty ones with animal manure, to make them smell and look less nice, but they took them anyway. You could hear them scream, beg, shout. Many have never come back to their villages. They got on tractors, they went to Albania and from there, I think, they went abroad.' The ones who returned to Belegu are broken. 'Broken lives, broken hearts,' said Imer Zukaj, who spent years working in Switzerland. 'There is one young girl here. She is 17 years old. She was raped by six Serbs, who pinned her down, cut her breasts. Whenever I, or any man, greets her, which is when we go to her home, she jumps in the air and screams. She is not well. She is on medication. She doesn't speak. Nobody, you know, will marry her, her life is finished.' When I asked Ahmeti if I could meet some of the victims, she glared. Hers is the only organisation that has managed to reach out to women trapped in villages like Belegu; she is furious that more has not been done for them. After last month's infanticide, WHO initiated a programme to sensitise doctors and nurses dealing with women about to give birth - to spot those who might want to reject their babies. Other than that, Ahmeti said, psycho-social support has been minimal. The women are outcasts. Some are war widows and many have no work, no family, no one to turn to. There has been almost no attempt to socialise, reintegrate or resettle them with therapeutic counselling. Or to provide witness protection so they may eventually give evidence before the criminal tribunal at The Hague. 'This is a torn society and there are so many things that have to be done, but these women's needs have really never been addressed. Wherever you go in Kosovo you bump into victims, but these particular ones gain nothing from talking. You just rape their psyche a second time.' She is right, of course. In Kosovo, everyone at some stage has been a victim and you do not have to go far to bump into one. Seated in front of Ahmeti, interviewing her, is 29-year-old Luljeta Selimi, a journalist who trained as a gynaecologist (a profession never allowed to flourish under the Serbs). 'Please excuse my English. I used to speak it very well, but last April the Serbs arrested me helping a friend give birth. They kept me in water for nine hours, beat me until I fainted and then threw me on a rubbish dump. It was Gypsies who saved me and took me to Macedonia,' she said. 'You will never find these women. I have had to spend weeks in villages posing as a doctor, gaining their trust, staying at their homes.' Selimi, it turns out, has collected testimonies from 200 rape victims; each case documented in black notebooks and on cassette. 'I want the world to know what happened to my country, to these women. Thousands of women who now have nothing.' Over the course of the next week she brought me three victims; women who are young, educated and angry with the world. Angry that Nato did not intervene or send in ground troops earlier; that help has not been more forthcoming; that they have been left to drift, dependent on small kindnesses. They have come to me, because they could never have me go to them - it would raise too many suspicions. They are willing to talk because they want the world to know that they exist. They have lost their homes, they have lost their valuables (extorted by the rapists) but they are still the lucky ones. At least they have been spared becoming pregnant. 'They stopped our car as my husband, son and daughter were driving towards the Macedonian border on 22 March, two days before Nato intervened,' said the school-teacher from a hamlet south of Pristina. 'They were paramilitaries, some wore bandannas, some masks. 'They made us get out and walk over the hills and then _ and then they took me, they made me comb my hair and they did what they did. When my husband tried to stop them, they shot him dead. My children were there, watching.' The two other women were similarly stopped, one as she tried to flee across the Albanian border, the other as she hid with her family in the forest, hours after the Serbs had torched their village in the middle of Kosovo. Both were virgins before and both have avoided sex since. Both hardly leave their homes. And both have the saddest, most vacant eyes I have ever seen. 'So what do you think I should do?' asked the one with red-dyed hair, the one who was raped for hours in the forest. I looked at her and thought: 'Yes, what next?' Here I am, privy to the most painful event this woman will ever endure and I have no ready answer; no relief to proffer, only the ability to make her, and the children of war, 'exist'. Some names have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>It was a mistake to play Strauss's Blue Danube waltz at the Odeon, Leicester Square the other morning before the lights went down for Mission to Mars. To be reminded of Kubrick's classic SF movie before seeing Brian De Palma's first essay in the genre was as dangerous as it would be to have someone sing a Verdi aria before the curtain goes up on the Elton John-Tim Rice version of A\u00efda . </p> <p>De Palma's movie comes at an odd time, a year before the setting of 2001: A Space Odyssey and two years before the centenary of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 1902 milestone, A Trip to the Moon. For a century, the cinema has reflected the mood on Earth through our attitudes of fear, wonder and anticipation attendant upon the exploration of space. Fritz Lang's 1929 Woman in the Moon invented the countdown while Werner von Braun was still a schoolboy; Alexander Korda's 1935 masterpiece Things to Come saw a journey to the stars as the salvation of a troubled world; postwar SF flicks such as The Day the Earth Stood Still reflected Cold War tensions. </p> <p>When space fiction started to become space fact in the late Fifties, the ground had been laid for Kubrick's landmark combination of mechanics and mysticism from which all subsequent space films stem. </p> <p>In 1983, The Right Stuff treated the US space enterprise in a historical fashion, looking back to the origins of supersonic flight and the beginning of the Mercury programme in the early Sixties. This has recently been followed up by Apollo 13 which recalled how, as early as 1970, it took a near-fatal accident to capture the attention of jaded viewers. </p> <p>While his friends and fellow movie brats Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were making Close Encounters and Star Wars, De Palma was directing thrillers that paid homage to Hitchcock, and over the years he's brought his kinetic flair and his taste to a variety of genres, rarely attempting to break new ground. </p> <p>Now in his sixtieth year, with a grandiose screen version of the old TV series Mission: Impossible behind him, De Palma has got around to SF with a second mission movie boldly going where others have gone before. </p> <p>The year is 2020 and a joint Russian-American expedition to Mars is being led by black astronaut, Luke Graham (Don Cheadle), presumably named by his parents in honour of the sky walking movie hero. Things go awry when they meet a strange Martian force that sucks the Russians into a lethal vortex, sparing only Luke. He'd been reading Treasure Island with his son before blasting off and had wondered how 'that old Ben Gunn' got marooned. </p> <p>Now he knows and a quartet of colleagues set out from a space station to his rescue. They're the husband-and-wife team, Woody (Tim Robbins) and Terri (Connie Nielsen); the recently widowed systems designer, Jim (Gary Sinise); and the young engineer, Phil (Jerry 0'Connell). Time on board goes slowly and Woody and Terri dance upside down to pass the hours while Jim looks at home movies of his late wife, a fellow astronaut with whom he'd planned to explore Mars. To paraphrase the advertising slogan for Alien, in space nobody can hear you cry. </p> <p>Not everyone makes it there and back, and in trying to land, the rescuers undergo a crisis that makes the Apollo 13 affair look like trouble with the dashboard lighter. They finish up stranded on the red planet equipped with some simple escape aids and some clunky B-movie dialogue. 'I don't see how a quake six months ago could have caused such distortion,' someone remarks. 'That was no quake,' someone replies just a split second after the whole audience has delivered the line in unison. </p> <p>Interpreting a series of test messages \u00e0 la 2001 leads to a close encounter with a higher intelligence. Entering into an all-white palace, the starry-eyed astronauts are entertained by a three-dimensional planetarium display that provides them with a history of the universe. They meet a tall, thin, androgynous extraterrestrial dressed in gold lam\u00e9, which may be the standard Martian uniform, though perhaps this exotic creature is on the way to the Oscars. </p> <p>One way or the other, this scene epitomises the total absence of invention and imagination. There is the possibility that a final sequence has been cut in which it's revealed that the movie is a Tarkovskian hallucination experienced by an early astronaut who's spent his retirement watching SF movies. </p> <p>This idea is not entirely my own, as it forms the background to Galaxy Quest, an hilarious SF comedy which opens in a fortnight's time and is a treat in store.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a mistake to play Strauss's Blue Danube waltz at the Odeon, Leicester Square the other morning before the lights went down for Mission to Mars. To be reminded of Kubrick's classic SF movie before seeing Brian De Palma's first essay in the genre was as dangerous as it would be to have someone sing a Verdi aria before the curtain goes up on the Elton John-Tim Rice version of A\u00efda . De Palma's movie comes at an odd time, a year before the setting of 2001: A Space Odyssey and two years before the centenary of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 1902 milestone, A Trip to the Moon. For a century, the cinema has reflected the mood on Earth through our attitudes of fear, wonder and anticipation attendant upon the exploration of space. Fritz Lang's 1929 Woman in the Moon invented the countdown while Werner von Braun was still a schoolboy; Alexander Korda's 1935 masterpiece Things to Come saw a journey to the stars as the salvation of a troubled world; postwar SF flicks such as The Day the Earth Stood Still reflected Cold War tensions. When space fiction started to become space fact in the late Fifties, the ground had been laid for Kubrick's landmark combination of mechanics and mysticism from which all subsequent space films stem. In 1983, The Right Stuff treated the US space enterprise in a historical fashion, looking back to the origins of supersonic flight and the beginning of the Mercury programme in the early Sixties. This has recently been followed up by Apollo 13 which recalled how, as early as 1970, it took a near-fatal accident to capture the attention of jaded viewers. While his friends and fellow movie brats Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were making Close Encounters and Star Wars, De Palma was directing thrillers that paid homage to Hitchcock, and over the years he's brought his kinetic flair and his taste to a variety of genres, rarely attempting to break new ground. Now in his sixtieth year, with a grandiose screen version of the old TV series Mission: Impossible behind him, De Palma has got around to SF with a second mission movie boldly going where others have gone before. The year is 2020 and a joint Russian-American expedition to Mars is being led by black astronaut, Luke Graham (Don Cheadle), presumably named by his parents in honour of the sky walking movie hero. Things go awry when they meet a strange Martian force that sucks the Russians into a lethal vortex, sparing only Luke. He'd been reading Treasure Island with his son before blasting off and had wondered how 'that old Ben Gunn' got marooned. Now he knows and a quartet of colleagues set out from a space station to his rescue. They're the husband-and-wife team, Woody (Tim Robbins) and Terri (Connie Nielsen); the recently widowed systems designer, Jim (Gary Sinise); and the young engineer, Phil (Jerry 0'Connell). Time on board goes slowly and Woody and Terri dance upside down to pass the hours while Jim looks at home movies of his late wife, a fellow astronaut with whom he'd planned to explore Mars. To paraphrase the advertising slogan for Alien, in space nobody can hear you cry. Not everyone makes it there and back, and in trying to land, the rescuers undergo a crisis that makes the Apollo 13 affair look like trouble with the dashboard lighter. They finish up stranded on the red planet equipped with some simple escape aids and some clunky B-movie dialogue. 'I don't see how a quake six months ago could have caused such distortion,' someone remarks. 'That was no quake,' someone replies just a split second after the whole audience has delivered the line in unison. Interpreting a series of test messages \u00e0 la 2001 leads to a close encounter with a higher intelligence. Entering into an all-white palace, the starry-eyed astronauts are entertained by a three-dimensional planetarium display that provides them with a history of the universe. They meet a tall, thin, androgynous extraterrestrial dressed in gold lam\u00e9, which may be the standard Martian uniform, though perhaps this exotic creature is on the way to the Oscars. One way or the other, this scene epitomises the total absence of invention and imagination. There is the possibility that a final sequence has been cut in which it's revealed that the movie is a Tarkovskian hallucination experienced by an early astronaut who's spent his retirement watching SF movies. This idea is not entirely my own, as it forms the background to Galaxy Quest, an hilarious SF comedy which opens in a fortnight's time and is a treat in store.",

      "body": "<p>'Now I want you all to pop one of these into your mouth and suck, then tell me what you think,' said Chef Yates, who presided over his brood of wannabe young chefs like a twinkly eyed Santa Claus. Lambs to the slaughter, we obeyed, rolling the little seeds over and over in our mouths in that exaggerated way so typical of people who aspire to the pompous sobriquet of gourmet. The sudden explosion of tears and expletives were heard in the next kitchen and Chef Yates and his spluttering, yowling class was carpeted by our battle-axe head of cookery. From that moment on, I hated chillies. I had discovered food that hurts, food that can make you cry. I let no chilli past my lips for the next 10 years. </p> <p>So how come, 20 years on, I crave food that hurts? Why do I hunt out farmhouse Cheddar sharp enough to make the veins stand out on the roof of my mouth, or a tarte au citron so acidic as to make me close one eye and shudder? How come I delight in that little dab of English mustard that gets my sinuses to smart, the horseradish that makes my eyes water and the chillies that sting as much on the way out as they did on the way in. </p> <p>Was it the mollycoddling mother, the over-bearing father, the school bullying or the academic failure that has made me now crave foods that pain me? Could it have been my rejection by the blood-and-guts life of the restaurant kitchen, the string of disastrous affairs or the humiliation that is unrequited love that has sent me in search of food that makes my colour rage and my tongue swell? Perhaps I have become some sort of culinary masochist. Perhaps I should go and work for Gordon Ramsay. </p> <p>There is, as I write, chocolate in my desk drawer (well, a tube of Smarties); a bag of new organic Kettle Chips as big as a pillow in the kitchen cupboard, not to mention the tub of peanut butter on my bedside table, yet they can all stay there - what I want is something with chillies in. Better make that 'what I need'. I 'need' to feel that sting on my lips, that rush of heat at the back of my throat, the gut-tightening sensation of swallowing something full of little red birdseyes, tiny green pepinos or long, fat Anaheim chillies. </p> <p>The kid who cried in cooking class now holidays where he can be sure of getting curry hot enough to make his lips numb, rather than where there is a guarantee of sunny skies and sex on tap. As blissful as a Cornish cream tea, or as bracing as a beachside lunch in the south of France can be, I now head off where the food is hot, tart and heavy with spice. Thailand with its stinging green curries; Kerala and its mouth-popping grilled seafood; even Sri Lanka's endless white beaches got a visit last year. </p> <p>Neither am I too fussy whether I am staying in the cushioned minimalism of an Aman resort or getting my adrenaline rush in the fly-blown sleaze of the wrong side of Bangkok, it is that whip-and-kiss mixture of chilli-meets-citrus-meets-coconut that rings my bell. </p> <p>The general rule is that the smaller the chilli, the hotter it is. Well yes, and no. An innocuous looking chilli that once produced nothing short of cardiac arrest in a peculiarly macho photographer friend of mine was distinctly medium in size. Typically it was a rogue chilli hiding in a plate of mild, gently pickled fruits in a restaurant in Delhi. He may have deserved it. But I cannot handle them all, and I have met many who would still think of me as a chilli-wimp. The one I cannot cope with is the lantern-shaped habanero that turns up in many West Indian recipes. Someone must buy them - they sell them in most of the major supermarkets - but one breath of its fiery juice and I double up and scream for mummy. Yet give me a Thai fish cake no bigger than a two-pound coin and a dish of that sweet hot goo that comes with it and I am as happy as can be. </p> <p>The chilli that really intrigues me is the small red birdseye that comes in net purses in oriental food shops or those quasi Thai spice packs in the supermarket. It is most at home in lemon grass and coconut curries, yet you see it in Indian markets, too. The supermarkets, incidentally, label them Bird Eye rather than birdseye presumably so thickoes like me won't confuse them with fish fingers. They are more like bird's feet, really, no bigger than your little finger, and by turn either devastatingly hot or faintly disappointing. </p> <p>On its home territory, this tiddler turns up in everything from fish curry to salads of raw green mango and cellophane noodles. It is one of the hottest varieties, though not as punchy as the miniature prik khee noo suan, which I think translates as mouse's pooh. Navigate your way through the floating market in Bangkok, or for that matter any market from Bombay to Colombo, and you'll find more varieties than you can shake a stick at, most of them hot and some them excruciatingly so. Some even the local cooks cannot put a name to. Not that it matters to me, just so long as I get to feel a little pain. </p> <p><strong> Prawn cakes with chilli, coriander and lemon grass</strong><br> </p> <p> Fragile little prawn cakes, all hot and lemony. Prawns are less obliging than white fish or crab and need something to bind them in a fishcake; use egg, if you wish, but I have used mayonnaise before now. Totally inauthentic, of course - though American cooks put a dollop in their crab cakes - but it binds and adds a certain creaminess to the finished cake. These cakes are rich, hot, citrus and spicy. They need a little salad or rice to go with them. Last time I made them, I had sticky rice and some spinach salad with them, and a mango afterwards. I suggest that you cook one first to check it for seasoning. They are at their best when somewhat wobbly and crumbly, so avoid the temptation to over-mould them. A gentle pat with floury hands will suffice. Makes about 12, serving three each. </p> <p>400g prawns, defrosted </p> <p>2 small or one large stalk of lemon grass </p> <p>2 small cloves of garlic </p> <p>2 thin spring onions </p> <p>2 small, hot chillies </p> <p>a small handful (about 10g) of coriander leaves </p> <p>1 tsp of nam pla (fish sauce) </p> <p>1 egg plus 1 egg yolk or 4 tbsps mayonnaise </p> <p>flour </p> <p>Squeeze the prawns in your hands, to remove any water - otherwise they are inclined to spit during cooking. Chop them very finely, or better still blitz them for a few seconds in the food processor, then tip them into a mixing bowl. </p> <p>Peel back the outer leaves of the lemon grass so that only the tender hearts are left, then chop the soft inner leaves very finely. Peel the garlic and chop it, cut and discard the green bits from the spring onion and finely slice the white, then slice the chillies thinly removing the seeds if you wish. I leave the little seeds in, because this is one recipe where I like a serious amount of heat - but it is up to you. Add all this with the coriander leaves and, if you have them, a couple of the coriander roots thoroughly scrubbed, to the food processor with the nam pla and whiz to a rough pulp. </p> <p>Tip the pulp into the prawns and mix well, adding a little salt as you go. It is worth remembering that nam pla and prawns are themselves salty. Beat the egg and the egg yolk lightly and stir into the prawns, with a dusting of flour. The mixture should be moist enough to shape into patties the size of a flattened golf ball yet firm enough to hold together. Add more egg or flour, if they appear to be falling apart. </p> <p>Over a moderate heat, warm enough oil in a frying pan to cover the bottom. When it is hot, add six or so of the slightly flattened cakes to the hot oil and leave for a few minutes until golden on the underside. Turn them with a spatula - they will be fragile - and cook the other side. They will be done in three or four minutes. Lift them carefully out on to kitchen paper, keeping them warm whilst you fry the next batch. </p> <p><strong> Roast squash with chilli butter</strong><br> </p> <p> Once, pumpkins and squashes were confined to the autumn. Now they are available all year and, unlike asparagus and peas, it doesn't matter that they come from overseas - they hardly have what you might call a short shelf-life. Serves 2 as an accompaniment. </p> <p>500g pumpkin or squash </p> <p>50g butter </p> <p>1 tbsp of ground nut or vegetable oil </p> <p>2 tbsps of dry sherry or vermouth </p> <p>a medium sized red chilli, seeded and chopped </p> <p>Cut the pumpkin into wedges and cut out the seeds and fibres from the core. There is no need to peel it, everyone can scrape the soft flesh off the skin at the table. Mash the butter with the oil, dry sherry, a little salt, ground black pepper and the seeded and chopped chilli. </p> <p>Spread the chilli butter over the pumpkin and place in a roasting tin. Cover the tin with kitchen foil and put in a preheated oven at 180 C/gas mark 4. Leave to roast for 45 minutes, then remove the tin foil, spoon any juices over the pumpkin and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes or so, until the pumpkin is truly tender. You should be able to effortlessly crush it with a fork. </p>",

      "body": "<p>I have a deep, irrational and well-nourished dislike of house plants. Well, not entirely irrational, because most of them are ugly. Why do people suspend all aesthetic judgement just because they are dealing with a plant? It sometimes happens when gardeners become more interested in collecting and growing plants than in making and caring for a garden. It always happens when people become obsessed with a particular genus - and whenever people start to keep house plants. Coleus are the worst. Crotons come a close second. The combination of lime greens, yellows, and burgundy-browns is repulsive. And before you write in, I know they are now known as Solenostemon scutellarioides - as if that makes any difference. You can change your name, but you can't hide. </p> <p> Flicking in one easy swoop of prejudice from the Far East to South America, we alight on begonias. If begonias were a song, they would be the kind of maudlin croon performed by a 'family entertainer' in a toupee that leaves you turning inside out with embarrassment. The leaves have a bat's-wing quality, with colourings reminiscent of the pavement outside a pub at closing time on a Saturday night. A little over the top? I've only just begun. </p> <p> I have never understood the attraction of 'jungle' plants crammed into a living room. Don't people know how horrible the jungle is? Interesting, for sure, but horribly so. My wife lived in New Guinea for years and she says that the jungle is ugly. I saw a programme on telly the other day about the relationship between the great film director Werner Herzog and the utterly compelling actor Klaus Kinski, both locked into mutual loathing halfway up the Amazon. While Kinski claimed affinity with all nature, Herzog took the camera to one side to tell it the truth about the jungle: 'I hate it,' he intoned, his face a mask of depression and obsession. 'I hate the way it destroys everything. Everything is killing everything else. The birds don't sing - they scream.' Most house plants scream, too - or else look you dully in the eye and drone in a monotone about how much they hate your living room. </p> <p> If every plant has its moment, then all the ficuses, ferns, spider plants and gawky palms collecting dust are a poised at exactly 5.35pm on a wet Sunday afternoon. Poinsettias and anthuriums are an ugly con-trick, busy Lizzies vapid, bromeliads are like the product of an expensive cracker and, to my genuine regret and bewilderment, I have always found the waxy, cold-blooded beauty of orchids to be profoundly unsexy. Should an orchid be sexy? Of course. It scarcely exists otherwise.</p> <p>The main problem for house plants lies in the house. Indoors is dark - even a window in full sun cuts out 25 per cent of the light, and levels fall with every foot that you move away from the window. Indoors is dry and subject to huge temperature variations, especially in winter, when central heating kicks on and off. Thus the only plants that survive tend to be those that lurk in dry shade, clinging on to their evolutionary niche. You trawl the globe looking for plants that will toler- ate your home - lovely as I am sure it is for humans - and the result is nothing like a garden. Gardens are centred in locality, gloriously parochial and dictated by minute details of soil, weather and exposure. Take all that away and you end up with airport-lounge gardening. </p> <p> I could have lied, of course. A gardening column should perhaps wheel out advice like a doctor administering to kneecap and liver alike, but it is not my way. I am not proud of it. Indulging in prejudices never added a jot to the sum of human happiness or wisdom. I am also aware that I am lucky enough to have a garden in which to indulge all my horticultural needs, and that there are plenty of people without one who grow what they can indoors. I was talking about this with a friend whose house is stuffed with house plants on every windowsill. She said that although she now has a garden, after years of living in a flat, she could not live without the softening effect of house plants indoors. OK, it's a view. But I am not sure that I want indoors to be softened in such an obvious way. I would rather have a bare room where the softness came from the way the sunlight splashed across the walls. But the temporary nature of a vase of flowers is something else altogether. This, I think, is the problem: house plants go on too long. They are like Christmas decorations in May or birthday garlands six months after the day, when you are older and no wiser. </p> <p>How can I share the pleasure that house plants so obviously give to so many people? For a start, I like bringing pot-grown plants indoors at their prime. I write this looking in the eye an agapanthus that has been flowering indoors for the past month. It was outside all summer and then rested in the greenhouse over winter. We do this with a couple of citrus trees, cowslips, snowdrops, primroses, violets, hyacinths and narcissi, all grown in terracotta pots; and also with lilies and geraniums with scented leaves. None lasts nearly as long as identical plants that remain outside all the time - but they give a lot of pleasure. When they are past their best, they are all stashed away out of sight until next year. So they are hardly house plants. </p> <p> I love cut flowers - in tiny, delicate vases or as great explosions of leaf and flower, all brought indoors as theatre and decoration. But when they start to fade, they all go on to the compost heap. </p> <p> I like the halfway house of a conservatory and would happily grow daturas and brugmansias in one. We have Brugmansia sanguinea and B versicolor growing in the greenhouse, which gets in the way of everything else but flowers from August through to November and is wasted in there. If the pots were not so heavy, I would bring them indoors when they flowered, so a conservatory would be ideal. The citrus would like it, too. And salvias would be good in the conservatory or in a very bright room, mainly to continue the work they do perfectly well outside until the frosts come. Cuttings taken from healthy plants in spring, before they went outside, would be ideal, and the over-wintered 'house' plants could be pruned back and planted out each May.

      "bodyText": "I have a deep, irrational and well-nourished dislike of house plants. Well, not entirely irrational, because most of them are ugly. Why do people suspend all aesthetic judgement just because they are dealing with a plant? It sometimes happens when gardeners become more interested in collecting and growing plants than in making and caring for a garden. It always happens when people become obsessed with a particular genus - and whenever people start to keep house plants. Coleus are the worst. Crotons come a close second. The combination of lime greens, yellows, and burgundy-browns is repulsive. And before you write in, I know they are now known as Solenostemon scutellarioides - as if that makes any difference. You can change your name, but you can't hide. Flicking in one easy swoop of prejudice from the Far East to South America, we alight on begonias. If begonias were a song, they would be the kind of maudlin croon performed by a 'family entertainer' in a toupee that leaves you turning inside out with embarrassment. The leaves have a bat's-wing quality, with colourings reminiscent of the pavement outside a pub at closing time on a Saturday night. A little over the top? I've only just begun. I have never understood the attraction of 'jungle' plants crammed into a living room. Don't people know how horrible the jungle is? Interesting, for sure, but horribly so. My wife lived in New Guinea for years and she says that the jungle is ugly. I saw a programme on telly the other day about the relationship between the great film director Werner Herzog and the utterly compelling actor Klaus Kinski, both locked into mutual loathing halfway up the Amazon. While Kinski claimed affinity with all nature, Herzog took the camera to one side to tell it the truth about the jungle: 'I hate it,' he intoned, his face a mask of depression and obsession. 'I hate the way it destroys everything. Everything is killing everything else. The birds don't sing - they scream.' Most house plants scream, too - or else look you dully in the eye and drone in a monotone about how much they hate your living room. If every plant has its moment, then all the ficuses, ferns, spider plants and gawky palms collecting dust are a poised at exactly 5.35pm on a wet Sunday afternoon. Poinsettias and anthuriums are an ugly con-trick, busy Lizzies vapid, bromeliads are like the product of an expensive cracker and, to my genuine regret and bewilderment, I have always found the waxy, cold-blooded beauty of orchids to be profoundly unsexy. Should an orchid be sexy? Of course. It scarcely exists otherwise. The main problem for house plants lies in the house. Indoors is dark - even a window in full sun cuts out 25 per cent of the light, and levels fall with every foot that you move away from the window. Indoors is dry and subject to huge temperature variations, especially in winter, when central heating kicks on and off. Thus the only plants that survive tend to be those that lurk in dry shade, clinging on to their evolutionary niche. You trawl the globe looking for plants that will toler- ate your home - lovely as I am sure it is for humans - and the result is nothing like a garden. Gardens are centred in locality, gloriously parochial and dictated by minute details of soil, weather and exposure. Take all that away and you end up with airport-lounge gardening. I could have lied, of course. A gardening column should perhaps wheel out advice like a doctor administering to kneecap and liver alike, but it is not my way. I am not proud of it. Indulging in prejudices never added a jot to the sum of human happiness or wisdom. I am also aware that I am lucky enough to have a garden in which to indulge all my horticultural needs, and that there are plenty of people without one who grow what they can indoors. I was talking about this with a friend whose house is stuffed with house plants on every windowsill. She said that although she now has a garden, after years of living in a flat, she could not live without the softening effect of house plants indoors. OK, it's a view. But I am not sure that I want indoors to be softened in such an obvious way. I would rather have a bare room where the softness came from the way the sunlight splashed across the walls. But the temporary nature of a vase of flowers is something else altogether. This, I think, is the problem: house plants go on too long. They are like Christmas decorations in May or birthday garlands six months after the day, when you are older and no wiser. How can I share the pleasure that house plants so obviously give to so many people? For a start, I like bringing pot-grown plants indoors at their prime. I write this looking in the eye an agapanthus that has been flowering indoors for the past month. It was outside all summer and then rested in the greenhouse over winter. We do this with a couple of citrus trees, cowslips, snowdrops, primroses, violets, hyacinths and narcissi, all grown in terracotta pots; and also with lilies and geraniums with scented leaves. None lasts nearly as long as identical plants that remain outside all the time - but they give a lot of pleasure. When they are past their best, they are all stashed away out of sight until next year. So they are hardly house plants. I love cut flowers - in tiny, delicate vases or as great explosions of leaf and flower, all brought indoors as theatre and decoration. But when they start to fade, they all go on to the compost heap. I like the halfway house of a conservatory and would happily grow daturas and brugmansias in one. We have Brugmansia sanguinea and B versicolor growing in the greenhouse, which gets in the way of everything else but flowers from August through to November and is wasted in there. If the pots were not so heavy, I would bring them indoors when they flowered, so a conservatory would be ideal. The citrus would like it, too. And salvias would be good in the conservatory or in a very bright room, mainly to continue the work they do perfectly well outside until the frosts come. Cuttings taken from healthy plants in spring, before they went outside, would be ideal, and the over-wintered 'house' plants could be pruned back and planted out each May. This is the point - house and garden combining rather than house plants seen as a separate zone. Is this any good? Am I getting there? The honest truth is that I think if I really had no garden - no possibility of an allotment, no little yard, however dingy - I would forgo house plants and buy cut flowers daily. When we lived in London, I would often go and cut a bunch of flowers from the garden to take as a present when going to friends for dinner. I suspect no one realised the agonies that had gone into deciding which to cut.

Like many of Benjamin's ideas, this proposal is highly intriguing but difficult to substantiate. Almost all types of totalitarian rule aspire to control the arts, to use them for propaganda, to ornament the rituals which enact the scenarios of ideology. </p> <p>This investment in the aesthetic is as characteristic of Augustan or Neronian Rome as it is of the France of Versailles and of Napoleon's imperium. The very notion of the totalitarian implies the marshalling, the control of emotional responses which architecture, music, the plastic arts and literature are empowered to manipulate. </p> <p>These generalities took on heightened intensity in the case of national socialism. Hitler had hoped to be an artist, was steeped in Wagnerian and romantic music and regarded the German cultural legacy, barring its few Jewish intruders, as second to none. His victories were to climax in the construction of the world's finest museum to be located in Linz. The epic stagings of Nazi mass rallies succeeded in endowing brutal kitsch with undeniable magnificence. To this day, documentary records of those torches in the night, of the F\u00fchrer striding towards his podium through tens of thousands of absolutely motionless acolytes, retain their shaming spell. No other ideology has found a comparable aesthetic, a comparable rhetoric and choreography of iconic gestures. </p> <p>Thus the regime had its art policies from the outset. The mortal struggle against Weimar democracy and racial impurity entailed the identification and elimination of 'degenerate' forms of painting and sculpture even as it entailed the burning of corrupted and corrupting books.</p> <p>It was precisely the prodigal, experimental energies of Weimar aesthetics, the cosmopolitan liberalities of the avant-garde, often Marxist and even Bolshevik in its sympathies, which necessitated merciless cleansing. The more so as a major portion of the art market, of art criticism and art-historical scholarship happened to be in Jewish hands.</p> <p>By the late 1930s, the aryanisation of the arts had robbed or done to death most of its verminous victims. Exhibits of condemned works contrasted with those of the monumentality, marmoreal purity and muscular heroism integral to the promise of a new order. With Hitler's conquest of much of Europe, this process assumed a vast scale. Behind the Panzers came the art thieves. Professor Petropoulos cites official German estimates which put at some 21,000 the number of works of art looted in the occupied territories, notably France, the Netherlands and Poland. The agents of mass larceny were museum custodians, historians of art in the academy, servile dealers and middlemen of more or less vulgar provenance. Their motives ranged from Nazi convictions to careerism and naked greed. </p> <p>This book recounts the biographies of some of the most prominent among the vultures. It tells of the stellar curriculum of Hans Posse, director both of the State Painting Gallery in Dresden and the F\u00fchrermuseum. Ernst Buchner came near to presiding over the bureaucracy of plunder. Hitler awarded him a special Iron Cross. Dealers, often with accomplices in the Reich at large provided Hitler, Goering and lesser fry with choice desiderata. The arch villain in Petropoulos's rogue's gallery is Kajetan Muhlmann. Resplendent in Gestapo uniform, this adroit, charming hooligan played a crucial part in the despoilation of the Netherlands and Poland. </p> <p>The book spurts to angry life when Petropoulos records the postwar immunities and pardons enjoyed by these corrupt pirates. A very few committed suicide. The major players suffered the minor inconveniences of often benign de-Nazification procedures at the hand of largely indifferent, even sympathetic US occupiers. Others kept out of sight and re-emerged into respectability and cushioned retirement. </p> <p>The trouble with this concerned, justly incensed survey is one of missing or avoided context. Conquerors have looted and brought home the treasures of their defeated foes since the beginnings of recorded history. Ancient Rome was crammed with statues and artefacts transported in triumph from Iberia to Jordan, from Batavia to Egypt.

      "bodyText": "The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany Jonathan Petropoulos Penguin \u00a320, pp395 Buy it at BOL Walter Benjamin argued that communism aims to make the arts political whereas fascism, and that is more damaging, seeks to aestheticise politics. Like many of Benjamin's ideas, this proposal is highly intriguing but difficult to substantiate. Almost all types of totalitarian rule aspire to control the arts, to use them for propaganda, to ornament the rituals which enact the scenarios of ideology. This investment in the aesthetic is as characteristic of Augustan or Neronian Rome as it is of the France of Versailles and of Napoleon's imperium. The very notion of the totalitarian implies the marshalling, the control of emotional responses which architecture, music, the plastic arts and literature are empowered to manipulate. These generalities took on heightened intensity in the case of national socialism. Hitler had hoped to be an artist, was steeped in Wagnerian and romantic music and regarded the German cultural legacy, barring its few Jewish intruders, as second to none. His victories were to climax in the construction of the world's finest museum to be located in Linz. The epic stagings of Nazi mass rallies succeeded in endowing brutal kitsch with undeniable magnificence. To this day, documentary records of those torches in the night, of the F\u00fchrer striding towards his podium through tens of thousands of absolutely motionless acolytes, retain their shaming spell. No other ideology has found a comparable aesthetic, a comparable rhetoric and choreography of iconic gestures. Thus the regime had its art policies from the outset. The mortal struggle against Weimar democracy and racial impurity entailed the identification and elimination of 'degenerate' forms of painting and sculpture even as it entailed the burning of corrupted and corrupting books. It was precisely the prodigal, experimental energies of Weimar aesthetics, the cosmopolitan liberalities of the avant-garde, often Marxist and even Bolshevik in its sympathies, which necessitated merciless cleansing. The more so as a major portion of the art market, of art criticism and art-historical scholarship happened to be in Jewish hands. By the late 1930s, the aryanisation of the arts had robbed or done to death most of its verminous victims. Exhibits of condemned works contrasted with those of the monumentality, marmoreal purity and muscular heroism integral to the promise of a new order. With Hitler's conquest of much of Europe, this process assumed a vast scale. Behind the Panzers came the art thieves. Professor Petropoulos cites official German estimates which put at some 21,000 the number of works of art looted in the occupied territories, notably France, the Netherlands and Poland. The agents of mass larceny were museum custodians, historians of art in the academy, servile dealers and middlemen of more or less vulgar provenance. Their motives ranged from Nazi convictions to careerism and naked greed. This book recounts the biographies of some of the most prominent among the vultures. It tells of the stellar curriculum of Hans Posse, director both of the State Painting Gallery in Dresden and the F\u00fchrermuseum. Ernst Buchner came near to presiding over the bureaucracy of plunder. Hitler awarded him a special Iron Cross. Dealers, often with accomplices in the Reich at large provided Hitler, Goering and lesser fry with choice desiderata. The arch villain in Petropoulos's rogue's gallery is Kajetan Muhlmann. Resplendent in Gestapo uniform, this adroit, charming hooligan played a crucial part in the despoilation of the Netherlands and Poland. The book spurts to angry life when Petropoulos records the postwar immunities and pardons enjoyed by these corrupt pirates. A very few committed suicide. The major players suffered the minor inconveniences of often benign de-Nazification procedures at the hand of largely indifferent, even sympathetic US occupiers. Others kept out of sight and re-emerged into respectability and cushioned retirement. The trouble with this concerned, justly incensed survey is one of missing or avoided context. Conquerors have looted and brought home the treasures of their defeated foes since the beginnings of recorded history. Ancient Rome was crammed with statues and artefacts transported in triumph from Iberia to Jordan, from Batavia to Egypt. What would the (Napoleonic) Louvre or the British Museum be without their acquisitions by force? The extent of Soviet pillage at the close of the war and thereafter remains difficult to assess. The frequently close association of Nazi art policies and robbery with the Holocaust is a specific, loathsome feature. But this would have been a more significant book had Petropoulos discussed the phenomenon of the dissemination of art via conquest, the more so as this issue - witness the Elgin Marbles - is very much under debate.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Amy Jenkins is the media darling thirtysomething who \"has it all\",' gushes the author biography on the proof copy of her first novel, Honey Moon , reminding us that she is also the 'daughter of political columnist Peter Jenkins and stepdaughter of Guardian commentator Polly Toynbee'. You can't help feeling they might as well have added 'and if that hasn't immediately turned you against her, just remember she was paid \u00a3600,000 for this book on the basis of one chapter and that doesn't include the film rights'. </p> <p>'I was furious about that,' Amy Jenkins says. She's sipping Aqua Libra in London's Groucho Club (where else would you expect to find a media darling?) but this is the only nod to the image projected on the book jacket. In all other respects, she seems understated - quiet, measured, younger than her 33 years and not spoilt by the hype and her sudden fame. </p> <p>'What they put on the back of the proof was appalling,' she continues. 'It's not even as if my parents were that famous; if my dad had been Laurence Olivier, that would be different. I don't suppose many people have even heard of my dad.' </p> <p>They will almost certainly have heard of This Life , though, the other name that is always invoked when emphasising Jenkins's credentials. The cult television series about a group of young London lawyers sharing houses, beds, fags and court cases was her first writing break after dropping out of a law course at University College, London and drifting for a few years, 'drugging and clubbing and running my market stall down Portobello'. Its success was undoubtedly the rationale behind the inflated advance paid for Honey Moon . 'That and the first chapter,' she says, slightly defensively. </p> <p>Since This Life, the rise of Amy Jenkins has appeared irresistible. As well as her book deal, she has been involved in a number of film projects, one of which, Elephant Juice , has been shot by Miramax starring Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and This Life 's Daniela Nardini (it has yet to find a distributor). She is also the subject of a BBC documentary, Amy Jenkins: This Life, That Girl , to be screened in July. The 50-minute programme is a profile of her life and work, with contributions from Polly Toynbee, among others. </p> <p>This tectonic shift in her fortunes is, in part, thanks to 'a serious amount' of therapy. By the end of her 'wasted years', she has said: 'My life was falling apart. I was unemployed. I had huge debts. I felt so bad most of the time that I was driven to seek help. I've needed an awful lot of therapy to become who I am today.' </p> <p>It is also due to Danny Boyle, the director of Trainspotting , who Jenkins met at the time she went into therapy and who encouraged her to write. Boyle helped her put together a script that led to her finding an agent and eventually having her proposal for This Life read by executive producer Tony Garnett at the BBC, who was looking for someone to write a twentysomething drama of a kind that hadn't been made before. </p> <p>It's easy to assume that her family connections must have made life easy in terms of getting her work noticed. 'It was a help to me in that I met a lot of interesting, well-connected people,' she says, 'but I never, ever managed to get nepotism to work for me - and I tried, I really tried. I'd endlessly be sent off to meet someone who knew someone who might be able to get me a job in the film industry, but no one ever did.' </p> <p>Jenkins is happy to admit that Honey Moon is not as original in concept as This Life . It's a Single Women's Novel, part of the now well-established genre arguably invented by Helen Fielding with The Diary of Bridget Jones. ' I was deliberately aiming for that market,' Jenkins says, 'but when I conceived the novel, in 1998, a lot of those books weren't out, so I didn't realise I was just one of a hundred. I thought it was quite a new thing, actually.' </p> <p> Bridget Jones , which Jenkins thinks is 'brilliant', is clearly an influence on Honey Moon , as are Ally McBeal ('fantastic television drama') and Sex and the City , which she sees as embodying the dilemma faced by professional women in our time. 'The women in Sex and the City spend all their time complaining about how they can't find a man, but when you look at it, they get men all the time; they just don't want any of them,' she says. </p> <p>The problem is that they don't want to compromise the dream, and they don't have to. The dream has always been there, the Mr Darcy figure or whoever, but in the past, women have had to be practical because they needed to find a man, so they learnt to settle for less than the dream. Now that women can support themselves quite happily without a man, why would they need to compromise?' </p> <p>This perennial dilemma - fantasy versus reality, passion versus companionship - is the crux of her novel. Her narrator, Honeymoon Holt, is on the verge of marrying nice, decent but unexciting Ed when she begins to have doubts, mostly centred on Alex (referred to variously as 'the Love of Her Life' or 'the One'), a man with whom she had instant, terrifying chemistry but whom she hasn't seen for seven years. When Alex reappears in her honeymoon hotel, also newly married, the choice between romantic fantasy and something more prosaic, but potentially more durable, is forced dramatically upon her. </p> <p>Strikingly, both Honey and Ed are orphans, like Jenkins herself. 'I don't consider myself an orphan,' she says, almost quizzically, when I mention this. 'My mother died when I was six, but I was 26 when my father died, so it's not the same.' </p> <p>But did losing both parents while she was relatively young give her an edge of independence? 'I do think that when you've laid your parents to rest in your psyche, that's when you really grow up,' she says. 'And your parents don't necessarily need to be dead for that to happen. It's an underlying truth that growing up is about resolving parental issues.' </p> <p>Is this something she feels she has achieved? 'I don't know that I've achieved it, but I believe I am coming to terms with it. In the novel, it's a dramatic device. It's the case with a lot of literary heroes or heroines, even Harry Potter, that they're dispossessed by their parents; it's an easy way of signifying that they're going down their path alone, which we all are. It had a resonance with me that Honey and Ed should have lost their parents.' </p> <p>Peter Jenkins died while she was still unemployed, coming to the end of her party years. She had not yet started writing professionally. Asked if her father's death had affected her confidence, she says: 'It's not impossible that it's linked, that, while my father was occupying centre stage as a writer, I felt I couldn't, but then my stepmother also occupied centre stage and still does, so perhaps that theory doesn't work. Life isn't that straightforward.' </p> <p>Jenkins describes herself as 'very unsuccessful in relationships'; she once said she was 'terminally single', a phrase she often finds quoted back at her. She lives alone in a four-storey house in Chelsea which she inherited from her grandmother. Five years ago, it was filled with friends from UCL and the club scene, who provided her with the inspiration for This Life . Now it's just her. 'I don't claim to have any of the answers. There isn't anyone in my life that I think of as \"the Love of My Life\", but I always used to have this fantasy, you know, that it should have been X.' But if there is a moral to Honey Moon , it could be that, as Jenkins says: 'It's not like that; the fantasy thing isn't true. What feels like passion ends up being pain and loneliness in the end.' </p> <p>There is an element of her own experience in the book, she admits, but more in the way characters articulate thoughts of hers than anything in their particular situation. 'I tend to go for _ ' she hesitates, about to say 'stereotypes', and changes her mind. 'Not stereotypes - that's a derogatory word - but what we call \"on-the-nose\" characters. But I start from the premise of, \"Let's have a nice guy, let's have a bastard, let's have a wacky girl\" - quite broad definitions which I then twist.' </p> <p> Honey Moon will undoubtedly sell in thousands. Film rights have been sold to Columbia, where someone Jenkins refers to as 'a proper Hollywood scriptwriter' is turning it into a screenplay. She is immersed in her next project, writing a feature film she hopes to direct herself. 'Film is what excites me,' she says, 'but I'm happy to have novel writing as another string to my bow. I love the idea that I could write novels in my old age.' </p> <p>The prospect of the eightysomething single women's novel momentarily flashes before my mind's eye. If the genre ever comes into being, it seems certain that Jenkins will corner the market. Unless, of course, her terminal singleness is cured in the interim. </p> <p>\u0095 Honey Moon is published on 4 May by Hodder and Stoughton, \u00a316.99</p>",

The resulting low self-esteem manifests itself in Maria as an inability to take charge of her life and in Rose as an obstacle to personal growth. While the tone of prize-winning Irish writer Anne Enright's second novel What Are You Like? is sad, the story nevertheless rings clear and true. </p> <p>Masterfully written (if a little demanding on its readers), the novel suggests that having access to facts about family history gives individuals power. Without access to the facts, individuals remain incredibly vulnerable, suffering paralysing crises of identity, doomed to repeat 'in ignorance' the secret, traumatic events which formed them. </p> <p>Narrated from multiple points of view, the story begins with the young women's grief-stricken father, Berts. Unfortunately, Berts's distorted and incomplete version of his wife's death and daughter Maria's birth sets the novel off to a slow start. While Berts's story is important (it sets up the central premise of the plot - the crucial omission of the fact that his wife died giving birth to twins), it nevertheless delays the point at which the novel adopts Maria's far more engaging point of view. </p> <p>From the second chapter on, the novel slowly builds up momentum, cutting back and forth between 20-year-old Maria's New York love affair with heartless, tormented Anton and her unhappy childhood in Dublin with Berts and his family with his second wife, Evelyn. </p> <p>The tension increases when the adult Maria discovers a curious photo in Anton's bag. The 12-year-old girl in the photo is identical to Maria at that age, but Maria can't remember the photo being taken, nor has she ever met Anton before. Because Maria doesn't really know who she is, she initially misrecognises it as a forgotten photograph of herself. Later, finding another photo - this time the girl is pictured playing with a younger Anton - Maria confronts him. They row and then he walks out of her life, never to return. All Maria manages to find out is that Anton knew the other girl briefly when he was a teenager. This unhappy affair is enough to push disempowered Maria over the edge. </p> <p>But it's not until the narrator enters the haunted-but-sympathetic psyche of the nun who signed Maria's twin sister Rose's adoption papers that the story becomes properly compelling (Maria's fish-eye-lens version of reality means the reader can only ever partially identify with her plight). And when the subsequent chapter introduces Rose herself, all the character/narrators are in place for the novel to move towards the collision of the two young women's lives. </p> <p>With stylistic echoes of early Joyce, in particular Dubliners, Enright's writing dazzles the reader with its control, even as it frustrates with its distance. The elegant modernist prose and ever-changing point of view means the reader contemplates what are potentially page-turning events from a position of relative detachment. And yet the greater detachment leaves the reader free to move backwards and forwards between plot and subplots, making the various associations and connections and observing the novel's numerous parallels. For example, Anton's abandonment of Maria underlies and mirrors Berts's unhealthy paternal detachment; Maria and Rose's disempowerment by secrets and lies is echoed in Evelyn's practiced denial as the daughter of an amicable alcoholic. </p> <p>The novel works as an allegory for the contemporary political situation in Ireland. In an extended metaphor, the twin girls represent a united, reconciled Ireland. Whereas Maria grows up in Ireland, weakened to the point of self-destruction by the dishonesty and denial within which she unknowingly lives, Rose is adopted by a well-meaning but incompetent English couple. In spite of all the advan tages Rose's comfortable middle-class life affords her, she sees through the hypocrisy and rejects it in favour of the violent truth of blood. It is only once Rose has uncovered the facts and confronted Maria and her biological father that healing can begin. What Are You Like? is a tightly crafted novel with serious, thought-provoking themes.</p>",

Without access to the facts, individuals remain incredibly vulnerable, suffering paralysing crises of identity, doomed to repeat 'in ignorance' the secret, traumatic events which formed them. Narrated from multiple points of view, the story begins with the young women's grief-stricken father, Berts. Unfortunately, Berts's distorted and incomplete version of his wife's death and daughter Maria's birth sets the novel off to a slow start. While Berts's story is important (it sets up the central premise of the plot - the crucial omission of the fact that his wife died giving birth to twins), it nevertheless delays the point at which the novel adopts Maria's far more engaging point of view. From the second chapter on, the novel slowly builds up momentum, cutting back and forth between 20-year-old Maria's New York love affair with heartless, tormented Anton and her unhappy childhood in Dublin with Berts and his family with his second wife, Evelyn. The tension increases when the adult Maria discovers a curious photo in Anton's bag. The 12-year-old girl in the photo is identical to Maria at that age, but Maria can't remember the photo being taken, nor has she ever met Anton before. Because Maria doesn't really know who she is, she initially misrecognises it as a forgotten photograph of herself. Later, finding another photo - this time the girl is pictured playing with a younger Anton - Maria confronts him. They row and then he walks out of her life, never to return. All Maria manages to find out is that Anton knew the other girl briefly when he was a teenager. This unhappy affair is enough to push disempowered Maria over the edge. But it's not until the narrator enters the haunted-but-sympathetic psyche of the nun who signed Maria's twin sister Rose's adoption papers that the story becomes properly compelling (Maria's fish-eye-lens version of reality means the reader can only ever partially identify with her plight). And when the subsequent chapter introduces Rose herself, all the character/narrators are in place for the novel to move towards the collision of the two young women's lives. With stylistic echoes of early Joyce, in particular Dubliners, Enright's writing dazzles the reader with its control, even as it frustrates with its distance. The elegant modernist prose and ever-changing point of view means the reader contemplates what are potentially page-turning events from a position of relative detachment. And yet the greater detachment leaves the reader free to move backwards and forwards between plot and subplots, making the various associations and connections and observing the novel's numerous parallels. For example, Anton's abandonment of Maria underlies and mirrors Berts's unhealthy paternal detachment; Maria and Rose's disempowerment by secrets and lies is echoed in Evelyn's practiced denial as the daughter of an amicable alcoholic. The novel works as an allegory for the contemporary political situation in Ireland. In an extended metaphor, the twin girls represent a united, reconciled Ireland. Whereas Maria grows up in Ireland, weakened to the point of self-destruction by the dishonesty and denial within which she unknowingly lives, Rose is adopted by a well-meaning but incompetent English couple. In spite of all the advan tages Rose's comfortable middle-class life affords her, she sees through the hypocrisy and rejects it in favour of the violent truth of blood. It is only once Rose has uncovered the facts and confronted Maria and her biological father that healing can begin. What Are You Like? is a tightly crafted novel with serious, thought-provoking themes.",

Peter Novick, a Chicago history professor and a Jew, has written such a book, a history of how Americans, and, in particular, American Jewry, thought about the Holocaust from the 1940s, when it was actually happening, to the present day. He asks very uncomfortable questions in The Holocaust and Collective Memory, page after page of them. In general, his tone is wry, cautious, almost weary. </p> <p>At one highly significant moment, however, it rises into flaming anger at the hypocrisy underlying a lot of Holocaust piety. Novick is talking about the death of a million children in the Holocaust while the world 'stood by'. Then he swerves to recall the Rwanda slaughter and note that 10 times that number currently die every year in the world of malnutrition and preventable diseases: </p> <p> 'The possibilities for rescuing millions of children around the world who die, no less horribly, from malnutrition and disease are readily available - and are largely ignored.

One might as well say, he goes on: 'Never again the slaughter of the Albigensians.' </p> <p>Is it possible that these images of ultimate horror, conveyed with such brilliance by writers, film-makers, rabbis, preachers, politicians and historians, may be having little real moral effect? No, clearly not. Their value as a lesson has been immense, in repressing casual racisms in Western society - and repression can be a very good thing, a delicate burying of what is 'natural' until it disappears. But the Holocaust has become exploited, by politics and every group with a grievance. Its centrality is relatively recent, fragile and may die away again. </p> <p>After all, it took a long time for the Holocaust to rise in the US public consciousness. Postwar Jewish survivors were discouraged from speaking out. One Jew who grew up among Zionists in Detroit in the Fifties recalled that the Spanish Civil War was a more evocative event in his community than the Holocaust. The Cold War and Germany's switch from enemy to ally meant 'harping on' about it became a sign of suspect Communist leanings. </p> <p>Later, Jewish pride and worry about Israel, the Eichmann trial, the growth of ethnic particularism, strong Jewish influence in Hollywood and US intellectual life generally, and the celebration of victimhood in US politics, all helped to turn the tide in a most spectacular way.

'The Life and Work of Alphonse Kauders' is a bullet-point biography of a Yugoslavian Zelig, bee-keeper, pornographer and statesman, each 'fact' of whose life is more outlandish than the last: 'Alphonse Kauders said to Rosa Luxemburg: 'Let me penetrate a little bit, just a bit, I'll be careful,' he says. 'Alphonse Kauders, in the course of time, put a revolver on Gavrilo Princip's temple, for he had burned a bee with his cigarette,' he goes on. </p> <p>Hemon gets away with his game playing in two ways: by consistently making sentences that hoard surprises; and by demonstrating that reality throws up as many impossibilities as any acrobatic flight of fantasy.

Bill Clinton has inspired America's creative community, its writers, journalists and filmmakers as no other President in living memory, not even JFK or Nixon. </p> <p>As the Bush-Gore contest moves towards its decisive phase and the New York senatorial race hots up and before Bill'n'Hillary have even departed the White House, there have been more books written about Clinton than any other American President in the twentieth century, according to the New York Times . Leaving aside the right-wing trash produced by Vermin Books, aka The Viper Press, about the Whitewater investigation and the suicide of Vince Foster, there is already a shelf's worth of journalistic commentary, from Bob Woodward's The Agenda (1996) and Jeffrey Toobin's A Vast Conspiracy (2000) to Christopher Hitchens's splenetic indictment of eight years of 'conservatism, cowardice and corruption', No One Left To Lie To (1999). </p> <p>There are also contributions from the First Couple themselves, a his'n'hers of self-promotion, Between Hope and History (1996) and It Takes a Village (1995), vain attempts to offer voters coherence, gravitas and vision where there had been only fuzziness, sniggering and scandal. You can also consult several memoirs by retired and exhausted Clintonistas, from Robert Reich's Locked in the Cabinet (1997) to George Stephanopoulos's All Too Human (1999), each of whom, while shaking his head over the dreadful frailties of 'Slick Willie', reveals an awestruck fascination with the man. </p> <p>If you want to be a fly-on-the-wall in the Clinton 1992 campaign war-room; if you want to know how the Clintons faced the cameras after the first Gennifer Flowers bimbo eruption; if you want to ride in the limousine as the President rewrites his State of the Union address en route to the Capitol and then, when the teleprompter fails, goes on to ad lib the first seven minutes without missing a beat; if you want to stand in the Oval Office when the leader of the free world comes in from his morning jog; if you want to be harangued and abused and shouted at by a red-faced, finger-stabbing, pizza-gobbling, card-playing, tearjerking good ol' boy; in short, if you want to see the warts-and-all side of a supremely professional politician supremely packaged for popular consumption, then these books, especially All Too Human , are hard to resist. </p> <p>Most awestruck of all is the infamous Starr Report, a bizarre compendium of soft porn and prurient innuendo, tricked out with lurid and salacious grand jury testimony, that now seems fatally obsessed with the President's sexual appetite and completely negligent in its duty to explain to the American people why the President should be run out of town. </p> <p>But amid this welter of print, the man himself remains elusive, like all great politicians. Perhaps the conundrum of Bill Clinton is an essential part of his appeal. He was caught with his trousers down in the Oval Office, yet somehow managed to wriggle free, like an indestructible cartoon character. When people say, as they often do of him, that 'character' is the issue, they are unconsciously putting their finger on his fascination. From a dramatic, or fictional point of view, Clinton is all character and perhaps nothing but. Hence the books. </p> <p>Interestingly, the first of these came not from America but Britain. Robyn Sisman's 'what if?' novel, Special Relationship , published in 1995, has an American candidate, now favoured to win the presidency, spending a year at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. Six days before the election, he learns a shocking truth - that he fathered a son with his English girlfriend, Annie Hamilton. Now that son, ready to tell the world the truth about his parentage, is coming to America _ </p> <p>Sisman was indeed at Oxford with Clinton and those who know him say you have to start with the handshake. Another Oxford contemporary, Geoffrey Robertson QC, described an encounter with Clinton at a college reunion in 1983. 'He shook my hand in this extraordinary way. It was amazing. I remember saying, \"Wow! so that's a gubernatorial handshake\". It was an amazing experience.' </p> <p>The handshake is the essential opening gambit of American politics. Joe Klein acknowledged this when he opened his satirical novel Primary Colors with a brilliant evocation of candidate Jack Stanton's vote-wooing clasp: </p> <p> 'I couldn't tell you how he does it, the right-handed part of it ... I can, however, tell you a whole lot about what he does with his other hand. He is a genius with it. He might put it on your elbow or up by your biceps; these are basic reflexive moves. He is interested in you. He is honoured to meet you _ he'll flash that famous misty look of is. And he will mean it. </p> <p> Post-Monica, we can't read that passage in quite the same naive way as before and Klein's satire, which became an enjoyable Mike Nichols film starring John Travolta and Emma Thompson, is now less an inside-the-beltway journalistic scandal than the precursor of an extraordinary number of celluloid reworkings of the Clinton years. It's in film scripts as much as in books that the many-layered drama of the Clinton presidency has been played out. </p> <p>Here again, the Shakespearean comparison is apt. Dramatists of all stripes have always been suckers for power and its mesmerising corruptions. Just as the young Shakespeare spent an important part of his apprenticeship as a playwright exploring and subtly commenting on the dark heart of the Plantagenet and Tudor dynastic triumph, so the scriptwriters of Hollywood have refracted the bruising national experience of Clinton's two terms through the strange public prism of the multiplex. </p> <p>There is a further irony to the dream factory saying to itself that the play's the thing to catch the conscience of the king. Throughout his presidency, Clinton and Hollywood have seemed closely linked. In the early days, it was on the runway at LAX that the President had his infamous $200 haircut. Towards the end, during the darkest hours of the Lewinsky crisis, prominent film industry figures like Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Barbra Streisand supported him with money and endorsements. </p> <p>At first, during the honeymoon period, Hollywood expressed its fascination with the First Couple in films like Rob Reiner's The American President , a soft-centred, romantic comedy, starring Michael Douglas and Annette Bening, which seemed to argue that the President, portrayed here as a handsome widower, should be allowed to have his own private life. </p> <p> The American President , which now seems like Mary Poppins compared to what actually followed, both in film and in real life, also contained a snippet of dialogue that says all you need to know about the people around Clinton and is alleged to have come directly from Stephanopoulos himself. 'It's Christmas,' a presidential aide tells the Stephanopoulos character. 'It's Christmas?' comes the incredulous reply. 'Yeah,' says his colleague. 'You didn't get the memo?' </p> <p>The moviemaking liberals' mood of indulgent teasing did not survive Clinton's disappointing first term. By 1996, Clint Eastwood's Absolute Power , a darkly compelling regurgitation of Drudge Report scuttlebut and Arkansas gossip about rape and drug-smuggling, made no attempt to show President Gene Hackman as anything other than a depraved and murderous psychopath. </p> <p>By the time Barry Levinson's Wag the Dog (1997) appeared, politics and the movies had become interchangeable, it seemed. The film was a fairly broad satire in which a President involved in a sex scandal cooks up a small war to distract the nation's attention, but White House spokepersons found themselves having to deny, as US strike forces were deployed against 'Islamic terrorists', that this was not a ' Wag the Dog ' scenario, an attempt to draw attention from the Lewinsky scandal. </p> <p>Elsewhere, fact and fantasy blurred, as it often does in American life, when Robert De Niro hit the phones to persuade Republican Congressmen not to impeach the President. He failed. Hollywood also responded to the newsworthiness and enduring popularity of the presidency under Clinton by coming up with blockbusting adventure films , notably Independence Day (1996) and Air Force On e (1997) - in which the commander-in-chief takes on the forces of evil in single combat, films which seem to reflect the sense of drama Clinton has brought to the post of national chief executive. </p> <p>The novelisation of Clinton on the screen has not - yet - been matched in books. For a thinly disguised picture of the Clinton White House, such as Joe Klein might have written if he had continued to fictionalise the career of Jack Stanton, you have to turn to Aaron Sorkin's superb political soap opera, The West Wing (Sky TV), in which life and art are so inextricably scrambled that one of the advisers on an excellent script turns out to have been Mandy Grunwald, a former Clinton White House staffer. </p> <p> The West Wing 's President Bartlett, brilliantly played by Martin Sheen, is a hyperactive hamster, a herbivorous creature of gregarious, smooth-talking charm, just another face of the Bill Clinton the world has never fully seen. </p> <p> <strong> Other inspirational presidents include: </strong></p> <p><strong>Abraham Lincoln 1809-65</strong> Sixteenth President </p> <p><strong> Films:</strong> Abraham Lincoln's Clemency (1910); Lincoln the Lover (1913); Birth of a Nation (1914); The Life of Abraham Lincoln (1915); Abraham Lincoln (1925); Abraham Lincoln (1930); Of Human Hearts (1938); Young Mr Lincoln (1939) </p> <p> <strong> Fiction: </strong> A Bullet for Lincoln by Benjamin King (1993). </p> <p> <strong> Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919)</strong> Twenty-sixth President </p> <p><strong> Films: </strong> This is My Affair (1937) In Old Oklahoma (1943) Buffalo Bill (1944); My Girl Tisa (1948) The Wind and the Lion (1975). </p> <p> <strong> Fiction:</strong> Murder in Georgetown by Elliot Roosevelt (1992); Alice &amp; Edith: the Two Wives of Theodore Roosevelt - a biographical Novel by Dorothy Clarke Wilson. </p> <p> <strong> Woodrow Thomas Wilson (1856-1924)</strong> Twenty-eighth President </p> <p><strong> Fims: </strong> Wilson (1944) account of his efforts to keep the US out of the Second World War. </p> <p> <strong> John Fitzgerald Kennedy 1917-1963 </strong> Thirty-fifth President</p> <p><strong>Films:</strong> PT 109 (1963); JFK (1991) </p> <p> <strong> TV:</strong> Kennedy (1983) Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye (1977); Kennedy (1981) </p> <p> <strong> Fiction:</strong> If JFK Had Lived: a Political Scenario by R.

The eager expectation attending this follow-up (it is emphatically not a sequel) to Klein's acclaimed international bestseller, Primary Colors , is both a tribute to Joe Klein's powers of invention and also, more intriguingly, to the grip that the forty-second President of the USA still exerts on the Anglo-American imagination. Four years ago, profiling William Jefferson Clinton on the eve of his disastrous second term as President, The Observer wrote: 'Clinton is a figure for the playwrights, a man of Shakespearean dimensions.' A line that was probably intended to hint at the necessary complexity of any characterisation has been proved spookily prescient in a quite unexpected way.

The space is huge; around it are long windows, domed as if they belonged in a cathedral. Light drizzles through the dusk; you can see a few knights standing around; you hear birdsong and plainchant. The stage of the Gainsborough is a wide, green field. You might begin to think things are all right, but at the back of this pleasantness a brick wall is cleft by a giant jagged fissure the shape of a lightning streak. </p> <p>It's long been obvious that the Almeida's short tenancy of the old Gainsborough Studios was going to provide some of the hottest tickets of the theatrical season. Any Almeida Shakespeare is an event, as the theatre's Hackney Hamlet proved: at Shoreditch, Jonathan Kent directs first <strong> Richard II</strong> and then Coriolanus . Any production with Ralph Fiennes will be sure of an audience, and he appears in both plays. The surprise factor is the building itself: the Gainsborough is its own drama. </p> <p>Constructed 100 years ago to generate electricity, this lofty brick slab has been visited by glamour and neglect.

But it does have its own coherence. Ralph Fiennes's Richard is always intelligent and always interesting.

Simon Higlett's revealing design makes a traverse stage into a rat-run, with the audience banked on each side increasing the claustrophobia.

Scrutinising a range of attitudes in the shape of four officers - one of them corrupt, one an embattled new female recruit - he shows a force bewildered and threatened by the political changes engendered by the peace process. He lays bare both reactionary and honourable traits. Mitchell is a dramatist, not a debater: his ideas are embodied in the action of the play. And they are given brilliant embodiment under Robert Delamere's direction. All these performances are first-rate.

      "bodyText": "Richard II Gainsborough Studios, London N1 The Force of Change Royal Court Upstairs, London SW1 Blue/Orange Cottesloe, London SE1 The Villains' Opera Olivier, London SE1 You cross the pavements of Shoreditch, step into an old Metropolitan Railway power station, and find yourself in a version of pre-industrial England. The space is huge; around it are long windows, domed as if they belonged in a cathedral. Light drizzles through the dusk; you can see a few knights standing around; you hear birdsong and plainchant. The stage of the Gainsborough is a wide, green field. You might begin to think things are all right, but at the back of this pleasantness a brick wall is cleft by a giant jagged fissure the shape of a lightning streak. It's long been obvious that the Almeida's short tenancy of the old Gainsborough Studios was going to provide some of the hottest tickets of the theatrical season. Any Almeida Shakespeare is an event, as the theatre's Hackney Hamlet proved: at Shoreditch, Jonathan Kent directs first Richard II and then Coriolanus . Any production with Ralph Fiennes will be sure of an audience, and he appears in both plays. The surprise factor is the building itself: the Gainsborough is its own drama. Constructed 100 years ago to generate electricity, this lofty brick slab has been visited by glamour and neglect. In 1919 it was converted into film studios by the Famous Player-Laskys; it later became a base for Hitchcock, who made The Lodger there, starring Ivor Novello, and in 1938, The Lady Vanishes . It had a further life as a whisky-bottling plant and as a warehouse for oriental rugs. When the Almeida moves out, the building will be redeveloped as flats. It is brilliant of the Almeida to have alighted on this space, and brilliant of them to have given it to the architectural firm of Haworth Tompkins to convert. This was the firm that refashioned the Royal Court, plaiting together contemporary and Victorian features. It is a firm that is helping to redefine the idea of what a theatre can look like, sheering away both from twentieth-century concrete blocks and the enduring nineteenth-century notion of a West End theatre, fantastic and imperial, with an interior like a ballgown, folded and looped and swagged with gold.
