      "body": "<p>It takes a minute to realise that the man with the unruly hair, baggy T-shirt and grin isn't the guitar tech, but Shawn Lee, the star of the show. He may not look pampered and preened, but he knows what he's capable of. \"I'm the enchanted wizard of rhythm,\" he announces, throwing his head back with a cackle to rival Janis Joplin's. </p> <p>As he slowly builds the vibrant blues of Kill Somebody you can see what he means. Savouring each note, body moving in time, he infuses dark stories of Jack Daniels and working girls with a joyful exuberance, loving every minute. Robert Johnson never looked like this. </p> <p>But this is a blues-jazz fusion for the dance generation. Floating sees the strong beats of drummer Joe Cooper emphasising Lee's fantastic voice, one minute a fragile falsetto, the next a husky, chocolatey drawl. He's from Wichita, Kansas, but has a lot in common with Minneapolis boy Prince in versatility and the desire to push boundaries. </p> <p>If you thought the blues was a forgotten genre, something that is an inspiration for today's artists rather than an ongoing musical force, Lee will prove you wrong. In a forceful rasp he declares: \"I'm still floating, although you try to drown me in bullshit.\" </p> <p>While he's on stage he conveys a happy-go-lucky image - chatting to the audience, admitting that an impressively held note wasn't as easy as it looked. Even so, it's a defiant performance. Dodge sees Lee throwing his head back, tongue out, shaking his hair furiously like Ozzy Osbourne, while Eight Million Ways to Die is a seaside waltz of a song, spinning and turning loveliness, but revealing something nasty behind the faded glamour. Introducing Happiness, from upcoming album Monkey Boy, Lee comments: \"It's not a song about death per se, but it could be if you want it to,\" before the bossa nova beats get funky and Lee sings of fleeting contentment. </p> <p>But after darkness comes light, with Lee offering a copy of the new album to anyone who can name the four songs on his I Can't Save You EP released earlier this year, a request greeted with embarrassed silence. Finally he's reduced to asking if anyone can name the second song of the set. As someone down the front shouts it out and then admits to reading it from the set-list, hilarity sets in. \"Well, you can kiss my ass,\" Lee laughs, proving that the blues can be fun after all. </p>",

      "bodyText": "It takes a minute to realise that the man with the unruly hair, baggy T-shirt and grin isn't the guitar tech, but Shawn Lee, the star of the show. He may not look pampered and preened, but he knows what he's capable of. \"I'm the enchanted wizard of rhythm,\" he announces, throwing his head back with a cackle to rival Janis Joplin's. As he slowly builds the vibrant blues of Kill Somebody you can see what he means. Savouring each note, body moving in time, he infuses dark stories of Jack Daniels and working girls with a joyful exuberance, loving every minute. Robert Johnson never looked like this. But this is a blues-jazz fusion for the dance generation. Floating sees the strong beats of drummer Joe Cooper emphasising Lee's fantastic voice, one minute a fragile falsetto, the next a husky, chocolatey drawl. He's from Wichita, Kansas, but has a lot in common with Minneapolis boy Prince in versatility and the desire to push boundaries. If you thought the blues was a forgotten genre, something that is an inspiration for today's artists rather than an ongoing musical force, Lee will prove you wrong. In a forceful rasp he declares: \"I'm still floating, although you try to drown me in bullshit.\" While he's on stage he conveys a happy-go-lucky image - chatting to the audience, admitting that an impressively held note wasn't as easy as it looked. Even so, it's a defiant performance. Dodge sees Lee throwing his head back, tongue out, shaking his hair furiously like Ozzy Osbourne, while Eight Million Ways to Die is a seaside waltz of a song, spinning and turning loveliness, but revealing something nasty behind the faded glamour. Introducing Happiness, from upcoming album Monkey Boy, Lee comments: \"It's not a song about death per se, but it could be if you want it to,\" before the bossa nova beats get funky and Lee sings of fleeting contentment. But after darkness comes light, with Lee offering a copy of the new album to anyone who can name the four songs on his I Can't Save You EP released earlier this year, a request greeted with embarrassed silence. Finally he's reduced to asking if anyone can name the second song of the set. As someone down the front shouts it out and then admits to reading it from the set-list, hilarity sets in. \"Well, you can kiss my ass,\" Lee laughs, proving that the blues can be fun after all.",

The new internet centres are not being opened in Britain, however, where the threat of 100 more branch closures has been raised following the bank's takeover of Woolwich, but in Africa where it has 250 branches across 12 countries. Through a deal with internet service provider Africa Online, which is backed by London stock market listed African Lakes, Barclays will next month open three pilot centres in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, with a view to opening centres across Africa. \"The internet in Africa is very much perceived as a window on the world,\" said Owen Woodley, head of change management management at Barclays. But, the cost of logging on from home is prohibitive for many Africans. A PC can cost five times as much to buy as in Britain while internet service providers charge as much as $70 a month. Barclays is considering allowing its 1m customers across the continent to pay preferential rates compared to non-customers. Barclays, which is spending \u00a3250,000 on the pilot scheme, will provide advice from experts for users of the internet service which is to be separately branded. Africa Online has internet centres across Africa under its etouch brand. The operation with Barclays will be more upmarket, with higher grade technology such as flat-screen computers and better telephone lines. Barclays, which recently suffered some technical glitches with its online bank in Britain, will eventually start internet banking in Africa but for the time being the internet \"cafes\" will provide access to email and web browsers. The bank claims to be Britain's biggest internet bank with more than 1m online customers.",

      "body": "<p>During the course of the various Kurt Weill retrospectives that have featured strongly in concert schedules over the last year, one of the composer's best works hasn't surfaced quite as frequently as one might expect, namely the Concerto for Violin and Wind Instruments. Written in 1924, it is by far the most popular of Weill's orchestral works. The Proms have redressed the balance a bit with a blistering performance from the great Dutch violinist Isabelle Van Keulen and the BBC Scottish Orchestra under its Principal Conductor Osmo Vanska. </p> <p>It's a tricky piece to get right, its detractors arguing that a preponderance of influences leads to an inherent lack of stylistic unity. The Concerto does, it is true, nod in the direction of Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Busoni (Weill's teacher) before the snappy sardonicism of the mature composer emerges, but here one is struck by its homogeneity of tone and the impressive gradation of its emotional content. It's inherently bleak, a possible reflection of Weill's angst at the emergence of the political far-Right (Mussolini had just gained power in Italy). The wind ensemble seems permanently about to mutate into a military band, its arrogant trumpetings goading the soloist into a response which is by turns shocked and enraged. Lyricism is brief, humour scarce. </p> <p>Written for the Hungarian virtuoso Joseph Szigeti (he never played it), it makes formidable demands on the soloist. Van Keulen, dark-toned, vehemently expressive, is superlative throughout, while the BBC Scottish Orchestra's wind ensemble perform with an uncompromising, steely grittiness. </p> <p>Vanska flanked the work with two of the 20th century's great exercises in colouristic tone painting, Ravel's Mother Goose and Stravinsky's Petrushka. Ravel's fairy-tale suite was swathed in a limpid, tremulous sexuality, its sudden flashes of darkness hinting at burgeoning adolescence. Petrushka was spectacular, though Vanska didn't always quite get to the heart of it in a performance that veered closer to pathos than genuine tragedy. The soul-shattering isolation of Petrushka in his cell didn't quite tear you in two as it should, though the fairground scenes, spiky and intensely driven, swirled with an exhilarating, Dionysian clamour.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"You wanna know why? I'll tell you why.\" So promises a face cream peddler in a New York drugstore, just one of the unlikely places Gay Marshall visits during this endearing dip into Songs and Angst of an American in Paris. You wanna know why it works? I'll tell you why. Good tunes (Cole Porter, Noel Coward, Irving Berlin), simple format (singer about to go on stage takes a good look at her life), plus lots of cross-cultural funnies as American self-obsession meets Parisian hauteur. A tour guide tells some US tourists in Paris of their sartorial crimes; French customer service is shown to be a snooty contradiction in terms; we see auditions from the point of view of a 5ft tall 39-year old woman. There's a little too much of the doubling theme, with Marshall giving herself a good talking to too often. She reminds us of her crisis through her hair: when it is up, it is up, and when it is down, it is down. It is never only half way up, because this is a show about polar opposites, harking back to the good old bad old days of musicals when everything seemed clear. Think about If I Were Me too hard afterwards and you might blush at its naivete. If I were you, I'd just enjoy the moment. \u0095 Till August 28. Box office: 0131-226 2428.",

      "body": "<p>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.\" When God felt wrathful, one of the worst of his punishments, in the case of the snake, the tree and the apple, was to condemn humankind to work. The primal curse today typically lasts 80,000 hours in a lifetime. That sounds like one hell of a punishment and in a sense it is. It consumes physical and mental energy, fills our conversation - and yet it takes up barely 12% of the average allotted span on earth. So is 80,000 hours a big number or not and how angry was God? Work is said to be in the throes of a massive upheaval, but compared with the past, how much of a revolution are we really seeing? </p> <p><strong> There's no job security</strong></p> <p> We may feel insecure but the idea that we have lost the common expectation of a job for life is a myth. Go back 100 years and uncertainty and casual employment were the norm. To some extent, it's a myth perpetuated by the memory the labour movement and trade unions have of their own history. Many developed on the strength of organising workers in, say, the coal industry or shipping and protecting members in those trades all their working lives. But then, as now, most people did different jobs for different employers. There is little evidence of a fall in job tenure which remains at between three and five years. </p> <p><strong> Lads get left behind</strong></p> <p> Unskilled young men are seen as the disaffected casualties of the modern economy - and they often have been. Before the first world war, there was great agitation about the \"boy worker problem\". Boys leaving school at 14 with few, if any, qualifications were drifting into jobs as messengers, for example, which left them time on their hands to loiter in the streets. Youth clubs and Scouts appeared around this time, in part in the hope that they could instil in the yobs some notion of civilisation. There is no evidence this generation grew up more degenerate than any other; whether saved by the Scouts, we can only guess. </p> <p><strong> Stress levels are rising</strong></p> <p> Unlikely. One in five of us now suffers from workplace stress, so we're told. But conditions in the past could be atrocious. The memory of the Depression encouraged some to take whatever work they could get, to stick with it and be thankful. Piece-rate payments and perpetual insecurity could leave workers anxious and under the cosh. There was not much recourse for bullying or sexual harassment, either - now the tribunal would beckon. If there is a rise in stress, it is often driven by ambition, or among select groups such as teachers who are subject to greater scrutiny than in the past. </p> <p><strong> We're all working harder</strong></p> <p> In fact, we have never had it so easy. At the beginning of the 20th century, children would typically start work at the age of 13 or 14 and stay there until 65 or older. Today it's normal for people to stay longer in full-time education and (the occasional bout of summer pint-pulling excepted) not enter the labour market until their early 20s, before retiring commonly by the age of 60. So the typical working life has shrunk from around 50 or 55 years to around 38 - a massive reduction. </p> <p>Not only are our working lives shorter but so are our working hours. A hundred years ago, people would in all likelihood have been working a six-day week. That had come down to five and a half days by the middle of the 20th century and it is now down to five. </p> <p>Those working days are shorter, too. After the first world war, they fell by around seven or nine hours per week, then fell again after the second world war from around 54 hours per week to 46 or 48; in the past 30 years or so there has been a steady decline from around 44 hours to around 37 today. The perception that we are working harder is often associated with progress in our career as we acquire increasing responsibility and seniority, rather than with any aggregate change across the economy. </p> <p><strong> Modern jobs? McJobs!</strong> </p> <p> If McJobs are seen as our future, they are also our past. Services are not a modern invention: the last great surge in the service economy was in the late 19th century when there was a boom in pubs, similar to the revival of pubs, bars and the cappuccino economy today. It has been said that jobs in Indian restaurants now outnumber those in steel, mining and shipbuilding put together, and there has been a big change here. But it is not unprecedented. There was a swift retail expansion in the late Victorian era, too, with the first big movement towards working and buying in the high street. Regional financial centres began moving to London and northern manufacturing wealth was already being eclipsed by the south. </p> <p>The modern domestic service boom was also prefigured about 100 years ago. There is some truth in the idea that more of us are becoming wedding video-makers, aromatherapists or one of the thousand other consultants as we seek out a specialist service niche. But specialisation has been around since Adam Smith in 1776. In the past you might have been a ponty-sticker, a doctor maker, a butt woman or maybe one of the 60 or 70 different and equally forgotten occupations listed in a turn-of-the-century census of the shoe-making trade alone. </p> <p><strong> Home-working is here</strong> </p> <p> There is some evidence of an increase in teleworking (for instance in Finland) but not much. Rates in the UK are little changed; self-employment levels actually show a slight fall. To insist the brave new world is possible because of new technology is to forget that jobs from fur-pulling (plucking out the long hairs to make smoother pelts) to chain-making were carried out at home in the past. The latter, done in the back yard, was a woman's job because it could apparently be combined (goodness knows how) with childcare. Work and a home life of leisure were slowly separated over the centuries. If they do begin to merge again, it'll be a return to ways of old. </p> <p>Our difficulty is to reach beyond the postwar imagery that informs most living memory of what work means. The longer sweep of history suggests that few trends in the labour market are new. And if in the future we fear a life without work, bear in mind a forecast by American economist Paul Krugman: the jobs that flourish will be the ones information technology can't foreseeably replace. So it's goodbye accountants and office workers, and welcome back... gardeners. God really was angry. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting: Michael Blastland.<br> Tinker, Tailor, Teleworker, presented by Evan Davis and produced by Michael Blastland, begins on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm tomorrow.</p>",

Acknowledged as some of the great works of 20th-century art, Balanchine's ballets are being performed by more and more companies around the world. </p> <p>One inevitable consequence of their popularity has been that they have suffered a certain internationalising slipperiness of style. We now take it for granted that the Kirov, for instance, will inflect Balanchine's choreography with a vernacular very different from the British, the French and certainly the Americans. So Edinburgh's coup in securing NYCB for the festival this year should have offered a rare reminder of how Balanchine looks when he is danced in his original idiom and by the company he created more than 50 years ago. However, on the disappointing evidence of Monday's opening night, it seems NYCB may be no more in touch with their founding genius than anybody else. </p> <p>When the curtains opened on Agon (choreographed in 1957), the four male dangers commanding the stage did generate a frisson. Peter Boal, with his heroic swagger, and Jock Soto, with his square - almost loutish - grace, captured exactly the mix of court and ghetto that defines this masterpiece of acerbic dance wit. Rarely have I seen its atmosphere of competitive male display look so muscularly loaded. Wendy Whelan as the first female principal was more than a match for them. She pushed her movements to the same dynamic extremes of quiet tension and drastic force, and, in her duet with Soto, honed her style to a fine blade of lethal glamour. The tentacular lash of her leg as she whipped it up and around Soto's neck, the slow voluptuous malice with which she presented her body to him, were mesmerisingly, fabulously deadly. </p> <p>Yet Maria Kowroski, the company's vaunted new prodigy, lacked the same killer instinct. Looking surprisingly weak in her torso, she rarely capitalised on the power of her long, lush body to articulate the drama of the choreography. </p> <p>A similar lack of spark was evident in the other great Balanchine work of the evening, Symphony in C (1947). Here the female corps looked ragged and distracted, and, apart from Jennie Somogyi, the ballerinas rarely exploited their opportunities to glitter and impose. Again it was the men who dominated, especially the almost fanatically precise and elegant Nikolaj H\u00fcbbe, and Albert Evans, with his contrasting exuberant grandeur. </p> <p>The middle work of the evening was Dances at a Gathering (1969) created by NYCB's other veteran choreographer, the late Jerome Robbins. It's a piece revered in the American canon, yet British audiences may wonder why, for Robbins's response to his chosen music (a series of Chopin piano pieces) is one of limp, pastel-sprigged whimsies. The choreography is arch and skippy and drifts indecisively around wisps of contrived emotion. Frustratingly, given the choreography's weakness, this was the work that displayed the most consistently assured dancing, especially from H\u00e9lene Alexopoulos, who shaped her movements with an impressive boldness, clarity and exotic colour. </p> <p>Hopefully, as the dancers shake down into the season we'll see more of them live up to the legend that surrounds them. </p> <p>\u0095 Further performances tomorrow and Saturday.

Long live the Sunday Pink. </p> <p>For decades the Football Pink Final of the Manchester Evening News has faithfully charted the ups and downs of the Blues and Reds and in its heyday, when websites were found only on the fringes of park ponds and Saturday night television reporting meant a talking head, The Pink was mandatory reading. </p> <p>Students leaving the city for far-flung universities, polytechnics or teaching colleges demanded their mothers parcel up The Pink and send it on so that nothing was missed. Up to last weekend it was an institution, its glory faded but still much loved and cherished. </p> <p>Now it is gone, buried a week before a particularly titillating season, with both City and United in the Premiership. It is bizarre timing. </p> <p>And, even though the soccer fanatics of Greater Manchester have been promised a \"fantastic new-look Sunday Pink\", it will never be the same. For Saturday Pinks or Greens or Blues and occasionally Buffs are dangerous animals, produced on a tightrope, with the thrill of the chase from reporter to printing press to shop counter or street corner redolent of thinly disguised panic. </p> <p>The first place to look is always the late scorers column, for a front-page headline proclaiming \"Tense struggle for United\" might disguise an 87th-, 88th- and 90th-minute hat-trick. </p> <p>Football Finals are a modern marvel, with match reports reaching the public not much more than an hour after the final whistle. Ceefax and the internet may have bruised the magic but a warm Pink 'Un after one's team has won is as lingeringly loving as any other Saturday night caress. </p> <p>My footballing youth did not include away matches, which made the rush for the Football Final all the more memorable. The Grimsby Evening Telegraph always included on its front page a simple, child-like representation of a face whose mouth was upturned for a win, down-turned for a defeat and in a straight line for a draw. I can still feel that lurch of the stomach when the mouth signified the Mariners had sunk. </p> <p> For close to 40 years David Meek revelled in the challenge of writing his Manchester United match reports for The Pink. \"It wasn't exactly an exercise in quality writing but it was the most exciting part of the week for me.\" </p> <p>And he remembers how Tom Henry, a football-daft former MEN editor, would check the front page of The Pink and often rewrite the headline. One painful afternoon at St James' Park, after United had been thrashed 6-1, he came up with: \"United lose seven-goal thriller\". </p> <p>This may not quite match the Dundee Evening Telegraph's blazing \"Broughty ferryman dies in sea tragedy\", run with a smaller, subsidiary headline: \"Titanic Sunk In Maiden Voyage\", but it underlines the wonderfully one-eyed nature of football pinks. </p> <p>The new MEN Sunday Pink promises \"more in-depth match analysis\". Meek takes umbrage. \"Our match reports were entirely our own thoughts and not influenced by what the managers might say later, or the players.\" </p> <p>The story is told of an elderly MEN news editor who, as a boy, was sent to Old Trafford on a Saturday to attach the reporter's match report to the legs of homing pigeons and despatch them to the office a few miles away. </p> <p>To stop the birds flapping he clamped their wings with elastic bands. After attaching the first couple of paragraphs he rushed to the back of the stand and released the pigeon with a steady throw. Splat! He had forgotten to remove the elastic. This Saturday it would not have mattered.</p>",

Ceefax and the internet may have bruised the magic but a warm Pink 'Un after one's team has won is as lingeringly loving as any other Saturday night caress. My footballing youth did not include away matches, which made the rush for the Football Final all the more memorable. The Grimsby Evening Telegraph always included on its front page a simple, child-like representation of a face whose mouth was upturned for a win, down-turned for a defeat and in a straight line for a draw. I can still feel that lurch of the stomach when the mouth signified the Mariners had sunk. For close to 40 years David Meek revelled in the challenge of writing his Manchester United match reports for The Pink. \"It wasn't exactly an exercise in quality writing but it was the most exciting part of the week for me.\" And he remembers how Tom Henry, a football-daft former MEN editor, would check the front page of The Pink and often rewrite the headline. One painful afternoon at St James' Park, after United had been thrashed 6-1, he came up with: \"United lose seven-goal thriller\". This may not quite match the Dundee Evening Telegraph's blazing \"Broughty ferryman dies in sea tragedy\", run with a smaller, subsidiary headline: \"Titanic Sunk In Maiden Voyage\", but it underlines the wonderfully one-eyed nature of football pinks. The new MEN Sunday Pink promises \"more in-depth match analysis\". Meek takes umbrage. \"Our match reports were entirely our own thoughts and not influenced by what the managers might say later, or the players.\" The story is told of an elderly MEN news editor who, as a boy, was sent to Old Trafford on a Saturday to attach the reporter's match report to the legs of homing pigeons and despatch them to the office a few miles away. To stop the birds flapping he clamped their wings with elastic bands. After attaching the first couple of paragraphs he rushed to the back of the stand and released the pigeon with a steady throw. Splat! He had forgotten to remove the elastic. This Saturday it would not have mattered.",

Officials from Fifa, Uefa and all Europe's football associations are desperately trying to protect the traditional transfer market, which is under investigation by the European Union, who could decree it illegal, possibly by the end of the year. Yesterday Fifa, the sport's world governing body, said this week it was sending the EU proposals that could avoid some of the most feared consequences of abolition. After analysing the Perugia case, in which the Italian club refused to pay a fee for a player signed while he was still under contract in Belgium, the EU is set to challenge the requirement of compensation for contracted players changing clubs. EU officials believe the transfer system may infringe workers' right of free movement under its employment law. Fifa's general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen has already predicted \"the end of football\" should a workable solution not be found. Although Scudamore does not make such a stark assessment, he left little doubt about the Premier League's concern. \"It is the number one issue in the game just now,\" he said. \"It is top of our agenda because it would affect us more than any other country. \"The depth of professional football is greater in England than anywhere else in Europe.

      "body": "<p>Alan Curry of the British Council makes his welcoming speech in Spanish, its flow slightly disrupted by a name that seems as unlikely in this context as a miner's helmet under a sombrero. Heaven knows what the great and the good of Mexico City make of the intrusion of \"Barnsley\" into their native tongue, and its coupling with another, slightly more familiar intruder, \"BBC Radio 4\". </p> <p>Those of us visiting from the UK know that the link is forged by the deep, flat-vowelled voice waiting its turn to address the Mexicans in its own native tongue: northern English. The poet Ian McMillan is in town. This is his second visit to Mexico in three years. There is more to McMillan, 44, than his capacity to churn out instant rhymes as the bard of Barnsley FC and Northern Spirit Railways. Radio 4 recognised this some years ago. The British Council has recognised it, too. </p> <p>\"We could bring out endless Turner exhibitions and string quartets to promote British culture,\" Curry tells me. \"But we like to balance that with a contemporary view of Britain.\" This is a view of Britain as a collection of regions with different accents and customs; Britain as a multicultural country with writers and artists who have roots in other parts of the globe. </p> <p>What's happening in Mexico City tonight is happening in other ways in other capitals around the world as the British Council continues its struggle to change outdated perceptions of Britain's arts scene. It is a struggle that the government evidently feels to be worthwhile, judging by the chancellor's recent gift of a 9.1% increase in budget over the next three years - the biggest rise in a decade. </p> <p>\"We work on two levels,\" says Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, who became chair of the council two years ago. \"Yes, we still send out the RSC and the National and various top orchestras. But it's important that that's not all. We have to present more cutting-edge work to give a flavour of the zeitgeist in our country now. This is a process that began a long time before I came here.\" And it will have to go on a lot longer if it is to make any telling progress. The UK may have 16% of what is called \"the world market in creative industry products\", but when the council recently commissioned Mori to carry out a worldwide survey on its behalf, our claim to be a centre of artistic creativity and design excellence took rather a knock.

      "bodyText": "Alan Curry of the British Council makes his welcoming speech in Spanish, its flow slightly disrupted by a name that seems as unlikely in this context as a miner's helmet under a sombrero. Heaven knows what the great and the good of Mexico City make of the intrusion of \"Barnsley\" into their native tongue, and its coupling with another, slightly more familiar intruder, \"BBC Radio 4\". Those of us visiting from the UK know that the link is forged by the deep, flat-vowelled voice waiting its turn to address the Mexicans in its own native tongue: northern English. The poet Ian McMillan is in town. This is his second visit to Mexico in three years. There is more to McMillan, 44, than his capacity to churn out instant rhymes as the bard of Barnsley FC and Northern Spirit Railways. Radio 4 recognised this some years ago. The British Council has recognised it, too. \"We could bring out endless Turner exhibitions and string quartets to promote British culture,\" Curry tells me. \"But we like to balance that with a contemporary view of Britain.\" This is a view of Britain as a collection of regions with different accents and customs; Britain as a multicultural country with writers and artists who have roots in other parts of the globe. What's happening in Mexico City tonight is happening in other ways in other capitals around the world as the British Council continues its struggle to change outdated perceptions of Britain's arts scene. It is a struggle that the government evidently feels to be worthwhile, judging by the chancellor's recent gift of a 9.1% increase in budget over the next three years - the biggest rise in a decade. \"We work on two levels,\" says Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, who became chair of the council two years ago. \"Yes, we still send out the RSC and the National and various top orchestras. But it's important that that's not all. We have to present more cutting-edge work to give a flavour of the zeitgeist in our country now. This is a process that began a long time before I came here.\" And it will have to go on a lot longer if it is to make any telling progress. The UK may have 16% of what is called \"the world market in creative industry products\", but when the council recently commissioned Mori to carry out a worldwide survey on its behalf, our claim to be a centre of artistic creativity and design excellence took rather a knock. Even among apparently informed young people, the best known British artist abroad is Sir Elton John. When I remind Kennedy about the survey she says: \"Perception is always slightly behind reality. If you asked me about contemporary German writing, I'd probably home in on G\u00fcnter Grass. The fact is that British arts and creativity are a strength.

      "body": "<p>Twenty years ago this month, Nicolas Roeg's Bad Timing was briefly and reluctantly released into the community, its own distributor, Rank, condemning it as \"a sick film made by sick people for sick people\". Roeg, then 52, was the visionary firebrand of British cinema, a great underground artist in full flow after the dizzyingly edited mosaics of four earlier works - Performance (1970), Walkabout (1970), Don't Look Now (1973) and The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). </p> <p>He was used to controversy and the repulsion of financiers. Warner Brothers had suppressed Performance for two years and wanted to sue him for unprofessional conduct after viewing its disorienting gender meltdown. But the reaction to Bad Timing was something else. \"Sick... sick... sick,\" said the man from Rank. And it has stayed buried ever since, like a guilty secret. It has never been re-released. It hasn't been available on video for many years - almost uniquely for work from such a major director. </p> <p>Bad Timing barely has a plot. It only really has four characters: psychology professor Alex (Art Garfunkel), his lover Milena (Theresa Russell), her husband Stefan (Denholm Elliott) and Austrian detective Netusil (Harvey Keitel), who interrogates Alex after Milena's attempted suicide. </p> <p>All that really happens is that Roeg unravels the strands trapping two people in love. Flashbacks show Garfunkel - poised, repressed, a professional voyeur who lends his expertise to Nato military intelligence - and Russell, a chaotic force who needs to be free, dragging each other to breakdown in Vienna, while in the film's present Keitel leads Garfunkel toward the memory of what he really did in the hours before the drugged Russell reached hospital: he raped her unconscious body. Scenes of Russell during orgasm and tracheotomy are spliced with surgical flicks of Roeg's editing knife. Keitel probes into Garfunkel's head; Garfunkel and Russell mangle each other's. </p> <p>\"Did you pirate it?\" Roeg asks when we meet to discuss it. \"I like pirate copies. There are some around.\" Bad Timing began with a favourite Italian paperback of the producer Carlo Ponti, a story of sexual obsession that neither Roeg nor his screenwriter, Yale Udoff, read. Its premise proved a gift. \"It was all about frailties,\" Roeg says. \"It was about the fact that you cannot intellectualise your genes, which make aspects of your life inevitable. You cannot intellectualise yourself out of obsession. You cannot cure yourself of it.\" </p> <p>Vienna in 1979 impregnated their work. \"It was an unstable city, a border city, only just handed back from the Russians. To be in a place with so many strange rules and so many dangers, so many police and spies - all that was in the film.\" </p> <p>Next, Roeg mixed the acting elements that would combust in this border zone. Keitel, as the detective who investigates the truth so hard that at one point he seems to hallucinate the facts, and Elliott, beginning a decade of despairingly noble roles as Russell's wry cuckold, were perfect. But it was Garfunkel, with only Mike Nichols's Carnal Knowledge to recommend him, and Russell, a 21-year-old ingenue, who were plunged into Bad Timing's heart. Garfunkel was chosen because Roeg heard he'd once been a mathematician as well as a singer: \"a man of the world, of ideas and connections\". Russell, too, \"wasn't caught up in theatricality, being a star\". </p> <p>Four days into the shoot his two tyro stars begged Roeg to let them leave, and he knew he was on the right track. \"Theresa came first. She said, 'I don't think I'm up to this. I'm terribly nervous. Please let me leave.' I said, 'No. I won't let you. I'm glad you feel that way.' Then I asked Art in. I told them, 'This isn't like another movie. We're shooting fragments of scenes; there's nothing to rehearse. We're in a city none of us knows, an empty landscape. I must ask you to trust that I know where I'm going. It's a maze, but there is an end to it.' We had some Martinis, and they agreed. Somehow, it was a release. I felt all right about pushing them further and further.\" </p> <p>One of the many emotional scatterbombs stumbled over was that Roeg and Russell fell in love (they later married). I wonder if the fearless chaos of her performance is what he fell for. \"When you admire someone's work, you are amazed by who you think they are,\" he says. \"But their real secret is masonic: they keep it right to the end. Very few people are prepared to let you all the way in - to Kafka's 'point of no return'. We went very far. As it turned out, not all the way. Theresa knew it was too dangerous. That's all in the movie.\" </p> <p> It was worse for Garfunkel. Like his repressed character, he had little idea what was in store. \"As we worked, I think he recognised a truth in his character's obsession in himself,\" says Roeg. \"Then he had to decide whether to play it so people he knew would recognise it. It was like coming out. The actors were all nervous and guilty.\" </p> <p>The actors' immersion into their parts became painful. At the film's half-way point, when Russell vengefully demands sex with Garfunkel on the stairs, and he looks up at what's on offer like a naughty schoolboy, fearfully grabbing her, her skin mottling and flushing, the old claims that there was real penetration on the set of Performance seem small beer: here, psyches are stripped. And soon the fever spread through the crew. </p> <p>\"Everybody was peeling themselves open,\" Roeg remembers. \"It was a wild time, there was a great feeling of release - sexually, emotionally. It was exhilarating. I remember one day we shot for 24 hours. I think I was the one who said, 'I can't take it any more. I've had enough.' We were shooting six or seven days a week. It was claustrophobic - play the part, go to sleep, go back. I abandoned control, and something magical came in. Bad Timing began to live itself. I kept out of the way of its forcefield. It was a bit of suspended time. A parallel universe.\" </p> <p>Everyone caught their breath when Garfunkel and Russell's characters took a break in Morocco. Shooting on the edge of the Sahara, they felt free, adventurous. But it was the calm before the storm - the long day, back in Vienna, spent filming the rape. It looks deeply uncomfortable - Russell's head hanging back from her bed, while Garfunkel tears her clothes with a penknife, and enters her over and over. Shooting it was \"shocking\", Roeg remembers. 'The actors were frightened when they realised the disgust you feel when you can't control yourself. It's an extraordinary, horrible crime, rape. And you don't often see the rape of the unconscious. Usually it's someone dragged screaming into the bushes. There's a lot of acting going on. There wasn't a lot of acting in that scene.\" </p> <p>After a break, some of the crew reassembled for a final scene in New York. But Garfunkel's performance was distant. They'd left their parallel universe and couldn't go back. Roeg scrapped the scene. But he began post-production thrilled at the work they'd done, sure audiences would recognise the characters' emotions. </p> <p>But, Roeg recalls, \"it was received for the most part very poorly.\" At the first test screening in America, I was going to meet a friend, a quite well-known actor. Afterwards, he got into his car, drove it at me, and swerved off. He wouldn't speak to me for three years. I didn't realise till then how seriously people resent you holding a mirror to their face.\" </p> <p>Keitel and Garfunkel became firm friends from the experience. Roeg and Russell returned to Bad Timing's themes in other undervalued work such as Cold Heaven (1993), in which Russell's half-dead, cuckolded husband recovers from the surgeon's scalpel to test their love. </p> <p>The dashed dreams they all had for Bad Timing 20 years ago still bond them. \"When Rank called it 'sick', it hurt,\" Roeg says. \"I was surprised and upset for the actors. No matter how much I said they were terrific, they didn't get the recognition they patently deserved. It doesn't help much, years later, when people say, 'Oh, that movie...\"'</p>",

Interfax news agency in Moscow quoted a Russian defence minister saying that a break in the weather would allow the rescuers to begin work bringing the men to the surface from the crippled nuclear submarine Kursk. No immediate details were available but any attempt is expected to involve a mini diving bell known as a Kolokol, capable of carrying 10-15 people back to the surface at a time. The Russian government has so far rejected help from Britain, which has offered to loan a mini-submarine and a remote controlled vehicle currently on stand-by at Glasgow airport. The Ministry of Defence said the equipment, complete with crews, could be deployed immediately to the Barents Sea, where the Kursk is lying 500ft down on the seabed. Earlier today, an official from Russia's northern fleet said all crew members of the stricken nuclear submarine, which lying 350ft underwater, are alive after Sunday's accident. Rescue teams had managed to communicate with the Kursk, with 116 sailors on board, using coded signals tapped out on the hull of the vessel. \"We have learned through tapping that there are no dead among the Kursk crew, but it remains unknown whether there are casualties,\" the spokesman said.

These students - 300,000 or so - will be measurably different from those who began their university lives a mere five years ago. This is a younger, more cosmopolitan crowd, more likely to study locally, and enrol on vocational degrees such as business studies or computing. And there is now an even bigger university gender gap: women make up the clear majority of new students. </p> <p>The changing characteristics of university entrants over the past five years is revealed in a statistical bulletin published by the universities and colleges admission service this week. Covering the years before and after the introduction of \u00a31,000-a-year means-tested fees and the loss of student maintenance support in 1997, it represents the first comprehensive analysis of the impact that scrapping free higher education has had on the full-time student population. Future comparisons will be muddied by the introduction of a broader set of exams for school leavers from this year onwards. </p> <p>The figures confirm earlier suggestions that the first clear casualties have been mature students. The numbers of students over 21 enrolling on degree courses grew steadily up to 1997, but have been falling ever since. There were 51,040 mature freshers in 1999, nearly 9,000 fewer than in 1997, bringing the population below the levels of 1994. </p> <p>The big political question, though - highlighted by Gordon Brown's attack on Oxford for turning away the comprehensive sixthformer Laura Spence, who subsequently went on to secure a place at Harvard - is how the government's fees policy is measuring up with its vows to make universities more socially inclusive. The figures can be interpreted and exploited both by those who favour fees and by those who oppose them. Economists have cited the continuing failure of universities to attract students from all backgrounds as one of the central arguments for allowing institutions to charge higher and more variable fees. The extra money raised, they argued in a report for the 20 elite Russell Group universities, could be used to fund scholarships for poorer students. </p> <p>The latest statistics remain inconclusive. University intakes of students with unskilled and partly skilled parents, for example, have increased by over 20% from 1994 to 1999. Fees do not appear to have had a large impact. Yet in terms of absolute numbers these groups continue to be dwarfed by enrolments from the managerial and professional classes. Much the biggest increase over the six years was in the second highest social grouping, up by 15,000 to 108,000 entrants in 1999 - over a third of all new students. </p> <p>The student population's social profile has in fact changed little in the past six years. Universities remain an enclave for the privileged and prosperous. Students from high-income families and suburbia made up more than a third of last year's full-time intake, even though those areas account for only about a fifth of the UK population as a whole. In contrast, people from council flats - nearly 7% of the UK population - made up less than 3% of the 1999 intake. </p> <p>A similar pattern exists for students from ethnic minorities. There was a 40% increase in the number of black applicants accepted to degree courses between 1994 and 1999, and a 53% increase among Asians. But despite the increases, black applicants accounted for only 3% cent of the total number accepted to degree courses in 1999, while Asians made up 9%. </p> <p>Arguably the most dramatic trend revealed by the figures is the ascendancy of women as the educationally superior sex. The university gender gap is widening every year. In 1994, women accounted for 50.7% of students accepted to degree courses, while men accounted for 49.3%. In 1999, women secured 53.7% of places while men took 46.3%. The emergence of female freshers as the majority of new students reflects stronger achievements throughout the education system. Women students are also less likely to drop out of degree courses than men. </p> <p>The figures show that women on average do not travel as far as men to go to university. Wealthier students, meanwhile, travel nearly three times as far on average as those from poorer backgrounds to get to their chosen university or college. </p> <p>Overall the modern student is now more likely to study near home - probably a result of the increasing financial burdens associated with university. The average distance travelled by students has dropped sharply over the past six years. In 1994, students from high-income families travelled an average of 83 miles to reach university or college. By 1999, the average was 74 miles - a drop of nearly 11%. Students from council flats travelled an average 36 miles in 1994, but only 28 miles in 1999 - a drop of nearly 23%. </p> <p>The demand for subjects such as social studies, business studies, mathematics and computing has increased steadily from 1994 to 1999, while subjects where numbers fell included physical sciences, engineering and architecture. </p> <p> Statistical Bulletin on Widening Participation, Edition 2000 can be ordered from UCAS Distribution on 01242 544610, \u00a315 per copy.

University intakes of students with unskilled and partly skilled parents, for example, have increased by over 20% from 1994 to 1999. Fees do not appear to have had a large impact. Yet in terms of absolute numbers these groups continue to be dwarfed by enrolments from the managerial and professional classes. Much the biggest increase over the six years was in the second highest social grouping, up by 15,000 to 108,000 entrants in 1999 - over a third of all new students. The student population's social profile has in fact changed little in the past six years. Universities remain an enclave for the privileged and prosperous. Students from high-income families and suburbia made up more than a third of last year's full-time intake, even though those areas account for only about a fifth of the UK population as a whole. In contrast, people from council flats - nearly 7% of the UK population - made up less than 3% of the 1999 intake. A similar pattern exists for students from ethnic minorities. There was a 40% increase in the number of black applicants accepted to degree courses between 1994 and 1999, and a 53% increase among Asians. But despite the increases, black applicants accounted for only 3% cent of the total number accepted to degree courses in 1999, while Asians made up 9%. Arguably the most dramatic trend revealed by the figures is the ascendancy of women as the educationally superior sex. The university gender gap is widening every year. In 1994, women accounted for 50.7% of students accepted to degree courses, while men accounted for 49.3%. In 1999, women secured 53.7% of places while men took 46.3%. The emergence of female freshers as the majority of new students reflects stronger achievements throughout the education system. Women students are also less likely to drop out of degree courses than men. The figures show that women on average do not travel as far as men to go to university. Wealthier students, meanwhile, travel nearly three times as far on average as those from poorer backgrounds to get to their chosen university or college. Overall the modern student is now more likely to study near home - probably a result of the increasing financial burdens associated with university. The average distance travelled by students has dropped sharply over the past six years. In 1994, students from high-income families travelled an average of 83 miles to reach university or college. By 1999, the average was 74 miles - a drop of nearly 11%. Students from council flats travelled an average 36 miles in 1994, but only 28 miles in 1999 - a drop of nearly 23%. The demand for subjects such as social studies, business studies, mathematics and computing has increased steadily from 1994 to 1999, while subjects where numbers fell included physical sciences, engineering and architecture.

BA said it had taken action after being told that the aircraft's certificate of airworthiness was about to be suspended. The decision comes after last month's Air France Concorde crash near Paris, which killed 113 people. The BA chief executive, Rod Eddington, said: \"BA's first concern is always safety. All our aircraft are subject to continuing and exhaustive safety checks. \"We have been in constant contact with the airworthiness authorities in the UK and France, the airframe and engine manufacturers and Air France throughout Concorde's flying life, and particularly closely since the accident in Paris last month. \"Since then, we implemented an extensive series of additional procedures and checks on the aircraft's airframe, engines, tyres and wheels, hydraulics and other systems and operating procedures, above and beyond Concorde's already demanding schedule of maintenance, inspections and operation parameters. \"The British CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] was in complete agreement with our decision to resume Concorde's services shortly after the Air France crash. \"We were notified this morning by the AAIB [air accident investigation branch] that, in the light of latest information available to it, it and its French counterparts, the BEA, would tomorrow recommend that the certificate of airworthiness for the aircraft should be suspended. \"We discussed this with the CAA and we understand that it would be minded to accept this advice.

Passengers on that flight and on the return BA002 from JFK were being transferred to alternative services. Passengers flying from Heathrow airport Terminal Four today greeted the decision to suspend all Concorde flights with mixed feelings. Andy Young, a 35-year-old chief financial officer flying to Cairo, who had previously flown by Concorde two years ago, said he was not surprised by the decision, believing that it would take a long time for Concorde to re-establish any kind of confidence with passengers. \"I wouldn't have gone on Concorde again after the crash in France,\" he said. It is not yet known exactly what was discovered by the AAIB and its French counterparts that would prompt BA to ground its supersonic fleet. But clearly the airline, despite all its checks and its confidence in the plane in the immediate aftermath of the crash, is now concerned enough to have made today's decision. Today's announcement could put an end to supersonic passenger travel, almost three decades after the Anglo-French project which developed what became the world's most famous aeroplane. The safety of British Airways' Concorde fleet has come under intense scrutiny in the weeks following last month's horrific Paris crash. Fears about the supersonic jet's airworthiness were fuelled by four worrying incidents aboard BA planes shortly after the tragedy. There were also concerns just days before the crash when tiny cracks were found in the wings of the aircraft - which had previously suffered no fatal accidents in 25 years' flying. One was taken out of service after the cracks in the rear wing spar grew from 60mm to 76mm in length, while the remaining six aircraft were ruled fit to fly. But in the aftermath of the crash at Gonesse the probe has largely focused on the aircraft's high-pressure tyres. French investigators believe the \"initial cause\" of the Air France accident on July 25 was a metal strip on the runway at Charles de Gaulle. It is thought it punctured a tyre, sending huge chunks of rubber into the area of the fuel tanks on the left-hand side of the plane. Jet fuel then poured out into the super-hot \"afterburner\" engine used for take-off, sending flames shooting from the back of the wing.

Since then, the investigation into the tragedy has led to a number of official announcements, and plenty of unofficial theories, about the cause of the accident. Last week investigators said a strip of metal found on the runway where the jet took off probably punctured a Concorde tyre, turning the rubber and metal mix into shrapnel which damaged one or several fuel tanks on the left wing, causing a fuel leak and fire. Earlier, New Scientist magazine claimed to have seen details of the study which said that some of these could lead to \"catastrophic problems\" - including uncontrolled fire and multiple engine failure.

      "body": "<p>Breasts epitomise femininity. Firm, heaving bosoms have through the ages inspired men to awe and poetry, and remain potent symbols of sex, nurturing and motherhood. At least, this is what you might think if you were an advertising executive, a Sun reader, or a 19th century Austrian psychoanalyst. In fact, for millions of British women, the reality of breast ownership is very different. For many, their breasts are little more than a source of tortuous pain; inescapable repositories of fear, loathing, lumps and confusion. </p> <p>Breast pain affects two-thirds of women at some stage in their lives, and is often much more than a few days of premenstrual discomfort. For many, sport is impossible, even with the sturdiest of sports bras. They may even find it difficult to walk without their arms crossed over the chest. They may avoid hugging their children, dread sex and live in fear of an accidental knock. For 15%, it interferes with sleep. </p> <p>Disappointingly, little medical progress has been made in this field since Astley Cooper, one of the leading surgeons of the 1800s, announced that breast pain was \"the result of a nervous disposition\". </p> <p>Today, with nearly all research into mammary glands focusing on finding a cure for breast cancer, hardly any funds are earmarked for investigating breast pain. This may explain why there is no treatment available apart from paracetamol, evening primrose oil (how many other cripplingly painful conditions are treated with a vegetable oil?) or hormone treatments which can get rid of the pain but at the cost of gaining a deeper voice and facial hair. </p> <p>Denise Wellbeloved, from Cardiff, suffers pain for three weeks out of every four. \"There were times of the month when I just stayed home and cried,\" she says. \"The pain got so bad that some days I just had to lie in the bath for hours on end. It affected my work, my home life and my sex life. Sometimes I couldn't bear my husband to come near me.\" </p> <p>Denise was initially told it was \"perfectly normal for a woman to have pain in her breasts\". She now has it somewhat under control with high doses of evening primrose oil. Dr Eleanor Clarke, an adviser to the Breast Care Campaign, says: \"Unfortunately, there are still very many things we don't understand about benign breast disease.\" She adds that if it was a condition that affected men: \"We might well have got a lot further by now.\" </p> <p>The problem with breasts is that, more than any other organ, they are constantly changing. Age, stages of the month, pregnancy, weaning and menopause give rise to an alarming variety of lumps, bumps, pains and swellings, all of which can be normal. </p> <p>With confusion reigning even among the experts, it's hardly surprising that some women are too frightened even to approach a doctor, or to examine themselves every month, which is recommended. Even if they get to hospital and cancer is ruled out, they will be sent home, often still confused and worried about their inexplicable pain. </p> <p>\"So few women really know what normal is, that it can lead to a lot of unnecessary anxiety,\" says breast-care nurse Nikki West who works at the University of Wales college of medicine in Cardiff. She urges women to become more \"breast aware\", adding: \"Women should be giving their breasts the same care and attention as their face, hair and skin.\" </p> <p>Clarke says: \"The first thing that women with pain think of is cancer, and this fear is often magnified by the media. Appointments with consultants doubled in the fortnight after Linda McCartney died of breast cancer, and at present in the Radio 4 soap opera, The Archers, for example, there is a 32-year-old character with breast cancer. The chances of a woman that young really getting cancer are tiny.\" </p> <p>The fear factor is well illustrated by a survey Clarke carried out at her own surgery in Chorley Wood, Hertfordshire. \"I saw 137 women in one year who were concerned about their breasts,\" she says. \"Sixty per cent of them had pain but, in the end, only one had cancer. Pain alone is a very uncommon symptom of cancer.\" </p> <p>Breast pain, nearly always benign, can be cyclical or non-cyclical. Cyclical pain is by far the most common, and is thought to be caused by an abnormal sensitivity of the breast tissue to normal levels of hormones, which build up the milk-producing tissue each month after ovulation, and then fall rapidly when the period starts. This sensitivity is linked to low levels of a fatty acid called gamolenic acid (GLA), which governs the body's responses to its own hormones. Levels are rarely low because of any dietary deficiency, but due to inefficient conversion processes in the body. Non-cyclical pain is often more worrying. Constant pain, usually described as burning, pricking or stabbing - especially if it is in only one breast or in a woman over 35 - can unsurprisingly give rise to fear, sometimes more debilitating than the pain itself. It is most likely, however, to be caused by a cyst, bad posture, or strain or injury of the ribs or muscles of the chest wall. </p> <p>Ill-fitting bras could be another cause. According to Marks &amp; Spencer, up to 60% of British women are wearing the wrong size bra. Women often continue to buy the same size throughout their lives, even though the shape and size of their breasts can change significantly. Either kind of pain can start at any time, and can be just as bad in totally flat-chested women as in a size 44DD. Clarke says: \"It seems to start often in the 20s and 30s, and could be to do with weight or lifestyle change, or having babies.\" </p> <p>She says it may also be linked to eating fatty foods, caffeine and stress - although pain afflicts plenty of yogically calm vegetarians who never touch coffee or Coca-Cola. Cruelly, chocolate, most women's solution to PMS, may also be a cause. </p> <p>The best treatment for benign breast pain is evening primrose oil, which can help in up to 70% of women. However, the amounts in health food supplements (around 15mg) are nowhere near enough to have any effect. Large quantities are needed - around 320mg per day - and these are available only in prescription preparations such as Efamast and Epogam. Further, it must be taken for at least three months before it has any benefit. After this time, the supplements often seem to help the body \"click back\" to normal, with the pain disappearing and no need for further supplements. </p> <p>The other treatments are synthetic \"anti-hormones\", which work quickly - but can have unpleasant side effects. Danazol usually relieves pain within the first cycle, but can cause nausea, greasy skin, weight gain and deepening of the voice in up to a third of women. Bromocriptine can cause dizziness, nausea or constipation. Neither can be used at the same time as the contraceptive pill. </p> <p>Clarke says: \"These are not nice drugs, and a GP will rarely give them without a consultant's opinion. In my 30 years of practice I have never prescribed Bromocriptine, and Danazol only twice.\" </p> <p>Other past suggestions have been categorically shown to have no effect. These include antibiotics, diuretics (the pain is not caused by fluid retention), progesterone suppositories and vitamin B6 tablets. </p> <p><strong>Breasts: the facts</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Each breast contains 15-20 clusters of glands designed to produce milk. Channels from each of these join together, rather like a bunch of grapes, and each cluster has a main duct which opens at the nipple. The glands are embedded in fatty tissue which gives the breasts their individual shape. </p> <p>\u0095 Breast pain is known as mastalgia. Mastitis is inflammation, usually due to infection, and is most common during breastfeeding and pregnancy. It may also be caused by smoking, and if untreated can go on to form abcesses. </p> <p>\u0095 Pregnancy will stop cyclical breast pain because the periods have stopped, although it often brings its own aches and pains as the breasts grow and swell from early on in the pregnancy, especially during breast-feeding. </p> <p>\u0095 Similarly, the pill may (but not always) reduce pain.

      "bodyText": "Breasts epitomise femininity. Firm, heaving bosoms have through the ages inspired men to awe and poetry, and remain potent symbols of sex, nurturing and motherhood. At least, this is what you might think if you were an advertising executive, a Sun reader, or a 19th century Austrian psychoanalyst. In fact, for millions of British women, the reality of breast ownership is very different. For many, their breasts are little more than a source of tortuous pain; inescapable repositories of fear, loathing, lumps and confusion. Breast pain affects two-thirds of women at some stage in their lives, and is often much more than a few days of premenstrual discomfort. For many, sport is impossible, even with the sturdiest of sports bras. They may even find it difficult to walk without their arms crossed over the chest. They may avoid hugging their children, dread sex and live in fear of an accidental knock. For 15%, it interferes with sleep. Disappointingly, little medical progress has been made in this field since Astley Cooper, one of the leading surgeons of the 1800s, announced that breast pain was \"the result of a nervous disposition\". Today, with nearly all research into mammary glands focusing on finding a cure for breast cancer, hardly any funds are earmarked for investigating breast pain. This may explain why there is no treatment available apart from paracetamol, evening primrose oil (how many other cripplingly painful conditions are treated with a vegetable oil?) or hormone treatments which can get rid of the pain but at the cost of gaining a deeper voice and facial hair. Denise Wellbeloved, from Cardiff, suffers pain for three weeks out of every four. \"There were times of the month when I just stayed home and cried,\" she says. \"The pain got so bad that some days I just had to lie in the bath for hours on end. It affected my work, my home life and my sex life. Sometimes I couldn't bear my husband to come near me.\" Denise was initially told it was \"perfectly normal for a woman to have pain in her breasts\". She now has it somewhat under control with high doses of evening primrose oil. Dr Eleanor Clarke, an adviser to the Breast Care Campaign, says: \"Unfortunately, there are still very many things we don't understand about benign breast disease.\" She adds that if it was a condition that affected men: \"We might well have got a lot further by now.\" The problem with breasts is that, more than any other organ, they are constantly changing. Age, stages of the month, pregnancy, weaning and menopause give rise to an alarming variety of lumps, bumps, pains and swellings, all of which can be normal. With confusion reigning even among the experts, it's hardly surprising that some women are too frightened even to approach a doctor, or to examine themselves every month, which is recommended. Even if they get to hospital and cancer is ruled out, they will be sent home, often still confused and worried about their inexplicable pain. \"So few women really know what normal is, that it can lead to a lot of unnecessary anxiety,\" says breast-care nurse Nikki West who works at the University of Wales college of medicine in Cardiff. She urges women to become more \"breast aware\", adding: \"Women should be giving their breasts the same care and attention as their face, hair and skin.\" Clarke says: \"The first thing that women with pain think of is cancer, and this fear is often magnified by the media. Appointments with consultants doubled in the fortnight after Linda McCartney died of breast cancer, and at present in the Radio 4 soap opera, The Archers, for example, there is a 32-year-old character with breast cancer. The chances of a woman that young really getting cancer are tiny.\" The fear factor is well illustrated by a survey Clarke carried out at her own surgery in Chorley Wood, Hertfordshire. \"I saw 137 women in one year who were concerned about their breasts,\" she says. \"Sixty per cent of them had pain but, in the end, only one had cancer. Pain alone is a very uncommon symptom of cancer.\" Breast pain, nearly always benign, can be cyclical or non-cyclical. Cyclical pain is by far the most common, and is thought to be caused by an abnormal sensitivity of the breast tissue to normal levels of hormones, which build up the milk-producing tissue each month after ovulation, and then fall rapidly when the period starts. This sensitivity is linked to low levels of a fatty acid called gamolenic acid (GLA), which governs the body's responses to its own hormones. Levels are rarely low because of any dietary deficiency, but due to inefficient conversion processes in the body. Non-cyclical pain is often more worrying. Constant pain, usually described as burning, pricking or stabbing - especially if it is in only one breast or in a woman over 35 - can unsurprisingly give rise to fear, sometimes more debilitating than the pain itself. It is most likely, however, to be caused by a cyst, bad posture, or strain or injury of the ribs or muscles of the chest wall. Ill-fitting bras could be another cause. According to Marks &amp; Spencer, up to 60% of British women are wearing the wrong size bra. Women often continue to buy the same size throughout their lives, even though the shape and size of their breasts can change significantly. Either kind of pain can start at any time, and can be just as bad in totally flat-chested women as in a size 44DD. Clarke says: \"It seems to start often in the 20s and 30s, and could be to do with weight or lifestyle change, or having babies.\" She says it may also be linked to eating fatty foods, caffeine and stress - although pain afflicts plenty of yogically calm vegetarians who never touch coffee or Coca-Cola. Cruelly, chocolate, most women's solution to PMS, may also be a cause. The best treatment for benign breast pain is evening primrose oil, which can help in up to 70% of women. However, the amounts in health food supplements (around 15mg) are nowhere near enough to have any effect. Large quantities are needed - around 320mg per day - and these are available only in prescription preparations such as Efamast and Epogam. Further, it must be taken for at least three months before it has any benefit. After this time, the supplements often seem to help the body \"click back\" to normal, with the pain disappearing and no need for further supplements. The other treatments are synthetic \"anti-hormones\", which work quickly - but can have unpleasant side effects. Danazol usually relieves pain within the first cycle, but can cause nausea, greasy skin, weight gain and deepening of the voice in up to a third of women. Bromocriptine can cause dizziness, nausea or constipation. Neither can be used at the same time as the contraceptive pill. Clarke says: \"These are not nice drugs, and a GP will rarely give them without a consultant's opinion. In my 30 years of practice I have never prescribed Bromocriptine, and Danazol only twice.\" Other past suggestions have been categorically shown to have no effect. These include antibiotics, diuretics (the pain is not caused by fluid retention), progesterone suppositories and vitamin B6 tablets. Breasts: the facts \u0095 Each breast contains 15-20 clusters of glands designed to produce milk. Channels from each of these join together, rather like a bunch of grapes, and each cluster has a main duct which opens at the nipple. The glands are embedded in fatty tissue which gives the breasts their individual shape. \u0095 Breast pain is known as mastalgia. Mastitis is inflammation, usually due to infection, and is most common during breastfeeding and pregnancy. It may also be caused by smoking, and if untreated can go on to form abcesses. \u0095 Pregnancy will stop cyclical breast pain because the periods have stopped, although it often brings its own aches and pains as the breasts grow and swell from early on in the pregnancy, especially during breast-feeding. \u0095 Similarly, the pill may (but not always) reduce pain. Not recommended solely as a means of controlling breast pain. \u0095 Nipple disorders include eczema, which can be treated with moisturisers or steroid creams, polyps and cysts which can be surgically removed, and duct estasia, where the ducts close to the nipple dilate because of blockages and fill with thick fluid. Symptoms are a hot, red, swollen breast and possibly a retracted nipple. \u0095 Fibroadenomas are firm, pain less nodules of fibrous tissue which usually occur in young women and may enlarge during pregnancy. They tend to disappear without treatment. \u0095 Cysts, most common in women in their 40s and 50s, are fluid-filled sacs which often appear suddenly, causing a lot of pain. There may be several in one or both breasts. They may disappear on their own, or a doctor may draw off the fluid with a hypodermic needle. \u0095 Some women have generally knobbly breasts, a condition known as diffuse nodularity, which can occur at any age. \u0095One in 12 British women gets breast cancer, but this is a lifetime risk. You're most likely to develop it after the menopause, and until then the risk is less than one in 100.

When I tell Rebecca, she launches into her beloved Socratic mode. \"What time did you get up?\" she begins. \"Just after 5am.\" \"Why?\" \"To drive here from London.\" \"And how long did that take?\" My patience is thinning, but a caustic glance thickens it up. \"Five and a half hours,\" I answer. \"In a big, comfortable car?\" \"No, a small, extremely cramped one.\" She pauses in the portentous manner of a leading silk poised to ask the killer question. \"So then,\" she resumes, \"why do you think you are tired with backache and a stiff neck?\" \"Hodgkin's disease?\" Remembering that nothing in this rented cottage is ours, she thinks better of assaulting the crockery and heads for the bedroom. </p> <p><strong> Saturday</strong> </p> <p> This, the only full day of my annual holiday, is spent sheltering from driving rain under a parasol in Torquay, eating fish and chips that might have been more effectively deployed in biological warfare. What I really need now, I reflect as we drive home across Dartmoor, is a fortnight's health tourism - in a French hospital, ideally, having tests on my blood, kidney, colon, brain and testes. </p> <p><strong> Sunday </strong></p> <p> Back in London, I am overwhelmed by profound fatigue. It could mean anything from too much Jack Daniels or a nameless virus all the way to acute myeloid leukemia. Since I have no coherent set of symptoms, my physician Sarah Jarvis would doubtless advise less drinking, proper eating, exercise, etc, rather than refer me. But what I want is a blood test, and it occurs to me that going abroad may be the only way to get one. </p> <p><strong> Monday </strong></p> <p> \"Haematology, g'day. How may I help?\" It is late Monday night in London, but early Tuesday morning in Australia when I get through to a Sydney teaching hospital. \"Ah yes, a very good day to you too. I'm a health tourist from England coming over next month for the Olympics, and I'd like to book a blood test.\" \"I'm sorry I don't understand. Health tourist?\" Briefly, I outline the concept, and the perplexed-sounding young woman says she needs to transfer me. The phone rings again. \"Psychiatric out patients, g'day. How may I help?\" I replace the receiver, and reflecting that this health tourism lark isn't as easy as it sounds, I make a mental note to call Thomas Cook's medical department and retire disconsolately to bed.</p>",

When I tell Rebecca, she launches into her beloved Socratic mode. \"What time did you get up?\" she begins. \"Just after 5am.\" \"Why?\" \"To drive here from London.\" \"And how long did that take?\" My patience is thinning, but a caustic glance thickens it up. \"Five and a half hours,\" I answer. \"In a big, comfortable car?\" \"No, a small, extremely cramped one.\" She pauses in the portentous manner of a leading silk poised to ask the killer question. \"So then,\" she resumes, \"why do you think you are tired with backache and a stiff neck?\" \"Hodgkin's disease?\" Remembering that nothing in this rented cottage is ours, she thinks better of assaulting the crockery and heads for the bedroom. Saturday This, the only full day of my annual holiday, is spent sheltering from driving rain under a parasol in Torquay, eating fish and chips that might have been more effectively deployed in biological warfare. What I really need now, I reflect as we drive home across Dartmoor, is a fortnight's health tourism - in a French hospital, ideally, having tests on my blood, kidney, colon, brain and testes. Sunday Back in London, I am overwhelmed by profound fatigue. It could mean anything from too much Jack Daniels or a nameless virus all the way to acute myeloid leukemia. Since I have no coherent set of symptoms, my physician Sarah Jarvis would doubtless advise less drinking, proper eating, exercise, etc, rather than refer me. But what I want is a blood test, and it occurs to me that going abroad may be the only way to get one. Monday \"Haematology, g'day. How may I help?\" It is late Monday night in London, but early Tuesday morning in Australia when I get through to a Sydney teaching hospital. \"Ah yes, a very good day to you too. I'm a health tourist from England coming over next month for the Olympics, and I'd like to book a blood test.\" \"I'm sorry I don't understand. Health tourist?\" Briefly, I outline the concept, and the perplexed-sounding young woman says she needs to transfer me. The phone rings again. \"Psychiatric out patients, g'day. How may I help?\" I replace the receiver, and reflecting that this health tourism lark isn't as easy as it sounds, I make a mental note to call Thomas Cook's medical department and retire disconsolately to bed.",

Anyway, while I'm feeling bitter, here's a list of the things Georgia has so far copied from me!! CREAM rotary phone, PANASONIC walkman, her new love of candles, religious imagery, ROBOCOP (!!) Rocky Horror, Elvis and his tacky ways. Priscilla, CULTURE CLUB!! (I got a photo, signed to no-one, sent to me recently), colours, my favourites green, orange and blue, cosmetics, Cosmetics To Go, silver jewellery. She even wanted some bike boots (I successfully got some in Camden). NO SHAME. That's all I can remember for now. I will eventually write about London and explain the Savoy/Fortnum receipts opposite. So much has happened and psychotherapy is a total mind FUCK!! I'm psychotic!! (and suicidal). </p> <p> This entry was the last ever in Simon Hervey's diary. He died, sitting up in bed in his small flat in Newcastle, on March 8 last year. He had a book on his lap, and a crisp packet by his side; there were still crisps in his mouth. At the inquest six months later, the coroner recorded an open verdict. \"Open in the sense that one simply does not know what happened,\" he said. </p> <p>Simon was just 28. For 14 of those 28 years, he was prescribed a cocktail of drugs by a variety of doctors. The first prescription for Valium was because he was unhappy about being bullied at school and because he was concerned about his acne. Between then and his death he was put on uppers, downers, more benzodiazepines (the drug group to which Valium belongs), Prozac, Heminevrin, normally given under hospital conditions to alcoholics, and finally Epilim, an anti-epileptic. </p> <p> <strong> The year summed up: 1992.</strong> </p> <p> \"In 1991, September 18, my Grandma C died and I found out by accident on Jan 10, '92 from a phone call to Grandad. Thanks Mum, I never knew her, thanks to you... I've now been sick with depression for four years and it's going to come to a head. Valium is not enough, nor is librium. I've had every antidepressant going and none of them work.\" </p> <p> Simon died alone. The evening before, he had rung his father Adrian Hervey, 58, who works at an all-night garage, and asked him to drop by with some chocolate on his way home. Adrian recalls seeing Simon with the book and crisp packet. \"I chatted to him for a while and then realised something had happened. I called an ambulance but I knew he was dead,\" he says. </p> <p>Simon was flamboyantly gay; he was clever and artistic. In his Newcastle flat, he dreamed of fame and fortune. In his diary, he has left a record of those dreams and of his descent into depression, and into drug-induced confusion; his battle with alcohol and his longing to leave the city. The diaries, from 1990 until that final entry nine years later, are brutal, yet often written with warmth, wit and lucidity. And on virtually every page is a cry for help. I never knew him but I feel that I did; for anyone who has read his diaries, there is an enormous sense of loss. </p> <p>Adrian Hervey's wife left when Simon was eight, leaving Adrian to bring up his son. Now he is alone - bewildered, grieving and proud. Pictures of Simon cover the walls in his high-rise flat in the centre of Newcastle: Simon as Boy George, made-up eyes and high cheekbones; Simon outside the Pompidou Centre in Paris, looking gleefully wicked in one picture and as innocent as a choir boy in another. Simon was a chameleon and he was deeply, deeply unhappy. </p> <p>I met Adrian Hervey six months after Simon died, while reporting on the NHS complaints system for Channel 4 News. I was looking at what kind of redress people have when something has gone wrong. In Hervey's case he wanted to know why Simon had been prescribed this cocktail of drugs for so long. And why he had been given repeat prescriptions of drugs such as Valium which is supposed to be prescribed only in the short term, with the patient seen regularly by the doctor. </p> <p>Adrian was beginning to contemplate the complaints process. Should he demand to see Simon's notes from the hospital and the GP? Should he sue? Like all parents whose children die before they do, he needed some answers because he felt the system had failed his son. </p> <p>\"My son died unnecessarily,\" Adrian says. \"There was a crass lack of care. In any other country in the world he would have been put in hospital and got off those drugs.\" According to Adrian, Simon had begun to fall over, crash into furniture and black out shortly before he died. The coroner noted the bruising on his body and acknowledged Adrian's evidence that his son had begun to lose his coordination. </p> <p>Peter Cooper, the pathologist who gave evidence at the inquest, said that there were benzodiazepines, Heminevrin and co-proxomol in his blood as well as of Epilim, all at a therapeutic dosage level. There were no empty pill bottles or packets in his flat to indicate this might have been suicide. </p> <p>\"He was looking for help all the time, desperately,\" says Adrian. \"The effect of the benzodiazepine is to make the person dependent. He screamed to be off them. He tried to get help from doctors but, every time, he would come back with another drug. He lost his self-esteem, his self- confidence.\" </p> <p>Simon tried to kill himself three or four times during the 14 years that he was ill. Adrian believes that each incident was a cry for help. \"He knew that if he got to hospital he would get hands-on care,\" he says. </p> <p> <strong> November 2 1993</strong> </p> <p> \"I can't think of any more reasons to live, I disgust myself. I mistrust others and make life difficult for my father... I will never have what I want - I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WANT. I'm thick, my grammar is awful and I'm just plain tired of being ashamed of myself. I'm fat, ugly, spotty and obnoxious.

I feel like shit.\" </p> <p> <strong> March 8 1994</strong> </p> <p> \"Invest my sexual energy. IN WHOM? That's what I want to know!! ... My shrink told me this bizarre piece of nonsense this afternoon... I think my craziness is beyond help and that I will inevitably end my own life.\" </p> <p> <strong> November 19 1995</strong> </p> <p> \"I'm so frightened of living, I hide in bed all day... And yet I'm so preoccupied with the thought that it may improve of its own accord, of course, that I haven't the guts to end the farce... My head aches.

But in 1999 he appeared to rally. On the front page of his diary he has stuck a card, saying: \"New Year Same Shit.\" But on the next page is a map of the London Underground, in preparation for a visit to the capital, and pictures of orchids. He made that trip, between January 29 and February 1. There is a picture of the hotel he stayed in and, finally, on the last entry but one, a receipt from the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel, for a packet of Malboro Light cigarettes and, from Fortnum and Mason, for one Welsh rarebit and a glass of Guinness. We do not know how the visit went, despite his promise to write about it. </p> <p>They played Boy George's Church of the Poison Mind at Simon's funeral. He had made a tape in case one of his suicide attempts worked. Is that what finally happened? </p> <p>Adrian is still trying to find out whether the drugs his son was prescribed could, in combination, have killed him.

However, ORT public television said experts feared the hatches had been damaged in the collision. Nor was it clear last night whether the Kursk had been fitted with escape capsules.</p> <p>It is not inconceivable that the sailors could climb into the torpedo tubes, rocket out of the vessel and float safely to the surface, experts said, noting that British submariners have escaped in 185 metres of water during training exercises. However, Jim Jenkin, a Royal Navy spokesman, said it had never been tried for real. \"Their escape facility may be nothing like ours,\" he added.</p> <p>Last night, naval analysts agreed that the collision theory was the most plausible because the submarine was on the sea bed with its nuclear reactors idled, suggesting that the accident had happened very quickly. The submarine's commanders would normally surface before switching off the reactors if at all possible.</p> <p>The Pentagon said that a surface electronic surveillance ship had been monitoring the exercise but declared that it had \"no indication\" that any of its vessels were involved in the accident.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence insisted there were no British submarines in the area. A Royal Navy spokesman added: \"Any request for help would be met extremely favourably.\"</p> <p>The Royal Navy has an LR5 mini-submarine, on lease from a private company, but it is not clear whether it would be compatible with Russian technology.</p> <p>The Kursk, commissioned in 1994 and capable of carrying 24 cruise missiles and four torpedoes, was on the final day of exercises on Sunday when the disaster struck. The manoeuvres involved dozens of ships, submarines, and aircraft commanded from Murmansk and the nearby naval base of Severomorsk.</p> <p>Russian officials insisted yesterday that there were no nuclear weapons on board the stricken submarine. However, in previous accidents the Russian navy has also issued such denials and later admitted missiles had been on board.</p> <p>Another suggested cause for the accident was a flood in the front of the submarine when hatches failed to close during firing practice. However, a Russian navy spokesman dismissed this theory.</p> <p>While Norway, which also borders on the Barents sea, convened a crisis committee to monitor the accident, western anti-nuclear campaigners warned of a radiation disaster.</p> <p>If the submarine is flooded and sunk, its total weight could be more than 30,000 tonnes. The Russians do not have the engineering equipment to raise such a weight, experts said.</p> <p>Greenpeace, which says there have been more than 120 accidents in the Russian and Soviet nuclear submarine fleets in the past 40 years, said the disaster illustrated the hazards posed by all nuclear submarines.</p> <p>The Kursk is believed to be the seventh nuclear submarine to sink; two were American, the rest Soviet or Russian.</p> <p>Alexander Nikitin, an environmentalist and former Russian navy officer who was tried for spying after he blew the whistle on Russian nuclear leaks in the far north, said the depth of the sinking would make it nigh impossible to raise the stricken vessel. He said there were no emergency escape capsules for the crew.</p> <p>Other Russian experts contested this, stating that the Kursk is fitted with escape capsules and that crew members could also try to escape through the torpedo tubes and swim to the surface, though this was dangerous.</p>",

Senior Russian navy officers said the sinking might have been caused by a collision with a foreign vessel and suggested there would be casualties. The Oscar-II class Kursk submarine, powered by two nuclear reactors, was lying between 100 and 150m (330-490ft) below the surface of the Barents Sea, more than 100 miles north of the Russian port of Murmansk. When the accident happened, the Kursk, the flagship of Russia's northern fleet, was on manoeuvres as part of the country's biggest naval exercises in the Arctic for years. While western environmentalists speculated on whether radiation could leak from the 14,000-tonne submarine, Russia's navy chief said the accident was probably caused by a collision at sea and that the salvage prospects were not good. \"The signs are of a major and serious collision,\" said Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov. \"I can not yet say what the submarine collided with. The situation is difficult and the chances of a favourable outcome are not very high.\" There has been speculation in Moscow that the submarine collided with a foreign surveillance vessel, possibly from Nato, which was observing the three days of manoeuvres. Such remarks suggested that the submarine sinking could yet turn into a major international incident. By last night a nuclear missile cruiser, Peter the Great, a patrol boat, another large ship and five rescue boats were on the scene. An aircraft carrier was providing a base for fleets of helicopters. A submersible craft surveyed the damage to the vessel, which included damage to the bow, hull, and conning tower. One of the craft was also said to be supplying the crippled vessel with fuel and oxygen for the 107 trapped crew members. The Russian navy press office said that there had been no casualties but other navy sources in the northern fleet headquarters in Murmansk told Interfax news agency that there had been some deaths.

However, ORT public television said experts feared the hatches had been damaged in the collision. Nor was it clear last night whether the Kursk had been fitted with escape capsules. It is not inconceivable that the sailors could climb into the torpedo tubes, rocket out of the vessel and float safely to the surface, experts said, noting that British submariners have escaped in 185 metres of water during training exercises. However, Jim Jenkin, a Royal Navy spokesman, said it had never been tried for real. \"Their escape facility may be nothing like ours,\" he added. Last night, naval analysts agreed that the collision theory was the most plausible because the submarine was on the sea bed with its nuclear reactors idled, suggesting that the accident had happened very quickly. The submarine's commanders would normally surface before switching off the reactors if at all possible. The Pentagon said that a surface electronic surveillance ship had been monitoring the exercise but declared that it had \"no indication\" that any of its vessels were involved in the accident. The Ministry of Defence insisted there were no British submarines in the area. A Royal Navy spokesman added: \"Any request for help would be met extremely favourably.\" The Royal Navy has an LR5 mini-submarine, on lease from a private company, but it is not clear whether it would be compatible with Russian technology. The Kursk, commissioned in 1994 and capable of carrying 24 cruise missiles and four torpedoes, was on the final day of exercises on Sunday when the disaster struck. The manoeuvres involved dozens of ships, submarines, and aircraft commanded from Murmansk and the nearby naval base of Severomorsk. Russian officials insisted yesterday that there were no nuclear weapons on board the stricken submarine. However, in previous accidents the Russian navy has also issued such denials and later admitted missiles had been on board. Another suggested cause for the accident was a flood in the front of the submarine when hatches failed to close during firing practice. However, a Russian navy spokesman dismissed this theory. While Norway, which also borders on the Barents sea, convened a crisis committee to monitor the accident, western anti-nuclear campaigners warned of a radiation disaster. If the submarine is flooded and sunk, its total weight could be more than 30,000 tonnes. The Russians do not have the engineering equipment to raise such a weight, experts said. Greenpeace, which says there have been more than 120 accidents in the Russian and Soviet nuclear submarine fleets in the past 40 years, said the disaster illustrated the hazards posed by all nuclear submarines. The Kursk is believed to be the seventh nuclear submarine to sink; two were American, the rest Soviet or Russian. Alexander Nikitin, an environmentalist and former Russian navy officer who was tried for spying after he blew the whistle on Russian nuclear leaks in the far north, said the depth of the sinking would make it nigh impossible to raise the stricken vessel. He said there were no emergency escape capsules for the crew. Other Russian experts contested this, stating that the Kursk is fitted with escape capsules and that crew members could also try to escape through the torpedo tubes and swim to the surface, though this was dangerous.",

The star has said he's no longer interested in the action genre, and isn't too keen for the public to see him jumping around either. He explained that film bosses \"want me to have Dirty Harry retired and on a fishing trip where he suddenly becomes involved in a murder investigation\". But he doesn't want \"to go back and imitate myself. I have no desire to do the kind of action movies I did in the 1970s and 80s I don't think I could do that very well any more and, frankly, I don't think anybody would really want to see me trying.\" \u0095 Gwyneth Paltrow has turned her attention to singing and has recorded three songs for the soundtrack of her latest film Duets (see our earlier story). Paltrow joined with co-star Huey Lewis to record her own versions of Crusin', Just My Imagination and Bette Davis Eyes. Rarely one to hide her light under a bushel, Paltrow reckons she has a good voice: \"My mother and I would always sing and harmonise together. I was three years old and imitating her jazz singing. I was singing a Sesame Street song and I would put this spin on it and it was hilarious.\" \u0095 Meanwhile, Paltrow's ex-squeeze Ben Affleck is in final negotiations to star in the thriller Changing Lanes.

Swine fever is spread by direct contact between animals, through secretions, excretion, semen or blood. It can also be carried between pigs by vets and pig traders. Indirect contact through pig pens, vehicles, clothes and vets' instruments can also be to blame. </p> <p><b>Can it be stopped? </b><br> The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food hopes that slaughtering all pigs from original breeding units will stop the outbreak. Six thousand animals have already been slaughtered in East Anglia and another 10,000 are set for destruction.

But the Pig Vetinary Society is sceptical, warning that the large bird, deer and fox populations in East Anglia may spread the virus further.

The supermarket chain Asda has threatened to remove Belgian pate from its shelves if the European embargo is extended to cover all pork products and is not reviewed at the end of the month.</p> <p><b>Should we stop eating pork? </b><br> No. Scientists say bacon, sausages and other pork products do not transmit the virus to meat-eaters. In any case, swine fever is considered harmless to humans. Nick Sheldon of the National Pig Association said the Asda chain had confused the issue by threatening to remove Belgian pate from its shelves as a retaliation for any ban by Belgium on British pork products. He said it was unlikely that British pork products would be banned and Asda should not draw comparisons with the severity of Belgium's dioxin food last year. \"That was a public health matter,\" he said. \"This swine fever in pigs is a matter for the pigs and the pig farmers, but it's not a human health issue.\"</p> <p> <b>Is swine fever a new disease? </b><br> No, but this is the most severe outbreak in Britain in 30 years, and the first one here in 14 years.

Swine fever occurs in much of Asia, Central and South America and parts of Europe and Africa, but many countries are totally free of it.</p> <p><b>Will farmers be badly affected? </b><br> Yes, the enforced slaughtering and the EC ban could not come at a worse time for pig farmers, who are already struggling against low prices and cheap imports. Under the policy of compulsory slaughter of pigs, farmers receive 50% of the market value for infected animals, nothing for dead stock and 100% for uninfected pigs. There is no compensation for loss of income or slaughter costs. Tim Yeo, shadow agriculture minister, has argued that the EC should compensate pig farmers for the ban. </p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/food\">Special report: what's wrong with our food?</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 82 years after the Bolsheviks murdered the last Russian tsar with a bullet in the head, Nicholas II was canonised last night by the Russian Orthodox church. Making a saint of the autocrat whose 21 years of misrule spanned two lost wars and two revolutionary uprisings, and contributed hugely to the victory of communism in 1917, is controversial and divisive. Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their five children were killed in July 1918 in the basement of a house in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, Boris Yeltsin's power base. All seven were proclaimed Orthodox martyrs and saints at the assembly of bishops' millennium meeting in the newly restored Christ the Saviour Cathedral near the Kremlin in Moscow. Another 1,100 Christians persecuted during 70 years of communist rule became saints, making this by far the biggest mass canonisation ever held. The nearest equivalent was in the mid-16th century when 39 Orthodox saints were canonised in a single session. Nicholas is as much reviled in Russia as he is revered by the Orthodox faithful, and the arguments over whether he should be canonised have been raging for years. Highlighting the delicacy of the issue the head of the church, Patriarch Alexei, told the assembly that the canonisation could cause a split. \"There are different opinions in the church as to whether to attach the tsar's family to the assembly of saints,\" he conceded. The debate had to be especially thorough, \"so that making a decision will not cause dangerous schisms in our community\". In canonising the imperial family, the church hierarchy was anxious to stress that it was not endorsing Nicholas's record as tsar or making a political judgment, though that argument was dismissed as nonsensical by critics. \"In the last Russian Orthodox monarch and his family, we see people who sincerely tried to carry out the commandments of the gospels,\" said the proclamation, which was agreed unanimously. \"The light of all-conquering Christian faith was seen in the suffering the royal family endured during their incarceration with gentleness, patience, and humility, and in their martyr deaths.\" Nicholas, Alexandra and the children, Alexei, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia, were canonised as \"passion-bearers\", the lowest category of Orthodox sainthood, because of the humility and forbearance they showed in accepting their deaths at the hands of 11 Bolshevik gunmen in the early hours of July 17 1918. \"What! What!\" were said to be the tsar's final words on being told by Yakov Yurovski, the local Bolshevik secret policeman who led the firing squad, that he was to be shot. The seven Romanovs and four servants were shot at point-blank range, ushering in the Red Terror. The sole survivor was Joy, the imperial spaniel. \"Nine out of 10 of the virulent advocates of canonisation are people who are convinced that Nicholas II was ritually killed by Jews as part of a global conspiracy,\" commented a church analyst, Alexander Morozov. The Moscow theology professor Alexei Osipov said there were absolutely no grounds for canonising the Romanovs, particularly as, unlike the thousands of religious victims of communist persecution, they did not die for their faith. \"[Nicholas] suffered not for his Christian convictions but as a political figure,\" he said.

The 45-year-old career navy officer and submarine commander has dedicated his adult life, 22 years, to the northern fleet, advancing through the ranks, being decorated a couple of times, and taking charge of the Kursk, the five-year-old nuclear-powered Oscar-II class submarine based in Zapadnaya Litsa, close to Murmansk.</p> <p>The Kursk is the flagship of its submarine division, capable of carrying 24 seven-tonne cruise missiles with either nuclear or conventional warheads. The missiles have a range of up to 550 km. Capt Lyachin commanded a crew of 106 men, most of them navy professionals.</p> <p>On Friday and Saturday the three-day northern exercises were believed to be going well, with 33 surface vessels and submarines as well as 40 aeroplanes and helicopters taking part. Sunday was August 13th. \"The 13th is always a bad day for sailors,\" said another navy captain who asked not to be named. \"We don't have any cabins numbered 13.\"</p> <p>Some time on Sunday morning, disaster struck Capt Lyachin and his crew. Around 100 miles north-east of Murmansk and west of the Russian nuclear proving ground of Novaya Zemlya, the Kursk went down with all hands on board, according to the Norwegian defence ministry.</p> <p>\"It's not clear what happened,\" said an unnamed navy officer. \"But whatever it was, it must have been very sudden. The first thing a commander does in an emergency like that is get the sub up to the surface and then switch off the nuclear reactors. In a situation like that the reactor is your salvation. The crew must have been helpless. Now it's a very negative situation.\"</p> <p><b> Emergency</b><br></p> <p>Valeriy Danilyan, a naval safety expert who served nine years on submarines, said: \"No nuclear-powered vessel goes to the bottom except in an extreme emergency.\"</p> <p>Alexander Nikitin, the ex-navy whistle-blower whom Mr Putin has been trying to jail for his revelations about Russian radiation leaks into Arctic waters, said: \"The crew failed to cope with the situation.\"</p> <p>The unnamed captain said the Kursk suddenly lost radio contact with the command point for the exercises, though communications were said to have been re-established last night when the Kolokol rescue vessel submerged more than 300 feet to the Barents sea-bed to survey the condition of the stricken sub and attempt to bring in fuel and oxygen supplies for the trapped crew.</p> <p>In a pessimistic, if perhaps premature assessment of the tragedy, the navy chief, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, said there was little chance of salvaging the crippled submarine, raising the possibility that the two nuclear reactors which fuel the 500ft long vessel may be left to leak their lethal payload into the bed of the Arctic.</p> <p>The Kursk is the pride of the northern fleet, which has seven such submarines. It last underwent dry dock repairs and inspection in January 1998, said the well-informed captain.</p> <p>If the submarine has been flooded, potentially doubling its 14,000-tonne weight, said the experts, it will be virtually impossible to raise. NTV television news quoted Russian navy sources as saying that the prow was flooded when the torpedo hatches failed to close.</p> <p>But the flooding scenario was last night shifting to the more menacing variant of an underwater crash with another submarine. There was also the possibility that it had been hit by friendly fire.</p> <p>That the hull and bow were dented, according to first reports from the salvage crews on the scene, supported the crash theory. That the conning tower was also said to have been hit suggested that any collision occurred under water.</p> <p>The crash could have knocked out the ship's systems, triggered an emergency shutdown of the two reactors, and very quickly plunged the vessel to the sea bed, said the experts.</p> <p>According to the Russians, any crash with another vessel taking part in the manoeuvres would have been promptly verified by the military. There was speculation about a collision with a Nato craft in the area to monitor the manoeuvres. \"Can't be ruled out,\" northern fleet officers told the Interfax new agency.</p> <p>But British officials said there were no UK vessels in the area. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, said: \"We have no indication that a US vessel was involved in this accident.\"</p> <p>Officer Danilyan said the Kursk, which can descend to more than 1,500 feet and can operate autonomously for four months, has life support systems for two months. \"There is no chance of radioactive leaks unless the reactors are destroyed,\" he declared. \"If there is no fire and no smoke, the depth of 110 metres is nothing terrible.\"</p> <p>The big fear among northern fleet officers last night was that the crew of the Kursk would be unable to get out because the escape hatches had been jammed during the accident.</p> <p>It was unclear whether the submarine has escape capsules on board. \"The men train regularly for this eventuality,\" said the unnamed captain.</p> <p>Naval experts said that the greatest hope for the crew would have been to block off the front half of the submarine, which is dedicated to living quarters and weapons systems. If the living area could be sealed off in time, an operation regarded as very difficult to pull off, the crew could survive for several days.</p> <p>The more likely hope would be that some crew reached escape compartments. There they could survive for several days, depending on their oxygen supplies, pressure in the compartment and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air.</p> <p>\"It would be very, very dark and exceedingly frightening inside,\" said Commander David Perfect, a member of the UK Submarine Rescue Service. \"Potentially the crew could be quite panicky. Whether or not they survive may well depend on the strength of the man leading them.\"</p> <p>After several hours inside an escape compartment the crew would be faced with a terrible dilemma. Do they continue to wait in the chamber in the hope of rescue, in which case they may die from lack of oxygen. Or do they quit the submarine and attempt to reach the surface - in which case rapid ascent may cause the potentially fatal condition, the bends.</p> <p><b>Useful links: </b><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bellona.org/imaker?sub=1&amp;id=11091\" target=\"_NEW\"> http://www.bellona.org/imaker?sub=1&amp;id=11091</a> Bellona Foundation - information on Russian submarine risks</p>",

The 45-year-old career navy officer and submarine commander has dedicated his adult life, 22 years, to the northern fleet, advancing through the ranks, being decorated a couple of times, and taking charge of the Kursk, the five-year-old nuclear-powered Oscar-II class submarine based in Zapadnaya Litsa, close to Murmansk. The Kursk is the flagship of its submarine division, capable of carrying 24 seven-tonne cruise missiles with either nuclear or conventional warheads. The missiles have a range of up to 550 km. Capt Lyachin commanded a crew of 106 men, most of them navy professionals. On Friday and Saturday the three-day northern exercises were believed to be going well, with 33 surface vessels and submarines as well as 40 aeroplanes and helicopters taking part. Sunday was August 13th. \"The 13th is always a bad day for sailors,\" said another navy captain who asked not to be named. \"We don't have any cabins numbered 13.\" Some time on Sunday morning, disaster struck Capt Lyachin and his crew. Around 100 miles north-east of Murmansk and west of the Russian nuclear proving ground of Novaya Zemlya, the Kursk went down with all hands on board, according to the Norwegian defence ministry. \"It's not clear what happened,\" said an unnamed navy officer. \"But whatever it was, it must have been very sudden. The first thing a commander does in an emergency like that is get the sub up to the surface and then switch off the nuclear reactors. In a situation like that the reactor is your salvation. The crew must have been helpless. Now it's a very negative situation.\" Emergency Valeriy Danilyan, a naval safety expert who served nine years on submarines, said: \"No nuclear-powered vessel goes to the bottom except in an extreme emergency.\" Alexander Nikitin, the ex-navy whistle-blower whom Mr Putin has been trying to jail for his revelations about Russian radiation leaks into Arctic waters, said: \"The crew failed to cope with the situation.\" The unnamed captain said the Kursk suddenly lost radio contact with the command point for the exercises, though communications were said to have been re-established last night when the Kolokol rescue vessel submerged more than 300 feet to the Barents sea-bed to survey the condition of the stricken sub and attempt to bring in fuel and oxygen supplies for the trapped crew. In a pessimistic, if perhaps premature assessment of the tragedy, the navy chief, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, said there was little chance of salvaging the crippled submarine, raising the possibility that the two nuclear reactors which fuel the 500ft long vessel may be left to leak their lethal payload into the bed of the Arctic. The Kursk is the pride of the northern fleet, which has seven such submarines. It last underwent dry dock repairs and inspection in January 1998, said the well-informed captain. If the submarine has been flooded, potentially doubling its 14,000-tonne weight, said the experts, it will be virtually impossible to raise. NTV television news quoted Russian navy sources as saying that the prow was flooded when the torpedo hatches failed to close. But the flooding scenario was last night shifting to the more menacing variant of an underwater crash with another submarine. There was also the possibility that it had been hit by friendly fire. That the hull and bow were dented, according to first reports from the salvage crews on the scene, supported the crash theory. That the conning tower was also said to have been hit suggested that any collision occurred under water. The crash could have knocked out the ship's systems, triggered an emergency shutdown of the two reactors, and very quickly plunged the vessel to the sea bed, said the experts. According to the Russians, any crash with another vessel taking part in the manoeuvres would have been promptly verified by the military. There was speculation about a collision with a Nato craft in the area to monitor the manoeuvres. \"Can't be ruled out,\" northern fleet officers told the Interfax new agency. But British officials said there were no UK vessels in the area. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, said: \"We have no indication that a US vessel was involved in this accident.\" Officer Danilyan said the Kursk, which can descend to more than 1,500 feet and can operate autonomously for four months, has life support systems for two months. \"There is no chance of radioactive leaks unless the reactors are destroyed,\" he declared. \"If there is no fire and no smoke, the depth of 110 metres is nothing terrible.\" The big fear among northern fleet officers last night was that the crew of the Kursk would be unable to get out because the escape hatches had been jammed during the accident. It was unclear whether the submarine has escape capsules on board. \"The men train regularly for this eventuality,\" said the unnamed captain. Naval experts said that the greatest hope for the crew would have been to block off the front half of the submarine, which is dedicated to living quarters and weapons systems. If the living area could be sealed off in time, an operation regarded as very difficult to pull off, the crew could survive for several days. The more likely hope would be that some crew reached escape compartments. There they could survive for several days, depending on their oxygen supplies, pressure in the compartment and the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. \"It would be very, very dark and exceedingly frightening inside,\" said Commander David Perfect, a member of the UK Submarine Rescue Service. \"Potentially the crew could be quite panicky. Whether or not they survive may well depend on the strength of the man leading them.\" After several hours inside an escape compartment the crew would be faced with a terrible dilemma. Do they continue to wait in the chamber in the hope of rescue, in which case they may die from lack of oxygen. Or do they quit the submarine and attempt to reach the surface - in which case rapid ascent may cause the potentially fatal condition, the bends.

Your son is here,\" a 68-year-old man told his 95-year-old mother, who was so overcome with emotion that a nurse rushed to her side to take her blood pressure.

Men and women clutched each other, weeping and wailing. They consoled each other with pats on the back and offered handkerchiefs to wipe away tears.

The elderly North Koreans were ushered into a giant hall at a Seoul convention centre where relatives were waiting and the highly charged scenes were broadcast live on televison. \"Mother, be calm. Your son is here,\" a 68-year-old man told his 95-year-old mother, who was so overcome with emotion that a nurse rushed to her side to take her blood pressure. Another distraught man knelt on the floor and repeatedly bowed to his father, who sat in a wheelchair, too weak to respond. There were shouts of \"My sweetheart! \" and \"My brother!\". Men and women clutched each other, weeping and wailing. They consoled each other with pats on the back and offered handkerchiefs to wipe away tears. Some were quiet, sad and pensive. When emotions cooled, the relatives exchanged family stories and looked at old photo albums. Family reunions are among the most emotional issues on the peninsula, with many ageing family members having only a few years left to see relatives. Many people have died without making contact. There is no mail, telephone or other direct means of communication between private citizens in the two Koreas. Today's emotional family reunion marked the latest sign of reconciliation since the Korean War of 1954 - the two nations are still technically at war. A rapprochement between north and south accelerated after their leaders held a summit in June and pledged to work towards eventual reunification. While South Korea chose its 100 finalists for the reunions through a computer lottery, the North Korean list included a renowned poet, a painter, a film-maker, a scientist and other celebrated people. All the northern visitors are natives of South Korea who defected to the North. When the North Koreans arrived, their plane picked up 100 South Koreans for a similar exchange. On arriving in Pyongyang, the South Korean delegation chief, Chang Chung-shik, said: \"I hope these reunions will not stop as a one-time event and will continue so that the day will come when dispersed family members in the two sides can go and come freely.\" The head of the North Korean delegation, 78-year-old Yoo Mi Young, said, on arriving in Seoul, that more reunions would follow. \"I hope this development will help break down the wall of confrontation and division,\" said Mrs Yoo, who defected to North Korea from the south in 1986 along with her husband, former South Korean foreign minister Choi Duk Shin.

The film is full of wisdom about the folly of youth, about the sad inability of 40 to teach 20 anything.

While he was having a fine old time with the Rio carnival girls, RKO were panicking at test-screening reactions to The Magnificent Ambersons. \"People like to laff, not be bored to death\", read one comment.

There is no reason to think it won't be good. But sticking to Welles's script - if they really do - would be a mistake. </p> <p>What made Welles's film great - and even the hacked-up version is outstanding - was the cast, the cinematography, the direction. As Arau is unlikely to use vintage cameras, or have his actors act in the style of the original cast, or pace the series like a movie from the 1940s, the new Ambersons will tell us nothing about those reportedly peerless lost 44 minutes. All it proves is that Welles - who when he was alive was offered nothing but sherry ads and guest spots on bad TV shows - is hot in Hollywood in a way he hasn't been since he arrived with a fanfare in 1939. </p> <p>A final thought: just in case you thought the vandalism inflicted on The Magnificent Ambersons belonged in the past, it was just last year that the filmmaker-friendly FilmFour managed to destroy the outtakes from Peter Mullan's excellent Orphans.

      "body": "<p>In American Rhapsody, his excellent new book on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the writer Joe Eszterhas makes the case that Bill Clinton is not just the first rock 'n' roll US president, he is also the Mick Jagger of politics.</p> <p>So it was wholly appropriate that last night, in the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, Bill Clinton's managers lifted, without apology, a gimmick from the most recent Rolling Stones tour. As the stage darkened and the audience sensed that the star's entrance was near, a video clicked on, modelled precisely on the one the Stones used to orchestrate their own entrance a year or so ago.</p> <p>Down an extravagantly long hallway came the ageing legend, slowly walking nearer and nearer to the camera. Then, as the music grew louder and the cheering less restrained, the iconic figure almost seamlessly moved out of the video and on to the stage, a shamelessly theatrical entrance. The audience loved it. Jumping Bill Flash was back.</p> <p>But Clinton is not only a rock star. He is also the central character in a political soap opera that has held America spellbound for almost eight years. At the end of the last series, Bill and Hillary and daughter Chelsea almost split apart. The defining shot of the final episode was of the strained, stiff, don't-be-fooled image of the three central characters walking across the White House lawn hand in hand, jaws set. Would they survive? Most thought not, but only time would tell.</p> <p>Well, as in all durable soaps, the Clintons of course survived. And last night was the counterpoint to those grim endings in 1998, before Monica Lewinsky was written out of the script. As Clinton finished his speech, he was joined on stage by Hillary and Chelsea yet again. This time the strain was gone. It was all hugs and kisses and smiles. As another curtain falls, the Clintons will all live happily ever after - or maybe not.</p> <p>Last night was Clinton's bid to be taken seriously. His speech to the first night of the Democratic convention was a plea to his detractors that his presidency was not, like Seinfeld, a show about nothing. On the contrary.</p> <p>Clinton pitched his claims high. He was the figurehead of \"the New Democratic agenda that has taken our country to new heights of prosperity, progress and peace.\" He clearly felt he had nothing to apologise for, and this time he apologised for nothing. In the hall, hundreds of delegates deliriously waved placards bearing an unequivocal tribute to this most ambiguous of politicians: \"Thank you, President Clinton\".</p> <p>If you are one of those who simply cannot take Clinton seriously, this farewell speech was simply hot air on a torrid southern California evening. But if instead you are one of those who sees Clinton at least in part as he sees himself, as a politician who is engaged in a historic task of redefining and re-applying the progressive legacy of the twentieth century, then this valedictory speech was an irresistible mix of high seriousness and questionable aesthetics.</p> <p>Clinton's speech made huge claims. Some of them were laundry list claims - inflation down, jobs up, crime down, educational achievement up, and a lot more. Some list.</p> <p>Others were vintage rhetorical Clinton. \"The stars have never shone more brightly on any people at any time\". America was \"more hopeful, more secure, more free\" than at any time in its history. It was closer than ever to \"the America of our dreams.\" For a man who is bowing out, it was extraordinarily confident stuff.</p> <p>There were all the references to Al Gore than any Gore lieutenant could possibly have demanded, but you could not miss the fact that here was a master politician quitting at the top of his game. If he was allowed to stand for more than two terms, he would unquestionably be doing so, and all Al Gore's excellent qualities would be as nothing. And if he were standing, Clinton would, of course, be re-elected.</p> <p>He ended as he began eight years ago, quoting the Fleetwood Mac number that became his theme song in the 1992 election. \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.\" He is an impossibly tough act to follow, and Gore has an unenviable task on Thursday when arrives to claim the crown.</p> <p>By then, Clinton will be far away. As Los Angeles awakes this morning, Clinton is already far away en route to Michigan and the symbolic handover to Gore. The great speech was yesterday, and as the next line of the Fleetwood Mac song says, yesterday's gone.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.dems2000.com/PressRoom/00_speechtranscripts.html\">Democrat convention 2000 speech transcripts</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "In American Rhapsody, his excellent new book on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, the writer Joe Eszterhas makes the case that Bill Clinton is not just the first rock 'n' roll US president, he is also the Mick Jagger of politics. So it was wholly appropriate that last night, in the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, Bill Clinton's managers lifted, without apology, a gimmick from the most recent Rolling Stones tour. As the stage darkened and the audience sensed that the star's entrance was near, a video clicked on, modelled precisely on the one the Stones used to orchestrate their own entrance a year or so ago. Down an extravagantly long hallway came the ageing legend, slowly walking nearer and nearer to the camera. Then, as the music grew louder and the cheering less restrained, the iconic figure almost seamlessly moved out of the video and on to the stage, a shamelessly theatrical entrance. The audience loved it. Jumping Bill Flash was back. But Clinton is not only a rock star. He is also the central character in a political soap opera that has held America spellbound for almost eight years. At the end of the last series, Bill and Hillary and daughter Chelsea almost split apart. The defining shot of the final episode was of the strained, stiff, don't-be-fooled image of the three central characters walking across the White House lawn hand in hand, jaws set. Would they survive? Most thought not, but only time would tell. Well, as in all durable soaps, the Clintons of course survived. And last night was the counterpoint to those grim endings in 1998, before Monica Lewinsky was written out of the script. As Clinton finished his speech, he was joined on stage by Hillary and Chelsea yet again. This time the strain was gone. It was all hugs and kisses and smiles. As another curtain falls, the Clintons will all live happily ever after - or maybe not. Last night was Clinton's bid to be taken seriously. His speech to the first night of the Democratic convention was a plea to his detractors that his presidency was not, like Seinfeld, a show about nothing. On the contrary. Clinton pitched his claims high. He was the figurehead of \"the New Democratic agenda that has taken our country to new heights of prosperity, progress and peace.\" He clearly felt he had nothing to apologise for, and this time he apologised for nothing. In the hall, hundreds of delegates deliriously waved placards bearing an unequivocal tribute to this most ambiguous of politicians: \"Thank you, President Clinton\". If you are one of those who simply cannot take Clinton seriously, this farewell speech was simply hot air on a torrid southern California evening. But if instead you are one of those who sees Clinton at least in part as he sees himself, as a politician who is engaged in a historic task of redefining and re-applying the progressive legacy of the twentieth century, then this valedictory speech was an irresistible mix of high seriousness and questionable aesthetics. Clinton's speech made huge claims. Some of them were laundry list claims - inflation down, jobs up, crime down, educational achievement up, and a lot more. Some list. Others were vintage rhetorical Clinton. \"The stars have never shone more brightly on any people at any time\". America was \"more hopeful, more secure, more free\" than at any time in its history. It was closer than ever to \"the America of our dreams.\" For a man who is bowing out, it was extraordinarily confident stuff. There were all the references to Al Gore than any Gore lieutenant could possibly have demanded, but you could not miss the fact that here was a master politician quitting at the top of his game. If he was allowed to stand for more than two terms, he would unquestionably be doing so, and all Al Gore's excellent qualities would be as nothing. And if he were standing, Clinton would, of course, be re-elected. He ended as he began eight years ago, quoting the Fleetwood Mac number that became his theme song in the 1992 election. \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.\" He is an impossibly tough act to follow, and Gore has an unenviable task on Thursday when arrives to claim the crown. By then, Clinton will be far away. As Los Angeles awakes this morning, Clinton is already far away en route to Michigan and the symbolic handover to Gore. The great speech was yesterday, and as the next line of the Fleetwood Mac song says, yesterday's gone. Useful links Democrat convention 2000 speech transcripts",

Will to win Jan Southern, 36, took an access course at Northumbria University, 1995-96, then a BSc in occupational therapy, 1996-99. She got a first. I had identified a degree in occupational therapy that appealed to me, so I visited the university adult guidance centre for advice. They told me that the course had a lot of applicants and that to be admitted I would need to prove that I had the ability to study at that level. Because I had left school at 15 without A-levels, they suggested I took an access course studying sociology, biology and psychology. I felt the profession of occupational therapist was in line with my personal beliefs. I had been disabled myself after the birth of my second child, when I hadn't been able to walk for a year and afterwards had limited mobility. Sitting and listening for five days a week on the access programme was difficult, and so was writing essays, but I was driven by my desire to achieve. I always managed to keep my eyes on the end goal. Managing my time was very problematic, especially with two children. It was probably the most demanding thing I've ever done in my life. When I moved on to the degree, I expected it to be at least as academically demanding, but it wasn't. That was partly because it was a very work-based course with lots of clinical practice, which I particularly enjoyed. I was aware that I was performing well during the degree and had gained distinctions for everything I'd done on the access course. I think the degree enabled me to rediscover myself. After I graduated I was lucky to find a job through one of the part-time lecturers, who also practised as an occupational therapist. It was maternity cover for Newcastle City Health Trust in the field of child and adolescent mental health. After seven months, I moved to a senior post in a community scheme. The whole experience of returning to education has revolutionised my life.",

Officials in Brussels said that they had been forced to act after they had discovered that the number of farms affected by the highly contagious disease was much greater than first thought. \"There were more and more holdings being reported to have swine fever and being suspected of swine fever. We had to do it as a precautionary measure,\" the commission's spokeswoman, Andrea Dahmen, said. It is satisfied, however, that the outbreak is limited for the moment to East Anglia and stresses that swine fever does not pose any threat to human health. The Europe-wide ban was agreed in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and will initially last until the end of this month. It does not apply to exports of frozen pork destined for European supermarket shelves and will be reviewed by EU veterinary experts at a meeting on August 22. It is, however, another serious blow to UK livestock farmers who are still struggling to rebuild their shattered European export market for beef which was destroyed in the wake of the BSE crisis. British farmers will also be aware that an outbreak of swine fever in the Netherlands in 1997 led to the slaughter of up to 10m pigs and cost the Dutch government millions of pounds in compensation. The ban will not apply to pigs from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland which have so far been unaffected by the disease. The government was quick last night to say that it was doing everything in its power to stamp out the disease. It has introduced strict restrictions on the movements of animals and infected pigs are immediately being slaughtered. Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain had already said that they would no longer accept live pigs from Britain as a precautionary measure and the Belgian and Dutch authorities were the two countries pushing hardest for some kind of EU-wide action. This is the first time the disease has appeared in Britain for 14 years and it is capable of rapidly spreading through a region's pig population. Thousands of pigs have been slaughtered in an attempt to stop the disease from spreading and a six-mile surveillance zone has been established around the farms affected. Useful link Swine Fever",

There is no sign on the high metal gate. \"The brothel owners don't know we are here,\" explains a staff worker. \"It's not like at our office. They know where that is and sometimes they turn up with guns.\"</p> <p>The refuge had its full complement when I visited; 33 children and 37 mothers of whom 11 had been rescued from the brothels, eight from being raped, and the rest from domestic violence. Their stories were matter-of-fact tales of misery, only partly redeemed by their current safety.</p> <p>Prakso Pheara was 16, from near the Vietnamese border. \"My stepfather hit me and told my mother to sell me. They left me with a neighbour and a few days later the pimp came.\" She was fortunate in the first brothel. A Chinese client pitied her because she was beaten and paid enough money for her release. \"I went back to my mother but she sold me again.\" Pok Pou, also from near the border - one of the poorest parts of Cambodia - was only 12 when she was sold by her mother. \"My stepfather was sick and she needed the money.\"</p> <p>The two girls are part of a cheerful small community, learning how to operate sewing machines in an airy workshop. Pheara wore a UN sweatshirt; Pou had a shirt with the word \"Golfing\" on the back. \"They are just like normal teenagers,\" said Counsellor Bunna afterwards. \"But, you know, they are both already HIV positive.\"</p> <p>Sex exploitation of the young is a serious problem in many Asian countries with poor rural populations, but it is particularly bad in Cambodia with Vietnam now becoming a close second. Unicef in Phnom Penh has a project officer designated for \"children in need of special protection\".</p> <p>The big increase, explains Brigitte Sonnois, came in the mid-1990s. The economy was opening up, tourism was returning to Phnom Penh but the rich-poor gap was widening with population pressure on the land. \"Surveys in the open brothels show perhaps one-third below the age of 18, but we cannot survey the under-15s. There is an underground hidden trade for young virgins especially in demand by older Chinese men, both locally and from the region.\"</p> <p>It is hard to judge the proportion of those whose families connive in the traffic and those who are lured to the towns with promises of jobs. But the majority are sold through intermediaries already known to the family - a relative or a neighbour.</p> <p>\"The low status of women is definitely a factor,\" says Ms Sonnois. The only reason now why public attention is beginning to be focused on the problem is because of HIV-Aids. The rate of infection of married women, whose husbands have been to the brothels, is now very high.</p> <p>Chanthol Oung, executive director of the CWCC, believes that Cambodia has a particular problem because of the breakdown of social cohesion after the horrors of the Khmer Rouge perpetrated between 1975 and 79. \"Before the war,\" she says, \"prostitution existed but was not open. People who resorted to prostitutes were thought of as bad; now clients enter without the slightest shame even when our workers are visiting the brothels. The community as a whole thinks it is fine to have sex outside marriage.\"</p> <p>There has been some progress. The new Minister of Women's Affairs, Mua Sokha, is herself a woman. \"She's great,\" says Ms Oung. \"She helps us in dangerous cases like big night clubs with 20 to 40 girls.\"</p> <p>The police may intervene to rescue an individual girl - and the brothel owner may let her go to avoid any fuss. But she will be replaced just as quickly by another juvenile. \"These large brothels provide girls to rich and powerful people,\" says Ms Oung. \"When the night club is owned by an army general, the police don't dare make an arrest.\"</p> <p>Social tolerance for male oppression of women extends to wife beating - and even wife killing. There is a cultural inhibition about telling other people, and neighbours mind their own business, Ms Oung explains. Even when a husband kills his wife, he can usually avoid arrest by moving to another province.</p> <p>These are tales both of helplessness and of hope. Many efforts are being made by local NGOs such as CWCC and Likadho, and by Unicef and other international organisations. But no one in the field believes that they are winning the battle against one of the worst forms of human exploitation.</p>",

Pheara wore a UN sweatshirt; Pou had a shirt with the word \"Golfing\" on the back. \"They are just like normal teenagers,\" said Counsellor Bunna afterwards. \"But, you know, they are both already HIV positive.\" Sex exploitation of the young is a serious problem in many Asian countries with poor rural populations, but it is particularly bad in Cambodia with Vietnam now becoming a close second. Unicef in Phnom Penh has a project officer designated for \"children in need of special protection\". The big increase, explains Brigitte Sonnois, came in the mid-1990s. The economy was opening up, tourism was returning to Phnom Penh but the rich-poor gap was widening with population pressure on the land. \"Surveys in the open brothels show perhaps one-third below the age of 18, but we cannot survey the under-15s. There is an underground hidden trade for young virgins especially in demand by older Chinese men, both locally and from the region.\" It is hard to judge the proportion of those whose families connive in the traffic and those who are lured to the towns with promises of jobs. But the majority are sold through intermediaries already known to the family - a relative or a neighbour. \"The low status of women is definitely a factor,\" says Ms Sonnois. The only reason now why public attention is beginning to be focused on the problem is because of HIV-Aids. The rate of infection of married women, whose husbands have been to the brothels, is now very high. Chanthol Oung, executive director of the CWCC, believes that Cambodia has a particular problem because of the breakdown of social cohesion after the horrors of the Khmer Rouge perpetrated between 1975 and 79. \"Before the war,\" she says, \"prostitution existed but was not open. People who resorted to prostitutes were thought of as bad; now clients enter without the slightest shame even when our workers are visiting the brothels. The community as a whole thinks it is fine to have sex outside marriage.\" There has been some progress. The new Minister of Women's Affairs, Mua Sokha, is herself a woman. \"She's great,\" says Ms Oung. \"She helps us in dangerous cases like big night clubs with 20 to 40 girls.\" The police may intervene to rescue an individual girl - and the brothel owner may let her go to avoid any fuss. But she will be replaced just as quickly by another juvenile. \"These large brothels provide girls to rich and powerful people,\" says Ms Oung. \"When the night club is owned by an army general, the police don't dare make an arrest.\" Social tolerance for male oppression of women extends to wife beating - and even wife killing. There is a cultural inhibition about telling other people, and neighbours mind their own business, Ms Oung explains. Even when a husband kills his wife, he can usually avoid arrest by moving to another province. These are tales both of helplessness and of hope. Many efforts are being made by local NGOs such as CWCC and Likadho, and by Unicef and other international organisations. But no one in the field believes that they are winning the battle against one of the worst forms of human exploitation.",

      "body": "<p>Paul Klee was almost a symbolist, nearly an abstractionist, not quite an expressionist or a full-blown surrealist, and never wholly the Bauhaus technocrat. He made his own way around, through and between these epochal movements in modern art. </p> <p>As his most famous statement had it, Klee took a line for a walk. It snaked, looped, wandered off, and turned back on itself as it made its fitful journey through the worlds of his invention. On its way it found trees and plants, fish and camels, rooftops and roads, natural and human order, angels and woodlice. A donkey discovered in a wavering musical stave, a tightrope walker camouflaged amid a flickering field of dots, querulous beings and happy leviathans populate Klee's world. </p> <p>Some works are remarkably free and offhand; others have the intricacy of a Swiss watch. Klee could draw a whole city in a space smaller than the palm of your hand. </p> <p>The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art is now showing The Private Klee, more than 130 works from every stage of the artist's career, from a crayon sketch he made as a child to late, raw, pictographic drawings from 1940, the year of his death at the age of 60 from a debilitating skin disease. Almost every work, from the slightest, most rapidly executed drawing, to the most laborious, reconsidered, layered and agglutinated painting, has the capacity to command our attention for a long time. </p> <p>You don't so much look at a Klee as enter into it, inhabit it, daydream your way around it. Klee can eat up your time. It was an insult to the imagination when the Nazis included him in their exhibitions of \"degenerate\" art and sacked him from his professorship of Dusseldorf Academy when they came to power in 1933. Klee's work was so life-affirming, so joyful. True, he could invent lowering personages, and some of his earlier symbolist figures are morbid, wracked depictions, yet you never quite sense that they are in accord with his benign temperament. </p> <p>What may have looked difficult in the first half of the 20th century can fade by the beginning of the 21st. Somehow, even what passes for severity in his works wears a smile. Klee's art was made to give pleasure, to captivate, to delight in small things. It never grabs you by the throat, nor does it set out to shock. Klee's was an attitude that serious art seems almost to have lost, and it is a loss we should mourn. </p> <p>But following the winding path of Klee's work does not mean leaving reservations behind. Klee was never a robust, earthy artist like Joan Miro. Never - unlike his contemporary George Grosz - tortured, world-weary or sarcastic. Rarely angry, and never as crazy as Kandinsky, nor was he monstrous, avaricious, hungry or egotistical enough to be a Picasso. </p> <p>You can't be a Picasso, and those who try fail. But there are lots of passable amateur Klees around. Looking at Klee's work in Edinburgh, it is difficult not to think of the concurrent show of paintings, drawings and watercolours by Elizabeth Blackadder at the Talbot Rice Gallery. Where Klee is delicate, Blackadder is wan. Where Klee used collaged materials to great effect, Blackadder uses them to ingratiate. Of course, Klee kills Blackadder, but something of Klee, which persists in Blackadder's decorative, boring work, almost blinds us to Klee himself, or at least blunts our ability to look at him with fresh eyes. </p> <p>Part of the problem, I think, is Klee's popularity as a model for aspiring artists. Klee's example, promulgated in British art schools during the 1950s and 60s via Victor Passmore and Richard Hamilton, led to innumerable, fey little notebooks filled with abstractions from nature, decorative doodles, exercises in self-regarding style. None of this was Klee's fault. For all his didacticism and his teaching, Klee was a one-off. </p> <p>If he has had a continuing influence, it is to be found, writ large, in Sigmar Polke's work, and in Joseph Beuys's drawings. Even Klee's handwriting, which annotates so many of his drawings, is close to Beuys's (and both are close to Rudolph Steiner's).

Klee's studio was once described as an alchemist's lair, and the exhibition includes displays of the materials and instruments that he made and kept about him - home-made brushes, whittled reed pens, dental picks and razor blades fastened to improvised handles, gesso-caked cups and bent bits of wire, which he used to scrape, incise and abrade the compounded surfaces of his paintings. </p> <p>It is clear that Klee enjoyed the materiality of the creative process, creating peculiar, broken-textured surfaces on which to paint.

I think Klee needed the resistance of his materials to surprise himself, to waylay himself with the contrivance of accidents.

      "bodyText": "Paul Klee was almost a symbolist, nearly an abstractionist, not quite an expressionist or a full-blown surrealist, and never wholly the Bauhaus technocrat. He made his own way around, through and between these epochal movements in modern art. As his most famous statement had it, Klee took a line for a walk. It snaked, looped, wandered off, and turned back on itself as it made its fitful journey through the worlds of his invention. On its way it found trees and plants, fish and camels, rooftops and roads, natural and human order, angels and woodlice. A donkey discovered in a wavering musical stave, a tightrope walker camouflaged amid a flickering field of dots, querulous beings and happy leviathans populate Klee's world. Some works are remarkably free and offhand; others have the intricacy of a Swiss watch. Klee could draw a whole city in a space smaller than the palm of your hand. The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art is now showing The Private Klee, more than 130 works from every stage of the artist's career, from a crayon sketch he made as a child to late, raw, pictographic drawings from 1940, the year of his death at the age of 60 from a debilitating skin disease. Almost every work, from the slightest, most rapidly executed drawing, to the most laborious, reconsidered, layered and agglutinated painting, has the capacity to command our attention for a long time. You don't so much look at a Klee as enter into it, inhabit it, daydream your way around it. Klee can eat up your time. It was an insult to the imagination when the Nazis included him in their exhibitions of \"degenerate\" art and sacked him from his professorship of Dusseldorf Academy when they came to power in 1933. Klee's work was so life-affirming, so joyful. True, he could invent lowering personages, and some of his earlier symbolist figures are morbid, wracked depictions, yet you never quite sense that they are in accord with his benign temperament. What may have looked difficult in the first half of the 20th century can fade by the beginning of the 21st. Somehow, even what passes for severity in his works wears a smile. Klee's art was made to give pleasure, to captivate, to delight in small things. It never grabs you by the throat, nor does it set out to shock. Klee's was an attitude that serious art seems almost to have lost, and it is a loss we should mourn. But following the winding path of Klee's work does not mean leaving reservations behind. Klee was never a robust, earthy artist like Joan Miro. Never - unlike his contemporary George Grosz - tortured, world-weary or sarcastic. Rarely angry, and never as crazy as Kandinsky, nor was he monstrous, avaricious, hungry or egotistical enough to be a Picasso. You can't be a Picasso, and those who try fail. But there are lots of passable amateur Klees around. Looking at Klee's work in Edinburgh, it is difficult not to think of the concurrent show of paintings, drawings and watercolours by Elizabeth Blackadder at the Talbot Rice Gallery. Where Klee is delicate, Blackadder is wan. Where Klee used collaged materials to great effect, Blackadder uses them to ingratiate. Of course, Klee kills Blackadder, but something of Klee, which persists in Blackadder's decorative, boring work, almost blinds us to Klee himself, or at least blunts our ability to look at him with fresh eyes. Part of the problem, I think, is Klee's popularity as a model for aspiring artists.

Lining for mackerel underneath the cliff tops and in the coves and inlets along the coast near Land's End, he paid off the \u00a3500 he borrowed from the bank manager within the year. </p> <p>He had the grades to go to university but the lure and rewards of the sea kept him going back. </p> <p>The work has always been hard: weeks away from his family, living with five other men in cramped and grubby conditions; enduring the mountainous seas in the fabled ground of the Irish Box, or following the shoals north into the icy winds off the Shetland Islands. Days begin at first light and end when the sun finally sets over the endless horizon. </p> <p>But for most of Robert George's 35 years at sea the rewards have been worth the hardship. A hold full of cod or haddock could fetch its weight in silver in Newlyn harbour. Every voyage was a treasure hunt for the men on the Dew-Gen-Ny (God with us). Each member of the crew got a share, so even the lowliest deck hand could earn a small fortune after a successful week. Three trips in a row Mr George broke the port record for a catch into Newlyn. </p> <p>\"It is not a job, it is a way of life, 365 days a year,\" said Gordon, the engineering officer on the Dew-Gen-Ny. \"I'm a dying breed but I love fishing. Maybe it's the sunrises at sea, I don't really know; maybe its the fact that when you're out there that's all there is. You leave everything else behind and just concentrate on the fishing. I don't want to do anything else.\" </p> <p>But now the Dew-Gen-Ny is up for sale and Mr George wants out of the industry. Sitting in his local pub after 12 gruelling days at sea, he said the excitement has gone out of the business. What used to be a treasure hunt has had its heart ripped out by dreaded EU quotas and overfished waters. </p> <p>No longer can hard work and a good trip guarantee a healthy bank balance. More often than not half the catch has been thrown back because the fish are too small or because the boat has reached its quota. </p> <p>Not that the nets are full anymore. The seas around the UK have been trawled out, and while more and more boats work the grounds the pot of gold on the ocean floor is now little more than a thimble. </p> <p>\"There are too many boats trying to make a living out of not enough fish. The efficient will survive but the inefficient won't,\" he said. </p> <p>According to the other fishermen in Newlyn Mr George is one of the most efficient there is, and when he decides to get out it really is time to start worrying about their industry. </p> <p>He is not an isolated case. An atmosphere of doom and gloom pervades the quays and streets of Newlyn. Nearly every inhabitant is linked with the industry, from the men who make the nets to the landlord in the Dolphin pub. </p> <p>The fleet has been in steady decline for the past 10 years. The boats are ageing beyond repair and when the government offered generous terms for decommissioning in the early 1990s, more than 40 owners jumped at the chance. </p> <p>\"That is more than 120 jobs lost,\" said Nathan de Rozarieux, chief executive of the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation. \"If they offered the same terms again a lot more skippers would take them up on it.\" </p> <p>According to Mr de Rozarieux, the quotas, brought in to protect falling stocks, have been a disaster, as well as a source of antagonism against the Spanish and the French. The fishermen of Cornwall claim their waters have been plundered by the foreigners with their bigger, more efficient boats and bigger quotas. </p> <p>They want no-fishing zones, areas of the sea bed where the fish can replenish their dwindling numbers. But they have little faith in the government and even less in the EU to do what they see as the right thing. </p> <p>\"We are fast becoming just a cottage industry,\" said one of the local fish merchants. \"There will still be fishermen, but the industry won't support the jobs it does now. We have managed to keep things going so far, but if there is not a change soon we will have to start laying people off.\" </p> <p>But the Cornish fishing industry is not just suffering from an acute lack of fish, there is also an acute lack of men. A sign above one of the merchants reads \"Save our fish\". But perhaps it should also read \"save our fishermen\". The older fishermen and merchants remember when the quay would be full of boys helping to unload the fish, bunking off school to wash down the boxes. </p> <p>Justin, whose father and grandfather were fishermen, was one of those boys. From the age of 12 his teachers were lucky if they saw him more than one day a week when the trawlers were unloading. </p> <p>He began his first job as a deck hand on his 16th birthday and he has been at sea 250 days of every year ever since. He is now 25 and works on the Dew-Gen-Ny, but although he says he loves the life, he would not advise any teenager to go into the industry now. </p> <p>\"Where is the future in it? Its just not viable. It would be all right if we were whales or seals or something like that. The country would be up in arms to save us. We're an endangered species,\" he said. </p> <p>Even the experienced skippers and mates are leaving the industry in their droves. They are working the supply ships that feed the rigs in the North sea for a steady wage. </p> <p>W Stevenson and Sons is the biggest fishing company in Newlyn. It runs 36 boats, many of them named after long deceased family members who have built up the business over the past 150 years. The company employs a further 100 people on shore. </p> <p>But only 19 boats are working at the moment. Half a dozen are having re-fits, but they can't find crews for the rest. \"There is a real shortage of experienced skippers; they seem to have just disappeared into thin air,\" said Elizabeth Stevenson. </p> <p>\"Its partly all the forms and things they need to fill in, all the rules and regulations that have had imposed. Suddenly from just having a good knowledge of the sea and of fishing they need to be a bloody mathematician as well.

If things don't start changing soon I suppose redundancies are a possibility.\" </p> <p>Robin Turner, whose family have been fish merchants since 1760, said it was hardly surprising the young were turning away from fishing. </p> <p>\"They go down to the quay and they see these old rust bucket vessels and it must frighten them to death.

The cluster bombs were dropped from a high altitude despite evidence from the 1991 Gulf war that if this was done they were likely to miss their target.</p> <p>Senior RAF spokesmen yesterday were quick to claim that smart bombs performed better than during the Gulf war though they declined to give comparative figures for unguided bombs.</p> <p>But they conceded that only about 400 bombs were confirmed as hitting their intended target, 300 were \"confirmed misses\" and 300 were \"unaccounted for\".

The Shelton report estimate that 140 tanks, 220 armoured personnel carriers, and 450 Serb artillery pieces were destroyed in Kosovo. Meat's figures are, respectively, 14, 18, and 20.</p> <p>A senior British military source conceded last week that published Nato reports on the bombing were exaggerated.</p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory defence spokesman, said the report showed it was more crucial than ever to have an independent inquiry into the Kosovo campaign.</p> <p><b>Useful links: </b><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.raf.mod.uk/front_line/a_sshort.html\" target=\"_NEW\">www.raf.mod.uk/front_line/a_sshort.html</a> RAF - air to surface weapons</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.flightinternational.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.flightinternational.com</a> Flight International magazine</p>",

But Admiral Wilkinson, whose job is to advise on potential damage to national security, said yesterday: \"I did not ask for any single detail to be removed.\" British aircraft dropped a total of just over 1,000 bombs over Kosovo and Serbia, including more than 500 cluster bombs and 240 so-called \"smart\" bombs. The cluster bombs were dropped from a high altitude despite evidence from the 1991 Gulf war that if this was done they were likely to miss their target. Senior RAF spokesmen yesterday were quick to claim that smart bombs performed better than during the Gulf war though they declined to give comparative figures for unguided bombs. But they conceded that only about 400 bombs were confirmed as hitting their intended target, 300 were \"confirmed misses\" and 300 were \"unaccounted for\". The figures do not include bombing missions aborted by RAF pilots because they could not see their targets, because of technical problems, or because they wanted to avoid civilian casualties. Asked if the bombing strategy of flying at 30,000ft had been directed by a political unwillingness to risk the lives of RAF pilots, Mr Spellar said: \"I think it is a perfectly legitimate objective to try to avoid death and injury to your pilots.\" The MoD has persistently suppressed unfavourable figures relating to the Kosovo war. It is refusing a request made by the Guardian last April under the \"open government code\" to release figures given in a closed session to the Commons defence committee. It was revealed last week that a report by the US munitions effects assessment team (Meat) was suppressed by the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Henry Shelton. The Shelton report estimate that 140 tanks, 220 armoured personnel carriers, and 450 Serb artillery pieces were destroyed in Kosovo. Meat's figures are, respectively, 14, 18, and 20. A senior British military source conceded last week that published Nato reports on the bombing were exaggerated. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory defence spokesman, said the report showed it was more crucial than ever to have an independent inquiry into the Kosovo campaign.

The protesters' original list of 20 names included two people against whom no charges had been brought, three people placed purely out of vindictiveness, and a 17-year-old boy involved in a relationship with a 15-year-old girl. The 20 names were compiled in \"mental lists\" known to leaders of the marches on the Paulsgrove estate, and were the basis for the list phoned to police at the weekend as part of the demonstrators' truce with the authorities. In return, Portsmouth city council yesterday agreed to offer rehousing to those named, but stressed that it had no legal powers to move former offenders. The council's acting chief executive, Roger Ching, condemned the actions of a lawless minority but reflected public concern in a strongly worded statement. After a meeting with residents, he said: \"We will speak to the people on the list and if they feel under threat, we will move them to a place of safety.\" The council plans to set up a working group with residents, which will help them seek changes in the law concerning sex offenders \"especially on length of sentence and housing priority\". However, one of the residents' leaders admitted there was little or no foundation for naming over a quarter of those on the original list. Five innocent families have been forced off the estate by the marchers and 24 people have been arrested for their part in the disturbances since the News of the World started naming former sex offenders. Barry Pettinger, 51, a residents' spokesman, said some names had been removed from the list before it was phoned to police. He said: \"Of the 20 suggestions in the first instance there were two people who had not faced prosecution. \"Three of them, maybe somebody was stirring it up, but we just had to blank those out because there was no evidence against these people whatsoever. \"One person who was mentioned, we know for a fact that it is not what we would call sexual abuse against children.

Police officers testified that they \"noticed an unusual smell\" which \"was not burning wood\" and that they found Faithfull, who was referred to only as Miss X at the trial, in a \"merry mood'\" sitting \"on a settee wrapped in a fur rug with several male persons\" and that she \"let it fall from her shoulders from time to time\".

Paul Cavadino, Nacro's director of policy, said: \"This could potentially reduce a colossal amount of crime.\"</p> <p>The deputy UK anti-drugs co-ordinator, Mike Trace, said: \"We know from other research that getting such people into treatment can deliver substantial reductions in recorded crime and major improvements to communities as well as having health and social benefits to the individuals and their families.

The Home Office insisted the figures had to be treated with caution because the work, commissioned as part of an ongoing review of the government's anti-drugs strategy, was based on small samples and was already dated. However, Paul Wiles, director of research, development and statistics at the Home Office, said the evidence suggested the situation was deteriorating. Ministers hope the tide will be turned by two major initiatives. Within two years every police force in England and Wales will have the option of referring arrested offenders to drug treatment programmes. And from October 1, courts will be able to issue drug treatment and testing orders. Mr Wiles said there was already reason for optimism, pointing to the results of another Home Office funded study published yesterday. Research into the effectiveness of drug treatment clinics showed they have a huge impact on drug use and drug related crime. At one unit in Hackney, east London, heroin and cocaine use by addicts fell by 56% over six months. The treatment, which costs \u00a3960, also led to a drop in the illegal earnings of class A drug users - almost \u00a38,000 in some cases. Health minister Gisela Stuart said the findings supported the government's proactive approach to drug crime. She said: \"The results of this research are further resounding proof of the success of treatment in reducing the harm that drugs do to individuals and communities. \"We should be putting significant resources into treatment and prevention rather than responding only to the consequences of drug misuse.\" The government believes its anti-drugs strategy will have made an impact by 2003, and that its programme should not be judged while it is still in the implementation stage. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said the figures published yesterday strengthened the case for sentencing drug addicted offenders to treatment rather than imprisonment. Paul Cavadino, Nacro's director of policy, said: \"This could potentially reduce a colossal amount of crime.\" The deputy UK anti-drugs co-ordinator, Mike Trace, said: \"We know from other research that getting such people into treatment can deliver substantial reductions in recorded crime and major improvements to communities as well as having health and social benefits to the individuals and their families. This is why increasing the number of people in treatment is a key aim of the government's strategy.\" Useful links: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/hors205.pdf The report in full (pdf format)",

      "byline": "Gary Younge",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Hasnat Khan has never been one to follow his own advice. As a heart surgeon he tells his patients to stay away from greasy foods, do lots of exercise and keep healthy. As an individual he eats takeaways, smokes heavily and drinks a lot of coffee. Those who know him say he is a quiet, shy man who likes to keep himself to himself. In 1995 he started dating the most famous, least private individual in the world - the Princess of Wales. </p> <p>But while Diana's ill-fated escape from the long lens and tabloid obsession has at least saved her from the pain of further intrusion, Khan has lived on as one of the few remaining people in her life around whom some mystery remained. </p> <p>Until now, at least. For just when we thought there could not possibly be anything more to reveal, yet another branch of the Diana memorial industry has emerged with news that Hasnat was not just the man she loved, but the man she intended to marry. </p> <p>In a documentary tonight, Imran Khan (no relation) will confess that the princess asked him to act as a marriage broker between her and Hasnat. \"It was clear she was very deeply in love with him,\" says the cricketer-turned-politician. \"I don't think she could have got over it that quickly.\" His confession comes hot on the heels of another book, Diana: Her Last Love, by Kate Snell, which is dedicated solely to the affair. </p> <p>Khan is as unlikely a candidate for tabloid fodder as he was as a partner for Diana. He is neither indiscreet nor of aristocratic stock, like James Hewitt; nor is he a flashy playboy type like the late Dodi Fayed. He is a chubby-faced, unimposing, moustachioed doctor dedicated to his work. </p> <p>True, he has been compared to Omar Sharif and described as the \"dishy doctor\", and, after she broke up with Prince Charles, Diana vowed she would never again become involved with an Englishman. But place him in a lineup of probable mates for the late princess and it is doubtful that he would be picked out. </p> <p>Nor is there much in his background to suggest that he would find himself in such a situation. Contrary to reports about his humble beginnings, he was raised in a wealthy, middle-class family in Pakistan, near the city of Jhelum, about 120 miles north of Lahore. </p> <p>He was the eldest child in a family of four. His father, Rasheed, helped to found a successful business making glassware and bottles for the domestic market. But the real head of the household was his grandmother, Mrs Forkhunda Ayyub, known as Nanny Appa, a fact that would be of vital importance as his relationship with Diana developed. Hasnat attended and excelled at a Convent school in Jhelum, which he left to study medicine in Lahore after his A-levels. When his studies were over he went to Australia, where he started to specialise in heart surgery thanks to his uncle's contacts. He finally settled in England in the early 90s. </p> <p>By all accounts his first meeting with Diana did far more for her than it did for him. He was working in the Royal Brompton heart and lung hospital, assisting in a triple heart bypass operation that was being performed on Joseph Toffolo, the husband of Diana's acupuncturist, Oonagh. </p> <p>Diana had just arrived to see Joseph when Hasnat walked in. \"He merely acknowledged her with a formal nod then proceeded to focus on Joseph's condition,\" Oonagh told Snell. \"It is doubtful whether the Princess of Wales had ever made less of an impression on anyone in her entire life.\" Hasnat rather incredibly claims that at the time he had no idea who she was. \"I didn't even recognise her,\" he says. </p> <p>But as her visits to the hospital became far more frequent they got to know each other well. When she was spotted making a late night visit to the Brompton one winter's evening by a News of the World photographer, she called the paper's Royal editor on his mobile and told him she was simply there to comfort the sick and dying. </p> <p>The knowledge that the media were on to something did not temper her ardour. Indulging Hasnat's love of jazz, she bought him CDs of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Dave Brubeck, and accompanied him to Ronnie Scott's jazz club in Soho. </p> <p>But even though the affection was not exactly one way, Diana had invested far more in the relationship than Hasnat did. He had never been lucky in love. He was engaged to a Pakistani doctor, Nazra Nasim, for three years before she married somebody else. And his second fiancee, Furial Anwar, called off their relationship after a year. Diana wanted to run away with him to Australia or South Africa where she thought they could \"be alone\". </p> <p> During a visit to Pakistan in 1997 Diana slipped away from the media pack to visit his family in Jhelum. Whatever Hasnat's feelings, there could be no marriage without the consent of Nanny Appa, and while the subject was not broached directly Diana felt she should meet his family. </p> <p>A year earlier she had entertained Nanny Appa at Kensington Palace, where Diana presented her with a silver rose bowl. A video of the meeting shows Diana's relief as Hasnat's grandmother touched the princess's cheek in gratitude.

      "bodyText": "Hasnat Khan has never been one to follow his own advice. As a heart surgeon he tells his patients to stay away from greasy foods, do lots of exercise and keep healthy. As an individual he eats takeaways, smokes heavily and drinks a lot of coffee. Those who know him say he is a quiet, shy man who likes to keep himself to himself. In 1995 he started dating the most famous, least private individual in the world - the Princess of Wales. But while Diana's ill-fated escape from the long lens and tabloid obsession has at least saved her from the pain of further intrusion, Khan has lived on as one of the few remaining people in her life around whom some mystery remained. Until now, at least. For just when we thought there could not possibly be anything more to reveal, yet another branch of the Diana memorial industry has emerged with news that Hasnat was not just the man she loved, but the man she intended to marry. In a documentary tonight, Imran Khan (no relation) will confess that the princess asked him to act as a marriage broker between her and Hasnat. \"It was clear she was very deeply in love with him,\" says the cricketer-turned-politician. \"I don't think she could have got over it that quickly.\" His confession comes hot on the heels of another book, Diana: Her Last Love, by Kate Snell, which is dedicated solely to the affair. Khan is as unlikely a candidate for tabloid fodder as he was as a partner for Diana. He is neither indiscreet nor of aristocratic stock, like James Hewitt; nor is he a flashy playboy type like the late Dodi Fayed. He is a chubby-faced, unimposing, moustachioed doctor dedicated to his work. True, he has been compared to Omar Sharif and described as the \"dishy doctor\", and, after she broke up with Prince Charles, Diana vowed she would never again become involved with an Englishman. But place him in a lineup of probable mates for the late princess and it is doubtful that he would be picked out. Nor is there much in his background to suggest that he would find himself in such a situation. Contrary to reports about his humble beginnings, he was raised in a wealthy, middle-class family in Pakistan, near the city of Jhelum, about 120 miles north of Lahore. He was the eldest child in a family of four. His father, Rasheed, helped to found a successful business making glassware and bottles for the domestic market. But the real head of the household was his grandmother, Mrs Forkhunda Ayyub, known as Nanny Appa, a fact that would be of vital importance as his relationship with Diana developed. Hasnat attended and excelled at a Convent school in Jhelum, which he left to study medicine in Lahore after his A-levels. When his studies were over he went to Australia, where he started to specialise in heart surgery thanks to his uncle's contacts. He finally settled in England in the early 90s. By all accounts his first meeting with Diana did far more for her than it did for him. He was working in the Royal Brompton heart and lung hospital, assisting in a triple heart bypass operation that was being performed on Joseph Toffolo, the husband of Diana's acupuncturist, Oonagh. Diana had just arrived to see Joseph when Hasnat walked in. \"He merely acknowledged her with a formal nod then proceeded to focus on Joseph's condition,\" Oonagh told Snell. \"It is doubtful whether the Princess of Wales had ever made less of an impression on anyone in her entire life.\" Hasnat rather incredibly claims that at the time he had no idea who she was. \"I didn't even recognise her,\" he says. But as her visits to the hospital became far more frequent they got to know each other well. When she was spotted making a late night visit to the Brompton one winter's evening by a News of the World photographer, she called the paper's Royal editor on his mobile and told him she was simply there to comfort the sick and dying. The knowledge that the media were on to something did not temper her ardour. Indulging Hasnat's love of jazz, she bought him CDs of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Dave Brubeck, and accompanied him to Ronnie Scott's jazz club in Soho. But even though the affection was not exactly one way, Diana had invested far more in the relationship than Hasnat did. He had never been lucky in love. He was engaged to a Pakistani doctor, Nazra Nasim, for three years before she married somebody else. And his second fiancee, Furial Anwar, called off their relationship after a year. Diana wanted to run away with him to Australia or South Africa where she thought they could \"be alone\". During a visit to Pakistan in 1997 Diana slipped away from the media pack to visit his family in Jhelum. Whatever Hasnat's feelings, there could be no marriage without the consent of Nanny Appa, and while the subject was not broached directly Diana felt she should meet his family. A year earlier she had entertained Nanny Appa at Kensington Palace, where Diana presented her with a silver rose bowl. A video of the meeting shows Diana's relief as Hasnat's grandmother touched the princess's cheek in gratitude. At one point, Mrs Ayyub, a Muslim, lifted up the corners of her sandwiches, apparently checking to see if they contain ham. Diana assured her the filling was salmon. But within a year Hasnat's affections had cooled. He was fond of the princess but could not handle the media scrums and intrusive reporting. It was around this time that she sought the help and counsel of Imran Khan. \"I was going to talk to him to find out the reason,\" he says. \"Having married someone from outside my culture, if there was something that could be cleared up, or some advice given, maybe I could help.\" This is why he believes that the pictures of the princess's final days with Dodi Fayed were deliberately calculated to make Hasnat jealous and win him back. \u0095 Diana: Her True Love, Channel 5, tonight 8pm",

His contract had been ended following what he described as a kangaroo court of subordinate vicars and parishioners. The Rev Ray Owen, team rector of Hanley, Stoke-on- Trent, who has been a vicar for 32 years, has not been paid for a year and now faces the loss of some pension rights and eviction from his rectory following the outcome of the two-day hearing in London. In a judgment, which drew references from the three lord justices hearing the case to whether God had given Adam a chance to explain himself before being thrown out of the Garden of Eden, the court ruled that the present day diocese of Lichfield had followed procedures correctly in deciding not to renew Mr Owen's contract. But the judges criticised the Church of England's employment guidelines for not allowing the vicar the chance to answer charges against his conduct during the course of a private hearing at a parochial meeting in January last year during which his style of ministry was criticised. Mr Owen had been allowed to attend the start of the meeting and put his case for the renewal of his contract but had withdrawn before one of his subordinates in the parish, the Rev Richard Thornburgh and others discussed their criticisms of the way he ran the team ministry in the centre of Stoke-on-Trent. In public the meeting stated that the parish would benefit from a change of leadership. In private members criticised Mr Owen's \"robust and authoritarian style\" and an occasion when he had harangued parishioners who disagreed with him from the pulpit. Quoting from a judgment of 1723, Lord Justice Schiemann said: \"The laws of God and man both give a party the opportunity to make his defence.

A participant in the meeting described Mr Kim as \"clear and realistic\". Yet the sharpness of his political judgement was offset by more quirky opinions. The picture which emerged was of a leader absolutely confident of his own opinions, and accustomed to delivering them on any subject. He showed an entirely pragmatic approach to Korean history with no visible trace of ideology. The most powerful sentiment, expressed several times, was one of proud nationalism. \"The smaller the nation,\" Mr Kim declared, \"the stronger it must be to keep its pride.\" Mr Kim acknowledged that \"both Koreas had problems in their attitudes\" in the past. Each had exploited the slogan of unification \"for the purpose of maintaining their ruling system\". He described the post-war division of Korea in terms that some cold war historians might recognise as \"a cut-throat competition [by the world powers] to take the lion's share of the Korean peninsula\". He proposed that the demilitarised village of Panmunjom should be preserved as a monument to the past. Mr Kim urged South Korea's minister of culture, Park Jie-won, to bring to Pyongyang two well known female singers, begging Mr Park to be their chaperone. \"What could I possibly say to these women out of shyness,\" he confessed, \"upon meeting them for the first time?\" Mr Kim denied that he had a drink problem and complained at the way South Korean television had shown him draining a glass of champagne at the June summit. He then boasted about his skill in judging the merits of various kinds of rice wine, before admitting that \"my doctor told me that I shouldn't drink too much alcohol\". \"The best wine,\" he declared, \"is no doubt French wine,\" and promptly went round the table to toast his guests. Mr Kim confirmed persistent stories that he was a film buff, saying that \"if I hadn't become a politician I would have become a movie fan or a critic or a producer\". He also promised to write a critique of a film brought by his guests for him to view, and to deliver it within a week. Mr Kim displayed the same confident leadership style he had shown during the summit, saying that he could easily overcome objections by his military to direct flights between Pyongyang and Seoul. \"Why should we beg and pay money to China [for flights routed via Beijing] while taking a long detour?\" he asked. On the subject of television, Mr Kim bemoaned the number of commercials on Chinese and Russian television but said that he \"respected the [Japanese] NHK and the BBC\".

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton was set to make one last bravura appearance in front of the adoring Democratic faithful last night, opening the party convention in Los Angeles, before slipping quietly out of town and leaving Al Gore to see what he can make out of his mixed legacy. It was the climax of a long weekend in Los Angeles during which Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary have rarely been out of the spotlight, before leaving Mr Gore to put his own stamp on the Democratic party when he arrives in Los Angeles tomorrow. Before then the president will symbolically pass the torch to his deputy at a campaign event in Michigan, after which, the Gore campaign desperately hopes, Mr Clinton will conquer his instincts and fade into the background. The president was expected to mount a trenchant defence of his eight-year administration last night, arguing that it was absurd for the Republican presidential candidate, George W Bush to say that he and Mr Gore deserved no credit for America's soaring economy and greater social peace. America's sustained growth, budgetary surpluses and record home ownership would be at risk under anyone other than Mr Gore, he was expected to say. The speech was not expected to mention the Monica Lewinsky affair or the impeachment crisis which followed it. Aides did not expect him to offer another apology for his behaviour, since any mention of the scandal would snatch the headlines away from a speech designed to set out what he hopes will be his more lasting political legacy. In preparation for the valedictory address, aides said, he had been studying the much-admired way in which Ronald Reagan choreographed the similar moment in his own career, when he passed the baton to George Bush at the Republican convention in New Orleans in 1988. While Mr Reagan was widely applauded for the way he quickly left the stage, many critics have asked this week whether Mr Clinton can bring himself ever to do so. Mrs Clinton was also due to address the convention last night, becoming the only presidential spouse since her idol Eleanor Roosevelt to speak at three successive Democratic conventions. Earlier yesterday Mr Clinton rounded off an intensive three days of fundraising with a series of meetings with some of the Democratic party's core supporters, including blacks, Latinos and trade unions. He told reporters that he was confident that Mr Gore could overtake Mr Bush's persistent poll lead, but said it would take hard work to energise the electorate in a prosperous era, without the major divisions or crises of the past. \"We can turn around these polls, but it's not the work of a day. It's going to take every day between now and November,\" he told a brunch in honour of his cabinet. \"You've got to go out of this convention committed to telling people this is a big election, there are big differences, in spite of all the good that's been done in the last eight years you haven't seen anything yet.\" Everything Mr Clinton said and did in Los Angeles reflected the bitter-sweet character of these final months of his presidency. On the one hand, he wants to draw attention to his achievements by any and every means possible. On the other, he is aware that the more he appears to hog the limelight, the more difficult he is making Mr Gore's task. As he toured a succession of star-studded fundraising functions at the weekend, he showed yet again how much he is being pulled in opposite directions. \"How quickly it all passed, and what an absolute joy it was,\" he told a gathering in his honour on Saturday night. \"For me this was not only the greatest honour of my life but every day, even the bad days, were good days.\" Interviewed by the Los Angeles Times yesterday, he once again stressed his desire to surrender the leading role to Mr Gore while simultaneously demonstrating a characteristically obsessive interest in all aspects of the campaign to succeed him. And he could not restrain himself from looking forward to playing a back-seat driver's role in a Gore administration. \"I told Al once that if he got elected president, my main goal would be to stay out of his way, because America can only afford one president at a time,\" he said. \"But if he wanted to talk to me, I'd be glad to talk to him.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government is expected to make it a criminal offence to publicise the names or addresses of scientists, bankers and shareholders involved in drug testing on animals as part of a wider crackdown on animal rights militants. After years of targeting individuals engaged in violent acts at the extremist end of the animal rights movement, ministers are now working with research groups and police to target the planning behind individual acts. The Home Office confirmed last night that the minister responsible, Mike O'Brien, is engaged in efforts to tighten a range of laws which fail to address such problems as criminal damage and harassment. Such tactics extend to intimidating telephone calls at midnight, and to floods of unwanted goods that arrive at targets' homes - goods which range from clothing to skips which arrive by lorry. \"I once had 40 calls as a result of a small ad to sell my cement mixer. That was clearly harassment. After the 39th call I changed my telephone number,\" Mark Matfield, spokesman for the Research Defence Society (RDS), said last night. After Mr O'Brien visited Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), Europe's biggest contract research company, he convened a meeting with police and scientific interests. The company's shares have slipped since fund manager Phillips &amp; Drew sold its 11% share cheaply after a bomb threat in February. Though tighter restrictions on the use of names and addresses is a frontrunner for change, the DTI is examining the implications for companies which must, by law, publish such details of shareholders. Home Office officials distinguish legitimate public protest from the increasingly sophisticated violence, often attributed to the loosely designated Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and associated bodies. The Prohibition of Harassment Act, 1997, which has been used successfully against people who target fur traders, is being looked at again in the light of the 1,200 reported incidents of animal rights protest in 1999. But the scientific community is convinced that those convicted of dangerous assaults do not get the sentences they might if their perceived \"ideals\" were not being taken into account. Dr Matfield said last night that the AFL had shifted its tactics in recent years away from car bomb spectaculars towards harassment campaigns against individuals associated with research, either as employees or investors.",

But lurking just beneath this happy veneer there is a strong body of opinion among adults who are prepared to describe children as attention seeking (57%), hyperactive (55%), spoilt (54%) and inconsiderate (49%). The findings are the result of asking adults to think about other people's children and consider which of a list of 13 descriptions, ranging from well-behaved to rude and surly, most accurately fitted them. They were told they could choose as many or as few as they liked. The surprise was that the popular image of other people's children - most parents of course think their own are wonderful - as being badly behaved, surly, greedy, lazy and rude, was not born out by the opinion poll. The contrast perhaps is best illustrated by the comparison between the 61% who thought of them as well-behaved compared with the 35% who thought that badly-behaved described the children they had in mind. In spite of the more competitive atmosphere of British schools with their continuous testing of pupils just under half of adults (48%) believe that today's children are \"pressured to succeed\". The public are firmly of the opinion that life for children in Britain is more dangerous now than it used to be (79%), while a smaller majority (57%) think children are more at risk from paedophiles than they used to be. But on the other hand, British adults are quite liberal in believing that employers should be more family friendly.

Pakistan's claim to the territory rests on its Muslim population and its border with Muslim Pakistan. India's claim rests on the decision of Hari Singh, the last maharajah of Kashmir, to join the Indian Union in 1947, and on the fact that his kingdom, which became the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, was home to many Hindus and some Buddhists, as well as Muslims.</p> <p>It was not until 1989 that guerrilla movements sprang up among the easygoing Kashmiris.

The west must invest in economic and political stability in Pakistan. Then all the peoples of Kashmir should be asked what future they want: status quo, union with Pakistan or independence. This question, however, cannot be posed until fair elections are possible. The fighting must stop and paramilitary weapons must be silenced.

Marie Docherty, 58, also known as Sister Alphonso, is accused of cruelly treating girls at Nazareth House children's homes in Scotland over a 15-year period. On the first day of her trial at Aberdeen sheriff court, Docherty was accused of forcing a girl who suffered from epilepsy into a freezing cold bath during a fit. It was alleged that she would beat girls with a stick and rosary beads, deprive them of sleep, pull them by the hair along corridors and force them to wear soiled bed linen on their heads. Helen Cruister, 43, told the court that when she, her two sisters and three brothers arrived at Nazareth House in Aberdeen in 1967, Sister Alphonso had given them a bath in water laced with disinfectant. Mrs Cruister, who lived at Nazareth House between the ages of 10 and 14, shared a room with her younger sisters who would wet the bed each night. She said Sister Alphonso would force her sisters to stand with urine soaked sheets on their heads. When she asked her to stop, the court heard, the nun would hit her on the head with her fists. Docherty denies charges of cruel and unnatural treatment towards the girls in her care at Nazareth House children's homes in Aberdeen and Midlothian between 1965 and 1980. The trial continues.",

Jack and Zena Briggs have been forced to move home 27 times since their secret wedding in 1994, because of fears that their false identity package is too thin to deceive Zena's family, who had previously planned her marriage to a cousin in Pakistan. The pair, who courted in Bradford after meeting in one of the city's parks, say that they are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and cannot get jobs, because the protection package includes no employment history or references and the Home Office has refused to issue birth and marriage certificates to go with their new names and passports. \"The police, local authorities and even senior government ministers have chosen to ignore our problems.

She said: \"All we did was get married and we have been punished for it, not only by my family, but by a system that has chosen to ignore us.\" The couple plan to bring a case when the Human Rights Act becomes law in October, suing for the complete new identities offered to police \"supergrasses\" and former terrorists. They say that the case has implications for other victims of attempts at forced marriages - an illegal perversion of the arranged marriage system used by some Asian-origin families with prospective partners' consent. The Briggses have highlighted the issue in a book published three years ago, and they lobbied the junior Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, last year, with Ann Cryer, the Labour MP for Keighley, who has been prominent in attacking forced marriages. But Mr Briggs said that they now felt they had been \"used\" in order to spotlight the issue, but had subsequently been left to founder. The Home Office said that the issue could be tested when the Human Rights Act became law, but denied that the couple had been short-changed on protection. A spokesman said: \"At Mr O'Brien's meeting with Jack and Zena Briggs, he made it clear that the handling of the case was an operational matter for police and that ministers had no authority to intervene. \"The police acted properly and the couple are now adjudged not to be at risk,\" the spokesman said. The Home Office added that police had offered the couple suitable safe accommodation at one stage, but this had been rejected. However, Mr Briggs said that the offer had been too risky, because it was in a town with a large number of asylum seekers and a recent history of racist attacks. The couple say that they do not feel out of danger, because one of Zena's relatives had told her that the family would bide its time. Mr Briggs added: \"If we had been given the full new identity package, we could have started a new life. We believe that our civil and human rights have been breached.\"",

The interest-free \"budgeting loans\" from the benefit agency's social fund are seen as a lifeline for many people living on the poverty line who use the cash to purchase necessities like shoes, clothing, cookers and beds. But a new computerised system for allocating the loans introduced in April 1999 has seen the number of applications refused on the grounds of inability to repay increase dramatically. According to the social security secretary Alistair Darling's annual report on the social fund, the number of applications for loans refused on that basis doubled from 4,856 in 1997-98 to 11,102 the following year but, after the new rules were brought in, refusals soared to 362,000 in 1999-2000. Opposition MPs blamed the rigid rules for awarding the loans, which has significantly reduced the personal discretion of social fund officers to hand out cash to the people most in need rather than those judged able to repay the debt. Under the new rules, families with outstanding budgeting loans are refused further help until they have paid off at least half their debt. Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat social security spokesman, described the figures as shocking and called on the government to reinstate grants based on need to help the poorest families purchase essential items. He said: \"The government is slamming the door in the face of some of Britain's neediest families. They are refusing loans to people who are already paying off debts from their weekly benefits.

Grahame created his enduringly popular characters Badger, Mole, Ratty and Toad while walking along the riverbank near Cookham, an area he described as \"heaven on the Thames\". David Ricardo, of the Marsh Meadow Protection Group, has collected the signatures of 1,170 people opposed to the car park. Mr Ricardo, whose relative, Colonel Francis Ricardo, inspired the character of Toad, said the meadow was a national attraction because of its artistic and literary connections. \"People say that it has the most unsurpassed view in the whole Thames valley,\" he said. \"This view will be destroyed if a car park is built on the Marsh Meadow. Even though Cookham is only 45 minutes from the centre of London what makes it attractive is how rural it is. We don't need a car park - there is adequate parking here already.\" Cookham attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year; last year 16,000 people visited the Stanley Spencer gallery in the village. The meadow, on green belt land, is virtually unchanged since Spencer painted it in 1934 in The Scarecrow. The National Trust, which has a small car park on Cookham Moor, has not yet decided whether it will support the scheme. If it were to go ahead, access would be required across the trust's land. Windsor and Maidenhead council, which is considering the plan, says the proposed car park would have a rural appearance with extensive planting and gravel surfaces. It would offer easy access to the village and river and would be landscaped to screen it from important views across the river and moor, said a spokeswoman.",

      "bodyText": "Japanese fears of a wave of \"Jekyll and Hyde\" juvenile violence intensified yesterday when a \"well-behaved and sensitive\" schoolboy fatally stabbed three neighbours because the family had accused him of being a peeping tom. The killing spree by the 15-year-old, who seriously injured three others, comes amid a sharp rise in murders by Japanese teenagers, many of whom appear to have snapped without warning. According to police, the suspect broke into the farmhouse of the Iwasaki family at around 3am yesterday in Otsu in south western Japan. He then went from room to room stabbing the six occupants as they slept with a 10-inch survival knife. Sumiko Iwasaki, 66, her daughter, Tomoko, 41, and her grandson, Junya, 13, died of their wounds. Kazumasa Iwasaki, Sumiko's 65-year-old husband, is in a critical condition, while two other children, Mai, 16, who attends the same school as the suspect, and 11-year-old Seiya, are in hospital with neck and back wounds. \"I did it out of anger because they wrongly accused me of peeping into their bathroom,\" the suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told police. \"I intended to kill the entire family and burn down their house because I felt I was being ignored by them all.\" The triple murder is the latest and most brutal in a series of teenage crimes that threatens Japan's reputation as one of the safest countries in the world. According to the national police agency, the number of murders by juveniles jumped from 27 to 53 in the first six months of this year. The killings are certain to prompt more agonised soul-searching among politicians and media commentators about the state of a society in which frustration builds up in young people to the point where they explode. Psychologists have blamed the phenomenon on exam stress, school bullying and the violence in video games, comics and television shows. The prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has called for a reform of the education system to promote more morality and respect for life. Hiroko Mizushima, an MP who is also a psychiatrist, says the main problem is that Japanese children are not taught how to express their feelings. Yesterday, the headmaster of the suspect's school described the teenager as \"a well behaved, sensitive boy, who had trouble making friends. He was not the sort to share his worries with others.\"",

      "body": "<p>If you were living in Oxford in 1981, chances were that sooner or later you'd open your front door to a floppy-haired undergraduate trying to sell silk-screen prints of furry animals. One of these door-to-door salesmen was none other than our own dear William Hague, trying to top up his student grant by selling the atrocious prints for his friend Guy Hands. Hague, who earned \u00a310 per picture sold, has gone on to win glittering prizes - as indeed has Hands, who made millions in the City and is now in charge of the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>This episode from the student days of the dynamic duo reveals young William's admirable spirit of enterprise and determination to improve his lot. Indeed, in wooing the electorate, Hague would have been better off revisiting his days as a student salesman than boasting about the 14 pints of beer he once downed. Hague the prints peddler would have inspired more confidence than Hague the beer-swilling lad.</p> <p>I blame Amanda Platell. Hague's Australian-born spin doctor obviously thought that her charge needed to beef up his image. She was wrong. He-men win votes in Australia - Paul Keating - and in the States - JFK, LBJ, Bill Clinton. But in Britain, voters see red-blooded masculinity as a handicap in politics.</p> <p>This is not based on a post-Monicagate suspicion that a Real Male politico is a skirt-chaser first, a policy-maker second. Even before la Lewinsky, the British could never elect an \u00dcbermensch to No 10: they are comfortable with wit, moral rectitude, and even the odd flash of cleverness, but maleness, like any element of foreignness, must be tempered. The Real Man candidate should learn from Disraeli, who hid his Jewishness behind a dandy's taste for flamboyance and a wit's talent for the bon mot; and Michael Portillo, who is trying to dilute his Spanish origins with confessions of having dabbled in le vice Anglais . In the same way, the all-male man should conceal his red-blooded instincts, swap the caveman bellowing for the softly-softly tones of wonk-speak, the manly strides for the cautious steps of the MP in fear for his marginal seat.</p> <p>A he-man's high-testosterone levels and killer instinct make for an exciting character and a dramatic career - but how can they accommodate the dreary business of governing?</p> <p>The androgynous Edward Heath would be quite happy to plod through the reports of his special advisers and discuss their merits with the minions. But specimens of unabashed malehood like Michael Heseltine or Paddy Ashdown would have shunned the wonks and stormed about No 10 listening only to No 1. Heseltine's nostril-flaring passion and Ashdown's action-man drive were great for rabble-raising, but you couldn't help thinking, as they pounded their chests and roared their mission statements, that in their eyes consultation, representation and collaboration were the stuff of ninnies. Real men heed gut feelings, not focus groups; they bark orders, and don't wait for consent.</p> <p>Paragons of raw masculinity stir our suspicion that they'd find life in No 10 confining and not a little boring. After three years at the post, Tony Blair - new man, not he-man - looks thoroughly exhausted and as if he has been sucked dry by the office. But he-men feed off High Noon dramas, and no sooner would Alastair Campbell be settled in at Downing Street, familiar with the dispatch box, at home with cabinet debriefings, than he'd spend every waking moment plotting to turn up the national temperature with a lovely little war, a small invasion - anything, really, to prove his mettle and get the juices going.</p> <p>In middle England, especially, raw masculinity in a politician stirs unease. This is not because the folk behind the chintz curtains and privet hedges fear a return to the primitive gender roles of caveman society. I'm sure there are a million bored housewives who nightly dream of playing Jane to some grunting Tarzan. But voters in the shires view virility as something alarmingly foreign that hints at the violence they associate with Latin, Caribbean and African males. In this light even the diminutive Robin Cook looks threatening - a man of lusty appetites who packs all kinds of unspeakable and unpredictable dangers in his gnomish figure. Foreign secretary is as far as this swordsman can go because the British prefer the cosy, thin-blooded niceties of the home-grown gentleman.</p> <p>They used to tell women who wanted to go into politics to rein in their femininity; it seems only fair then to warn men with political ambitions that they should rein in their masculinity. Amanda Platell needs to tell Will to give another interview in which he lays off the booze but waxes lyrical about those furry animal prints he used to sell. Outside the colonies, this is how to win votes.</p> <p><b>Women are flying solo</b></p> <p>The list of reasons to have a man in your life is shrinking daily. You still need them to avoid having to ask the taxi driver to help you pull up the zipper on your dress that's stuck halfway up your back. But apparently more and more women are dispensing with men in the only other role I see for them - as travel companions. According to the travel industry, British women are increasingly going on solo holidays - 67% of them said they took their last holiday to get away from their husbands.</p> <p>These are not Shirley Valentine wannabes looking for romance in the hairy arms of Pedro or Pierre. They're hedonists looking for luxury spas in Bali, Indian Ayurvedic massage and the ultimate shopping experience (Dubai, apparently). Men would just cramp their style. But who oh who do these women get to fan them as they recline in the tropical heat, who swishes the flies away in India and who keeps the sheikhs at bay in Dubai?</p> <p><b>Sex and Question Time</b></p> <p>The Fawcett society, which campaigns for equality between the sexes, is up in arms. Members watched one Question Time and found that three times as many men as women were asking questions of the panellists. Well, that's not great, but things have improved a lot since I was first asked to take part in the programme in the early 80s, when I was editor of the Catholic Herald.</p> <p>The then producer, Sue Ayling, came to the Herald offices to quiz me about my stand on the issues of the day - old chestnuts like the republic, abortion and numbers of students in a classroom. At the end of our one-hour session, she asked if I would appear on the show. Chuffed that I'd passed the test, I readily agreed. Sue punctured my little balloon of hubris almost immediately: she confided that she was having a terribly hard time finding women who were ready to come on as panellists. Out of 10 women she asked, only one would agree to appear, whereas among 10 men, she'd find nine takers.</p> <p>These days, instead, her successor in the job, Justina Plank, is being deluged by phone calls and faxes from women MPs desperately seeking their 15 minutes of fame. And having been on panels with Harriet Harman, Clare Short and Ann Widdecombe, I can tell you that even David Dimbleby had to fight to get a word in when these women were on a roll.</p> <p>\u0095 Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman.</p> <p>\u0095 Charlotte Raven is away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you were living in Oxford in 1981, chances were that sooner or later you'd open your front door to a floppy-haired undergraduate trying to sell silk-screen prints of furry animals. One of these door-to-door salesmen was none other than our own dear William Hague, trying to top up his student grant by selling the atrocious prints for his friend Guy Hands. Hague, who earned \u00a310 per picture sold, has gone on to win glittering prizes - as indeed has Hands, who made millions in the City and is now in charge of the Millennium Dome. This episode from the student days of the dynamic duo reveals young William's admirable spirit of enterprise and determination to improve his lot. Indeed, in wooing the electorate, Hague would have been better off revisiting his days as a student salesman than boasting about the 14 pints of beer he once downed. Hague the prints peddler would have inspired more confidence than Hague the beer-swilling lad. I blame Amanda Platell. Hague's Australian-born spin doctor obviously thought that her charge needed to beef up his image. She was wrong. He-men win votes in Australia - Paul Keating - and in the States - JFK, LBJ, Bill Clinton. But in Britain, voters see red-blooded masculinity as a handicap in politics. This is not based on a post-Monicagate suspicion that a Real Male politico is a skirt-chaser first, a policy-maker second. Even before la Lewinsky, the British could never elect an \u00dcbermensch to No 10: they are comfortable with wit, moral rectitude, and even the odd flash of cleverness, but maleness, like any element of foreignness, must be tempered. The Real Man candidate should learn from Disraeli, who hid his Jewishness behind a dandy's taste for flamboyance and a wit's talent for the bon mot; and Michael Portillo, who is trying to dilute his Spanish origins with confessions of having dabbled in le vice Anglais . In the same way, the all-male man should conceal his red-blooded instincts, swap the caveman bellowing for the softly-softly tones of wonk-speak, the manly strides for the cautious steps of the MP in fear for his marginal seat. A he-man's high-testosterone levels and killer instinct make for an exciting character and a dramatic career - but how can they accommodate the dreary business of governing? The androgynous Edward Heath would be quite happy to plod through the reports of his special advisers and discuss their merits with the minions. But specimens of unabashed malehood like Michael Heseltine or Paddy Ashdown would have shunned the wonks and stormed about No 10 listening only to No 1. Heseltine's nostril-flaring passion and Ashdown's action-man drive were great for rabble-raising, but you couldn't help thinking, as they pounded their chests and roared their mission statements, that in their eyes consultation, representation and collaboration were the stuff of ninnies. Real men heed gut feelings, not focus groups; they bark orders, and don't wait for consent. Paragons of raw masculinity stir our suspicion that they'd find life in No 10 confining and not a little boring. After three years at the post, Tony Blair - new man, not he-man - looks thoroughly exhausted and as if he has been sucked dry by the office. But he-men feed off High Noon dramas, and no sooner would Alastair Campbell be settled in at Downing Street, familiar with the dispatch box, at home with cabinet debriefings, than he'd spend every waking moment plotting to turn up the national temperature with a lovely little war, a small invasion - anything, really, to prove his mettle and get the juices going. In middle England, especially, raw masculinity in a politician stirs unease. This is not because the folk behind the chintz curtains and privet hedges fear a return to the primitive gender roles of caveman society. I'm sure there are a million bored housewives who nightly dream of playing Jane to some grunting Tarzan. But voters in the shires view virility as something alarmingly foreign that hints at the violence they associate with Latin, Caribbean and African males. In this light even the diminutive Robin Cook looks threatening - a man of lusty appetites who packs all kinds of unspeakable and unpredictable dangers in his gnomish figure. Foreign secretary is as far as this swordsman can go because the British prefer the cosy, thin-blooded niceties of the home-grown gentleman. They used to tell women who wanted to go into politics to rein in their femininity; it seems only fair then to warn men with political ambitions that they should rein in their masculinity. Amanda Platell needs to tell Will to give another interview in which he lays off the booze but waxes lyrical about those furry animal prints he used to sell. Outside the colonies, this is how to win votes. Women are flying solo The list of reasons to have a man in your life is shrinking daily. You still need them to avoid having to ask the taxi driver to help you pull up the zipper on your dress that's stuck halfway up your back. But apparently more and more women are dispensing with men in the only other role I see for them - as travel companions. According to the travel industry, British women are increasingly going on solo holidays - 67% of them said they took their last holiday to get away from their husbands. These are not Shirley Valentine wannabes looking for romance in the hairy arms of Pedro or Pierre. They're hedonists looking for luxury spas in Bali, Indian Ayurvedic massage and the ultimate shopping experience (Dubai, apparently). Men would just cramp their style. But who oh who do these women get to fan them as they recline in the tropical heat, who swishes the flies away in India and who keeps the sheikhs at bay in Dubai? Sex and Question Time The Fawcett society, which campaigns for equality between the sexes, is up in arms. Members watched one Question Time and found that three times as many men as women were asking questions of the panellists. Well, that's not great, but things have improved a lot since I was first asked to take part in the programme in the early 80s, when I was editor of the Catholic Herald. The then producer, Sue Ayling, came to the Herald offices to quiz me about my stand on the issues of the day - old chestnuts like the republic, abortion and numbers of students in a classroom. At the end of our one-hour session, she asked if I would appear on the show. Chuffed that I'd passed the test, I readily agreed. Sue punctured my little balloon of hubris almost immediately: she confided that she was having a terribly hard time finding women who were ready to come on as panellists. Out of 10 women she asked, only one would agree to appear, whereas among 10 men, she'd find nine takers. These days, instead, her successor in the job, Justina Plank, is being deluged by phone calls and faxes from women MPs desperately seeking their 15 minutes of fame. And having been on panels with Harriet Harman, Clare Short and Ann Widdecombe, I can tell you that even David Dimbleby had to fight to get a word in when these women were on a roll. \u0095 Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman. \u0095 Charlotte Raven is away.",

Degenerative diseases like Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, hepatitis, diabetes, leukaemia and other blood disorders have great potential for stem cell therapy.

Suppose, however, that as in Nigel Farndale's compelling new novel A Suitable Hanging, an assassin took Mr T out. Who would take over?</p> <p>This is what West Highland terrier Steptoe, conqueror of TV's Thommo (45) in the 1995 Great Tipster Stakes, has been considering. After Gordon Brown's wedding the dog has revised his market as follows. Gordon Brown is now the 4-6 odds-on favourite, with current Blairite preference David Blunkett second best at 13-2. Jack Straw, John Prescott and Mo Mowlam are all 12-1, while O'Mandy Mandelson is 14-1. At 18-1, with Ken Livingstone and Sir Alex Ferguson, is public health minister Yvette Cooper. That's with a proper haircut. While she still looks like a swotty 14-year-old boy, Steptoe quotes her at 50-1. Bunched at 100-1, meanwhile, are Alan Milburn, Stephen Byers, Keith Harris, Orville, Margaret Beckett, Caroline from Big Brother, Robin Cook, Bruno Brookes and Geoff Hoon. Clare \"Bomber\" Short is 250-1. \u0095And so to our favourite UK tourist attraction: the Yelverton Paperweight Centre in Dartmouth. \"Both the casual visitor and the serious collector,\" says the leaflet, \"are fascinated by the range of beautifully handcrafted millefiori and abstract designs.\" I certainly was on Friday when I nipped in to what is \"reputed to be the largest private collection open to the public in Europe.\" Indeed. The centre is only three miles from Drake's home, and some scholars may wish, in the light of this, to reassess what he originally had in mind for the potato. Admission is free, but parties of 25 or more should ring before a visit on 01822 854250.</p> <p>\u0095Brace yourselves for some truly shocking news. Gerald Kaufman, who arrived last week on loan from Spitting Image producer Roger Law to prepare for his tour to Leeds in the Rolls-Royce Corniche RR1, has vanished.

      "bodyText": "\u0095While Mr Tony Blair enjoys his Italian holiday, his enormous, rock-solid lead in the polls suggests a long and secure political future. Suppose, however, that as in Nigel Farndale's compelling new novel A Suitable Hanging, an assassin took Mr T out. Who would take over? This is what West Highland terrier Steptoe, conqueror of TV's Thommo (45) in the 1995 Great Tipster Stakes, has been considering. After Gordon Brown's wedding the dog has revised his market as follows. Gordon Brown is now the 4-6 odds-on favourite, with current Blairite preference David Blunkett second best at 13-2. Jack Straw, John Prescott and Mo Mowlam are all 12-1, while O'Mandy Mandelson is 14-1. At 18-1, with Ken Livingstone and Sir Alex Ferguson, is public health minister Yvette Cooper. That's with a proper haircut. While she still looks like a swotty 14-year-old boy, Steptoe quotes her at 50-1. Bunched at 100-1, meanwhile, are Alan Milburn, Stephen Byers, Keith Harris, Orville, Margaret Beckett, Caroline from Big Brother, Robin Cook, Bruno Brookes and Geoff Hoon. Clare \"Bomber\" Short is 250-1. \u0095And so to our favourite UK tourist attraction: the Yelverton Paperweight Centre in Dartmouth. \"Both the casual visitor and the serious collector,\" says the leaflet, \"are fascinated by the range of beautifully handcrafted millefiori and abstract designs.\" I certainly was on Friday when I nipped in to what is \"reputed to be the largest private collection open to the public in Europe.\" Indeed. The centre is only three miles from Drake's home, and some scholars may wish, in the light of this, to reassess what he originally had in mind for the potato. Admission is free, but parties of 25 or more should ring before a visit on 01822 854250. \u0095Brace yourselves for some truly shocking news. Gerald Kaufman, who arrived last week on loan from Spitting Image producer Roger Law to prepare for his tour to Leeds in the Rolls-Royce Corniche RR1, has vanished. He was last seen in the office on Friday reading his Guardian and playing solitaire, but yesterday morning he was gone. Rumours that a party of Finnish tourists saw him in the West End negotiating with a tout outside Abba musical Mamma Mia are being investigated, but the police are taking the matter extremely seriously. \u0095In the down-market Daily Telegraph, the Peterborough column impertinently tries to tease Steven Berkoff over an Observer article about the Edinburgh festival. \"Yes there is in this festival an element of the preacher, the divulger of valued thoughts; the dissenter; lamentations on the state of man; burning issues; contentious views, passionate beliefs.

PPM is understood to have approached the advisers to HMV Media Group, the music retailer which at present owns Waterstone's, in the hope of opening negotiations. The chain has been valued at between \u00a3250m and \u00a3300m. HMV Media is saddled with debt and under pressure to rid itself of Waterstone's before it can proceed with its planned float. The book retailing business has been suffering from increased competition and saw a 34% drop in profits last year to \u00a337.2m at a time when book sales were booming. HMV Media employed two investment banks earlier this year to review its options for Waterstone's and held discussions with at least two prospective buyers during the early summer. Bertelsmann, the German media concern, and Borders, the US book store group which recently arrived on British shores, both made bids. Bertelsmann owns online book retailing business BOL, while Borders owns the Books, etc chain and own-branded outlets for books and music. Mr Waterstone had previously made an informal approach and had been temporarily suspended from the board of HMV Media - where he is chairman - in order to pursue a bid. If Mr Waterstone buys back the chain it will be an extraordinary twist in the history of the company. Since he founded the chain in 1982, the business has been sold to WH Smith and subsequently merged with Dillons and the HMV music chain. Mr Waterstone is known to be unhappy with the way in which HMV Media has managed the bookshop business, and has accused the executive of dumbing down the chain. He opened his first shop in the Old Brompton Road in west London and sold the then 20-strong chain of loss-making shops to WH Smith for \u00a342m, making himself \u00a310m in the process. Mr Waterstone also founded children's retailer Daisy &amp; Tom. Waterstone's, which includes the rebranded Dillons, has expanded to 300 outlets.

Ms Lefteroff said the record funding reflected the long-term nature of investments as well as the cash raised by venture firms themselves. Investments in the first half of this year, at $36.7bn, already top the $35.6bn invested in the whole of 1999. Both the number of companies invested in and the average amount invested had increased. Although enthusiasm for the internet seemed intact there was a shift of sentiment. Most of the money was directed at services or infrastructure companies rather than pure commerce sites, Ms Lefteroff said. \"Investments are concentrating on the business of the internet itself, not the latest hot sites.\" Silicon Valley still attracted more capital than any other region.",

      "body": "<p>Girl, 18, Faces Rape Charge.\" As headlines go, it is as chilling as it is unusual. On Friday, Claire Marsh, accused of cheering on an alleged sex assault on a canal towpath, was charged with rape. She was also charged with indecent assault and conspiracy to rob. Scotland Yard claimed the young woman had been charged because she allegedly acted as a \"principal\" with three boys suspected of carrying out the attack. Two other girls, aged 14 and 16, are among four teenagers who have been arrested and charged with intimidating a witness.</p> <p>Angela Carter wrote In the Company of Wolves: \"If there's a beast in man, it meets its match in woman.\" Her words appear prescient now. Whatever the outcome of this case, the very idea that a woman could be capable of involvement in another woman's rape is hard to stomach.</p> <p>Reported incidents of rape by women are extremely rare but not unheard of. In 1977, there was the infamous case of Joyce McKinney, an American drama student who followed ex-boyfriend Kirk Anderson to Esher, Surrey, where he was working as a Mormon missionary. With an accomplice, she kidnapped him at gunpoint and drove him to a cottage where she chained him to the bed and, he claimed, forced him to have sex. She was arrested and the case brought to court, but she escaped British justice by fleeing the country while on bail, using a false passport, and disappearing into the wilderness of America's Appalachian mountains. Tracked down last year, she told an interviewer: \"Everywhere I go, people always remember me as a woman who did the unthinkable - raped a man.\"</p> <p>Women becoming involved in sexual assaults is a phenomenon more prevalent in the US, where young women are deeply entrenched in the tribal initiation rituals of gang culture. Anne Campbell, a psychologist at the University of Durham, has studied the behaviour of girls in gangs, both in the UK and in New York. \"I first heard about women getting involved in rapes when I was working with gangs in America,\" she says. \"The girls would procure other girls for the guys - girls outside the gang - and would be involved in holding them down while the men raped them. Sometimes they'd go even further than that. But those would be extreme situations, perhaps where one woman had a grudge against another.\"</p> <p>In her book, The Girls in the Gang, Campbell asserts a Darwinian influence on the escalation of violent behaviour among women towards women. \"If you look at evolutionary theory, it tells us men use aggression to gain status and dominance, and thus preferential access to the most desirable women in their community. It used to be that all a woman had to do to get the most desirable man was to look good. That's changing now, so we're seeing more aggressive behaviour in women towards other women.\"</p> <p>There has been an increase in Britain in the number of violent crimes among girls under 18. In 1981, 65 girls were convicted of such crimes per 100,000 of the population; by 1997, that figure had reached 135. Last year, a survey by Loughborough University revealed that 80% of respondents, aged 14-18, had been involved in at least one physical fight; 15% of those claimed to have felt a high after the event. A larger study, by Demos, of 2,000 women aged 18-24, indicated that 13% thought it was acceptable to use physical violence to get what they wanted.</p> <p>In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases to reflect this upswing in female violence. Some of the stories were hyped to a frenzy, most notably Liz Hurley being held at knifepoint by a girl gang. These girls turned out not to be London's answer to Tank Girl or Lara Croft but three homeless teenagers looking for money to buy a burger - a fact that went largely unreported. More seriously, last November, a judge was prompted to \"name and shame\" a gang of 14-year-old girls who carried out knifepoint robberies on other girls.</p> <p>Another case, in south London, involved a 14-year-old being set upon by a gang of girls aged between 11 and 14. She was stripped, beaten, her skin drawn on, her hair pulled out and it was claimed she was offered to a gang of boys as a rape victim. Greenock teenager Barbara Gillen was tortured and abused for two days by a gang of five teenage girls, while Louise Allen, 13, was kicked to death by two female members of the Canada Square Gang in Northamptonshire back in 1996.</p> <p>Women may be seeking power by imitating male behaviour but there are other reasons for the rise in violent crime among young women. \"Girls used to be segregated off a lot more in terms of their activities and leisure time. Now they tend to join in with their male peers, so you get cases of them being involved in traditionally male crimes,\" says Rachel Lipscomb, deputy director of the Magistrates Association, who has worked with youth courts since 1985. \"In addition, girls are drinking far more than they used to. You can't overestimate the impact that that has on triggering aggressive behaviour. Latest figures suggest alcohol is a factor in between 78 and 87% of all violent crimes.\"</p> <p>Drugs are another factor. According to Maggie Hall, project director of Women In Prison, a large proportion of the young women they see are addicted to crack. \"You can come up with all the theories you like about why a girl would behave violently, but if she's puffing on a crack pipe and drinking a lot, logic doesn't prevail.\"</p> <p>Hall also advises that we look more closely at the statistics. \"OK, so you see there's a big increase in violent assaults. But then, when you ask a few questions, you build a different picture. Assault can mean pushing a store detective away or spitting at a policeman. I'm not saying those actions are right - they are not - but do they really constitute violent assault?\"</p> <p>There are others who say women's propensity towards violent behaviour is nothing new. \"Throughout history, there have been certain issues that have triggered violent behaviour in women. Look at how women behaved in the French Revolution and again during the suffragette movement,\" Lipscomb says. \"I'm not sure that what we're seeing is anything new.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is the issue that has been dominating the back pages of the tabloids all summer. David Beckham, Manchester United's star player, has reportedly fallen out with his boss Sir Alex Ferguson and could be moving overseas for a world record transfer fee. </p> <p>Offers of \u00a340m are said to have been tabled by foreign clubs. Mr Beckham is reputedly being offered a \u00a32m signing on fee and \u00a3120,000 per week to forsake Manchester for Milan. Mrs Beckham could even get her own TV show as part of the deal. </p> <p>While football transfer fees and players wages have seemingly spiralled out of control this summer, big City institutions have started to set up wealth management divisions aimed at sports' huge earners. If David and Spice Girl wife Victoria do decide to pack their bags for Italy it would be little surprise to see advisers from Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group and UBS Warburg jostling with the paparazzi on their villa doorstep. </p> <p>Merrills is the latest Wall Street group to start providing asset management services for athletes and \"celebrity net-worth individuals\". </p> <p><strong> Unrivalled roster</strong><br> </p> <p> Last month it announced a joint venture with sports agency IMG's Investment Advisers International to form McCormack Advisers International. IMG was founded in the 1960s by Mark McCormack, the grandfather of sports agents. Driven by the success of his first client, the golfer Arnold Palmer, he now boasts an unrivalled roster of clients, including the Williams sisters in tennis, US basketball player Vince Carter and golf's Tiger Woods. </p> <p>According to Merrill Lynch vice chairman John L. Steffens, the entity will offer wealth-management strategies and advisory services, including financial planning, tax preparation, cash and investment management and income collecting. They will be competing with Swiss banks UBS Warburg and CSFB which have both launched financial management services tailored to sports players. </p> <p>Previously private banking was the preserve of wealthy, long-established families but twenty-something athletes on Hollywood-style wages are now just as exciting a proposition. </p> <p>UBS's team is based in London and headed by Neil Grainger, who previously spent 20 years working at IMG, and Paul Miller, a Uefa cup winner with Tottenham Hotspur, who has been working in private banking for the past seven years. While the company says it has advised sports stars on their finances for several years, spiralling players wages have encouraged it to expand operations. </p> <p>\"We want to offer athletes cradle to grave financial advice,\" Mr Miller says. \"We're not just about asset management, we will help with ISAs, pensions, insurance against injury, property, estate management, the lot. </p> <p>He says footballers go through three five-year stages in their career. Between 16-21 they are at the apprentice stage and need to be helped with the basics of financial management. In their mid-to-late 20's they are at peak earnings stage and then they enter winding down time. Footballers need to take a different financial approach to each of those stages. </p> <p>Even today many footballers think that investing for the future means buying the local pub. Although sports stars have a potential for rapid escalation of earnings while they are playing sport, they rarely have a second chance to recreate any \"lost\" wealth, UBS says. </p> <p>\"When I was playing we got little advice on financial planning and much of it was not brilliant,\" adds Mr Miller. \"I've been down the same road as today's players, played in cup finals, moved club and had to renegotiate contracts, so they can relate to me.\" UBS is targeting the richest sports: football, tennis, golf and motor sport. On the purer entertainment side it is also building up a client list from the worlds of media, pop and classical music. </p> <p>The bank plans to extend its presence to Germany, Italy and the United States. \"If a young man is transferred from London to Barcelona, UBS in Barcelona can take charge of his affairs,\" says Mr Miller. Rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse offers a service in partnership with Interbroke, a British-based sports insurer, providing coverage for things like loss of sponsorship contracts, or injury and similar risks as well as financial advice. It has 100 clients, aims for 1,000 by 2003 and is run by Olivier Jaquet, who was a silver medallist at the 1994 World Fencing Championship. Both banks work closely with leading accountancy and legal firms because of the complex financial and tax issues that high-earning sports stars face. </p> <p><strong> Dodgy knees</strong><br> </p> <p> Extended family members often need to be provided for and pensions that kick in when the knees give up at 35 need to be arranged. Chicago Bulls basketball player Ron Artest reportedly employs a security consultant, a clothier and a barber, as well as supporting several family members. </p> <p>Many of the world's top tennis players and motor racing drivers have started to manage their tax liabilities by basing themselves in havens like Monaco (David Coulthard) and Bermuda (Pat Rafter) when they are not on tour. </p> <p>Yet not even some of the world's leading entrepreneurs and oldest dynasties can compete with the allure of British Open golf winner Tiger Woods. The 24-year-old's career earnings could reach $6bn, according to ESPN magazine. Suddenly the odds on Merrill Lynch or UBS opening a branch at St Andrews don't seem so fanciful. </p> <p><strong> Top earners per year</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Britain</strong> </p> <p>1.

      "bodyText": "It is the issue that has been dominating the back pages of the tabloids all summer. David Beckham, Manchester United's star player, has reportedly fallen out with his boss Sir Alex Ferguson and could be moving overseas for a world record transfer fee. Offers of \u00a340m are said to have been tabled by foreign clubs. Mr Beckham is reputedly being offered a \u00a32m signing on fee and \u00a3120,000 per week to forsake Manchester for Milan. Mrs Beckham could even get her own TV show as part of the deal. While football transfer fees and players wages have seemingly spiralled out of control this summer, big City institutions have started to set up wealth management divisions aimed at sports' huge earners. If David and Spice Girl wife Victoria do decide to pack their bags for Italy it would be little surprise to see advisers from Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group and UBS Warburg jostling with the paparazzi on their villa doorstep. Merrills is the latest Wall Street group to start providing asset management services for athletes and \"celebrity net-worth individuals\". Unrivalled roster Last month it announced a joint venture with sports agency IMG's Investment Advisers International to form McCormack Advisers International. IMG was founded in the 1960s by Mark McCormack, the grandfather of sports agents. Driven by the success of his first client, the golfer Arnold Palmer, he now boasts an unrivalled roster of clients, including the Williams sisters in tennis, US basketball player Vince Carter and golf's Tiger Woods. According to Merrill Lynch vice chairman John L. Steffens, the entity will offer wealth-management strategies and advisory services, including financial planning, tax preparation, cash and investment management and income collecting. They will be competing with Swiss banks UBS Warburg and CSFB which have both launched financial management services tailored to sports players. Previously private banking was the preserve of wealthy, long-established families but twenty-something athletes on Hollywood-style wages are now just as exciting a proposition. UBS's team is based in London and headed by Neil Grainger, who previously spent 20 years working at IMG, and Paul Miller, a Uefa cup winner with Tottenham Hotspur, who has been working in private banking for the past seven years. While the company says it has advised sports stars on their finances for several years, spiralling players wages have encouraged it to expand operations. \"We want to offer athletes cradle to grave financial advice,\" Mr Miller says. \"We're not just about asset management, we will help with ISAs, pensions, insurance against injury, property, estate management, the lot. He says footballers go through three five-year stages in their career. Between 16-21 they are at the apprentice stage and need to be helped with the basics of financial management. In their mid-to-late 20's they are at peak earnings stage and then they enter winding down time. Footballers need to take a different financial approach to each of those stages. Even today many footballers think that investing for the future means buying the local pub. Although sports stars have a potential for rapid escalation of earnings while they are playing sport, they rarely have a second chance to recreate any \"lost\" wealth, UBS says. \"When I was playing we got little advice on financial planning and much of it was not brilliant,\" adds Mr Miller. \"I've been down the same road as today's players, played in cup finals, moved club and had to renegotiate contracts, so they can relate to me.\" UBS is targeting the richest sports: football, tennis, golf and motor sport. On the purer entertainment side it is also building up a client list from the worlds of media, pop and classical music. The bank plans to extend its presence to Germany, Italy and the United States. \"If a young man is transferred from London to Barcelona, UBS in Barcelona can take charge of his affairs,\" says Mr Miller. Rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse offers a service in partnership with Interbroke, a British-based sports insurer, providing coverage for things like loss of sponsorship contracts, or injury and similar risks as well as financial advice. It has 100 clients, aims for 1,000 by 2003 and is run by Olivier Jaquet, who was a silver medallist at the 1994 World Fencing Championship. Both banks work closely with leading accountancy and legal firms because of the complex financial and tax issues that high-earning sports stars face. Dodgy knees Extended family members often need to be provided for and pensions that kick in when the knees give up at 35 need to be arranged. Chicago Bulls basketball player Ron Artest reportedly employs a security consultant, a clothier and a barber, as well as supporting several family members. Many of the world's top tennis players and motor racing drivers have started to manage their tax liabilities by basing themselves in havens like Monaco (David Coulthard) and Bermuda (Pat Rafter) when they are not on tour. Yet not even some of the world's leading entrepreneurs and oldest dynasties can compete with the allure of British Open golf winner Tiger Woods. The 24-year-old's career earnings could reach $6bn, according to ESPN magazine. Suddenly the odds on Merrill Lynch or UBS opening a branch at St Andrews don't seem so fanciful.

That eventually inspired him to lead an expedition on horseback to Xanadu but, as he confesses in Tales From The Back Of Beyond (11.0am, Radio 4), stately pleasure domes are now in short supply. Stark reality dawned with the team's first Mongolian feast - a bowl of livers, kidneys, hearts, stomachs and intestines enticingly steeped in blood and fat. The alarm about paedophilia in Britain is mild compared with the stunned shock of the Belgians five years ago. That was when the police discovered the bodies of four girls who had been caged, sexually abused, and starved to death by an out- of-work electrician, Marc Dutroux. Yet, to the bewilderment of the children's families, the case against him has still to be heard. In Belgium On Trial (8.0pm, Radio 4) John Egan investigates the allegations of a massive cover-up by senior politicians.",

Their main aim, in which Johnson was the intermediary, was to curb the left, particularly the supporters of Aneurin Bevan, such as Richard Crossman.</p> <p>Plump, with a bald head and fixed half-smile, Johnson resembled a china egg on which an upturned half-moon had been stencilled. His high-pitched, whining voice prevented his becoming an effective political speaker. He had earlier served as leader of Lambeth borough council and, during the early years of the war, as assistant town clerk of Southall.</p> <p>He was rewarded for his loyalty in 1959, when Morrison, having been worsted by Hugh Gaitskell for Labour's leadership, became a life peer, and managed to get his old constituency to pick Johnson as his successor. On being elected, Johnson contrasted \"pragmatists\" - such as himself - with leftwing \"fundamentalists\", who defied the electorate.</p> <p>Given his disciplinarian past, it was curious that, as an MP, he then became something of a rebel. In 1965, he wrote a report urging links between the six countries of the EEC and the Western European Union. He became secretary to the British Council of the European Movement and vice president of the Labour Committee for Europe. In 1974, he chastised the Economist for its \"partisan\" reporting of the Arab-Israeli war, and attacked Israeli intransigence in a letter to the Guardian.</p> <p>Such views, his age (then 70), plus his low profile in the Commons, where he preferred to serve as chairman of committees, did not make his survival likely when local constituency boundaries were redrawn before the February 1974 general election; nor did his running war with his neighbour, James Dickens, the leftwing MP for Lewisham West.

      "bodyText": "Carol Johnson, who has died aged 97, was a long-serving general secretary of the Parliamentary Labour party, from 1943-59, who then inherited the safe Lewisham South seat from his political master, Herbert Morrison, and was its MP from 1959 until 1974. During Labour's years in power - as part of the wartime coalition government, and after its 1945 election victory - he was the instrument of rightwing party disciplinarians like chief whip William Whitely and Morrison himself, then lord president of the council. Their main aim, in which Johnson was the intermediary, was to curb the left, particularly the supporters of Aneurin Bevan, such as Richard Crossman. Plump, with a bald head and fixed half-smile, Johnson resembled a china egg on which an upturned half-moon had been stencilled. His high-pitched, whining voice prevented his becoming an effective political speaker. He had earlier served as leader of Lambeth borough council and, during the early years of the war, as assistant town clerk of Southall. He was rewarded for his loyalty in 1959, when Morrison, having been worsted by Hugh Gaitskell for Labour's leadership, became a life peer, and managed to get his old constituency to pick Johnson as his successor. On being elected, Johnson contrasted \"pragmatists\" - such as himself - with leftwing \"fundamentalists\", who defied the electorate. Given his disciplinarian past, it was curious that, as an MP, he then became something of a rebel. In 1965, he wrote a report urging links between the six countries of the EEC and the Western European Union. He became secretary to the British Council of the European Movement and vice president of the Labour Committee for Europe. In 1974, he chastised the Economist for its \"partisan\" reporting of the Arab-Israeli war, and attacked Israeli intransigence in a letter to the Guardian. Such views, his age (then 70), plus his low profile in the Commons, where he preferred to serve as chairman of committees, did not make his survival likely when local constituency boundaries were redrawn before the February 1974 general election; nor did his running war with his neighbour, James Dickens, the leftwing MP for Lewisham West. So he withdrew from the contest and retired to East Sussex. Even so, Johnson's career had been a high climb for someone from a modest London family, who attended only local council schools. He became a solicitor in 1933, often serving as poor man's lawyer and adviser to housing associations. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Edna. \u0095 Carol Alfred Johnson, politician, born 1903; died July 30 2000",

Of course he could continue to rail at the townies occupying the empty housing vacated by workers who have moved in the hope of finding jobs in the towns. Steven Twigg Cholmondeston, Cheshire stevetwigg@netcentral.co.uk \u0095 Christopher Hart's pessimistic view of the future need not be realised. Two not very radical changes could make a huge difference. First, introduce high council tax rates on second homes. Not only would this free up more existing properties for local people and avoid the need for a massive house building programme, it would also generate additional revenue for rural areas and help redress the negative impact of second homes on rural economies. Second, give a greater proportion of subsidies to organic and small livestock producers. This would increase rural employment, reduce our heavy reliance on imported produce and maintain a diverse countryside. Robin Taylor Chagford, Devon \u0095 A decision has been made, apparently, that advertising hoardings should be allowed throughout the countryside, as a means of encouraging farmers to diversify - an amazing proposal to destroy, at a stroke, the aspect of the countryside, protected for more than 50 years. Increasing incomes for farmers with land alongside heavily used roads seems at best a lottery and, in any case, least likely to help hill and sheep farmers in remote areas. If there is a case for help for worst-hit farmers, let it be transparent and focused: a means which will enhance the countryside, such as the support for wildlife verges, hedges and woodlands, rather than one which would destroy all view of it.

On the eve of the annual examination results season, a major survey backed by two of the teaching unions warned that our youngsters are being \"tested to destruction\", typically facing more than 75 external tests and exams during their time at school. On cue, in the last few days the Samaritans have launched their first website awareness campaign for young people who don't know how to cope after receiving disappointing exam results. But undeterred, ministers will bid farewell this week to the existing system of post-16 education and hail the introduction of an arguably more complex raft of exams this autumn as key to its standards-raising agenda.

The scientific adviser has a particularly awkward position within government: acting as civil servant, with all the constraints that entails, on the one hand, but also needing to be, and to be seen as, an independent expert voice.</p> <p>The dual role is symbolised by the two offices May has come to use in the job - one in the Cabinet Office, representing his role as adviser to the prime minister, the other in the Office of Science and Technology, the department of which he is nominally in charge.</p> <p>From this small corner of Whitehall, and without any real financial clout, the adviser tries to influence spending on research and development in all government departments, from defence to the environment to fisheries and food. It is a tough challenge, and May has openly conceded that one of his failures has been to prevent research budget cuts at the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Among the three central accomplishments May cites during his time as adviser is his now-renowned statistical analyses of science publications and research spending. These transformed an arcane topic into a widely used source for comparing the research performance of the UK with that of other countries.</p> <p>When evidence-based policy was all the rage within Whitehall, May's conclusions kept re-emerging in ministerial speeches.

May has played his part in the renaissance of science within the heart of government, which has seen it emerge as a priority in the last two spending reviews.</p> <p>Another major success listed by May is the recent government white paper on science and innovation, the seeds of which were planted during May's brief but close relationship with Peter Mandelson, during his short spell as trade and industry secretary. Mandelson, like the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is convinced that the new high-tech businesses are the future powerhouses of the economy.</p> <p>May also mentions the guidelines for scientific advice now used throughout Whitehall, when departments are making important policy and regulatory decisions.

Yet trawling through press clips of May over the last five years, one gets a clear impression of the high regard in which he is held by journalists. \"Honourable\" and \"admirable\" are just two of the words used to describe him. He is a reporter's dream: plain-talking, accessible, with a great turn of phrase - the very antithesis of what most would envisage from a senior academic or scientist.</p> <p>But May's most lasting impression may well be his contribution to the first tentative steps towards the democratisation of science.</p> <p>Asked whether the government or scientific community could have done anything to prevent the BSE crisis, he has argued that it is difficult to identify any major mistakes: ministers and advisers simply acted on the best advice available to them at the time.
