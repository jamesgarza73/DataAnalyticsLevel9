      "body": "<p>Bolton Wanderers have been halted one step from Wembley already this season, by Tranmere in the Worthington Cup. This afternoon they hope to make amends when Charlton visit in the FA Cup quarter-final. </p> <p>\"It's not often you get the chance to go to Wembley but we've two opportunities,\" said their manager Sam Allardyce. \"We missed the first one and we want to make sure we don't miss the second one, so that's an added spur.\" </p> <p>The task is no easy one. Charlton came from two goals down to defeat Coventry in the previous round and took a club-record ninth straight league win in midweek. </p> <p>The only disappointment for Allardyce is that the tie is not considered glamorous enough to televise. \"A top-of-the-First-Division side who've won 11 games on the trot against a side which just missed out on a place at Wembley in the Worthington Cup final would have been an attraction,\" he said. </p> <p>Bolton's superstitious players believe luck is on their side after they refused to touch the FA Cup when the sponsor AXA brought the trophy to their training ground. Allardyce is not so sure: \"I chose not to touch the Worthington Cup and it didn't do me any good.\" </p> <p>The game guarantees the presence of at least one First Division side in the semi-finals. Tranmere hope to make it two by beating Newcastle at home tomorrow. </p> <p>They already have the Worthington Cup final against Leicester to look forward to next weekend and have so far seen off Coventry, West Ham, Sunderland and Middlesbrough in cup combat. But their manager John Aldridge recognises that containing Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson is the toughest task of the lot. </p> <p>\"They are on fire, there's no doubt about that,\" he said. \"Last week they were turning over Manchester United and now it's our turn to try to stop them. As a partnership they are red hot and seem to be getting better and better. We have stopped a few top strikers so far in this cup run but this is the sternest test for us.\" </p> <p>A stern test awaits Gillingham at Stamford Bridge tomorrow, while Everton take on Aston Villa at Goodison Park. David Unsworth, who won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995, said: \"Taking Everton to Wembley would be a big step in the right direction to making this club great again.\" </p> <p>Lou Macari has launched legal proceedings against Stoke nearly three years after resigning. He has made a claim for wrongful dismissal but Stoke said: \"The club is vigorously defending Mr Macari's claims and is bringing a counter-claim against him in respect of his failure to repay substantial loans made to him while at the club.\" </p> <p>Leeds's Harry Kewell is set to make his first appearance for Australia in nine months after being named in the squad to play a friendly in Hungary next week. But first he must recover from an ankle injury which makes him doubtful for tomorrow's game against Manchester United.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bolton Wanderers have been halted one step from Wembley already this season, by Tranmere in the Worthington Cup. This afternoon they hope to make amends when Charlton visit in the FA Cup quarter-final. \"It's not often you get the chance to go to Wembley but we've two opportunities,\" said their manager Sam Allardyce. \"We missed the first one and we want to make sure we don't miss the second one, so that's an added spur.\" The task is no easy one. Charlton came from two goals down to defeat Coventry in the previous round and took a club-record ninth straight league win in midweek. The only disappointment for Allardyce is that the tie is not considered glamorous enough to televise. \"A top-of-the-First-Division side who've won 11 games on the trot against a side which just missed out on a place at Wembley in the Worthington Cup final would have been an attraction,\" he said. Bolton's superstitious players believe luck is on their side after they refused to touch the FA Cup when the sponsor AXA brought the trophy to their training ground. Allardyce is not so sure: \"I chose not to touch the Worthington Cup and it didn't do me any good.\" The game guarantees the presence of at least one First Division side in the semi-finals. Tranmere hope to make it two by beating Newcastle at home tomorrow. They already have the Worthington Cup final against Leicester to look forward to next weekend and have so far seen off Coventry, West Ham, Sunderland and Middlesbrough in cup combat. But their manager John Aldridge recognises that containing Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson is the toughest task of the lot. \"They are on fire, there's no doubt about that,\" he said. \"Last week they were turning over Manchester United and now it's our turn to try to stop them. As a partnership they are red hot and seem to be getting better and better. We have stopped a few top strikers so far in this cup run but this is the sternest test for us.\" A stern test awaits Gillingham at Stamford Bridge tomorrow, while Everton take on Aston Villa at Goodison Park. David Unsworth, who won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995, said: \"Taking Everton to Wembley would be a big step in the right direction to making this club great again.\" Lou Macari has launched legal proceedings against Stoke nearly three years after resigning. He has made a claim for wrongful dismissal but Stoke said: \"The club is vigorously defending Mr Macari's claims and is bringing a counter-claim against him in respect of his failure to repay substantial loans made to him while at the club.\" Leeds's Harry Kewell is set to make his first appearance for Australia in nine months after being named in the squad to play a friendly in Hungary next week. But first he must recover from an ankle injury which makes him doubtful for tomorrow's game against Manchester United.",

      "body": "<p>I wonder if Bobby Robson remembered to ring room service and order himself a glass of champagne after settling his charges in bed at their Warrington hotel last night. The spry and engaging pensioner would have had plenty of reasons to toast himself - even if yesterday had not been his 67th birthday, and even if Newcastle had not marked the date by announcing a 12-month extension to his contract. </p> <p>Whatever happens in tomorrow's FA Cup quarter-final against Tranmere Rovers, the patriarch Robson's almost biblical resurrection of Newcastle United is one of the most touching stories of this Premiership season. Revival of a corpse is one thing but the colourful dash with which Robson's black-and-whites have been reinvigorated warms the cockles of English football's army of unbiased cognoscenti. Newcastle's ravishing 3-0 defeat of Manchester United alone released a flock of pigeons into the slumberous cattery and recharged the whole championship race. </p> <p>The added piquancy is that the white-haired prophet is a true north-easterner, a Tooner through and through. His miner father introduced the boy to Newcastle's legendary post-war teams: \"Invariably we'd be first in the queue at noon, and I worshipped Albert [Stubbins] and Joe [Harvey], Len [Shackleton] and, of course, Wor Jack [Milburn].\" </p> <p>A half-century ago, on his 17th birthday, young Robson left the Durham pit village of Langley Park to seek fame and fortune in London and beyond. He found both those things and more. He played for England, then managed the national side at two World Cups - when different rubs of the green might have seen England reach the final on both occasions. </p> <p>Though he was still admired as a masterclass coach in Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, there remained a classic and ancient football colony that held the fondest place in this wanderer's heart, an inborn allegiance that uplifted his soul for fully 50 years. No prodigal's return to his native north-eastern fields can have been more timely and auspicious than the one Robson finally made last autumn. </p> <p>Newcastle's red-hot hotbed was no place for the cool Dutchman Ruud Gullit, whose turbulent tenure came to a messy end in September with Newcastle prostrate in the Premiership with one single and laughable point from six matches. Without a farthing to buy a player, and with the club in hock to a stadium refurbishment as costly as it is grand, Robson has in 19 matches amassed 30 points - \"each one a separate little miracle,\" said the local Journal last week - and already almost brought a mid-table serenity. Plus, of course, Newcastle kick off tomorrow only two matches away from Wembley. </p> <p><strong> The warning shot</strong><br> </p> <p>An altogether separate miracle is Robson's bonny health. Having been cruelly denied by Diego Maradona's wicked \"Hand of God\" in 1986, and denied again four years later in that fevered World Cup semi-final shootout with Germany, Robson sought, and achieved, triumphs abroad. Then, five years ago while at Porto, he was diagnosed with cancer in his face. The operations were painful, and so was the treatment. </p> <p>\"Life-threatening? Oh, sure, twice,\" he says, matter of fact. Within a year he was managing Barcelona. He now looks as perkily fit as a flea. \"I'm 66, going on 46. Do you think I'd have taken on Newcastle if I wasn't 110%?\" </p> <p>On a sparkling blue-bright winter's morning at United's swish Chester-le-Street training ground, Robson is first in, hale, grinning and brimming with relish for the day. \"Man U last Saturday, Tranmere on Sunday: these are the most crucial days since I've been here,\" he enthuses. Then, on time and almost in convoy, in come the stream of players' limousines or four-wheel drives, each seemingly more sleek and expensive than the next. Some have chauffeurs. It is more like a motor-show parade than a football centre. Forty-two years ago, Robson celebrated his first cap for England by scraping together a \u00a350 deposit for his first car, a \u00a3200 secondhand Morris Minor. </p> <p>Some balletic \"light training\", choreographed by a businesslike Robson, is followed by lunch in the clubhouse. That spritely little talent and new talk of the Toon, Kieron Dyer, approaches his manager familiarly. </p> <p>\"Boss, d'you mind if I skip lunch? I've a photo commitment with England in Leeds this afternoon.\" </p> <p>\"Yes I do mind,\" Robson says firmly. \"You know lunch is between one and two, so you change and go and join your team-mates for it. Ring the people in Leeds and tell them Newcastle United comes first today, and having lunch together is part of the day's training. Then you can easily get down to Leeds.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, boss. Sorry, boss.\" </p> <p>\"Wherever I've managed [Fulham, Ipswich, England, PSV Eindhoven, Porto, Barcelona],\" Robson explains, \"my two watchwords have been order and discipline. I may be found wanting in other areas but those are my tenets. I arrive here and, for whatever reason, everything was slipshod, disordered, laissez-faire, and half the players didn't want to play with the other half. </p> <p>\"So I banned mobile phones. I said English must be the common language; it had been like a Tower of Babel. I insisted the whole team have lunch together. </p> <p>\"Players would drift into lunch, or not, in ones and twos. Others stuck in little cliques, talking their own language. There was a complete lack of comradeship. Now we all sit together, eat together, talk together. Nobody misses. And I must say, as a team-building exercise, the banter and range of conversation has been a joy to behold. And you can see this mutual regard manifesting itself under the most intense pressure on the field of play.\" </p> <p>He nods fondly towards top-of-the-table Alan Shearer, England's revitalised ace and a younger Geordie who came back to familiar fields. </p> <p>\"See, the natural leader, the strong personality. I tried to buy Alan for Barcelona when he was a world all-time great in 1996. Blackburn said 'no way' and Ray Harford told me not to mention to a soul I'd bid. 'Fair enough,' I said and I never did. Then a fortnight later Blackburn sold him to Newcastle. Was I furious? They'd have adored Alan in Barcelona. I had to buy Ronaldo instead for $20m. </p> <p><strong> Shearer revivified</strong><br> </p> <p>\"Alan didn't have the best of relationships with Ruud. They just couldn't gel. A tragedy: they both needed each other. The truth was, however, that Alan's game really had fallen away. I sat him down. Long, intense chats. We talked about his technique, his ambitions. I told him bluntly he'd stopped doing the things which had made him a genuine great. We agreed on a reappraisal, a complete overhaul. </p> <p>\"Some people told me that Newcastle were expecting Alan to do too much. I told them - and him - that he was doing too little, not doing half enough. I told him his whole movement had stopped, that he was just wearily working the parameters of the 18-yard line, going through the motions. Ruud had bought big Duncan [Ferguson] just for Alan, but whisperers said it was as a threat to Alan.\" </p> <p>The pepperpots and coffee cups are slid around the table. \"See how Alan's responded. It's sensational. He's coming in now from here - or here - or here. He's winging in from all angles, yet he's still in all the close-quartered places where it hurts. </p> <p>\"Look at his movement now, just a half-turn and he's away and clear. His running angles are terrific again, the crucial diagonals or, sometimes, the unstoppable straight line. He is hungry again, greedy for it.\" Shearer, of course, scored two and had one assist in Saturday's trouncing of Manchester United. </p> <p>Robson has always had the knack of giving encouragement to the great goalscorers. I first watched him play for West Brom in the 50s, England's athletic non-stop wing-half fetching and carrying for Ronnie Allen and Derek Kevan (one season the three of them shared 77 goals). At ulham in the early 60s he was the stylish head waiter to Johnny Haynes's maitre d'. </p> <p>I was on the Slough Observer and came to Craven Cottage to write a story on a local kid trialist. Nervously I knocked on the dressing-room door to ask if a first-team player would be photographed shaking hands with our boy. Haynes ignored me, so did Jim Langley, George Cohen and even young Rodney Marsh. But Robson came out, posed for the pic, then spent half an hour encouraging the youngster. That was Robson, enthusiast, romantic, good egg, emotional... plus, of course, order and discipline. </p> <p><strong> Going home</strong><br> </p> <p>Ruthless, too, when necessary. This week he put 13 of the vast Newcastle squad he inherited on the transfer list. He had done the same sort of thing 31 winters ago when he went to manage Ipswich and at once had a famous dressing-room fist-fight with two tempestuous old-soldier Celts, Bill Baxter and Tommy Carroll. They might have blacked his eyes - but they never played for Ipswich again. Nor did those who had cheered them on. </p> <p>So Robson was free to fashion at Portman Road one of the most successful European sides of the 70s. Which set him up for England - and those two notable World Cups in which he stuffed such Sun headlines as \"Plonker!\" and \"In the name of Allah go!\" back down the headline-writer's gullet. </p> <p>\"I've been lucky, haven't I? I played with Matthews and Finney, Haynes and Greaves. I managed Lineker and Robson and Gascoigne and Romario and Ronaldo... and Shearer. </p> <p>\"And I came home to England last May to plan my retirement, to put my feet up, watch a bit of cricket. June, July, August... then football starts again, and the hankerings begin, the pangs. </p> <p>\"I'd never experienced the passion, the pace, the international flavours of the Premiership. When Ruud was obviously on the way out here, I admit I 'let it be known' I was free. Only because it was Newcastle, mind, my very roots, my club, and my club was in a perilous position. </p> <p>\"After that I was worried to death I wouldn't get it. Couldn't sleep for worry. But they took the plunge on me for this season. </p> <p>\"I'm content in temporary furnished digs a couple of miles from where I was brought up. And now the chairman has drawn up a new contract. That's a pretty exciting 67th-birthday present, isn't it? That'll do me for my birthday.\" </p> <p>The taxi driver takes me the 10 miles to Durham station. \"Been seeing our Bobby?\" he says. \"I'm a good friend of his brother.\" </p> <p>On a sudden whim, he switches off the meter at the right fork to Langley Park: \"It's only a couple of miles extra. I'll show you where our Bobby used to live.\" And so he does. A tiny two-up ex-NCB cottage damply clamped in the very middle of a squashed, bleak, doll's house terrace. </p> <p>\"Bob's coming home has worked wonders already,\" says the taxi driver. \"You see, it's always been the case. Only a Geordie can really understand what football means to Geordies.\" </p> <p><strong>Bobby Robson is supporting the Portman Group's \"I'll be Des\" campaign, which encourages fans to designate a non-drinking driver whenever they go out to watch a match.</strong></p>",

Forty-two years ago, Robson celebrated his first cap for England by scraping together a \u00a350 deposit for his first car, a \u00a3200 secondhand Morris Minor. Some balletic \"light training\", choreographed by a businesslike Robson, is followed by lunch in the clubhouse. That spritely little talent and new talk of the Toon, Kieron Dyer, approaches his manager familiarly. \"Boss, d'you mind if I skip lunch? I've a photo commitment with England in Leeds this afternoon.\" \"Yes I do mind,\" Robson says firmly. \"You know lunch is between one and two, so you change and go and join your team-mates for it. Ring the people in Leeds and tell them Newcastle United comes first today, and having lunch together is part of the day's training. Then you can easily get down to Leeds.\" \"Yes, boss. Sorry, boss.\" \"Wherever I've managed [Fulham, Ipswich, England, PSV Eindhoven, Porto, Barcelona],\" Robson explains, \"my two watchwords have been order and discipline. I may be found wanting in other areas but those are my tenets. I arrive here and, for whatever reason, everything was slipshod, disordered, laissez-faire, and half the players didn't want to play with the other half. \"So I banned mobile phones. I said English must be the common language; it had been like a Tower of Babel. I insisted the whole team have lunch together. \"Players would drift into lunch, or not, in ones and twos. Others stuck in little cliques, talking their own language. There was a complete lack of comradeship. Now we all sit together, eat together, talk together. Nobody misses. And I must say, as a team-building exercise, the banter and range of conversation has been a joy to behold. And you can see this mutual regard manifesting itself under the most intense pressure on the field of play.\" He nods fondly towards top-of-the-table Alan Shearer, England's revitalised ace and a younger Geordie who came back to familiar fields. \"See, the natural leader, the strong personality. I tried to buy Alan for Barcelona when he was a world all-time great in 1996. Blackburn said 'no way' and Ray Harford told me not to mention to a soul I'd bid. 'Fair enough,' I said and I never did. Then a fortnight later Blackburn sold him to Newcastle. Was I furious? They'd have adored Alan in Barcelona. I had to buy Ronaldo instead for $20m. Shearer revivified \"Alan didn't have the best of relationships with Ruud. They just couldn't gel. A tragedy: they both needed each other. The truth was, however, that Alan's game really had fallen away. I sat him down. Long, intense chats. We talked about his technique, his ambitions. I told him bluntly he'd stopped doing the things which had made him a genuine great. We agreed on a reappraisal, a complete overhaul. \"Some people told me that Newcastle were expecting Alan to do too much. I told them - and him - that he was doing too little, not doing half enough. I told him his whole movement had stopped, that he was just wearily working the parameters of the 18-yard line, going through the motions. Ruud had bought big Duncan [Ferguson] just for Alan, but whisperers said it was as a threat to Alan.\" The pepperpots and coffee cups are slid around the table. \"See how Alan's responded. It's sensational. He's coming in now from here - or here - or here. He's winging in from all angles, yet he's still in all the close-quartered places where it hurts. \"Look at his movement now, just a half-turn and he's away and clear. His running angles are terrific again, the crucial diagonals or, sometimes, the unstoppable straight line. He is hungry again, greedy for it.\" Shearer, of course, scored two and had one assist in Saturday's trouncing of Manchester United. Robson has always had the knack of giving encouragement to the great goalscorers. I first watched him play for West Brom in the 50s, England's athletic non-stop wing-half fetching and carrying for Ronnie Allen and Derek Kevan (one season the three of them shared 77 goals). At ulham in the early 60s he was the stylish head waiter to Johnny Haynes's maitre d'. I was on the Slough Observer and came to Craven Cottage to write a story on a local kid trialist. Nervously I knocked on the dressing-room door to ask if a first-team player would be photographed shaking hands with our boy. Haynes ignored me, so did Jim Langley, George Cohen and even young Rodney Marsh. But Robson came out, posed for the pic, then spent half an hour encouraging the youngster. That was Robson, enthusiast, romantic, good egg, emotional... plus, of course, order and discipline. Going home Ruthless, too, when necessary. This week he put 13 of the vast Newcastle squad he inherited on the transfer list. He had done the same sort of thing 31 winters ago when he went to manage Ipswich and at once had a famous dressing-room fist-fight with two tempestuous old-soldier Celts, Bill Baxter and Tommy Carroll. They might have blacked his eyes - but they never played for Ipswich again. Nor did those who had cheered them on. So Robson was free to fashion at Portman Road one of the most successful European sides of the 70s. Which set him up for England - and those two notable World Cups in which he stuffed such Sun headlines as \"Plonker!\" and \"In the name of Allah go!\" back down the headline-writer's gullet. \"I've been lucky, haven't I? I played with Matthews and Finney, Haynes and Greaves. I managed Lineker and Robson and Gascoigne and Romario and Ronaldo... and Shearer. \"And I came home to England last May to plan my retirement, to put my feet up, watch a bit of cricket. June, July, August... then football starts again, and the hankerings begin, the pangs. \"I'd never experienced the passion, the pace, the international flavours of the Premiership. When Ruud was obviously on the way out here, I admit I 'let it be known' I was free. Only because it was Newcastle, mind, my very roots, my club, and my club was in a perilous position. \"After that I was worried to death I wouldn't get it. Couldn't sleep for worry. But they took the plunge on me for this season. \"I'm content in temporary furnished digs a couple of miles from where I was brought up. And now the chairman has drawn up a new contract. That's a pretty exciting 67th-birthday present, isn't it? That'll do me for my birthday.\" The taxi driver takes me the 10 miles to Durham station. \"Been seeing our Bobby?\" he says. \"I'm a good friend of his brother.\" On a sudden whim, he switches off the meter at the right fork to Langley Park: \"It's only a couple of miles extra. I'll show you where our Bobby used to live.\" And so he does. A tiny two-up ex-NCB cottage damply clamped in the very middle of a squashed, bleak, doll's house terrace. \"Bob's coming home has worked wonders already,\" says the taxi driver. \"You see, it's always been the case. Only a Geordie can really understand what football means to Geordies.\" Bobby Robson is supporting the Portman Group's \"I'll be Des\" campaign, which encourages fans to designate a non-drinking driver whenever they go out to watch a match.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Tuesday</strong> </p> <p>With no game this weekend we is on a week's R&amp;R at the El Dorado resort hotel, Morecambe, resting limbs exhausted by the continual round of legging it from reporters. Not to mention relaxing the muscles in the accelerator foot what have been strained by gunning the engine to get away from the prying lens of the paparazzi. </p> <p>I is in me bed recovering after a night of unwind when the mobe rings. \"All right, Rodders,\" I says when I've finally extricated it from under the tangle of limbs and clothing on the floor of me room what turns out to be Vic, Bob and several members of the Morecambe and district ladies rugby league team. \"What now?\" </p> <p>\"It's not Rodders, Dazz,\" says this voice. \"It's Tristan from BBC Hereford and Worcester. I'm doing a feature on footballers behaving badly and wondered if I might have your comments on last night's incident.\" </p> <p>\"Listen, mate, I never saw the incident. Where I was stood in the bar, there was absolutely no sign of any problem and any suggestion that, as the result of forfeits in a drinking game, Mick Watts leapt on to a table top wearing only the landlady's Wonderbra while one of the Bosnians gargled the Serb national anthem with his head immersed in a bucket of creme de menthe are entirely media speculation.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, right,\" says Tristan. \"Actually, Dazz, I was talking about Gazza breaking his arm smacking an opponent.\" </p> <p>\"Gazza?\" I says. \"When will he ever grow up?\" </p> <p><strong> Wednesday</strong> </p> <p>Spent most of last night helping Morecambe police with their inquiries. Only too glad to be of assistance, after Hermann and Darko got surrounded on the prom by a bunch of local lads what couldn't stop sniggering at their new Prada puffa jackets and Valentino ankle boots. </p> <p>\"As you'll appreciate, this is a very serious matter,\" says one of the dibble. \"At midnight last night two of the Greens squad were seen running in a northerly direction along the prom pursued by a pack of youths brandishing baseball bats, and in the chase one of said players was seen to raise what appeared to be a two-fingered salute. You will realise that we take such provocative behaviour very seriously and are obliged to investigate thoroughly.\" </p> <p>Phew, thank God for the dibbs, I think, as Hermann and Darko is led off. If it wasn't for their vigilance the yobs of Britain might be unable to go about the business of abusing footballers without fear of being subjected to a v-sign in response. </p> <p>After the dibbs has taken a DNA sample from us all (Wattsy already pants-filling in case they pass his on to the Child Support Agency) there's a training session on the beach to brush up on our dissent skills, followed by a stroll to the Greens' MegaStore on the prom and a work-out of the right wrist signing a stockpile of last year's duvet covers. And the media reckons we have it easy. </p> <p>Me signing duties is interrupted by Rodney belling. \"If you can drag yourself away from the fleshpots of Morecambe's Latin quarter tonight,\" he says, \"there's a long 'un to be had appearing on Ron Atkinson's new hard-hitting chat show on Central. The subject: whatever happened to loyalty in football?\" </p> <p>\"Sod that, Rodds,\" I says. \"What you doing about me new contract?

      "bodyText": "Tuesday With no game this weekend we is on a week's R&amp;R at the El Dorado resort hotel, Morecambe, resting limbs exhausted by the continual round of legging it from reporters. Not to mention relaxing the muscles in the accelerator foot what have been strained by gunning the engine to get away from the prying lens of the paparazzi. I is in me bed recovering after a night of unwind when the mobe rings. \"All right, Rodders,\" I says when I've finally extricated it from under the tangle of limbs and clothing on the floor of me room what turns out to be Vic, Bob and several members of the Morecambe and district ladies rugby league team. \"What now?\" \"It's not Rodders, Dazz,\" says this voice. \"It's Tristan from BBC Hereford and Worcester. I'm doing a feature on footballers behaving badly and wondered if I might have your comments on last night's incident.\" \"Listen, mate, I never saw the incident. Where I was stood in the bar, there was absolutely no sign of any problem and any suggestion that, as the result of forfeits in a drinking game, Mick Watts leapt on to a table top wearing only the landlady's Wonderbra while one of the Bosnians gargled the Serb national anthem with his head immersed in a bucket of creme de menthe are entirely media speculation.\" \"Oh, right,\" says Tristan. \"Actually, Dazz, I was talking about Gazza breaking his arm smacking an opponent.\" \"Gazza?\" I says. \"When will he ever grow up?\" Wednesday Spent most of last night helping Morecambe police with their inquiries. Only too glad to be of assistance, after Hermann and Darko got surrounded on the prom by a bunch of local lads what couldn't stop sniggering at their new Prada puffa jackets and Valentino ankle boots. \"As you'll appreciate, this is a very serious matter,\" says one of the dibble. \"At midnight last night two of the Greens squad were seen running in a northerly direction along the prom pursued by a pack of youths brandishing baseball bats, and in the chase one of said players was seen to raise what appeared to be a two-fingered salute. You will realise that we take such provocative behaviour very seriously and are obliged to investigate thoroughly.\" Phew, thank God for the dibbs, I think, as Hermann and Darko is led off. If it wasn't for their vigilance the yobs of Britain might be unable to go about the business of abusing footballers without fear of being subjected to a v-sign in response. After the dibbs has taken a DNA sample from us all (Wattsy already pants-filling in case they pass his on to the Child Support Agency) there's a training session on the beach to brush up on our dissent skills, followed by a stroll to the Greens' MegaStore on the prom and a work-out of the right wrist signing a stockpile of last year's duvet covers. And the media reckons we have it easy. Me signing duties is interrupted by Rodney belling. \"If you can drag yourself away from the fleshpots of Morecambe's Latin quarter tonight,\" he says, \"there's a long 'un to be had appearing on Ron Atkinson's new hard-hitting chat show on Central. The subject: whatever happened to loyalty in football?\" \"Sod that, Rodds,\" I says. \"What you doing about me new contract? Tell Mr Bleedin' So-called Chairman that if his club hasn't got the ambition to keep the likes of Darren Tackle, then Darren Tackle will be instructing his agent to find him a club what has.\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" says Rodney. \"I told him that six months ago.\" \"And? What did he say?\" \"Oh, is that the time?\" says Rodds. \"Must dash, got a call on me other line. Speakcha.\" \"Don't avoid the question,\" I says. \"What did he say?\" \"I've just told you, boy.

Wattsy has already opened a book on whether she's had a breast-enhancement surgery, and yours truly's been given the job of ringing Becks to get furthers and betters. \"Boob job?\" Becks says when I finally track him down to the Manchester branch of Nicole Farhi, where he's stocking up on Brooklyn's designer nappies. \"No, she's got a good job.

And once again they have left the country's best opening batsman behind. Presumptuous though it may seem to criticise the team selection of a nation that has just won seven Tests in a row, it doesn't mean there's no room for improvement.</p> <p>In an otherwise exemplary batting line-up, the opening partnership has failed, relatively speaking, to deliver the goods on several occasions. Nearly all the runs it has produced have come from Michael Slater, while Greg Blewett continues to look edgy and uncomfortable against the new ball. He was the only one of Australia's top seven not to help himself to a century against the rather ineffective bowling attacks of Pakistan and India during the recent series; he did manage two scores in the 80s, but then so did Shane Warne, batting at No.8. It might be time for a change at the top of the order, and although various names have been touted, nobody seems to have mentioned the obvious choice - Jamie Cox of Tasmania.</p> <p>Consider the evidence. First, Cox consistently scores lots of runs - his record of 10,445 first-class runs at 44.44 is easily comparable to Slater's and Blewett's. Secondly, he's in form - in his last two matches he has scored a quickfire 101 against Western Australia and a whopping 245 against New South Wales. But the important thing about Cox is not just the number of runs he scores, but the way in which he does it. He's been virtually carrying the entire Tasmanian order for a couple of years now: the once-prolific David Boon was definitely winding down towards the end of his career, Dene Hills hasn't been nearly as reliable as usual, Ricky Ponting is hardly ever available, and Michael Di Venuto is only just starting to come into his own as a supporting act. If Cox can produce that many runs under that sort of pressure, who can say how he would perform surrounded by players of a higher standard?</p> <p>Leaving him out of the New Zealand tour is foolish, and if he continues next season for Somerset where he left off last year it would be absolutely criminal to omit him from next year's Ashes squad. England's apparent policy of 'pick 'em and drop 'em' has been - quite rightly - criticised. But one chance is better than none, as Cox and others like him would probably testify. And the way he's been playing, one chance would probably be enough.</p> <p><em>Catherine Hanley, 27, teaches at Sheffield University, and is halfway through a PhD on medieval French literature and history. She comes from Australia, and supports Tasmania and Somerset, though she insists she was a Somerset fan before Cox took over the captaincy there last summer.</em></p>",

Nearly all the runs it has produced have come from Michael Slater, while Greg Blewett continues to look edgy and uncomfortable against the new ball. He was the only one of Australia's top seven not to help himself to a century against the rather ineffective bowling attacks of Pakistan and India during the recent series; he did manage two scores in the 80s, but then so did Shane Warne, batting at No.8. It might be time for a change at the top of the order, and although various names have been touted, nobody seems to have mentioned the obvious choice - Jamie Cox of Tasmania. Consider the evidence. First, Cox consistently scores lots of runs - his record of 10,445 first-class runs at 44.44 is easily comparable to Slater's and Blewett's. Secondly, he's in form - in his last two matches he has scored a quickfire 101 against Western Australia and a whopping 245 against New South Wales. But the important thing about Cox is not just the number of runs he scores, but the way in which he does it. He's been virtually carrying the entire Tasmanian order for a couple of years now: the once-prolific David Boon was definitely winding down towards the end of his career, Dene Hills hasn't been nearly as reliable as usual, Ricky Ponting is hardly ever available, and Michael Di Venuto is only just starting to come into his own as a supporting act. If Cox can produce that many runs under that sort of pressure, who can say how he would perform surrounded by players of a higher standard? Leaving him out of the New Zealand tour is foolish, and if he continues next season for Somerset where he left off last year it would be absolutely criminal to omit him from next year's Ashes squad. England's apparent policy of 'pick 'em and drop 'em' has been - quite rightly - criticised. But one chance is better than none, as Cox and others like him would probably testify. And the way he's been playing, one chance would probably be enough. Catherine Hanley, 27, teaches at Sheffield University, and is halfway through a PhD on medieval French literature and history. She comes from Australia, and supports Tasmania and Somerset, though she insists she was a Somerset fan before Cox took over the captaincy there last summer.",

      "body": "<p>The outfit was marvellously camp. It wasn't just the tight red swimming trunks peeking out from behind the red patterned loin-cloth that made me feel particularly outrageous. Nor was it the bracelets with their dangling red streamers, the wooden shoulder frame from which draped fake white fur, the two feathered wings, nor even the Roman centurion's hat made from plastic sea-shells. The extravagance was in the visual overload; the mix of the contemporary, the historical and the fantastical. Who was I supposed to be? An Amazonian indian god, Genghis Khan's gay younger brother or the flamboyant missing member of Village People? </p> <p>In fact, I was a figure inspired by the life of Anita Garibaldi, a Brazilian version of Joan of Arc - a local girl who married and fought alongside the 19th-century Italian freedom-fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi when he was in South America. Anita Garibaldi was something of a tough cookie - some would say flat and speckled with raisins - spending her honeymoon in armed naval conflict. </p> <p>Garibaldi has been mythologised as a warrior-heroine. As such, she is the perfect subject for mystical interpretation, hinting on wider themes such as religion, femininity and nationalism. When seen through the eyes of Jo\u00e3sinho Trinta, who designed the costumes, she could have been anything from a witch to a queen, a transvestite pop star or a jungle animal. Even though Garibaldi was the theme of Trinta's parade in 1999, the costumes said more about him than her. </p> <p>Trinta is also something of a myth in Brazilian culture. A tiny man, whose resemblence to a ventriloquist's puppet is accentuated by a paralysed arm, he's the one who many - himself especially - believe made the carnival parade the luxurious visual and cultural tour- de-force that it is today. Trinta is Brazil's most famous carnavalesco , the name given to the creative directors of each of the samba schools whose parades light up the Sambadrome through the carnival's steamy nights. Trinta was the first to camp up the performances, to make them a symbol of excess and extravagance. At first, commentators thought this an affront to the poverty of most of the people taking part, but it was the poor who adored it most of all. </p> <p>Sitting on the pavement in full regalia at 2am, awaiting my turn to dance down the Sambadrome's narrow arena, I pondered the irony that tourists like myself and rich Brazilians now paid high prices for appearing as lavishly attired as people who earn about \u00a350 a month. </p> <p>The analogy that is always used to describe how the carnival parade works is football. This is a doubly good explanation considering that football is about the only other thing most people know about Brazil. There are 14 main samba schools, and they function like football clubs - they have team colours, fanatical supporters and a home ground - the carnavalescos are the managers, and the carnival is like the league - an annual competition to see who is best. Every year, each school chooses a different theme and a different song to go with it. </p> <p>But the football analogy fails to capture the dimensions, organisational complications and artistic resonances of the event. I'd say think of Cecil B DeMille shooting a ballet as a Biblical epic - seven times a night, once for each of the seven samba schools who parade during the two principle nights. Each school's parade consists of around 4,000 people in about 40 different types of costume, with about seven enormous floats pushed along by teams (it's hard not to think of Biblical slaves or Roman galleons), choreographed dancers and a rhythm section of about 500 drummers. </p> <p>As well as the swelter of the humid climate, the atmosphere is prickled with the heat of excitement and competition. There is a constant pressure that everything is under scrutiny: the quality of the drumming, the way the carnavalesco has developed the theme, the tune of the samba being sung. The unregulated exuberance is, in fact, strictly regulated. If you dilly-dally down the Sambadrome, you are penalised. Everyone - even the foreigners who turn up - can lose the day for the team. </p> <p>To really enjoy the experience, it's best to come prepared. In my case, this was making sure my swimming trunks were bright red (to fit in with the rest of the costume) and learning the words to the samba (as you are expected to sing while you parade). I only knew I would be parading 24 hours before, so this meant getting a taped copy of the song and learning it by rote. </p> <p>The Sambadrome is a kilometre-long stretch of walkway with stands on either side. It was designed by Oscar Niemayer, the architect who created the concrete minimalist city of Brasilia. Backstage, so to speak, is central Rio's main avenue, where all the floats and the paraders wait for their turns. Here, it really does look like the set of an epic film. Tens of thousands of people in costume walking around, drinking beer, eating hotdogs as thousands of those who couldn't get tickets for the Sambadrome mingle and look on. </p> <p>I was to parade surrounded by about 40 other similarly attired people. As the zero hour approached, a member of the samba school who was in charge of our section came and gave us a pep talk. All we had to do was sing, dance and look happy. Easy. Well, not quite. At about 4am, the samba school I was with, Viradouro, moved into place at the beginning of the Sambadrome. We stood up, got in line and then heard our drummers kick off. As we started parading, Viradouro helpers lined the side of the avenue and, like the bike fans who giddy-up cyclists on the Tour de France, they yelled orders: \"Smile! Smile! Be Happy.\" I don't think I've ever looked so terrified. </p> <p>For about an hour, it was a total high. You can feel the sense of pride and happiness of both the paraders and the crowds by the looks on people's faces, by the interaction between the audience and the spectacle. On the tops of the floats are Brazilian celebrities and models. It's like a showcase of their own hopes and desires. Critics say that the carnival has sold out to tourists. I did not sense that at all. I felt it was an uncompromising celebration of Brazilianness. </p> <p>This did not exclude me from the party. Like many other parts of Brazilian life, the carnival fosters a communnal inclusivity you do not get in Europe. Brazil is not a country where people like to be different - perhaps because racially and socially, there is no country so diverse. People like to share, to be as one - and being a foreigner does not forbid you from feeling part of this. </p> <p>The carnival experience is not over when you walk out the Sambadrome, though. The climax is the judging a few days later, which is as drawn out and as melodramatic as the Eurovision Song Contest. Broadcast live on television from a stage on the Sambadrome - with cameras also positioned at every competing samba school, the city is glued to the screen. </p> <p> For such a popular occasion, much of the judging is steadfastly highbrow. (Give or take a few kickbacks between the mafia bosses who bankroll many of the schools). Experts in music, dance and art, historians and journalists are among those who do the scoring. The Brazilian equivalent of Terry Wogan comperes and milks every last drop of tension. The result marks the end of carnival, and the closing images are of hundreds of people swarming to the winning samba school to celebrate. </p> <p>Last year, unfortunately, the winner was not Viradouro, despite being one of the favourites. However, I feel fairly confident that my novice parading skills played no part in our downfall. We wuz robbed. </p> <p><strong>Don't just stand and watch</strong></p> <p>Carnival 2000 takes place from Saturday March 4 to Tuesday March 7. All the samba schools have chosen themes related to the 500th anniversary of the first Europeans landing in Brazil. </p> <p>On the two main nights, Sunday and Monday, 14 samba schools parade, each made up of about 4,000 people - which makes 56,000 dressed in ridiculous outfits, or the largest fancy dress party in the world. There is always space for some tourists. </p> <p>Within each school's parade, there are several different sections with separate costumes, each called an \"ala\". Some will be just for members of the community where the school is based, but others will be open to anyone who is willing to pay. In fact, the latter subsidise the former by charging middle-class Brazilians and foreigners quite large fees for the costumes, whereas local people get theirs free. </p> <p>You can pay anything from \u00a350 for a simple costume from one of the less glamorous schools, to more than \u00a3100 for one from the top schools. </p> <p>Travel agencies sometimes arrange a costume as part of a package. But once you are in Rio, you can do it yourself. Ask your hotel receptionist to call the alas who are selling outfits. Once you've got your costume, you learn the words to the school's song and turn up in time on the day. </p> <p>This year, the process has been made simpler thanks to the internet, where some of the big schools have their own websites. The most detailed is by the <a href=\"http://www.salgueiro.com.br\">Salgueiro samba school</a>, which has a list of almost all the costumes from all 44 of its alas. Previously, each school's costumes were a closely-guarded secret. </p> <p>You can chose to be Napoleon, an Indian spice merchant, a botanical garden, or even \"Beneficent England\" - dressed in red stockings, with a Union Jack coming out your back and a globe on your head.

The pre-dinner drinks, according to David Niven, \"flowed like glue\". Anyone who managed to get drunk - Errol Flynn and Dorothy Parker were two lucky ones - would return to their rooms to find their bags packed and a car waiting to take them to the station. </p> <p>\"Life in this Hearstian empire,\" wrote the socialite Gloria Vanderbilt, \"is lived according to the disciplinary measures laid down by its dictator.\" </p> <p>There were a few dissidents, such as the guest who, when asked one morning if he wanted to ride, motor, shoot, golf, swim or play tennis, replied firmly: \"Not if I can help it.\" </p> <p>And it seems that when Hearst retired to his library to telegram instructions to his newspapers deep into the night, the more spirited guests would sneak off to the steamy, gold-tiled indoor pool for boozy parties. </p> <p>Hearst indulged his every whim, and the eminent San Francisco architect Julia Morgan patiently went along with it all, year after year. The swimming pool was rebuilt three times, the foundations of the main house were moved at huge expense to make room for a bowling alley that was never built. </p> <p>Davies and some of the women guests often did jigsaw puzzles in the Assembly Room after dinner, and on one occasion a skilled carpenter and painter were brought in to make a perfect replacement for a tiny lost piece. \"Afterwards, nine chances out of 10, it was shoved in the wastepapaper basket,\" the carpenter commented later. </p> <p>Nowadays, the hordes of mass tourism have taken the place of the beautiful people at Hearst Castle, but a whiff of the old man's authoritarianism lingers on.

The loot of the world arrived here by the shipload. Often it was never unpacked, let alone looked at. </p> <p>But one thing you won't find mentioned in the official guidebooks is the Orson Welles film, Citizen Kane, in which a super-rich newspaper magnate fails to achieve his political ambitions and tries to console himself by building a huge castle. </p> <p>There was never any doubt that the character of Kane started with Hearst, who had twice failed to become mayor of New York and win the Democratic presidential nomination. The great man instructed his columnists to attack Welles and used his influence in Hollywood to try to block the film's distribution.

In particular, the central device of the film - that Kane's psychological scar comes from his deprivation in early childhood of his beloved snowsled Rosebud - seems to have had very little to do with Hearst, who had never been deprived of anything. (The story that Rosebud was Hearst's pet name for Marion Davies's clitoris is widely regarded as a red herring.) </p> <p>Film writer David Thomson argues in his book Rosebud that Kane's complicated, self-destructive character is closer to Welles himself than Hearst: \"Some other resemblance developed behind the showy but superficial kinship of Kane and Hearst.

      "body": "<p>The sound of steel drums drifts over French Revolution Square, where locals sip cold drinks under caf\u00e9 awnings, a welcome relief from the hot afternoon sun. Within the walls of the old monastery, crowds of children dance to West Indian melodies. However, this is not some former French colony in the Caribbean, but Ljubljana, capital of the former Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia, and the musicians are British, a bunch of north London schoolkids called the Dollis Deep Pans. </p> <p>And this is not some war-torn Balkan city, but the hub of what prides itself on being the most stable and prosperous country in eastern Europe. </p> <p>The British Council - the UK's international organisation for educational and cultural relations - brought the steel band over to participate in the Druga Godba (\"the other music\") international music festival. </p> <p>If you ever needed a reason to visit Ljubjana in early June, this is a perfect excuse. Not only is it one of the most vibrant festivals anywhere in Europe, it also takes place in a stunning setting, the Krizanker Summer Theatre. </p> <p>The complex is in the ruins of an old Teutonic monastery, rebuilt by Slovenia's most famous architect Joze Plecnik, whose eclectic neo-classicism allowed him to express his religious beliefs without too much disapproval from the Communist government. The open-air auditorium has a retractable roof, and one of its structural elements is the remains of the old city wall, from the Roman settlement of Emona. </p> <p>At last year's Druga Godba, the 15th, music from Europe and the Balkans mixed with Vietnamese, African, South American and Caribbean. Twenty-four groups played over nine days, and soloists included Senegalese singer Baaba Maal, Mali's Rokia Troare, Angola's Waldemar Bastos and Britain's DJ Vitu's Asian Equation, back by popular demand after a sell-out show the previous year. </p> <p>Ljubljana is easily accessible and on a human scale, like a smaller version of Prague or Budapest, but without the commercialism and compromises to mass tourism. </p> <p>Slovenia has been badly affected by a downturn in tourism since the break-up of Yugoslavia. In 1989, the Postojna caves in Slovenia's Karst region had more than a million visitors. Two years later, it was only 40,000, and the Kosovo crisis made matters worse, even though Slovenia was not directly involved in the conflict. </p> <p>It claims to be the most heavily wooded country in Europe, with more than half its area covered in forests. And it is possibly the only place in the world where forest cover is increasing, as hill farming is no longer economic and pastureland is being reclaimed by trees. </p> <p>The country's compact size -roughly that of Wales -means that almost everywhere can be reached within a few hours. And these places are worth reaching. In winter, Triglav National Park, in the Julian Alps, boasts some fine ski centres, but by June the snow has receded to the peaks and the rivers reach their fullest.

      "bodyText": "The sound of steel drums drifts over French Revolution Square, where locals sip cold drinks under caf\u00e9 awnings, a welcome relief from the hot afternoon sun. Within the walls of the old monastery, crowds of children dance to West Indian melodies. However, this is not some former French colony in the Caribbean, but Ljubljana, capital of the former Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia, and the musicians are British, a bunch of north London schoolkids called the Dollis Deep Pans. And this is not some war-torn Balkan city, but the hub of what prides itself on being the most stable and prosperous country in eastern Europe. The British Council - the UK's international organisation for educational and cultural relations - brought the steel band over to participate in the Druga Godba (\"the other music\") international music festival. If you ever needed a reason to visit Ljubjana in early June, this is a perfect excuse. Not only is it one of the most vibrant festivals anywhere in Europe, it also takes place in a stunning setting, the Krizanker Summer Theatre. The complex is in the ruins of an old Teutonic monastery, rebuilt by Slovenia's most famous architect Joze Plecnik, whose eclectic neo-classicism allowed him to express his religious beliefs without too much disapproval from the Communist government. The open-air auditorium has a retractable roof, and one of its structural elements is the remains of the old city wall, from the Roman settlement of Emona. At last year's Druga Godba, the 15th, music from Europe and the Balkans mixed with Vietnamese, African, South American and Caribbean. Twenty-four groups played over nine days, and soloists included Senegalese singer Baaba Maal, Mali's Rokia Troare, Angola's Waldemar Bastos and Britain's DJ Vitu's Asian Equation, back by popular demand after a sell-out show the previous year. Ljubljana is easily accessible and on a human scale, like a smaller version of Prague or Budapest, but without the commercialism and compromises to mass tourism. Slovenia has been badly affected by a downturn in tourism since the break-up of Yugoslavia. In 1989, the Postojna caves in Slovenia's Karst region had more than a million visitors. Two years later, it was only 40,000, and the Kosovo crisis made matters worse, even though Slovenia was not directly involved in the conflict. It claims to be the most heavily wooded country in Europe, with more than half its area covered in forests. And it is possibly the only place in the world where forest cover is increasing, as hill farming is no longer economic and pastureland is being reclaimed by trees. The country's compact size -roughly that of Wales -means that almost everywhere can be reached within a few hours. And these places are worth reaching. In winter, Triglav National Park, in the Julian Alps, boasts some fine ski centres, but by June the snow has receded to the peaks and the rivers reach their fullest. This is the time to head for the town of Bovec, centre of \"Adrenaline valley\", for white-water rafting and canoeing. Piran is a beautiful Venetian town on the short stretch of coast. Kobarid - Caporetto in Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms - is set in the stunning Soca valley. Lake Bled, with its island church and clifftop castle, shouldn't be missed, but much less visited and even more beautiful are the nearby Lake Bohinj and Lake Cerknica, whose annual disappearance puzzled scholars for centuries. \u0095 This year's Druga Godba international festival of alternative and ethno music will be held from June 3-10. The practicals Slovenjia Pursuits (01767 631144) has tailor-made holidays to Slovenia.

Berber village, Tunisia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>A night in Tunisia, sang Ella Fitzgerald, is \"a tale/Too exotic to be told\". Perhaps the composer of that tune, Dizzy Gillespie, had spent the night in question tuning his zither - all 72 strings of it, making the phrase a wry Tunisian euphemism for sensual indulgence. The \"desert sand\" of the song, beloved also of Star Wars fans (Luke Skywalker's home planet, Tatooine, is a real southern Tunisian place name) is worlds away from the lush sub-tropical greenery of the capital in the north. Yet if it's not quite camel-trekking in the starlit Sahara, a weekend in Tunis still makes for a warmly exotic winter retreat. </p> <p>At the centre of the city is the medina, the walled old town founded 13 centuries ago and now designated a Unesco World Heritage site. You can spend most of a day exploring its warren of low, arched stone passageways. Shops selling carpets, leather, silverware, khaftans and jewellery are festooned with twinkling fairy lights; strings of scarves and multi-coloured beads hang from rods spanning the width of the alleys. Tunisians everywhere are engaged in the long game of barter: a prospective buyer feigns outrage with an amicable bark and begins to walk away; the stallholder calls confidently that he'll be back. Down another passageway, a grinning old man displays racks of traditional headwear, shashia and fez, and - a commercially necessary modern barbarism, it seems - baseball caps made from the same purple-dyed wool. </p> <p>Some of the shops here are still laid out as old medina houses: one delightfully eclectic antique emporium, CD Dar, offers swords in an urn, old cameras and flintlock rifles, a squeezebox or an organ. From its roof terrace, you can peer out over the top of the medina: a skyline decorated with glazed green rooftiles and a forest of slender spires and domes. Below, the frenetic activity of the souks is invisible under the undulating stone roofs, whose interlocking curves begin to resemble patterns in the dunes. </p> <p>It's worth deliberately wandering off the busiest shop-and-caf\u00e9 routes: some alleys are peacefully deserted, and sunlight bludgeons through gaps in the roofs to wash the stone in captivating shades of russet and gold. Dart down one such and you come across the Mus\u00e9e des Arts, a lovingly-preserved 19th-century bourgeois household with chandeliers, gilded furniture and exquisitely-tiled walls, laid out in the old way around a central courtyard. To aid historical visualisation, each room hosts a tableau of waxwork dummies dressed in their finest robes and jewels. </p> <p>There is no point trying to plan a route through the medina: although attractions such as the museum are helpfully signposted around the central Zitouna Mosque, it's not the sort of place where you'd purposefully march from A to B and cross off the sights. You might be led off course by the promise of a prickly pear or by the heady intermingled wafts of sizzling food and perfumeries (the prophet Mohammed, it is said, disdained wealth and power, but confessed two weaknesses: women and scent). And, at regular intervals, the chatter of commerce and idle gossip in Arabic, French and English, mixed with the polite shouts of men trying to wheel enormous, glistening fish past you on the dark, slippery cobbles, is joined by transistorised minarets, and the crowds begin to move with more purpose as the faithful heed the call to prayer. </p> <p>Lunch should be savoured opposite the main entrance of the central mosque, at the ridiculously cheap Restaurant Mahdaoui, which serves delicious fried tuna with egg in tomato sauce, or lamb couscous. Later, out of the medina and on to the street as sunset approaches, the main Avenue Habib Bourguiba, thronged with tourists, street performers and promenading Tunisians, fills with a symphonic cheeping. Thousands of starlings flock here every day at this hour, swooping hungrily among the olive trees, passing ecstatically high-pitched judgment on the quality of the fruit. The terrace of Hotel Africa - at four stories, once the tallest building in Tunis - will happily furnish beer while you watch them wheeling through the warm evening air. </p> <p> 'To Carthage then I came . . .\" Even the venerable medina is a brash architectural upstart next to the remains of the citadel here that once ruled as much of the Mediterranean as anyone thought important enough to subjugate. </p> <p>What's left of the ancient city of Carthage perches in Ozymandian grandeur atop a hill to the east of modern Tunis. This is where, according to legend, Dido arrived on the run from Tyre nearly three millennia ago: the local king told her she could have as much land as could be covered by an ox-hide. Resourcefully, she cut the skin into thin strips and stretched it all around the top of the hill. </p> <p>Proud Carthage, of course, was eventually sacked by the vandals of Rome, and the replacement Roman city, in a kind of historical poetic justice, was later kicked down by the Vandals themselves. For centuries afterwards, its remains were looted for building material, and gradually overtaken by agricultural use. Now, from the top of Mount Byrsa (which translates as ox-hide), you can inspect the poignantly-deserted grid layout of a Punic village, with some mosaic floors still intact, and gaze across at the twin ports through which all the sea's wealth passed. </p> <p>There are still some massive stone catapult balls strewn around the acropolis, silently mourning their failure to protect the city. Behind you, the Museum of Carthage is filled with fascinating artefacts from the Punic, Roman and Byzantine eras, and behind that is the enormous, near-decadent 19th-century French basilica. </p> <p>Just down the hill are the spectacular ruins of the Antonine thermal baths, among whose maze of dank vaults it is easy to lose yourself in reveries of imperial watersports. A single main column of the frigidarium , or cold pool, spears 45ft up into the cobalt sky: the original building is thought to have been twice as high as that. </p> <p>If you have the time, it's also certainly worth the four-hour round trip south of Tunis to the extraordinary site of Dougga, an entire Roman town complete with vertiginous mountain-top amphitheatre, a capitol, a temple to Celeste and a mausoleum whose bilingual inscription, now in the British Museum, was vital in the first efforts to decode the Punic language. </p> <p>All this stamping around, of course, eventually brings on a yearning to put one's feet up in a caf\u00e9 and suck on an enormous bong. That, it seems, is what the darling village of Sidi Bou Said was built for, piled up delicately on a rosy-clay cliffside just north of Byrsa. Palm trees fondly wave their inedible golden dates and the narrow, steep streets are lined with buildings that are all washed dazzling white, with sky-blue woodwork - not by accident but by law, an aesthetic edict that curiously manages to avoid the twee. From this sky-village, you can watch the fishermen on the beach below spread their multi-coloured nets, undulating like giant jellyfish, and look across the bay to the twin-horned mountain that has hurried generations of Tunisian artists to the canvas. </p> <p>But winding down on your last afternoon in Tunis, you'll probably leave the watercolour set at home. Wander up instead to the Caf\u00e9 El Alia and try a shisha , or water-pipe, with your coffee.

      "bodyText": "A night in Tunisia, sang Ella Fitzgerald, is \"a tale/Too exotic to be told\". Perhaps the composer of that tune, Dizzy Gillespie, had spent the night in question tuning his zither - all 72 strings of it, making the phrase a wry Tunisian euphemism for sensual indulgence. The \"desert sand\" of the song, beloved also of Star Wars fans (Luke Skywalker's home planet, Tatooine, is a real southern Tunisian place name) is worlds away from the lush sub-tropical greenery of the capital in the north. Yet if it's not quite camel-trekking in the starlit Sahara, a weekend in Tunis still makes for a warmly exotic winter retreat. At the centre of the city is the medina, the walled old town founded 13 centuries ago and now designated a Unesco World Heritage site. You can spend most of a day exploring its warren of low, arched stone passageways. Shops selling carpets, leather, silverware, khaftans and jewellery are festooned with twinkling fairy lights; strings of scarves and multi-coloured beads hang from rods spanning the width of the alleys. Tunisians everywhere are engaged in the long game of barter: a prospective buyer feigns outrage with an amicable bark and begins to walk away; the stallholder calls confidently that he'll be back. Down another passageway, a grinning old man displays racks of traditional headwear, shashia and fez, and - a commercially necessary modern barbarism, it seems - baseball caps made from the same purple-dyed wool. Some of the shops here are still laid out as old medina houses: one delightfully eclectic antique emporium, CD Dar, offers swords in an urn, old cameras and flintlock rifles, a squeezebox or an organ. From its roof terrace, you can peer out over the top of the medina: a skyline decorated with glazed green rooftiles and a forest of slender spires and domes. Below, the frenetic activity of the souks is invisible under the undulating stone roofs, whose interlocking curves begin to resemble patterns in the dunes. It's worth deliberately wandering off the busiest shop-and-caf\u00e9 routes: some alleys are peacefully deserted, and sunlight bludgeons through gaps in the roofs to wash the stone in captivating shades of russet and gold. Dart down one such and you come across the Mus\u00e9e des Arts, a lovingly-preserved 19th-century bourgeois household with chandeliers, gilded furniture and exquisitely-tiled walls, laid out in the old way around a central courtyard. To aid historical visualisation, each room hosts a tableau of waxwork dummies dressed in their finest robes and jewels. There is no point trying to plan a route through the medina: although attractions such as the museum are helpfully signposted around the central Zitouna Mosque, it's not the sort of place where you'd purposefully march from A to B and cross off the sights. You might be led off course by the promise of a prickly pear or by the heady intermingled wafts of sizzling food and perfumeries (the prophet Mohammed, it is said, disdained wealth and power, but confessed two weaknesses: women and scent). And, at regular intervals, the chatter of commerce and idle gossip in Arabic, French and English, mixed with the polite shouts of men trying to wheel enormous, glistening fish past you on the dark, slippery cobbles, is joined by transistorised minarets, and the crowds begin to move with more purpose as the faithful heed the call to prayer. Lunch should be savoured opposite the main entrance of the central mosque, at the ridiculously cheap Restaurant Mahdaoui, which serves delicious fried tuna with egg in tomato sauce, or lamb couscous. Later, out of the medina and on to the street as sunset approaches, the main Avenue Habib Bourguiba, thronged with tourists, street performers and promenading Tunisians, fills with a symphonic cheeping. Thousands of starlings flock here every day at this hour, swooping hungrily among the olive trees, passing ecstatically high-pitched judgment on the quality of the fruit. The terrace of Hotel Africa - at four stories, once the tallest building in Tunis - will happily furnish beer while you watch them wheeling through the warm evening air. 'To Carthage then I came . . .\" Even the venerable medina is a brash architectural upstart next to the remains of the citadel here that once ruled as much of the Mediterranean as anyone thought important enough to subjugate. What's left of the ancient city of Carthage perches in Ozymandian grandeur atop a hill to the east of modern Tunis. This is where, according to legend, Dido arrived on the run from Tyre nearly three millennia ago: the local king told her she could have as much land as could be covered by an ox-hide. Resourcefully, she cut the skin into thin strips and stretched it all around the top of the hill. Proud Carthage, of course, was eventually sacked by the vandals of Rome, and the replacement Roman city, in a kind of historical poetic justice, was later kicked down by the Vandals themselves. For centuries afterwards, its remains were looted for building material, and gradually overtaken by agricultural use. Now, from the top of Mount Byrsa (which translates as ox-hide), you can inspect the poignantly-deserted grid layout of a Punic village, with some mosaic floors still intact, and gaze across at the twin ports through which all the sea's wealth passed. There are still some massive stone catapult balls strewn around the acropolis, silently mourning their failure to protect the city. Behind you, the Museum of Carthage is filled with fascinating artefacts from the Punic, Roman and Byzantine eras, and behind that is the enormous, near-decadent 19th-century French basilica. Just down the hill are the spectacular ruins of the Antonine thermal baths, among whose maze of dank vaults it is easy to lose yourself in reveries of imperial watersports. A single main column of the frigidarium , or cold pool, spears 45ft up into the cobalt sky: the original building is thought to have been twice as high as that. If you have the time, it's also certainly worth the four-hour round trip south of Tunis to the extraordinary site of Dougga, an entire Roman town complete with vertiginous mountain-top amphitheatre, a capitol, a temple to Celeste and a mausoleum whose bilingual inscription, now in the British Museum, was vital in the first efforts to decode the Punic language. All this stamping around, of course, eventually brings on a yearning to put one's feet up in a caf\u00e9 and suck on an enormous bong. That, it seems, is what the darling village of Sidi Bou Said was built for, piled up delicately on a rosy-clay cliffside just north of Byrsa. Palm trees fondly wave their inedible golden dates and the narrow, steep streets are lined with buildings that are all washed dazzling white, with sky-blue woodwork - not by accident but by law, an aesthetic edict that curiously manages to avoid the twee. From this sky-village, you can watch the fishermen on the beach below spread their multi-coloured nets, undulating like giant jellyfish, and look across the bay to the twin-horned mountain that has hurried generations of Tunisian artists to the canvas. But winding down on your last afternoon in Tunis, you'll probably leave the watercolour set at home. Wander up instead to the Caf\u00e9 El Alia and try a shisha , or water-pipe, with your coffee. Songbirds in cages philosophise melodically about the idea of freedom, and ornate bronze lanterns swing gently from the rafters. No one seems to be in a hurry in Tunis - and why should they be? Ancient history is scattered in plain view over the soil: no clearer illustration could be wished for of the fact that everything is in flux, that a single human lifespan is so brief as to win forgiveness for the incorrigible daydreamer. You think again of Ella's song - \"The cares of the day seem to vanish\" - and decide that, yes, it fits here just as well. Five of the best Places to eat 1 Mahdaoui (Rue Jamaa ez Zitouna): Delicious and very cheap traditional Tunisian food, popular with civil servants. 2 Dar Bel Hadj (17 Rue des Tamis): Stunning old courtyard townhouse serving exquisite food with live music. 3 Au Bon Vieux Temps (56 Rue Hedi Zarrouk, Sidi Bou Said): Fabulous sea view from this airy Sidi Bou Said eaterie. 4 Caf\u00e9 Sidi Meht (Medina): Ideal place to rest your legs during a day wandering the souks. 5 Caf\u00e9 El Alia (Sidi Bou Said): Gorgeously relaxing hill-top retreat in the village of the sky.

      "body": "<p>It was Saturday night in the Indian Ocean. The sails were full of the south-west trades, there were moonbeams on the masts and stars in the sky; the sea was thick and dark, the wind warm. From below came the sound of the bagpipes. </p> <p>Not only the sound of the bagpipes, but the bagpipes played by a German sea captain who lives in Scotland and sports a kilt. He loves the sea and ship so much, he was sailing as a passenger. </p> <p>We were miles from anywhere, doing about six knots. The ocean stretched far beyond the bowsprit. Our next landfall, after navigating the passage between Nicobar and the Andamans, would be the uninhabited Similan Islands. There were worse places to be. </p> <p>The Star Flyer - 2,200 tonnes, 350ft from figure head to stern - was on the longest passage made these days by a ship under sail. She began her 35-day voyage in Athens, called in at Alexandria, went through Suez to Aden and Oman and then set out across the Arabian Sea, the first stretch of the Indian Ocean. I joined her at the iron-ore port of Vasco da Gama in India for the second sea crossing to Thailand. </p> <p>She is a strong, beautiful and romantic ship, built on clipper lines, but she lay, unromantically, among grimy ore carriers, with red dust flying from the loading hoppers on the quay. The German skipper, Captain Gerhardt Lickfelt, regarded the peppery coating on his deck and sniffed. He wanted to get going. </p> <p>We sailed due south, along the hilly coast. At her swiftest, the Star Flyer carves the ocean at 13 knots, all her masts crammed with sail, and with the wavering givaway of a pennant of smoke issuing from the rear mast. It doubles as a slim funnel for the auxiliary diesel engine. You can lie on the sun-bleached deck and, if you have nothing better to do, which may well be the case, you can name the sails (36,000 square feet of them): the top gallants, the jigger, the mizzen fisherman and the rest. Ropes and blocks and belaying pins make enticing patterns in the ocean sun. The bar is circular, half of the curve outside, half inside. You can drink whatever the weather. </p> <p>We called at Cochin, tying up at Wilmington Island, among the lagoons - an island made by the British from the silt dredged from a new harbour and handily finished in time for Indian independence. Then we made our way past Cape Comorin, the most southerly point of India, with its giant, white church, down to Colombo and eventually went out into the open ocean. </p> <p>The trades took us by the hand and led us on. The bow nosed hungrily at the easy waves. Settling in at sea, knowing that the next landfall was six days away, was wonderful. The cabins were on the small side, the bathrooms like Houdini cabinets, but done out in teak and brass. There was a television that showed videos, but it was never turned on. News came via a daily sheet, which was placed in the library, but few people bothered. Now was the time for talking. </p> <p>We heard tales of the ship's crossing of the Arabian Sea, the first indent of the Indian Ocean, on the stretch before I joined. The 150 passengers, and 72 crew had come across fishermen in boats, tiny, each one hardly bigger than a man, and days from land, who did a quick deal for a 100lb silvery marlin they had caught. The ship had stopped so everyone could swim in the ocean. </p> <p>There are not many rules on the Star Flyer. You know where your lifeboat station is and a notice reminds passengers not to light candles in the cabins, a sensible precaution on a wooden ship. All day we sailed, stretched out on the deck or searched the horizon for other ships, which mostly kept well below it. You could learn navigation or how to raise the sails or tie knots; you could lie on your front in the net below the bowsprit and watch the dolphins. There is not much else to do except read and sniff the air. Food was lavish and stretched from morning bacon to the last drifting whiff of dinner. </p> <p>Everybody loved the ship but no one more than the officers and crew. Most of them have been aboard for years. The passengers were mainly German and American with a sprinkling of other Europeans. The ages were on the northern side of 60. </p> <p>The day before we disembarked in Phuket, Thailand, the clipper hove-to off a low, green group of nine islands, the Similan Islands.

      "body": "<p>Izzethin Gundogdu was once a boatman who transported goods and passengers in his animal-hide craft along the River Tigris in the far south-eastern corner of Turkey. Years ago, when he was a young man, he passed through a village where he saw some men lowering ropes into the waters. He asked them what they were doing. One day, they told him, a dam would be built there. He did not believe it. \"Not then, not now,\" he says. But - whatever Gundogdu, or indeed anyone else living in the area may think - the dam is likely to be a reality by the end of the decade: 25,000 people will be forced off their land and out of their homes, and the ancient Kurdish town of Hasankeyf will drown beneath the waters of a vast 300-square-kilometre lake flooding the Tigris valley. And all thanks to the British government, which is \"minded\" to provide financial guarantees worth \u00a3200 million. </p> <p>Turkey is desperate for energy. The proposed Ilisu Dam a few kilometres downstream from Hasankeyf is the final stage of a project first conceived in the 50s to create hydroelectricity from a series of dams on the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. From the Kurdish point of view, it is the equivalent of the EU planning to flood an area that includes Stonehenge on the grounds that it would benefit the energy needs of western Europe. \"This is where we were born and where we grew up,\" says Gundogdu, sitting drinking glasses of tea with the other old men of the town. \"There is no difference between young and old. We don't want this dam!\" </p> <p>In a back-street grocery shop - a little room selling wool, buttons, oil, biscuits, margarine - a 66-year-old woman says to me, \"My name is Makbule Kocaman. Write it down big. And write down big that the dam is sin, that we don't want any dam, that we don't want to live after Hasankeyf. It is the flower of all the world.\" </p> <p>Hasankeyf, with a population of 5,500, lies in southern Anatolia, near the Iraqi and Syrian borders. From the early 90s until very recently, the area has been under a state of emergency because of the war between the Turkish government and the PKK, the Kurdish separatist organisation founded by Abdullah Ocalan in 1978. Few people have been to Hasankeyf, and probably no one from the current British government or its recent predecessors. It is a blighted place. It is one of the few towns in Turkey without a bank. For 20 years, Hasankeyf has had no inward investment because everyone knew that the dam was coming and that the town would be destroyed. Despite the ceasefire that began last summer after Ocalan's capture, the region remains classified as medium-risk. </p> <p>Within minutes of our arrival in Batman, the nearest town to Hasankeyf with an airport, we were joined by three plain-clothes police who remained with us each day from breakfast until they were sure we had gone to bed - for our own protection, so they told us. </p> <p>On the road to Hasankeyf, you pass through low, dry, brown mountains and parched land that seems incapable of producing life. The villages along the way are said to be PKK strongholds - the two choices the young men of the region have had until now are to go west to work in the tourist resorts on Turkey's Aegean coast, or to go to the mountains to join the PKK rebels. Theirs is an old conflict dating back to the 20s, when Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, began the policy of assimilation, of suppression of the Kurdish language or any manifestation of Kurdish culture. The war may now finally be at an end: last week, the PKK formally abandoned its separatist rebellion in favour of a democratic political programme. Rebel commanders have declared the ceasefire permanent. </p> <p>Hasankeyf lies alongside a gorge spanned by a ruined bridge across the Tigris. Into the cliffs are carved mosques and palaces and gateways and caves in which may be hidden archaeological remains that go back 10,000 years. Hasankeyf is really two places: the ancient ruins and the modern town, where today's doomed inhabitants live. The first, a city founded by the Romans as an eastern bastion of Asia Minor, climbs up either side of the pink-stone gorge. It was a bishopric in Byzantium until, in 640AD, conquering Arabs changed its name from Cephe to Hisn Kayfa. During the 12th century, the Aturkid Turcomans made it the capital of their realm, which it remained until 1260, when the Mongols arrived. It was then ruled by a clan of Kurdish chieftains until it became part of the Ottoman empire in the 15th century. </p> <p>It is the sheer scale of the place that impresses, as well as the tiers of caves rising up on either side of the river in which people have been living since prehistoric times. Today, families live in the caves because they have no money to rent houses. The children haul water up the cliffside on donkeys. The men recently managed to drag up a cable to bring electricity to the caves, but the women, cut off from the town where only men are allowed to visit the marketplace and buy food, are lonely. </p> <p>Hasankeyf is barely mentioned in guide books. It is as if it does not exist, except in the minds of archaeologists and its own tiny population. A couple of years ago, according to a local restaurant owner, an Israeli woman found her way to Hasankeyf, fell in love with the place and decided she would like to live there for a year or two. On her first day she was arrested, on the second she was stopped by the police, on the third day she left, convinced that the authorities would not tolerate foreigners in the area. </p> <p>The modern town is dilapidated, an ugly sprawl of two-storey stone or concrete houses built along rutted roads. The sour taste of extreme poverty pervades everything. The largest, most modern structures are the police station and the police barracks. \"Our school is in a very safe place,\" a small boy says dryly. \"We have police on either side of us.\" Unemployment is said to run at 90% at least. There are no state benefits in Turkey, so people survive by keeping animals for milk and meat, herding the sheep and goats into the caves when the weather is harsh, growing vegetables and raising much-needed cash by sending their sons to the resorts in the summer, where they serve shish kebabs to British and German tourists. Three generations of unemployed men huddle around the metal stoves in the town's coffee shops. There are no women to be seen. There is a secret path through the town, so they can visit their family unobserved, but I never found it. Only on the outskirts can old women be seen herding goats. </p> <p>Just before Christmas, Stephen Byers, Britain's secretary of state for trade and industry, stated that he was \"minded\" to grant a \u00a3200-million export credit to the engineering company Balfour Beatty, which is part of the Swiss-based consortium that will build the Ilisu Dam. Both Byers and Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, seem originally to have had objections to the project - however, it is thought that they were overruled by Tony Blair. This is despite an independent report, commissioned by the department of trade and industry (DTI), that raised serious concerns about the impact of Ilisu on the local population - not least because of the experience of previous far-from-satisfactory dam-resettlement programmes in Turkey. The report itself became public only after a High Court case forced the government to comply with European law on the provision of environmental assessments. </p> <p>By all appearances, an ethical foreign policy has been abandoned in exchange for the chance to develop business connections with a country that has passed the first stage of prospective EU membership. The DTI has been described by one analyst as the most unreconstructed of Thatcherite departments, one still committed to allowing nothing to stand in the way of British business. The decision to grant the export credit to Balfour Beatty was originally rubber-stamped at a junior level a year ago; no ministers were consulted, and Cook was unaware of the plan, which rebounds on his own department's relations with Syria and Iraq. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth argues that energy- efficiency and solar-power projects would be more than capable of creating as much power as the dam. But no alternatives to dam- building have even been considered by the Turkish government, according to a second UK government-commissioned report, prepared by a company called Environmental Resources Management (ERM). </p> <p>Then there is the question of water. The River Tigris rises in Turkey and flows south-east for 1,900km, before merging with the Euphrates and eventually flowing into the Persian Gulf. For 30km, just before the river enters Iraq, it forms part of the Turkish-Syrian border. The land between the Iraqi sections of the Tigris and the Euphrates was once Mesopotamia, the site of one of the world's oldest civilisations. The damming of the Tigris will act as a giant tap on the water supply of both Iraq and Syria - a tap that might, at some time, be turned off and the water diverted. This at a time when climate changes are provoking droughts, has the potential to provoke water wars in the Middle East. ERM's report warns that, because of a lack of waste-water-treatment facilities in the major urban areas of the region, sewage flowing into the reservoir might poison the waters of the Tigris further downstream, at the very least posing a threat to freshwater fish. </p> <p>The Arab League wrote to Cook last May to express its concerns about project, pointing out that Turkey had not consulted Iraq over the building of the Ilisu Dam and was therefore in violation of the Treaty of Friendship and Neighbourly Relations, signed between the two countries in 1946. The dam also potentially breaches agreements drawn up between Turkey and Syria in 1986, on regulating the flow of the Euphrates. \"The Arab part of the Middle East suffers from a scarcity of water,\" says Ghayth Armanazi, head of the London mission of the Arab League. \"This could be a very explosive situation indeed. The question of water in the area is very important. It is a looming crisis in the future if the countries involved don't take account of the needs of others.\" </p> <p>From the point of view of the Turkish government, however, the Ilisu Dam is a bona fide scheme for dealing with its own economic problems, and for raising productivity in the country as a whole and in the impoverished south-east in particular. According to the DTI report, by combining Ilisu with a smaller irrigation dam downstream at Cizre, where the Tigris crosses into Syria, the potentially cultivable land rises from 7% to 53%. And no one denies the need for energy. Power cuts are frequent in Istanbul and a daily occurrence in the south. Batman is far more prosperous than Hasankeyf, thanks to the discovery of oil in the nearby hills - even so, an hour after our arrival there, the electricity went off for an hour and the oil refinery came to a standstill. The town has no less than 40 internet cafes, but people often have to wait for hours for the modems to connect. </p> <p>The DTI's report is laughably called Stakeholders' Attitudes To Involuntary Resettlement In The Context Of The Ilisu Dam Project, Turkey. You cannot imagine anyone further from stakeholders than the people of Hasankeyf and its surrounding villages. A civil war, government repression and well-documented human rights abuses, and a way of life that precludes proper representation of the peasantry by their feudal landlords do not make for a stakeholder economy. </p> <p>The DTI report itself admitted that \"there has not been any kind of consultation or communication between the DSI [the Turkish state water authority] and the affected people.\" On December 22, 1999, having known for two decades that there was likely to be a dam, the people of Hasankeyf had their first official visit to inform them that it was going to happen. \"The politicians came and the governor and professors came,\" says Gundogdu, the old boatman. \"They really want this dam to be built, but we said to them what we say to you today. We don't want it. We listened to them, but they didn't listen to us. They will do whatever they want. We don't want our stones to be drowned. We don't want the 165 mosques of the city to be beneath the water. We can't leave our ancestors.\" Another man caught us as we left the coffee shop. He says the problem was not about politics or economics, but about the destruction of Kurdish culture. </p> <p>Hasan Kilic, the deputy director of the water authority, is himself a Kurd. So passionate is he to explain why the dam should go ahead that he drives from Diyarbakir to track us down in our hotel in Batman. He speaks lyrically of the River Tigris: \"This water that flows, it is life, it is for the land, and the fertility of the land is very important for the future of the country. Energy is the most important factor for development in health, economy, education, everything,\" he continues. \"The region needs this energy desperately. We are obliged to meet the needs of our people.\" </p> <p>Everything in Batman is new: the Mazda dealership, the internet cafes, the government offices. Nothing in Hasankeyf is. I ask Kilic how he felt about the town's destruction. He says, \"We are very attached to our tradition and very respectful of our history. Of course, we are sad that it is going to go but, for the health of a body, it is not very important that hair is cut off. If it is such an important project for the prosperity of the people, it is our duty to find a way to do it. We even hope that GAP [the South East Anatolia dams project] will create a reverse immigration back to the countryside. We think we will pass from dry land to wetlands . . . If I had the least thought that the dam would be bad for the people, I wouldn't talk this way. I am from this region. Who would like to lose their history? No one. Who would like to go in a war to die? No one. But there are priorities. The people deserve a prosperous land.\" </p> <p>In Anatolia, there is little talk of environ-mental concerns, of birds or solar energy. No one mentions the potential for war with Syria and Iraq over Turkey's control of their water supply. There is little love lost between the Kurds and Iraq, a country that has waged hideous war against its Kurdish minority. The two issues that concern local people are the protection of Hasankeyf and the Kurdish heritage it represents, and - of crucial importance - the compensation that might be offered if the area is evacuated. </p> <p>The DTI's report confirms the view that women are more optimistic about the potential resettlement than the men. Their life is unspeakably hard and - shut up at home, prohibited from going to the public places - they see a different reality on television. They imagine that life will be easier in the cities. A 29-year-old woman, who didn't want to give her name, lives with her 60-year-old husband and their four children in one of the caves. She had grown up in the town, but had lived in the rocks since she married when she was 15. \"It was a shock,\" she says, \"and even now it is difficult. This cave is no good.\" Her stomach was infected and she had no money to buy medicine. A fifth child had died 18 months ago at the age of one year. </p> <p>I ask her what might happen when the dam comes. \"I have no idea,\" she replies. \"We don't have a house, so maybe we won't get any compensation. Nobody from the government has come and said what will happen. I have no idea whether the dam will make things better or not. I can't speak because I am a woman and it is not my domain.\" </p> <p>Hasankeyf, she says, is a \"clean\" place, meaning that the air is clean but also that there was little fighting and that no one had joined the watchmen, the local volunteer police who were armed by the government to wage war against the PKK. There is very strong local support for the PKK, and a refusal to recognise its brutality or its campaign of murders against fellow Kurds. </p> <p>The DTI report analyses the problems of resettlement in a region where land was transferred to tribal leaders in exchange for political support during Ottoman rule. Much of the land that is to be drowned is owned by absentee landlords who will receive large sums in compensation. These landlords have for years been planting certain trees, which they know from studying the water authority's previous compensation packages attract the highest price. The people who actually work the land have only grazing rights granted by oral tradition. Unless they can produce a piece of paper, a \"deed\", they will get nothing, and this is not a culture that has set much store on written agreements. </p> <p>In Hasankeyf, the fight is to save the ancient city and the people refuse to discuss resettlement. In the countryside, it is a different matter. In the village of Kesmekopru I, Huseyin Tarhan, an old man and head of his family, says, \"They are going to give us a house, but what will happen to the animals? How can we live in the city? What am I going to do so far away? The governor came and said we would get a house, but our only skills are farming. Everyone in the village has a different opinion. Some want to go to Batman, some want land, but we want our village kept together. We have water, vegetables, yoghurt, milk, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, a donkey and everything is free.\" </p> <p>Someone comes in with a bundle of twigs and puts them in the stove which has a flue pushing through the straw-lined roof. The house warms up at once. Afyer Tarhan, 20, nursing a snuffly baby, is married to one of Huseyin's sons who gets occasional work in Batman as a truck driver at $6 a day. She is watching television. I ask her if she wants the life she sees there. She says she doesn't, \"because at the end there is only death\". </p> <p>The Tarhan family have had a deed for their house for 40 or 50 years, but not one for the land. That is in Huseyin's brother's name, though they work the land together. If the dam is built, they will be offered money or a house. The DTI report says that those who have accepted money in previous resettlements have wildly over-estimated its value in the city and have spent it in a matter of months. The family is already in the process of disintegration. A son, 22-year-old Fevzi, is studying to be a teacher and, when he qualifies, will be assigned a job by the government. He has no idea where he will be sent. Like all the young men, he has worked in the tourist resorts. I ask why the family didn't move to the coast. The answer is that the wages (around $300 a month) are not enough to support a family because of the high cost of living. By practising subsistence farming and using the tourist money brought back by absentee sons to buy consumer goods or to keep in reserve for medicine, a village family can survive. In the city, the old people who here have a function, feeding chickens, baking bread, will lose their purpose and become a drain on the younger generation. </p> <p>One night, after the police thought we had gone to bed, someone brought to the hotel in Batman six men who had been displaced by a previous dam development. The first to arrive looked as if he was a businessman in a suit, tie, raincoat and expensive-looking watch. But, like a credit-card debtor, his wealth was all in his appearance. His name was Suleyman Yaman and he came from the village of Kozluk Kaletepe, which was requisitioned by the government for the Batman dam in 1992. \"I had land where I planted tobacco,\" he says, \"and now the land is under the water and I am doing absolutely nothing. What I would protest is that when we were leaving our villages they gave us compensation as if we were beggars. </p> <p>\"To this day, lots of parliamentarians have promised they would give us money, but even the pittance we received came month by month, so it was devalued by inflation. We keep waiting for them to give us the money, we get loans from other places, and then they don't pay us. We take the money they give us and begin court cases against the state to get the compensation they owe us, so the money gets spent on the court case.\" Hasan Sonuk, from Gitlicevre (the Kurdish name for Gunduk) says: \"We are just like the earthquake survivors. They emptied the village in 1994. In fact, they burnt it out because of security reasons.\" (The government has requisitioned villages in dam-development areas where they think there is PKK activity and destroyed the houses or the land. The people who lived there got no compensation.) </p> <p>\"This is the truth,\" Sonuk says. \"I haven't moved one step forward since I first heard in 1989 that they wanted my land. I have been dealing with the court cases over compensation. If I had been reimbursed right away, I would have had enough money to build a hotel in Ankara. I waited outside the governor's office for days, and then I received a paper with no name on it which said that they wouldn't pay the money because it would only be spent on terrorism, anyway.\" Round the table they tell their stories: the grandfather of one man had worked the land, but when he showed the government his deed, he was told that it wasn't valid. Another was given 625,000 Turkish lire in 1990: today, because of inflation, it is worth just over a dollar.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,138271,00.html\">Before the deluge part II</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Izzethin Gundogdu was once a boatman who transported goods and passengers in his animal-hide craft along the River Tigris in the far south-eastern corner of Turkey. Years ago, when he was a young man, he passed through a village where he saw some men lowering ropes into the waters. He asked them what they were doing. One day, they told him, a dam would be built there. He did not believe it. \"Not then, not now,\" he says. But - whatever Gundogdu, or indeed anyone else living in the area may think - the dam is likely to be a reality by the end of the decade: 25,000 people will be forced off their land and out of their homes, and the ancient Kurdish town of Hasankeyf will drown beneath the waters of a vast 300-square-kilometre lake flooding the Tigris valley. And all thanks to the British government, which is \"minded\" to provide financial guarantees worth \u00a3200 million. Turkey is desperate for energy. The proposed Ilisu Dam a few kilometres downstream from Hasankeyf is the final stage of a project first conceived in the 50s to create hydroelectricity from a series of dams on the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. From the Kurdish point of view, it is the equivalent of the EU planning to flood an area that includes Stonehenge on the grounds that it would benefit the energy needs of western Europe. \"This is where we were born and where we grew up,\" says Gundogdu, sitting drinking glasses of tea with the other old men of the town. \"There is no difference between young and old. We don't want this dam!\" In a back-street grocery shop - a little room selling wool, buttons, oil, biscuits, margarine - a 66-year-old woman says to me, \"My name is Makbule Kocaman. Write it down big. And write down big that the dam is sin, that we don't want any dam, that we don't want to live after Hasankeyf. It is the flower of all the world.\" Hasankeyf, with a population of 5,500, lies in southern Anatolia, near the Iraqi and Syrian borders. From the early 90s until very recently, the area has been under a state of emergency because of the war between the Turkish government and the PKK, the Kurdish separatist organisation founded by Abdullah Ocalan in 1978. Few people have been to Hasankeyf, and probably no one from the current British government or its recent predecessors. It is a blighted place. It is one of the few towns in Turkey without a bank. For 20 years, Hasankeyf has had no inward investment because everyone knew that the dam was coming and that the town would be destroyed. Despite the ceasefire that began last summer after Ocalan's capture, the region remains classified as medium-risk.

The two issues that concern local people are the protection of Hasankeyf and the Kurdish heritage it represents, and - of crucial importance - the compensation that might be offered if the area is evacuated. The DTI's report confirms the view that women are more optimistic about the potential resettlement than the men. Their life is unspeakably hard and - shut up at home, prohibited from going to the public places - they see a different reality on television. They imagine that life will be easier in the cities. A 29-year-old woman, who didn't want to give her name, lives with her 60-year-old husband and their four children in one of the caves. She had grown up in the town, but had lived in the rocks since she married when she was 15. \"It was a shock,\" she says, \"and even now it is difficult. This cave is no good.\" Her stomach was infected and she had no money to buy medicine. A fifth child had died 18 months ago at the age of one year. I ask her what might happen when the dam comes. \"I have no idea,\" she replies. \"We don't have a house, so maybe we won't get any compensation. Nobody from the government has come and said what will happen. I have no idea whether the dam will make things better or not. I can't speak because I am a woman and it is not my domain.\" Hasankeyf, she says, is a \"clean\" place, meaning that the air is clean but also that there was little fighting and that no one had joined the watchmen, the local volunteer police who were armed by the government to wage war against the PKK. There is very strong local support for the PKK, and a refusal to recognise its brutality or its campaign of murders against fellow Kurds. The DTI report analyses the problems of resettlement in a region where land was transferred to tribal leaders in exchange for political support during Ottoman rule. Much of the land that is to be drowned is owned by absentee landlords who will receive large sums in compensation. These landlords have for years been planting certain trees, which they know from studying the water authority's previous compensation packages attract the highest price. The people who actually work the land have only grazing rights granted by oral tradition. Unless they can produce a piece of paper, a \"deed\", they will get nothing, and this is not a culture that has set much store on written agreements. In Hasankeyf, the fight is to save the ancient city and the people refuse to discuss resettlement. In the countryside, it is a different matter. In the village of Kesmekopru I, Huseyin Tarhan, an old man and head of his family, says, \"They are going to give us a house, but what will happen to the animals? How can we live in the city? What am I going to do so far away? The governor came and said we would get a house, but our only skills are farming. Everyone in the village has a different opinion. Some want to go to Batman, some want land, but we want our village kept together. We have water, vegetables, yoghurt, milk, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, a donkey and everything is free.\" Someone comes in with a bundle of twigs and puts them in the stove which has a flue pushing through the straw-lined roof. The house warms up at once. Afyer Tarhan, 20, nursing a snuffly baby, is married to one of Huseyin's sons who gets occasional work in Batman as a truck driver at $6 a day. She is watching television. I ask her if she wants the life she sees there. She says she doesn't, \"because at the end there is only death\". The Tarhan family have had a deed for their house for 40 or 50 years, but not one for the land. That is in Huseyin's brother's name, though they work the land together. If the dam is built, they will be offered money or a house. The DTI report says that those who have accepted money in previous resettlements have wildly over-estimated its value in the city and have spent it in a matter of months. The family is already in the process of disintegration. A son, 22-year-old Fevzi, is studying to be a teacher and, when he qualifies, will be assigned a job by the government. He has no idea where he will be sent. Like all the young men, he has worked in the tourist resorts. I ask why the family didn't move to the coast. The answer is that the wages (around $300 a month) are not enough to support a family because of the high cost of living. By practising subsistence farming and using the tourist money brought back by absentee sons to buy consumer goods or to keep in reserve for medicine, a village family can survive. In the city, the old people who here have a function, feeding chickens, baking bread, will lose their purpose and become a drain on the younger generation. One night, after the police thought we had gone to bed, someone brought to the hotel in Batman six men who had been displaced by a previous dam development. The first to arrive looked as if he was a businessman in a suit, tie, raincoat and expensive-looking watch. But, like a credit-card debtor, his wealth was all in his appearance. His name was Suleyman Yaman and he came from the village of Kozluk Kaletepe, which was requisitioned by the government for the Batman dam in 1992. \"I had land where I planted tobacco,\" he says, \"and now the land is under the water and I am doing absolutely nothing. What I would protest is that when we were leaving our villages they gave us compensation as if we were beggars. \"To this day, lots of parliamentarians have promised they would give us money, but even the pittance we received came month by month, so it was devalued by inflation. We keep waiting for them to give us the money, we get loans from other places, and then they don't pay us. We take the money they give us and begin court cases against the state to get the compensation they owe us, so the money gets spent on the court case.\" Hasan Sonuk, from Gitlicevre (the Kurdish name for Gunduk) says: \"We are just like the earthquake survivors. They emptied the village in 1994. In fact, they burnt it out because of security reasons.\" (The government has requisitioned villages in dam-development areas where they think there is PKK activity and destroyed the houses or the land. The people who lived there got no compensation.) \"This is the truth,\" Sonuk says. \"I haven't moved one step forward since I first heard in 1989 that they wanted my land. I have been dealing with the court cases over compensation. If I had been reimbursed right away, I would have had enough money to build a hotel in Ankara. I waited outside the governor's office for days, and then I received a paper with no name on it which said that they wouldn't pay the money because it would only be spent on terrorism, anyway.\" Round the table they tell their stories: the grandfather of one man had worked the land, but when he showed the government his deed, he was told that it wasn't valid. Another was given 625,000 Turkish lire in 1990: today, because of inflation, it is worth just over a dollar. Before the deluge part II",

Now, I don't have any of these - I have debts. We were landowners then, and we didn't have any such worries. We lost, but all of those who still have their lands have wetlands now. They have better agriculture - those who have finally got water, it's very good for them.\" </p> <p>I asked the interpreter, a TV journalist, what was said about the Ilisu Dam in Istanbul. Very little, she replied. There was a kind of taboo on talking about the Kurdish regions. </p> <p>Among those Turks who live in southern Anatolia, any concern that exists about the dam project centres on Hasankeyf itself and its archaeological treasures. The town is sometimes compared to Ephesus, the ancient Greek city that is one of the country's main tourist attractions. The deputy governor of the Batman region, Musa Kulaklikaya, has a Save Hasankeyf poster on the wall of his office. \"We can't say it's sure that the Ilisu Dam will be constructed, because of the credits situation,\" he says. \"We hear that there are countries cancelling their credit promises, and I think this has to do with the worry about protecting the archaeological sites. We don't want to give up the dam, nor do we want to give up the historical sites. Our responsibility as the governor's office is that, if the dam is constructed, we have to deal with the resettlement problems. </p> <p>\"The fact that it is a historic area, which means that they don't have permission to construct any new buildings, and the uncertainty about the dam makes the area under-developed,\" he continues. \"Because of these problems, the historic sites are used and abused by the people. They don't even realise the value of the historic sites they are living next to. If the dam is constructed, the people will be moved to a new area constructed by the central government.\" I ask him if the new town that was envisioned by the government included any planning for jobs. \"The central government doesn't have a plan for that,\" he replies, \"and neither does the local government, but the people won't be in a situation that is much worse than the one they are in now.\" Would the construction of the dam create work for local people? \"The companies who will build the dam have the free will to do whatever they want, but the fact that the workforce is much cheaper here is a good opportunity.\" Will you be sad if the dam is built and Hasankeyf is destroyed? \"Of course,\" he says. \"Is it a beautiful city? It was, but the people have been vandalising it, using the stones in their gardens.\" </p> <p>Murat Cano, an Istanbul-based lawyer who is preparing a case to go to the European Court to save Hasankeyf, believes that the failure to recognise the city's importance is a product partly of the Ottoman Empire: anything that was non-Muslim was regarded as the work of the infidel, which is why artefacts from the pre-Islamic era could be taken away to foreign museums. Another reason for the neglect of Hasankeyf, he argues, is that for the first 50 years of the republic the emphasis of the state was on modernisation, and it is only in the past quarter century that a consciousness of the cultural heritage has developed. </p> <p>There are three possible solutions for saving Hasankeyf, none of which is currently being considered by the Turkish government. One envisages three small dams connected to one another. The second involves bringing water from Lake Van, to the north-east of the town, and from a few branches of the Tigris. The third scheme, and the one most people discuss, is to lower the wall of the dam from 570m to 520m. \"This,\" says Cano, \"will save Hasankeyf.\" If Hasankeyf does survive, what might its future be? The local population is unanimous: tourism. With the PKK ceasefire, the easing of the state of emergency regulations and pressure on the government to invest, the residents are confident that the town could rival Ephesus. </p> <p>Mehmet Tarhan has owned a restaurant on the road to Mardin since 1979, and recalls that, until the PKK war, tourists used to come. \"Now, no one comes,\" he says. \"For the eclipse, they didn't even come.\" Seeing no future in Hasankeyf, Tarhan took himself, his wife and his eight children to Istanbul, where he got a job as a waiter. After only 18 months, he returned and re-opened his restaurant. \"It's very difficult in Istanbul,\" he says. \"The children didn't like it, either. We couldn't find a house for all of us. We are very happy that we are back here. We are against Hasankeyf being drowned, but we want the dam. One day, Hasankeyf can become the prime attraction of Turkey. It can create a lot of job opportunities. </p> <p>\"If they drown Hasankeyf, whatever they give us won't be enough. In the middle of the desert they will build public housing, but we won't have land, we won't have work. If that happens, I will go back to live in the cave at the top of the castle, which the waters won't cover. I'm from there, I can go back.\" He smiles. \"The dam's life is short, only 60 years. Hasankeyf has been a capital under three different civilisations.\" </p> <p>The mayor of Hasankeyf, Vahap Kusen, says, \"My message to Tony Blair is this: I hope he will not make decisions that will be condemned by history.\" </p> <p>What, then, is the case against the dam? On the one hand, I am not convinced by the arguments that the Ilisu Dam amounts to ethnic cleansing, as alleged by Friends of the Earth. The mayor of Batman, Abdullah Akin, who is a member of Hadep, the constitutional face of Kurdish political ambitions, says, \"Is this dam being built to destroy Hasankeyf? No. But there is an attitude of paying no attention to Kurdish culture.\" An observer who is a member of one of Turkey's other ethnic minorities told me that, in her view, if the dam destroyed Kurdish culture, that would be regarded by the government as a bonus, but it was not its main purpose. </p> <p>There is no doubt that that the impoverished farmers of south-east Anatolia are desperate for an improvement in their standard of living. Environmental activists, however, argue that large dam projects such as this are mid-20th century solutions now outdated. Dams usually silt up before their expected lifespan is complete. In Turkey, inefficient systems for the transmission of energy mean that 30% of that energy is wasted. For the same amount of money, the government could build solar-energy plants backed up by a number of small dams. But this would not benefit the officials, the big landowners and the construction companies such as Balfour Beatty, which, whatever the dam's effectiveness, will always be the biggest winners in the planning and building of mega projects. </p> <p>If the export credit is granted to Balfour Beatty, the British government will forfeit its claim to an ethical foreign policy; that is, one that places human rights above our own economic interests. The export credits guarantee department is essentially an aid organisation for big business that underwrites the financial risk of companies trading with countries where there is a possibility of default on payment. Balfour Beatty, which is applying for \u00a3200 million-worth of credit, in this country built the Cardiff Bay barrage and was also behind the Fairmile road extension that Swampy dug beneath. As taxpayers, we are going to insure the profits of this company against losses in a programme that cannot produce adequate protection of the interests of those most affected. In a press release issued on December 21, 1999, trade secretary Stephen Byers suggested that he would grant the credit on fulfilment of certain conditions, including the need to \"draw up a resettlement programme which reflects internationally accepted practice and includes independent monitoring\" and to \"produce a detailed plan to preserve as much of the archaeological heritage of Hasankeyf as possible\". This has been interpreted by archaeologists in Turkey as removing things to museums. </p> <p>I asked DTI spokesman Mike Snowdon to \"sell\" the dam to me. I expected an enthusiastic account of how the granting of the export credit would create British jobs. Instead, all he could manage was that the decision would bring \"help and aid to a friendly nation to diversify their energy provision\". He had no idea how many British jobs Balfour Beatty might create. When I rang Balfour Beatty, Tim Sharp, its director of corporate communications, told me that it was \"too early to say\". He conceded that, \"in previous instances, the Turkish government's resettlement performance has not been brilliant\". Back at the DTI, Snowdon said that no decision had yet been taken, and that nothing would happen before a further environmental report being prepared by the Swiss consortium was published in the spring. I rang the foreign office to ask how the granting of an export credit to Balfour Beatty fitted in with the government's self-proclaimed ethical foreign policy. They did not return my calls. </p> <p>There are two ways of interpreting the government's conditions. On the one hand, they might be a means of imposing restrictions that Turkey is in no position to meet, thus creating a get-out clause. It is believed that, if Britain refuses to grant the credit, no other country will and that the project will then be dead. On the other hand, the conditions on resettlement will become operative only after the dam is under construction and the credit is granted. Then Britain will be able to say that it is Turkey's fault, not ours, if the conditions are unfulfilled.</p> <p>To undertake a properly structured, humane resettlement programme will take a massive readjustment in the way that the Turkish state regards its citizens, particularly those who live in the Kurdish regions. \"Ankara is represented in Anatolia,\" says newspaper editor Arif Aslan, \"but Anatolia is not represented in Ankara.\" Is Turkey is to move any further along the path to full membership of the EU, many aspects of the society must change, but if the dam is built before that, it will have created 60 years at most of useable energy, potentially fuelled a new Middle East war, swollen the slums of its cities with unemployable families, drowned its heritage and created a grievance among the Kurdish people that will recerberate long after Abdullah Ocalan is forgotten.

Indeed, the debate about religious broadcasting that has been prompted by my report - condemning one television series last year as \"trite\" and winning the backing of almost half of the Synod - is actually intended to strengthen your arm. <p>However, a year ago I had a hunch that all was far from well. When I analysed BBC statistics I was amazed: in 10 years the total output of BBC1 and BBC2 had increased by half - yet hours devoted to religious topics had declined by one-third. In the last year for which figures are available, network radio religious hours fell by more than 15%.</p> <p>Another concern was the marginalisation of such programmes to times when relatively few watch or listen. The Radio 4 changes of April 1998 hit the Sunday programme particularly hard. </p> <p>Meanwhile, on television, Songs of Praise has been moved ever earlier and evening programmes have been reduced from 48 to 26 weeks a year. When the latter did appear they were seen ever later, on occasion at 11.45pm. I was pleased to note this month that Everyman began at 10.40pm. This, surely, is evidence that publicity can help persuade commissioners and schedulers to give your producers' programmes the prominence they really deserve.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Nigel Holmes<br> Radio producer and General Synod member</p> <p><b>Dear Nigel,</b><br> Thanks for your kind words about the BBC's record in religious broadcasting. This debate is one that has been going on for over 70 years within the BBC, as the corporation works to keep its portfolio in step with the changing needs of society as a whole. And it's one that the BBC has shared with the institutions of all religions - most recently as host of a symposium in October at which you spoke. </p> <p>The sword of statistics shouldn't always be equated with the sword of truth, but I can't resist pointing out that the BBC broadcasts over 4,000 hours of religious programmes a year, over 550 hours of which are on national radio and television, while the remainder are tailored to the needs of local communities. Radio 4 broadcasts both Sunday and Sunday Worship in peak radio time, not at the margins of the schedule. Both programmes are thriving in their new slots - Sunday Worship gets a bigger audience than Desert Island Discs, and is beaten only by Broadcasting House and The Archers. Its earlier timing also allows many churchgoers to listen for the first time. </p> <p>While the figures on BBC1 and 2 have indeed declined, a large part of the decline results from ending a repeat of Songs of Praise. Songs of Praise continues to kick-start Sunday evenings, and follows the early-evening news; hardly a marginal place in the schedule. And coming up on BBC1 are some exciting new religious programmes, including Son of God (a biography of Jesus) and Soul of Britain (a spiritual audit of Great Britain). We could go on debating details, but I assume there are more fundamental issues you want to raise.</p> <p>Yours ever, <br> Ernie Rea<br> Head of Religious Broadcasting, BBC</p> <p><b>Dear Ernie,</b><br> As Maggie Brown, the Guardian's media correspondent, put it last year: \"The key point is that the great questions about life and death and the forces of good, evil, charity and faith never change. They are intrinsically interesting. They deserve greater attention.\"</p> <p>You claim the Sunday programme is \"not at the margins of the schedule\" - yet you've previously admitted in writing that you \"would like to see it moved to a later, more accessible slot\". On television two new series will not compensate for the losses which space does not permit me to list. Your 3,500 hours, I should point out, is a little less than two hours a week on each English local radio station and the small national stations.</p> <p>They have not been immune to cuts. This very week, a campaign has been launched by the Archbishop of Wales to oppose a severe reduction in staff in the religious department at BBC Wales. What worries me is that the BBC seems to fly in the face of its own audience research, which in 1995 found that over 80% \"want at least the present level of religious programmes\". Yet since then hours on BBC1 and BBC2 have fallen by 20% and network radio by 15%. And The Heaven and Earth Show has been strongly criticised in the church press for shying away from religious and moral issues - yet the series accounts for about a third of your television output. The Sunday Morning programme on ITV is far more substantial, and later in the day ITV provides a serious religious series for young people entitled What's It All About? Surely this is the question that religious broadcasting should be asking?</p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br> Nigel</p> <p><b>Dear Nigel,</b><br> The BBC is convinced that those issues you refer to - life and death, good, evil, charity and faith - are indeed of interest to all, whether religious or not. It is for that very reason that we have been trying to bring them to the attention of a broader and younger audience.</p> <p>The Heaven and Earth Show, far from \"shying away\" from issues, deals with that subject matter in a way that is appropriate for a Sunday morning audience, many of whom never darken the door of a church. It may not be to your taste, but the BBC's religious programmes reflect the diversity of faith in Britain today: Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Jews and Buddhists make regular appearances alongside Christians, as do those searching for a faith. The evidence suggests that the general audience appreciates the variety. We believe that religious broadcasting can be of compelling interest, and that is why we want to bring it to the widest possible audience - of believers and non-believers alike.</p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br> Ernie</p> <p><b>Dear Ernie,</b><br> You don't appear to contest the statistics which prompted me to raise the issue, nor do you address the hurt which is so much in evidence at BBC Wales. In your own strategy paper, you describe your staff in the network department as being \"demoralised and battered\".</p> <p>As we exchange letters there are fresh developments. This week the person longest and most publicly associated with BBC religious television, Joan Bakewell, has announced her departure. She is reported as saying that the BBC has neglected its religious programmes and points to late-night transmission times and unending cuts.</p> <p>Those cuts are said to be funding digital television services, BBC Choice and Knowledge, which as far as one can tell from the Radio Times, are devoid of religious content, even during festivals.</p> <p>You raise the other faith dimension. My impression at that symposium in October was that all faith communities are dissatisfied with the BBC. Some told me that they were amazed at how much had been lost, with barely a whimper from Christian churches. They want a larger cake so that in turn their portion will be bigger. But we should not forget that all the non-Christian active faith adherents amount to less than 5% of the population of the UK.</p> <p>As you will be aware, unease between the BBC and all faiths has been growing, yet it seems not to have been possible to persuade the governors to take the concerns of these millions of licence-payers seriously.

      "bodyText": "Premiership new boys Sunderland FC yesterday spelled out the cost of joining football's top flight - and revealed plans to turn the club's Stadium of Light into one of the country's biggest sports venues with a capacity which could rise to 66,000. \"Survival and success in the premier league is expensive\" said club chairman Bryan Sanderson, as he revealed a 54% increase in players' wages on the levels paid out last year, when the club was in division one. In the six months ending November 30, their wages had soared from \u00a33.1m to \u00a34.7m as the squad was strengthened and star players demanded big pay rises in return for agreeing contract extentions. But the fat salaries being paid out to players such as Steve Bould, Stefan Schwarz and England striker Kevin Phillips are paying dividends. The club is lying sixth in the premiership and may qualify for lucrative European competitions next year. Sunderland has stayed in profit in the premiership, despite extra expenses. Yesterday the club reported profits before accounting for player transfers up 9% to \u00a31.6m in its first half on turnover up 45% to \u00a314.3m. The club made \u00a33m on player trading after banking a \u00a35.5m profit from selling Michael Bridges to Leeds and Lee Clark to Fulham. Two live games on BSkyB helped push media income up 65% from \u00a31.7m to \u00a32.9m, while retail and merchandis ing turnover climbed more than a fifth, to \u00a31.6m. Gate receipts were up 22% to \u00a35.4m as league attendance rose 8% to an average crowd of more than 41,000 per home game. Former chairman Bob Murray, who remains a director of the club and 37% shareholder, yesterday said the club could boost its capacity to 66,000 if England succeeded in its bid to stage the 2006 World Cup. Capacity at the Stadium of Light ground is already being increased from 42,500 to 48,500, and the club is seeking planning permission for further expansion to 55,000. Mr Murray said the club would then like to go to 66,500 -which would rival Old Trafford - but that it would need the World Cup to justify that final phase and government help with the funding.

We publish the producers' guidelines firstly so that audiences can read and understand the editorial standards that we aspire to, and secondly so that they can judge our performance accordingly.\"",

      "body": "<p>Food is something most of us are pretty fussy about on holiday - either because we want to indulge ourselves and eat well or because we don't want to get ill. But certain places are considered \"safe\", including, undoubtedly, the US. </p> <p>The biggest worry most tourists are likely to have is severe weight gain, such is the size and calorific value of the portions. But one potentially serious health issue that many Britons have followed closely at home is probably not given a second thought when they go on holiday - genetically-modified food. </p> <p>Only three years after the first large-scale commercial harvest, GM crops now cover a quarter of US cropland - around 90 million acres - and are fully integrated into the American diet. </p> <p>But only about a third of Americans are aware that GM foods are being sold. \"There's a kind of schizophrenia here,\" says Charles Margulis, GM campaigner at Greenpeace. \"On the one hand, we are extremely health conscious, but on the other we have very high sugar, high fat, high red meat diets. The GM issue is just another contradiction.\" </p> <p>There are four main genetically-modified crops in the US - corn, soya, rape seed and cotton seed - and 60-70% of processed food in the US is likely to contain GM ingredients. </p> <p>The multinationals that control the biotechnology insist they cannot separate GM crops from non-GM crops at source and are fighting the call for labelling. </p> <p>A holiday-maker will find it practically impossible to eat or drink without consuming something that is genetically modified. </p> <p>\"Some potatoes are also GM so avoid fast-food french fries,\" says Margulis. \"And a small percentage of tomatoes are GM, so processed tomato-based foods like ketchup may also be contaminated. </p> <p>\"Corn syrup is ubiquitous in virtually any sweetened drink,\" he explains, \"so Coke and other sodas are likely to be made with a combination of non-GM and GM corn syrup.\" </p> <p>Is the answer for the anti-GM tourist to avoid the US as a holiday destination? Sadly the influence of the US biotechnology companies growing GM crops goes much further than the US. Their crops are exported to Europe for animal feed and ironically, the more the US and European public protests about the issue, the more likely it is that GM crops will be dumped on poorer countries, as happened last September when Russia received illegal shipments of Novartis GM maize from the US. </p> <p>\"Exotic\" environments - so vital for tourism - could also be threatened. Scientists are currently assessing the potentially harmful effect on Mexico's biodiversity of the recent arrival of 5 million tons of US maize - up to 35% genetically modified. A Cornell University study showed that 44% of the larvae of the monarch butterfly fed with milkweed contaminated with GM Bt-maize pollen died within 48 hours. </p> <p>\"The fall migration of monarch butterflies from Canada to central Mexican forests is a natural wonder,\" Dr Jane Rissler, senior staff scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, points out. \"The loss of monarchs - and perhaps many other incredible species around the world - is too high a price to pay for engineered corn.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.consumersunion.org\">Consumers Union website</a> has a comprehensive list of everyday GM products sold in the US. <a href=\"http://www.truefood.com\">The True Food Campaign</a> can be contacted at 0171-865 8100.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Food is something most of us are pretty fussy about on holiday - either because we want to indulge ourselves and eat well or because we don't want to get ill. But certain places are considered \"safe\", including, undoubtedly, the US. The biggest worry most tourists are likely to have is severe weight gain, such is the size and calorific value of the portions. But one potentially serious health issue that many Britons have followed closely at home is probably not given a second thought when they go on holiday - genetically-modified food. Only three years after the first large-scale commercial harvest, GM crops now cover a quarter of US cropland - around 90 million acres - and are fully integrated into the American diet. But only about a third of Americans are aware that GM foods are being sold. \"There's a kind of schizophrenia here,\" says Charles Margulis, GM campaigner at Greenpeace. \"On the one hand, we are extremely health conscious, but on the other we have very high sugar, high fat, high red meat diets. The GM issue is just another contradiction.\" There are four main genetically-modified crops in the US - corn, soya, rape seed and cotton seed - and 60-70% of processed food in the US is likely to contain GM ingredients. The multinationals that control the biotechnology insist they cannot separate GM crops from non-GM crops at source and are fighting the call for labelling. A holiday-maker will find it practically impossible to eat or drink without consuming something that is genetically modified. \"Some potatoes are also GM so avoid fast-food french fries,\" says Margulis. \"And a small percentage of tomatoes are GM, so processed tomato-based foods like ketchup may also be contaminated. \"Corn syrup is ubiquitous in virtually any sweetened drink,\" he explains, \"so Coke and other sodas are likely to be made with a combination of non-GM and GM corn syrup.\" Is the answer for the anti-GM tourist to avoid the US as a holiday destination? Sadly the influence of the US biotechnology companies growing GM crops goes much further than the US. Their crops are exported to Europe for animal feed and ironically, the more the US and European public protests about the issue, the more likely it is that GM crops will be dumped on poorer countries, as happened last September when Russia received illegal shipments of Novartis GM maize from the US. \"Exotic\" environments - so vital for tourism - could also be threatened. Scientists are currently assessing the potentially harmful effect on Mexico's biodiversity of the recent arrival of 5 million tons of US maize - up to 35% genetically modified. A Cornell University study showed that 44% of the larvae of the monarch butterfly fed with milkweed contaminated with GM Bt-maize pollen died within 48 hours. \"The fall migration of monarch butterflies from Canada to central Mexican forests is a natural wonder,\" Dr Jane Rissler, senior staff scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, points out. \"The loss of monarchs - and perhaps many other incredible species around the world - is too high a price to pay for engineered corn.\" The Consumers Union website has a comprehensive list of everyday GM products sold in the US. The True Food Campaign can be contacted at 0171-865 8100.",

What does is shot beyond repair: a few paintings and sketches, including a sulky-looking self-portrait; scattered appearances in pre-Victorian gentlemen's magazines; a late-period ticket-of-leave appeal from his convict's lodgement in Van Diemen's Land.</p> <p>Essentially he seems to have been a minor Romantic hanger-on, one of many small fry sizzling in the wake of mighty acquaintances. He painted Byron (a carefully romanticised version of an earlier portrait by Thomas Phillips) and knew Keats, Lamb and Hazlitt, as well as attracting the notice of a longer-lived generation of Victorian writers such as Thackeray's friend Bryan Proctor, who were able to give some account of him to a fascinated mid-century public. </p> <p>Inevitably, given the rumours that gave Wainewright's reputation its gothic sheen, the artistic achievements were a sideshow to the main event. Later Victorians remembered him for a series of unexplained and sinister deaths, which coloured his memory to the exclusion of anything much else: the passing of his uncle in 1828 (which enabled the nephew to inherit a commodious property at Chiswick), the mysterious demise of his mother-in-law a year later, and finally a devious scam involving the death of his wife's half-sister a few days after the framing of a fistful of life insurance policies. </p> <p>Eventually brought to trial in 1837 after a rash visit home from his French hiding place, Wainewright was arraigned on forgery charges, but no one - either during his transportation on the convict hulk or after his death 10 years later - was in any doubt of the greater guilt.</p> <p>Subsequently he became a byword for Victorian notions of Romantic excess. Bulwer Lytton dramatised his career in Lucretia (benefiting from the input of an insurance company official); Dickens wrote a sensational serial, \"The Hunted Man\". The seal was set on Wainewright's peculiar position in the end-of-century art/morality standoff by Oscar Wilde's remark that \"The fact of a man being a Poisoner is nothing against his prose\" - which is true, perhaps, if not as startling as Wilde or indeed Motion appears to think it is. </p> <p>No difficulty, then, in marking down Wainewright's attraction to his latest biographer. There is the irresistibly seductive vision of the Romantic extremist, plunging Byronically through a world of strychnine and high aesthetics; there are the tantalising byways populated by all manner of contemporary curios such as the artists Henry Fuseli and Theodore von Holst, the latter responsible for some highly graphic erotica. And above all there is the beguiling sense of a blank canvas - writing a life of which so little is known that a satisfyingly large amount can be inferred gives the biographer an importance which is not allowed him in those lives already commemorated by a dozen fat volumes of letters. </p> <p>This is Motion's lure and his justification, but it is also his dilemma, and one which, despite all manner of graceful flourishes and a huge amount of lightly worn learning, I don't think he comes anywhere near to solving. Wainewright The Poisoner is described as an \"experimental biography\". Normally this kind of signposting awakens the direst forebodings. After all, the \"experimental novel\" tag is practically a guarantee of unreadability, and I have never studied anything calling itself an experimental poem without wanting to read the poet a lecture on scansion. </p> <p>Motion's experiment, it turns out, is to use the very limited materials available as the bones of an extended confession, courtesy of his subject, with the footnotes appended to each chapter acting as a kind of brake: confirming some things, denying others and at their best providing a dialogue between fake-Wainewright and biographer (or - to be perfectly blunt about it - a dialogue between Motion and himself). </p> <p>Considering this particular line of biographical attack, I should immediately declare an interest. In the course of writing Thackeray I soon identified three or four areas of Thackeray's life that I felt were crucial but where practically no information remained.</p> <p>One of the most obvious was Thackeray's relationship with his wife Isabella in the years after her madness, a period when she was placed in the care of a well-disposed keeper named Mrs Bakewell. Uneasily conscious that a biographer ought to say something about the undocumented spectacle of the novelist visiting his wife in the sequestered house in Camberwell, but knowing that only fragmentary evidence existed for what was said, I ended up inventing a two- or three-paragraph \"Bakewell Report\" in which Isabella's chatelaine reflects on her employer's visits. At the time this seemed to me a legitimate device (several reviewers thought otherwise). But applied to a 300-page biography, especially of such an elusive and protean fish as Wainewright, it creates more problems than it solves. </p> <p>The most obvious drawback, perhaps, is that the Wainewright voice, however carefully invested with authenticating references, is simply not interesting enough: goodish pastiche for a chapter or three, maybe, but, when enumerating the ranks of his arty acquaintance, not much more than a gazetteer. Throughout the book one looks for the sense of what might be called a personal myth - something that could raise Wainewright out of his world and turn him into a Romantic avenging angel rather than the also-ran we know him to have been. Somehow this never happens, and all that remains is the sense of an unreliable, disingenuous figure complaining that life has conspired against him. </p> <p>From the reader's point of view, too, the whole thing is impossibly weighed down with imputation. With the criminal elements trailed in advance, we know what to expect, and consequently can only regard the artistic fragments (most of the paintings and drawings were dispersed after his death) as a preliminary to the real meat of Wainewright's life. </p> <p>Which, of course, is Motion's point: the portrait of Byron and the strychnine in the soup are two sides of the same coin. And yet the Romantic extremist line never really convinces. A murderer may produce a work of art, but at the very least the knowledge that he has murdered is likely to colour and obscure any real appreciation of that art; Motion provides insufficient evidence that Wainewright had any great talent. </p> <p>Though Wainewright The Poisoner is neatly done and crammed with beguiling detail, to read these accounts of seedy continental exile and the indignities of his final years in Tasmania (Wainewright had expected a light sentence in return for admitting to two minor fraud charges, but was grievously disappointed) is to hear a constant undertow of ghost voices, a sense of what the material would have made as a novel by Peter Ackroyd or A S Byatt rather than an \"experimental biography\" by the poet laureate.</p> <p>This is not an insult: Motion's earlier The Lamberts and Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life are conspicuously well realised attempts on real lives.

To round the subject off, I'll take a look at renewable shrubs that have little or no individuality in shape, but that need regular pruning so as to gain maximum value from their flowers or foliage. </p> <p>These are the sort of shrubs that, having inherited them from a previous owner into whose property you have recently moved, you look at rather hopelessly, wondering what on earth to do and where to start. Once you have them under control, or if you started them from scratch yourself, the procedures are simple. You want to remove the old and tired wood, and leave or encourage the production of new. </p> <p>When? If the shrub flowered in spring, prune it immediately afterwards. Always make sure it is well fed, so that it feels like responding to your treatment. A shrub that feels unable to make new wood is a hopeless case. A spring pruning is followed by months of growing weather, during which your shrub can make good its losses with young growth. Your pruning is containing the overall size of the shrub, which saves on space uselessly filled. </p> <p>If the shrub flowers from summer on, there may be quite a bit of latitude over when to prune it. I dislike pruning a shrub that is a mass of foliage. It is difficult to get a clear picture of what you are doing. Also, in the presence of a lot of tender young shoots that you'll be wanting to encourage and leave, it is woefully easy (with a philadelphus, for example) to knock them right off in your clumsy enthusiasm for cutting out the flowered wood. If you leave the job until the winter, you'll be able to see, and judge, the bones of the shrub, and the young shoots will have toughened and no longer be inclined to drop off like the tip of a frightened lizard's tail. </p> <p>So you can get into those shrubs now and for the next month, if you haven't done so already. Leave all the straight, unbranched young wood intact and remove the old, intricately branched, flowered wood. This should be cut back either to where a strong, young shoot arises off the old stem or, if none such exists, right back to the ground (leaving no stumps or snags to get in your way when pruning in future). </p> <p>If the shrub doesn't need a legacy of wood on which to flower this year, but does it near to the ends of the young shoots that it will produce this year, then you can prune it hard back to stumps all over. These are the summer-to-autumn-flowering shrubs, such as the common Buddleia davidii , or the Spanish broom, Spartium junceum . Their pruning is normally delayed until March, with the idea that an earlier pruning might result, during a mild winter's spell, in their making new growth, only for it to be frosted if a cold spell followed. This danger can be exaggerated. I often prune if I'm there, ready to do it, rather than wait and then find I can't make the time to do it. I like to prune my hydrangeas, for instance, before their buds have expanded so far as to be easily knocked off, and that is often as early as March. </p> <p>Now let us suppose that you are confronted by a huge old philadelphus or Kerria japonica or weigela that has never been pruned in its life. If you're told, \"cut out the old wood and leave the new intact\", you'll rightly protest that there's no new wood to leave. Then you need to create the circumstances that will encourage new wood production (there are, I admit, cases where it'll be best to remove the old monster altogether and to start again). So, making your cuts (probably with a slim saw) as close to the ground as possible, remove whole branches and leave whole branches growing. Next winter, complete the job; remove the other half. If you wish to minimise the shock, you can do this all in thirds. The point is that the shrub will have been forced to make young shoots and, after two or three years, you'll be starting with a clean sheet. </p> <p>If you are pruning entirely for foliage effect, the method will be the same as for late-flowering shrubs: prune the shrub hard back all over. This encourages lush foliage production. Physocarpus opulifolius 'Dart's Gold' would be an example. You'll be sacrificing its flowers, but they are of no account anyway. The foliage is what you are interested in. </p> <p>I grow a number of shrubs for (often spurious) sub-tropical effect. Ultra-hard pruning encourages them to produce leaves of enormous size on a shrub, rather than smaller leaves on a tree. Typical examples would be the tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima (big, pinnate leaves); the big-leaf maple from the western US, Acer macrophylla ; Paulownia tomentosa , with huge, furry, rounded leaves (as a tree, it carries mauve, foxglove-like flowers); and Catalpa bignonioides 'Aurea', the golden-leaved catalpa. You can experiment with your own examples. </p> <p>It is the same principle as is used by exhibitors of hybrid tea roses, who want the largest blooms and encourage their production by ultra-hard pruning and ultra-heavy feeding. This treatment has a weakening effect on the plant's constitution. Its life will be shortened. You'll just have to accept this, and you'll have a replacement ready for when it's time for a changeover. You'll be well advised to change the site where the replacement is grown, as well. Certainly with roses</p>",

So, making your cuts (probably with a slim saw) as close to the ground as possible, remove whole branches and leave whole branches growing. Next winter, complete the job; remove the other half. If you wish to minimise the shock, you can do this all in thirds. The point is that the shrub will have been forced to make young shoots and, after two or three years, you'll be starting with a clean sheet. If you are pruning entirely for foliage effect, the method will be the same as for late-flowering shrubs: prune the shrub hard back all over. This encourages lush foliage production. Physocarpus opulifolius 'Dart's Gold' would be an example. You'll be sacrificing its flowers, but they are of no account anyway. The foliage is what you are interested in. I grow a number of shrubs for (often spurious) sub-tropical effect. Ultra-hard pruning encourages them to produce leaves of enormous size on a shrub, rather than smaller leaves on a tree. Typical examples would be the tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima (big, pinnate leaves); the big-leaf maple from the western US, Acer macrophylla ; Paulownia tomentosa , with huge, furry, rounded leaves (as a tree, it carries mauve, foxglove-like flowers); and Catalpa bignonioides 'Aurea', the golden-leaved catalpa. You can experiment with your own examples. It is the same principle as is used by exhibitors of hybrid tea roses, who want the largest blooms and encourage their production by ultra-hard pruning and ultra-heavy feeding. This treatment has a weakening effect on the plant's constitution. Its life will be shortened. You'll just have to accept this, and you'll have a replacement ready for when it's time for a changeover. You'll be well advised to change the site where the replacement is grown, as well. Certainly with roses",

That statement has trilled through my head all week like a snatch of Berlioz blasting out of a mobile phone in a crowded railway train. How it brings it all back: those long smoke-filled evenings in Les Deux Magots, disputing philosophical conclusions with Sartre and Weil, Jean Cocteau and Diaghilev, Henry Miller and Ana\u00efs Nin, Colette and Willy, Mistinguett and Josephine Baker, Stephane Mallarm\u00e9 and Stephane Grappelli, Sam Beckett, Anouilh and Les Six.

At least half of the orders from Open were new customers. </p> <p>Colin Halpern, Domino's chairman, said: \"The instant success we witnessed at the end of 1999 promises to be just the start of our e-commerce activities. By embracing e-commerce at such an early stage we have already earned a reputation as the primary food delivery brand in the UK both on the internet and interactive TV.\" </p> <p>Domino's delivered its first pizza in Britain in 1985 and is an offshoot of the privately owned US pizza delivery chain of the same name. </p> <p>The fast food group said it aimed within the next five to 10 years to sell around one-third of its pizzas through e-commerce. </p> <p>The company reported its maiden results yesterday after listing on Aim last November. Total sales grew from \u00a320.7m to \u00a325.6m while like-for-like sales jumped 5.6%. Profits before tax were up 25% to \u00a31.8m. However, once exceptionals were included the profit was \u00a31.35m and lower than in 1998. </p> <p>Domino's increased its number of stores from 175 to 201 in the year and intends to double that number in the next five years. </p> <p>Stephen Hemsley, chief executive, said at least one-third of the stores would be owned by the company. He said Ireland was expected to be a substantial growth market, with its new store in Limerick reporting initial weekly sales of \u00a320,000 - almost three times the average of other stores. Those sales have now fallen to levels of \u00a314,000. </p> <p>A final dividend of 29p increases the total payment to shareholders to 71p for the year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Domino's Pizza said in less than six months its online e-commerce site had accounted for a 2% slice of its UK delivery sales and web customers brought the group higher margins. Domino's, the UK's largest pizza delivery chain, said customers ordering over the internet and the interactive television service, Open, were spending 25% to 35% more than traditional customers. At least half of the orders from Open were new customers. Colin Halpern, Domino's chairman, said: \"The instant success we witnessed at the end of 1999 promises to be just the start of our e-commerce activities. By embracing e-commerce at such an early stage we have already earned a reputation as the primary food delivery brand in the UK both on the internet and interactive TV.\" Domino's delivered its first pizza in Britain in 1985 and is an offshoot of the privately owned US pizza delivery chain of the same name. The fast food group said it aimed within the next five to 10 years to sell around one-third of its pizzas through e-commerce. The company reported its maiden results yesterday after listing on Aim last November. Total sales grew from \u00a320.7m to \u00a325.6m while like-for-like sales jumped 5.6%. Profits before tax were up 25% to \u00a31.8m. However, once exceptionals were included the profit was \u00a31.35m and lower than in 1998. Domino's increased its number of stores from 175 to 201 in the year and intends to double that number in the next five years. Stephen Hemsley, chief executive, said at least one-third of the stores would be owned by the company. He said Ireland was expected to be a substantial growth market, with its new store in Limerick reporting initial weekly sales of \u00a320,000 - almost three times the average of other stores. Those sales have now fallen to levels of \u00a314,000. A final dividend of 29p increases the total payment to shareholders to 71p for the year.",

      "bodyText": "A detective with alleged corrupt links to the gangster father of one of the Stephen Lawrence murder suspects has been allowed to retire from the Metropolitan police and keep his pension. Sir William Macpherson's report expressed dismay that Detective Constable David Coles continued as a serving officer despite having unauthorised meetings \"in the most suspicious circumstances\" with Clifford Norris. Norris was later jailed for drug smuggling, and his son, David, was one of the five prime suspects in the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. The Guardian has learned that Mr Coles, at the centre of corruption allegations at the inquiry, retired on medical grounds on February 10. He had been on sick leave since June 1998, and will be entitled to a police pension, believed to be up to \u00a320,000 a year. The Stephen Lawrence inquiry heard that undercover officers from customs and excise had seen Mr Coles meeting Clifford Norris three times in 1988 in the Tiger's Head public house in Chislehurst, south-east London. Customs officers observed packages being exchanged, and at one stage Mr Coles produced a calculator and was seen making notes. After the third meeting, Norris, the target of a major customs operation, went on the run before he could be arrested. Mr Coles was a sergeant in the flying squad at the time. Disciplinary charges were filed against him over an unrelated incident and a hearing recommended his sacking. But on appeal that was reversed and Mr Coles was demoted to detective constable. He was warned over his meetings with Norris but allowed to continue as a serving officer. The public inquiry referred to Mr Coles as Sergeant XX. In his report Sir William wrote: \"It seems to us right that we should register our concern that this aspect of Sergeant XX's association with Clifford Norris was not formally pursued and that the disciplinary penalties which were subsequently imposed appear lax, particularly since they resulted in the continued em ployment of Sergeant XX in the CID in the same area of London. \"Regardless of the fact that the association was not subject to formal discipline procedures, it was plainly highly suspect.\" Asked at the public inquiry in June 1998 about Mr Coles's continued employment, Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston said: \"On the facts as put to me, I'm appalled that this particular individual is still working for the Metropolitan police.\" The public inquiry also heard that Mr Coles had been assigned to guard Duwayne Brooks, the main witness to Stephen Lawrence's murder, during the Old Bailey trial of three of the suspects. Mr Brooks said: \"Yet another officer has slipped the net. I am no longer surprised.\" No officer criticised in the Macpherson report lost a day's pay. Paul Wilson, chairman of the National Black Police Association, said Mr Coles's departure on a police pension would be seen as a conspiracy. Mr Wilson, a serving Met officer, said: \"People will read into this that the Met has something to hide. The perception of the community will be that there's a conspiracy to get this guy out with as little publicity as possible. \"It is most unsatisfactory that the Lawrences were not told. They should be apprised of everything relating to the inquiry. \"It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, it really does.\" Scotland Yard confirmed that Mr Coles never faced a disciplinary hearing regarding his meetings with Norris. It would not discuss why. A source suggested that there was insufficient evidence to disprove beyond reasonable doubt Mr Coles's story that he was meeting Norris to try and cultivate him as an informant, though Scotland Yard sources have denied that there was any officially sanctioned effort to turn Norris into an informer. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: \"David Coles was medically retired from the Metropolitan police service as of February 10, following full medical scrutiny involving more than one doctor.\" The spokeswoman added: \"David Coles had completed 28 years' service at the time of his retirement.\"",

      "bodyText": "Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, yesterday denounced the jailing in Latvia of a former resistance fighter convicted of committing war crimes while fighting the Nazis and local collaborators in 1944. Vasily Kononov, 77, is the first anti-Nazi fighter to have been found guilty of war crimes in a country which has failed to prosecute Nazi collaborators and fascist militiamen for their roles in the slaughter of thousands of Jews in the Baltic republic during the second world war. Three weeks ago Kononov, a pro-Soviet partisan during the war, was jailed for six years for the murder of nine people in the east Latvian village of Mazie Bati in 1944 - the jailing that has enraged Russia. \"Latvia's repressive apparatus is increasingly targeting fighters in the anti-fascist resistance,\" Mr Putin said yesterday during a visit to Siberia. \"This might turn into a mass prosecution of fighters against fascism.\" Kononov denied involvement in murdering the nine Latvians. The killings were said to be reprisals for the deaths of 12 anti-fascist partisans and colleagues of Kononov during a battle in the village. Holocaust historians view Latvians as some of the Nazis' most eager accomplices during the war, while the present Latvian authorities have come under fire for failing to prosecute alleged war criminals who helped the Germans. Under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939 between Stalin and Hitler, the Russians occupied the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania in 1940, only to be driven out by the Nazi invaders the following year. Many Baltic nationalists, who were fiercely anti-Russian, fought alongside the Germans in driving the Russians out and then collaborated in the Holocaust. Konrad Kalejs - the former Latvian militiaman alleged to have taken part in the wartime mass murder of 30,000 people in Latvia - fled from Britain to Australia last month after the home secretary, Jack Straw, ruled he could not be prosecuted but ordered his deportation. Nazi-hunters, notably the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, have accused Latvia of being soft on ageing pro-Nazi war criminals, and Moscow has complained that the focus of the Latvian war crimes investigations is on anti-fascist partisans. While Latvia and neighbouring Estonia have hosted rallies of Nazi SS veterans in recent years, ageing partisans complain that their reunions have been banned. \"A man has been condemned for fighting fascism, an unprecedented world event,\" the Russian foreign ministry said of the Kononov verdict. \"This trial creates a dangerous precedent which could usher in a hunt for scapegoats.\" Several other former anti-Nazi fighters have been charged with war crimes in Latvia and one suspect is said to have committed suicide rather than surrender to the police. At the same time, the Latvians insist they have insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Kalejs, who was kicked out of the US and Canada before going to Britain. Prosecutors from Britain, the US, Canada, Israel, and Australia gathered in Riga, the Latvian capital, for two days this week to discuss the Kalejs case. Both the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and the Russian foreign ministry protested over their exclusion from the deliberations.",

      "bodyText": "Hope is dwindling that out-of- court negotiations in the Microsoft monopoly case will result in a settlement before next week's closing arguments, an unofficial mediation deadline. Neither the company nor the US justice department has given up on settlement talks before Richard Posner, the chief appellate judge in Chicago recruited to mediate. But two-and-a-half months into the negotiations the sides have remained so far apart that they continue to meet one- on-one with Judge Posner rather than face-to-face, people familiar with the talks said. In a sign that Microsoft is already looking beyond the settlement talks, it is cranking up a congressional lobbying campaign to fight a court ordered break-up of the software group. Microsoft and Justice also appear to be at odds over how any settlement or court ordered sanction would apply to the company's latest product, Windows 2000. Closing arguments are set for Tuesday before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in Washington, who has ruled already that Microsoft has monopoly power in personal computer operating systems with its Windows software. In his findings the judge said that Microsoft harmed consumers, stymied competitors and stifled innovation. He has yet to rule on whether those actions broke competition law, and that will be the focus of arguments next week. If Judge Jackson does rule against Microsoft, he would then consider sanctions -ranging from breaking up the company to enforced changes in its business practices. Nobody has ruled out the possibility that Judge Posner, a widely respected legal intellect and antitrust expert, can come up with a solution that will be acceptable to both Microsoft and the government. Settlement talks can continue after closing arguments, but time is running out. \"I'm not optimistic about a settlement,\" said a source close to the talks. \"There can't be a settlement between now and Tuesday - it's just too late.\" Judge Posner apparently has yet to give up on a settlement because he is still holding sessions with each side. Judge Jackson had warned attorneys that Judge Posner would end the talks if they seemed to be going nowhere. A good deal of time in those sessions has been spent reviewing the facts of the case, saving any discussion of actual settlement proposals for late in the process. Microsoft has argued to congressional staffers that it has put a good faith offer on the table - one that would require some sort of change in its conduct but which apparently has yet to satisfy the government. But industry attorneys advising the government are deeply sceptical about the potential of such plans to change the company's conduct. \"Nobody trusts Microsoft to disclose the information necessary to have the products of competitors inter-operate in a timely manner,\" one industry attorney said. Until now, Microsoft has avoided talks of a forced break-up and focused on discussing why it has not violated competition laws. But, in a fundamental shift in strategy, Microsoft lobbyists have begun outlining to congressional staff the problems that Microsoft believes loom with the government plan to seek a break-up of the group. Meanwhile, the two sides seem to disagree on how the fundamentals of the case relate to Windows 2000. Microsoft officials see significant code and product differences between Windows 2000 and earlier versions of Windows. But justice department lawyers and the 19 states involved in the case view Windows 2000 as the successor to the monopoly software Judge Jackson addressed. The importance of the issue arose last week when complaints made by competitors were aired by the European commission's competition directorate. They complained that Microsoft had bundled the desktop version of Windows 2000 with Windows 2000 for servers \"in a way which permits only Microsoft's products to be fully operable\". \u00a9 The Washington Post",

He had them in hysterics for six hours with jokes about the Ku Klux Klan, their laughter an implicit acknowledgement of the black experience. </p> <p>The day after the Gregory programme, Andy Kershaw began a new six-part Radio 2 series retracing the journey from Virginia to California taken by Chuck Berry's po' boy in his 1963 song The Promised Land. </p> <p>In programme one Kershaw also recalled the segregated South of the early 60s: remarkably, it was only in 1961 that African-Americans got the vote. Kershaw has made the musical travelogue his own, but it remains to be seen whether the historical dimension here won't cramp his extemporising skills. Given the persistently shoddy treatment he's received on Radio 1, it can't be long before he decamps to Radio 2 permanently. </p> <p>Kershaw is a world music specialist, but Radio 3's luminous four-part series on Indian devotional music, Nights of the Goddess, makes one wonder about the usefulness of labelling Indian classical music \"world music\", as though it had more in common with reggae than Bach. Jameela Siddiqi guides us round festivals and concerts where the secular and the religious meet in demonic mandolins and lustrous ragas. Bombay, she told us, is now called Mumbai after the goddess Mumba Devi, and she rolled its vowels so melodiously that the city's very name seemed like music.</p>",

Gregory's big break came when he was accidentally booked to do a night at a Hugh Hefner Playboy Club in Chicago for an audience of Southern white men gathered for a frozen food convention. He had them in hysterics for six hours with jokes about the Ku Klux Klan, their laughter an implicit acknowledgement of the black experience. The day after the Gregory programme, Andy Kershaw began a new six-part Radio 2 series retracing the journey from Virginia to California taken by Chuck Berry's po' boy in his 1963 song The Promised Land. In programme one Kershaw also recalled the segregated South of the early 60s: remarkably, it was only in 1961 that African-Americans got the vote. Kershaw has made the musical travelogue his own, but it remains to be seen whether the historical dimension here won't cramp his extemporising skills. Given the persistently shoddy treatment he's received on Radio 1, it can't be long before he decamps to Radio 2 permanently. Kershaw is a world music specialist, but Radio 3's luminous four-part series on Indian devotional music, Nights of the Goddess, makes one wonder about the usefulness of labelling Indian classical music \"world music\", as though it had more in common with reggae than Bach. Jameela Siddiqi guides us round festivals and concerts where the secular and the religious meet in demonic mandolins and lustrous ragas. Bombay, she told us, is now called Mumbai after the goddess Mumba Devi, and she rolled its vowels so melodiously that the city's very name seemed like music.",

To believe that the way things look is more important than the way things are is as good a definition of cretinism as I have ever heard. That's why Naomi Campbell's periodic hissy fits about the \"racism\" of fashion and beauty always ring so hollow - she has a point but, in a business built on making the fat, the old and the plain invisible, why should blackness be sacrosanct, or \"represented\" in some way?

The point is that anything that can be fashionable must, by definition, become unfashionable. Of all the industries, fashion is the very personification of capitalism, because, unlike cars or computers, which you're meant to replace when they get old, you're meant to replace your clothes three times a year and chuck the old ones away, even though they are still perfectly serviceable. That is the whole point of fashion, and precisely why the whole 90s thing about fashion people pretending to care about \"The Planet\" was such a huge, brilliant joke. </p> <p>So let us not castigate the likes of Puffy Combes, Tommy Hilfiger and John Galliano for draping their models in animal corpses (often with heads and paws left on), but rather give them three cheers for being so honest about the miserable, unimaginative business they tout their sad asses in. And three cheers, too, for those \"unspoilt\" daughters of Albion, Karen Elson (brown-and-white striped mink jacket at Carolina Herrera) and Erin O'Connor (fluffy Tuscan lamb collar at Marc Jacobs) for proving that a down-to-earth, working-class funny face can be every bit as morally incontinent as the most stuck-up supermodel goddess. </p> <p>It's like being at public school, being in the rag trade: you get bullied at first, and then it's your turn to be a callous, sociopathic wretch. Last year, Elson was rejected by Dolce &amp; Gabbana for being, at size 10, \"too fat\". The year before, she had been the toast of Milan. At 19, she was declared pass\u00e9 and superseded by 16-year-old Devon Aoki, the new favourite of Versace, Chanel, Yamamoto and Lagerfeld. Aoki looks permanently surprised, shocked by her good fortune. Hers is not a face that one can imagine ever expressing rebellion or contempt; neither are those of Audrey Marnay or Zora Star, two impressionable teenagers also being talked up by the designers and photographers who like their women young, dumb and grateful. These girls are, above all, passive, as the fashion writer Mimi Spencer put it after observing them up close: \"They look disconcertingly inexperienced - not merely in a sexual way, but in every sense imaginable. In magazines and on catwalks, they look like girls who have never opened a book, a can of soup, a door.\" </p> <p>It was disgusting to behold the recent spectacle of raddled old designer queens, all living like princes and as right-wing as kings, coming on like some Marxist scourge about how disgustingly over-paid supermodels are. \"Times are changing, and they have to realise that there is a world-wide economic crisis,\" said a Fendi spokesman on why his house no longer wanted to employ supermodels. But none of the designers seems to have considered the notion that the fashion houses themselves, as well as the supermodels, might consider charging less for their grossly inflated products. </p> <p> If Claudia Schiffer is \"a joke, finished\", what does Karl Lagerfeld think he is? If supermodels are so stupid, how come it's Christy Turlington and not Jean-Paul Gaultier who has gone back to college? No, the supermodels' crime was not greed and temper - which are taken as proof of highly-strung genius in male designers - but changing from malleable, mouldable girls into women who dared open their mouths and express opinions. Worst of all, they insulted the great god Fashion itself. \"It was a very dull point in fashion; people needed to gossip about us to make fashion more interesting,\" said Turlington of the start of the supermodel feeding frenzy. </p> <p>The supermodels saved their money and got out: Schiffer and Elle Macpherson into films, Crawford into being Cindy Inc, Christiansen into photography.

Thus the powers that the Angels had (linguistic skills, martial arts proficiency and, in Farrah Fawcett's case, a fast hand with a high-powered hair dryer), which on paper may have cheered feminists, were not their own, but were directed by some sexist creep on the other end of a phone. As a result, as the late 70s turned to the early 80s, women TV viewers had to transfer their hopes to Cagney and Lacey. </p> <p>In Charmed, too, the witches' supernatural skills, which one might have thought would give them autonomy in a male- dominated world, are only a source of worry to them. They unwittingly inherited their powers from their ancestors and are assailed by envious warlocks, trolls and other people with green contact lenses. In terms of the show's visual tropes, this means that the girls are all-too-often a clump of decorous open-mouthed reaction shots, the very picture of gormless, if putatively sexy, fluffheadery. </p> <p>Still, the dopier American critics have affected to like Charmed.

Dr Akbar Ahmed is the first competent person in his job and has taken up the Kashmir issue and exposed Indian terrorism there.</p> <p>Naturally Indians are upset, hence a spate of baseless attacks are emerging to discredit him. The high commissioners before him were totally inactive, just looking after the wealth of their political masters. Film director Jamil Dehlavi, though Pakistani by birth, belongs to that elite class who were brought up and educated at the expense of Pakistan and have no love or sense of loyalty to the country. <br> <b>Bashir Malik <br> Cambridge </b><br><br>\u0095 I was the first British actor to be offered a part in the film Jinnah. The first draft screenplay I read was by Guy Slater and Akbar Ahmed. When Jamil Dehlavi was engaged as director he and I met several times to discuss the project. The next draft screenplay contained several new scenes and alterations by Mr Dehlavi. I didn't know how much of the first draft, if any, remains in the filmed screenplay. But there is clearly a lined if not a linear descent from one to the other and it would be ludicrous to suggest that Mr Ahmed, as the author of the project, had \"misappropriated\" funds paid to him as scriptwriter, if the suggestion were not so calumnious and politically motivated. I'm sorry that Jamil Dehlavi, a director whose work I admire, has allowed himself to be embroiled in this calumny.<br><b> Corin Redgrave <br> London </b><br><br>\u0095 In Kashmir where gross human rights violations - rape, murder and torture - continue, as can be confirmed by Amnesty International, about 70,000 civilians have been killed. Even today there are 700,000 troops occupying Kashmir. So by pushing Pakistan into the corner and labelling it a \"terrorist state\", India will kill two birds with one stone: neutralising Pakistan and isolating Kashmir.</p> <p>The Indian propaganda is working. Pakistan is often seen as a troublemaker, fomenting violence in Kashmir and harbouring designs on India. But India has a population of one billion, an aggressive nuclear programme and the fourth largest army in the world, which it has used ruthlessly, both internally - against Sikhs and Kashmiris - and externally.</p> <p>Yet if you ask an average American or European to associate images with India, these would be of Gandhi, yoga, Ayuvedic medicine and the Maharishi. For Pakistan it would be Islamic fundamentalism and the threat to democracy under military rule. These images have become so strong that while people talk of \"an Islamic bomb\", no one mentions \"a Hindu bomb\".</p> <p>There are almost a million Pakistanis in Britain - and a large number in the US.

      "bodyText": "Your article on the Pakistan high commissioner and Jinnah film project was a typical example of defaming Pakistan by its enemies in the Indian lobby (Diplomat accused over film funds, February 17). Dr Akbar Ahmed is the first competent person in his job and has taken up the Kashmir issue and exposed Indian terrorism there. Naturally Indians are upset, hence a spate of baseless attacks are emerging to discredit him. The high commissioners before him were totally inactive, just looking after the wealth of their political masters. Film director Jamil Dehlavi, though Pakistani by birth, belongs to that elite class who were brought up and educated at the expense of Pakistan and have no love or sense of loyalty to the country. Bashir Malik Cambridge \u0095 I was the first British actor to be offered a part in the film Jinnah. The first draft screenplay I read was by Guy Slater and Akbar Ahmed. When Jamil Dehlavi was engaged as director he and I met several times to discuss the project. The next draft screenplay contained several new scenes and alterations by Mr Dehlavi. I didn't know how much of the first draft, if any, remains in the filmed screenplay. But there is clearly a lined if not a linear descent from one to the other and it would be ludicrous to suggest that Mr Ahmed, as the author of the project, had \"misappropriated\" funds paid to him as scriptwriter, if the suggestion were not so calumnious and politically motivated. I'm sorry that Jamil Dehlavi, a director whose work I admire, has allowed himself to be embroiled in this calumny. Corin Redgrave London \u0095 In Kashmir where gross human rights violations - rape, murder and torture - continue, as can be confirmed by Amnesty International, about 70,000 civilians have been killed. Even today there are 700,000 troops occupying Kashmir. So by pushing Pakistan into the corner and labelling it a \"terrorist state\", India will kill two birds with one stone: neutralising Pakistan and isolating Kashmir. The Indian propaganda is working. Pakistan is often seen as a troublemaker, fomenting violence in Kashmir and harbouring designs on India. But India has a population of one billion, an aggressive nuclear programme and the fourth largest army in the world, which it has used ruthlessly, both internally - against Sikhs and Kashmiris - and externally. Yet if you ask an average American or European to associate images with India, these would be of Gandhi, yoga, Ayuvedic medicine and the Maharishi. For Pakistan it would be Islamic fundamentalism and the threat to democracy under military rule. These images have become so strong that while people talk of \"an Islamic bomb\", no one mentions \"a Hindu bomb\". There are almost a million Pakistanis in Britain - and a large number in the US. Most of them are good citizens who have contributed significantly to their new countries. In Britain, they have made and are making a major impact and there are now politicians, mayors and councillors of Pakistani origin. Those in the government and the Pakistani community should pause and consider the implications of declaring Pakistan a \"terrorist state\". The shadow of this will fall on their children, families, businesses and social lives. India should realise that it shares the same enemies as its neighbour - a population explosion, poverty, the degradation of the environment, and a spiralling trend towards ethnic and religious intolerance. The subcontinent could be a vast powerhouse for the world, with its huge reservoirs of talent, brains and energy, if its people could work together.

Lastminute. com had sales of \u00a32.6m and earned \u00a3190,000 for its owners in the year to September 1999. It is valued at \u00a3400m.

The gap between the valuations given to \"growth\" stocks and to those which had become mature remained more or less constant for most of the nineties. Analysts measure this by dividing share prices by after tax earnings. During this period growth stocks sold on around 27 times earnings while the others traded on 12 times.</p> <p>But over the past months the growth stock ratio has nearly doubled while the rest of the market has sunk back. Rubinsohn says: \"The old economy or value end of the equity market looks historically attractive.

The gap between dot.com and old economy company is clear. Lastminute. com had sales of \u00a32.6m and earned \u00a3190,000 for its owners in the year to September 1999. It is valued at \u00a3400m. Thompson Travel Group is worth \u00a3740m - nearly twice as much - but on sales more than 500 times higher. All this leaves companies in the secret bear market looking very cheap. The gap between the valuations given to \"growth\" stocks and to those which had become mature remained more or less constant for most of the nineties. Analysts measure this by dividing share prices by after tax earnings. During this period growth stocks sold on around 27 times earnings while the others traded on 12 times. But over the past months the growth stock ratio has nearly doubled while the rest of the market has sunk back. Rubinsohn says: \"The old economy or value end of the equity market looks historically attractive. And some companies in building and retailing are seeing profits forecasts upgraded.\" And he warns that \"the higher the fashionable stocks go, the greater the risk that a setback will occur\". Fund managers are starting to take notice of the value argument. Geoff Miller at Exeter Asset Management believes it is time \"to change investment strategy from growth into more value orientated situations.\" He likes companies such as British Land, whose share price stands at a 40% discount to the underlying value of the properties in its portfolio, housebuilders where Barratt has seen a shares collapse despite record sales; train operator FirstGroup whose share price has halved over the past year despite good cash flows and even British Telecom, caught betwen technology and utility status. Others whose valuations have slid include (with recent and 12 month high prices) are: Imperial Tobacco (430p-789p); Debenhams (151p-502p); British Energy (250p-680p); bus group Arriva (140p-440p) and sugar group Tate &amp; Lyle (216p- 500p).",

Term insurance is the simplest and cheapest form of life cover, especially suitable for families on tight budgets. It is designed to provide cover for a specific period, say during the term of a mortgage or until children are grown up. If you survive it pays nothing.</p> <p>You can choose a term policy that pays out a one-off, tax-free lump sum on death or a family income benefit policy, which pays a monthly, tax-free income after death for the remaining term of the plan. The latter is useful for dependants who need a regular income without the hassle of investing a lump sum.</p> <p>Term insurance does not cost as much as one might expect, but premiums vary dramatically for the same cover so it is worth shopping around.</p> <p>Critical illness cover, which pays out a tax-free lump sum if you are diagnosed as suffering from one of a pre-defined list of serious conditions such as a heart attack, kidney failure or cancer, is expensive compared with term insurance but arguably as important.</p> <p>A healthy man or woman stands a one-in-5 chance of suffering a critical illness before reaching the age of 65. And, of the one in eight healthy women who will contract cancer before they are 65, 70% will survive for more than a year after diagnosis and 50% for more than five years. The payout from a critical illness policy can be used to replace the patient's income and to cover costs such as nursing care.</p> <p>It is easier to compare critical illness premiums, since the introduction of a set of standard terms and conditions to which most insurers adhere.</p> <p>Barry Davys of Davys Direct says clients tend to choose critical illness cover over permanent health insurance. \"Most people prefer the lump sum paid out by critical illness policies to the regular income from PHI,\" he says. \"PHI policies also won't necessarily pay out if you become ill or disabled but are still able to work and policies usually have a 'deferred period' so you have to be off work for a month, three months or even a year before you can start claiming. Critical illness policies have the advantage of paying out on diagnosis.\"</p> <p>Cost comparisons are available from Davys Direct on 08457 660 559 or at <a href=\"http://www.davysdirect.co.uk  \" target=\"_NEW\">www.davysdirect.co.uk. </a></p>",

The key products to consider are life insurance, critical illness cover, and replacement income cover or permanent health insurance (PHI). Term insurance is the simplest and cheapest form of life cover, especially suitable for families on tight budgets. It is designed to provide cover for a specific period, say during the term of a mortgage or until children are grown up. If you survive it pays nothing. You can choose a term policy that pays out a one-off, tax-free lump sum on death or a family income benefit policy, which pays a monthly, tax-free income after death for the remaining term of the plan. The latter is useful for dependants who need a regular income without the hassle of investing a lump sum. Term insurance does not cost as much as one might expect, but premiums vary dramatically for the same cover so it is worth shopping around. Critical illness cover, which pays out a tax-free lump sum if you are diagnosed as suffering from one of a pre-defined list of serious conditions such as a heart attack, kidney failure or cancer, is expensive compared with term insurance but arguably as important. A healthy man or woman stands a one-in-5 chance of suffering a critical illness before reaching the age of 65. And, of the one in eight healthy women who will contract cancer before they are 65, 70% will survive for more than a year after diagnosis and 50% for more than five years. The payout from a critical illness policy can be used to replace the patient's income and to cover costs such as nursing care. It is easier to compare critical illness premiums, since the introduction of a set of standard terms and conditions to which most insurers adhere. Barry Davys of Davys Direct says clients tend to choose critical illness cover over permanent health insurance. \"Most people prefer the lump sum paid out by critical illness policies to the regular income from PHI,\" he says. \"PHI policies also won't necessarily pay out if you become ill or disabled but are still able to work and policies usually have a 'deferred period' so you have to be off work for a month, three months or even a year before you can start claiming. Critical illness policies have the advantage of paying out on diagnosis.\" Cost comparisons are available from Davys Direct on 08457 660 559 or at www.davysdirect.co.uk.",

      "body": "<p>Using a lump sum to pay off all or some of your mortgage can save you and your family thousands of pounds and cut short the length of your mortgage term by months or even years.</p> <p>And the best mortgage with which to make such payments is the increasingly popular flexible variety.</p> <p>Truly flexible mortgages should allow over and under payments, let you borrow back on payments already made, and offer payment holidays. They should also calculate interest daily.</p> <p>The Malhi family from Slough intend to save themselves more than \u00a380,000 and pay off their loan nearly six years early by making substantial overpayments in a few years' time. When housewife Indy, 29, goes back to work as a marketing assistant, they will use \u00a31,000 of her salary to make a lump sum payment each month. The Malhis - Indy, husband Kam and children Ryan, nearly three, and Gavina, one - took out a 25-year base-rate tracker mortgage for \u00a395,000 with Alliance and Leicester last October. They repay \u00a3558 a month.</p> <p>\"When the children are older I will go back to work and we will put nearly all of my salary into the mortgage,\" Ms Malhi says. \"We aim to spend the savings on a better quality of life for us and the kids. We will put the money into the children's education and have things like holidays which are a luxury at the moment.\"</p> <p>Flexible mortgages used to be the preserve of the wealthy; the payoff for flexibility was above average interest rates.</p> <p>But big lenders NatWest and Abbey National have just rushed out affordable products to join those on offer from the likes of the Woolwich and First Active Financial. The Abbey National deal offers a 1.1% discount for six months, taking the interest rate down to 5.65%. After that the rate is guaranteed to be no more than 1% above the base rate.</p> <p>Flexible mortgages are the best vehicles for making the most of lump sum payments because timing is crucial. Many mortgage lenders only credit payments to accounts once a year, so if you pay in several thousand to your mortgage in February it may not impact on the outstanding debt until the next January. Flexible mortgages offer a way round this problem because most calculate interest daily. There are no penalties and often no limits attached to making overpayments.</p> <p>Siobhan Hotten of independent financial adviser John Charcol says: \"They are a useful tool for reducing debt. Companies are competing on features and there is something for everyone in flexible mortgages.\"</p> <p>But some are more flexible than others. Check exactly how often over and under payments are allowed, and whether a minimum payment is required. The Bank of Scotland personal choice mortgage requires a minimum overpayment of \u00a3500. And the Woolwich open plan mortgage charges interest monthly rather than daily.</p> <p>Another type of flexible mortgage is a current account loan, which is a financial package complete with current account features. Virgin One and First Active Financial offer them.</p> <p>With this type of loan you can use your salary to help reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan. Since interest is calculated daily, there is an immediate benefit from the reduction in your mortgage balance when your wages are paid in. And that is without any extra payments.</p> <p>Take a woman with a 25-year mortgage who earns \u00a320,000 a year. If she put down a 20% deposit and borrowed \u00a370,000, she would pay 7.05% interest. The effect of her salary temporarily reducing her mortgage balance each month would save \u00a34,715 in interest and clear the loan nine months early. Less dramatic than the Malhi example, but no overpayments have been made.</p> <p>Interest is effectively being earned at the mortgage rate. Put another way, you are investing your money in a supersafe, high-interest rate environment. Paying off a mortgage early can be a better way of using extra cash than leaving it in low-return instant access accounts.</p> <p>A basic-rate taxpayer would need a savings account paying over 10% to find as good a home for spare cash as paying off the mortgage - higher-rate taxpayers would need nearly 13% - rates that simply do not exist.</p> <p>But Ms Hotten cautions that current account mortgages complete with ATM cards and drawdown facilities are only for the financially disciplined, not for those who ever have an overdraft as interest will mount up against them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Using a lump sum to pay off all or some of your mortgage can save you and your family thousands of pounds and cut short the length of your mortgage term by months or even years. And the best mortgage with which to make such payments is the increasingly popular flexible variety. Truly flexible mortgages should allow over and under payments, let you borrow back on payments already made, and offer payment holidays. They should also calculate interest daily. The Malhi family from Slough intend to save themselves more than \u00a380,000 and pay off their loan nearly six years early by making substantial overpayments in a few years' time. When housewife Indy, 29, goes back to work as a marketing assistant, they will use \u00a31,000 of her salary to make a lump sum payment each month. The Malhis - Indy, husband Kam and children Ryan, nearly three, and Gavina, one - took out a 25-year base-rate tracker mortgage for \u00a395,000 with Alliance and Leicester last October. They repay \u00a3558 a month. \"When the children are older I will go back to work and we will put nearly all of my salary into the mortgage,\" Ms Malhi says. \"We aim to spend the savings on a better quality of life for us and the kids. We will put the money into the children's education and have things like holidays which are a luxury at the moment.\" Flexible mortgages used to be the preserve of the wealthy; the payoff for flexibility was above average interest rates. But big lenders NatWest and Abbey National have just rushed out affordable products to join those on offer from the likes of the Woolwich and First Active Financial. The Abbey National deal offers a 1.1% discount for six months, taking the interest rate down to 5.65%. After that the rate is guaranteed to be no more than 1% above the base rate. Flexible mortgages are the best vehicles for making the most of lump sum payments because timing is crucial. Many mortgage lenders only credit payments to accounts once a year, so if you pay in several thousand to your mortgage in February it may not impact on the outstanding debt until the next January. Flexible mortgages offer a way round this problem because most calculate interest daily. There are no penalties and often no limits attached to making overpayments. Siobhan Hotten of independent financial adviser John Charcol says: \"They are a useful tool for reducing debt. Companies are competing on features and there is something for everyone in flexible mortgages.\" But some are more flexible than others. Check exactly how often over and under payments are allowed, and whether a minimum payment is required. The Bank of Scotland personal choice mortgage requires a minimum overpayment of \u00a3500. And the Woolwich open plan mortgage charges interest monthly rather than daily. Another type of flexible mortgage is a current account loan, which is a financial package complete with current account features. Virgin One and First Active Financial offer them. With this type of loan you can use your salary to help reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan. Since interest is calculated daily, there is an immediate benefit from the reduction in your mortgage balance when your wages are paid in. And that is without any extra payments. Take a woman with a 25-year mortgage who earns \u00a320,000 a year. If she put down a 20% deposit and borrowed \u00a370,000, she would pay 7.05% interest. The effect of her salary temporarily reducing her mortgage balance each month would save \u00a34,715 in interest and clear the loan nine months early. Less dramatic than the Malhi example, but no overpayments have been made. Interest is effectively being earned at the mortgage rate. Put another way, you are investing your money in a supersafe, high-interest rate environment. Paying off a mortgage early can be a better way of using extra cash than leaving it in low-return instant access accounts. A basic-rate taxpayer would need a savings account paying over 10% to find as good a home for spare cash as paying off the mortgage - higher-rate taxpayers would need nearly 13% - rates that simply do not exist. But Ms Hotten cautions that current account mortgages complete with ATM cards and drawdown facilities are only for the financially disciplined, not for those who ever have an overdraft as interest will mount up against them.",

One of the first financial institutions to offer a special product is a friendly society, Tunbridge Wells Equitable, which last summer launched a university bond offering investment opportunities for parents of children aged eight or under. This takes advantage of the \u00a325 a month tax-free savings entitlement of a child and gives with-profits endowments timed to mature at the beginning of each year of higher education. For those whose children are older, a way of finding funds may be for both parents to work or to remortgage the family home. Scottish Widows Bank has introduced an Education Fund Mortgage with a flexible borrowing approach and the capacity to overpay the mortgage in advance. You can remortgage your home and buy a property for the student's use. Your remortgage costs can be offset against rental from other students for tax purposes. Mark Ireland, an independent financial adviser from Winchgate Insurance in Bristol, says raising money on the parental home has the advantage of reasonable home loan rates. Students themselves can get a mortgage with a parent acting as guarantor. Nationwide and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester offer these.

      "body": "<p>I was recently in New Zealand on a literary visit sponsored by the British Council. At a book reading, a young white man asked me, \"Where are you from?\" England, I replied. \"You don't look English,\" he said. \"Well, this is what English looks like sometimes,\" I answered. He laughed in an unconvinced sort of way. So I asked him, \"What do you think an English person should look like?\" He pointed to another white person - a woman with fair hair, then to himself. Both of them were born and bred New Zealanders, but somehow they were more English than me. </p> <p>This was in a country where, later, while speaking to a Maori man in 70s, I was told that anyone with even the smallest fingerful of Maori blood is a Maori. No matter how tenuous the connection, no matter what country they live in, if they have Maori blood, then they are considered to be part of that culture. </p> <p>Identity! Sometimes it makes my head hurt - sometimes my heart. So what am I? Where do I fit into Britain, 2000 and beyond? </p> <p>My dad came to this country in 1948, on the Empire Windrush ship. He was one of the pioneers. One of the 492 people who looked around the old British Empire colony of Jamaica, saw that there were no jobs, no prospects, and decided to chance his arm in the Mother Country. His identical twin brother had been in the RAF, stationed in England, during the war, and was returning to do a further round of service. My dad accompanied him, leaving behind in Jamaica his new bride, my mum, who waited impatiently for the call to join him. </p> <p>I don't know what my dad's aspirations were when he arrived in Britain - he certainly didn't realise that he was making history at the time. But I do know that, when he boarded the ship, he knew himself to be a British citizen. He travelled on a British passport. Britain was the country that all Jamaican children learned about at school. They sang God Save The King and Rule Britannia. They believed Britain was a green and pleasant land - if not the centre of the world, then certainly the centre of a great and important Empire that spanned the globe, linking all sorts of countries into a family of nations. Far from the idea that he was travelling to a foreign place, he was travelling to the centre of his country, and as such he would slip-in and fit-in immediately. Jamaica, he thought, was just Britain in the sun. </p> <p>There was a point when my mum had doubts about this emigration, on hearing stories of the treatment the first travellers had received. She wanted my dad to return. But it was too late; he already loved England by then. On the passenger list, the twin brothers are put down as having different ages, which might have been a clue. My dad wanted to be his own man, and England was the place to do it. </p> <p>(I've switched from saying Britain to saying England. Britain is the state. You're only British when you're outside the islands. When, for example, I'm in Europe or America, I'm British. It makes me feel somehow bigger. But as soon as I set my feet down on the land of Britain, I know I'm either in England, Scotland, Wales or Ireland - separate countries without any doubt.) </p> <p>My mum joined my dad in his one room in west London six months after the Windrush had docked. But they soon found that they were foreigners in England, and this shocked them. The things they thought of as quintessentially English - manners, politeness, rounded vowels from well-spoken people - were not in evidence. They suffered bad housing - by no means the plight of black people alone in those post-war days: the signs in windows read \"no niggers, no dogs, no Irish\". My dad faced incredible hostility when looking for somewhere to live because of the colour of his skin. He had a job with the post office. My mum, a trained teacher in Jamaica, had to sew to make a living here. She worked in sweat-shops w ith other foreigners - Czechs, Poles, Greeks - all fall-out from the war. She had one advantage: she spoke English. And one disadvantage: she was black (or coloured, as we were termed then). </p> <p>It was when my brother, sisters and I were born that things began to get a little more complex. We were good citizens of this country (although the police did their best to thwart my brother in this). Never in trouble. Always polite. Never diddled the electricity meter. We lived in a council flat in Highbury, north London, next to the Arsenal football ground. In the world outside our flat, I was a north London girl. I went to the local school. Spoke like a cockney. Offered to mind people's parked cars on match days. Played rounders, skipping and two balls. I liked Mojos and gobstoppers; could blow a great bubblegum bubble. On TV I watched Coronation Street, Emergency Ward Ten, Dr Who. Cathy Come Home made me fear homelessness. The Sound Of Music made me long to be Julie Andrews. (I even convinced myself I looked like her - but no one else could see it.) </p> <p>At school, they taught me to read, write and do arithmetic (well, with the last one, heaven knows they tried). I studied Shakespeare and the Metaphysical poets. I learned to play the piano, and could sing and accom pany myself to Greensleeves. I learned history - focusing on Gladstone and Disraeli - where at one time I truly did know all about the repeal of the Corn Laws and free trade. (None of this was unusual to my parents: it was what they had learned in their schools in Jamaica.) </p> <p>I was educated to be English. Alongside me - learning, watching, eating and playing - were white children. But those white children would never have to grow up to question whether they were English or not. </p> <p>I was embarrassed that my parents were not English. One of the reasons was that no one around me was interested in the country my parents came from. To them, it was just a place full of inferior black people. They asked - oh, they asked all the time. \"Where are you from?\" was as constant a noise as a ticking clock. But if I answered \"Jamaica\", lips would curl or tongues would tut. They didn't want to know about the sun, the sugar cane, the rum punch. They didn't want to try our rice and peas. I remember a white American girl coming to school. You'd have thought that Doris Day herself was now a pupil. Everyone wanted to be her friend. To see her toys, to hear her parents' wonderful accent, to try their food with an \"Ooohh isn't it lovely\". America was a great place to come from. </p> <p>Everything from Jamaica was odd to me. We got a parcel sent every Christmas. (Were we the only family who received parcels from Jamaica and not the other way around?) A gooey Christmas cake from someone called \"my mother's mother\". A bowtie for my brother and hand-stitched dresses for us girls. But we kids preferred English Christmas cake with white icing that cracked your teeth. Woolly jumpers would have been better, we said. And my brother sulked that the bowtie was guaranteed to get him teased beyond endurance. </p> <p>We had a tin of sweetcorn in the cupboard that had come from a Jamaican parcel. I remember my mum opening it and us kids running around excited. Not because we were keen to try it, but because it was so weird. I tasted a niblet and spat it out, saying it was disgusting. (This was the early 60s - bear with me - salad was exotic.) My dad liked a thing called guava and got all sentimental when he thought of it. I didn't know what it was. But I did know the lyrics of a song that went something like, \"Rub it on my belly like guava jelly\", and got very embarrassed when he mentioned it again. And both my parents danced about like lunatics when Miss Jamaica won Miss World. </p> <p>I wanted just to fit in and be part of everything that was around me, and these strange parents were holding me back. </p> <p>Then I grew up. </p> <p>More black people emigrated to England from the 50s onwards - from the Caribbean, from Africa. People came from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Uganda. People from across the old Empire coming home to the Mother Country. After all, didn't she owe us? Along with this immigration - this safety in numbers - came a new interest for me in the country my parents had left. I was gaining a fledgling sense of pride in having a Jamaican heritage. Tentative at first - Bob Marley records, saying the word '\"feisty\", practising sucking my teeth in front of the bathroom mirror. Until it grew into a need to visit Jamaica. </p> <p>My mum had recently been back after 40 years away. She came home telling me what a bloody awful place it had become. Hot, violent, poor. It was not the place she remembered. She still had family there, but most had now emigrated to America or Canada. My dad didn't want to go back, even to visit. He preferred his memories and told me wistfully that he had no one there now - no family, no friends. He had made his home England. He didn't want to miss the football. And without much problem he could now get his beloved guavas here. </p> <p>Jamaica is an island where - apart from the aboriginal population, the Arawak - people were brought as slaves or indentured labourers. The white people there owned plantations and their workers. Some worked as overseers, the famously cruel bakra. Jamaica was a place of hard labour. The Jamaica I found was a brochure-beautiful island. A place where the colonists had left but, as we used to say in north London, \"they'd taken their ball home with them\". Taken the wealth, leaving an economy struggling with debt and trying to diversify so as to compete in a global market. </p> <p>However, the jewel in this island for me was my family. In Kingston, they welcomed me like a prodigal daughter. They told me that I looked like a Jamaican, even when I embarrassed them with my English ways - my liking for sitting in the sun, my insistence on making tea in a teapot and shivering in my woolly jumper, complaining about the \"Christmas breeze\". When I left, I wanted to know more about the people who formed me. </p> <p>It is hard for anyone to research their genealogy, but it is even harder (though not impossible) for someone with my background. Most of the records are incomplete or unavailable at best; destroyed or non-existent at worst. I discovered it would take a great deal of time, patience and expensive travelling for me to put together my definitive family tree. So I did the next best thing. I talked to my mum. </p> <p>It was simple. I asked her to tell me everything she knew about everyone she could remember. My mum claims that when I was little I wasn't interested in her family background. I claim that I asked her all the time, but that she wouldn't tell me. I got the impression that she had come to this country to gain a future, not to dwell on a past. Whatever the truth of it, at some point, thankfully, we merged. I was interested and she was willing to tell. </p> <p>I learned about her grandfather - my great-grandfather - among many others. A man from Scotland who had flame-red hair. A fisherman who could turn his hand to anything and who liked to wash his money every Sunday. What was he doing so far from home in Jamaica? Where was his family? My mum didn't know - she only knew of him. I had to look in the Scottish history books to find that, like a reverse image of my dad's story, many men left the hardships of the Highland life to chance their arm in the Caribbean. This Scottish great-grandfather of mine left behind him the flaming hair, which my brother inherited and which got him teased beyond endurance. </p> <p>My father's father fought in the first world war with the British West Indies Regiment. He was born Jewish. His family had been in Jamaica for generations, but probably originated from North Africa. My grandfather had \"married out\", to a woman of Indian/ African/Spanish descent, and had taken the Christian faith while fighting in the war. His Jewish family disowned him and all his issue. </p> <p>And, further back, my \"mother's, mother's, mother's, mother\" was born a slave. She had children by her white English master, who probably had several other children by his slave women and by his white English wife. I don't know what happened to him, but maybe some of his other descendants are reading this now. </p> <p>The stories that I learned from my mum I pieced together into what I call a fictional family tree for my novel Fruit Of The Lemon. I tried to place those stories in context - where they belong - at the heart of a history that Jamaica and Britain share. There is a tendency to believe that the recent immigration into this country, started by my intrepid dad and others, was where our relationship began. But nothing could be further from the truth. There was an excellent programme on Channel 4 recently about Britain's slave trade , which showed the extent to which many of England's aristocratic families gained their wealth through slavery. Cities such as Bristol and Liverpool were built with the money from the slave trade. What the programme also showed was that not only do black people have ancestors who are white, but also some ordinary British white people are connected by family ties to the black people of the Caribbean or to the estimated 20,000 black people who settled in Britain as a result of the trade. The history of Britain is inextricably linked with that trade, and therefore with somewhere like Jamaica. Indeed, without the trade in slaves Jamaica as we know it would not exist. </p> <p>When you look at family trees - anybody's family tree, people's individual histories, not the winner-takes-all history of nations - the question of identity becomes very complicated. It would be nice and simple if we were all pure. If we all came from where our parents, grandparents and beyond came from. If we all just took on our forefathers' culture. Wouldn't it be nice if we could say that all Africans are black and all English are white? Wouldn't it be simple if, when some racist (as many have done in my time) shouts at me to go back to where I came from, that I got an image of Jamaica in my head instead of thinking that I must go back to minding cars outside the Arsenal? It would make for easy argument - it would help the bigots' cause. We would all fit into our separate boxes, and in times of change, such as those that we are now living through, we could retreat into them and lick our wounds. But it is not like that. Any history book will show that England has never been an exclusive club, but rather a hybrid nation. The effects of the British Empire were personal as well as political. And as the sun has finally set on the Empire, we are now having to face up to all of these realities. </p> <p>Empire is over and, as Britain is being devolved down into its component parts, there is a loss of identity that has settled upon England. Darcus Howe, in his recent Channel 4 programme, White Tribe, went on a journey to find English culture, which so many believe resides only in the white population. Many blamed the multi-cultural nature of England for the country's plight. But this sense of loss was always going to happen - losing something as powerful as an empire will always hurt. It was going to happen even if my dad had not set sail on the Windrush; it was going to happen even if Idi Amin had not expelled the Asian population from Uganda. But perhaps the vitality of multi-culturalism is now the catalyst that is speeding up a necessary period of soul-searching. </p> <p>I am English. Born and bred, as the saying goes. (As far as I can remember, it is born and bred and not born-and-bred-with-a-very-long-line-of-white-ancestors-directly-descended-from-Anglo-Saxons.) England is the only society I truly know and sometimes understand. I don't look as the English did in the England of the 30s or before, but being English is my birthright. England is my home. An eccentric place where sometimes I love being English. </p> <p>When I hear that the surge of energy needed after a good television programme is because everyone is getting up to make a cup of tea, it makes me smile. I, too, was there with my teapot after the last episode of Only Fools And Horses. I love that our national dish has become curry. And the view from London's Waterloo Bridge just takes my breath away. I hate being English when I hear what happened to Stephen Lawrence. When every day seems like a battle against racism, and hatred, and the quiet, polite hostility that holds many black and Asian people back from fulfiling their potential. I want to belong to anywhere but this place where I am made to feel like an outsider - not welcome, definitely not welcome at all. </p> <p>Saying that I'm English doesn't mean I want to be assimilated; to take on the majority white culture to the exclusion of all other. (I cannot live without rice and peas. I now dance like a lunatic when Jamaica wins anything. And I will always make a noise when moved by emotion.) I will not take up a flag and wave it to intimidate. And being English will not stop me from fighting to live in a country free from racism and social divisiveness. </p> <p>There are many white people here who are appalled that someone like me could be English. And there are many black people with similar backgrounds to mine who do not wish to be called English. But national identity is not a personal issue. It is political. It cannot be decided at the whim of the individual. Englishness must never be allowed to attach itself to ethnicity. The majority of English people are white, but some are not. If we say otherwise, it is in tacit agreement with the idea of racial purity, and we all know where that dangerous myth can lead. Let England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland be nations that are plural and inclusive. </p> <p>Last year, I was in Scotland reading at the Edinburgh Festival. I was telling the audience about my great-grandfather with the flame-red hair. After the reading, a Scottish woman came up to me, held my arm and whispered, \"You know, I could just tell you were Scottish.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Andrea Levy's latest novel, Fruit Of The Lemon, is published this month in paperback by Review, priced \u00a36.99.

      "bodyText": "I was recently in New Zealand on a literary visit sponsored by the British Council. At a book reading, a young white man asked me, \"Where are you from?\" England, I replied. \"You don't look English,\" he said. \"Well, this is what English looks like sometimes,\" I answered. He laughed in an unconvinced sort of way. So I asked him, \"What do you think an English person should look like?\" He pointed to another white person - a woman with fair hair, then to himself. Both of them were born and bred New Zealanders, but somehow they were more English than me. This was in a country where, later, while speaking to a Maori man in 70s, I was told that anyone with even the smallest fingerful of Maori blood is a Maori. No matter how tenuous the connection, no matter what country they live in, if they have Maori blood, then they are considered to be part of that culture. Identity! Sometimes it makes my head hurt - sometimes my heart. So what am I? Where do I fit into Britain, 2000 and beyond? My dad came to this country in 1948, on the Empire Windrush ship. He was one of the pioneers. One of the 492 people who looked around the old British Empire colony of Jamaica, saw that there were no jobs, no prospects, and decided to chance his arm in the Mother Country. His identical twin brother had been in the RAF, stationed in England, during the war, and was returning to do a further round of service. My dad accompanied him, leaving behind in Jamaica his new bride, my mum, who waited impatiently for the call to join him. I don't know what my dad's aspirations were when he arrived in Britain - he certainly didn't realise that he was making history at the time. But I do know that, when he boarded the ship, he knew himself to be a British citizen. He travelled on a British passport. Britain was the country that all Jamaican children learned about at school. They sang God Save The King and Rule Britannia. They believed Britain was a green and pleasant land - if not the centre of the world, then certainly the centre of a great and important Empire that spanned the globe, linking all sorts of countries into a family of nations. Far from the idea that he was travelling to a foreign place, he was travelling to the centre of his country, and as such he would slip-in and fit-in immediately. Jamaica, he thought, was just Britain in the sun. There was a point when my mum had doubts about this emigration, on hearing stories of the treatment the first travellers had received. She wanted my dad to return. But it was too late; he already loved England by then. On the passenger list, the twin brothers are put down as having different ages, which might have been a clue. My dad wanted to be his own man, and England was the place to do it. (I've switched from saying Britain to saying England. Britain is the state. You're only British when you're outside the islands. When, for example, I'm in Europe or America, I'm British. It makes me feel somehow bigger. But as soon as I set my feet down on the land of Britain, I know I'm either in England, Scotland, Wales or Ireland - separate countries without any doubt.) My mum joined my dad in his one room in west London six months after the Windrush had docked. But they soon found that they were foreigners in England, and this shocked them. The things they thought of as quintessentially English - manners, politeness, rounded vowels from well-spoken people - were not in evidence. They suffered bad housing - by no means the plight of black people alone in those post-war days: the signs in windows read \"no niggers, no dogs, no Irish\". My dad faced incredible hostility when looking for somewhere to live because of the colour of his skin. He had a job with the post office. My mum, a trained teacher in Jamaica, had to sew to make a living here. She worked in sweat-shops w ith other foreigners - Czechs, Poles, Greeks - all fall-out from the war. She had one advantage: she spoke English. And one disadvantage: she was black (or coloured, as we were termed then). It was when my brother, sisters and I were born that things began to get a little more complex. We were good citizens of this country (although the police did their best to thwart my brother in this). Never in trouble. Always polite. Never diddled the electricity meter. We lived in a council flat in Highbury, north London, next to the Arsenal football ground. In the world outside our flat, I was a north London girl. I went to the local school. Spoke like a cockney. Offered to mind people's parked cars on match days. Played rounders, skipping and two balls. I liked Mojos and gobstoppers; could blow a great bubblegum bubble. On TV I watched Coronation Street, Emergency Ward Ten, Dr Who. Cathy Come Home made me fear homelessness. The Sound Of Music made me long to be Julie Andrews. (I even convinced myself I looked like her - but no one else could see it.) At school, they taught me to read, write and do arithmetic (well, with the last one, heaven knows they tried). I studied Shakespeare and the Metaphysical poets. I learned to play the piano, and could sing and accom pany myself to Greensleeves.

Majestic's Vi\u00f1a El Salado Extremadura 1998 (15 points, \u00a34.49), from Spain, is not so immediate, for it takes some seconds for the fruit to enrich the throat, but the wait is worthwhile.

      "body": "<p>This a tale of two restaurants. One has been with us in its present form for 10 years; the other for 10 months, more or less. One is its chef/patron's one pride and joy, the other part of a mini-chain. One is the idiosyncratic product of its owner's own rather idiosyncratic character. The other is sharply focused, sharply designed and sharply modish in the menu department. One is the Quality Chop House, a short shift from the Guardian's front door. The other is Parade, a slightly longer shift from my front door, in Ealing.</p> <p>I have written about the Quality Chop House before, and extolled the virtues of its proprietor, quondam Frenchman, habitu\u00e9 of the Groucho Club and short-order chef supreme, Charles Fontaine. To call him a short-order chef may seem to do him less than justice. Nothing could be further from my intention. It's just that the food on the menu seems plain: salmon fishcakes with sorrel sauce, liver and bacon, corned beef hash with fried egg, steak and chips, artichoke vinaigrette, potted shrimps. But this plainness becomes beauty when done with attention to each detail and brought to a state of consistent brilliance by much practice. These are, in short, the definitive examples of these dishes, and so are as satisfying as any you can eat anywhere. Basse cuisine becomes haute cuisine when pursued with such skill and vigilance.</p> <p>The salmon fishcake is a case in point. It comes on its own, a majestic tower of fishcake rising like a piscine Old Man of Hoy out of a sea of light, creamy sauce, whose emollient smoothness is flecked with little strips of lemony sorrel. The cake itself is a wonderful, harmonious balance of fish, potato and breadcrumbs, the whole miraculously light, with the subtle flavour of salmon permeating the mass. There is no need for teeth to eat such a fishcake. Just crush each forkful against the roof off your mouth with your tongue, thereby releasing the flavours, and then savour them and swallow slowly.</p> <p>Just as the menu has not changed much over the decade (although there are the odd nods in the direction of contemporary menu obsessions, such as the warm tuna salad, Ceasar salad, asparagus with pecorino, and roast sea bream with lemon and tomato), neither has the place. It is still the most uncomfortable restaurant in London - and, quite possibly, in Britain - but then it was that before Charles took it over. The backs to the bench seats are made from old doors and are set at an angle to encourage a rigid, straight-backed posture, rather than easeful slouching, and the tables are set just below a comfortable eating height, unless you happen to be significantly challenged in the height department. But Charles's genius was not to change it, bar chucking a pot of white paint at the walls, cleaning the place up a bit and, in time, adding on a second room next door. It remained quite identifiably the same place that it always had been: \"progressive working-class caterer\", as the legend etched into the shop-front window has it. The working classes may have changed a bit (but not that much: the bottles of Heinz tomato ketchup, HP sauce and Colman's mustard still sit on little ledges just above head height at each table) and the former clientele would wince at the prices (you should be prepared for around the \u00a320-\u00a325 a head mark), but the ethos of the place has not. It is still pretty bloody-minded and has the purity of obduracy about it. It is what it is.</p> <p>Parade could scarcely be further removed from this. It is brought to us by the team that made Sonny's in Barnes and Sonny's in Nottingham classics of the family-friendly, wallet-warming neighbourhood restaurant genre. It has clean, spare lines, with a hint Scandinavian sensibility - a kind of cross between John Pawson and Alvar Aalto. The walls are hung with pictures of a dazzling cheerfulness. It is a model of the carefully considered, well-thought-through, tasteful modern-eating experience. It is comfortable and well-run. And the menu is a model of modern eating - tuna tataki; crab cannelloni; warm salad of duck, Jerusalem artichokes, poached egg and balsamic vinegar; cep and field mushroom risotto cakes, mozzarella and rocket; roast cod; braised lamb shank; potatoes mashed, crushed or galetted; caperberries and lentils and onion marmalade and pinenuts.</p> <p>I have eaten in Parade twice recently, and both times you could not help but admire the intelligence of it. There were a couple of dishes that erred on the side of good manners when it came to flavours - when you serve butter with skate, for example, it must be black, not simply melted, and the capers must be plentiful to cut the rich-ness of the dish; and Old Fogarty complained that he expected a lot more oomph from a braised lamb shank than his actually delivered. Having said that, a ham hock, leek and parsley terrine with piccalilli was as sweet, chunky and hunky as the most devoted lover of chunky, hunky terrines could wish for; a saut\u00e9 of lamb neck and tongues with celeriac pur\u00e9e was perfectly calculated to keep the winter chill at bay; and, at another lunch, my elder brother gave a highly complimentary running commentary of a mountainous dish of sea bream with bouillabaisse sauce, noodles, courgette and squid, and he is no fool in gastronomic matters.</p> <p>The wine list is put together with care and good sense, and without the taint of financial greed that characterises too many London restaurants these days. In fact, with first courses priced at \u00a35.50, all main courses at \u00a312 and puddings at \u00a35, Parade sets its stall out with clarity and purpose. The two bills I paid there were \u00a364.80 and \u00a370.80 apiece, including wines, coffees and waters.</p> <p>The critical acclaim with which it has been greeted is unanimous, and I can't dissent from it. But, if I am honest, my heart belongs to the Quality Chop House. I can admire Parade. I can see that what it does, it does very well. But I cannot love it. It is a pasteurised cheese to The Quality Chop House's unpasteurised offering, a high-quality print to an original painting. There will be many who will prefer Parade's snap, crackle and pop to the Quality Chop House's steady, rhythmical beat, and who will not be able to understand my affection for the latter. That's fine. There's plenty of room for both</p>",

Warning: don't buy French mustard that isn't made in France. Warning: don't ever eat American mustard on anything except an American hot dog. The easy way out: Is that a joke? Where to buy: English: anywhere. And, yes, Colman's really is the one. French: anywhere, but far cheaper in France. Look for smaller, pricier brands to get ace vinegar.",

      "body": "<p>Matthew Hilton, one of Britain's leading designers, is going public. And not before time. Whereas the rest of the Brit pack - Ron Arad, Tom Dixon, Jasper Morrison et al - have found fame along with commercial success, Hilton's name, despite the huge popularity of his furniture, has remained unknown to all but the most design-savvy. His trad-meets-modern Balzac armchair and the curious, sculptural Flipper table are not only two of the Conran shops' best sellers, they are icons of late-90s loft living: so much so, that it is now almost impossible to open any glossy guide to loft life without seeing them, and London's Geffrye Museum has bought them for its 90s room. According to David Dewing, director of the museum, \"They are already classics of late-20th-century design.\"</p> <p>But Hilton himself has stayed out of the spotlight: no diffusion ranges, no shock tactics for the press, just consistently good-looking, functional furniture that people want to buy. Now, however, his approach is set to change - \"I think I could do with more attention,\" he says - and he is going public. But don't expect a signed range of kitchen accessories launched with razzmatazz. Hilton is a modest man, and though he admits that part of him wishes he \"could produce those things that break barriers\", he accepts that he isn't that type of designer. \"I don't seem to be like that. I suppose you have to accept what you are and get on with that.\"</p> <p>What Hilton is, however, is a designer who produces work which, says Dewing, is \"understated, honest and straightforward, which has been designed for a purpose, and never sacrifices the functional in favour of style\". So his new attempt to raise his profile will be a quiet thing, evolving, rather than exploding, from three separate events.</p> <p>The first is the Wait chair. Designed between 1998 and 1999, and manufactured by the German company Authentics, Wait is a modern take on the standard plastic stacking chair. Highly functional, seriously smart and very cheap, it has brought Hilton's work to a different and far wider public (there are 3,000 of them in the Dome, for example) and looks poised to usurp Robin Day's Polyprop as the nation's iconic plastic chair.</p> <p>\"I think it marks a change in my design,\" he says. \"I'm still interested in that SCP and Driade market [British and Italian manufacturers of very beautiful, very expensive furniture], but I'm also interested in a larger market. I'm more interested now with the things that concerned me at college. Making things that work, improving products, improving people's lives. Hopefully, this chair will be reaching those people who don't judge things the way people involved in the design community do.\"</p> <p>Hilton is obviously excited about this change of approach, and cites Wait as one of his favourite pieces. Asked if we can expect more mass-produced, high-quality, low-cost, contemporary classics, he nods, \"I hope so.\" And then he admits to the next profile-raising move - the job of head of furniture design at Habitat. His appointment is great news for everyone who lusts after serious contemporary design, but can't afford to spend a month's earnings on an armchair, and has generated the same kind of excitement that greeted Tom Dixon's appointment as the store's design director in 1998.</p> <p>Dixon himself is clear about why he wanted Hilton on board, describing him as a very experienced and considered designer, but Hilton wasn't easily persuaded. \"Tom started talking to me about nine months ago,\" he says. \"I had quite a difficult time deciding, but the thing that finally persuaded me was that there is a lot of positive energy there - people really want to do things - and the economy's good, and they have the resources. It feels like a good time. Ever since I started as a designer, people have been saying, 'I wish the market would grow. The rest of Europe won't sell here because they think the market's tiny,' but that's changing now. Companies like Habitat and Ikea are going to change things quite a lot. It's early days - I've only spent six days there [he begins properly in April] and we're trying to work out where we're going. I hope I'll be able to influence things and that they'll be pieces of mine for sale.\"</p> <p>The third profile-raising event is Matthew Hilton: the exhibition. Furniture For Our Time opened at the Geffrye Museum last Tuesday, and represents a major retrospective of Hilton's work. You can see the Tension table that he designed as part of his 1979 degree show and that was spotted by the specialist press. There are the first tubular steel pieces he did for SCP, the British manufacturing and retail company founded by Sheridan Coakley, so beginning an association that continues to this day and that Hilton describes as the most important working relationship he has. There is also the sculptural metalwork - pieces such as the swan candlesticks and 1988 Antelope table, the Shaker-inspired wood furniture and the famous upholstery, made for both SCP and Driade.</p> <p>Hilton was pleased to be asked to do the exhibition, glad to have a recognition that had nothing to do with commerce, and he likes everything that is in the show. He admits, however, to having found the process of selection, with its inevitable digging through the past, uncomfortable. \"I had to go back in my mind and look at pieces of work and think about why I was doing it - and that reminded me of lots of things that were happening at the time. I think things have changed a lot. I think that I was probably a lot more personally involved in my work and it was quite a struggle, so all that digging was quite difficult. I think I'm more nervous about putting my work into this situation than I ever have been about any trade show. It feels like there's going to be a lot of people watching and judging.\"</p> <p>No doubt there will be, but they are unlikely to be harsh judges - in Catherine McDermott's book that accompanies the show, an overwhelming number of design luminaries queue up to offer praise. Hilton maintains that all he is trying to do is \"design good things\", and now, at long last, more than just industry insiders are going to realise it.

But then, I was peering over most of their walls, trying to see what was in the back gardens as well as the front. Fortunately, I avoided the attention of the local constabulary, although walking the streets of a large proportion of residential Stratford-upon-Avon did take several hours of a Sunday morning. Nonetheless, had the long arm of the Warwickshire police decided to take an interest in my doings, I had an explanation ready: \"Good morning, officer, I'm just looking for some bamboo.\"</p> <p>In one sense, it's been a part of British gardening for ages; bamboo canes have supported our flopping perennials since, well, I'm not too sure: I suppose since the Orient was opened up to trade with the west. But, in truth, it wasn't canes that interested me. My survey constituted a search for living bamboo; bamboo as garden plants. And my mission was impelled by something that I had recently read in three separate newspapers and magazines: that bamboo is in fashion, that you must have bamboo in your garden, that it is the \"in\" thing to grow. Well, thank goodness, not in Stratford-upon-Avon, not yet, it isn't.</p> <p>I would be lying if I said that I didn't see any. There were three clumps of the rather pretty, yellow-striped Pleioblastus auricomus (Arundinaria viridistriata, for those with longer memories; the names of bamboos have undergone complete revision and contortion of late). But plainly, they had been there for ages and were approaching their replacement date. They certainly hadn't been planted in response to any recent edict of horticultural fashion. I saw one poor specimen of Shibataea kumasasa , the bamboo that is interesting for being untypical in its branched stems, and I even saw one fully Orient-influenced garden (inspired by a holiday in Hong Kong, perhaps; the house was called Dun China) in which something that I couldn't identify was clearly, like many of the hardier bamboos, making a serious takeover bid for the entire plot.</p> <p>And, I admit, I was interested to see a rather fine specimen of Nandina domestica 'Fire Power', the so-called sacred bamboo. Although it isn't a real bamboo (it's a member of the Berberis family), it does look very like one and provides a more manageable, hardy substitute for European gardens if an Oriental feel really is required. But that was it.</p> <p>My Sunday morning was given over to this research because I've long suspected that garden fashions have about as much relevance to real gardeners as the catwalks of London, Paris and Milan do to the clothes that people wear on the number 19 bus. Garden centres tell me that they haven't been aware of any special interest in bamboo over the past few weeks, so perhaps my fears aren't being realised. Or are they, because, awful to relate, friends in the trade did volunteer that they have had a good many enquiries about decking. And I know where that comes from, too.</p> <p>You can't switch on a gardening programme or open a book these days without a confrontation with wooden planks. And what a frightful waste of good space they are. The average garden today is less than 200 sq m. So what on earth possesses anyone to think we ought to cover it up with wooden boards, least of all with boards painted in bright colours? Decking is the stuff of stage sets and places to moor your boat. In the real world of real gardening it quickly becomes both unsightly and downright dangerous; try walking over wooden boards after a winter's rain and algae have had a go at it.</p> <p>It's one thing to guide people to new developments in gardening, to steer them in the direction of ideas that they may not have thought of or to suggest plants only recently available and that just might be improvements on something that went before. We used to do it weekly during my years on Gardeners' Question Time. But there's a big difference between doing that and suggesting that they must follow a style. I just don't like to see folk being urged to buy something that I know will either turn out to be useless or will give their garden a totally anachronistic feel. Let's be honest, most gardening fashion starts with people who do far too little gardening and far too much sitting in offices and thinking about it.</p> <p>British gardening is eclectic, always has been. That is its enduring glory. Like the British nation, it has evolved over the centuries and absorbed influences piecemeal. Yes, the word is evolved. It has never before been subject to the sudden, overnight change that has arisen not because of a process of natural selection but because of someone's whim or someone's response to the latest press release.</p> <p>Yes, of course, gardening has absorbed trends. The introduction of naturalism and the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement in the 19th century are among more familiar examples. Simultaneously, small groups of horticulturists found themselves thinking and working along similar lines, people saw their creations and tried them, before either retaining or rejecting them. But no one talked of \"must-haves\". You'll read a good many words of the really great garden designers, even recent ones such as Geoffrey Jellicoe, Sylvia Crowe, Gertrude Jekyll, Lawrence Johnston, or just possibly Vita Sackville-West, before you find \"fashion\".</p> <p>Of course, I'm not so blind that I can't see the reason. Gardening today is far less about real horticultural quality and far more about selling of products. And who are the losers? I think gardeners are, because they have been encouraged to think more in terms of doing what everyone else does and achieving results by the quick fix; and in the process failing to learn and appreciate that gardens are living, changing, dynamic entities with their own momentum. To think of gardens as you think of decor is to miss much of the satisfaction that the subject offers. No matter what the media tells you, gardens can't be treated like outdoor rooms.</p> <p>I imagine that the fashionable thrusting of bamboo into our lives comes partly from one or two bamboo nurseries suddenly becoming more commercially-minded and partly from the same source that has resulted in an entire section of my local bookshop being given over to feng shui. Someone has decided that, at the moment, the east is in. But much of the result of gardening in the Oriental manner is that British gardeners are being urged to cover up their gardens in a way that they haven't previously been covered up. That, I am sure, is where this wretched decking comes from, because a version of it does appear in some Japanese and Chinese gardens, where wood has always played a far more important role than it does in gardens of the European tradition. But the significant difference is that most of the wood in the former is there to be looked at, not to be walked on.</p> <p>If covering up your soil is truly what appeals to you, even if a bit of an Oriental influence is really what you want, let's look at something that is far more practical than decking, far more harmonious with our horticultural history, far cheaper, far easier to lay, far more versatile; and that doesn't entail wasting valuable growing space. Let's look at stone chips and gravel. Yes, there's still a smack of the Orient about them, although, in truth, I think that in the British gardening tradition stones and gravel really take their inspiration from nothing further east than Norfolk. The use of gravel in our gardens is derived far more from the shingle of places such as Blakeney than it is from Beijing.</p> <p>Gravel and stone chips have attributes that no decking ever will. They won't go rotten, they won't become slippery and, above all, they won't turn a large slice of your garden into a sterile, wooden wasteland. Plants will grow through gravel; and extremely handsome they will look. And in choosing plants that look appropriate for a gravel bed, by all means turn your attention to the grass family, the Poaceae , but not to the sub-family Bambusoideae , which really is alien to British gardening. Plant proper, non-woody grasses such as the blue-leaved Festuca glauca 'Blaufuchs', the gently rustling Briza media or the loveliest of all golden grasses, Milium effusum 'Aureum'.</p> <p>But don't, please don't, plonk a piece of something totally alien into your garden just because someone tells you it's the thing to do. I recall, not so long ago, a knowledgeable media gardening colleague telling me that, in his new series, he wanted to concentrate on real English gardening. Good news, I thought, and I watched the first programme. Almost the very first thing he did was to announce that, in the middle of his rural English plot, he was going to create a Mediterranean garden. I remember thinking at the time: Oh no, the press releases must have got him, too</p>",

      "bodyText": "The concluding words of The End Of Innocence (February 12), 'We seem to have forgotten what it was like to tres-pass gingerly into . . . the world of grown-up sexuality', should be addressed to those amnesiac adults who interrogate child suspects. We must stop punishing children for behaviour that is imitative, but innocent of the informed intent of its adult counterpart. Nothing guarantees a dysfunctional adult sexuality more than having sex indelibly associated with wrongdoing as a child. Belinda Braggins London SE23 When I was at primary school in the 50s, another boy persuaded me to look up the girls' skirts. I shall never forget the gentleness with which the teacher persuaded us not to do it again. When I read of those now prosecuting children left, right and centre, I begin to feel dirty, guilty and frightened; too frightened to sign this letter for fear of being branded. I begin to feel abused myself, by the zealots who have retrospectively criminalised my childhood. Anon 'It inevitably and rightly falls on us adults to guide and police children's sexual development'. Why? Patrick Selden Manchester How many other students have had a 'parse the glarse' experience (A Darker Blue, February 12)? Mine happened not amidst the spires of Oxford, but in the redbrick of Manchester. There was one fundamental difference, however: I did receive the requested drinking vessel. Linda Marshall Staines, Middx What a brilliant and touching extract from Stuart Jeffries' book. Compare with your cover story. I refer to the description of the R family: we are told that they dressed 'ferociously neatly', in 'fiercely ironed suits'; we read that the grandmother has a 'mock-antique phone'. Is this not exactly the same sneering, patronising attitude that Jeffries deplores? It demeans the writer of an otherwise fascinating piece. E Trussell Sudbury, Suffolk To use Brideshead Revisited as a yard- stick for complaining about the shortcomings of one's own experience of Oxford is as sensible as expecting every childhood holiday to resemble the adventure stories of Enid Blyton. nick@tucker.u-net.com Hunter Davies suggests that a miracle is about to be revealed at Spurs (After The Fall, February 12). George Graham's methodical organisation and bent for discipline is shaping his inner circle, and the promised land is but a leap of faith over the Thames. Did no one tell them that it took Moses 40 years and untold prayers to get there? Paul Harris Chatham, Kent Food, February 12: 'Steaming is claimed to preserve water-soluble nutrients that are lost by boiling, but this is largely a myth' - Peter Barham and Len Fisher. Food, February 12: 'Steaming is a fast, efficient method of cooking vegetables, conserving more nutrients than when boiled' - Joy Larkcom. Here's the truth: in steaming or boiling vegetables, bad fairies come and steal the nutrients, but good fairies steal them back and return them to the steamed ones only, but leave the boiled veg without nutrients and so unhappy.

      "body": "<p>Images Of England is a computer database of the country's 360,000 listed buildings. It is being compiled by the National Monuments Record for English Heritage. More than 500 volunteer members of the Royal Photographic Society are taking the individual pictures. The project, which is backed by the Heritage Lottery Fund, is due for completion in 2002. \"It will offer,\" says Victoria Fenner, leading the Images Of England team from an office in the former Great Western Railway works in Swindon, \"a snapshot of our listed architectural heritage.\"</p> <p>These are the facts. What more does anyone need to know? Nothing, perhaps, although we might ask why all the bother? What is it with the English and their obsession with conserving buildings? Surely, we, the forward-looking, strong and joyful citizens of New Britain, should by now have cured ourselves of our chronic nostalgia? Maybe, but we haven't, and it's very unlikely that we will, because we don't want to.</p> <p>We're more than fond of our architectural heritage, and will do almost anything to preserve the least-deserving Victorian pile. Or streamlined 30s factory, 50s school, 70s office block. Images Of England aims to enhance our knowledge of the stock of historic buildings we say we want not just to keep, but, as far as is technically possible, to keep from change.</p> <p>There are an awful lot of listed buildings in Britain. Perhaps you live in one. Perhaps, before long, there will be the conservation equivalent of the trainspotter who, in the days before \"passengers\" were demoted to \"customers\", would underline the numbers of engines he had \"copped\" in his locospotter's guide, and in a couple of years' time he (probably he) will be gurning outside your house, ticking it off his unfeasibly long list. Perhaps there will be a prize awarded to the first listed-building buff who checks out all 360,000. A candelit evening at Sir John Soane's Museum, Lincoln Inn's Fields. A weekend for two at the Grand Hotel, Scarborough. Drinks in the Lord Chancellor's apartment in the Palace of Westminster, to inspect, first-hand, the newly hand-printed Pugin wallpaper . . .</p> <p>Maybe. Yet our famous obsession with old buildings and heritage is a phenomenon that needs some unravelling. In so many walks of life, we are prepared to see our world change - in clothes, music, cars, food, holidays, ways of working, consumer goods. Buildings, however, are generally considered best when old, and modern architects are generally to be mistrusted. \"The only good architect,\" the historian and conservationist Gavin Stamp told me when I joined the Architectural Review as assistant editor, \"is a dead architect.\" Although meant in jest (but possibly not), Stamp's jibe summed up the feeling so many English people have nurtured since the second world war. While it is true that English architects made many mistakes, often at the behest of impatient developers and bombastic local authorities, the standard of architectural design in England has probably risen over the past 20 years, and we have much to be proud of.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we cling to the past as if history was some sort of constant companion. It isn't - history is as slippery a creature as a wet fish on a market stall. Our perception and interpretation of it changes with each new biography of a famous person, or study of some past civilisation. Yes, but not buildings. There they stand, immutable witnesses to the spirit of those who commissioned, designed, built and used them. Comfortable and reliable backdrops to our own lives. Old friends.</p> <p>Fine. But when does a building become an old pal? Where does history start, and what makes a building historic rather than simply old? When will conservationists start loving the Dome? What we felt was a hideous building when we saw it for the first time when we were 30 becomes a precious monument that we must save for the nation 30 years on. It doesn't seem that long ago - 20 years at the most - when the majority of architectural historians and conservationists railed against virtually any post-war building. Post first world war, that is. Buildings from the 20s on - unless they were designed by late-flowering Neo-Classicists such as Edwin Lutyens, Herbert Baker or Albert Richardson - my dears, there was no hope for them. Pretentious, pseudish, meretricious trash, designed or copied from designs by lying, tricky foreigners.</p> <p>For an earlier generation - those born in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, and trying to escape it - the fronds and prickles of high-Victorian architecture were inept and vulgar. When Kenneth Clark (Lord Clark of Civilisation) published The Gothic Revival in 1929, in which he enthused about the re-creation of medieval style, it was widely thought to be a squib, a tease, a wind-up. His contemporaries, John Betjeman, then assistant editor of the Architectural Review (and, much later, poet laureate) and Osbert Lancaster, the gifted pocket cartoonist, were thought to be taking the mickey out of contemporary architects when they used their precocious gifts to support the prickly churches and houses of such celebrated Victorian Goths as Pugin, Butterfield and Street, of Pearson, Bodley &amp; Garner and Temple Moore.</p> <p>They weren't. In fact, Betjeman's genius, often misunderstood, was to promote the best contemporary architecture (he was a member of MARS - Modern Architecture Research, the English arm of CIAM, the Comit\u00e9 Internatiaux d'Architecture Moderne founded by Le Corbusier and gang on the continent) while deriding most of it (because so much was so bloody awful), and to open our eyes to buildings that he felt we really couldn't afford to lose - from the grandest Tudorbethan country house to a Great Western signal box on some obscure rural branchline that would be sentenced to death by the infamous Dr Beeching in the early 60s.</p> <p>There were those who found Betjeman's stance ill-considered (he was called a \"vulgar Fleet Street man\" by one pompous modern architect whose buildings will never survive the test of time as well as the shortest poem by the future \"nation's teddy bear\"); they tended to believe that proper architecture had come to an end in the 1830s and had only begun again in England in the 1930s.</p> <p>Further back, in the 18th century, the Georgians found the great cathedrals of their medieval predecessors either \"gloomy piles\" - as, for example, Tobias Smollet's Humphrey Clinker did on his fictional travels through England - or simply rather amusing. They scratched their initials into the lovingly-carved stones and watched, very often, as the glories of old Catholic England fell into a state of romantic decay.</p> <p>So the story goes back. And back. When the Romans came to England, they were rightly fascinated by Stonehenge. They did, as far as we know, no damage to it. Perhaps they listed it, scheduled it for preservation. This we don't know. What we do know is that, since the second world war, the English - and for that matter the British in general - have become quite obsessive about preserving their built heritage and, unlike previous generations, possess a largely uncritical view of the buildings of the past. Here's the opposite of what might be the New Labour mantra \"new good, old bad\": \"old good, new bad\".</p> <p>Why? For many reasons, but not simply because so many new buildings of the 50s and 60s appeared to be so very aggressive and oblivious to their surroundings. One other reason is that the Blitz and later assaults on English towns and cities by V1 and V2 \"revenge weapons\" destroyed so much of the matter and character of the places we knew as home and as quintessentially English, that we learned - not always in time and in the teeth of opposition from opportunistic architects, insensitive planners, over-ambitious or just plain corrupt local politicians - to cling to the wreckage and to save, at first, the best of the buildings falling around us, and then every old building we could. Between 1940 and 1970, there had simply been too much destruction. While we could accept, and even enjoy, the obvious comforts and benefits of the post-war world - the NHS, holidays abroad, cars, refrigerators, central heating, radiograms and frozen fish fingers - we couldn't accept what was fast becoming the wholesale destruction of the backdrop to the everyday drama of our lives: a handsome Georgian terrace here, a heaven-seeking Victorian church there.</p> <p>Once we'd got to grips with looking after country houses and wobbly old churches lost in fields of foxgloves, bit by bit we began to want to protect the architecture that serves us everyday in simple yet endearing ways - a railway station, working men's cottages, a railway works such as that at Swindon. What had begun as an elite mission to save a passing world of grand old values - in the spirit of Evelyn Waugh deploring the fate of the great English country house in Brideshead Revisited - descended from Parnassus to the marketplace. By the 80s, and certainly by the time the Prince of Wales launched his attack on modern architecture in a speech delivered to members of the Royal Institute of British Architects at Hampton Court Palace in 1984, England had become the most comprehensively listed and architecturally pickled country in the world.</p> <p>Where once conservation battles had been championed by the likes of Betjeman and fought by a slowly growing number of well-connected pressure groups - the Georgian Group, the Victorian Society - now local groups up and down the country battled to save the most obscure old building. But not only old. The destruction of England's architectural fabric - at first by the Luftwaffe and then by holier-than-thou (and sometimes plain unholy) alliances of architects, planners, developers and local politicians - eventually shocked the majority of thinking people into wanting to preserve what was left of their heritage. It wasn't long, however, before discrimination appeared to go through the window, and obscure local interest groups were campaigning to preserve every last building that was more than 50 years old.</p> <p>It is simply not true that every old building is of historic and architectural interest. Many Victorian buildings, in fact -including most of the dull, red-brick ranks of terraced houses in which the great new middle classes choose to live around the inner belt of our towns and cities - are as dull as a Morris Marina. Yet, just as you will find a Morris Marina owners' club in England as surely as you will find a McDonald's on every high street, so, sooner or later, you will come across a local society bustling with keen people, many retired with time on their hands and far too bright to sit around watching telly or murdering the lawn for the fifth time that week, who wish to conserve a rather dreary building. This may well have been a hack job in its day and despised by anyone with taste, but that is not the point. The point is that there are people with enough spare time to bother with such old buildings; people that mistrust the new, believing contemporary architects are most likely to design something worse, and that, in their view, we can ill afford to lose historic buildings when, thanks to ill-thought-through government policy, builders are invading our green belts and farmland with cynical new houses, each with a veneer of historic detailing, double-glazing and twin garage.</p> <p>More than this, perhaps, the fight for our architectural heritage is also a form of protest. Since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, England, as the rest of Britain, has been forced under the yoke by increasingly authoritarian governments. Under Thatcher, we had a nanny-knows-best state, a curious and very un-English marriage of free-market economics and domineering social control. Under her favoured successor, Tony Blair, we have witnessed an equally un-English assertion of free-market economics, together with an obsession with all things new, and increasing social control.</p> <p>Naturally, the John Bull-Boadicea spirit still alive in the breasts of the many English people prompts them, whether knowingly or not, to resist. People essentially disenfranchised by parliament for five years at a time scout for skirmishes that they can win. The classic car lobby will fight for the survival of at least enough four-star petrol to power the nation's impressive collection of old Wolseleys, Bentleys, Jags and Armstrong-Siddeleys. The railway preservation movement will fight any attempt by Railtrack to block steam trains from running on metals that rightly belong to the nation and not to shareholders; the latter are more interested in profit than they are in public service or in the sheer delight of watching the \"Duke of Gloucester\" or \"Duchess of Hamilton\" roar across Shap Fell with a 12-car Pullman special. The classic air craft lobby will fight sortie after sortie for the right to fly Sopwith and Supermarine machines over densely-packed crowds who travel for miles to old airfields to see them perform their aerial ballets.</p> <p>Much the same is true for many of those involved in the conservation of buildings. This, along with gardening, fishing, moaning, arguing with traffic wardens, self- deprecation and surfing the net has become a part and parcel of our lives. The National Trust, dedicated to the care of historic buildings and landscapes, boasts more than two million members; it is, quite simply, the largest pressure group in the country.</p> <p>Even so, there is a case for saying that although this appeases popular English sentiment, we have preserved far too many buildings. There was always a case for protecting buildings of all sorts, from castles and palaces to the tiniest chapel and most obscure farmhouse of pre-18th century England, because these are rare. Before the Industrial Revolution, England's population was quite small, and the number of buildings it needed consequently low. As many of these were poorly built, few were ever likely to survive. We treasure those that have lasted through to our own times. By the end of the 18th century, new buildings were rising to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding and exponentially wealthy country. This social and economic revolution happened to coincide with an age of sophisticated and universally accepted taste in architecture. It really is hard to find an ugly or unlikeable building from the period between 1660 and 1830. Today, although not without a supreme effort by the conservation lobby over 75 years, we tend to revere what we know loosely as Georgian architecture and wish no more to be pulled down to make way for yet another multiplex cinema, shopping mall or postmodern-style office block.</p> <p>While we might approve of an intelligent new building, we feel in our bones - quite rightly - that the old and undistinguished is most likely to be replaced by the new and trashy, especially if there is a fast buck to be turned. When we get to the 19th and 20th centuries, however, we really have got carried away. The Victorians built a lot of horrid architecture alongside the fairytale wonders of Pugin, Burges, Butterfield and Co. In the second half of the 20th century, we built cubic acres of brutally and often cynically \"func tional\" buildings that have proved to be anything but. Many deserve to be demolished.</p> <p>Yet, even here, conservationists insist on fighting to conserve the most meretricious buildings. The very tweedy chaps and chapesses who once loathed any building raised after 1918 have, from the 1980s, battled to protect grim office blocks and sad shopping centres. This building here is a rare work - members of bodies such as the Twentieth Century Society will bark - of RSJ Gasket (1892-1978), the little-known architect who designed the Co-Op distribution centre at Neasden Lane, 1934. A plan, section and at least one elevation of the scheme, adapted from a rejected 1924 project for a miners' hostel in Prague by an unpromising pupil of Erich Mendelsohn, appeared on page 94 of the Architect's Journal (14.7.33). This is an important work. It must be listed.</p> <p>This office, over here, is an extremely rare example of the CRASS (Constructions Raised At Startling Speed) method of system-build, asbestos-lined design. Dating from 1964-67, it was a \"paradigmatic\" work by the Radical Design Unit (Quentin Lisp, Gawaine de Stamp, Letitia Hangeron and Jim Stalin). An exhibition of the original scheme has been held recently at the Architectural Association, Bedford Square, curated by the husband-and-wife team Laura and Tobias Truste-ffund, senior partners of Ugh! whose latest \"ironic\" cyber-bar and art space, Koolhaas, in happening south Kentish Town, recently featured in an eight-page Blueprint exclusive. By the time they retire to a converted barn on the north Norfolk coast, Laura and Tobias will be prominent members of the local listed-buildings committee of English Heritage. And here's another... no, that's enough.</p> <p>Many of the most delightful of all historic buildings, however - save those which are a pure aesthetic law unto themselves: Salisbury Cathedral, the Mausoleum at Castle Howard, Arnos Grove tube station - are products of change, accretion and even partial demolition. We thrill to the way our finest old cathedrals, the purity of Salisbury aside, are composed of different styles and elements, a Norman arcade here, a decorated Gothic chancel there. We like the way our best cities are not over-preserved, but restlessly alive. There is far greater pleasure to he had coming across, say, Hawksmoor's pugnacious baroque church of St Mary Woolnoth in the City of London hemmed in by grandiose Victorian, Edwardian and modern counting houses than yet another perfectly preserved Georgian house in its prim (no dogs, in a country house?) and proper National Trust grounds. As in so many areas of our lives, it's the mix, the contradictions, the unlikely and the unexpected that we thrill to. Life is not much fun when too ordered or deliberately sheltered.</p> <p>Conservation has got a little out of hand, yet until governments, architects, advertising agencies and other bodies responsible for trying to reshape our lives stop banging on about how everything new is better than everything old, the English will dig in their heels and hold the forces of overt modernism at bay. We say we like gentle change, even though England is changing at a faster pace than at any time since the brutal birth pangs of the Industrial Revolution. For better or worse, listed buildings - all 360,000 of them - are increasingly the havens we retreat to when the pace of change seems too fast</p> <p>\u0095 More information on <a href=\"http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk  \" target=\"_NEW\">www.imagesofengland.org.uk</a></p>",

There were those who found Betjeman's stance ill-considered (he was called a \"vulgar Fleet Street man\" by one pompous modern architect whose buildings will never survive the test of time as well as the shortest poem by the future \"nation's teddy bear\"); they tended to believe that proper architecture had come to an end in the 1830s and had only begun again in England in the 1930s.

Where once conservation battles had been championed by the likes of Betjeman and fought by a slowly growing number of well-connected pressure groups - the Georgian Group, the Victorian Society - now local groups up and down the country battled to save the most obscure old building. But not only old. The destruction of England's architectural fabric - at first by the Luftwaffe and then by holier-than-thou (and sometimes plain unholy) alliances of architects, planners, developers and local politicians - eventually shocked the majority of thinking people into wanting to preserve what was left of their heritage. It wasn't long, however, before discrimination appeared to go through the window, and obscure local interest groups were campaigning to preserve every last building that was more than 50 years old. It is simply not true that every old building is of historic and architectural interest. Many Victorian buildings, in fact -including most of the dull, red-brick ranks of terraced houses in which the great new middle classes choose to live around the inner belt of our towns and cities - are as dull as a Morris Marina. Yet, just as you will find a Morris Marina owners' club in England as surely as you will find a McDonald's on every high street, so, sooner or later, you will come across a local society bustling with keen people, many retired with time on their hands and far too bright to sit around watching telly or murdering the lawn for the fifth time that week, who wish to conserve a rather dreary building. This may well have been a hack job in its day and despised by anyone with taste, but that is not the point. The point is that there are people with enough spare time to bother with such old buildings; people that mistrust the new, believing contemporary architects are most likely to design something worse, and that, in their view, we can ill afford to lose historic buildings when, thanks to ill-thought-through government policy, builders are invading our green belts and farmland with cynical new houses, each with a veneer of historic detailing, double-glazing and twin garage. More than this, perhaps, the fight for our architectural heritage is also a form of protest. Since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, England, as the rest of Britain, has been forced under the yoke by increasingly authoritarian governments. Under Thatcher, we had a nanny-knows-best state, a curious and very un-English marriage of free-market economics and domineering social control. Under her favoured successor, Tony Blair, we have witnessed an equally un-English assertion of free-market economics, together with an obsession with all things new, and increasing social control. Naturally, the John Bull-Boadicea spirit still alive in the breasts of the many English people prompts them, whether knowingly or not, to resist. People essentially disenfranchised by parliament for five years at a time scout for skirmishes that they can win. The classic car lobby will fight for the survival of at least enough four-star petrol to power the nation's impressive collection of old Wolseleys, Bentleys, Jags and Armstrong-Siddeleys. The railway preservation movement will fight any attempt by Railtrack to block steam trains from running on metals that rightly belong to the nation and not to shareholders; the latter are more interested in profit than they are in public service or in the sheer delight of watching the \"Duke of Gloucester\" or \"Duchess of Hamilton\" roar across Shap Fell with a 12-car Pullman special. The classic air craft lobby will fight sortie after sortie for the right to fly Sopwith and Supermarine machines over densely-packed crowds who travel for miles to old airfields to see them perform their aerial ballets. Much the same is true for many of those involved in the conservation of buildings. This, along with gardening, fishing, moaning, arguing with traffic wardens, self- deprecation and surfing the net has become a part and parcel of our lives. The National Trust, dedicated to the care of historic buildings and landscapes, boasts more than two million members; it is, quite simply, the largest pressure group in the country. Even so, there is a case for saying that although this appeases popular English sentiment, we have preserved far too many buildings. There was always a case for protecting buildings of all sorts, from castles and palaces to the tiniest chapel and most obscure farmhouse of pre-18th century England, because these are rare. Before the Industrial Revolution, England's population was quite small, and the number of buildings it needed consequently low. As many of these were poorly built, few were ever likely to survive. We treasure those that have lasted through to our own times. By the end of the 18th century, new buildings were rising to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding and exponentially wealthy country. This social and economic revolution happened to coincide with an age of sophisticated and universally accepted taste in architecture. It really is hard to find an ugly or unlikeable building from the period between 1660 and 1830. Today, although not without a supreme effort by the conservation lobby over 75 years, we tend to revere what we know loosely as Georgian architecture and wish no more to be pulled down to make way for yet another multiplex cinema, shopping mall or postmodern-style office block. While we might approve of an intelligent new building, we feel in our bones - quite rightly - that the old and undistinguished is most likely to be replaced by the new and trashy, especially if there is a fast buck to be turned. When we get to the 19th and 20th centuries, however, we really have got carried away. The Victorians built a lot of horrid architecture alongside the fairytale wonders of Pugin, Burges, Butterfield and Co. In the second half of the 20th century, we built cubic acres of brutally and often cynically \"func tional\" buildings that have proved to be anything but. Many deserve to be demolished. Yet, even here, conservationists insist on fighting to conserve the most meretricious buildings. The very tweedy chaps and chapesses who once loathed any building raised after 1918 have, from the 1980s, battled to protect grim office blocks and sad shopping centres. This building here is a rare work - members of bodies such as the Twentieth Century Society will bark - of RSJ Gasket (1892-1978), the little-known architect who designed the Co-Op distribution centre at Neasden Lane, 1934. A plan, section and at least one elevation of the scheme, adapted from a rejected 1924 project for a miners' hostel in Prague by an unpromising pupil of Erich Mendelsohn, appeared on page 94 of the Architect's Journal (14.7.33). This is an important work. It must be listed. This office, over here, is an extremely rare example of the CRASS (Constructions Raised At Startling Speed) method of system-build, asbestos-lined design. Dating from 1964-67, it was a \"paradigmatic\" work by the Radical Design Unit (Quentin Lisp, Gawaine de Stamp, Letitia Hangeron and Jim Stalin). An exhibition of the original scheme has been held recently at the Architectural Association, Bedford Square, curated by the husband-and-wife team Laura and Tobias Truste-ffund, senior partners of Ugh! whose latest \"ironic\" cyber-bar and art space, Koolhaas, in happening south Kentish Town, recently featured in an eight-page Blueprint exclusive. By the time they retire to a converted barn on the north Norfolk coast, Laura and Tobias will be prominent members of the local listed-buildings committee of English Heritage. And here's another... no, that's enough. Many of the most delightful of all historic buildings, however - save those which are a pure aesthetic law unto themselves: Salisbury Cathedral, the Mausoleum at Castle Howard, Arnos Grove tube station - are products of change, accretion and even partial demolition. We thrill to the way our finest old cathedrals, the purity of Salisbury aside, are composed of different styles and elements, a Norman arcade here, a decorated Gothic chancel there. We like the way our best cities are not over-preserved, but restlessly alive. There is far greater pleasure to he had coming across, say, Hawksmoor's pugnacious baroque church of St Mary Woolnoth in the City of London hemmed in by grandiose Victorian, Edwardian and modern counting houses than yet another perfectly preserved Georgian house in its prim (no dogs, in a country house?) and proper National Trust grounds. As in so many areas of our lives, it's the mix, the contradictions, the unlikely and the unexpected that we thrill to. Life is not much fun when too ordered or deliberately sheltered. Conservation has got a little out of hand, yet until governments, architects, advertising agencies and other bodies responsible for trying to reshape our lives stop banging on about how everything new is better than everything old, the English will dig in their heels and hold the forces of overt modernism at bay. We say we like gentle change, even though England is changing at a faster pace than at any time since the brutal birth pangs of the Industrial Revolution. For better or worse, listed buildings - all 360,000 of them - are increasingly the havens we retreat to when the pace of change seems too fast \u0095 More information on www.imagesofengland.org.uk",

      "bodyText": "Governor Jeb Bush of Florida - whose elder brother George W Bush, the Texas governor, is battling to win the Republican presidential nomination - is pushing ahead this weekend with a controversial \"One Florida\" programme which aims to eliminate affirmative action programmes from a state where one in four inhabitants is black or Latino. The programme is likely to be passed on Tuesday, after the Florida board of regents - which controls the state's university system in which 35% of the 219,000 students are from minorities - voted by 12-0 this week to approve it. Most political observers had assumed Jeb Bush's public role this year would be to keep his head down and avoid jeopardising his brother's campaign. But if that was the strategy, it has failed, as the Florida governor's plan has provoked protests and sit-ins across the state, and led one black minister to equate him with Hitler. The One Florida plan gives Mr Bush executive power to end race-based admissions to all Florida's state-run colleges and universities. It scraps the state's system of race-based preferences in the award of public sector contracts. Similar moves to end affirmative action have already taken place in Texas, California and Washington state. Mr Bush's plan was announced last November in an attempt to ward off efforts by affirmative action opponents to submit the issue to a state-wide referendum this year - a vote that would undoubtedly polarise the Florida electorate on racial grounds and would happen on the day that George W Bush hopes to be on the ballot in the presidential election. Jeb Bush's plan includes safeguards designed to draw the sting of abolition. He guaranteed that all 18-year-old school leavers who finished in the top 20% of their class could go to college. This week, to safeguard minority businesses, he proposed a statewide system of registration and regular monitoring. \"This is not the end of affirmative action.

      "bodyText": "It should have been a shoe-in for the might of Disney's The Lion King, but the National Theatre upset the form book yesterday by sweeping the Olivier Awards. Trevor Nunn and his experimental ensemble of actors, including Patricia Hodge and Simon Russell Beale, took nine awards and gave critics who branded his regime \"conservative and unimaginative\" something to think about. His evening was crowned when he won best director for three plays at the National. \"The ensemble has been wonderful,\" he said. \"I've never had so much fun in rehearsals.\" The National even showed the West End how it should be done by winning the best musical and best new musical for Leonard Bernstein's Candide and Honk! The Ugly Duckling. The Lion King, which had been tipped to sweep the board, won just two awards, for best choreographer and costume designer. Even the triumphant writing team behind Honk! was surprised at the turnaround. \"I guess the judges couldn't get tickets for The Lion King,\" said composer George Stiles. There was disappointment too for Spend, Spend, Spend, the hit musical about the pools winner Viv Nicholson. It took just two awards, including one for Barbara Dickson as best actress in a musical. The most rapturous ovation was saved for Peter O'Toole, 67, who picked up the outstanding achievement award from Lord Olivier's widow, Joan Plowright, for his performance in Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell. Aware that there might be the faint sound of spinning underground, O'Toole admitted that he and Laurence Olivier were not exactly soulmates. \"We shared a dressing room for Hamlet at the Old Vic and we hit a few snags. \"I was not speechlessly happy about his positioning of the shower. And Larry was less than ecstatic about where I kept the Guinness. I kept the Guinness in the shower.\" Who won what at the Oliviers Best actress Janie Dee for Comic Potential at the Lyric Best actor Henry Goodman for The Merchant Of Venice at the National Theatre Outstanding musical production Candide at the National Outstanding achievement award Peter O'Toole for his role as Jeffrey Bernard in Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell Best supporting actor Roger Allam for Money at the National Best supporting actress Patricia Hodge for Money Best director Trevor Nunn for Summerfolk, The Merchant of Venice, and Troilus and Cressida, all at the National Best new musical Honk!

That society has required the police officers to take risks on our behalf. I have subjected them to three weeks' sustained attack without the protection afforded by the criminal court, with no pretence of natural justice and there is nothing that I can do about it. The need to change the law to prevent this is to me overwhelming.\"</p> <p>Earlier Dr Burton had angered Michael Mansfield, counsel for O'Neill's family, by telling the jury that a verdict of unlawful killing would make the IRA member seem a martyr and might suggest the bombing campaign he was helping to mastermind was justified.</p> <p>O'Neill was shot when officer Kilo ran into room 303 of the Glenthorne Road hotel in Hammersmith, west London, on September 23, 1996.</p> <p>The raid followed a three month surveillance operation on a suspected IRA cell following bombings at Canary Wharf and in Manchester. The SO19 team had discovered six tons of explosives, detonators, and AK47 assault rifles in north London and believed another attack was imminent.</p> <p>A bugging device was placed in O'Neill's car and the jury, sitting at Kingston crown court, heard him telling an accomplice that any police officer who confronted him would have to be killed.</p> <p>The hotel raid, however, was a disaster. A duplicate room key did not work and an electronically powered ram battered a hole through the door without opening it, ruining the element of surprise. Ten rounds of CS gas were thrown into the room making it difficult to see.</p> <p>Officer Kilo denied he had shot O'Neill out of panic. \"Through the smoke I saw a figure by the door. I screamed 'show me your hands'. I didn't have good vision. The figure didn't move and said nothing. I couldn't see his hands. I feared for my life.\"</p> <p>O'Neill's father, Eoghan, said he would consider appealing against the verdict, or seek a public inquiry. \"The police have got away lightly. They were deaf, blind and dumb. They should never have gone in there with the gas.\"</p> <p>Sinn Fein policing spokes-man Gerry Kelly said the decision did not surprise anyone in Ireland. \"There is no expectation that Irish people alive or dead can achieve justice in British courts.,\"</p> <p>The head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, said he would review the way specialist operations are conducted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An unarmed IRA quartermaster who was shot six times in a hotel room by a police officer was lawfully killed even though the raid by a specialist firearms unit had gone \"badly wrong\", a coroner's jury ruled yesterday. The decision was condemned by Sinn Fein and the family of the victim, Diarmuid O'Neill, who died in a hail of bullets fired through a cloud of CS gas by an officer codenamed \"Kilo\". Giving evidence from behind a screen, the officer, who worked for Scotland Yard's SO19 unit, said he thought O'Neill, 27, had a weapon and intended to kill him. Following the verdict, the coroner John Burton said he was unhappy at the way the three week inquest had been conducted. \"This is a democratic society. That society has required the police officers to take risks on our behalf. I have subjected them to three weeks' sustained attack without the protection afforded by the criminal court, with no pretence of natural justice and there is nothing that I can do about it. The need to change the law to prevent this is to me overwhelming.\" Earlier Dr Burton had angered Michael Mansfield, counsel for O'Neill's family, by telling the jury that a verdict of unlawful killing would make the IRA member seem a martyr and might suggest the bombing campaign he was helping to mastermind was justified. O'Neill was shot when officer Kilo ran into room 303 of the Glenthorne Road hotel in Hammersmith, west London, on September 23, 1996. The raid followed a three month surveillance operation on a suspected IRA cell following bombings at Canary Wharf and in Manchester. The SO19 team had discovered six tons of explosives, detonators, and AK47 assault rifles in north London and believed another attack was imminent. A bugging device was placed in O'Neill's car and the jury, sitting at Kingston crown court, heard him telling an accomplice that any police officer who confronted him would have to be killed. The hotel raid, however, was a disaster. A duplicate room key did not work and an electronically powered ram battered a hole through the door without opening it, ruining the element of surprise. Ten rounds of CS gas were thrown into the room making it difficult to see. Officer Kilo denied he had shot O'Neill out of panic. \"Through the smoke I saw a figure by the door. I screamed 'show me your hands'. I didn't have good vision. The figure didn't move and said nothing. I couldn't see his hands. I feared for my life.\" O'Neill's father, Eoghan, said he would consider appealing against the verdict, or seek a public inquiry. \"The police have got away lightly. They were deaf, blind and dumb. They should never have gone in there with the gas.\" Sinn Fein policing spokes-man Gerry Kelly said the decision did not surprise anyone in Ireland. \"There is no expectation that Irish people alive or dead can achieve justice in British courts.,\" The head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, said he would review the way specialist operations are conducted.",

A spokesman for the department of culture, media and sport said that talks were under way involving all museums, not just the Science Museum. The minister would make an announcement about \"further steps to increase free access to museums\" before the end of March, he said. But nothing could be settled until the government had agreed with customs and excise on museums' VAT status. After that, it would be up to the museums themselves to decide whether they wanted to charge admission or not.",

      "body": "<p>Between my first kiss and my first A level there came Trotsky. I am sure I would have met him sooner or later, plastered against the wall in a student union bar or on a street corner hiding behind a petition. But he came to me on a sunny day in Hyde Park. It was 1984; the year of the miners' strike, the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, and Ronald Reagan's victory in the US presidential elections. I was 15 - a self-important teenage vegetarian who felt that all was not quite right with the world.</p> <p> I had spent most of the day wondering around London with a Socialist Workers Party banner for company, protesting against the visit of the South African president, PW Botha. I had been avoiding the eyes of paper sellers and policemen, when a young man with acne caught me unawares and offered me a copy of Young Socialist. I bought it, read it in less than five minutes - all the articles were basically the same \"Thatcher is horrible, miners are great, socialism is even better\" - and thought little more about it. </p> <p>A few weeks later I pulled the paper from the bottom of my bag, wrote to the editor and asked if I could join the revolution with much the same degree of forethought as others in my peer group applied to join fan clubs. I was bored. It was something to do. And there would probably be girls there too, so, who knows, I might even come by a second kiss.</p> <p> Given the range of anti-social behaviour available to a hormonally besieged adolescent, there were worse things I could have turned my attentions to than the overthrow of capitalism. I would be lying if I said that I was aware of precisely what I was getting into. I knew I was joining some kind of socialist outfit. I suspected it was the younger section of the Labour Party - as it happened it was the youth wing of the Workers Revolutionary Party. This was not a problem for me. After all, if you're going to go into politics at that age you might as well get some cred and join something nobody's ever heard of. </p> <p>When I discovered they were Trotskyists this did not bother me much either. I didn't really know what Trotskyism was. I scarcely knew who Trotsky was. The leader of the Red Army who had been ousted and later executed in exile by Stalin had, it turned out, left a legacy for those who supported socialism but could not stomach the Soviet Union. I knew him better as Snowball from George Orwell's Animal Farm. </p> <p> In my naivety I presumed that, since socialism was underpinned by the notion of solidarity, those who believed in it would club together - especially given that they were relatively small in number. I didn't know at the time that there were at least 57 varieties of hard-left party, some with less than 57 members in total. How could I know that there was a significant difference between the Revolutionary Communist League of Britain (RCLB - Maoist) and the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain Marxist-Leninist (RCPGBM-L - pro-Albanian)? In short, I didn't know very much. But then I didn't have to.</p> <p> The WRP credo was fairly straightforward. Britain in 1984, they believed, was more or less at the same stage as Russia in 1916 - a nation on the brink of revolution. All that was needed to push it over the edge was a general strike. If we could get everyone out together, we could bring the nation to a standstill, form some soviets, replace the police with a workers militia and then Bingo! - capitalism would be dead before you could say Fourth International. </p> <p> The simplicity of the thesis was a great source of comfort. The party was providing such a comprehensive and unwavering world view that I felt I would never have to work out anything again. It provided a reason for everything that was bad - from the famine in Ethiopia to racist policing - about capitalism. For every problem there was only one solution - revolution. Every issue could be shoehorned into this single transferable analysis, it seemed. </p> <p> Concerns with details of policy, from taxation to nuclear disarmament, were little more than micromanaging. This sense of self-confidence, bolstered by a similar lack of self-knowledge, lent a distinctly cult-like air to the entire enterprise which, as is the way with cults, I only really became aware of when I'd left. Moreover, the party's uncompromising and often unreasonable stance on most issues dovetailed neatly with the petulant, know-all stage I was going through. If adults ever hit me with the phrase: \"You think you've got the answers to everything don't you?\" I would think, but never say: \"I do actually. Seizing state power from the bourgeoisie and placing it in the hands of the working class as the first step towards a more just world.\" </p> <p>I actually pitied those who missed the big picture. I lamented the wasted lives of all the adults who tried to work out their views on individual issues on a case-to-case basis. They were playing dot-to-dot; I had the huge, broad brush. And I was clearly not alone in this. My guess is that there were about 2,000 members, including high-profile actors such as Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour. </p> <p>The two main leaders were a Sri Lankan called Mike Banda and a Londoner, Gerry Healy. Their arrival at the microphone during meetings was always met with reverent hush that went beyond the demands of average party discipline. I remember little about Banda's speaking style, but Healy's was unmistakeable. He would shout and scream into the microphone, ranting fluent gibberish. And as he prodded the air with his little finger, his face would get redder and redder until his entire bald head was a small, round pate of scarlet. </p> <p> Commitment to the party was total. If Britain was about to explode into revolution then it followed that a revolutionary party had to be ready and waiting in the wings. And if the party was to be ready then its members had to be at battle stations at all times, with no excuses and definitely no time off for good behaviour.

I had a purpose in my life that felt both beyond and above school and parents. Raised under the strictures of Caribbean matriarchy, I felt little need for more discipline in my life but I welcomed my first dalliance with a tradition possessing its own flag (red) and its own anthem (The Internationale). And it was exciting too. </p> <p>Unusually for the hard left, its youth base was greater among the working class than among students. While there was a general tone of seriousness that affected everyone in the party, life in the Young Socialists - most, on average, only a few years older than me - was a rowdy kind of fun. Not only did it provide an instant group of friends but also a limitless amount of things to do with them. We went to the picket lines in Nottingham, to conference in Blackpool and countless demonstrations in London, all of which meant coach trips and the underage beer-drinking and snogging that went with them. </p> <p> The older members, however, were apparently a different story. The demands of party work undoubtedly played havoc with their personal lives. A mixture of teachers, council workers and actors, they were, for the most part, a humourless bunch of drones who wore a harried and haggard look which suggested that Armaggedon, not revolution, was just around the corner. They were socially disabled - incapable of talking about anything else but the party because they had long since shut everything else out of their lives. </p> <p>The fact that nobody else wanted a general strike not only confirmed our cult status, it gave us a messianic edge. Our detractors were either capitalist lackeys - like the TUC - or just plain chicken, like the Communist party, which did actually want a general strike, but only for 24 hours. Thanks to our superior analysis, we were in the possession of a valuable and exclusive truth - the world, as we knew it, was about to end. </p> <p>However implausible this may seem now, it did not strike me as a completely unreasonable proposition then. Where class conflict is concerned, 1984 was a spectacular year. With bloody pitched battles between the police and pickets at Orgreave, courts sequestrating union assets, bailiffs removing Greenham Common protesters and showdowns brewing between leftwing councils and the government over rate-capping, the idea that parliamentary democracy was in crisis and preferred foul means rather than fair to crush dissent did not seem a fanciful one. </p> <p>Nor did it seem odd to suggest that, if the miners were going to win, they were going to need the help of other unions. But then I was at infants' school when the miners brought down a Conservative government and had not yet been born when students brought central London to a standstill over Vietnam. I had no idea that I was witnessing a violent but regular episode of the never-ending bump and grind between labour and capital. I would soon learn that, while 1984 may have been spectacular, it was by no means exceptional. </p> <p>It was nothing like Russia in 1916. For the following year saw not revolutionary upheaval but the biggest defeat the British working class had suffered in over half a century. And by the time the miners went back to work, my revolutionary career was already winding to a close. I can trace the beginning of its demise to a meeting in the party headquarters in Clapham. A red-faced Healy was raging on at the top of his voice and I was watching the clock. I had told my mum I would be back by 6pm. It was already five, I was an hour and a half from home and Healy had only just started. </p> <p> He finally wound up an hour later and, as I made for the door, a burly man stopped me and told me they weren't letting anyone out during the interval. I explained the situation, but he wouldn't budge. I asked if I could just go out and call home and tell my mum where I was. \"The phones around here are bugged, comrade,\" he said sternly. </p> <p>\"I don't give a shit if they find out that I'm going to be late home,\" I said. But the doorman was not for moving. I got back at 10pm in tears and in trouble. A few weeks later I went on a weekend school trip to Howarth as part of my A-level English syllabus on Wuthering Heights. When I returned, my mother, who had just about had it with the revolution by this time, told me that the party had been ringing constantly. I called the WRP organiser and received a vicious tongue-lashing. </p> <p>\"You can't just piss off to Yorkshire without telling anyone,\" he screamed. \"Don't you know that the state are picking people up left, right and centre at a time of crisis like this?\" \"Like who?\" I asked. \"Never mind who,\" he shouted, and then delivered a stern lecture on party discipline. By this stage I had had enough. The miners were trickling back to work, the revolution was clearly not around the corner and I was sick of grown-ups playing soldiers. The security blanket of intellectual certainty I had felt when I had joined no longer comforted me. Any suggestion that there was more to politics than class struggle - like race and gender - was met with fierce rebuke. </p> <p> I was 16 and had already outgrown the revolution. When I did turn up I started to feel harassed. When I refused to go paper-selling one weekend I was accused of being an MI5 agent; when I expressed a casual interest in Fidel Castro I was told that I only liked him because he was black. I started making excuses for not going to meetings and concentrated more on my school work instead. I had been taking an evening course in French and had entered myself for A-levels. I told the WRP that I would need some time off party work for revision. My request was refused. That was the final straw. </p> <p>I knew that if I didn't intervene at this stage my mother would, and I would rather have taken on the self-appointed representatives of the working class than her any day. I called when I knew the local organiser would be out and told his flatmate I was leaving the party. I didn't sleep that night, so tortured was I by the portentousness of my actions. The next day he came round and lectured me again on party discipline.</p> <p> Revolutions don't come without hard work, and hard work needed sacrifice, he said. He sounded like a clergyman trying to save a marriage. But he might as well have been talking to the stack of pamphlets that was always sitting in his car. My mind was made up. \"I'm leaving,\" I told him. \"Nobody leaves this party, Gary,\" he said. \"They either get kicked out or they die.\" Given that I am still here to tell the tale, I can only presume that I was expelled in my absence. I had as few qualms about leaving as I did about joining. My nine months in the WRP were a great political and personal education. </p> <p>In time I would learn the damage of dogma, the power of rhetoric and the fact that politics is not just an extracurricular activity. I discovered that, when it came to debate, shades of grey suited me better than black and white, but that complexity should never be used as an excuse for inaction. And while I never joined a Trotskyist party again, my experience did not leave me with a vitriolic disdain for Trotskyists - although I do think that Trotsky himself would be rather disappointed by many of those who struggle in his name. </p> <p>In any case, five months after I was \"kicked out\", Healy would suffer the same fate. Accused by Banda of \"cruel and systematic debauchery\" after abusing his influence to coerce younger, female party members into bed, and secretly buying himself a \u00a315,000 BMW with party funds, his expulsion made \"Reds in the bed\" tabloid headlines. Banda's attack coincided with a 180-degree shift in the party's politics, towards Labour under Neil Kinnock. The Redgraves sided with Healy and split to form a separate group, the Marxist party. The hard left had just sprouted a 58th variety. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Between my first kiss and my first A level there came Trotsky. I am sure I would have met him sooner or later, plastered against the wall in a student union bar or on a street corner hiding behind a petition. But he came to me on a sunny day in Hyde Park. It was 1984; the year of the miners' strike, the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, and Ronald Reagan's victory in the US presidential elections. I was 15 - a self-important teenage vegetarian who felt that all was not quite right with the world. I had spent most of the day wondering around London with a Socialist Workers Party banner for company, protesting against the visit of the South African president, PW Botha. I had been avoiding the eyes of paper sellers and policemen, when a young man with acne caught me unawares and offered me a copy of Young Socialist. I bought it, read it in less than five minutes - all the articles were basically the same \"Thatcher is horrible, miners are great, socialism is even better\" - and thought little more about it. A few weeks later I pulled the paper from the bottom of my bag, wrote to the editor and asked if I could join the revolution with much the same degree of forethought as others in my peer group applied to join fan clubs. I was bored. It was something to do. And there would probably be girls there too, so, who knows, I might even come by a second kiss. Given the range of anti-social behaviour available to a hormonally besieged adolescent, there were worse things I could have turned my attentions to than the overthrow of capitalism. I would be lying if I said that I was aware of precisely what I was getting into. I knew I was joining some kind of socialist outfit. I suspected it was the younger section of the Labour Party - as it happened it was the youth wing of the Workers Revolutionary Party. This was not a problem for me. After all, if you're going to go into politics at that age you might as well get some cred and join something nobody's ever heard of. When I discovered they were Trotskyists this did not bother me much either. I didn't really know what Trotskyism was. I scarcely knew who Trotsky was. The leader of the Red Army who had been ousted and later executed in exile by Stalin had, it turned out, left a legacy for those who supported socialism but could not stomach the Soviet Union. I knew him better as Snowball from George Orwell's Animal Farm. In my naivety I presumed that, since socialism was underpinned by the notion of solidarity, those who believed in it would club together - especially given that they were relatively small in number. I didn't know at the time that there were at least 57 varieties of hard-left party, some with less than 57 members in total. How could I know that there was a significant difference between the Revolutionary Communist League of Britain (RCLB - Maoist) and the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain Marxist-Leninist (RCPGBM-L - pro-Albanian)? In short, I didn't know very much. But then I didn't have to. The WRP credo was fairly straightforward. Britain in 1984, they believed, was more or less at the same stage as Russia in 1916 - a nation on the brink of revolution. All that was needed to push it over the edge was a general strike. If we could get everyone out together, we could bring the nation to a standstill, form some soviets, replace the police with a workers militia and then Bingo! - capitalism would be dead before you could say Fourth International. The simplicity of the thesis was a great source of comfort. The party was providing such a comprehensive and unwavering world view that I felt I would never have to work out anything again. It provided a reason for everything that was bad - from the famine in Ethiopia to racist policing - about capitalism. For every problem there was only one solution - revolution. Every issue could be shoehorned into this single transferable analysis, it seemed. Concerns with details of policy, from taxation to nuclear disarmament, were little more than micromanaging. This sense of self-confidence, bolstered by a similar lack of self-knowledge, lent a distinctly cult-like air to the entire enterprise which, as is the way with cults, I only really became aware of when I'd left. Moreover, the party's uncompromising and often unreasonable stance on most issues dovetailed neatly with the petulant, know-all stage I was going through. If adults ever hit me with the phrase: \"You think you've got the answers to everything don't you?\" I would think, but never say: \"I do actually. Seizing state power from the bourgeoisie and placing it in the hands of the working class as the first step towards a more just world.\" I actually pitied those who missed the big picture. I lamented the wasted lives of all the adults who tried to work out their views on individual issues on a case-to-case basis. They were playing dot-to-dot; I had the huge, broad brush. And I was clearly not alone in this. My guess is that there were about 2,000 members, including high-profile actors such as Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour. The two main leaders were a Sri Lankan called Mike Banda and a Londoner, Gerry Healy. Their arrival at the microphone during meetings was always met with reverent hush that went beyond the demands of average party discipline. I remember little about Banda's speaking style, but Healy's was unmistakeable. He would shout and scream into the microphone, ranting fluent gibberish. And as he prodded the air with his little finger, his face would get redder and redder until his entire bald head was a small, round pate of scarlet. Commitment to the party was total. If Britain was about to explode into revolution then it followed that a revolutionary party had to be ready and waiting in the wings. And if the party was to be ready then its members had to be at battle stations at all times, with no excuses and definitely no time off for good behaviour. It meant that everything - births, deaths, marriages, exams, you name it - had to take second place to the preparations under way for the glorious and imminent day when we would not so much inherit the earth as nationalise it, collectivise it and then forbid anyone from inheriting anything ever again. \"The needs of the individual must be subordinated to the needs of the party,\" chimed the mantra. And it was observed religiously. I spent about three nights a week and at least half the weekend selling papers, attending meetings and organising events. No birthday, no party, no football match could compete with the demands of the revolution; you simply did not blow out workers' power for a disco or a date.

From their days in the Slade art school to the desolate end of her short life, Augustus insisted that they include Gwen in their exhibitions, admire her spare little drawings, her oils of cats and girls as wan and bony as herself, even buy them. </p> <p>Once Augustus roared that Gwen was the greater artist and one day everyone would recognise it. How pleased he would have been if this had happened is a moot point. It is a source of extreme irritation to Angus Stewart, who is curating the largest exhibition of Gwen's work since the Barbican in 1985 - over 100 works will be shown in London at the Spring Olympia antiques fair - that the two are measured against one another. </p> <p>\"It's degrading to any woman only to see her in the context of a man in her life, but it is a particularly wrong way to view Gwen John. She is singular, of herself,\" he says. At the same time, he concedes that without being lit by the blaze of Augustus, Gwen would have vanished into the darkness. </p> <p>Most of the pieces for the exhibition come from private, anonymous loans. In a few cases, Stewart recognised unsigned Gwen John works whose owners did not realise what they possessed. \"It is quite possible that her name would now only be known to a handful of appreciative collectors. She is a major figure in British art, but she probably would never have been that without his reputation keeping hers alive.\" </p> <p>Life had thrown Augustus and Gwen together early. She was eight and he was six when their mother died, leaving them and two siblings with a father who was incapable of showing love. Gwen inherited his lean looks and his fierce silences. </p> <p>Augustus was the roaring boy, full of black depressions and huge glees, swaggering around Montparnasse, painting like a man possessed, trailing women and babies in his wake, leaving every home - just ahead of the bailiff - knee-deep in tattered drawings. She was thin, ascetic, shy but stubborn. The force of her personality terrified her family, friends and the few men and women with whom she fell violently, self-destructively, in love. A neighbour in Paris, Louise Roche, said: \"She treated her body as though she were its executioner.\" </p> <p>He painted vibrant portraits of the great and good, and rolled about on divans with aristocratic ladies. She painted street children and servant girls, using less and less colour, until nothing remained except foggy greys, greens and yellows. He left his flourishing signature on thousands of works, and earned (and spent) a small fortune from them. She frequently left pieces half finished or unsigned, and gave away more than she sold. </p> <p>Gwen John has been taken up by a feminist strand of art revisionism, which views women in terms of what they might have achieved had they not been hamstrung by oppressive men. The villains, in this version of her life, are Augustus John and the sculptor Rodin. She wrote literally thousands of letters to Rodin, moved home to live near him at Meudon, just outside Paris, and lived mainly in a hut near his old home for the 22 years she outlived him. He wrote her a handful of sometimes harsh letters (some are being lent for the exhibition by the Gwen John archive at the National Library of Wales), complained that her sexual demands wasted his energy, rationed her visits, used her as a model but attached a more beautiful head, and sometimes barred the door against her. Significantly, she drove the object of her last attachment, a woman Christian missionary, to almost identical attempts to restrain her. </p> <p>As part of the research for this exhibition, Stewart visited the Mus\u00e9e Rodin in Paris. They showed him a self-portrait that Gwen had given Rodin, but declined to loan it. \"It was pitiful,\" he says. \"The drawing was put away in a cupboard, unframed. It is a beautiful drawing, but she has the most abject, beseeching expression on her face. She is holding something in her hands; I believe it is one of her letters, which she is begging Rodin to accept.\" </p> <p>Stewart refuses to blame Rodin. Mostly he was patient towards her, and supportive of her work, while Gwen was obsessive and demanding. \"A stalker, that is just what she was. I do not think he was interested in her. That is not a crime.\" He thinks the damage had already been done by someone, or something, else. \"Look at the earlier self- portraits, and the early drawings of her by Augustus. She's no conventional beauty, but she's a handsome, fashionably dressed, confident young woman. The contrast with the later images of her is appalling.\" </p> <p>He thinks something happened in one of the more extraordinary episodes in her life, when Augustus's wife Ida and mistress Dorelia - originally a friend of Gwen's, and the subject of her most imposing portraits - were both tormented by the effort to live in a menage \u00e0 trois plus children. Gwen persuaded Dorelia, in 1903, to walk to Rome. They almost starved and froze, and only reached Toulouse. Dorelia came out of it more confident, and briefly broke from the charmed circle, taking a younger lover. Gwen came out of it, Stewart believes, somehow permanently damaged. </p> <p>The Gwen John show will be seen beside a collection of pots by Dame Lucie Rie, also curated by Stewart, who sees many parallels in the women's deliberate paring down of form and colour, until only an essence and a restrained but powerful sensuousness remained. </p> <p>In September 1939 Gwen decided she had to see the sea again. She took the train from Paris to Dieppe, where she collapsed in the street. She may have starved herself - she had repeatedly fasted to the point of collapse over the previous decades. Two weeks later she died in the town hospital, and was presumably buried in a pauper's grave, which is now lost. \"One cannot explain Gwen John away,\" Stewart says. \"No matter whether you think her good, bad or indifferent, there isn't anyone else like her. She is, and that's it.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Gwen John and Lucie Rie is at Spring Olympia, London W14 (0171-370 8212), from Tuesday.</p>",

Augustus was the roaring boy, full of black depressions and huge glees, swaggering around Montparnasse, painting like a man possessed, trailing women and babies in his wake, leaving every home - just ahead of the bailiff - knee-deep in tattered drawings. She was thin, ascetic, shy but stubborn. The force of her personality terrified her family, friends and the few men and women with whom she fell violently, self-destructively, in love. A neighbour in Paris, Louise Roche, said: \"She treated her body as though she were its executioner.\" He painted vibrant portraits of the great and good, and rolled about on divans with aristocratic ladies. She painted street children and servant girls, using less and less colour, until nothing remained except foggy greys, greens and yellows. He left his flourishing signature on thousands of works, and earned (and spent) a small fortune from them. She frequently left pieces half finished or unsigned, and gave away more than she sold. Gwen John has been taken up by a feminist strand of art revisionism, which views women in terms of what they might have achieved had they not been hamstrung by oppressive men. The villains, in this version of her life, are Augustus John and the sculptor Rodin. She wrote literally thousands of letters to Rodin, moved home to live near him at Meudon, just outside Paris, and lived mainly in a hut near his old home for the 22 years she outlived him. He wrote her a handful of sometimes harsh letters (some are being lent for the exhibition by the Gwen John archive at the National Library of Wales), complained that her sexual demands wasted his energy, rationed her visits, used her as a model but attached a more beautiful head, and sometimes barred the door against her. Significantly, she drove the object of her last attachment, a woman Christian missionary, to almost identical attempts to restrain her. As part of the research for this exhibition, Stewart visited the Mus\u00e9e Rodin in Paris. They showed him a self-portrait that Gwen had given Rodin, but declined to loan it. \"It was pitiful,\" he says. \"The drawing was put away in a cupboard, unframed. It is a beautiful drawing, but she has the most abject, beseeching expression on her face. She is holding something in her hands; I believe it is one of her letters, which she is begging Rodin to accept.\" Stewart refuses to blame Rodin. Mostly he was patient towards her, and supportive of her work, while Gwen was obsessive and demanding. \"A stalker, that is just what she was. I do not think he was interested in her. That is not a crime.\" He thinks the damage had already been done by someone, or something, else. \"Look at the earlier self- portraits, and the early drawings of her by Augustus. She's no conventional beauty, but she's a handsome, fashionably dressed, confident young woman. The contrast with the later images of her is appalling.\" He thinks something happened in one of the more extraordinary episodes in her life, when Augustus's wife Ida and mistress Dorelia - originally a friend of Gwen's, and the subject of her most imposing portraits - were both tormented by the effort to live in a menage \u00e0 trois plus children. Gwen persuaded Dorelia, in 1903, to walk to Rome. They almost starved and froze, and only reached Toulouse. Dorelia came out of it more confident, and briefly broke from the charmed circle, taking a younger lover. Gwen came out of it, Stewart believes, somehow permanently damaged. The Gwen John show will be seen beside a collection of pots by Dame Lucie Rie, also curated by Stewart, who sees many parallels in the women's deliberate paring down of form and colour, until only an essence and a restrained but powerful sensuousness remained. In September 1939 Gwen decided she had to see the sea again. She took the train from Paris to Dieppe, where she collapsed in the street. She may have starved herself - she had repeatedly fasted to the point of collapse over the previous decades. Two weeks later she died in the town hospital, and was presumably buried in a pauper's grave, which is now lost. \"One cannot explain Gwen John away,\" Stewart says. \"No matter whether you think her good, bad or indifferent, there isn't anyone else like her. She is, and that's it.\" \u0095 Gwen John and Lucie Rie is at Spring Olympia, London W14 (0171-370 8212), from Tuesday.",

      "body": "<p>Two years ago I heard about a group of American women who were all called Linda. They were agitated that the name was becoming less common, so they decided to hold Lindaland conventions. That made me think, what would my Linderland be like?\" says artist and former punk musician Linder Sterling. </p> <p>Her forthcoming exhibition, The Return of Linderland, details that world, drawing on the films of Sergio Leone and the myth of the western cowboy for inspiration. With the help of three prosthetics technicians, she will transform herself into a young Clint Eastwood and, with a cast of local Manchester lads, reproduce scenes from Leone films. These will be freeze-framed and added to a show that includes a short film in which images of modern cowboys and country and western line-dancers merge with those of young men in her north Manchester community, and 12 foot cinematic diptychs that capture the drama of Leone, with attention to the detail of a gun, a face, or someone's shoe. </p> <p>\"I find glorious parallels between Leone's portrayal of the heroic and the malign with that of legal and illegal activity in north Manchester - or 'Gunchester',\" says Linder. \"Think of it as Lowry with guns.\" </p> <p>Linder has always opted for confrontation. In the late 70s she dressed in raw meat and a black dildo, and sang love songs in avant punk band Ludus. Combining pop art collage with punk anarchy, she juxtaposed images of hardcore porn with pictures from Woman's Realm and Factory album sleeves. Her graphic montage for the Buzzcocks' Orgasm Addict record cover, for instance, depicting a \"glamour\" nude with a household iron for a head and her nipples replaced with gleaming teeth, has become a feminist classic. </p> <p>By the late 80s she had given up music to concentrate on visual art. In the early 90s she documented the solo tours of her former lover Morrissey in a book of photographs called Morrissey Shot. Then in 1997 she put on a one-woman show What Did You Do in the Punk War, Mummy? at London's Cleveland Gallery - complete with Ludus album cover The Seduction, which features a woman's hips dressed in sexy fishnet stockings, belt and sanitary towel. Soon after that she filled a room in a disused school in Widnes with 42 tonnes of salt - \"a preserving, purging installation piece\" - that paved the way for the creation of Linderland. </p> <p>For this exhibition Linder casts herself as the Woman with no Name, invoking the spirit of Ann Lee, the charismatic founder of the 18th-century Shaker movement, an illiterate working-class Manchester woman who was persecuted by the authorities and to some extent written out of history. </p> <p>\"More and more I think that what is important is what is not included - the discard, the invisible - this is where the clues to truth hide,\" says Linder. In her show young lads and grizzled country line dancers create their own temporary celebrity and become Linderland superstars. \"People who usually feel anonymous or ignored will be named and elevated to gallery status. I am making work which lots of different people can relate to - dismantling the status of art.\" </p> <p>In Linderland there will also be a Shaker-inspired line-dancing performance piece on Saddleworth moor. Line dancing has always fascinated her. \"It echoes punk in that it's always in obscure clubs and people make their own clothes. Men and women sit at sewing machines to get their image together. There's no Armani, Nike or Gap - all labels are banished.\" Linder has a great belief in the pragmatic DIY process of art, something that stems from her childhood. </p> <p>Born in Liverpool in 1954 into an Irish working-class family, her mother was a hospital cleaner, her father a builder. Her parents go ballroom dancing six nights a week (\"my mum's always sewing sequins on something\"), and have an innate ability to make things. \"Part of me is very grounded and earthy. Almost mundane - get the bricks and the cement,\" says Linder. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, she gives short shrift to the \"culture of irony\" in Brit pop art. She may be dressed up as a cowboy, but she isn't kitsch. \"I'm bored by the whole materialist culture of irony that happened back in the 90s. All that stuff seems so 20th century now, self-serving and contemptuous of its audience.\" </p> <p>She created some of the most enduring images of punk, yet argues that \"shock\" artists like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin are not punk's natural descendants. \"The legacy of punk has bred a lot of envy in people who'd like to be pretenders to punk's throne. Punk was never funded and never subsidised. Also, we trusted no one,\" she asserts. Linderland is a place that's highly unfashionable; it's about \"faith and politics and community, a world where the terrain is harsh and people are volatile, but deep down they're concerned with real choices of survival.\" </p> <p>Up north, Linder is mapping out her own territory. </p> <p><strong>'Sergio looked at Clint Eastwood and saw a block of marble'</strong><br> Location: a lounge for design dons in the Royal College of Art, central London. Grey-clothed eminences drift back to class after lunch, leaving the college rector, Christopher Frayling, enthusing about finding, near Almeria in Spain, not just the foundations of the bridge dynamited in Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker, a spaghetti western now known only unto true devotees, but gun emplacements dug for its stars, James Coburn and Rod Steiger. Oh, and 15 miles north of Monument Valley in Arizona, he spotted the remains of the brick arch from which Charles Bronson's \"brother\" was hanged in Once Upon a Time in the West... </p> <p>There are respectable reasons for all this fan talk. Frayling's biography of Leone, Something To Do With Death, is released next month, and FilmFour is running a season featuring Leone's Clint Eastwood movies. </p> <p>Frayling first saw A Fistful of Dollars, then on belated release in Britain, one afternoon at the Odeon, Cambridge, after the 1967 May ball, which ended in a row with his girlfriend, followed by a bout of blokeish gloom. He was cheered up and turned on by the movie. That bad attitudinousness! That foul cigar butt! The western hero as a logo, The Man With No Name as a brand name, his gunhand filling the widescreen frame, all action and image projection and no inner life. Everything a lad in a post-girl mood could want. </p> <p>Perhaps the crucial line in Frayling's biog is Leone's confession that at 14 he couldn't join the Italian resistance during the second world war because his mamma wouldn't let him. But there is also a waspish account of why he cast Eastwood as Fistful's mysterious hero. \"The story is told that when Michelangelo was asked what he had seen in one particular block of marble, which he chose among hundreds of others, he replied that he saw Moses,\" Leone said. \"I would offer the same answer to the question why did I choose Clint Eastwood, only backwards_ What I saw, simply, was a block of marble. And that was what I wanted.\" </p> <p>Frayling converted his reaction to A Fistful of Dollars and its follow-ups into a culture studies tome on spaghetti westerns in the 70s, seriously valuing Leone when his films were B-rated in the US and Britain. He delved into the archaeology of Italian pop cinema and found Leone's father had been a director of silent sword-and- sandal epics. Frayling left a copy of the book at Sergio Leone's office, full of info on Papa that was new to Leone Jr. They met at the maestro's request in a London hotel in 1982 and then regularly to talk until Leone's death in 1989, so this first biography of Leone has been decades in the making. </p> <p>Frayling obviously still relishes what Leone created: the western as a Catholic, Latin, Mediterranean carnival, alluding to the Sicilian and Neapolitan puppet plays Leone knew, in which the pretensions of chivalry are mocked and tall, noble heroes come to the same end in the dust as picaresque clowns. (Leone's gun battles, Frayling points out, aren't stand-up duels. They circle around arenas: bullfighting dances of death.) The screen was Leone's means of apprehending the world and his way of expressing it. </p> <p>Artists need a landscape of the imagination. It doesn't have to be real: what the Japanese call \"landscapes of our dreams\" (for example, Paris as imagined by MGM) may well have greater power. Leone's \"landscape of dreams\" was the west. He adored the western, for which there was a worldwide demand unsatisfied since Hollywood circa 1960 demoted the genre to television series, rather than big-screen production. In Fistful, Leone dodgily borrowed a plot from Kurosawa's samurai adventure Yojimbo (itself swiped from Dashiell Hammett's comic novel of Montana corruption, Red Harvest) and shot it as a western. He quoted the westerns he knew by heart, their physical world and significant scenes magnified, transformed through the lens of his own culture. Not to mention the yellow Almerian skies under which spags were cheaply shot, with - as Frayling discovered - actors pissing behind rocks for lack of facilities. </p> <p>Frayling believes Leone's visceral grasp of imagery, the way he put together Ennio Morricone's music, sun and shadow, made him an artist of collages - the preferred surrealist technique. (He once saw a surrealist painting by De Chirico that Leone bought the year he made The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: high-contrast light on a colonnade and on a cow-catchered western locomotive - the whole movie on a small canvas.) That made Leone, in Baudrillard's description, the first postmodernist director, \"the first to understand the hall of mirrors within the contemporary culture of quotations\". </p> <p>Although Leone is not at present in critical favour, especially in his native land, the original movie brats of the Lucas-Spielberg-Carpenter generation venerated him and paid onscreen tribute. (Frayling will soon stage an exhibition on the spags in the scholarly Gene Autry museum in Los Angeles, taking pasta right into the heartland of the red-meat western: he's really chuffed about that.) Tarantino or John Woo's chief choice for any climax of conflict is the Mexican stand- off, Leone-style. And movie Tex-Mex as we know it was very much Leone's invention, the duster coats, the cantina and church, the snorts of burros. Frayling's students, he notes, \"get\" Leone immediately. </p> <p>It's not all style, Frayling insists: Leone had content, too. Not necessarily intellectual content - there was not much in the pronouncements of his festival-attending auteur phase. But as a story-teller, he was Scheherazade-class, could raise millions for a project just on his prolonged description of its opening shot punctuated with draws on his Havana cigar. And regard how he stocked his horizon-width screens with clutter of some character, with his passion for the handmade object. He encouraged designer Carlo Simi to build western towns stoutly, one reusing mighty logs from Orson Welles's Falstaff: they stand even now. He borrowed real museum weaponry (anachronistic, but great-looking) for his wars. He was in the David Lean league for trains onscreen. Leone was a spectacularist - the west as amphitheatre show. Tortillas and circuses. </p> <p>The coffee's cold, college admin awaits, Frayling has to go. Leone, he remarks on his way out, was only 60 when he died. Juvenile for a maker of westerns. We briefly imagine Leone living to oversee the TV mini-series he concocted about a Colt custom-made for Clint Eastwood and then passed hand to hand across the west. Fairytales for adults, what Leone always wanted to make. They wouldn't shoot it in Almeria now. They'd locate in the US south-west, maybe do exteriors down around Durango, locales busting a gut to resemble the west Leone imagined into being 35 years ago. Frayling recalls how Leone flew a minion to Utah for a sample of sand so he could colour-match a wall in an interior in Cinecitta. </p> <p>Wow. That's heroic untruth. The essence of movies. We're at the college front door. Remember, says Frayling, shaking hands, print the legend. </p> <p>\u0095 The Return of Linderland is at the Cornerhouse, Manchester from March 24-May 6.

Although Labour and Downing Street officials insisted that even cabinet ministers were being kept in the dark about the result, there were growing signs that Labour's complicated electoral college system may have saved the day for Tony Blair's candidate, even as the ballot results piled up for Mr Livingstone. With the formal announcement of the winner due early tomorrow afternoon, Labour's Millbank headquarters yesterday contacted the Dobson campaign team to discuss possible joint arrangements for Sunday and Monday, though no such approach was made to the Livingstone camp. However, returns from affiliated trade unions - the latest being the public services giant, Unison - are still showing commanding majorities for the former Greater London council leader, and there were still doubts among some officials that Mr Dobson had picked up the 36%-plus he needs from individual Labour members to win. The Labour hierarchy has been taking no chances. It was alleged yesterday that one MP who recently switched support to Mr Dobson had done so after discussions with the prime minister about a possible peerage. Unison members yesterday delivered a four-to-one majority for Mr Livingstone giving the Brent East MP a 69% share, against 17% for Mr Dobson and 14% for Glenda Jack son - this is worth 6% of the electoral college, That result reflects the pattern in all the union ballots, where Mr Livingstone has taken between 60% and 90%. Only two unions, which decided not to ballot, the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and the ISTC steel union, have backed Mr Dobson. The former health secretary has won two ballots narrowly, held by the Fabian Society and the Labour Zionist group Poale Zion. In his submission to the Labour party and the scrutineers, Unity Security Balloting, Mr Livingstone will call for the votes of all those affiliated organisations which failed to ballot to be excluded from the count. He will also formally challenge the inclusion of the vote of Pauline Green, who retired as a London MEP last December, and the recent exclusion of the clerical branch of the Graphical Paper and Media Union, which voted heavily for Mr Livingstone but has been ruled out for late affiliation payment.

It is hard to bear the thought of their disappointment when their hope is denied at last. </p> <p>It is taken for a truism that hope is essential to the business of living. What would it be to have no hopes, to believe that things only get worse, to expect failure and anticipate defeat? That is scarcely a life. In good times, say those who approve of optimism, hope is a prompt to yet better things; in bad times it is a comfort, because it sustains the idea of relief or rescue, of reward or at least justice at last. Even at the very worst, when we accept that hopes deceive, we recognise that they nevertheless provide \"an agreeable route\", as la Rochefoucauld put it, \"to the end of our lives\". </p> <p>But there are always those who disagree. History, they say, shows that dark nights have often cost mankind less pain than false dawns. The deceitfulness of hope gives it a bad name; Euripides observed that for 10,000 men there are 10,000 hopes, but very few are realised. It offers lies as truth, and traps people in vain pursuits, which lead them on to greater disillusionments later. \"Just as dumb creatures are snared by food, human beings would not be caught unless they had a nibble of hope,\" Petronius remarked. </p> <p>Hope - the cynics continue - is distorting; it makes what is genuinely ugly and bad in life appear no more than a temporary screen for what is beautiful and good. It is therefore allied to illusion: \"One day everything will be well, that is our hope,\" said Voltaire; \"today everything is fine, that is our illusion.\" </p> <p>The fact that hope always applies to the future makes it a cheaply purchased, endlessly renewable commodity - the latter because as old hopes die, new ones can be raised in their place as swiftly and easily as thought. But is a life of false hope, or mere hope, or nothing but hope, a finer and nobler thing than a life squarely based on facing realities, and knowing them for what they are? \"Hope is the worst of evils,\" Nietzsche famously said, \"for it prolongs the torment of man.\" </p> <p>It might be argued that cynics start from the wrong premise. They observe the human propensity to daydream and fantasise, to cling to vain hopes in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence, to nurture unrealistic expectations and ambitions. They fail to recognise that out of this compost sometimes grows surprising blossoms of novelty and success. Most of what has moved the world onwards began as a hope; all of what has moved it backwards has involved the death of hopes. </p> <p>On the tough view that interprets hope as a weakness rather than a virtue, what we have to embrace is truth. But the only indisputable truth about the human condition, say hope's defenders, is that we can suffer, and that we shall die. The rest is for us to create. </p> <p>What would we make of ourselves without hope? We could adopt the posture of nihilism: but that is a life worse than death. For some, indeed, death is hope's only alternative. Albert Camus identified philosophy's central question as: \"Shall I commit suicide?\" for if the answer is \"No\", the implication is that there are things worth hoping for. </p> <p>Cynics object to treating hope as a virtue because it rarely bears fruit. But that, say hope's defenders, is to see things upside down. Hope is a virtue independent of its realisations; it is an intrinsic value, an end in itself, allied to courage and imagination, a positive attitude full of possibility and aspiration. For that reason you discover more about a person when you learn about his hopes than when you count his achievements, for the best of what we are lies in what we hope to be. </p>",

Albert Camus identified philosophy's central question as: \"Shall I commit suicide?\" for if the answer is \"No\", the implication is that there are things worth hoping for. Cynics object to treating hope as a virtue because it rarely bears fruit. But that, say hope's defenders, is to see things upside down. Hope is a virtue independent of its realisations; it is an intrinsic value, an end in itself, allied to courage and imagination, a positive attitude full of possibility and aspiration. For that reason you discover more about a person when you learn about his hopes than when you count his achievements, for the best of what we are lies in what we hope to be.",

More than usual, we thought, and this meant they wanted to draw us into the area ready for a gunman. We stood our ground.</p> <p>\"Take cover,\" I shouted. Moments later the children cleared completely, and we knew something was about to happen. The soldiers pressed themselves more closely into the tarmac. Four shots broke the menacing silence: Corporal Lewis and another soldier were hit, one in the thigh the other in the arm. Just a few inches of body showing around the corner and the gunman had got them.</p> <p>I remember the blood running down the road; the sense of desperation, calling up the armoured ambulance and having to wait; the shouting and the feverish attempts at stopping the blood pumping out of his main artery. Now there wasn't a child to be seen. They had done their bit. We stopped the bleeding, the crash crew arrived at last. Our mates were sped to the Royal Victoria Hospital to live another day. One lost his leg.</p> <p>The year was 1972. We had arrived in Belfast with the 1st Battalion the Light Infantry on \"Bloody Friday\", the IRA's answer to \"Bloody Sunday\" a few months before: nine civilians killed and 130 injured on one day.

The houses were similar to those we lived in. The children had been able to swear at us in our own language. This was not a strange enemy neighbourhood, but a war within our own country. Coming from the mainland, I could only wonder what we had done to deserve so much hatred and violence. Civil violence doesn't come from nowhere. It is a last resort by desperate people.

Had we been duped into taking sides and fighting the loyalists' battle for them? What had changed in three years?</p> <p>Today I see the self-righteousness of the loyalist leadership, claiming British standards and British support. Of course, they seem to say, we have no guns, real democrats don't need guns.

Instead over many years the unionist majority has continued to flaunt sectarian dominance and to treat Catholics with disrespect and institutional prejudice.</p> <p>So now we see the collapse of the Good Friday agreement. Unionists insist they can stand on the moral high ground. They have no arms. They believe they are clean. But are they really? Are Sinn Fein and the IRA in the wrong? Some say the IRA has no more weapons than gangs in any of the large cities in the US. So what's the big deal?

      "bodyText": "\"The kids are clearing, boss,\" Corporal Lewis shouted at me. I was 50 yards down the road trying to persuade a foreign camera team to get permission from our HQ before filming soldiers on the street corner. I turned my back on the TV crew and ran briskly to my patrol. We had been doing our duty, standing between Protestant and Catholic children on the Crumlin Road as they made their way home after school. These were the \"Lollipop\" patrols. In this our third day into the new term, the Catholic children had been pelting us with bottles and stones for over half an hour. More than usual, we thought, and this meant they wanted to draw us into the area ready for a gunman. We stood our ground. \"Take cover,\" I shouted. Moments later the children cleared completely, and we knew something was about to happen. The soldiers pressed themselves more closely into the tarmac. Four shots broke the menacing silence: Corporal Lewis and another soldier were hit, one in the thigh the other in the arm. Just a few inches of body showing around the corner and the gunman had got them. I remember the blood running down the road; the sense of desperation, calling up the armoured ambulance and having to wait; the shouting and the feverish attempts at stopping the blood pumping out of his main artery. Now there wasn't a child to be seen. They had done their bit. We stopped the bleeding, the crash crew arrived at last. Our mates were sped to the Royal Victoria Hospital to live another day. One lost his leg. The year was 1972. We had arrived in Belfast with the 1st Battalion the Light Infantry on \"Bloody Friday\", the IRA's answer to \"Bloody Sunday\" a few months before: nine civilians killed and 130 injured on one day. Our training had been in riot control but now we were plunged into a vicious shooting war with the Provisional IRA. Two months on, three soldiers had died and 15 had been seriously wounded. Two more were to die before the tour ended. Standing on the corner after this incident, I struggled to grasp the enormity of what I was witnessing. This was not a street in some foreign land.

Due to a heavy turnout, voting was extended for two hours. Some polling stations even ran out of ballot papers. The reformers had portrayed the contest as a referendum on the Khatami presidency and its ambitious programme to create a true civil society. That strategy has apparently been rewarded.

Other supporters of the president said they were confident of victory, based on a survey of 100 polling stations in Tehran and information from campaign workers in other large cities. Many voters, even those in districts that are traditionally conservative, said they were casting ballots for the first time since the 1979 revolution because they felt, for once, that their voice mattered. \"I have never voted since the revolution and I didn't vote for Khatami when he ran for president,\" said Mohammed Yusefi, a 37-year-old merchant, casting his ballot in south Tehran, which is mainly conservative. \"In previous elections there were no diverse candidates.

Witwatersrand university in Johannesburg is also investigating suspicions that Professor Werner Bezwoda experimented on dozens of black women for the research without their consent. The university suspended Dr Bezwoda as head of haematology and clinical oncology after he admitted in writing to \"a serious breach of scientific honesty and integrity\" by lying about the conduct of experiments which claimed to show that high doses of chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplants were more effective than existing treatments for breast cancer. The study was hailed as a \"ray of hope\" for women with advanced breast cancer when it was presented to an international conference of 12,000 researchers in the US last May. It was approved by some of the doctor's peers but was contradicted by four other studies. John Durant, vice-president of the US oncology society which hosted the conference, said the research was worthless. \"I'm very angry at Bezwoda personally.

Their suspicions were roused by missing data and the professor's refusal to provide paperwork for half of the 154 women he claimed were part of his study. \"You could conclude that they might not exist.

      "bodyText": "Hopes that the European Union can develop its own military forces have been dealt an early blow by the embarrassing realisation that the headquarters of its brand new planning bodies have almost no security. Officials last night admitted to grave concerns about lapses involving the Justus Lipsius building, home to the council of ministers, but a place more used to holding talks about agriculture and the environment than sensitive defence issues. Justus Lipsius, built of polished pink granite, is one of the grandest edifices in the EU quarter of central Brussels but a nightmare for anyone worried about spies or terrorists. Two cleaning workers, on contract to the council, were found to have criminal records, while US intelligence agencies discovered during apparently routine eavesdropping that EU employees were using office phones to make private calls, diplomats said. Late one night, Javier Solana, the EU's new foreign and security policy chief, encountered a crowd of complete strangers milling around outside his fifth-floor private office, and later complained that the building has \"as many holes as Swiss cheese\". Mr Solana, a former Spanish foreign minister who was secretary general of Nato until moving across town last October, does not even have a secure phone in his office and is now lobbying hard for leak-proof premises. It is extremely urgent. Earlier this week the EU took the historic step of setting up a political and security committee and a parallel military staff body to advance the European security and defence identity - of which Mr Solana is the keeper. Its most ambitious goal is for the EU to launch its own 60,000-strong rapid reaction force by 2003. The idea is that in a future crisis, EU forces could act without relying on the US, as they did in Kosovo, but would borrow Nato transport planes and satellite intelligence. Nato, not surprisingly, insists that the Europeans improve their virtually non-existent security if they want to share the alliance's secrets. \"Frankly, at the moment, if you give the council a document you might as well just give it straight to CNN,\" complained one exasperated official. \"They just have no culture of being security conscious - and there's no quick fix for that.\" EU sources deny that a concealed microphone was found in an interpreters' booth, but horrified security consultants discovered during a rare debugging sweep several weeks ago that the facilities for allowing officials to listen in on ministerial meetings could be easily monitored. Computer networks are also far too insecure to handle classified material, so the EU's 15 member states, especially big military players such as Britain, are refusing point blank to allow their own secret documents into the building. Justus Lipsius - which has a vast and potentially dangerous underground car park - houses hundreds of translators and clerical staff, and up to 1,200 people come in though half a dozen separate entrances every day. It was hoped that a secure area could be created inside the building, but it is now almost certain that the new committees - starting work on March 1 and eventually likely to comprise 100 military and civilian personnel - will have to find a home elsewhere. The most obvious site for a custom-built EU defence headquarters is an adjacent lot, but that was sold recently by the Belgian government and is now a car park. Rental is the next best option. \"We have got to move out for reasons of space and security,\" said one official. \"If we cannot guarantee confidentiality, the Americans and Nato are never going to let us have the information we will need to manage a crisis.\" British sources say an EU version of the official secrets act may be needed, but senior council staff protest that they are vetted by their own governments and the Belgian authorities, as well as signing confidentiality agreements.",

      "bodyText": "A Royal Navy Lynx surveillance helicopter is to play a key role in next month's re-enactment of the end of the Branch Davidian siege at Waco, Texas, in 1993 where 74 people died. The re-enactment is being organised by Peterborough-based Vector Data Systems, a British arm of an American hi-tech defence contractor. The exercise, to recreate the dramatic climax of the Waco siege, will be conducted at Fort Hood, a US military base near Waco, and is intended to provide the answers to a series of passionately contested questions concerning the role of the FBI in the conclusion of the 51-day siege. The field test using the Lynx will be crucial in two investigations into the end of the siege and could make or break dozens of US justice department and FBI careers. The test will also determine whether relatives of the Waco victims receive millions of dollars in compensation from the US government. The Lynx is equipped with infra-red surveillance cameras manufactured by BAE Systems similar to one used by the bureau at the time of the Waco siege. Videos taken by the FBI on the day that the siege ended, April 19, 1993, are at the heart of the argument over whether the bureau fired shots or launched grenades that contributed to the deaths of the Davidians, including many children. For nearly seven years, families of the Davidians killed during the siege have been trying to mount a wrongful killing lawsuit against the US federal government. They allege that the FBI - either on the orders of the attorney general Janet Reno or not - deliberately began the fire that engulfed the Davidian compound and fired on the cult members inside. The official verdict on Waco has always been that the fire was started by the Davidians themselves, acting on the orders of the cult's leader, David Koresh. The issue has become a cause celebre among US conspiracy theorists and rightwing anti-government groups, which believe that Waco is proof that Washington is committed to a military-style repression of people who sometimes see themselves as armed freedom fighters. Last year the FBI discovered a previously unacknowledged videotape of the siege at the Davidian compound which contained evidence that the FBI had fired at least two tear-gas grenades during the fire - something which Ms Reno and the bureau had always denied. News of the discovery was the biggest breakthrough so far for the relatives, and led to an official re-investigation of the end of the siege, conducted by former Republican Senator John Danforth. One of the key unanswered questions arising from the video is whether a series of flashes which are visible on the tape show gunfire, as the plaintiffs claim Until now, the FBI has opposed any moves for a recreation of the final hours of the siege, arguing that revealing any information about the surveillance camera, including even the name of its manufacturer, would jeopardise law enforcement secrets and national security. However both Mr Danforth and US District Judge Walter Smith, the Waco judge who is hearing the relatives' civil suit, have approved a restaging next month, and this week an unidentified British scientist working on the project told the court than none of the information that would be revealed was considered sensitive or secret in the UK. \"The British military representatives said the only thing that's classified is if someone goes in and takes video footage inside the aircraft,\" Edward Allard, a representative of the Davidian relatives' legal team, said. British diplomatic sources in Washington confirmed that a single Royal Navy Lynx, along with its nine-member crew, is being loaned by the Ministry of Defence at the request of Mr Danforth. The cost of transporting the British equipment and personnel across the Atlantic to Texas has been estimated at about $300,000 (\u00a3187,000). The managing director of Vector Data Systems, John Barry, refused to comment on his company's precise role in the exercise yesterday. Vector Data Systems is owned by the US-based Antion corporation and specialises in the military application of hi-tech imaging systems. Its systems have been used to train pilots on low-flying missions in Kosovo and Bosnia.",

The Dalai Lama was joined at celebrations - marking the 60th anniversary of his enthronement - by the young Buddhist leader, the Karmapa, who recently fled Chinese-controlled Tibet. There was little interaction between the two at the festivities in Dharamsala, the town in northern India where the exiled Dalai Lama is based. But aides say they have formed a strong bond in recent weeks. The Karmapa crossed secretly into India with a small entourage on January 5. He was said to be seeking religious instruction denied to him by Chinese authorities. The 14-year-old lama was among four senior religious figures on the upper pavilion of the Namgyal monastery in Dharmsala yesterday. The Dalai Lama smiled and laughed through much of the four-hour ceremony and he tapped the Karmapa's hand as he blessed the monks and lamas. The Tibetan spiritual leader is reported to have held five meetings with the Karmapa since his arrival in India, including dress rehearsals on Thursday and a special blessing audience on Tibetan new year's day. The selection of Urgyen Trinley Dorje as the Karmapa was one of the few points of agreement between Beijing and Dharamsala, and his flight has been a blow to China's attempts to co-opt the Tibetan religious establishment. There has been speculation about the Karmapa's future. His Karma Kagyu sect was, at one time, politically powerful in Tibet before the ascendancy of the Dalai Lama's sect. There have been fears that during the period between the Dalai Lama's death and the selection and education of what the Tibetan Buddhists would consider his reincarnation, a leadership vacuum could develop among Tibetan exiles.

      "body": "<p>Two of the three largest brewers in Britain may end up in foreign hands following takeover approaches to both Bass and Whitbread from overseas beer groups. </p> <p>The hotels, pubs and brewing group, Bass, yesterday said it was looking at all the options for the future of its brewery business, which is the second largest in the country and produces brands such as Carling lager, Worthington, Hooper's Hooch and Caffrey's. </p> <p>It is understood that Bass has received several offers for the business, which employs 4,000 people, including approaches from Heineken and South African Breweries. Regarded as one of the most efficient brewing operations in Britain, Bass sells one in every four pints and is expected to command a price of up to \u00a32bn. </p> <p>Whitbread, which axed plans to float its beer company after failing to buy Allied Domecq's large stable of pubs, is also understood to be exploring possible offers from foreign buyers. Heineken - whose lager Whitbread brews under licence in the UK - is believed to have expressed interest as has Interbrew, the European group whose Stella brand is also produced under licence in Britain by Whitbread. </p> <p>The group declined to comment on any approaches but a spokesman said: \"Brewing is not central to our business so there is the expectation that we will exit from this at some time when conditions are right. It would be correct to say we are reviewing our options.\" Insiders, however, admitted that overtures have been made. </p> <p>Like Bass, which has been concentrating on its higher return businesses such as hotels and leisure retailing, Whitbread is keen to focus on the more exciting operations in its portfolio such as hotels, restaurants, pubs and the David Lloyd leisure clubs. </p> <p>If both companies secure buyers for their brewing businesses that will leave Scottish &amp; Newcastle as the only large, domestically owned brewer, but even then half a dozen of the group's leading brands, including Kronenbourg 1664, Miller and Beck's, are not owned but simply brewed under licence. Following the acquisition of Allied Domecq's beer operations, the Danish Carlsberg group is the fourth biggest player in the British market. </p> <p>Shares in Bass and Whitbread frothed up strongly early yesterday as the possibility of deals spread into the market. But some of the excitement surrounding Whitbread evaporated as traders realised that a transaction between Bass and Heineken could be fatal for the smaller group. </p> <p>Heineken is one of the most important brands for Whitbread's beer company and the contract would almost certainly be lost if Heineken acquired its own brewing capacity in the UK. </p> <p>There was also some scepticism that market traders might be exaggerating the possibility of big ticket takeovers in an effort to drive up the share prices of the major companies, helping Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle retain their place in the FTSE 100 at next month's review. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Two of the three largest brewers in Britain may end up in foreign hands following takeover approaches to both Bass and Whitbread from overseas beer groups. The hotels, pubs and brewing group, Bass, yesterday said it was looking at all the options for the future of its brewery business, which is the second largest in the country and produces brands such as Carling lager, Worthington, Hooper's Hooch and Caffrey's. It is understood that Bass has received several offers for the business, which employs 4,000 people, including approaches from Heineken and South African Breweries. Regarded as one of the most efficient brewing operations in Britain, Bass sells one in every four pints and is expected to command a price of up to \u00a32bn. Whitbread, which axed plans to float its beer company after failing to buy Allied Domecq's large stable of pubs, is also understood to be exploring possible offers from foreign buyers. Heineken - whose lager Whitbread brews under licence in the UK - is believed to have expressed interest as has Interbrew, the European group whose Stella brand is also produced under licence in Britain by Whitbread. The group declined to comment on any approaches but a spokesman said: \"Brewing is not central to our business so there is the expectation that we will exit from this at some time when conditions are right. It would be correct to say we are reviewing our options.\" Insiders, however, admitted that overtures have been made. Like Bass, which has been concentrating on its higher return businesses such as hotels and leisure retailing, Whitbread is keen to focus on the more exciting operations in its portfolio such as hotels, restaurants, pubs and the David Lloyd leisure clubs. If both companies secure buyers for their brewing businesses that will leave Scottish &amp; Newcastle as the only large, domestically owned brewer, but even then half a dozen of the group's leading brands, including Kronenbourg 1664, Miller and Beck's, are not owned but simply brewed under licence. Following the acquisition of Allied Domecq's beer operations, the Danish Carlsberg group is the fourth biggest player in the British market. Shares in Bass and Whitbread frothed up strongly early yesterday as the possibility of deals spread into the market. But some of the excitement surrounding Whitbread evaporated as traders realised that a transaction between Bass and Heineken could be fatal for the smaller group. Heineken is one of the most important brands for Whitbread's beer company and the contract would almost certainly be lost if Heineken acquired its own brewing capacity in the UK. There was also some scepticism that market traders might be exaggerating the possibility of big ticket takeovers in an effort to drive up the share prices of the major companies, helping Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle retain their place in the FTSE 100 at next month's review.",

      "bodyText": "The shake-out of the hard-pressed dairy industry began yesterday as Dairy Crest announced plans to merge its business with the milk and cheese operations of Unigate. The move, designed to improve returns from the commodity milk and unbranded cheese businesses, is expected to mean the loss of hundreds of jobs as the group attempts to cut costs by \u00a325m a year. It is also expected to kick-start much wider rationalisation in an industry which has too many operators and is being squeezed by the mighty supermarket groups. John Worby, the finance director of Unigate, said his company had \"talked long and hard with lots of people\" in the industry and that the merger with Dairy Crest offered the best potential. But he accepted that the deal was likely to trigger consolidation among the industry's weaker players, some of which might withdraw altogether. \"The industry has needed consolidation... the parts of the industry which are relatively undifferentiated have found things hard going, and this is the area in which you have to be as efficient as possible and that means being larger rather than smaller. This deal goes to the heart of that.\" Dairy Crest, whose brands include Cathedral City, Clover and Yoplait, has a workforce of about 3800 people - including 900 milkmen - and that will more than double once employees from Unigate have transferred over. The company had sales of nearly \u00a3775m in its last financial year and profits of about \u00a345m. The business it is acquiring is almost exactly the same size - with a turnover of nearly \u00a3750m and profits of some \u00a351.5m. Under the terms of the transaction Dairy Crest will issue 75.7m new shares in exchange for Unigate's dairy and cheese businesses, which will transfer with \u00a3100m of debt. Once the deal is complete, Dairy Crest shareholders will control 60% of the enlarged group while Unigate investors will have a 40% stake. Unigate says it now intends to focus strongly on convenience foods and logistics, and is already looking around for acquisitions in the UK and on the European mainland. The group recently acquired Terranova, the chilled food business formerly owned by Hillsdown, and took over another convenience operation, Marie, from Danone of France. The enlarged convenience food operation has sales of about \u00a31.1bn a year - two-thirds of Unigate's entire income - and a quarter of food income is now generated on the European mainland. Shares in Unigate shed 12.75p to close at 246.25p, while Dairy Crest edged 1p higher to 158.5p as the group expects to have to spend \u00a330m in one-off cash costs plus \u00a335m of capital spending to reconfigure facilities and achieve savings.

      "bodyText": "Leading blue chips ended a volatile week on a subdued note, hit hard late in the day by a slide on Wall Street which after London closed stretched to 2.3% on the Dow Jones index. The FTSE 100 itself ended the session down 44.3 points at 6,165 - above its 6,151.4 low of the day but well below the 6,264.1 high seen early in trading. But the selling was confined to the blue chips, with both the Mid 250 and Small Cap indicators closing in positive territory. Halifax retained pole position among the leaders - up another 13% or 73p to 625p - as investors continued to warm to the bank's move to business on the internet. Woolwich added 20p to 306p in sympathy and Abbey National - which launched its own internet bank, Cahoot, on Thursday - firmed 13p to 726p. Norwich Union , tipped by Goldman Sachs as a \"market outperformer\", also attracted fresh buying as vague bid rumours once again did the rounds. The shares closed 26p higher at 435p. Away from the e-economy, Bass was made some progress, adding 6p to 701p after confirming that it is reviewing strategic options for its brewing arm. Dutch brewing group Heineken has already signalled its interest in the division, which brews Caffrey's and Carlsberg lager, with South African Breweries also mooted as a possible buyer. Scottish &amp; Newcastle firmed 7p to 397p, while Whitbread gave up early strength to finish the day 10p lower at 488p. Over in the insurance sector Prudential saw its shares slump after the sudden departure of its finance director, Les Cullen, after only 5 months in the job and a month after the appointment of Jonathan Bloomer as chief executive designate. The stock finished above its worst, down 9p at 981p. Chip designer ARM Holdings came under pressure, down 79p at \u00a343.28 as a few investors locked in some profits. There was also some more profit-taking in recent high flyer WPP , which closed 25p lower at \u00a310.03 after this week's solid figures. Most big brokers remain very positive on the advertising group. Elsewhere, there was further demand for biotech stocks. Celltech stood out with a 100p gain to \u00a310.02.",

      "byline": "Jeremy Lee",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> A parfait of pear</strong></p> <p> Jane Grigson describes this dessert as a poetic finish to a special meal. It is. </p> <p><strong> 250g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>125ml water </strong></p> <p><strong>4 very fresh, large egg whites </strong></p> <p><strong>750g Williams pears </strong></p> <p><strong>1 lemon, juiced </strong></p> <p><strong>300ml double cream </strong></p> <p><strong>4 tbsp pear eau de vie</strong> </p> <p>In a pan, dissolve the sugar in the water over a low heat until the liquid is clear. Bring up to boil, and maintain the pace until the syrup reaches 120C (you can be precise if you have a kitchen thermometer; otherwise, just make sure it's very hot). Should the sugar crystallise on the sides of the pan, wash it down with a brush dipped in cold water. </p> <p>In a scrupulously cleaned bowl, whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks, then pour in the hot syrup and beat until the meringue stiffens into a great white mass. Peel and core the pears, and chop their flesh. Place the pear pieces in a pan, along with the lemon juice, and cook gently until the fruit has softened. Process into a pur\u00e9e. </p> <p>Lightly whip the cream, then fold it carefully into the meringue mix. Now fold in the eau de vie and the pur\u00e9e. Spoon into a 1-litre terrine or mould, cover and freeze, preferably overnight. To serve, unmould, cut into slices with a heated knife and dish up with some almond or vanilla thins. </p> <p><strong> Walnut praline ice cream</strong></p> <p> This will feed more than six, so there's plenty for second helpings. <br> </p> <p><strong> 250g shelled walnuts </strong></p> <p><strong>142ml water </strong></p> <p><strong>320g sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>142ml milk </strong></p> <p><strong>4 egg yolks </strong></p> <p><strong>3 tbsp dark rum </strong></p> <p><strong>284ml double cream</strong> </p> <p>You can freeze this either in individual ramekins or somesuch or, as I do, in a lovely big bowl. Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Put the walnuts on a flat tray and roast until quite brown - do not scorch. </p> <p>Put the water in a heavy-bottomed, stainless-steel pan and place over a medium heat. Pour in the sugar, and stir until dissolved. The syrup will start to colour after a couple of minutes and then darken; you're after a caramel that is dark but not burnt. Once the caramel is right, remove from the heat, tip in the roasted walnuts and stir very carefully - a caramel burn is pain beyond endurance. Lightly oil a tray, spread out the mixture on it, and leave to cool and set. </p> <p>Set the cooking pan to one side, as any caramel stuck to the bottom will be used up later. Once cooled, break up the now-brittle praline into a bowl, then grind into a rough-cut powder with large chunks within. Put the milk in the caramel pan, set it over a medium heat and stir until the caramel has dissolved. </p> <p>In a mixing bowl, beat the yolks until pale and grown in volume, then add a third of the praline powder, and beat until thick and tacky. Pour the heated milk in a thin, steady stream over this, return the whole lot to the pan and stir over a medium heat until it has thickened and bubbles have ceased to appear on the surface. </p> <p>Remove from the heat, stir in another third of the praline mix and stir until cooled. Transfer to a bowl suitable for an electric beater, and whisk at high speed until the custard thickens. Add the rum and, when the mix is quite cool, the rest of the praline. Whip the cream until it begins to hold a shape, fold into the custard and then transfer the ice cream into your vessel(s) of choice. Freeze, preferably overnight. Transfer from freezer to fridge an hour before eating . </p> <p><strong> Blood orange granita</strong></p> <p> I know all is meant to be metric these days, but sugar-to-water measures seem only to work in imperial, so there. <br> </p> <p><strong> 1 pint water </strong></p> <p><strong>1lb sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>2 pints blood orange juice </strong></p> <p><strong>1 small lemon, juiced</strong> </p> <p>In a pan, dissolve the sugar and water, bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Once it has cooled completely, sieve the orange and lemon juices, and pour into the syrup. Tip into a freezing tray and freeze. As the granita freezes, break it up every 30 minutes or so with a fork, until you have a great pile of crystals. Transfer to a container with a secure lid, and keep in the freezer, where it will last for at least a week. Serve in frozen glasses . </p> <p><strong> Melon and ginger sorbet </strong></p> <p> Use Charentais, if you can, but the main rule is that the melon is sweet and ripe. </p> <p><strong> 1 kg ripe melon flesh and juice </strong></p> <p><strong>115g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>3cm piece fresh ginger </strong></p> <p><strong>Juice of 1 small lemon</strong> </p> <p>Peel and grate the ginger over a plate, to keep as much juice as possible. Put all the ingredients into a liquidiser and pur\u00e9e until very smooth. Pass through a fine sieve, then churn in an ice cream machine. </p> <p><strong> Baked Alaska </strong></p> <p> The ice cream and sponge can be bought, but homemade elevates what is a good dessert into a very good one indeed. Both can be frozen until required, as can the finished dish.<br> </p> <p>For the sponge </p> <p><strong> 170g unsalted butter, softened </strong></p> <p><strong>170g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>3 very fresh, large eggs </strong></p> <p><strong>Zest and juice of 1 lemon </strong></p> <p><strong>170g self-raising flour, sifted</strong> </p> <p>For the vanilla ice cream </p> <p><strong> 1 vanilla pod </strong></p> <p><strong>60Oml milk </strong></p> <p><strong>7 egg yolks </strong></p> <p><strong>250g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>750ml double cream</strong> </p> <p>For the meringue </p> <p><strong> 4 egg whites </strong></p> <p><strong>85g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>4 tbsp apricot jam</strong> </p> <p>You'll need three roughly equal-sized rectangular vessels for this: a baking tin, for the sponge; a freezer container, for the ice cream; and a dish for the end-result. Make the sponge first. Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Lightly butter a sponge tin. Beat together the sugar and butter until pale. Crack the eggs into a jug, beat, and add in a slow stream to the butter/sugar mix. Beat in the lemon juice and rind, then fold in the flour. Put the batter in the tin, and bake for 25 minutes. </p> <p>Next, make the ice cream. Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds into a heavy-bottomed pan, drop in the pod and then pour in the milk. Place over a medium heat, and leave gently to infuse. In a large bowl, beat together the egg yolks and sugar, and, once the milk is scalded, pour it over this eggy mixture, stirring all the while. Pour back into the pot, return to the heat and stir constantly until the custard thickens and the bubbles on the surface disappear. Still stirring, pour in the cream, then leave to stand for an hour, so the vanilla flavour can fully permeate the cream. Strain and churn in an ice-cream machine. Scoop into the rectangular mould, and freeze. </p> <p>Now you're ready to assemble the baked Alaska. First, choose a suitable dish that will go happily from freezer to oven to table. Now make the meringue: beat in the egg whites until they are stiff but not dry, beat in half the sugar until stiff peaks are regained, then fold in the rest of the sugar. Spread a not-too-deep layer of meringue at the base of the dish. Cut the sponge in half horizontally, and spread apricot jam over one side of each piece. Lay a slice of sponge, jam-side up, on top of the meringue. Unmould the ice cream and place it as a block on top of the sponge. Place the second piece of sponge, jam-side down, on the ice cream, and then cover with meringue, making sure that it completely seals the cake. </p> <p>The Alaska will stay happily in the freezer until required. To cook, bake for six to eight minutes in a pre-heated oven at 230C/450F/gas mark 8, until golden in colour and flecked with little dark spots. Eat there and then</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, London SE1.</p>",

It is. 250g caster sugar 125ml water 4 very fresh, large egg whites 750g Williams pears 1 lemon, juiced 300ml double cream 4 tbsp pear eau de vie In a pan, dissolve the sugar in the water over a low heat until the liquid is clear. Bring up to boil, and maintain the pace until the syrup reaches 120C (you can be precise if you have a kitchen thermometer; otherwise, just make sure it's very hot). Should the sugar crystallise on the sides of the pan, wash it down with a brush dipped in cold water. In a scrupulously cleaned bowl, whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks, then pour in the hot syrup and beat until the meringue stiffens into a great white mass. Peel and core the pears, and chop their flesh. Place the pear pieces in a pan, along with the lemon juice, and cook gently until the fruit has softened. Process into a pur\u00e9e. Lightly whip the cream, then fold it carefully into the meringue mix. Now fold in the eau de vie and the pur\u00e9e. Spoon into a 1-litre terrine or mould, cover and freeze, preferably overnight. To serve, unmould, cut into slices with a heated knife and dish up with some almond or vanilla thins. Walnut praline ice cream This will feed more than six, so there's plenty for second helpings. 250g shelled walnuts 142ml water 320g sugar 142ml milk 4 egg yolks 3 tbsp dark rum 284ml double cream You can freeze this either in individual ramekins or somesuch or, as I do, in a lovely big bowl. Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Put the walnuts on a flat tray and roast until quite brown - do not scorch. Put the water in a heavy-bottomed, stainless-steel pan and place over a medium heat. Pour in the sugar, and stir until dissolved. The syrup will start to colour after a couple of minutes and then darken; you're after a caramel that is dark but not burnt. Once the caramel is right, remove from the heat, tip in the roasted walnuts and stir very carefully - a caramel burn is pain beyond endurance. Lightly oil a tray, spread out the mixture on it, and leave to cool and set. Set the cooking pan to one side, as any caramel stuck to the bottom will be used up later. Once cooled, break up the now-brittle praline into a bowl, then grind into a rough-cut powder with large chunks within. Put the milk in the caramel pan, set it over a medium heat and stir until the caramel has dissolved. In a mixing bowl, beat the yolks until pale and grown in volume, then add a third of the praline powder, and beat until thick and tacky. Pour the heated milk in a thin, steady stream over this, return the whole lot to the pan and stir over a medium heat until it has thickened and bubbles have ceased to appear on the surface. Remove from the heat, stir in another third of the praline mix and stir until cooled. Transfer to a bowl suitable for an electric beater, and whisk at high speed until the custard thickens. Add the rum and, when the mix is quite cool, the rest of the praline. Whip the cream until it begins to hold a shape, fold into the custard and then transfer the ice cream into your vessel(s) of choice. Freeze, preferably overnight. Transfer from freezer to fridge an hour before eating . Blood orange granita I know all is meant to be metric these days, but sugar-to-water measures seem only to work in imperial, so there. 1 pint water 1lb sugar 2 pints blood orange juice 1 small lemon, juiced In a pan, dissolve the sugar and water, bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Once it has cooled completely, sieve the orange and lemon juices, and pour into the syrup. Tip into a freezing tray and freeze. As the granita freezes, break it up every 30 minutes or so with a fork, until you have a great pile of crystals. Transfer to a container with a secure lid, and keep in the freezer, where it will last for at least a week. Serve in frozen glasses . Melon and ginger sorbet Use Charentais, if you can, but the main rule is that the melon is sweet and ripe. 1 kg ripe melon flesh and juice 115g caster sugar 3cm piece fresh ginger Juice of 1 small lemon Peel and grate the ginger over a plate, to keep as much juice as possible. Put all the ingredients into a liquidiser and pur\u00e9e until very smooth. Pass through a fine sieve, then churn in an ice cream machine. Baked Alaska The ice cream and sponge can be bought, but homemade elevates what is a good dessert into a very good one indeed. Both can be frozen until required, as can the finished dish. For the sponge 170g unsalted butter, softened 170g caster sugar 3 very fresh, large eggs Zest and juice of 1 lemon 170g self-raising flour, sifted For the vanilla ice cream 1 vanilla pod 60Oml milk 7 egg yolks 250g caster sugar 750ml double cream For the meringue 4 egg whites 85g caster sugar 4 tbsp apricot jam You'll need three roughly equal-sized rectangular vessels for this: a baking tin, for the sponge; a freezer container, for the ice cream; and a dish for the end-result. Make the sponge first. Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Lightly butter a sponge tin. Beat together the sugar and butter until pale. Crack the eggs into a jug, beat, and add in a slow stream to the butter/sugar mix. Beat in the lemon juice and rind, then fold in the flour. Put the batter in the tin, and bake for 25 minutes. Next, make the ice cream. Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds into a heavy-bottomed pan, drop in the pod and then pour in the milk. Place over a medium heat, and leave gently to infuse. In a large bowl, beat together the egg yolks and sugar, and, once the milk is scalded, pour it over this eggy mixture, stirring all the while. Pour back into the pot, return to the heat and stir constantly until the custard thickens and the bubbles on the surface disappear. Still stirring, pour in the cream, then leave to stand for an hour, so the vanilla flavour can fully permeate the cream. Strain and churn in an ice-cream machine. Scoop into the rectangular mould, and freeze. Now you're ready to assemble the baked Alaska. First, choose a suitable dish that will go happily from freezer to oven to table. Now make the meringue: beat in the egg whites until they are stiff but not dry, beat in half the sugar until stiff peaks are regained, then fold in the rest of the sugar. Spread a not-too-deep layer of meringue at the base of the dish. Cut the sponge in half horizontally, and spread apricot jam over one side of each piece. Lay a slice of sponge, jam-side up, on top of the meringue. Unmould the ice cream and place it as a block on top of the sponge. Place the second piece of sponge, jam-side down, on the ice cream, and then cover with meringue, making sure that it completely seals the cake. The Alaska will stay happily in the freezer until required. To cook, bake for six to eight minutes in a pre-heated oven at 230C/450F/gas mark 8, until golden in colour and flecked with little dark spots. Eat there and then \u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, London SE1.",

      "body": "<p>David Mamet's reputations precede him. There's the reluctant interviewee - tough, prickly, hates small talk, doesn't suffer fools gladly, doesn't suffer them at all. And there's the great writer - \"With Sam Shepard and Arthur Miller, he is one of the three greatest living American playwrights,\" says Patrick Marber, who directed The Old Neighborhood at the Royal Court in 1998 and is currently on tour in Mamet's Speed-the-Plow, written in the late 80s. \"Mamet brought a language to the stage that hadn't quite been there before, but he also brought with that language the classical beauty in his work. He's a classical writer.\" </p> <p>\"Everyone knows he's a great writer, but he's a great storyteller too,\" says William H Macy, who is playing Teach in the current Donmar Warehouse production of American Buffalo. \"When he first wrote Buffalo, what made me feel so proud was that he was writing in an American idiom and had found the beauty in it; it's just gorgeous - the metre and the rhythm, the music in this stuff - and he was the first writer who captured it.\" </p> <p>Over the past quarter-century, since American Buffalo made Mamet famous at the age of 28, the torrent of plays and - since the early 80s - movies, has been unstoppable. \"He goes into the men's room and comes out with a script,\" as one of his film collaborators puts it. </p> <p>The plays Glengarry Glen Ross, which won him a Pulitzer prize, Edmond, Speed-the-Plow, the controversial Oleanna, The Cryptogram (a highly personal play about a young boy losing his innocence in the face of domestic trauma) and The Old Neighborhood have made him the hottest ticket on Broadway and in London's West End. Screenplays for The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Verdict, The Untouchables, Hoffa, The Edge and Wag The Dog have established him as an A-list Hollywood screenwriter, and he has had success as a writer-director with House of Games, Homicide, The Spanish Prisoner and, last year, The Winslow Boy. </p> <p>His productivity is extraordinary: plays, movies, five collections of essays, books on acting and directing, poetry, children's books. Monday sees the publication of a new novel, Wilson, and his latest book of essays, Jafsie And John Henry; Mamet recently did a screenplay for the film of Thomas Harris's Hannibal (\"it was pretty good but the studio didn't think so and fired me\"); a new movie of his own called State And Main is in post-production; and he has finished the script for another movie to be shot in the autumn. How many Mamets are there? </p> <p>We have breakfast at Henrietta's Table near Harvard Square, close to his office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The restaurant's motto is \"fresh and honest\", which might serve for Mamet too. For the photograph, he sets his jaw and adopts what looks like a grimace. \"Smile\", says the photographer, \"this is a happy occasion.\" </p> <p>\"I am smiling,\" says Mamet. </p> <p>The journalist Minty Clinch once described Mamet as looking like a bulldog guarding its gate: you approach at your peril. The late Michael VerMeulen, former editor of GQ - a friend from Mamet's early theatre days in Chicago in the mid-70s - called him the \"Great Satan\" of the interview, and truly he despises the form. \"It's inherently a corrupt transaction,\" he says. </p> <p>Mamet will pronounce in general terms on art - he argues that the artist is responding to repression in society but, unlike the propagandist, expounds no theory, offers no solution. What he will not do is attempt to examine his own work. \"I'm paid to write things, not read them,\" he says pithily. </p> <p>He is not rude; indeed he is quite formal and punctilious in observing the pleasantries. But he is contemptuous of \"the interview\", the journalistic attempt to corner the artistic impulse. He is also averse to talking about his private life. \"I don't think your readers will want to know about my private life. That's just gossip.\" (This in response to an innocent question about whether he spends more time at his lovely house in a suburb of Boston or his even lovelier 100-acre farm in Vermont.) </p> <p>His new novel, said his wife, the Scottish actress Rebecca Pidgeon, was impenetrable; his agent, Andrew Wylie, said it was unpublishable. It is set hundreds of years into the future, when mankind has decamped to Mars. A computer crash has wiped out all knowledge of the past and a smug academic is trying to recreate it from fragmented sources, adding dodgy hypotheses to others' doctored histories. It is tragedy rendered as comedy, a very Mametian device; it is funny, provocative, and rather too self-conscious, the batteries of footnotes enumerating cod sources dimming after a while. </p> <p>Look for logic in the book and you are doomed to disappointment. \"Treat it as a modern-day Tristram Shandy,\" says his editor at Faber hopefully. \"His plays and films are accessible but in fiction he is a hardline modernist.\" The point of the book seems to be that scholarship is limited, truth partial and the past a barely audible Chinese whisper. </p> <p>The threat posed by the \"information age\" is a theme that surfaces repeatedly in his new collection of essays. \"I can envision no device more capable of spreading ignorance and illiteracy than the computer,\" he writes. \"It is, I think, like the atom bomb, a naturally evolved engine of oblivion, a sign, like the Tower of Babel, that civilisation has run its course.\" (Mamet continues to write on a typewriter; his office does not have e-mail; \"it's Victorian here\", says his assistant.) </p> <p>Mamet is, however, loath to agree that the arguments forcefully put in the essays are given fictional flesh in Wilson: \"It's just a bunch of stuff that I think is funny\", is his summing up of the novel. \"James Joyce,\" he adds, \"when asked what Finnegans Wake was about, said it's just about a bunch of Micks. I don't want to look for themes. It's like saying to Mark Rothko, 'I get it, you're trying to make a paint chart - a little bit of orange, a little bit of yellow...' \" </p> <p>There is a good deal of pessimism in the essays: in \"LA Homes\" he refers to \"the roadside crash which is our culture\"; in \"Why Don't You Write With A Computer\" he says \"television's mindless and interminable banality has made us stupid - unable to recognise, let alone understand, the simplest human interactions\". He comes on as grouchy, preachy, sometimes fogeyish in his dismissal of our foolishness and triviality. </p> <p>Is he happy? \"It's in my nature to be weak and complaining once in a while, and when that happens I try to remember to kick myself, or my wife remembers to kick me and says 'what, are you crazy?' Writing is so much better than working for a living, better than scrubbing floors.\" </p> <p>And he should know: when he was struggling to build a theatrical career in his early twenties, he took cleaning jobs, was a waiter, drove a taxi, worked in a junk shop (cue American Buffalo) and a real estate office (ditto Glengarry Glen Ross). Those plays depict masculine, intensely competitive worlds and the marginalisation of women in his plays has not been lost on critics. In Sexual Perversity In Chicago, men and women engage in mutually uncomprehending warfare, power games fuelled by fear and fast talk. In Speed-the-Plow, a close, joshing male friendship is threatened by the arrival of a strange, idealistic, faintly sinister woman. </p> <p>\"Men have a lot to learn from women,\" Mamet says in an essay called, simply, \"Women\" (which he says he wrote \"for a dare\"). Men are the puppydogs of the universe. Men will waste their time in pursuit of the utterly useless simply because their peers are all doing it. Women will not. They are legitimately goal-oriented, and their goals, for the most part, are simple: love, security, money, prestige. These are good, direct, meaningful goals, especially as opposed to the more male objectives of glory, acceptance, and being well-liked. Women don't give a tinker's damn about being well-liked, which means they don't know how to compromise.\" </p> <p>There are some dangerous sallies on the sex war in Mamet's essays. \"In husband-and-wife arguments, or, as they are generally known, 'marriage', the ultimate response the man feels is, of course, physical violence,\" he says in \"True Stories of Bitches\". (Bitchiness, which he raises to the status of an art form, is not gender-specific.) </p> <p>When Oleanna was premiered, sensationally, in 1992 at Harvard University - the home of American liberalism - Mamet admitted, it was \"like doing The Diary Of Anne Frank at Dachau\". The play concerns a young female student who, by falsely accusing her tutor of rape, destroys his career. The play hit every hot button - gender wars, political correctness, patriarchal power, academic freedom, male violence, feminist myopia - and audience reactions were almost unprecedented. Men tended to side with the tutor, women with the student. </p> <p>Mamet, true to form, refused to explain the play, though he did insist it was not inspired by the contemporaneous Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill sexual harassment case. Some refused to accept his claimed neutrality. \"Mr Mamet has never been known for being particularly sensitive to women's issues,\" wrote one American critic. \"Nor does he write particularly sympathetic female characters. But with Oleanna he has surely written his most misogynistic script yet.\" </p> <p>Mary McCann, who played the part of Carol in New York, defends him from feminist obloquy. \"The play isn't about a woman who's a villain and sets a man up. David thinks both characters are absolutely honest. We are so conditioned to having things neatly wrapped up that when it doesn't happen, people are outraged. Doing Oleanna, I was amazed at how different people's interpretations of what they saw were. There was outrage on all sides.\" </p> <p>It is true that Mamet's world - with its late-night poker, guns, knives, games-playing, japes and quotidian male stupidities - is fuelled by testosterone. \"Mamet's is a man's world and any woman in it has to recognise that,\" says Macy, referring principally to his fictional world. That doesn't mean that he automatically sides with men; he simply knows them and feels for their impotent swagger. </p> <p> Mamet likes to cast himself as undisciplined - he says he writes across so many genres because he is easily bored - but that may be dissimulation. His five-year-old daughter Clara is learning the violin by the Suzuki method, and he subscribes to Shinichi Suzuki's singlemindedness. \"If we get used to acting on every idea we have, our life becomes extremely full,\" Mamet says. \"If we replace the thought with the action, there's a recognition that the thought is meritless.\" </p> <p>He loves to work - \"he has to be building something\", says Macy. He adores the camaraderie and collective effort of the theatre and the film set. \"He walks in on the first day and knows everyone's name on the set,\" says film editor Barbara Tulliver. \"He appreciates people who do their job well.\" </p> <p>\"He's a master storyteller,\" she says. \"When he writes something he edits it down so there is no fat.\" He adopts the same approach with actors. \"He's a bit like Mussolini as a director,\" says Macy, who has known Mamet since Goddard College in the late 60s, where Mamet studied and later taught acting. \"His phrase is 'take it easy, you don't gotta do that', and it's frustrating sometimes, sometimes enraging. David will take away and take away, and what happens with many actors is that they basically give up. You've got to do what he says, but you can't give up. </p> <p>\"His view is that everything you need is on the page. A writer is not trying to trick his actors, he's not keeping back any vital information. So many actors have this attitude; 'it's a puzzle and we must solve this puzzle'. Dave's attitude is; 'this is not a puzzle, I'm telling you everything I know'.\" </p> <p>There is something rabbinical about Mamet, especially now that his beard is flecked with grey. The young foursquare theatrical lion of countless 80s photographs is being replaced by an older, more reflec tive figure. The temperature is around zero on this day in Boston, and he keeps his black beret on and the collar of his polo-neck sweater well up; he seems to have a slight crick in the neck. </p> <p>At 52, he is not old - still moves fast, still devours work and hearty breakfasts, can go 10 rounds with anyone - but the process of ageing seems to fascinate him. \"Looking At Fifty\" is the title of the first essay in the new collection, and the theme runs through the entire book. Essays, especially when they have previously appeared in magazines, can have a disparate feel to them, but this really is a book, given unity by the fact that they have all been written in the past five years, when Mamet has been making a mid-life reckoning, searching, as he says in the introduction, for a \"new model\". </p> <p>The essays are charming, wistful, funny, wise, the reflections of a man who has both read and lived, who can manage Homer and Hollywood. He writes plainly yet philosophically; his vision is both deep and wide; he makes you laugh hard and think harder. If Mamet in person is a studied act in negation, Mamet in his essays is a delightful and instructive read. </p> <p>He is master storyteller, able to pace a narrative to perfection; a lyrical writer too, capable of simple, direct, lovely prose; a careful observer;. a lover of language; a terrific wit: \"They say the definition of ambivalence is watching your mother-in-law drive over a cliff in your new Cadillac\"; and a master of the bitter Jewish joke: \"My people don't travel well - for the past thousand years we usually moved only because someone was trying to kill us.\" He is an object fetishist too - the Karmann Ghia sports car, the IBM Selectric typewriter, turtle-neck sweaters, guns, knives, caps, even that famously functional, sharply defining crew-cut - and an obsessive collector of most of the above. </p> <p>Above all, he is what all great writers are - a searcher for the real, an exposer of the artificial or corrupt, a truth-teller. The closing words of his pithy and provocative book on acting, True And False: Heresy And Common Sense For The Actor, could be taken as an epigraph for his entire literary under taking: \"What is true, what is false, what is finally important? It is not a sign of ignorance not to know the answers. But there is great merit in facing the questions.\" </p> <p>Mamet loathes artifice and is constantly comparing the earthy reality of Chicago with the Hollywood dreamworld. He venerates \"outdoors people\" - he is a keen hunter, but says his eyesight is too bad ever to hit anything - and hymns \"their reverence for knowledge and their understanding that knowledge lies not in the self but in the world around them\". He is simultaneously in awe of the world and fearful for its future: that produces a jangling tension in his writing. He unites opposites: then and now, optimism and pessimism, lyricism and aggression, beauty and ugliness. The way he writes about crooks and shysters is tinged with sympathy, finding music in the language of the streets. </p> <p>Macy puts this perfectly: \"He brought the language of the street on to the stage and on to film, but he didn't bring it in its ugliness, he brought it in its beauty. It is a thrill to speak because of the music.\" \"He's writing disjointed vernacular and you have to dig deep in order to learn it,\" says Mark Strong, who is appearing in Speed-The-Plow. Marber is keen to free Mamet from his public persona - as a streetwise writer producing fast, hard-boiled dialogue laced with four-letter words. \"He writes beautiful, lyrical speeches as well. He can write lyrical, poetic plays as well as the more regular, streety, vernacular plays, and I think Speed-the-Plow is a bit of both.\" </p> <p>Beauty and aggression characterise Mamet's work, just as they characterised his childhood in Chicago in the 50s. \"My childhood, like many people's, was not a bundle of laughs. So what? I always skip that part of the biography,\" he told John Lahr in 1997. </p> <p>Not quite always: the essay \"Five Mile Walk\" in Jafsie And John Henry, is wonderfully evocative of a wayward, romantic, innocent childhood: \"Now and then we would take the train into the city. We were interested in climbing and trespassing. We would climb the girders of a bridge. We would break into a building under construction and explore. We went to the museum, and spent a day walking the pediments, among the caryatids, 30 feet off the ground. When I was by myself I would spend the day in the city shoplifting.\" </p> <p>As a boy, Mamet was lonely, self-aware, alienated; he did poorly at school - he was endlessly told that he was not \"living up to his potential\" - and rebelled against the system, but he still read avidly, on his own terms. \"I would haunt the library. I'd walk the stacks - the floor was made of glass bricks, and they fascinated me. I'd find a likely-looking novel and read it in the big room, and find another, and read that, until it was time to return home.\" </p> <p>His parents divorced when he was 11 - \"we lived\", his sister Lynn told Lahr, \"in an emotional hurricane\" - and his mother quickly remarried. Mamet was very close to his father, Bernie, a quick-witted lawyer, whose linguistic exactitude his son inherited, but he disliked his stepfather, who had a violent temper. The aggression, verbal and physical, that punctuated his upbringing is echoed throughout Mamet's work: close relationships are war zones, words artillery shells, life a battle. Occasionally, the smoke clears to give moments of peace, epiphanies when all things seem possible. </p> <p>In his essay \"The Rake\", which appears in the collection The Cabin, Mamet lays bare the pain of his teenage years: his stepfather shattering a glass table in a fit of temper and blaming the children; his mother cutting her hands collecting the shards; an occasion when his sister was kept home from a school play - in which she had the lead role - because she was too excited to eat her meal; worst of all, a terrible incident where Mamet, in a fit of rage, threw a rake at his sister and badly cut her lip. His mother demanded to know what had happened and refused to take her to hospital until they had told her. \"So the family sat down to dinner, where my sister clutched a napkin to her face and the blood soaked the napkin and ran down on to her food, which she had to eat.\" </p> <p>At 15, Mamet grew tired of the war and went back to live with his father - \"the intense relationship of David's life\", according to the director Gregory Mosher, who directed many Mamet premieres. Lahr tells how at Bernie's funeral in 1991, Mamet insisted on burying his father himself, taking 40 minutes on a hot summer's day to finish the task. </p> <p>Mamet got involved with a theatre group in Chicago, then a centre of vibrant, pioneering drama, and immediately fell in love with the world. At 18, he went to Goddard College in Vermont, \"a hippy school where you got credits for taking drugs\", according to his close friend Jonathan Katz. \"He was there to get an education, so the rest of us found him a little disturbing.\" </p> <p>Mamet studied theatre and creative writing and, after graduating in 1969, taught acting in Vermont, co-founded the St Nicholas Theater Company in Chicago, and wrote Pinteresque sketches, the electrifying Sexual Perversity in Chicago (1974) and American Buffalo (1975), which proved his breakthrough play and led him to leave for New York the following year. </p> <p>Sexual Perversity in Chicago was later made into a movie, called About Last Night. Mamet's screenplay was butchered and what eventually emerged was dross that left him feeling embittered. Speed-the-Plow can in part be read as an act of revenge. His dealings with Hollywood have always been slightly arm's length; he has no home on the west coast and pokes fun at it in the essay LA Homes, as well as in his new movie State And Main, where a film crew takes over a US town. </p> <p> How do the occupants of those lavish LA homes feel about this hi-falutin' easterner's jibes? \"Hollywood is uninsultable,\" says producer Art Linson, who worked with Mamet on The Untouchables. \"It's all about money. Hollywood will not feel insulted by him as long as he makes money. If you stop making money and then insult them, it can be very thin-skinned. If Tom Hanks had a few harsh words to say about Hollywood, they'd live with it. Mamet is still in credit, though not as much as Tom Hanks, naturally.\" </p> <p>Linson says Mamet \"has tended to write big movies and direct small ones. He has done mainstream movies and maverick projects - films that have made money and films that haven't made money. He hasn't directed a blockbuster yet, but then he hasn't had any blockbuster budgets.\" </p> <p>Michael Hausman, who produced House Of Games, Things Change, and Homicide, makes a similar point: \"He gets his price as a screenwriter but he doesn't get his price as a screenwriter-director. His subject matter is not really Hollywood material when he's writing for himself. People would probably only risk $10m-$20m on one of his films - a crazy amount in any other business but not in Hollywood - but for other people he can write big.\" </p> <p>Hausman offers a character assessment that is common among those who have worked with him: \"He knows what he wants and he gets what he wants. He's very good with actors and with crew members; he's loyal to people and trusts you if you do your job. When you buy David, you buy his mouth, you buy his words. He's not easy but he's worth it - that's how I would sum him up.\" </p> <p>Mamet married Rebecca Pidgeon in 1991. They had met when she appeared in Speed-The-Plow at the National Theatre in 1989. Mamet's first marriage, to the feisty New York actress Lindsay Crouse, with whom he had two daughters, had broken down, and the relationship with Pidgeon has given him what Lahr called \"a new mellowness\". </p> <p>\"She had a tremendous effect in anchoring him, in calming him down, in making him feel it's OK to be scared, it's OK to be upset, it's OK to fail,\" his sister Lynn has said. \"I think she has allowed my brother to exhale for the first time in his life.\" </p> <p>\"When I first saw Dave, when he came over to England to direct Speed-the-Plow, it was quite a shock for me,\" Pidgeon said last year. \"I was expecting an Arthur Miller, and there he was, with his little scarf tied nattily around his neck like some Parisian mime artist. He looked younger than I thought he was going to, and I couldn't understand how such a young person could have written all this work. He is approachable, but a little intimidating at first. He has a reputation for being tough, but not with actors - with producers. </p> <p>\"When he is working at home, he has to have a lot of time alone, a lot of dreaming time. He is supportive, though. When I joined him there [in the US], I had to start all over again. That was scary, because I had left a thriving career. Being married to Dave turned out to be quite damaging to my career. People thought of me as some wife; my acting credits did not mean anything. But Dave really loves my acting, God bless him, and that helped.\" Mamet and Pidgeon have two children - Clara and one-year-old Noah. </p> <p>Mamet, in a rare excursion into personal territory, said: \"Rebecca is a very honest and straightforward and self-confident actress. It is not that I am particularly idealistic about women, but Rebecca happens to be as admirable a person on stage as she is in life. My sister has said that my writing for women characters has improved, or changed, since I have been close to Rebecca, but you should remember that my sister also said President Roosevelt is alive and well and living in Argentina. I think the only thing that has changed about my writing over the years is my typing, which has got a lot worse.\" </p> <p>His refusal to align life with art is typical, and legitimate - artists reject such crude reductionism. But it is tempting to see his marriage to Pidgeon in 1991 and the death of his father in the same year as turning points. His latest essays are reflective and very personal; he turned to novel-writing - The Village (1994), The Old Religion (1997) and now Wilson; he has become both more religious and more overtly Jewish in outlook. </p> <p>\"He is deeply religious,\" says Macy, \"and his rabbi is one of his closest friends.\" He lives in Newton, a suburb of Boston which has a large Jewish community. \"I notice that the Boston Globe refers to him these days as the Newton writer,\" says his friend Jonathan Wilson. \"He seems to enjoy the sense of community. He has been happier in the past 10 years than previously.\" </p> <p>In an essay 15 years ago, Mamet wrote: \"I have always felt that people look on me as an outcast. I have always felt like an outsider; and I am sure that the suspicion that I perceive is the suspicion that I provoke by my great longing to belong [his emphasis]. </p> <p>\"As the children of immigrant Jews, we are spurred in our need to observe by the memory of old humiliations, of old indignities_ Trained not to assimilate, we have found useless the virtues of compromise with our environment... True to our past, we live and work with an inherited, observed, and accepted vision of personal futility, and of the beauty of the world.\" </p> <p>As a young man, Mamet tried - shades of Melville - to get a berth on a ship. His attempt to escape failed and he took shelter in the theatre, a surrogate home. Now he has a real home, an adored family, a close-knit community; perhaps at last he feels he belongs. Much of what he writes is deeply pessimistic - in Wilson he envisages a world without knowledge or wonder or truth - but his warnings show that he cares passionately. He chides us not from rage, but from love. </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: David Alan Mamet </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> November 30 1947, Chicago. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Goddard College, Vermont (BA Eng lit 1969). </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1977 Lindsay Crouse (two daughters), marriage dissolved; 1991 Rebecca Pidgeon (one daughter, one son). </p> <p><strong> Plays include: </strong> Sexual Perversity In Chicago (1974); American Buffalo (1975); Glengarry Glen Ross (1983); Speed-the-Plow (1988); Oleanna (1992); The Cryptogram (1995); Boston Marriage (1999). </p> <p><strong> Films</strong> <strong> (as writer/director):</strong> House Of Games (1987); Things Change (1988); Homicide (1991); Oleanna (1994); The Spanish Prisoner (1997); The Winslow Boy (1999); State and Main (2000). </p> <p><strong> Films (as writer) include: </strong> The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981); The Untouchables (1987); Hoffa (1992); Oleanna (1994); American Buffalo (1996); Wag The Dog (1997). </p> <p><strong> Fiction: </strong> The Village (1994); The Old Religion (1997);Wilson (2000). </p> <p>\u0095 David Mamet talks about his life and work with Howard Jacobson tonight at 7.30pm in the Purcell Room, South Bank, London SE1 (details: 0171-960 4242; returns only).

      "bodyText": "David Mamet's reputations precede him. There's the reluctant interviewee - tough, prickly, hates small talk, doesn't suffer fools gladly, doesn't suffer them at all. And there's the great writer - \"With Sam Shepard and Arthur Miller, he is one of the three greatest living American playwrights,\" says Patrick Marber, who directed The Old Neighborhood at the Royal Court in 1998 and is currently on tour in Mamet's Speed-the-Plow, written in the late 80s. \"Mamet brought a language to the stage that hadn't quite been there before, but he also brought with that language the classical beauty in his work. He's a classical writer.\" \"Everyone knows he's a great writer, but he's a great storyteller too,\" says William H Macy, who is playing Teach in the current Donmar Warehouse production of American Buffalo. \"When he first wrote Buffalo, what made me feel so proud was that he was writing in an American idiom and had found the beauty in it; it's just gorgeous - the metre and the rhythm, the music in this stuff - and he was the first writer who captured it.\" Over the past quarter-century, since American Buffalo made Mamet famous at the age of 28, the torrent of plays and - since the early 80s - movies, has been unstoppable. \"He goes into the men's room and comes out with a script,\" as one of his film collaborators puts it. The plays Glengarry Glen Ross, which won him a Pulitzer prize, Edmond, Speed-the-Plow, the controversial Oleanna, The Cryptogram (a highly personal play about a young boy losing his innocence in the face of domestic trauma) and The Old Neighborhood have made him the hottest ticket on Broadway and in London's West End. Screenplays for The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Verdict, The Untouchables, Hoffa, The Edge and Wag The Dog have established him as an A-list Hollywood screenwriter, and he has had success as a writer-director with House of Games, Homicide, The Spanish Prisoner and, last year, The Winslow Boy. His productivity is extraordinary: plays, movies, five collections of essays, books on acting and directing, poetry, children's books. Monday sees the publication of a new novel, Wilson, and his latest book of essays, Jafsie And John Henry; Mamet recently did a screenplay for the film of Thomas Harris's Hannibal (\"it was pretty good but the studio didn't think so and fired me\"); a new movie of his own called State And Main is in post-production; and he has finished the script for another movie to be shot in the autumn. How many Mamets are there? We have breakfast at Henrietta's Table near Harvard Square, close to his office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The restaurant's motto is \"fresh and honest\", which might serve for Mamet too. For the photograph, he sets his jaw and adopts what looks like a grimace. \"Smile\", says the photographer, \"this is a happy occasion.\" \"I am smiling,\" says Mamet. The journalist Minty Clinch once described Mamet as looking like a bulldog guarding its gate: you approach at your peril. The late Michael VerMeulen, former editor of GQ - a friend from Mamet's early theatre days in Chicago in the mid-70s - called him the \"Great Satan\" of the interview, and truly he despises the form. \"It's inherently a corrupt transaction,\" he says. Mamet will pronounce in general terms on art - he argues that the artist is responding to repression in society but, unlike the propagandist, expounds no theory, offers no solution. What he will not do is attempt to examine his own work. \"I'm paid to write things, not read them,\" he says pithily. He is not rude; indeed he is quite formal and punctilious in observing the pleasantries. But he is contemptuous of \"the interview\", the journalistic attempt to corner the artistic impulse. He is also averse to talking about his private life. \"I don't think your readers will want to know about my private life. That's just gossip.\" (This in response to an innocent question about whether he spends more time at his lovely house in a suburb of Boston or his even lovelier 100-acre farm in Vermont.) His new novel, said his wife, the Scottish actress Rebecca Pidgeon, was impenetrable; his agent, Andrew Wylie, said it was unpublishable. It is set hundreds of years into the future, when mankind has decamped to Mars. A computer crash has wiped out all knowledge of the past and a smug academic is trying to recreate it from fragmented sources, adding dodgy hypotheses to others' doctored histories. It is tragedy rendered as comedy, a very Mametian device; it is funny, provocative, and rather too self-conscious, the batteries of footnotes enumerating cod sources dimming after a while. Look for logic in the book and you are doomed to disappointment. \"Treat it as a modern-day Tristram Shandy,\" says his editor at Faber hopefully. \"His plays and films are accessible but in fiction he is a hardline modernist.\" The point of the book seems to be that scholarship is limited, truth partial and the past a barely audible Chinese whisper. The threat posed by the \"information age\" is a theme that surfaces repeatedly in his new collection of essays. \"I can envision no device more capable of spreading ignorance and illiteracy than the computer,\" he writes. \"It is, I think, like the atom bomb, a naturally evolved engine of oblivion, a sign, like the Tower of Babel, that civilisation has run its course.\" (Mamet continues to write on a typewriter; his office does not have e-mail; \"it's Victorian here\", says his assistant.) Mamet is, however, loath to agree that the arguments forcefully put in the essays are given fictional flesh in Wilson: \"It's just a bunch of stuff that I think is funny\", is his summing up of the novel. \"James Joyce,\" he adds, \"when asked what Finnegans Wake was about, said it's just about a bunch of Micks. I don't want to look for themes. It's like saying to Mark Rothko, 'I get it, you're trying to make a paint chart - a little bit of orange, a little bit of yellow...' \" There is a good deal of pessimism in the essays: in \"LA Homes\" he refers to \"the roadside crash which is our culture\"; in \"Why Don't You Write With A Computer\" he says \"television's mindless and interminable banality has made us stupid - unable to recognise, let alone understand, the simplest human interactions\". He comes on as grouchy, preachy, sometimes fogeyish in his dismissal of our foolishness and triviality. Is he happy? \"It's in my nature to be weak and complaining once in a while, and when that happens I try to remember to kick myself, or my wife remembers to kick me and says 'what, are you crazy?' Writing is so much better than working for a living, better than scrubbing floors.\" And he should know: when he was struggling to build a theatrical career in his early twenties, he took cleaning jobs, was a waiter, drove a taxi, worked in a junk shop (cue American Buffalo) and a real estate office (ditto Glengarry Glen Ross). Those plays depict masculine, intensely competitive worlds and the marginalisation of women in his plays has not been lost on critics. In Sexual Perversity In Chicago, men and women engage in mutually uncomprehending warfare, power games fuelled by fear and fast talk. In Speed-the-Plow, a close, joshing male friendship is threatened by the arrival of a strange, idealistic, faintly sinister woman. \"Men have a lot to learn from women,\" Mamet says in an essay called, simply, \"Women\" (which he says he wrote \"for a dare\"). Men are the puppydogs of the universe. Men will waste their time in pursuit of the utterly useless simply because their peers are all doing it. Women will not. They are legitimately goal-oriented, and their goals, for the most part, are simple: love, security, money, prestige. These are good, direct, meaningful goals, especially as opposed to the more male objectives of glory, acceptance, and being well-liked. Women don't give a tinker's damn about being well-liked, which means they don't know how to compromise.\" There are some dangerous sallies on the sex war in Mamet's essays. \"In husband-and-wife arguments, or, as they are generally known, 'marriage', the ultimate response the man feels is, of course, physical violence,\" he says in \"True Stories of Bitches\". (Bitchiness, which he raises to the status of an art form, is not gender-specific.) When Oleanna was premiered, sensationally, in 1992 at Harvard University - the home of American liberalism - Mamet admitted, it was \"like doing The Diary Of Anne Frank at Dachau\". The play concerns a young female student who, by falsely accusing her tutor of rape, destroys his career. The play hit every hot button - gender wars, political correctness, patriarchal power, academic freedom, male violence, feminist myopia - and audience reactions were almost unprecedented. Men tended to side with the tutor, women with the student. Mamet, true to form, refused to explain the play, though he did insist it was not inspired by the contemporaneous Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill sexual harassment case. Some refused to accept his claimed neutrality. \"Mr Mamet has never been known for being particularly sensitive to women's issues,\" wrote one American critic. \"Nor does he write particularly sympathetic female characters. But with Oleanna he has surely written his most misogynistic script yet.\" Mary McCann, who played the part of Carol in New York, defends him from feminist obloquy. \"The play isn't about a woman who's a villain and sets a man up. David thinks both characters are absolutely honest. We are so conditioned to having things neatly wrapped up that when it doesn't happen, people are outraged. Doing Oleanna, I was amazed at how different people's interpretations of what they saw were. There was outrage on all sides.\" It is true that Mamet's world - with its late-night poker, guns, knives, games-playing, japes and quotidian male stupidities - is fuelled by testosterone. \"Mamet's is a man's world and any woman in it has to recognise that,\" says Macy, referring principally to his fictional world. That doesn't mean that he automatically sides with men; he simply knows them and feels for their impotent swagger. Mamet likes to cast himself as undisciplined - he says he writes across so many genres because he is easily bored - but that may be dissimulation. His five-year-old daughter Clara is learning the violin by the Suzuki method, and he subscribes to Shinichi Suzuki's singlemindedness. \"If we get used to acting on every idea we have, our life becomes extremely full,\" Mamet says. \"If we replace the thought with the action, there's a recognition that the thought is meritless.\" He loves to work - \"he has to be building something\", says Macy. He adores the camaraderie and collective effort of the theatre and the film set. \"He walks in on the first day and knows everyone's name on the set,\" says film editor Barbara Tulliver. \"He appreciates people who do their job well.\" \"He's a master storyteller,\" she says. \"When he writes something he edits it down so there is no fat.\" He adopts the same approach with actors. \"He's a bit like Mussolini as a director,\" says Macy, who has known Mamet since Goddard College in the late 60s, where Mamet studied and later taught acting. \"His phrase is 'take it easy, you don't gotta do that', and it's frustrating sometimes, sometimes enraging. David will take away and take away, and what happens with many actors is that they basically give up. You've got to do what he says, but you can't give up. \"His view is that everything you need is on the page. A writer is not trying to trick his actors, he's not keeping back any vital information. So many actors have this attitude; 'it's a puzzle and we must solve this puzzle'. Dave's attitude is; 'this is not a puzzle, I'm telling you everything I know'.\" There is something rabbinical about Mamet, especially now that his beard is flecked with grey. The young foursquare theatrical lion of countless 80s photographs is being replaced by an older, more reflec tive figure. The temperature is around zero on this day in Boston, and he keeps his black beret on and the collar of his polo-neck sweater well up; he seems to have a slight crick in the neck. At 52, he is not old - still moves fast, still devours work and hearty breakfasts, can go 10 rounds with anyone - but the process of ageing seems to fascinate him. \"Looking At Fifty\" is the title of the first essay in the new collection, and the theme runs through the entire book. Essays, especially when they have previously appeared in magazines, can have a disparate feel to them, but this really is a book, given unity by the fact that they have all been written in the past five years, when Mamet has been making a mid-life reckoning, searching, as he says in the introduction, for a \"new model\". The essays are charming, wistful, funny, wise, the reflections of a man who has both read and lived, who can manage Homer and Hollywood. He writes plainly yet philosophically; his vision is both deep and wide; he makes you laugh hard and think harder. If Mamet in person is a studied act in negation, Mamet in his essays is a delightful and instructive read. He is master storyteller, able to pace a narrative to perfection; a lyrical writer too, capable of simple, direct, lovely prose; a careful observer;. a lover of language; a terrific wit: \"They say the definition of ambivalence is watching your mother-in-law drive over a cliff in your new Cadillac\"; and a master of the bitter Jewish joke: \"My people don't travel well - for the past thousand years we usually moved only because someone was trying to kill us.\" He is an object fetishist too - the Karmann Ghia sports car, the IBM Selectric typewriter, turtle-neck sweaters, guns, knives, caps, even that famously functional, sharply defining crew-cut - and an obsessive collector of most of the above. Above all, he is what all great writers are - a searcher for the real, an exposer of the artificial or corrupt, a truth-teller. The closing words of his pithy and provocative book on acting, True And False: Heresy And Common Sense For The Actor, could be taken as an epigraph for his entire literary under taking: \"What is true, what is false, what is finally important? It is not a sign of ignorance not to know the answers. But there is great merit in facing the questions.\" Mamet loathes artifice and is constantly comparing the earthy reality of Chicago with the Hollywood dreamworld. He venerates \"outdoors people\" - he is a keen hunter, but says his eyesight is too bad ever to hit anything - and hymns \"their reverence for knowledge and their understanding that knowledge lies not in the self but in the world around them\". He is simultaneously in awe of the world and fearful for its future: that produces a jangling tension in his writing. He unites opposites: then and now, optimism and pessimism, lyricism and aggression, beauty and ugliness. The way he writes about crooks and shysters is tinged with sympathy, finding music in the language of the streets. Macy puts this perfectly: \"He brought the language of the street on to the stage and on to film, but he didn't bring it in its ugliness, he brought it in its beauty. It is a thrill to speak because of the music.\" \"He's writing disjointed vernacular and you have to dig deep in order to learn it,\" says Mark Strong, who is appearing in Speed-The-Plow. Marber is keen to free Mamet from his public persona - as a streetwise writer producing fast, hard-boiled dialogue laced with four-letter words. \"He writes beautiful, lyrical speeches as well. He can write lyrical, poetic plays as well as the more regular, streety, vernacular plays, and I think Speed-the-Plow is a bit of both.\" Beauty and aggression characterise Mamet's work, just as they characterised his childhood in Chicago in the 50s. \"My childhood, like many people's, was not a bundle of laughs. So what? I always skip that part of the biography,\" he told John Lahr in 1997. Not quite always: the essay \"Five Mile Walk\" in Jafsie And John Henry, is wonderfully evocative of a wayward, romantic, innocent childhood: \"Now and then we would take the train into the city. We were interested in climbing and trespassing. We would climb the girders of a bridge. We would break into a building under construction and explore. We went to the museum, and spent a day walking the pediments, among the caryatids, 30 feet off the ground. When I was by myself I would spend the day in the city shoplifting.\" As a boy, Mamet was lonely, self-aware, alienated; he did poorly at school - he was endlessly told that he was not \"living up to his potential\" - and rebelled against the system, but he still read avidly, on his own terms. \"I would haunt the library. I'd walk the stacks - the floor was made of glass bricks, and they fascinated me. I'd find a likely-looking novel and read it in the big room, and find another, and read that, until it was time to return home.\" His parents divorced when he was 11 - \"we lived\", his sister Lynn told Lahr, \"in an emotional hurricane\" - and his mother quickly remarried. Mamet was very close to his father, Bernie, a quick-witted lawyer, whose linguistic exactitude his son inherited, but he disliked his stepfather, who had a violent temper. The aggression, verbal and physical, that punctuated his upbringing is echoed throughout Mamet's work: close relationships are war zones, words artillery shells, life a battle. Occasionally, the smoke clears to give moments of peace, epiphanies when all things seem possible. In his essay \"The Rake\", which appears in the collection The Cabin, Mamet lays bare the pain of his teenage years: his stepfather shattering a glass table in a fit of temper and blaming the children; his mother cutting her hands collecting the shards; an occasion when his sister was kept home from a school play - in which she had the lead role - because she was too excited to eat her meal; worst of all, a terrible incident where Mamet, in a fit of rage, threw a rake at his sister and badly cut her lip. His mother demanded to know what had happened and refused to take her to hospital until they had told her. \"So the family sat down to dinner, where my sister clutched a napkin to her face and the blood soaked the napkin and ran down on to her food, which she had to eat.\" At 15, Mamet grew tired of the war and went back to live with his father - \"the intense relationship of David's life\", according to the director Gregory Mosher, who directed many Mamet premieres. Lahr tells how at Bernie's funeral in 1991, Mamet insisted on burying his father himself, taking 40 minutes on a hot summer's day to finish the task. Mamet got involved with a theatre group in Chicago, then a centre of vibrant, pioneering drama, and immediately fell in love with the world. At 18, he went to Goddard College in Vermont, \"a hippy school where you got credits for taking drugs\", according to his close friend Jonathan Katz. \"He was there to get an education, so the rest of us found him a little disturbing.\" Mamet studied theatre and creative writing and, after graduating in 1969, taught acting in Vermont, co-founded the St Nicholas Theater Company in Chicago, and wrote Pinteresque sketches, the electrifying Sexual Perversity in Chicago (1974) and American Buffalo (1975), which proved his breakthrough play and led him to leave for New York the following year. Sexual Perversity in Chicago was later made into a movie, called About Last Night. Mamet's screenplay was butchered and what eventually emerged was dross that left him feeling embittered. Speed-the-Plow can in part be read as an act of revenge. His dealings with Hollywood have always been slightly arm's length; he has no home on the west coast and pokes fun at it in the essay LA Homes, as well as in his new movie State And Main, where a film crew takes over a US town. How do the occupants of those lavish LA homes feel about this hi-falutin' easterner's jibes? \"Hollywood is uninsultable,\" says producer Art Linson, who worked with Mamet on The Untouchables. \"It's all about money. Hollywood will not feel insulted by him as long as he makes money. If you stop making money and then insult them, it can be very thin-skinned. If Tom Hanks had a few harsh words to say about Hollywood, they'd live with it. Mamet is still in credit, though not as much as Tom Hanks, naturally.\" Linson says Mamet \"has tended to write big movies and direct small ones. He has done mainstream movies and maverick projects - films that have made money and films that haven't made money. He hasn't directed a blockbuster yet, but then he hasn't had any blockbuster budgets.\" Michael Hausman, who produced House Of Games, Things Change, and Homicide, makes a similar point: \"He gets his price as a screenwriter but he doesn't get his price as a screenwriter-director. His subject matter is not really Hollywood material when he's writing for himself. People would probably only risk $10m-$20m on one of his films - a crazy amount in any other business but not in Hollywood - but for other people he can write big.\" Hausman offers a character assessment that is common among those who have worked with him: \"He knows what he wants and he gets what he wants. He's very good with actors and with crew members; he's loyal to people and trusts you if you do your job. When you buy David, you buy his mouth, you buy his words. He's not easy but he's worth it - that's how I would sum him up.\" Mamet married Rebecca Pidgeon in 1991. They had met when she appeared in Speed-The-Plow at the National Theatre in 1989. Mamet's first marriage, to the feisty New York actress Lindsay Crouse, with whom he had two daughters, had broken down, and the relationship with Pidgeon has given him what Lahr called \"a new mellowness\". \"She had a tremendous effect in anchoring him, in calming him down, in making him feel it's OK to be scared, it's OK to be upset, it's OK to fail,\" his sister Lynn has said. \"I think she has allowed my brother to exhale for the first time in his life.\" \"When I first saw Dave, when he came over to England to direct Speed-the-Plow, it was quite a shock for me,\" Pidgeon said last year. \"I was expecting an Arthur Miller, and there he was, with his little scarf tied nattily around his neck like some Parisian mime artist. He looked younger than I thought he was going to, and I couldn't understand how such a young person could have written all this work. He is approachable, but a little intimidating at first. He has a reputation for being tough, but not with actors - with producers. \"When he is working at home, he has to have a lot of time alone, a lot of dreaming time. He is supportive, though. When I joined him there [in the US], I had to start all over again. That was scary, because I had left a thriving career. Being married to Dave turned out to be quite damaging to my career. People thought of me as some wife; my acting credits did not mean anything. But Dave really loves my acting, God bless him, and that helped.\" Mamet and Pidgeon have two children - Clara and one-year-old Noah. Mamet, in a rare excursion into personal territory, said: \"Rebecca is a very honest and straightforward and self-confident actress. It is not that I am particularly idealistic about women, but Rebecca happens to be as admirable a person on stage as she is in life. My sister has said that my writing for women characters has improved, or changed, since I have been close to Rebecca, but you should remember that my sister also said President Roosevelt is alive and well and living in Argentina. I think the only thing that has changed about my writing over the years is my typing, which has got a lot worse.\" His refusal to align life with art is typical, and legitimate - artists reject such crude reductionism. But it is tempting to see his marriage to Pidgeon in 1991 and the death of his father in the same year as turning points. His latest essays are reflective and very personal; he turned to novel-writing - The Village (1994), The Old Religion (1997) and now Wilson; he has become both more religious and more overtly Jewish in outlook. \"He is deeply religious,\" says Macy, \"and his rabbi is one of his closest friends.\" He lives in Newton, a suburb of Boston which has a large Jewish community. \"I notice that the Boston Globe refers to him these days as the Newton writer,\" says his friend Jonathan Wilson. \"He seems to enjoy the sense of community. He has been happier in the past 10 years than previously.\" In an essay 15 years ago, Mamet wrote: \"I have always felt that people look on me as an outcast. I have always felt like an outsider; and I am sure that the suspicion that I perceive is the suspicion that I provoke by my great longing to belong [his emphasis]. \"As the children of immigrant Jews, we are spurred in our need to observe by the memory of old humiliations, of old indignities_ Trained not to assimilate, we have found useless the virtues of compromise with our environment... True to our past, we live and work with an inherited, observed, and accepted vision of personal futility, and of the beauty of the world.\" As a young man, Mamet tried - shades of Melville - to get a berth on a ship. His attempt to escape failed and he took shelter in the theatre, a surrogate home. Now he has a real home, an adored family, a close-knit community; perhaps at last he feels he belongs. Much of what he writes is deeply pessimistic - in Wilson he envisages a world without knowledge or wonder or truth - but his warnings show that he cares passionately. He chides us not from rage, but from love. Life at a glance: David Alan Mamet Born: November 30 1947, Chicago. Education: Goddard College, Vermont (BA Eng lit 1969).

Most of the time we add heat to the food, but there are also occasions when we subtract it - why not call that cooking, too? </p> <p>The classic example of this form of cooking is the frozen dessert, such as sorbet and ice cream, both of which begin life as a flavoured liquid. In sorbets, the flavour is dissolved in water; ice creams, meanwhile, also have droplets of milk fat present, and some of the flavour is dissolved in these. Both contain sugar, and sometimes alcohol, too. </p> <p>The presence of these additives is not incidental; it is essential. When we freeze a sorbet or ice cream, ice crystals grow from the water inside. These crystals are absolutely pure, frozen water. The sugar, flavourings and other water-soluble ingredients, such as alcohol, remain dissolved in what liquid is left, forming a more and more concentrated solution as more of the water turns to ice. Eventually, you end up with a slush of pure ice crystals in a very concentrated, flavoured sugar solution. </p> <p>This is where the sugar and other water-soluble ingredients play their vital role. The more concentrated the solution gets, the lower its freezing point becomes. In fact, the solution becomes unfreezeable at domestic freezer temperatures (just as gin does, because of its high concentration of alcohol), and serves as a liquid lubricant that stops the ice crystals from sticking together. </p> <p>Sorbets tend to be slightly acidic, usually from added fruit juices, and so are often used to clear the palate between courses, though scientifically there is still some way to go before we fully understand why that is. Ice creams, however, are generally sweeter, and have a very different texture due to the presence of milk fats and air bubbles, along with the ice crystals. The texture of an ice cream will depend particularly on the size of these crystals - the larger they are, the grittier the ice cream will feel to the tongue. And the size of the crystals is determined by the speed at which they are formed - the faster they are formed, the smaller they are and the smoother the ice cream becomes. </p> <p>The ultimate ice cream can be made by freezing a basic ice-cream mixture not in a freezer but by pouring liquid nitrogen into it. This is because liquid nitrogen has a temperature of less than -180C, whereas domestic freezers can manage only -18C - of course, we would not recommend trying this outside a proper laboratory, but it does make the most deliciously smooth ice cream, and also provides a spectacular display of white clouds billowing over the table, to boot. </p> <p>Frozen desserts are not the only way in which freezing is used in food preparation. Many foods are frozen for long-term storage, for example, where the freezing process is used to slow down or even stop bacterial growth, and some are frozen to make them easier to handle. Bacon, for one, is far easier to slice when frozen that at room temperature; and the American chef Fritz Blank has even been known to freeze a fillet steak, go over it with a blowtorch, leave it to thaw and then cook it in the normal way. The result is juicily delicious. </p> <p>Primarily, though, we use freezing to create ice crystals that add to the impact of a food or drink. This is one reason why the frozen margarita is so popular, for the alcohol ensures that part of the drink remains unfrozen, which means the concentrated alcohol solution blends pleasantly with the melting ice crystals in the mouth. As with sorbets and ice creams, there is enough unfrozen liquid to let the ice crystals slide past each other and not stick together in a lump. They can be made to stick together, however, so producing the harder frozen confections that some prefer, by lowering the temperature further, or by reducing the sugar or alcohol content.

(Nb rewrite lame phrase \"go about things\", perhaps by quoting DFW himself, who sees such jiggery-pokery as an attempt to \"salvage the aesthetic disaster\".) </p> <p>Toy with notion of writing review in same fashion. </p> <p>Wonder aloud whether DFW's methods are more than just an attempt to avoid becoming trapped in his very idiosyncratic - not to mention horribly infectious - style. Wonder too whether writing things up as notes, overheard transcripts, etc, reflects and tacitly comments on the fractured state of the restless Western mind and the tendency of depressed people's thought processes to move endlessly but fruitlessly in paranoid, self-fulfilling circularity. Not to mention whether we should worry about these things as much as he clearly does, or pretends to. </p> <p>Do lit. name drop, eg John Barth, Calvino, Gaddis etc, not so much for purposes of serious comparison as to assure anyone who has got this far that, yes, reviewer is aware of such influences/reference points, but shy away from question as to whether DFW is in fact doing anything so radically different after all. Imply that cursory nature of lit. name dropping is not laziness but a matter of space and the desire to avoid an extremely tedious debate best left to teachers of creative writing and their students. </p> <p>Cite the story \"Adult World\", divided into parts I and II, I being a reasonably straightforward tale of a newlywed woman's insecurities w/r/t her love life, II being DFW's own notes for its conclusion. Wife comes to realise that husband is chronic compulsive masturbator, and wonders whether there is a support group for wives of CCMs. Text reads: \"'MastAnon?' 'Co-Jack?'

      "bodyText": "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men by David Foster Wallace 273pp, Abacus, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL Begin by outlining one facet of David Foster Wallace's dilemma: the perceived impossibility of fictional honesty with regard to - w/r/t, to adopt his shorthand - inner states, literary history, acute self-consciousness (not so acute as to prevent him from writing reams and reams of prose), leading to highly problematic relationship with presentation/style if one is both conscientious and talented writer, which DFW clearly is. Add, by way of cheap laugh masquerading as substantiation, how cosy notion of standard short story form, as typified by countless hackneyed examples in, eg, The New Yorker, has become unworkable, not to mention downright pain in neck, leading to sterility/impasse or, for whatever reasons (sheer old-fashioned but none the less urgent need to express?), stylistic games, eg pretending that story has broken down and so offering up what profess to be the writer's raw unmediated notes instead of a conclusion. Note one \"story\" in Brief Interviews going so far as to posit dilemma of writer embarked on said story but now hopelessly bogged down and so, with characteristic footnotes so audaciously prolix that at times the narrative itself exists on the page merely as a thin crust over a massive block of small print, asking reader straight out if this is really the way to go about things. (Nb rewrite lame phrase \"go about things\", perhaps by quoting DFW himself, who sees such jiggery-pokery as an attempt to \"salvage the aesthetic disaster\".) Toy with notion of writing review in same fashion. Wonder aloud whether DFW's methods are more than just an attempt to avoid becoming trapped in his very idiosyncratic - not to mention horribly infectious - style. Wonder too whether writing things up as notes, overheard transcripts, etc, reflects and tacitly comments on the fractured state of the restless Western mind and the tendency of depressed people's thought processes to move endlessly but fruitlessly in paranoid, self-fulfilling circularity. Not to mention whether we should worry about these things as much as he clearly does, or pretends to. Do lit. name drop, eg John Barth, Calvino, Gaddis etc, not so much for purposes of serious comparison as to assure anyone who has got this far that, yes, reviewer is aware of such influences/reference points, but shy away from question as to whether DFW is in fact doing anything so radically different after all. Imply that cursory nature of lit. name dropping is not laziness but a matter of space and the desire to avoid an extremely tedious debate best left to teachers of creative writing and their students. Cite the story \"Adult World\", divided into parts I and II, I being a reasonably straightforward tale of a newlywed woman's insecurities w/r/t her love life, II being DFW's own notes for its conclusion. Wife comes to realise that husband is chronic compulsive masturbator, and wonders whether there is a support group for wives of CCMs. Text reads: \"'MastAnon?' 'Co-Jack?' (Nb avoid easy gags.)\" Thereby DFW makes easy gag while at same time deferring responsibility for it, ie has metafictional cake and eats it, hoping actual comedy of intranarrative acknowledgment, much like screen comedian turning helplessly to camera, will save bacon. Mention curious fact that one can't read DFW's work when stoned, despite not only author's resemblance to pothead (unshaven, Axl Rose-style bandanna, numerous refs in fiction to dope or \"pot\" as Americans still call it) but also the huge spiralling sentences which superficially mimic the endlessly qualified meanderings of a marijuana-saturated brain. In this respect DFW sometimes seems like a very, very intelligent person who, under chemical influence, has slipped a notch, and is now merely a very intelligent writer. In fact, could this style be called the mock-intelligent, long-windedness for comic effect, cf the mock-heroic? But isn't there a danger that this is the kind of joke which posterity will treat harshly, cf the 1,000+ page-long Infinite Jest, whose imposing length might be, if not the point, at least part of the joke, yet which does not stop the book from being simply too long?) Conclude by saying that for all DFW's assumed tricksiness and game-playing, we still react to his stories, or to the bones of them, as though they were ordinarily told fictions, DFW's style being among other things a shorthand that we revel in decoding as much as he relishes using it.

As New York settles into the trial of the year - that of a mother and son allegedly responsible for a coast-to-coast trail of arson, fraud and murder culminating in the disappearance of a rich Manhattan widow - Indiana is settling down to write about it. The court case hadn't even started when he was signed up by HarperCollins for a six-figure sum to produce a novel based on the Oedipal adventures unravelling across Manhattan. </p> <p>The case of Sante Kimes and her son Kenneth is so surreal in its subversion of the American Dream - even former President Gerald Ford has a cameo in it - that it appears perfectly tailored for Indiana. He was initially located alongside Dennis Cooper and Kathy Acker as an author whose appeal was limited to connoisseurs of underground Americana, but his last two novels, Resentment and Three Month Fever, have found him moving towards mainstream literary fame. Over the last decade he has shaped up as one of America's darkest and funniest chroniclers. Even the New York Times - which previously damned all he wrote - described him as \"a huge satirical talent\". </p> <p>That he has received more recognition for these novels than for all his previous work (three novels, two short story collections, several plays, much journalism) is unsurprising. Dealing with cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre murders while satirising the public's insatiable appetite for media-fed gore, the novels offer a particularly skewed take on the crimes and their perpetrators.</p> <p>The poisonously funny Resentment tracks the obsession of a wayward journalist with the trial of Carlos and Felix Martinez, who gunned down their wealthy parents. It ends up finding everyone in Los Angeles morally corrupt. Three Month Fever, meanwhile, is an iconoclastic attempt to weave a fact'n'fiction biography of Andrew Cunanan, killer of the fashion designer Versace. </p> <p>\"I'm kinda mired in crime, but so was Dostoevsky,\" drawls Indiana. \"With Resentment, what attracted me to it was the family story and the distinct possibility that, as the kids had killed their parents, the state would kill the kids. That seemed a perfect metaphor for patriarchal society. And the fact that the trial permeated everywhere - it was like water, it filled everything.\" </p> <p>What is perhaps most striking about both that novel and Three Month Fever is Indiana's attempt to humanise - even empathise with - the murderers. \"Andrew Cunanan was not someone I'd want to be best friends with, but he's an interesting individual and sociopaths interest me. Anyway, Versace struck me as a much worse individual than Andrew.\" He laughs loudly at his suggestion. </p> <p>Underlying that sympathy is an awareness of the media's capacity for making monsters. \"People discuss these cases in a manner which is so Victorian, yet life is not so black and white, good versus evil,\" he argues. \"There's a saying that describes Cunanan well - 'Some people are just not ready for disappointment.' \" </p> <p>Which brings Indiana back again to the dangers of dreaming the American dream. \"Andrew was very much a pure product of American culture - a culture which has defined ontological existence as fame. Outside of this lust for fame, what excuse is there for the cavalcade of nastiness on TV we get every afternoon?\" </p> <p>Indiana came originally from New Hampshire, but fled to Berkeley in the late 1960s and assumed the name Gary Indiana. By the mid-70s he was writing and directing plays in the artistic ferment of New York's East Village. The 1980s found him writing art criticism for the Village Voice and acting in low-budget films - even performing in a scene with Rainer Fassbinder. Limited-edition collections of short stories followed before his 1989 novel Horse Crazy. </p> <p>Each of his novels travels a radically different path from the previous one - Horse Crazy is a beautifully crafted tale of obsession while 1994's Rent Boy overloads with porn and satire. If his style changes, his themes remain the same, along with constant graphic descriptions of gay sex. Indeed, I suggest to Indiana, no writer since William Burroughs has shown such affection for sodomy and shit. </p> <p>\"I like to put things in my books that people avoid, that even novelists avoid or put in flowery language. So I insert things in a very blatant way that people will have problems with. My editor at Doubleday, she was desperate to get the shit out and wrote me notes like 'If you take \"shit\" out of page 101, you can keep the turd on page 103' ! \" </p> <p>Indiana confesses that \"payback is a very bad motive for writing a novel - but it is one of the perks\", and Resentment's treatment of such high-profile American figures as Vanity Fair's crime reporter Dominick Dunne also made Doubleday sweat. </p> <p>\"It's not so much the publishers but the corporations that own them,\" says Indiana. \"They're so scared of stepping on anyone's toes. I happen to have the best First Amendment lawyer in the US as a close friend, so he cleared the way for it to go ahead. We inserted an Author's Note that's as good as the Psychiatrist's Note in Lolita.\" </p> <p>Again, that laugh. Gary Indiana: a shark in US literature's calm waters.</p>",

Indeed, I suggest to Indiana, no writer since William Burroughs has shown such affection for sodomy and shit. \"I like to put things in my books that people avoid, that even novelists avoid or put in flowery language. So I insert things in a very blatant way that people will have problems with. My editor at Doubleday, she was desperate to get the shit out and wrote me notes like 'If you take \"shit\" out of page 101, you can keep the turd on page 103' ! \" Indiana confesses that \"payback is a very bad motive for writing a novel - but it is one of the perks\", and Resentment's treatment of such high-profile American figures as Vanity Fair's crime reporter Dominick Dunne also made Doubleday sweat. \"It's not so much the publishers but the corporations that own them,\" says Indiana. \"They're so scared of stepping on anyone's toes. I happen to have the best First Amendment lawyer in the US as a close friend, so he cleared the way for it to go ahead. We inserted an Author's Note that's as good as the Psychiatrist's Note in Lolita.\" Again, that laugh. Gary Indiana: a shark in US literature's calm waters.",

      "body": "<p><strong> 1700: Scenes from London Life </strong><br>Maureen Waller <br>Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320, 388pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364453,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>At the beginning of the 18th century, Londoners were learning to be proud of their modern city, much rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666 and thriving as a centre of commerce and capital. \"A prodigy of buildings\" equalled only by \"old Rome in Trajan's time\", marvelled Daniel Defoe.</p> <p>Pleased by the grandeur and \"Protestant plainness\" of St Paul's, now dominating the London skyline, he took delight in every \"improvement\". \"Among other public edifices, that of the hospital of Bethlehem, or Bedlam, should not be forgot, which is at the very time of writing this appointed to be enlarged with two new wings, and will then be the most magnificent thing of its kind in the world.\"</p> <p>The greatest metropolis should of course have the greatest lunatic asylum. Defoe seems witness to an age and a city of sometimes ludicrous self-confidence. Yet the London of his novels was different: a place of alleys and prisons, whose inhabitants were turned by commerce into predators.</p> <p>Maureen Waller relies a good deal on Defoe's testimonies, and never quite knows what to do with the contradiction between the vaunting and the fearful accounts he offers of urban existence. In the end, the sense of London at this time as a city of urbanity and modernity - prominent in the recent work of historians such as Roy Porter and John Brewer - is relinquished.</p> <p>Waller talks of the age's \"optimism and ebullience\", but she has a greater feel for the grimness of life. Partly this is because her book is dedicated to the details of everyday existence. 1700 is unreliable when it considers larger patterns of religious or intellectual history, but on the minutiae it is often compelling.</p> <p>These most come to life when Waller finds new material in the archive. Her chapter on marriage is illustrated by vividly desperate wrangles over marriage settlements that she has found among Consistory Court depositions. Her discussion of \"Crime and Punishment\" recovers contemporary accounts in which absurdity vies with horror. The Ordinary (chaplain) of Newgate narrates the demise of legendary pirate \"Captain\" Kidd: he is drunk and roaringly unrepentant when brought to Tyburn, but the rope breaks, and when the scaffold is ready once again the swashbuckler is sober and terrified, begging the gratified clergyman for God's forgiveness.</p> <p>Elsewhere Waller has found good material in the burgeoning newspapers of the period. Their news columns give poignant or mysterious accounts of suicides and murders; their advertisements provide a rich new index to a culture's preoccupations - whether trumpeting the varieties of human and animal monstrosity to be seen at Bartholomew Fair or searching for stolen goods or missing persons. She is perhaps too reliant for her illustrations on the work of others, yet she does concentrate details often scattered through the pages of academic histories, drawn as she is to the quotidian pains and preoccupations of life. </p> <p>We find out about the business of the nightsoil men, and the difficulties of storing the household's ordure until their arrival. We are told of the importance and expense of men's wigs, and of the strange trade in human hair. (One John Matthews, executed at Tyburn, had made a profession of stealing hair from barbers' shops.) We sample an apparently fevered debate about the good or harm done by drinking coffee, which includes a dispute about its effects on men's sexual performance. It \"assists us for your nocturnal benevolencies\" a male enthusiast told women, \"by drying up those crude flatulent humours, which otherwise would make us only flash in the pan.\" </p> <p>These details do not make up the picture of \"life in a city at a unique moment in its history\" that the book's cover proclaims: the title date is but the mid-point of a survey that reaches from Pepys writing in the 1660s as far as Fielding documenting crime in the 1750s.</p> <p>In all this, Maureen Waller's own inquisitiveness and enthusiasm sustain her book, sometimes breathlessly, through a rush of information. One quite typical section of about 10 pages covers coffee houses, the stock market, the growth of auctioneering, the postal system, the development of London newspapers, gambling-mania and drinking. The sense - often disarming and occasionally irritating - is of someone encountering the period for the first time and doing it justice by throwing in everything interesting. </p> <p>The anecdotes and illustrations do have a life of their own, even if they are collected rather than made into a narrative. But never is a source quoted with scepticism, never is one witness contradicted by another: everything is levelled to vivid testimony.

      "bodyText": "1700: Scenes from London Life Maureen Waller Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320, 388pp Buy it at BOL At the beginning of the 18th century, Londoners were learning to be proud of their modern city, much rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1666 and thriving as a centre of commerce and capital. \"A prodigy of buildings\" equalled only by \"old Rome in Trajan's time\", marvelled Daniel Defoe. Pleased by the grandeur and \"Protestant plainness\" of St Paul's, now dominating the London skyline, he took delight in every \"improvement\". \"Among other public edifices, that of the hospital of Bethlehem, or Bedlam, should not be forgot, which is at the very time of writing this appointed to be enlarged with two new wings, and will then be the most magnificent thing of its kind in the world.\" The greatest metropolis should of course have the greatest lunatic asylum. Defoe seems witness to an age and a city of sometimes ludicrous self-confidence. Yet the London of his novels was different: a place of alleys and prisons, whose inhabitants were turned by commerce into predators. Maureen Waller relies a good deal on Defoe's testimonies, and never quite knows what to do with the contradiction between the vaunting and the fearful accounts he offers of urban existence. In the end, the sense of London at this time as a city of urbanity and modernity - prominent in the recent work of historians such as Roy Porter and John Brewer - is relinquished. Waller talks of the age's \"optimism and ebullience\", but she has a greater feel for the grimness of life. Partly this is because her book is dedicated to the details of everyday existence. 1700 is unreliable when it considers larger patterns of religious or intellectual history, but on the minutiae it is often compelling. These most come to life when Waller finds new material in the archive. Her chapter on marriage is illustrated by vividly desperate wrangles over marriage settlements that she has found among Consistory Court depositions. Her discussion of \"Crime and Punishment\" recovers contemporary accounts in which absurdity vies with horror. The Ordinary (chaplain) of Newgate narrates the demise of legendary pirate \"Captain\" Kidd: he is drunk and roaringly unrepentant when brought to Tyburn, but the rope breaks, and when the scaffold is ready once again the swashbuckler is sober and terrified, begging the gratified clergyman for God's forgiveness. Elsewhere Waller has found good material in the burgeoning newspapers of the period. Their news columns give poignant or mysterious accounts of suicides and murders; their advertisements provide a rich new index to a culture's preoccupations - whether trumpeting the varieties of human and animal monstrosity to be seen at Bartholomew Fair or searching for stolen goods or missing persons. She is perhaps too reliant for her illustrations on the work of others, yet she does concentrate details often scattered through the pages of academic histories, drawn as she is to the quotidian pains and preoccupations of life. We find out about the business of the nightsoil men, and the difficulties of storing the household's ordure until their arrival. We are told of the importance and expense of men's wigs, and of the strange trade in human hair. (One John Matthews, executed at Tyburn, had made a profession of stealing hair from barbers' shops.) We sample an apparently fevered debate about the good or harm done by drinking coffee, which includes a dispute about its effects on men's sexual performance. It \"assists us for your nocturnal benevolencies\" a male enthusiast told women, \"by drying up those crude flatulent humours, which otherwise would make us only flash in the pan.\" These details do not make up the picture of \"life in a city at a unique moment in its history\" that the book's cover proclaims: the title date is but the mid-point of a survey that reaches from Pepys writing in the 1660s as far as Fielding documenting crime in the 1750s. In all this, Maureen Waller's own inquisitiveness and enthusiasm sustain her book, sometimes breathlessly, through a rush of information. One quite typical section of about 10 pages covers coffee houses, the stock market, the growth of auctioneering, the postal system, the development of London newspapers, gambling-mania and drinking. The sense - often disarming and occasionally irritating - is of someone encountering the period for the first time and doing it justice by throwing in everything interesting. The anecdotes and illustrations do have a life of their own, even if they are collected rather than made into a narrative. But never is a source quoted with scepticism, never is one witness contradicted by another: everything is levelled to vivid testimony. Passages from novels or plays are given the same status as newspaper reports or legal depositions. One of Waller's favourite sources is Ned Ward's scabrous \"guide\" to London, The London Spy, but Ward is so quotable because he was a brilliantly low-minded satirist, stretching or shrinking what he knew to make satisfying mockery. Here, he is treated as though he were a social anthropologist.

In today's context of short-term scholarship, this is work of exemplary stature, to be criticised strictly with one's hat off. </p> <p>And the project is growing ever larger. Where Goethe's Wilhelm Meister meets with mysterious figures who warn him off his chosen course, Dr Boyle met an unknown American on the stairs of a Berlin institute who positively egged him on: \"Make it three volumes! Goethe deserves it.\" Momentous advice, since, at this tempo, three seem unlikely to be enough. The first volume covered 40 years; this one 13. There are 29 still to go. </p> <p>Whether as cause or effect of that strategic decision, space is given to an encyclopedic knowledge that reaches deep into all Goethe's involvements: administration, architecture, colour theory, mine technology, university and theatre intrigues, politics large and small, literary relationships, cultural polemics, military campaigns - all are presented with total grasp of detail, to the point of self-parody. Works, not only Goethe's, are renarrated at a length specialists do not need and general readers may find obstructive to the biographical line; the narrative is often day-to-day chronicle. </p> <p>With no foreshortening, a whole phase of life can seem arid which, in the longer rhythms of creativity, is a mere trough between crests. Yet against this, there are thought-provoking speculations on the direction of literature and on writers' allegiances and ambitions in the dying years of the Holy Roman Empire. An outstanding chapter on the German invasion of France in 1792 captures the misery of that mud-drowned campaign with positively Tolstoyan force. </p> <p>Such episodes in the revolutionary wars apart, this phase of Goethe's life is uneventful. The shift of emphasis to events outside his control is central to the book's conception: \"the Age\" now dominates \"the Poet\". Goethe hardly gets a mention in the first 70 pages, which are half on the French Revolution and half on Kant's philosophical revolution in Germany. Neither is neutral background: they are the forces which, it is argued, upset Goethe's poetic and intellectual applecart, compelling the renunciation of the subtitle. But renunciation of what? With what result? And why? </p> <p>Goethe had come back from Italy in 1788 after two years of intense seeing and reflecting, reinvigorated and restored after his previous decade of Weimar drudgery, sensitised again to the beauty and vitality of physical forms, confident of his ability to grasp them with enthusiasm and understanding, aesthetic or scientific. Also erotic: he now took a resident mistress, a finishing touch to the restorative of Italy. </p> <p>In his first volume Boyle was mistrustful of Italy and all its works, overlooked Goethe's metaphors of long-term investment and initiation, and judged by short-term returns: why did he write hardly any poetry there? Here he resumes that attack. Unable to ignore the first fine fruits of Italy, the \"Roman Elegies\" written immediately after Goethe's return, he asserts against the clear run of the text that \"present love cannot be shown\", that belief in a \"poetry of possession\" is an illusion.</p> <p>Yet no love poems were ever less illusory, or more convincingly in possession of objects and locations that make love real. The idea that Goethe's poetry was \"paralysed by the disappointments of fulfilled desire\" - that he was caught in \"the prison of sated appetite\" - is a moralistic misreading that sees spiritual sloth and inertia where there was balance and stasis in a present moment. Goethe at his best is the poet of all our todays: </p> <p>\"How do you live, say? I live! And were hundreds of years to be granted, / Hundreds, still I should wish each day to be like today.\" </p> <p>The Italian experience that lay behind this reprehensible contentment is written off as something \"lost and not quite definable\". This again involves unashamedly facing down great and zestful texts, the Italian diary and the letters full of overflowing delight that Goethe is finally dwelling among realities that dissolve the mists of old yearnings, in what came to seem an earthly paradise. </p> <p>The issue is not just ethics but poetics: Goethe \"had not yet realised that the classical objectivity of 'style' was a chimera\". The biographical plot consists in showing how, battered from without by revolution and subverted from within by Kant's analysis of human perception, Goethe consciously \"renounced\" his premature synthesis: idyll and objectivity were equally impossible. The first recognition made him come to terms with a new age, the second restored the true direction of his poetry and also his finer humanity. </p> <p>Dr Boyle's take on \"objectivity\" is surely mistaken about what that word means in literature. In a hierarchy of rigour that rises via science to philosophy, the objectivity of poetry is on the bottom step: a fitting of subject to object and of both of them to words that makes no strict epistemological claim. The scientist has set procedures, and will be satisfied if he can replicate results; the purist philosopher may query these and their objects at every step. </p> <p>That is a long way from literature's modest pretensions. Goethe was no philosopher; his copies of Kant do not suggest intensive use. He was, however, alert to his intellectual surroundings; he knew from informed conversations what Kant's drift was and what it implied for non-philosophers.</p> <p>The passages of Goethe's Italian diary that ruthlessly replace self-indulgent emotionalism with solid objects and presences are close kin to Kant's trashing of the old speculative metaphysics, a clearing of ground for new, firmer structures. But Goethe never claimed an absolute objective vision.</p> <p>Barely back from Italy, he writes: \"Style rests on the deepest foundations of knowledge, on the essence of things insofar as it is permitted to us to know them in visible and graspable shapes.\" That echoes the splendid line in the \"Roman Elegies\" where the \"visible and graspable shapes\" of classical statuary and loved flesh are joined in the poet's delight, so that he now \"sees with an eye that can feel, feels with a hand that can see\". </p> <p>Nothing in all this needed to be \"renounced\", and there is nothing in Goethe's later writing, with its firm grasp on phenomena, to suggest it ever was. Four decades on he still speaks of his \"object-related [gegenst\u00e4ndlich] thinking and writing\". It is seen at work in the equally late account Dr Boyle quotes of what it felt like to be under fire during the French campaign: </p> <p>\"The sound of cannonballs is strange enough, as if it were composed of the humming of a top, the bubbling of boiling water and the whistling of a bird. They were less dangerous because of the wet ground, where one of them hit it stuck, and so my foolish self-exposure was at least safe from the peril of ricochets...</p> <p>\"I could soon notice something unusual was going on inside me. I paid close attention and yet the sensation could only be communicated by a simile. It seemed as if you were in a very hot place and at the same time completely penetrated by the same heat, so that you feel completely at one with the element you find yourself in. Your eyes lose nothing of their power or clear vision, but yet it is as if the world had a certain reddish-brown tinge which makes the situation as well as the objects even more fearful. I could not observe any excitement of the blood, rather everything seemed to be swallowed up in that intense heat.</p> <p>\"It's clear why this condition is called cannon-fever. It remains remarkable that this horrible disquiet reaches us only through the ears: for the thunder of the guns, the wailing, whistling, and crashing of the balls through the air, is really the cause of these sensations.\" </p> <p>Cool, detached, matter-of-fact, this passage is on the high road to realism, to Stendhal's Fabrice at Waterloo and Tolstoy's Andrey at Austerlitz. </p> <p>Which brings us back to that other revolution. Certainly it threatened lives, unsettled thinking and writing, made a way of life harder to sustain. That does not mean it had to be renounced, its value denied. If fulfilment were possible only in the idyllic lulls of history, humanity and poetry would have a long wait. Precisely how events affected Goethe - relatively sheltered in a Weimar that for a decade enjoyed a separate peace - is not made clear until we reach 1797, when a planned new Italian journey is aborted because Napoleon is rampaging down that way.</p> <p>By a strange disproportion in the handling of evidence, this non-event is given more significance than the two years actually spent in Italy in 1786. Indeed, when that experience has been so consistently belittled, it is hard to see how renouncing it can be so major a turning point, or why is it now right for Goethe to return to home and \"marriage\" because (we are told) he \"needed the sex\", when sexual fulfilment was earlier the \"prison of sated appetite\" and part of an illusory objectivity. </p> <p> The argument begins to blur. Renunciation means too many things - being a realist not an escapist, living with life's normal disappointments, not spreading himself too far, writing Faust rather than a book on Italy, not travelling so as to stay with his wife in Weimar (in fact he doesn't). None of this seems anywhere near the quick of creative work or poetic texture. Renunciation, reasserted to the point of tedium and often entwined with religious language, seems more and more an idealistic tic of the critic's, not the mainspring of Goethe's motivation. </p> <p>How could it be, in this of all writers? Poetry is made from loss and deprivation as well as fulfilment, but not from gestures of denial, turning away from experience. Renunciation is too negative a thing, ridiculed in Wilhelm Busch's aphorism \"Abstinence we call the fun / We get from things we haven't done\". More seriously, it is the twisted spirituality of Nietzsche's ascetic priest, the philosophy of the sour grape from which not much lyrical juice can be squeezed. It is sad that so monumental a work of scholarship has focused on a notion so alien to Goethe and to the art he practised.</p> <p>\u0095 TJ Reed is Professor of Modern German at Oxford.</p>",

Whether as cause or effect of that strategic decision, space is given to an encyclopedic knowledge that reaches deep into all Goethe's involvements: administration, architecture, colour theory, mine technology, university and theatre intrigues, politics large and small, literary relationships, cultural polemics, military campaigns - all are presented with total grasp of detail, to the point of self-parody. Works, not only Goethe's, are renarrated at a length specialists do not need and general readers may find obstructive to the biographical line; the narrative is often day-to-day chronicle. With no foreshortening, a whole phase of life can seem arid which, in the longer rhythms of creativity, is a mere trough between crests. Yet against this, there are thought-provoking speculations on the direction of literature and on writers' allegiances and ambitions in the dying years of the Holy Roman Empire. An outstanding chapter on the German invasion of France in 1792 captures the misery of that mud-drowned campaign with positively Tolstoyan force. Such episodes in the revolutionary wars apart, this phase of Goethe's life is uneventful. The shift of emphasis to events outside his control is central to the book's conception: \"the Age\" now dominates \"the Poet\". Goethe hardly gets a mention in the first 70 pages, which are half on the French Revolution and half on Kant's philosophical revolution in Germany. Neither is neutral background: they are the forces which, it is argued, upset Goethe's poetic and intellectual applecart, compelling the renunciation of the subtitle. But renunciation of what? With what result? And why? Goethe had come back from Italy in 1788 after two years of intense seeing and reflecting, reinvigorated and restored after his previous decade of Weimar drudgery, sensitised again to the beauty and vitality of physical forms, confident of his ability to grasp them with enthusiasm and understanding, aesthetic or scientific. Also erotic: he now took a resident mistress, a finishing touch to the restorative of Italy. In his first volume Boyle was mistrustful of Italy and all its works, overlooked Goethe's metaphors of long-term investment and initiation, and judged by short-term returns: why did he write hardly any poetry there? Here he resumes that attack. Unable to ignore the first fine fruits of Italy, the \"Roman Elegies\" written immediately after Goethe's return, he asserts against the clear run of the text that \"present love cannot be shown\", that belief in a \"poetry of possession\" is an illusion. Yet no love poems were ever less illusory, or more convincingly in possession of objects and locations that make love real. The idea that Goethe's poetry was \"paralysed by the disappointments of fulfilled desire\" - that he was caught in \"the prison of sated appetite\" - is a moralistic misreading that sees spiritual sloth and inertia where there was balance and stasis in a present moment. Goethe at his best is the poet of all our todays: \"How do you live, say? I live! And were hundreds of years to be granted, / Hundreds, still I should wish each day to be like today.\" The Italian experience that lay behind this reprehensible contentment is written off as something \"lost and not quite definable\". This again involves unashamedly facing down great and zestful texts, the Italian diary and the letters full of overflowing delight that Goethe is finally dwelling among realities that dissolve the mists of old yearnings, in what came to seem an earthly paradise. The issue is not just ethics but poetics: Goethe \"had not yet realised that the classical objectivity of 'style' was a chimera\". The biographical plot consists in showing how, battered from without by revolution and subverted from within by Kant's analysis of human perception, Goethe consciously \"renounced\" his premature synthesis: idyll and objectivity were equally impossible. The first recognition made him come to terms with a new age, the second restored the true direction of his poetry and also his finer humanity. Dr Boyle's take on \"objectivity\" is surely mistaken about what that word means in literature. In a hierarchy of rigour that rises via science to philosophy, the objectivity of poetry is on the bottom step: a fitting of subject to object and of both of them to words that makes no strict epistemological claim. The scientist has set procedures, and will be satisfied if he can replicate results; the purist philosopher may query these and their objects at every step. That is a long way from literature's modest pretensions. Goethe was no philosopher; his copies of Kant do not suggest intensive use. He was, however, alert to his intellectual surroundings; he knew from informed conversations what Kant's drift was and what it implied for non-philosophers. The passages of Goethe's Italian diary that ruthlessly replace self-indulgent emotionalism with solid objects and presences are close kin to Kant's trashing of the old speculative metaphysics, a clearing of ground for new, firmer structures. But Goethe never claimed an absolute objective vision. Barely back from Italy, he writes: \"Style rests on the deepest foundations of knowledge, on the essence of things insofar as it is permitted to us to know them in visible and graspable shapes.\" That echoes the splendid line in the \"Roman Elegies\" where the \"visible and graspable shapes\" of classical statuary and loved flesh are joined in the poet's delight, so that he now \"sees with an eye that can feel, feels with a hand that can see\". Nothing in all this needed to be \"renounced\", and there is nothing in Goethe's later writing, with its firm grasp on phenomena, to suggest it ever was. Four decades on he still speaks of his \"object-related [gegenst\u00e4ndlich] thinking and writing\". It is seen at work in the equally late account Dr Boyle quotes of what it felt like to be under fire during the French campaign: \"The sound of cannonballs is strange enough, as if it were composed of the humming of a top, the bubbling of boiling water and the whistling of a bird. They were less dangerous because of the wet ground, where one of them hit it stuck, and so my foolish self-exposure was at least safe from the peril of ricochets... \"I could soon notice something unusual was going on inside me. I paid close attention and yet the sensation could only be communicated by a simile. It seemed as if you were in a very hot place and at the same time completely penetrated by the same heat, so that you feel completely at one with the element you find yourself in. Your eyes lose nothing of their power or clear vision, but yet it is as if the world had a certain reddish-brown tinge which makes the situation as well as the objects even more fearful. I could not observe any excitement of the blood, rather everything seemed to be swallowed up in that intense heat. \"It's clear why this condition is called cannon-fever. It remains remarkable that this horrible disquiet reaches us only through the ears: for the thunder of the guns, the wailing, whistling, and crashing of the balls through the air, is really the cause of these sensations.\" Cool, detached, matter-of-fact, this passage is on the high road to realism, to Stendhal's Fabrice at Waterloo and Tolstoy's Andrey at Austerlitz. Which brings us back to that other revolution. Certainly it threatened lives, unsettled thinking and writing, made a way of life harder to sustain. That does not mean it had to be renounced, its value denied. If fulfilment were possible only in the idyllic lulls of history, humanity and poetry would have a long wait. Precisely how events affected Goethe - relatively sheltered in a Weimar that for a decade enjoyed a separate peace - is not made clear until we reach 1797, when a planned new Italian journey is aborted because Napoleon is rampaging down that way. By a strange disproportion in the handling of evidence, this non-event is given more significance than the two years actually spent in Italy in 1786. Indeed, when that experience has been so consistently belittled, it is hard to see how renouncing it can be so major a turning point, or why is it now right for Goethe to return to home and \"marriage\" because (we are told) he \"needed the sex\", when sexual fulfilment was earlier the \"prison of sated appetite\" and part of an illusory objectivity. The argument begins to blur. Renunciation means too many things - being a realist not an escapist, living with life's normal disappointments, not spreading himself too far, writing Faust rather than a book on Italy, not travelling so as to stay with his wife in Weimar (in fact he doesn't). None of this seems anywhere near the quick of creative work or poetic texture. Renunciation, reasserted to the point of tedium and often entwined with religious language, seems more and more an idealistic tic of the critic's, not the mainspring of Goethe's motivation. How could it be, in this of all writers? Poetry is made from loss and deprivation as well as fulfilment, but not from gestures of denial, turning away from experience. Renunciation is too negative a thing, ridiculed in Wilhelm Busch's aphorism \"Abstinence we call the fun / We get from things we haven't done\". More seriously, it is the twisted spirituality of Nietzsche's ascetic priest, the philosophy of the sour grape from which not much lyrical juice can be squeezed. It is sad that so monumental a work of scholarship has focused on a notion so alien to Goethe and to the art he practised. \u0095 TJ Reed is Professor of Modern German at Oxford.",

His kooky characters struggle to abandon the traditional structures of family, religion and convention, while giving the finger to north America's spiritless consumerism; they may not always triumph, but they usually sample enough gritty freedoms to give them (and the reader) more than a glimpse of an alternative way of being. </p> <p>Coupland's latest, Miss Wyoming, approaches the same paradigm from a different angle. What happens when you tire of reinventing yourself? Where do you go? And, perhaps more importantly, who do you take with you? </p> <p>Susan Colgate is an American beauty. She's been a beauty queen since the age of four, a child TV star, a rock 'n' roll bride and, finally, a disenchanted ex-celeb. When her plane crashes and everyone thinks she's dead, she decides to ditch her \"variety pack\" of identities and go in search of a more lasting self. </p> <p>Before long she's raiding the bins at McDonald's and getting scooped up by a garbage truck. \"In her new life she'd have to start at the bottom.\" Coupland splices Colgate's freakish odyssey with episodes from her previous incarnations; in the process he savages America's dependence on success. </p> <p>The other narrative strand follows the bizarre quest undertaken by 37-year-old John Johnson. This affluent \"semi-sleazebag movie producer\" is fed up with his life of hookers, drink and drugs: he also becomes a highway-walking hobo, assuming each new identity as quickly as a change in clothes. And he too has come through a near-death experience, flatlining for a few moments with a vision of Susan Colgate (another recurring motif from Coupland's brand of bourbon-fuelled romanticism). </p> <p>Coupland manipulates the two narratives with devilish mastery: their stories mirror each other, almost touch, then move away. The structure can confuse: it is like watching a TV series in which the episodes have been shuffled. The author's point is that we're living in an age in which time seems to pass more quickly; his twisted chronology is a way of slowing things down, sustaining the narrative's awkward energies and deferring the inevitable outcome. </p> <p>As Johnson notes, you reach a moment in life when thereafter \"it's reruns\". For Coupland, soothsayer of the anxious generation, the only way to break the loop is with love, and that's exactly what his characters are holding out for. There is more than enough fret and fizz here to keep you simmering, and even if Coupland can't resist the gawky, lyrical ending, for this he can easily be forgiven.</p>",

His kooky characters struggle to abandon the traditional structures of family, religion and convention, while giving the finger to north America's spiritless consumerism; they may not always triumph, but they usually sample enough gritty freedoms to give them (and the reader) more than a glimpse of an alternative way of being. Coupland's latest, Miss Wyoming, approaches the same paradigm from a different angle. What happens when you tire of reinventing yourself? Where do you go? And, perhaps more importantly, who do you take with you? Susan Colgate is an American beauty. She's been a beauty queen since the age of four, a child TV star, a rock 'n' roll bride and, finally, a disenchanted ex-celeb. When her plane crashes and everyone thinks she's dead, she decides to ditch her \"variety pack\" of identities and go in search of a more lasting self. Before long she's raiding the bins at McDonald's and getting scooped up by a garbage truck. \"In her new life she'd have to start at the bottom.\" Coupland splices Colgate's freakish odyssey with episodes from her previous incarnations; in the process he savages America's dependence on success. The other narrative strand follows the bizarre quest undertaken by 37-year-old John Johnson. This affluent \"semi-sleazebag movie producer\" is fed up with his life of hookers, drink and drugs: he also becomes a highway-walking hobo, assuming each new identity as quickly as a change in clothes. And he too has come through a near-death experience, flatlining for a few moments with a vision of Susan Colgate (another recurring motif from Coupland's brand of bourbon-fuelled romanticism). Coupland manipulates the two narratives with devilish mastery: their stories mirror each other, almost touch, then move away. The structure can confuse: it is like watching a TV series in which the episodes have been shuffled. The author's point is that we're living in an age in which time seems to pass more quickly; his twisted chronology is a way of slowing things down, sustaining the narrative's awkward energies and deferring the inevitable outcome. As Johnson notes, you reach a moment in life when thereafter \"it's reruns\". For Coupland, soothsayer of the anxious generation, the only way to break the loop is with love, and that's exactly what his characters are holding out for. There is more than enough fret and fizz here to keep you simmering, and even if Coupland can't resist the gawky, lyrical ending, for this he can easily be forgiven.",

Mr Downs now employs 40 people and agrees that internet jobs are risky, but not entirely. He says it is true on a \"micro\" level: that there is a good chance that many who have gained jobs in the internet boom will lose them when companies go to the wall. But it is not true on a \"macro\" level: the internet will continue to be a sector with a wealth of employment opportunities. His view is: \"It all depends on the switching costs for employees.

Ideally your \"skills set\" will not be internet-specific, he says, but will be such that you would be a useful asset to any company in your field. Ms Little supports this. This week Amaze, a company that sets up internet operations for other businesses, announced it is to recruit 50 people over the next two months. These will not only be technical specialists but also journalists and academics not necessarily identified with the net. </p> <p>Mr Downs says: \"Individuals need to build downside risk into their personal skill set acquisition,\" as if reading from an MBA textbook. But he does raise a key point. Those who depend on the internet alone are most vulnerable when the boom times fade. This is not only true of the employees but of the companies.

As far as Ms Miller is concerned it is just another managerial position within Tesco. </p> <p>It is common for small start-up internet companies to invite their employees to share ownership.

And most new companies are not cash-rich and the best they can offer is a stake in the future of the company. At Tesco neither of these rules apply. Ms Miller was given no extra equity in the company and did not even get a pay rise.

      "body": "<p> Want to ride the net wave but not willing to take the risk of quitting your job? Then the answer may be to lend your investment cash and professional skills to a friend or colleague who you believe has a plan that will take off. </p> <p>Freelance travel journalist Sophie Campbell came up with an idea about selling weekend breaks over the net, but it was the business nous of her flatmate, Bridget Guerlin, which made the City sit up and take notice. Last June last year, between moving jobs from Schroder Unit Trusts, where she was the marketing director, to Matrix Investment Management, Mrs Guerlin wrote the company's business plan. She secured the backing of James Ogilvy, managing director of Foreign &amp; Colonial, who agreed to become the start-up's chairman. </p> <p>After that, raising the initial capital was relatively simple. \"It was very, very easy. We thought it would be difficult, but we quickly raised \u00a3600,000 and even had to send cheques back.\" Other friends and colleagues have chipped in, most working two or three nights a week as non-executive directors. One is the editor of a travel magazine, another a lawyer at a major corporate, another an IT specialist at a bank. Currently it is due to go live in April or May, but its identity remains under wraps for now. A thorough business plan and a board with management expertise are essentials to raise financing. \"Everyone's got ideas, but if they've got a business plan formulated and key management in place, it's far easier to secure funding. The crazy days of money pouring into little more than spare-bedroom set-ups are gone. Most of them are now dot bombs, not dot coms,\" says Eric Bain, managing director of Illuminator, one of the 'incubator' funds which finance start-ups. </p> <p>Illuminator will cost out an idea and evaluate whether there's a gap in the market. It may then invest, but also demand a substantial equity stake in the business. </p> <p> <strong> Links</strong> </p> <p> Accountants - most have corporate finance teams which assist in finding finance from VCs and institutions. </p> <p>Venture capital - the British Venture Capital Association has a list of firms.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown's pre-election war chest was replenished by a record \u00a317.2bn public sector surplus in January, according to official figures published yesterday. The windfall more than offset the \u00a39.2bn deficit recorded in December and put the chancellor in an ideal position as he adds the finishing touches to next month's budget. While significant tax cuts are ruled out by the danger of over-stimulating the economy, token measures can easily be afforded without jeopardising the health of the public finances or the expected generosity of the next spending round, economists say. The office for national statistics said January's improvement in the public finances was mainly due to seasonal factors, with record income tax receipts, possibly boosted by bonuses and millennium overtime payments, and strong non-food sales lifting VAT returns. The treasury pointed out that the closing date for self assessment - January 31 - fell on a Monday. Last year it was a Sunday, meaning many people settled tax bills on February 1. The data might also have been flattered by a fallback in government spending to a more normal level after large interest payments on state debt in December and some millennium-related expenditure. Even so, economists said Mr Brown would beat his pre-budget forecast for the public finances this year by a wide margin. \"Barring complete disasters in the remaining two months of the fiscal year, the finances look likely to repeat last year's full-year surplus of around \u00a37bn - \u00a36bn better than Mr Brown predicted in his pre-budget report,\" said Jonathan Loynes at HSBC. \"Accordingly, the chancellor could afford in theory to give away a similar amount next year whilst sticking to his borrowing projections.\" Neil Parker of the Royal Bank of Scotland said: \"We feel it is almost inevitable that the full-year 1999-2000 PSNCR [public sector net cash requirement] will be better than the government's pre-budget report forecast. But we still expect the chancellor to be prudent with his purse strings.\" With the economy growing strongly, significant tax cuts would almost certainly trigger further interest rate rises by the Bank of England to contain inflationary pressure. But tax cuts of \u00a32bn would not over-stimulate demand and would prevent the tax bur den rising over the rest of the parliament, according to last month's green budget, published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The green budget said there would be room in this summer's comprehensive spending review to allocate an extra \u00a33bn to departmental budgets in 2001-02, the last year of the current three-year spending programme, and increase current spending by 2.5% a year in the three years from 2002-03. Spending on this scale would help shore up support among Labour's core voters. A significant shift in Labour's presentation emerged last week when it was admitted for the first time since 1997 that Mr Brown's tax strategy has been redistributive in favour of the poor - the R-word he has shied away from to avoid frightening middle England' voters. Labour MPs are showing signs of getting bolder - or more anxious about their re-election prospects - and party HQ is targeting disaffected heartland voters in what is officially called Operation Turnout.",

However, if you think you've got it bad, spare a thought for the tens of thousands of homeowners who are seeing their monthly mortgage bills double at a stroke. </p> <p>These people took out cheap two-year fixed-rate deals back in early 1998 - a time when severe storms were battering the south coast, Titanic star Kate Winslet was up for an Oscar and the second of the Tamworth Two runaway pigs was being recaptured- in some cases, the rate they paid was fixed at 4% or even less. But now the fixed rate period is coming to an end and they are suddenly being plonked on to their lender's standard variable mortgage rate - typically around 7.74%. In hard cash terms, that could mean a borrower with a \u00a3100,000 interest-only mortgage could see the amount they shell out rising by more than \u00a3300 a month. Over a year that's getting on for \u00a34,000 extra. </p> <p>Most of these deals carry early redemption penalties for up to five years, which means borrower are stuck on the variable rate until perhaps 2003. Unless they can persuade their lender to let them move on to another fixed or discounted rate, their only means of escape will be to pay the redemption penalty in some cases several thousand pounds. </p> <p>What are the various options for homeowners in this position? To analyse what's gone wrong it is necessary to turn the clock back to the start of 1998. Back then, the base rate stood at 7.25% after having risen five times in 1997, while the typical standard variable mortgage rate was 8.7%. The view of many commentators was that mortgage rates would start falling as the UK prepared to join the euro and could go as low as 5% in 2000. So taking advantage of one of the many cheap fixed-rate deals seemed to make perfect sense. </p> <p>However, things didn't turn out as the economists predicted. Interest rates did fall, but then they started rising, and the standard variable mortgage rate is now close to 8% and showing no signs of stopping there. </p> <p>A borrower who took out a \u00a3100,000 loan fixed at 3.99% for two years and is currently paying \u00a3332.50 a month will see this shoot up to perhaps \u00a3645 a month when they move on to the standard variable rate. Some homeowners will be able to absorb this huge leap in costs, but for others it will put \"an enormous strain\" on the family's finances, says Simon Tyler at mortgage brokers Chase De Vere Mortgage Management. </p> <p>If you think you fall into this latter category, the first thing to do is check exactly what the redemption penalties are. If you are not locked in you should be looking to move to another lender's better deal without delay. </p> <p>If there are penalties, talk to your lender to see if there are any other products they will let you switch into. If that doesn't work, there are other options. One is to consider paying the redemption penalty so you can move to another lender's deal. You will need to work out whether you would be better-off staying or going once the costs are taken into account, says Simon Knight at mortgage brokers Independent Mortgage Collection. </p> <p>Sometimes there will be little in it. Take someone with a \u00a3100,000 interest-only loan whose two-year fixed-rate period has come to an end this month and is locked into the lender's standard variable rate (currently 7.74%) until February 28 2002. There is an early redemption penalty of six months' interest at the prevailing variable rate. </p> <p>If they stick with the deal until the end of the lock-in period they will pay a total of \u00a315,480 in mortgage payments. But if they moved to a good-value two-year fixed rate such as one offered by Yorkshire Building Society - 5.89% with no penalties after the two years - their total outlay over the two years would be \u00a311,779. But they will have to pay the redemption penalty, which here would be \u00a33,870, and when this is added to the amount the Yorkshire would charge it gives a total of \u00a315,649. </p> <p>If the sums work in your favour but you can't afford to pay the penalty and you think you're not going to be able to afford the higher payments once you move on to the standard variable rate, you could still go down the remortgage road but add the redemption charge to your new mortgage. So if you need a loan of \u00a350,000 and are stuck with a redemption penalty of \u00a32,000, you borrow \u00a352,000 from your new lender. If this is the only way you can remortgage it is worth considering. </p> <p>The worst thing is to do nothing, says Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol.

It offers a full range of mailing equipment and related financial services and is actively developing new communications products and technologies. </p> <p>Lucinda has always been one of the company's top performers and is the only woman to have been admmited to its crown club for staff who beat their annual targets three years running. </p> <p>She was appointed senior account manager at Pitney Bowes Australia in February 1999, where she was responsible for the mailing and the paper handling divisions of Pitney Bowes for the city of Sydney. </p> <p>Lucinda has recently developed new business opportunities with Hong Kong and City Bank. Throughout her career sales and marketing have been her forte. Before joining Pitney Bowes she spent two years at Champions, a company which invests in London restaurants, as a promotion and marketing assistant. She worked closely with company directors Martin Burridge, Daley Thompson and Sebastian Coe to set up a sports theme restaurant in London. </p> <p>So, what's the secret of Lucinda's success? </p> <p>Here are her 10 tips for successfully building a career in sales and marketing. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Attitude</strong> </p> <p> Adopt a positive attitude and work at developing a good rapport with customers. Make sure that you always give the best of yourself every day at work, that you have a trustworthy personality and that you are confident about what you are selling and believe in the product. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Preparation</strong> </p> <p> Prepare yourself before you meet customers. Get all the information you can to help build up an image of potential customers. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Hard work</strong> </p> <p> Set your own goals. Don't think that your targets are too hard and set by someone who is out of touch. Think they're too easy. Go on, you can double them, serve your customers and earn your pay. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Questioning</strong> </p> <p> Building good relationships with customers comes from targeting the right person and always asking about their opinions and feelings on the situation. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Listening</strong> </p> <p> If questioning is important, listening to what the customers are telling you is also essential in order to sell the right package. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Spotting problems</strong> </p> <p> Identify customers' problems and find out whether your product or service is offering the best solution to address their needs. </p> <p> <strong> 7. Developing ideas</strong> </p> <p> Think outside the box. Too many people think: \"I am selling this product to this customer today\" rather than finding ways of making their products fit. For example, in Lucinda's business, she's not just selling a franking machine. She'll be thinking about who are the end-users; often they may be different from the buyer. How much mail they're sending are they folding it by hand? How many sites does the business have and are there more opportunities? </p> <p> <strong> 8. Follow-up calls</strong> </p> <p> Don't limit yourself to a selective choice of solutions and recognise each customer's potential. Every follow-up call is an opportunity for you to offer a wider range of solutions relevant to their needs. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Learning</strong> </p> <p> Every experience, either bad or good, has something to teach you. Don't be afraid to ask customers \"why\"? when you have lost the sales opportunity. </p> <p> <strong> 10. Persistence</strong> </p> <p> It's all very well achieving points 1 to 9, but you will get knockbacks. You have to take the knocks. I learn from them and move on. Don't take rejections personally: they are saying no to the product, not saying no to you as a person. Today's \"no, thanks\" can become tomorrow's \"yes, please\". Persistence definitely pays.</p>",

Being able to identify opportunities and knowing when to act on them based on nothing more than a gut feeling can be the secret which gives upcoming executives and their businesses that winning edge. Firms are waking up to the commercial value of gut feelings with major banking insurance and recruitment institutions sending key personnel for courses in developing their intuition. Many industry sectors, which rely on reading people and situations and making high level decisions based on a hunch, are following the lead of transatlantic corporate cousins who working on turning the power of the unconscious mind into a potential business tool. Now the new management training concept has been brought to Scotland delivered by Joan Charles who has more than 17 years' experience of counselling executives worldwide. All of us use intuition to a greater or lesser degree, but it is not generally recognised as an ability which can be taught. However, Ms Charles's short course aims to add punch to your hunch to give you the edge in business situations. Managers will learn how to combine intuitive and creative thought processes with more conventional techniques. Ms Charles says that intuition can bring amazing results and can be easily learnt by all age groups and levels of management. Students on her course will learn to benefit from the flow of creative ideas and sense what their best choices are. By fine tuning their intuition they will be able to take a different approach to problem solving while discovering their own strengths and weaknesses. They also learn how to resolve workplace conflicts without too much blood being spilled on the carpet. Despite its mystical connotations of telepathy and clairvoyance, several insurance and recruitment firms, banks, sales and marketing consultants are taking intuition seriously.

      "body": "<p>There are only two ways to make telling someone off an easy experience. Either pick someone who is at least 20 years younger and a foot shorter than yourself, or delegate the responsibility for the telling off to someone else. </p> <p>Having to tick off a team member is one of the most difficult aspects of being a young manager Yet it is a situation that crops up all too often. \"I've been putting off tackling one of my team, Patrick, for about a month,\" admits Martin Adams, associate director of a website design company. </p> <p>\"I've noticed two or three times that he's been playing a networked game when he should be working. Trouble is, some of the other people playing are doing it for research - but it's nothing to do with Patrick's job. I have to tell him to stop doing it, but I just don't know how to go about it.\" </p> <p>According to Ros Taylor of Plus Consulting, it's important to have the right state of mind when you take someone to task. \"First off, don't think of it as a 'telling off',\" she says. \"It's far more about moving a situation forward, overcoming a problem - and there are particular tactics that you can use. </p> <p>\"The best is what we call the DESC approach. Describe the situation, in detail, explaining what the problem is, and why. Make sure you have evidence to back this up. Then offer a solution - what you want them to do, and then the consequences: what will happen if they do - and don't do - as you ask.\" </p> <p>All of which means tackling the situation in a calm, controlled way - which can be difficult if someone has been annoying. \"Part of the reason I'm putting off talking to Patrick is because he makes me so cross,\" says Adams. \"I know he'll tell me that he's done all his work, so why shouldn't he play a game.

      "bodyText": "There are only two ways to make telling someone off an easy experience. Either pick someone who is at least 20 years younger and a foot shorter than yourself, or delegate the responsibility for the telling off to someone else. Having to tick off a team member is one of the most difficult aspects of being a young manager Yet it is a situation that crops up all too often. \"I've been putting off tackling one of my team, Patrick, for about a month,\" admits Martin Adams, associate director of a website design company. \"I've noticed two or three times that he's been playing a networked game when he should be working. Trouble is, some of the other people playing are doing it for research - but it's nothing to do with Patrick's job. I have to tell him to stop doing it, but I just don't know how to go about it.\" According to Ros Taylor of Plus Consulting, it's important to have the right state of mind when you take someone to task. \"First off, don't think of it as a 'telling off',\" she says. \"It's far more about moving a situation forward, overcoming a problem - and there are particular tactics that you can use. \"The best is what we call the DESC approach. Describe the situation, in detail, explaining what the problem is, and why. Make sure you have evidence to back this up. Then offer a solution - what you want them to do, and then the consequences: what will happen if they do - and don't do - as you ask.\" All of which means tackling the situation in a calm, controlled way - which can be difficult if someone has been annoying. \"Part of the reason I'm putting off talking to Patrick is because he makes me so cross,\" says Adams. \"I know he'll tell me that he's done all his work, so why shouldn't he play a game. I'll just get angry and bluster and the situation will go from bad to worse.\" In this sort of situation, it's very important to differentiate between being assertive and being aggressive. \"Being aggressive inevitably has a negative effect,\" says Brian Clegg, author of Instant Motivation . \"Being assertive is more about being calm and in control of the situation. \"One of the best techniques is the 'broken record'; you simply repeat your request whatever someone says.
