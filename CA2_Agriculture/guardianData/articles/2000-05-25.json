      "byline": "Mark Atkinson and Charlotte Denny",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is always hard to be the sub coming on halfway through a match when your side is winning. But for Chris Allsopp, the new boy on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC), the welcome he received from the crowd this week was like an over-the-top tackle from Vinnie Jones. Even before he had stripped off his tracksuit, the catcalls began. At his confirmation hearing in front of the Commons' Treasury select committee, Brian Sedgemore said the MPC was losing a player of \"Arsenal or Manchester United\" standard, with the departure of Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics. His replacement came from the \"Vauxhall league, maybe Kidderminster\". </p> <p>Mr Allsopp is not, it is true, in the running for the Nobel prize. Writing papers for the influential economics journals has never been his game during his 33 years as a don at New College, Oxford, so it is hardly surprising that on paper there are a host of names from British universities who look better qualified. However Mr Allsopp does know what makes an economy tick. His hands-on experience, both here and overseas, leaves most of the rest of the MPC standing. </p> <p>The Treasury committee's non-binding decision to reject his nomination for the vacant position on the MPC is an own goal. MPs and industrial leaders have attacked it for being packed full of pointy heads lacking real world experience. Only DeAnne Julius has the names of big British businesses on her CV. Here comes Mr Allsopp with a distinguished track record advising governments around the world on practical policy issues. His international experience, including spells at the OECD, World Bank and as consultant to the governments of Poland, China and Sweden, fills a significant gap in the MPC, one exposed two years ago by the Asian financial crisis. For MPs to be so critical now smacks of inconsistency when in the past they have complained about the bias towards highly theoretical economists. </p> <p>There is no doubt Mr Allsopp made a poor impression on Monday. His answers were at times hesitant and he seemed genuinely puzzled by some of their questions, though that may have been a reflection of their quality and relevance. However, all that shows is that academics can be made to feel ill at ease when confronted by a panel of aggressive (and partisan) MPs; to reject him as unsuitable without any explanation seems a little harsh. It does however raise the question of what does make an ideal MPC member. </p> <p>Business often suggests the committee would make better decisions if it had more non-economists on it, people who know how companies are run. At the one central bank in the world which has tried this plan - the Reserve Bank of Australia - the economists run rings around the laymen. When the chancellor gave the Bank of England control of interest rates in 1997, he deliberately rejected the idea that it should contain representatives from different regions or sectors of the economy. If MPC members were representative rather than expert, there is a danger that they would simply vote for themselves and their friends rather than the good of the economy as a whole. </p> <p>Mr Brown believes the MPC's remit of keeping inflation under control is best achieved by leaving the job to technicians. So the Treasury has tried to build a team which balances different areas of expertise in the field. Sushil Wadhwani used to work in a hedge fund and is an expert on financial mar kets. Steve Nickell, Mr Allsopp's fellow new boy, is a distinguished labour market economist. The Bank's deputy governor and former chief economist Mervyn King is well known for his work on tax and fiscal policy. With the departure of Willem Buiter, the MPC lacked a macroeconomist - someone who looks at the big picture - which is precisely the area where Mr Allsopp shines. Manchester United would not get very far if they fielded a team of 11 centre forwards. </p> <p>So far the MPC has performed well since it was set up in May 1997. Inflation has remained close to the government's 2.5% target and the economy is enjoying one of its most stable period of sustained growth for decades, partly due to the MPC's good judgment on interest rates. </p> <p>However experts still have to be accountable and able to explain their decisions if they want to succeed in their wider mission of convincing the public of the benefits of low inflation. While Mr Allsopp's primary duty is to make the right decisions on interest rates, if the MPC wants to overcome its image of being deaf to the pain being felt by sectors of the economy, he must be able to defend and explain his decisions in a robust and convincing manner.

      "bodyText": "It is always hard to be the sub coming on halfway through a match when your side is winning. But for Chris Allsopp, the new boy on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC), the welcome he received from the crowd this week was like an over-the-top tackle from Vinnie Jones. Even before he had stripped off his tracksuit, the catcalls began. At his confirmation hearing in front of the Commons' Treasury select committee, Brian Sedgemore said the MPC was losing a player of \"Arsenal or Manchester United\" standard, with the departure of Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics. His replacement came from the \"Vauxhall league, maybe Kidderminster\". Mr Allsopp is not, it is true, in the running for the Nobel prize. Writing papers for the influential economics journals has never been his game during his 33 years as a don at New College, Oxford, so it is hardly surprising that on paper there are a host of names from British universities who look better qualified. However Mr Allsopp does know what makes an economy tick. His hands-on experience, both here and overseas, leaves most of the rest of the MPC standing. The Treasury committee's non-binding decision to reject his nomination for the vacant position on the MPC is an own goal. MPs and industrial leaders have attacked it for being packed full of pointy heads lacking real world experience. Only DeAnne Julius has the names of big British businesses on her CV. Here comes Mr Allsopp with a distinguished track record advising governments around the world on practical policy issues. His international experience, including spells at the OECD, World Bank and as consultant to the governments of Poland, China and Sweden, fills a significant gap in the MPC, one exposed two years ago by the Asian financial crisis. For MPs to be so critical now smacks of inconsistency when in the past they have complained about the bias towards highly theoretical economists. There is no doubt Mr Allsopp made a poor impression on Monday. His answers were at times hesitant and he seemed genuinely puzzled by some of their questions, though that may have been a reflection of their quality and relevance. However, all that shows is that academics can be made to feel ill at ease when confronted by a panel of aggressive (and partisan) MPs; to reject him as unsuitable without any explanation seems a little harsh. It does however raise the question of what does make an ideal MPC member. Business often suggests the committee would make better decisions if it had more non-economists on it, people who know how companies are run. At the one central bank in the world which has tried this plan - the Reserve Bank of Australia - the economists run rings around the laymen. When the chancellor gave the Bank of England control of interest rates in 1997, he deliberately rejected the idea that it should contain representatives from different regions or sectors of the economy. If MPC members were representative rather than expert, there is a danger that they would simply vote for themselves and their friends rather than the good of the economy as a whole. Mr Brown believes the MPC's remit of keeping inflation under control is best achieved by leaving the job to technicians. So the Treasury has tried to build a team which balances different areas of expertise in the field. Sushil Wadhwani used to work in a hedge fund and is an expert on financial mar kets. Steve Nickell, Mr Allsopp's fellow new boy, is a distinguished labour market economist. The Bank's deputy governor and former chief economist Mervyn King is well known for his work on tax and fiscal policy. With the departure of Willem Buiter, the MPC lacked a macroeconomist - someone who looks at the big picture - which is precisely the area where Mr Allsopp shines. Manchester United would not get very far if they fielded a team of 11 centre forwards. So far the MPC has performed well since it was set up in May 1997. Inflation has remained close to the government's 2.5% target and the economy is enjoying one of its most stable period of sustained growth for decades, partly due to the MPC's good judgment on interest rates. However experts still have to be accountable and able to explain their decisions if they want to succeed in their wider mission of convincing the public of the benefits of low inflation. While Mr Allsopp's primary duty is to make the right decisions on interest rates, if the MPC wants to overcome its image of being deaf to the pain being felt by sectors of the economy, he must be able to defend and explain his decisions in a robust and convincing manner. From now on, his every move will be watched closely. Gordon Brown also needs to learn a lesson from the latest episode. The Commons' committee, though it cannot veto the chancellor, is performing an important constitutional duty in holding the performance of the MPC to public account. Its chairman, veteran Labour MP Giles Radice, rightly takes this role extremely seriously. Yet Mr Brown's dismissive response to the committee's reservations about Mr Allsopp suggests he has little if any respect for the committee's views. Even if they are wrong, the MPs deserve a courteous and reasoned response. Otherwise Mr Brown appears contemptuous of the legislative's role in holding the executive to account.

Mrs Wright, who was herself a regulator before moving to the SFO in 1997, said the existing system of solely criminal prosecution for insider dealing required regulators to prove \"intent\" on the part of the insider dealer. With the market abuse offence, she said, \"no proof of intent is necessary\". In fact, provided the market in question could have been accessed from Britain, a deal done in New York could become the subject of civil action here by the FSA, a \"potentially extraordinary result\". Mrs Wright said: \"Effective regulation means proportionate, just and fair regulation. It means coming down hard on the real villains and keeping them out of the market - perhaps for ever. It means giving honest and competent business the chance to thrive ... It also means clarity.\" She repeated earlier concerns at the shrinking resources devoted by chief constables to the investigation of fraud. The SFO has no police officers of its own and relies on local forces to supply personnel when an SFO case emerges in their areas. Mrs Wright said: \"Nobody pretends the present level of resourcing in adequate.\" She repeated her call for a national police resource to be made available to the SFO, and said she hoped a ministerial working group, due to be set up shortly to tackle the problem, would agree. To make anti-fraud action a national priority was essential, she said. \"Money laundered and salted away ... is money which is kept out of the national economy.\"",

McManaman was the man of the European Cup final in Paris last night, beyond all question, and if he can produce the same form for England then maybe the prospects are looking better for a passage through the group phase. The former Liverpool man was his team's metronome in the first half, scored the second of Madrid's three goals, and accomplished much, much more besides. As he intercepted a long pass from Gaizka Mendieta, the Valencia captain, in the closing minutes, turning away from the ensuing challenge with a flicker of his hips, you would have thought that he was performing a media veronica in Las Ventas, Madrid's bullring. </p> <p>The fact that this edition of the European Cup final was being contested for the first time by two representatives of the same country might have seemed to devalue an historic competition. But whatever the rights and wrongs of Uefa's decision to enlarge the entry, the finalists had certainly earnt the right to be there, and the way the fans of both sides turned St Denis into the setting for a fiesta meant that no one could begrudge their good fortune. </p> <p>McManaman was at the heart of Real's play in the first half. He and Redondo probed the fringes of the Valencia rearguard with short passes, but were clearly mindful of the capacity of their opponents for murderously swift breakaways. It was from Redondo's error that, in the 18th minute, three Valencia forwards suddenly appeared goalside of the entire Madrid defence, but astonishingly failed to take advantage with Casillas's goal at their mercy. </p> <p>The price of their failure was made clear 20 minutes later, when Morientes scored the opening goal after Anelka's persistence had enabled Salgado to put in a cross to the far post. It was just reward for Madrid's patient endeavour, embodied in McManaman's willingness to fetch and carry, and his ability to change the pace of the game with a brisk reverse pass or a meandering dribble across the pitch. A long ball out to Roberto Carlos brought spontaneous applause, as did a sidefooted flick to Salgado. </p> <p>His awareness of the movement of Raul, loitering behind the front two, gave Farinos and Gerard a hard time, even though the Real midfield machine was not moving as smoothly as in the previous rounds. The combination almost brought about an earlier breakthrough, when Anelka was encouraged to dribble round Gerardo and hit a shot at Canizares, who had more work to do on the half-hour when McManaman responded to Morientes's cross from the left with an instant shot which brought a fingertip save from Valencia's goalkeeper. </p> <p>For Anelka, returning to his home city, the first half was largely an ordeal evoking his words of a week earlier, when he said that Valencia's style of play would have suited him better than Real's. The truth behind this apparently provocative remark was clear to see as he struggled to receive balls with his back to goal and a defender in close attendance, and the cross with which he created the opening for the goal was a tribute to his willingness to do what does not come naturally. </p> <p>There was a flash of the real Anelka four minutes into the second half, when he raced on to Casillas's long clearance, outran Gerardo and put in a low shot which Canizares fumbled round the near post. That was a move from the blackboard of Hector Cuper, rather than the chessboard of Vicente Del Bosque. Fifteen minutes later the Frenchman showed another flash of initiative when his 30-yard drive almost caught Canizares unawares. And two minutes after that he was popping up in the right-back position, covering for Salgado with an alacrity which might have shocked his old colleagues in the Highbury dressing room. Even more stunning was his last act before being substituted with 10 minutes to go, when he held up his hand to acknowledge an inaccurate pass to McManaman. Some people would have travelled a lot further than Paris to see that.</p>",

Urgent, intense, leaning forward, arguing with passion and with vast, manic eyes behind thick glasses, he is more comfortably viewed from the distance of the kitchen and through half-closed fingers. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising, then, that when the Leicester City manager demanded a unique clause in his contract the directors nodded in assent and backed quickly away. </p> <p>When O'Neill, with the shrewdness of a former law student, negotiated a new three-year deal last summer worth \u00a3800,000 a year, he insisted upon an eight-week close-season \"window\", from May 15 to July 15, when he would be free to talk to prospective suitors. </p> <p>This is the window that Celtic, the club he supported as a boy, have kicked in and clambered through. They will offer him something like \u00a32m a year to be their next manager. </p> <p>Leicester have only themselves to blame for the clause. Two years ago O'Neill thought he had a gentleman's agreement to talk to the Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale. His employers, he felt, reneged. </p> <p>\"Obviously the chairman has Alzheimer's disease or something,\" he said at the time, with some bitterness. \"I will never have dinner with him again.\" </p> <p>There was a suspicion, however, that O'Neill was perfectly happy to remain at Filbert Street. And there he remained when Everton made their approach, followed by Nottingham Forest and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The worry with O'Neill, the former manager of Grantham Town, Shepshed Charterhouse, Wycombe Wanderers and Norwich City, is that he has never proved himself in a big job. And, if he shuns yet another opportunity, those who will applaud his loyalty will be drowned out by those who will question his ambition. </p> <p>A number of well known managers, such as Brian Horton, Frank O'Farrell and Graham Turner, have built reputations in the lower leagues only to falter on a wider stage. </p> <p>Even the great Brian Clough, the manager who influenced O'Neill more than any other, failed at his one big club. He lasted only six weeks at Leeds, although it might be argued that he would have succeeded if he had been given enough time. </p> <p>O'Neill is the ultimate make-do-and-mend manager.

      "bodyText": "Few of us own a living room large enough to accommodate the television punditry of Martin O'Neill. Urgent, intense, leaning forward, arguing with passion and with vast, manic eyes behind thick glasses, he is more comfortably viewed from the distance of the kitchen and through half-closed fingers. It is hardly surprising, then, that when the Leicester City manager demanded a unique clause in his contract the directors nodded in assent and backed quickly away. When O'Neill, with the shrewdness of a former law student, negotiated a new three-year deal last summer worth \u00a3800,000 a year, he insisted upon an eight-week close-season \"window\", from May 15 to July 15, when he would be free to talk to prospective suitors. This is the window that Celtic, the club he supported as a boy, have kicked in and clambered through. They will offer him something like \u00a32m a year to be their next manager. Leicester have only themselves to blame for the clause. Two years ago O'Neill thought he had a gentleman's agreement to talk to the Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale. His employers, he felt, reneged. \"Obviously the chairman has Alzheimer's disease or something,\" he said at the time, with some bitterness. \"I will never have dinner with him again.\" There was a suspicion, however, that O'Neill was perfectly happy to remain at Filbert Street. And there he remained when Everton made their approach, followed by Nottingham Forest and Northern Ireland. The worry with O'Neill, the former manager of Grantham Town, Shepshed Charterhouse, Wycombe Wanderers and Norwich City, is that he has never proved himself in a big job. And, if he shuns yet another opportunity, those who will applaud his loyalty will be drowned out by those who will question his ambition. A number of well known managers, such as Brian Horton, Frank O'Farrell and Graham Turner, have built reputations in the lower leagues only to falter on a wider stage. Even the great Brian Clough, the manager who influenced O'Neill more than any other, failed at his one big club. He lasted only six weeks at Leeds, although it might be argued that he would have succeeded if he had been given enough time. O'Neill is the ultimate make-do-and-mend manager. He was never one of the more fashionable members of Clough's highly successful Forest side of the late 70s and early 80s and, perhaps recalling those days, he appears to have an affection for misfits and misanthropes. Under him those unlikely footballers Steve Guppy, Matt Elliott, Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet have become international footballers. Elliott is a former bricklayer, Lennon a Manchester City reject. Robbie Savage was an apprentice with Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. Stan Collymore's career, on and off the field, is well known. This is not to say that O'Neill would not make an excellent manager of Celtic and, having played as a Catholic in Northern Ireland at the height of the troubles, he is certainly well apprenticed to the religious schism he would experience in Glasgow. But for once the man who is an expert at telling footballers what to do - and managers, directors and TV presenters for that matter - must give himself a few words of advice. And, if he really is up to the job, should he go anyway? Scottish football, after all, is a two-horse race, even if the bloodstock is close to the highest quality. Leicester supporters, meanwhile, are already reviving old campaigns to persuade him to stay. But the club should not stand in his way, even though they have a clause in his contract that would call for \u00a31m compensation from his new employers.

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points.

Nick Knight, allowed by England to play for Warwickshire , made 80 in a total of 184 for one against Glamorgan , just to keep the Zimbabweans' smile in check.",

Askham, it says, was not given an alternative week at another timeshare resort because, since his own unit was unfinished, he would have nothing to offer other timeshare owners in exchange. Nor could he console himself with the Latebreak scheme because the week he requested was in high season. Palm Oasis has failed to reply to Consumer's overtures. </p> <p>Anyone else tempted to try timeshare (which can work well if you're careful) can glean tips from the Timeshare Consumer's Association on 020-8296 0900 or consult their website at www. timeshare.org.uk. And always beware of companies who resort to expensive hard-sell promotions. Those with a good product at a good price can attract customers without pressure tactics. </p> <p><strong> Spinning a line</strong><br> </p> <p> Here's an update on 1st Line, our favourite telesales firm. It's the one which promises you free trials of mobile phones and asks for your bank account details as a security. The next thing many of our readers knew was that a direct debit had been set up without their knowledge. The idea is that you are released from your contract if you notify 1st Line before the fortnight's trial is up, but it doesn't always work like that. </p> <p>Denis Dunn of Essex wrote in a while back after line rental charges began vanishing from his account, despite returning his trial phone. 1st Line apologised via Consumer, but since then he's been threatened with a debt collection agency unless he pays money he doesn't owe. </p> <p>Nigel Harris of Nottingham was cold called by a 1st Line salesman who claimed to be from BT Cellnet and offered him a trial phone with \u00a350 worth of free calls. Harris asked if it could wait until he returned from a six-week trip but he was told the offer would have closed by then. He agreed to accept delivery there and then, to leave the phone at home with a call bar in place, and to take advantage of a month's free line rental as an incentive. </p> <p>When he returned, he found line rental charges had been debited from his account. He rang to cancel the deal and was persuaded to hang on to take advantage of the free calls. Only afterwards did he discover that he was not eligible for the offer because the phone bar had not allowed him to make the qualifying number of calls. His subsequent attempts to contact 1st Line have been in vain and he too is being threatened with a debt collection agency. </p> <p> \u00951st Line takes several weeks to digest this information, then announces its repentance. The accounts of both customers have now been cancelled and outstanding charges waived. Shame it forgot to inform the aggrieved parties about it - Dunn says he still hasn't heard a word. </p> <p><strong> Unanswered call</strong><br> </p> <p> Sue Lukes' problem is, conversely, that she can't entice a certain company to the phone. \"Can you find out what BT Cellnet has against phone calls?\" she asks. Lukes paid her phone bill by telephone banking, then found her service suspended. A letter from BT explained that it did not recommend such a method because payments took three weeks to process. Instead she was asked to call a BT number and give her credit card details over the line. The trouble is that the line is permanently engaged and she can't get through. </p> <p> \u0095BT Cellnet says that Lukes' experience has been \"fed back in to the business to investigate how debit card payments can be speeded up\". It has now permitted her to pay her dues.</p>",

Denis Dunn of Essex wrote in a while back after line rental charges began vanishing from his account, despite returning his trial phone. 1st Line apologised via Consumer, but since then he's been threatened with a debt collection agency unless he pays money he doesn't owe. Nigel Harris of Nottingham was cold called by a 1st Line salesman who claimed to be from BT Cellnet and offered him a trial phone with \u00a350 worth of free calls. Harris asked if it could wait until he returned from a six-week trip but he was told the offer would have closed by then. He agreed to accept delivery there and then, to leave the phone at home with a call bar in place, and to take advantage of a month's free line rental as an incentive. When he returned, he found line rental charges had been debited from his account. He rang to cancel the deal and was persuaded to hang on to take advantage of the free calls. Only afterwards did he discover that he was not eligible for the offer because the phone bar had not allowed him to make the qualifying number of calls. His subsequent attempts to contact 1st Line have been in vain and he too is being threatened with a debt collection agency. \u00951st Line takes several weeks to digest this information, then announces its repentance. The accounts of both customers have now been cancelled and outstanding charges waived. Shame it forgot to inform the aggrieved parties about it - Dunn says he still hasn't heard a word. Unanswered call Sue Lukes' problem is, conversely, that she can't entice a certain company to the phone. \"Can you find out what BT Cellnet has against phone calls?\" she asks. Lukes paid her phone bill by telephone banking, then found her service suspended. A letter from BT explained that it did not recommend such a method because payments took three weeks to process. Instead she was asked to call a BT number and give her credit card details over the line. The trouble is that the line is permanently engaged and she can't get through. \u0095BT Cellnet says that Lukes' experience has been \"fed back in to the business to investigate how debit card payments can be speeded up\". It has now permitted her to pay her dues.",

I wish I could share some of my countrymen's contentment, but the recent discoveries of more mass graves, the untold suffering of those whose toenails and teeth were extracted before being killed, the incredible sadism of cowardly army officers who raped and murdered defenceless women, the smashed skulls of little children, the sight of elderly men hanging naked from their wrists while being beaten to death, prevent me from being happy. Pinochet's crimes are so horrendous that no judicial decision or eventual sentence can ever make up for so much suffering and pain. Besides, I'm absolutely convinced that he will never be tried, let alone sentenced to serve a single day in prison. Former police chief and now designated senator, Fernando Cordero, has synthesized Pinochet supporters' feelings towards the case by unequivocally stating that \"the court has no right to try Pinochet\". He is wrong, yet at the same time he is sadly right, because for over three decades now Pinochet and armed forces personnel at large have been above the law. The military are still very powerful and they know it, so does the government and other cowardly politicians who are afraid to confront the military. Pinochet's defence is going to argue that he is unfit to stand trial, that he is mentally incapacitated to follow complex legal arguments. The courts are going to accept such spurious arguments and the criminal will walk free on so called humanitarian grounds.

The centre will be named the Ashcroft International Business School after the multi-millionaire businessman who completed an HND in business studies at the Chelmsford campus in the 1960s.</p> <p>Mr Ashcroft said he had decided to make the donation after being impressed by his old college during a recent visit. \"I was impressed with the enthusiasm of the management team but at the same time I recognised some of the difficulties associated with developing a university of this type,\" he said. \"I expressed a desire to help, and my commitment to the new business and management centre is the result.\"</p> <p>His donation was immediately dismissed by Labour. Mr Bradley said: \"Mr Ashcroft can well afford such generosity - what he donates in Belizean dollars is more than compensated by what he saves in not paying British taxes.\"</p> <p>Labour MPs were angered in March when Mr Ashcroft was awarded a peerage less than a year after his passage to the Lords was blocked by the cross-party political honours scrutiny committee. The committee said Mr Ashcroft would only be allowed to take up his seat if he settled permanently in Britain by the end of this year. Mr Ashcroft is currently based in Florida.</p> <p>The row over his peerage rumbled on last night when the honours scrutiny committee came under fire for refusing to give details of how it will ensure that Mr Ashcroft has fulfilled the conditions to take up his seat. Sir Anthony Merifield, the clerk to the honours committee, said in a letter to Mr Bradley that he had \"no reason to doubt that Mr Ashcroft will abide by his undertakings\".</p> <p>Mr Bradley dismissed Sir Anthony's letter as \"highly unsatisfactory\" and an example of the establishment closing ranks. \"This high-handed response suggests that the committee is prepared to make a gentleman's agreement with the Conservative party which is not known for its straight dealing,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, rejected suggestions that Mr Ashcroft's donation was a cynical gesture ahead of taking up a seat in the Lords.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Ashcroft yesterday donated \u00a35m to a British university, prompting accusations that the controversial Conservative party treasurer and tax exile is attempting to \"curry favour\" as he prepares to take up his seat in the House of Lords. Labour MPs reacted with suspicion to Mr Ashcroft's announcement, which comes hard on the heels of the unprecedented decision of a cross-party committee of peers to bar him from sitting in the House of Lords until he starts paying full British taxes. Peter Bradley, the MP for The Wrekin, said: \"If Mr Ashcroft wants to show his commitment to this country he should follow the example of the rest of us and start paying taxes now.\" Mr Ashcroft, who says he will move to Britain by the end of December, attempted yesterday to demonstrate that he is putting down roots in Britain, announcing a \u00a35m donation to fund a new business school at Anglia Polytechnic University. The centre will be named the Ashcroft International Business School after the multi-millionaire businessman who completed an HND in business studies at the Chelmsford campus in the 1960s. Mr Ashcroft said he had decided to make the donation after being impressed by his old college during a recent visit. \"I was impressed with the enthusiasm of the management team but at the same time I recognised some of the difficulties associated with developing a university of this type,\" he said. \"I expressed a desire to help, and my commitment to the new business and management centre is the result.\" His donation was immediately dismissed by Labour. Mr Bradley said: \"Mr Ashcroft can well afford such generosity - what he donates in Belizean dollars is more than compensated by what he saves in not paying British taxes.\" Labour MPs were angered in March when Mr Ashcroft was awarded a peerage less than a year after his passage to the Lords was blocked by the cross-party political honours scrutiny committee. The committee said Mr Ashcroft would only be allowed to take up his seat if he settled permanently in Britain by the end of this year. Mr Ashcroft is currently based in Florida. The row over his peerage rumbled on last night when the honours scrutiny committee came under fire for refusing to give details of how it will ensure that Mr Ashcroft has fulfilled the conditions to take up his seat. Sir Anthony Merifield, the clerk to the honours committee, said in a letter to Mr Bradley that he had \"no reason to doubt that Mr Ashcroft will abide by his undertakings\". Mr Bradley dismissed Sir Anthony's letter as \"highly unsatisfactory\" and an example of the establishment closing ranks. \"This high-handed response suggests that the committee is prepared to make a gentleman's agreement with the Conservative party which is not known for its straight dealing,\" he said. Mr Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, rejected suggestions that Mr Ashcroft's donation was a cynical gesture ahead of taking up a seat in the Lords.",

Before long, our hero is being hounded cross-country by assassins, while simultaneously trying to figure out who he is. The presence of respected left-field director Liman behind the camera suggests that The Bourne Identity may well adopt the same tack as The Talented Mr Ripley in converting an essentially pulp-thriller source book into a weightier, more high-brow picture. The identity problems of Bourne's central character echo that of the blank and predatory character that Damon played in Ripley. The Bourne Identity has been regarded as one of Universal's most prestigious projects for over a year. Pitt pulled out of the movie earlier this week due to a schedule conflict with his starring role in Tony Scott's Spy Game. Damon has recently completed work on the Robert Redford-directed drama The Legend of Bagger Vance, and is currently collaborating with director Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot) on a treatment of the Wally Lamb novel I Know This Much is True.",

The OAU said this month's offensive alone killed thousands. Both countries, among the world's 10 poorest, have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the conflict, which complicated drought-relief efforts in the region..

      "body": "<p><strong>Which Scotsman captained England at cricket?</strong> asks Mick Crabtree</p> <p>There have been quite a few Scottish-born England Test players - among them Ian Peebles, David Larter, Gregor MacGregor, Peter Such and, most recently, Gavin Hamilton - but only one has captained England. That was Mike Denness, who took over from Ray Illingworth for the 1973-74 tour of West Indies, and continued as captain until the first Test of 1975, when he was sacked after England lost heavily to Australia. In all Denness, who was born in Ayr, captained England in 19 of his 28 Tests, winning six, losing five and drawing eight. Douglas Jardine, England's captain on the infamous Bodyline tour of Australia in 1932-33, was of Scottish stock, but he was actually born in India. </p> <p><strong>What is Zimbabwe's lowest Test score?</strong> asks Ian Lansdale</p> <p>Zimbabwe went 39 Tests without being dismissed for under 100 - but now they've done it twice in their last three matches. At Port-of-Spain in Trinidad in March, Zimbabwe needed only 99 to win their inaugural Test against West Indies. But West Indies' fast bowlers dismantled them for 63, and pulled off an improbable victory. And now it's happened again: at Lord's, in their first Test in England, Zimbabwe were shot out for 83. They were nearly dismissed for less than 100 in their second innings too, but Bryan Strang's late flourish at least took them into three figures.</p> <p> <strong>Has a team which was forced to follow on ever won the match?</strong> asks Dan Ward</p> <p>It has happened twice in Tests, most famously at Headingley in 1981 in what has become known as 'Botham's Match'. After Australia made 401, England were shot out for 174 and followed on 227 runs behind. On the fourth morning the England players all booked out of their hotel, expecting an early finish. Not long afterwards they were 135 for 7 in their second innings, still 92 behind. But Ian Botham's majestic 149 not out, helped by useful contributions from tailenders Graham Dilley (56) and Chris Old (29), meant that England managed to reach 356, which still left Australia only 130 to win. Bob Willis roared down the hill at Headingley to take 8 for 43, Australia collapsed to 111 all out, and England went cricket-mad. The other occasion also involved England beating Australia: it was at Sydney in December 1894. Australia made 586 (Syd Gregory 201, George Giffen 161) and England replied with 325. Following on, England made 437 (Albert Ward 117), then bowled Australia out for 166 (Bobby Peel 6-67) to win by 12 runs.</p> <p><strong>I work in the museum at the Wanderers ground in Johannesburg. One of the items in our collection is a bat autographed by members of a private tour captained by Lord Tennyson and including Joe Hardstaff, Arthur Wellard and Norman Yardley. Unfortunately there's no date on the bat and I am trying to identify the other signatures. Can you tell me more about the tour?</strong> asks Alison Tetley</p> <p>This was a tour of India (not, as you may have thought, South Africa) in 1937-38, sponsored and led by Lord Tennyson, who as Lionel Tennyson had captained England in 1921. It was a strong side, not far below Test-strength and containing several current or future internationals, which won a series of unofficial Tests against India 3-2. The full side was: Lord Tennyson (capt), WJ Edrich, PA Gibb, AR Gover, J Hardstaff, TO Jameson, James Langridge, NT McCorkell, IAR Peebles, GH Pope, TPB Smith, AW Wellard, TS Worthington and NWD Yardley. In all they played 24 matches, winning eight, losing five and drawing 11. The 1939 <em>Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</em> says the team had a lot of trouble with injuries and illness - Tennyson himself went down with dysentery. Overall Bill Edrich (Middlesex and England) was the leading batsman, with 876 runs at an average of 46.10, and George Pope (Derbyshire and England) was the top bowler, with 58 wickets at 15.93. </p> <p><strong>Rudra Singh, the former Indian international, is now my captain at Blackpool Cricket Club. Can you tell me about his Test record?</strong> asks Donald</p> <p>Rudra Pratap Singh, who was born in Lucknow on Jan 6, 1965, played two one-day internationals for India as a right-arm fast-medium bowler. Both games were in the 1986-87 series against Australia. He didn't take a wicket in the first one, at Hyderabad, but did dismiss Dean Jones in the second, at Rajkot. That was his only international wicket, at an overall cost of 77 runs. He didn't bat in either match. Rudra Singh had a long first-class career for the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh: starting in 1982-83, he scored 1413 runs, with one century, and took 150 wickets in 59 matches up to 1995-96. He's now a leading coach in England. </p> <p><strong>I am an ardent cricket fan and am planning to see a match at Lord's. What is the best place to view and enjoy the match: the Grand, Mound, Edrich or Compton Stands?</strong> asks Deepak Malik</p> <p>It depends on whether you like to watch from sideways-on or end-on, and whether you want to be at ground level or higher up. If you want to be behind the bowler's arm - the sort of view you generally get on TV - the Edrich and Compton Stands are the best bet. If you're ordering a ticket over the phone, then tell them you want to be behind the arm, as both stands stretch round quite a long way and you might find yourself looking over mid-on or mid-off. I would go for the upper tier, because the lower ones can get a bit cold. Of course, you might get wet in the upper tier, as they're not covered! The Mound Stand is more sideways-on, and the back part is covered. The Grand Stand gives a good side-on view too. It's the newest of the stands - and also the most expensive. That's for international matches: if you go to a county game at Lord's you should be able to wander around and have a look at all the stands to see which one you prefer.</p> <p> <strong>Who has taken the most hat-tricks in first-class cricket?</strong> asks Ben Spivey</p> <p>Doug Wright took seven hat-tricks in his first-class career, all of them for Kent, although he also took 108 wickets in 34 Tests for England. He was a quickish legspinner, who played either side of the Second World War, and had a distinctive bounding approach to the wicket. He was sometimes erratic - his Test wickets cost nearly 40 runs apiece - but on his day he was deadly. He made his debut for Kent in 1932, when he was only 17, captained them from 1954 to 1956, and retired in 1957. He died in November 1998, aged 84. </p> <p><strong>I was confused by your answer to last week's question regarding the \"hit ball twice\" law. If someone is allowed to hit the ball again in order to protect his wicket, what is the point of the law?</strong> asks GR Young</p> <p>The law does permit the batsman to hit the ball a second time (for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket), for example if the ball is trickling backwards towards the stumps. He also wouldn't be out if he was returning the ball to a fielder. What he's not allowed to do is deliberately hit it again and look for a run. Otherwise he could legally flick the ball up, a bit like a tennis serve, and smash it away wherever he liked. The full law can be found in <em>Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</em> (this year the Laws start on page 1426), or on the Lord's website (<a href=\"http://www.lords.org/mcc/laws/index.html\">click here</a>).</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.</em> </p> <p> We regret that not all questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into</p>",

      "body": "<p>There are 40m Americans of Irish descent, ten times more than Ireland's population. That single astounding statistic says more than any amount of political analysis about the key role of the US in the current Northern Ireland peace process.</p> <p>The Clinton administration, which did so much to transform the Good Friday deal from distant dream to wobbly reality, still has an enormous stake in its success. So too, for that matter, would a Republican or any other brand of president.</p> <p>That explains, to some extent, why President Clinton so brusquely rejected Tony Blair's pleas for help in the ongoing row over the proposed change of name for the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p> <p>As revealed in today's Guardian, the prime minister twice asked Clinton, his close friend, to lean on the Irish government and Sinn Fein to compromise over the name change.</p> <p>The president rebuffed the suggestion. Bowing to Ulster Unionist demands for the royal title to be retained, he said it \"would be like leaving Alabama and Georgia under all-white cops\".</p> <p>The bluntness of the language underscores the exasperation of the White House with the latest attempts by unionist hardliners to scupper the power-sharing accord. And that exasperation is in turn the result of the enormous political clout of the various Irish lobbies in Washington.</p> <p>British and northern Irish critics of the US government's stance often mistakenly attribute it to the brazen propaganda of Noraid, the best-known republican front organisation in America. Noraid has indeed raised the republican profile, as well as many millions of dollars in so-called humanitarian aid.</p> <p>It has also happily exploited the profound ignorance of many Americans about events in Northern Ireland. One widespread fallacy, for example, is that Ulster Catholics have no vote.</p> <p>But Noraid is a bit-player on the raucous stage of Irish-American lobbying. Much more important are the Dublin government and the Irish business community, both of which have benefited enormously from US investment and goodwill.</p> <p>Nationalist politicians too have assiduously cultivated the White House, none more successfully than the Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, may have notoriously broken down the invisible barrier against republicans, but it is Hume who has quietly, firmly, ensured that successive presidents keep Northern Ireland near the top of the agenda.</p> <p>As the rival factions of Ulster Unionists square off for their showdown on Saturday, President Clinton has fired off an unmistakable warning against any attempt by the British government to temporise on the issue of police reforms.</p> <p>The Americans understand, perhaps better than the spin doctors of Whitehall and Stormont, that changing the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to the Police Service of Northern Ireland is much more than petty symbolism. It is the key to making a revamped police force acceptable to nationalists and republicans - and to Washington as the main peace-broker.</p> <p>What President Clinton has done, in effect, is to underline that where Northern Ireland is concerned, he is less of an ally of the Blair government than an arbiter of the accord.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited/nireland\">Nothern Ireland: special report</a><br> <a href=\"http://inac.org\" target=\"_new\">Noraid</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/pdf/news/Northern_Ireland/fullreport.pdf\">The Patten report on police reform</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.com/cgi-bin/todaysnews\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a><br> <a href=\"http://scripts.ireland.com/tardis.plx?main=newspaper/front\" target=\"_new\">Irish Times</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.irishnews.com\" target=\"_new\">Irish News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ireland.com/special/peace\" target=\"_new\">The Path to Peace: a history of the Northern Ireland peace process</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.uup.org\" target=\"_new\">Ulster Unionists</a><br> <a href=\"http://sinnfein.ie\" target=\"_new\">Sinn Fein</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.indigo.ie/sdlp\" target=\"_new\">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a></p>",

That single astounding statistic says more than any amount of political analysis about the key role of the US in the current Northern Ireland peace process. The Clinton administration, which did so much to transform the Good Friday deal from distant dream to wobbly reality, still has an enormous stake in its success. So too, for that matter, would a Republican or any other brand of president. That explains, to some extent, why President Clinton so brusquely rejected Tony Blair's pleas for help in the ongoing row over the proposed change of name for the Royal Ulster Constabulary. As revealed in today's Guardian, the prime minister twice asked Clinton, his close friend, to lean on the Irish government and Sinn Fein to compromise over the name change. The president rebuffed the suggestion. Bowing to Ulster Unionist demands for the royal title to be retained, he said it \"would be like leaving Alabama and Georgia under all-white cops\". The bluntness of the language underscores the exasperation of the White House with the latest attempts by unionist hardliners to scupper the power-sharing accord. And that exasperation is in turn the result of the enormous political clout of the various Irish lobbies in Washington. British and northern Irish critics of the US government's stance often mistakenly attribute it to the brazen propaganda of Noraid, the best-known republican front organisation in America. Noraid has indeed raised the republican profile, as well as many millions of dollars in so-called humanitarian aid. It has also happily exploited the profound ignorance of many Americans about events in Northern Ireland. One widespread fallacy, for example, is that Ulster Catholics have no vote. But Noraid is a bit-player on the raucous stage of Irish-American lobbying. Much more important are the Dublin government and the Irish business community, both of which have benefited enormously from US investment and goodwill. Nationalist politicians too have assiduously cultivated the White House, none more successfully than the Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, may have notoriously broken down the invisible barrier against republicans, but it is Hume who has quietly, firmly, ensured that successive presidents keep Northern Ireland near the top of the agenda. As the rival factions of Ulster Unionists square off for their showdown on Saturday, President Clinton has fired off an unmistakable warning against any attempt by the British government to temporise on the issue of police reforms. The Americans understand, perhaps better than the spin doctors of Whitehall and Stormont, that changing the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to the Police Service of Northern Ireland is much more than petty symbolism. It is the key to making a revamped police force acceptable to nationalists and republicans - and to Washington as the main peace-broker. What President Clinton has done, in effect, is to underline that where Northern Ireland is concerned, he is less of an ally of the Blair government than an arbiter of the accord.

      "byline": "Hugh Sebag-Montefiore",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The film U-571, which is released in Britain next week, is currently one of the top-grossing films in America. However, it has achieved its success in spite of the fact that, or perhaps because, it has tampered with history. The film shows the Americans, rather than the British, capturing an Enigma cipher machine, a factor which, not surprisingly, makes the film much more likely to do well in the US. However, the real-life story of the British capturing an Enigma from the U-110, on which the film is based, is, if anything, even more dramatic and moving than the action shown in the movie. This leads one to question whether the director of U571 might have done better to have dramatised the true story. </p> <p>The British hunt for the German submarine U-110 began shortly after midday on May 9 1941. That was when Joe Baker Cresswell, the commander of the British destroyer HMS Bulldog, one of the group of warships protecting a convoy heading from Britain to America, looked on with horror as the U-boat drew blood for the first time. </p> <p>He could not see the submarine itself. All he saw were two tall towers of water shooting up into the air on the right side of two merchant ships. That was enough to tell Baker Cresswell that the ships had been torpedoed by a U-boat lurking on the convoy's right flank. </p> <p>But even as the two ships sank he knew that a trap he had set was about to snap shut on the unsuspecting enemy. He had placed the British corvette HMS Aubretia on the convoy's right flank to provide for precisely this eventuality. It now charged towards the spot from where the torpedoes appeared to have been fired, and, having identified the U-boat on its asdic sonar equipment, dropped the first pattern of depth charges. </p> <p>The U-boat was the U-110. It might have sunk a third ship had it not been for an accident. The final torpedo fired had remained stuck inside the tube. This was to have fatal consequences for many of the crew. Normally, after a torpedo was fired from the U-boat's bow, water was pumped into the tanks in the bow to compensate for the departure of the missile. However, given that the torpedo on this occasion never left the U-boat, the pumped-in water merely unbalanced it for just long enough to stop it diving out of harm's way. By the time its 28-year-old commander Fritz-Julius Lemp was able to give the order to dive, it was too late. </p> <p>Lemp's crew winced as HMS Aubretia's depth charges exploded and the whole U-boat vibrated. There was a scraping, creaking sound, as the metal deck plates rubbed together and bent, until it seemed inevitable that the deck itself would be torn in half under their feet. </p> <p>When the extinguished lights came on again, all eyes in the control room were fixed on Lemp. Leaning nonchalantly against the periscope, with his cap pushed on to the back of his head, he murmured soothing words of reassurance to those around him. \"It's OK. We're all going to be fine,\" he said, followed by the grim joke: \"You don't think I'm going to let them catch me and shoot me, do you?\" This encouraged one of the veteran submariners to advise Helmut Ecke, the 23-year-old journalist who was supposed to be covering the action on the U-boat for the German armed forces propaganda unit, to mention the men's terrified faces in one of his propaganda articles. Ecke, who is still living in Germany today, will never forget the terror he experienced as the depth charges went off. </p> <p>But after the men in the U-110's control room had heard the damage reports coming in, even Lemp's jokes wore a little thin. The damaged batteries were giving off a whiff of chlorine gas, none of the depth meters were working, so it was impossible to tell whether they were sinking or rising. A loud hissing sound suggested that the pressurised air, which was supposed to be held back in reserve so that it could be used to blast the U-boat to the surface in an emergency, was escaping. </p> <p>Lemp was eventually forced to announce to his men that he could not control the U-boat, and there was nothing more he could do. \"We must wait and see what happens,\" he muttered, and to anyone still listening, he added: \"I want you all to think of home, or of something beautiful.\" </p> <p>Herbert Langsch, one of three Enigma operators still alive in Germany, resigned himself to death. As he pictured the U-boat tumbling into the abyss where it would soon be crushed by the growing pressure, he thought of his childhood sweetheart, and tried to imagine how she would feel when she knew he had died. </p> <p>But then the men felt the submarine rocking from side to side and the word came down the line that they had managed to make it to the surface after all. They were saved. Or so they thought. For the scene which greeted the German crew, as they climbed onto the deck outside, was like something out of Dante's inferno. Two large warships were steaming towards the crippled U-boat, as if intent on ramming it. At the same time, guns were firing on them from all sides. They were surrounded. </p> <p>Some of the crew jumped into the water immediately. Others hung around on deck, hypnotised by the sight of the destroyers bearing down on them. Radio operator Heinz Wilde, who still lives in Germany, climbed up the conning tower ladder to ask Lemp whether he should destroy the Enigma machine and code-books. Lemp merely shouted back at him to get out, so Wilde followed the other crew members into the sea. </p> <p>The engineers opened up the vents so that the diving tanks would be flooded. They then jumped overboard with Lemp, mistakenly believing the U-boat would sink in a matter of minutes. It was only when it failed to sink that Lemp called out to another officer that they should try to climb back on board to see what could be done. But, at that moment, the U-boat was swept beyond their reach. That was the last time anyone saw Lemp. </p> <p>Lieutenant David Balme, who was in charge of the Bulldog's boarding party, sent over to the U-110 in a whaler decided that he should be the first to climb down the conning tower. It takes a particular kind of courage to venture inside a captured submarine. For all he knew, scuttling charges set by the Germans might explode at any minute. As he stepped into its control room, he suddenly felt very lonely and isolated. The interior was tinged with blue by the emergency lighting. Apart from the sound of his own breathing, all Balme could hear was a faint hissing, and the sound of the Atlantic waves lapping against the hull. To his relief, he soon discovered he was alone, and he shouted to the rest of the boarding party to follow him down. </p> <p>While Balme was arranging his men into a human chain so that they could pass all the code-books and charts up the conning tower and into the whaler waiting for them outside, his telegraphist tapped him on the shoulder and said: \"Come and look in the radio room. There's something rather interesting I want to show you.\" On the table in the radio room was a machine like a typewriter. The telegraphist proceeded to show Balme how, when he pressed one letter key on the keyboard, another letter was highlighted on the display panel. Balme instructed the telegraphist to use the screwdriver in his toolbag to undo the four screws securing the machine to the table. Then it, too, was passed up to the deck outside. </p> <p> It took the men about an hour and a half to clear all the books, papers and machinery out of the U-boat. Then Baker Cresswell sent over some sandwiches. Balme settled down to eat his while sitting at Lemp's roll-top desk. Inside the desk, he found an Iron Cross, some pictures of Lemp's family, and a sealed envelope. Balme, who now lives in the south of England, carefully put all three items into his pocket before returning to the Bulldog. The next morning the U-boat sank. </p> <p>Two days later, HMS Bulldog docked in Scapa Flow, the British naval base in the Orkneys. Baker Cresswell was greeted by Allon Bacon, an intelligence officer who was supposed to take the documents down to Bletchley Park, the code-breaking centre. \"Never mind about losing the U-110,\" Bacon said. \"From our point of view, it was a good thing, as we can now keep all this quiet. For God's sake never breathe a word about this to anyone.\" Baker Cresswell replied that he would have to tell the commander-in-chief of the home fleet. \"Yes, of course,\" said Bacon, \"but no one else.\" </p> <p>Bacon was down in London by 6pm on May 13. Three hours later, he was driven through the gates into Bletchley Park. As he walked into the naval intelligence section, he triumphantly held his briefcase containing the most important captured papers over his head, like an athlete who had just won a gold medal. </p> <p>Later that night, as Baker Cresswell sailed back to Iceland, he received the following signal about the operation which had been code-named \"Primrose\" from Sir Dudley Pound, the first sea lord: \"Following from first sea lord. Hearty congratulations. The petals of your flower are of rare beauty.\" He and the rest of the crew were to receive further congratulations from King George VI, who stated that the operation was \"perhaps the most important single event in the whole war at sea.\" </p> <p>The documents and Enigma machine seized from the U-110 did not, in spite of what is stated in the U-571 film and in the TV documentary Station X, recently repeated on Channel 4, help the British code-breakers to break the main naval Enigma code for the first time. That was achieved thanks to the capture of Enigma code-books from a series of German trawlers. Even the capture of the Enigma machine was no help. Other Enigma cipher machines and apparatus had already been captured by the British. But in the envelope seized by David Balme there was something almost as valuable: the settings and procedure to be used for \"Offizier\" Enigma messages, the especially important doubly enciphered messages sent to officers in U-boats while they were at sea. These crucial messages might never have been read by the British had it not been for the capture of the U-110. </p> <p>Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's book Enigma: The Battle for the Code, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson today, price \u00a320. The author lectures on Enigma at the British Library bookshop at 1pm on June 2</p>",

      "bodyText": "The film U-571, which is released in Britain next week, is currently one of the top-grossing films in America. However, it has achieved its success in spite of the fact that, or perhaps because, it has tampered with history. The film shows the Americans, rather than the British, capturing an Enigma cipher machine, a factor which, not surprisingly, makes the film much more likely to do well in the US. However, the real-life story of the British capturing an Enigma from the U-110, on which the film is based, is, if anything, even more dramatic and moving than the action shown in the movie. This leads one to question whether the director of U571 might have done better to have dramatised the true story. The British hunt for the German submarine U-110 began shortly after midday on May 9 1941. That was when Joe Baker Cresswell, the commander of the British destroyer HMS Bulldog, one of the group of warships protecting a convoy heading from Britain to America, looked on with horror as the U-boat drew blood for the first time. He could not see the submarine itself. All he saw were two tall towers of water shooting up into the air on the right side of two merchant ships. That was enough to tell Baker Cresswell that the ships had been torpedoed by a U-boat lurking on the convoy's right flank. But even as the two ships sank he knew that a trap he had set was about to snap shut on the unsuspecting enemy. He had placed the British corvette HMS Aubretia on the convoy's right flank to provide for precisely this eventuality. It now charged towards the spot from where the torpedoes appeared to have been fired, and, having identified the U-boat on its asdic sonar equipment, dropped the first pattern of depth charges. The U-boat was the U-110. It might have sunk a third ship had it not been for an accident. The final torpedo fired had remained stuck inside the tube. This was to have fatal consequences for many of the crew. Normally, after a torpedo was fired from the U-boat's bow, water was pumped into the tanks in the bow to compensate for the departure of the missile. However, given that the torpedo on this occasion never left the U-boat, the pumped-in water merely unbalanced it for just long enough to stop it diving out of harm's way. By the time its 28-year-old commander Fritz-Julius Lemp was able to give the order to dive, it was too late. Lemp's crew winced as HMS Aubretia's depth charges exploded and the whole U-boat vibrated. There was a scraping, creaking sound, as the metal deck plates rubbed together and bent, until it seemed inevitable that the deck itself would be torn in half under their feet. When the extinguished lights came on again, all eyes in the control room were fixed on Lemp. Leaning nonchalantly against the periscope, with his cap pushed on to the back of his head, he murmured soothing words of reassurance to those around him. \"It's OK. We're all going to be fine,\" he said, followed by the grim joke: \"You don't think I'm going to let them catch me and shoot me, do you?\" This encouraged one of the veteran submariners to advise Helmut Ecke, the 23-year-old journalist who was supposed to be covering the action on the U-boat for the German armed forces propaganda unit, to mention the men's terrified faces in one of his propaganda articles. Ecke, who is still living in Germany today, will never forget the terror he experienced as the depth charges went off. But after the men in the U-110's control room had heard the damage reports coming in, even Lemp's jokes wore a little thin. The damaged batteries were giving off a whiff of chlorine gas, none of the depth meters were working, so it was impossible to tell whether they were sinking or rising. A loud hissing sound suggested that the pressurised air, which was supposed to be held back in reserve so that it could be used to blast the U-boat to the surface in an emergency, was escaping. Lemp was eventually forced to announce to his men that he could not control the U-boat, and there was nothing more he could do. \"We must wait and see what happens,\" he muttered, and to anyone still listening, he added: \"I want you all to think of home, or of something beautiful.\" Herbert Langsch, one of three Enigma operators still alive in Germany, resigned himself to death. As he pictured the U-boat tumbling into the abyss where it would soon be crushed by the growing pressure, he thought of his childhood sweetheart, and tried to imagine how she would feel when she knew he had died. But then the men felt the submarine rocking from side to side and the word came down the line that they had managed to make it to the surface after all. They were saved. Or so they thought. For the scene which greeted the German crew, as they climbed onto the deck outside, was like something out of Dante's inferno. Two large warships were steaming towards the crippled U-boat, as if intent on ramming it. At the same time, guns were firing on them from all sides. They were surrounded. Some of the crew jumped into the water immediately. Others hung around on deck, hypnotised by the sight of the destroyers bearing down on them. Radio operator Heinz Wilde, who still lives in Germany, climbed up the conning tower ladder to ask Lemp whether he should destroy the Enigma machine and code-books. Lemp merely shouted back at him to get out, so Wilde followed the other crew members into the sea. The engineers opened up the vents so that the diving tanks would be flooded. They then jumped overboard with Lemp, mistakenly believing the U-boat would sink in a matter of minutes. It was only when it failed to sink that Lemp called out to another officer that they should try to climb back on board to see what could be done. But, at that moment, the U-boat was swept beyond their reach. That was the last time anyone saw Lemp. Lieutenant David Balme, who was in charge of the Bulldog's boarding party, sent over to the U-110 in a whaler decided that he should be the first to climb down the conning tower. It takes a particular kind of courage to venture inside a captured submarine. For all he knew, scuttling charges set by the Germans might explode at any minute. As he stepped into its control room, he suddenly felt very lonely and isolated. The interior was tinged with blue by the emergency lighting. Apart from the sound of his own breathing, all Balme could hear was a faint hissing, and the sound of the Atlantic waves lapping against the hull. To his relief, he soon discovered he was alone, and he shouted to the rest of the boarding party to follow him down. While Balme was arranging his men into a human chain so that they could pass all the code-books and charts up the conning tower and into the whaler waiting for them outside, his telegraphist tapped him on the shoulder and said: \"Come and look in the radio room. There's something rather interesting I want to show you.\" On the table in the radio room was a machine like a typewriter. The telegraphist proceeded to show Balme how, when he pressed one letter key on the keyboard, another letter was highlighted on the display panel. Balme instructed the telegraphist to use the screwdriver in his toolbag to undo the four screws securing the machine to the table. Then it, too, was passed up to the deck outside. It took the men about an hour and a half to clear all the books, papers and machinery out of the U-boat. Then Baker Cresswell sent over some sandwiches. Balme settled down to eat his while sitting at Lemp's roll-top desk. Inside the desk, he found an Iron Cross, some pictures of Lemp's family, and a sealed envelope. Balme, who now lives in the south of England, carefully put all three items into his pocket before returning to the Bulldog. The next morning the U-boat sank. Two days later, HMS Bulldog docked in Scapa Flow, the British naval base in the Orkneys. Baker Cresswell was greeted by Allon Bacon, an intelligence officer who was supposed to take the documents down to Bletchley Park, the code-breaking centre. \"Never mind about losing the U-110,\" Bacon said. \"From our point of view, it was a good thing, as we can now keep all this quiet. For God's sake never breathe a word about this to anyone.\" Baker Cresswell replied that he would have to tell the commander-in-chief of the home fleet. \"Yes, of course,\" said Bacon, \"but no one else.\" Bacon was down in London by 6pm on May 13. Three hours later, he was driven through the gates into Bletchley Park. As he walked into the naval intelligence section, he triumphantly held his briefcase containing the most important captured papers over his head, like an athlete who had just won a gold medal. Later that night, as Baker Cresswell sailed back to Iceland, he received the following signal about the operation which had been code-named \"Primrose\" from Sir Dudley Pound, the first sea lord: \"Following from first sea lord. Hearty congratulations. The petals of your flower are of rare beauty.\" He and the rest of the crew were to receive further congratulations from King George VI, who stated that the operation was \"perhaps the most important single event in the whole war at sea.\" The documents and Enigma machine seized from the U-110 did not, in spite of what is stated in the U-571 film and in the TV documentary Station X, recently repeated on Channel 4, help the British code-breakers to break the main naval Enigma code for the first time. That was achieved thanks to the capture of Enigma code-books from a series of German trawlers. Even the capture of the Enigma machine was no help. Other Enigma cipher machines and apparatus had already been captured by the British. But in the envelope seized by David Balme there was something almost as valuable: the settings and procedure to be used for \"Offizier\" Enigma messages, the especially important doubly enciphered messages sent to officers in U-boats while they were at sea. These crucial messages might never have been read by the British had it not been for the capture of the U-110.

      "body": "<p>A wonderful goal from Steve McManaman helped Real Madrid to their eighth European Cup triumph in a final of stunning pace and audacious skills here in the Stade de France. </p> <p>After Fernando Morientes had put Real ahead shortly before half-time Valencia found their best efforts to draw level frustrated by excellent defending. Then in the 67th minute the ball was cleared to McManaman, who from the penalty arc drove a right-footed shot inside the right-hand post to distinguish still further an already outstanding performance.</p> <p>Seven minutes later the contest was finally put beyond Valencia's reach by Raul, who with the opposition crowding forward gathered a pass from Savio, one of the substitutes, and dashed two-thirds of the length of the pitch to score Real's third.</p> <p>Last night's match broke new ground. Never before had teams from the same country contested the European Cup final and Real Madrid and Valencia were not even Spanish champions, either last season or this. </p> <p>The Champions League, in effect, was on trial. A routine fixture had been plucked from the Spanish League and asked to turn itself into a masterpiece. The Spaniards pouring into the Stade de France just wanted to see their side win, but the rest of Europe demanded a spectacle to reflect the undoubted quality which lay in both teams. </p> <p>Certainly Real had little doubt where the route to victory lay. From the outset Vicente del Bosque had Michel Salgado and Roberto Carlos breaking quickly on the flanks from a five-man defence while up front Raul, watched closely by Javier Farinos, tucked himself into pockets of space behind Nicolas Anelka and Fernando Morientes. </p> <p>They also depended on the Argentine might of Fernando Redondo dominating the central areas much as he had done against Manchester United at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Yet a mistake by Redondo, who sold himself in the tackle to let Claudio Lopez through, might have cost Real a goal in the 17th minute. His fellow Argentine set up Mendieta for a low shot which Iker Casillas in the Real goal blocked. </p> <p>Just before that Raul's centre from the left had found the head of Anelka, who nodded the ball goalwards only to see Santiago Canizares touch it over the crossbar. With both teams fully committed to attacking and getting numbers forward chances at either end were always likely.</p> <p>Valencia, if anything, were more inclined to pull players back once they had lost possession. And on their quicker breaks they tended to find more space in the Real half. </p> <p>McManaman, busy, alert and frequently involved in Real's more threatening movements might have provided a goal just past the half-hour. From a throw by Roberto Carlos, Morientes hooked the ball to the former Liverpool forward, McManaman's shot was aimed inside the left-hand post but Canizares kept it out at full stretch. </p> <p>Since Real were pressing home their attacks with greater conviction it was no surprise when they took the lead six minutes before half-time with a cleverly improvised goal which began with a free-kick from Roberto Carlos. </p> <p>For the first time the Brazilian attempted one of his thunderbolts from 35 yards. The shot rebounded to Anelka, who kept possession tenaciously on the right before feeding Salgado, who scooped it towards the far post where Morientes was waiting to head the ball down past Canizares. </p> <p>In anticipation of a Valencia onslaught, Real began the second half defending in depth. Yet when Gerardo failed to control a clearance from Iker Casillas in the 49th minute Anelka was on to the ball in a trice, forcing Canizares to concede a corner in keeping out his shot at the near post.

      "bodyText": "A wonderful goal from Steve McManaman helped Real Madrid to their eighth European Cup triumph in a final of stunning pace and audacious skills here in the Stade de France. After Fernando Morientes had put Real ahead shortly before half-time Valencia found their best efforts to draw level frustrated by excellent defending. Then in the 67th minute the ball was cleared to McManaman, who from the penalty arc drove a right-footed shot inside the right-hand post to distinguish still further an already outstanding performance. Seven minutes later the contest was finally put beyond Valencia's reach by Raul, who with the opposition crowding forward gathered a pass from Savio, one of the substitutes, and dashed two-thirds of the length of the pitch to score Real's third. Last night's match broke new ground. Never before had teams from the same country contested the European Cup final and Real Madrid and Valencia were not even Spanish champions, either last season or this. The Champions League, in effect, was on trial. A routine fixture had been plucked from the Spanish League and asked to turn itself into a masterpiece. The Spaniards pouring into the Stade de France just wanted to see their side win, but the rest of Europe demanded a spectacle to reflect the undoubted quality which lay in both teams. Certainly Real had little doubt where the route to victory lay. From the outset Vicente del Bosque had Michel Salgado and Roberto Carlos breaking quickly on the flanks from a five-man defence while up front Raul, watched closely by Javier Farinos, tucked himself into pockets of space behind Nicolas Anelka and Fernando Morientes. They also depended on the Argentine might of Fernando Redondo dominating the central areas much as he had done against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Yet a mistake by Redondo, who sold himself in the tackle to let Claudio Lopez through, might have cost Real a goal in the 17th minute. His fellow Argentine set up Mendieta for a low shot which Iker Casillas in the Real goal blocked. Just before that Raul's centre from the left had found the head of Anelka, who nodded the ball goalwards only to see Santiago Canizares touch it over the crossbar. With both teams fully committed to attacking and getting numbers forward chances at either end were always likely. Valencia, if anything, were more inclined to pull players back once they had lost possession. And on their quicker breaks they tended to find more space in the Real half. McManaman, busy, alert and frequently involved in Real's more threatening movements might have provided a goal just past the half-hour. From a throw by Roberto Carlos, Morientes hooked the ball to the former Liverpool forward, McManaman's shot was aimed inside the left-hand post but Canizares kept it out at full stretch. Since Real were pressing home their attacks with greater conviction it was no surprise when they took the lead six minutes before half-time with a cleverly improvised goal which began with a free-kick from Roberto Carlos. For the first time the Brazilian attempted one of his thunderbolts from 35 yards. The shot rebounded to Anelka, who kept possession tenaciously on the right before feeding Salgado, who scooped it towards the far post where Morientes was waiting to head the ball down past Canizares. In anticipation of a Valencia onslaught, Real began the second half defending in depth. Yet when Gerardo failed to control a clearance from Iker Casillas in the 49th minute Anelka was on to the ball in a trice, forcing Canizares to concede a corner in keeping out his shot at the near post. This was a match unforgiving of errors and the mere presence of Anelka was enough to panic Valencia's defenders. Shortly before the hour Mendieta attempted to take on a clutch of opponents in the Real penalty area but was dis possessed by a well-judged sliding tackle from McManaman. That moment summed up the spirit and organisation of Real's performance, not to mention the amount of ground covered by McManaman. Still Real looked the more likely scorers. In the 63rd minute Raul unleashed a dipping shot from 30 yards which Canizares did well to keep out. Goalscorers : Morientes 39, McManaman 67, Raul 75. Real Madrid (5-2-2-1): Casillas; Salgado (Hierro, 85min), Ivan Campo, Helguera, Karanka, Roberto Carlos; McManaman, Redondo; Raul, Morientes (Savio, 73); Anelka (Sanchis, 81). Valencia (4-4-2): Canizares; Angloma, Djukic, Pellegrino, Gerardo; Mendieta, Farinos, Gerard, Kily Gonzalez; Claudio Lopez, Angulo. Referee: S Braschi (Italy).",

      "body": "<p>Unilateralism can cut both ways. George W Bush, president presumptive, proposes to do something good with it. He said on Tuesday that the US should make big reductions in its nuclear arsenal, if necessary unilaterally. It didn't matter what Russia did or didn't do alongside.</p> <p>This was a striking novelty from the Republican right. But it was the sweetener for a parallel assertion that would work to opposite effect, which also says that Russia doesn't matter. Come what may, Dubya insists, the US must build its infamous national missile defence system, NMD, to which Russia, not to mention China, or for that matter all of Europe, are rootedly opposed.</p> <p>There's a further sweetener. Europe and Israel, Bush said with a sweep of rhetoric, would be protected as well. It would be an allied matter. Japan could be under cover too. All God's children. This is meant to deflect the widespread affront that Clinton's embryonic version of NMD has given the allies.</p> <p>Bush proposes multilateral benefits. But he doesn't address arguments that persuade sane people this is an insane scheme. Nationalism, not globalism, may be pushing the US towards a misbegotten 21st century destiny. As Europe's custodian of the special relationship, Tony Blair will soon be facing a special challenge to his powers of persuasion, and his courage to dissent.</p> <p>Clinton has been quite slow to push NMD forward. The reasons are hard even for pre- election Democrats to overlook. The technical capacity of the system - one bullet guaranteed to hit another, with no forewarning of its firing, at a closing speed of 10,000mph - is unproven.</p> <p>Star Wars worked only in the movies. So far one test failed, another half-succeeded, a third, serially postponed, is due at the end of July. On this single test hangs Clinton's possible decision, guided entirely by electoral thoughts on behalf of Al Gore, to approve NMD deployment. There are reputable scientists who believe the technical reliability of NMD will never, repeat never, be sufficient to justify the costs.</p> <p>The costs come in two parts. The financial projection, at $60bn, is so immense as to raise serious issues about better means of national, let alone global, defence. Could there not be more potent bangs for the buck? But the diplo-strategic cost is greater still.</p> <p>Seen from Moscow, and indeed from London, NMD bids to be deeply destabilising of the delicate existing architecture of nuclear deterrence. Merely by deciding to deploy - even if the technical capabilities of the system are as fanciful as many serious people believe - Washington will play a dangerous game with the peace of the world.</p> <p>This is the hazard posed by W, or, if you prefer, his novelty. He suggests not only that peace will be better protected against a host of potentially missile-wielding new enemies (North Korea, Iran, Iraq), but that the old enemy can be ignored. The cold war is finished, and with it the thinking that defined Russia as the threat and Soviet-American treaties as the bulwark of peace.</p> <p>Russia, he says along with Richard Perle, is finished. So the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty should be no impediment to NMD. A meticulous article in the new issue of Survival, the journal of the Institute for Strategic Studies, exposes both the illegality and the probable diplomatic aftermath of busting the ABM treaty. But Dubya, backed by Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell and the rest of the old Reagan-Bush galere, is moving on from that tired analysis into a brave new world where the former treaty partner can be dictated to by the American hegemon.</p> <p>This doctrine, the product of ideological triumph and political opportunism, underrates Russian pride and fear alike. Russia's deepest sense of security remains dependent on nuclear deterrence. It would perceive this as being imperilled by an NMD system that could one day, as Vladimir Putin must reckon, be thickened to black out the Urals as well as North Korea, and thus weaken the premise at the heart of the deterrent deal: each side's be lief in its vulnerability to a strike from the other side. Even Zbigniew Brzezinski, no dove he, attacks NMD for the false assumptions its defenders make about Russia, in the name of converting the US into \"an internationally gated community\", building exclusive protection against threats that derive a lot from paranoia.</p> <p>To defend himself against that charge Bush now says he wants to include all allies under the umbrella.

      "bodyText": "Unilateralism can cut both ways. George W Bush, president presumptive, proposes to do something good with it. He said on Tuesday that the US should make big reductions in its nuclear arsenal, if necessary unilaterally. It didn't matter what Russia did or didn't do alongside. This was a striking novelty from the Republican right. But it was the sweetener for a parallel assertion that would work to opposite effect, which also says that Russia doesn't matter. Come what may, Dubya insists, the US must build its infamous national missile defence system, NMD, to which Russia, not to mention China, or for that matter all of Europe, are rootedly opposed. There's a further sweetener. Europe and Israel, Bush said with a sweep of rhetoric, would be protected as well. It would be an allied matter. Japan could be under cover too. All God's children. This is meant to deflect the widespread affront that Clinton's embryonic version of NMD has given the allies. Bush proposes multilateral benefits. But he doesn't address arguments that persuade sane people this is an insane scheme. Nationalism, not globalism, may be pushing the US towards a misbegotten 21st century destiny. As Europe's custodian of the special relationship, Tony Blair will soon be facing a special challenge to his powers of persuasion, and his courage to dissent. Clinton has been quite slow to push NMD forward. The reasons are hard even for pre- election Democrats to overlook. The technical capacity of the system - one bullet guaranteed to hit another, with no forewarning of its firing, at a closing speed of 10,000mph - is unproven. Star Wars worked only in the movies. So far one test failed, another half-succeeded, a third, serially postponed, is due at the end of July. On this single test hangs Clinton's possible decision, guided entirely by electoral thoughts on behalf of Al Gore, to approve NMD deployment. There are reputable scientists who believe the technical reliability of NMD will never, repeat never, be sufficient to justify the costs. The costs come in two parts. The financial projection, at $60bn, is so immense as to raise serious issues about better means of national, let alone global, defence. Could there not be more potent bangs for the buck? But the diplo-strategic cost is greater still. Seen from Moscow, and indeed from London, NMD bids to be deeply destabilising of the delicate existing architecture of nuclear deterrence. Merely by deciding to deploy - even if the technical capabilities of the system are as fanciful as many serious people believe - Washington will play a dangerous game with the peace of the world. This is the hazard posed by W, or, if you prefer, his novelty. He suggests not only that peace will be better protected against a host of potentially missile-wielding new enemies (North Korea, Iran, Iraq), but that the old enemy can be ignored. The cold war is finished, and with it the thinking that defined Russia as the threat and Soviet-American treaties as the bulwark of peace. Russia, he says along with Richard Perle, is finished. So the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty should be no impediment to NMD. A meticulous article in the new issue of Survival, the journal of the Institute for Strategic Studies, exposes both the illegality and the probable diplomatic aftermath of busting the ABM treaty. But Dubya, backed by Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell and the rest of the old Reagan-Bush galere, is moving on from that tired analysis into a brave new world where the former treaty partner can be dictated to by the American hegemon. This doctrine, the product of ideological triumph and political opportunism, underrates Russian pride and fear alike. Russia's deepest sense of security remains dependent on nuclear deterrence. It would perceive this as being imperilled by an NMD system that could one day, as Vladimir Putin must reckon, be thickened to black out the Urals as well as North Korea, and thus weaken the premise at the heart of the deterrent deal: each side's be lief in its vulnerability to a strike from the other side. Even Zbigniew Brzezinski, no dove he, attacks NMD for the false assumptions its defenders make about Russia, in the name of converting the US into \"an internationally gated community\", building exclusive protection against threats that derive a lot from paranoia. To defend himself against that charge Bush now says he wants to include all allies under the umbrella. This notion doesn't appear to have been any more deeply thought out than the wider implications of NMD itself. It is of a piece with the casual opportunism which, in the context of the presidential election, leaves a great and complex issue vulnerable to many transient pressures. Maybe, whoever gets to the White House in November, a few reality-checks, of the technology, the finance and threats, will test NMD to destruction.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of jobs are at risk in the steel industry because of the strong pound and the government's failure to join the euro, union leaders will tell MPs and members of the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly later today. </p> <p>The unions will also urge Corus, the country's main steel producer, to reverse its recent decision to halve the number of shifts at its Workington plant and axe 168 jobs despite winning a \u00a3120m order for rails from Railtrack - the bulk of which will go to Corus's new French plant because of sterling's strength. </p> <p>The AEEU, which claims to be Britain's biggest metals union, is urging government action to secure British steel production and says the strong pound cut the country's steel demand by 10% last year, posing a threat to Corus plants, notably Llanwern and Port Talbot in south Wales. </p> <p>Bob Shannon, the union's national organiser for metals, said last night: \"Steel is a vital industry, employing 60,000 people, but it is under threat from the strong pound. Steel is losing \u00a360m each month in lost export revenue and that means jobs are on the line.\" He added: \"Joining the euro will give steel the stability it needs to invest and plan ahead. We can't afford to wait forever.\" </p> <p>Union sources said the aim of the lobby was to give steel the same high profile recently awarded by ministers to the car industry. </p> <p>Corus, formed from the merger of British Steel and Dutch rival Hoogovens last October, has said that its British operations may have to be \"reconfigured\" if sterling remains so strong. Analysts estimate that every 10 pfennig rise in the pound compared to the German mark costs the group \u00a380m in lost profits each year. </p> <p>In the six months before the merger British Steel lost \u00a3167m, largely because of the pound, but company officials insisted there was no immediate threat to the two Welsh plants which employ 6,500. Corus employs 34,000 in Britain but has shed 9,000 jobs in the past three years to counteract sterling's rise. </p> <p>Mick Leahy, leader of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the main steel union, condemned the decision to transfer the five-year Railtrack work to France as \"absolutely crazy\" and insisted Workington could complete the full order. </p> <p>He insisted the medium-term prospects for the steel industry were more positive than the picture painted by the rival AEEU. \"Our view is that Corus should keep output up to levels before the merger, producing 20m tonnes a year, and should ride the storm, putting pressure on their competitors.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of jobs are at risk in the steel industry because of the strong pound and the government's failure to join the euro, union leaders will tell MPs and members of the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly later today. The unions will also urge Corus, the country's main steel producer, to reverse its recent decision to halve the number of shifts at its Workington plant and axe 168 jobs despite winning a \u00a3120m order for rails from Railtrack - the bulk of which will go to Corus's new French plant because of sterling's strength. The AEEU, which claims to be Britain's biggest metals union, is urging government action to secure British steel production and says the strong pound cut the country's steel demand by 10% last year, posing a threat to Corus plants, notably Llanwern and Port Talbot in south Wales. Bob Shannon, the union's national organiser for metals, said last night: \"Steel is a vital industry, employing 60,000 people, but it is under threat from the strong pound. Steel is losing \u00a360m each month in lost export revenue and that means jobs are on the line.\" He added: \"Joining the euro will give steel the stability it needs to invest and plan ahead. We can't afford to wait forever.\" Union sources said the aim of the lobby was to give steel the same high profile recently awarded by ministers to the car industry. Corus, formed from the merger of British Steel and Dutch rival Hoogovens last October, has said that its British operations may have to be \"reconfigured\" if sterling remains so strong. Analysts estimate that every 10 pfennig rise in the pound compared to the German mark costs the group \u00a380m in lost profits each year. In the six months before the merger British Steel lost \u00a3167m, largely because of the pound, but company officials insisted there was no immediate threat to the two Welsh plants which employ 6,500. Corus employs 34,000 in Britain but has shed 9,000 jobs in the past three years to counteract sterling's rise. Mick Leahy, leader of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, the main steel union, condemned the decision to transfer the five-year Railtrack work to France as \"absolutely crazy\" and insisted Workington could complete the full order. He insisted the medium-term prospects for the steel industry were more positive than the picture painted by the rival AEEU. \"Our view is that Corus should keep output up to levels before the merger, producing 20m tonnes a year, and should ride the storm, putting pressure on their competitors.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair faced renewed pressure yesterday to step up Britain's preparations for the European single currency when a senior Labour backbencher called on the prime minister to set out a timetable for British membership. Voicing the frustration of pro-European cabinet ministers, Martin O'Neill said that Mr Blair should \"clear the air\" at this year's Labour conference and provide a \"definitive statement\" outlining his position on the euro. Mr O'Neill, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, said: \"There could be a problem if, in about six months from now, there has not been a definitive statement by the Labour leadership as to what the government's attitude is going to be on the issue. \"If we don't clear the air in the run-up to a general election, we will find that this will be an issue which will assume a significance that it doesn't merit.\" His remarks, at a press conference organised by the pro-European Britain in Europe group, highlight the growing frustration among pro-European members of the cabinet at Downing Street's failure to take a lead on the euro. The prime minister has said he is in favour in principle of joining a successful euro, but will wait until after the next election to decide whether Gordon Brown's five economic tests have been met. Mr O'Neill said that business could not wait that long and the government should make clear this autumn whether the British economy is beginning to meet the tests. \"There is a point where governments have nowhere else to hide, and they have to come out and state their position in relation to the next phase of the European project,\" he said. \"It is the prerogative of politicians to duck and dive and that has happened in the Labour party.\" Mr O'Neill's intervention came amid signs of a growing cabinet rift over British preparations for the euro. The pro-European Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, last week said that nothing could be done to help exporters hit by the high level of the pound until Britain joined the euro. Stephen Byers, the pro-European trade and industry secretary, waded into the row when he said the government should guard against a drift back to a \"wait and see\" position.",

It arrived as a Visual Basic Script (.vbs file), and any computer that runs VB scripts was and is potentially vulnerable, whichever email software is installed. The obvious response is to remove the software that runs VB scripts, and Roger Giles is not the only reader who asked how to do this. </p> <p>Although removing the Windows Scripting Host (WSH) software is a good idea for most people, it also removes the program's benefits as well. For example, the synchronisation programs that enable handheld computers to update desktop PCs (and vice versa) may be affected. </p> <p>WSH is installed as part of Microsoft Windows 98 and Internet Explorer 5, and can also be downloaded from Microsoft's website. </p> <p>To disable WSH in Windows 98, select Start|Settings| Control Panel and double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon. Click on the tab for Windows Setup, select Accessories, and double-click to expand the section. Find the entry for Windows Scripting Host and click the check box so that it is not selected. Then click OK. </p> <p>If you have installed WSH with Internet Explorer 5 or downloaded it, you can simply disable VBS scripting. Double-click the My Computer icon to open a window on your desktop and select View|Options. Click on File Types in the resulting tabbed dialogue box, then scroll down to the bottom.

Roger Giles rogermg@lineone.net Jack Schofield: The Love Bug virus that swept the world exploited a feature of Windows insecurity that most people didn't know they had. It arrived as a Visual Basic Script (.vbs file), and any computer that runs VB scripts was and is potentially vulnerable, whichever email software is installed. The obvious response is to remove the software that runs VB scripts, and Roger Giles is not the only reader who asked how to do this. Although removing the Windows Scripting Host (WSH) software is a good idea for most people, it also removes the program's benefits as well. For example, the synchronisation programs that enable handheld computers to update desktop PCs (and vice versa) may be affected. WSH is installed as part of Microsoft Windows 98 and Internet Explorer 5, and can also be downloaded from Microsoft's website. To disable WSH in Windows 98, select Start|Settings| Control Panel and double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon. Click on the tab for Windows Setup, select Accessories, and double-click to expand the section. Find the entry for Windows Scripting Host and click the check box so that it is not selected. Then click OK. If you have installed WSH with Internet Explorer 5 or downloaded it, you can simply disable VBS scripting. Double-click the My Computer icon to open a window on your desktop and select View|Options. Click on File Types in the resulting tabbed dialogue box, then scroll down to the bottom. Select the VBScript Script File entry, and click on the Remove button. If there isn't an entry, don't worry about it. This approach should also work with other versions of Windows, including Windows 98. Please note that disabling WSH and/or VBS will not prevent any email program from downloading viruses sent as attachments, and it will not stop you from running them. In fact, it just makes it more likely that the next virus will use a different type of file instead. But while disabling VBS will not protect you fully, it will help protect other people: viruses will no longer be able to run a VB script that exploits the Microsoft Outlook address book to email themselves to everyone you know.

It rated all three councils as poor but singled out Bradford as requiring the most urgent action.</p> <p>Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, said the inspections had revealed \"an ingrained culture of failure and hopelessness\" in all three areas.</p> <p>The Yorkshire council - a hung council with a Conservative leader - now faces virtually all of its services being handed over to the private sector. Its problems were attributed mainly to \"poor political and professional leadership ... over many years\".</p> <p>Consultants will also be sent in over the coming weeks to Waltham Forest and Rochdale, in Lancashire, both Labour controlled. All three authorities said yesterday they would work closely with the contractors to bring about progress.</p> <p>Ofsted started statutory inspections of all local authorities in England two and a half years ago as part of Labour's drive to raise school standards, and has now inspected around half of them, 75 in total. Yesterday it published six reports on individual authorities.</p> <p>Conservative run Kensington and Chelsea in west London received a glowing verdict. In central London, Conservative controlled Westminster was found to have \"more weaknesses than strengths\", with particular problems turning around standards in its secondary schools.

      "bodyText": "The government is to send private consultants into three more \"failing\" local education authorities, it said yesterday, in an extension of its schools privatisation programme. The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, said consultants would be sent into the authorities in Bradford, Rochdale and Waltham Forest, north-east London, to advise on how improvements could be made after government inspectors uncovered \"serious weaknesses\" in their work. The office for standards in education yesterday published its findings. It rated all three councils as poor but singled out Bradford as requiring the most urgent action. Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, said the inspections had revealed \"an ingrained culture of failure and hopelessness\" in all three areas. The Yorkshire council - a hung council with a Conservative leader - now faces virtually all of its services being handed over to the private sector. Its problems were attributed mainly to \"poor political and professional leadership ... over many years\". Consultants will also be sent in over the coming weeks to Waltham Forest and Rochdale, in Lancashire, both Labour controlled. All three authorities said yesterday they would work closely with the contractors to bring about progress. Ofsted started statutory inspections of all local authorities in England two and a half years ago as part of Labour's drive to raise school standards, and has now inspected around half of them, 75 in total. Yesterday it published six reports on individual authorities. Conservative run Kensington and Chelsea in west London received a glowing verdict. In central London, Conservative controlled Westminster was found to have \"more weaknesses than strengths\", with particular problems turning around standards in its secondary schools. At the same time, Labour led Luton in Bedfordshire was described as having made \"uneven\" progress. Ms Morris yesterday defended the government's decision to take action \"quickly, firmly and urgently\" in the case of the three failing authorities. \"In Bradford we are not prepared to accept an option that leaves the LEA in charge of education services,\" she said. \"The Ofsted report makes clear that the education services in Bradford are failing children and not supporting schools. The council is performing many of its responsibilities unsatisfactorily.\" She admitted that \"most, if not all\" of Bradford's education services were likely to be contracted out to the private sector. Mr Woodhead said that he was surprised and disappointed that there were still so many town halls letting down their local schools and communities. The latest action by the government brings to 15 the number of authorities in which ministers have recommended intervention. Last week the government announced that it had extended its list of approved consultants and providers in anticipation of the demand for further inverventions. Ms Morris said: \"We are not in this for the short term or the quick headlines. What we want is irreversible change, and we will not leave any of these LEAs until we have got that. There will be no slipping back when we have finished.\" Useful link Office for standards in education",

The prospect of private consultants moving into parts of the LEA also has backing from the heads, who reluctantly agree the authority is incapable of turning things round on its own. Kensington: Council's great expectations aid success When Chris Woodhead said that Kensington and Chelsea showed what it was possible to achieve in \"very difficult urban circumstances\", his words would have raised eyebrows among those who had only seen the borough's very visible affluence.

Just over half the borough's children are educated privately, removing at a stroke most of the wealthiest parents from its state schools. Jan Bentley, head of the 270-pupil Fox primary, said hers is a very mixed school. \"There are 30% of pupils who are entitled to free school meals. About 30% are bilingual.

      "body": "<p>Shortly before he was elected MP for Tottenham in 1987, the late Bernie Grant was interviewed in the presence of his partner, Sharon. Bernie said the most important message his victory would send to black people around the country was one of \"self-respect. Young blacks need somebody they can look up to as a black.\"</p> <p>\"They're thirsting for a figurehead,\" added Sharon.</p> <p>More than a decade later, following Grant's sudden death in March, Tottenham is once again looking for a \"figurehead\" to send to Westminster. And once again race is high on the agenda.</p> <p>Of the four candidates shortlisted for the Labour ticket there are two frontrunners. On one side stands Grant's widow, Sharon - a white woman with whom he worked closely and who wishes to continue and build on her husband's legacy.</p> <p>On the other is one of the \"young blacks\" to which Bernie Grant was referring - a 27-year-old barrister called David Lammy who grew up in Tottenham and went to Harvard, via a boarding school.</p> <p>The ramifications go far beyond north London. At stake is the shape of any future debate on black representation in parliament and arguably the political legacy of one of the nation's most popular MPs.</p> <p>Supporters of both camps say the decision, which will be made by Labour party members in Tottenham this evening, will be close. Transfers from the other two candidates - Shahid Malik, a Haringey council policy officer, and Sabena Khan, who comes from outside the borough - could prove crucial.</p> <p>Mr Lammy, who was elected to the Greater London Authority earlier this month, is expected to emphasise his youth, his roots in the area and argue that it is time for change. Ms Grant will stress her track record in working alongside Bernie Grant and her ability to follow through on the work he started.</p> <p>Mr Lammy's detractors have attempted to brand him a \"Millbank stooge\" - a slick, media-friendly candidate who will represent the interests of the Labour party leadership rather than the people of Tottenham. But while he is certainly the candidate favoured by the Labour party hierarchy, they have been keen not to be seen to interfere.</p> <p>\"There's no doubt that they want Lammy to win,\" said one senior Labour source. \"But they know that if they make their support too obvious or look heavy-handed that it will be counter-productive. They've learned their lesson with Frank Dobson.\"</p> <p>Ms Grant's critics say she is too leftwing and lacks the personal following that Bernie Grant built up over many years. \"We do not inherit seats in the Labour party, we fight for them,\" said one local member.</p> <p><b> Track record</b><br></p> <p>\"Bernie Grant had a lot of fine qualities and was very popular but we still have the bad housing and high unemployment here that we've always had. We need someone that ministers are going to listen to.\"</p> <p>But despite her left-leanings, Ms Grant reportedly outshone the other candidates at the interview stage. \"She's been in the party long enough to know how to play the game,\" said one Labour insider. \"She was well-rehearsed and they couldn't point to any disloyalty in her track record.\"</p> <p>While the votes will not divide on strictly racial lines, anecdotal evidence suggests that Ms Grant has attracted considerable backing from black and Asian members of the party, while Mr Lammy is expected to receive the support of a large section of white members.</p> <p>Stafford Scott, a black community worker who was heavily involved in the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign, says he is supporting Ms Grant \"after a lot of soul searching\".</p> <p>\"We've argued the need for black representation but many of the arguments being put forward in favour of Lammy are tokenistic,\" he said. \"We're more worried about the quality of representation than the colour of it. Lammy's a nice bloke but he's as different to me as any white, middle class candidate.\"</p> <p>But others insist that to elect Ms Grant would be to dwell on the past rather than look to the future. \"Bernie was a great MP but we should not be trying to find a new Bernie,\" said Alan Stanton, a local councillor and former constituency secretary who is white and supporting Mr Lammy.</p> <p>\"David is bright, determined, energetic. We do need a black MP. They don't just have to be black, they have to be good as well. But we do need someone who is going to represent the multicultural nature of our community and provide role models for kids.\"</p> <p>With almost 40% of the population belonging to ethnic minorities, Tottenham remains one of the most racially diverse constituencies in the country. It is home to a large Cypriot community as well as a significant proportion of people of West African origin.</p> <p>The Broadwater Farm estate, notorious after the uprisings of 1985, shows just how much has changed and how much remains the same. The estate, which houses 3,500 people from 39 different nations, is enjoying a \u00a333m facelift and was recently singled out in a government report on neighbourhood management. A huge mural of a waterfall greets you as you enter and concierges on many of the blocks.</p> <p>It used to be branded the \"estate of death\"; last year the News of the World hailed its \"astonishing turnaround\" as a \"miracle\". But unemployment, at 40%, remains high and buses refuse to go there, preferring to stop at the top of the road.</p> <p><b> Representative</b><br></p> <p>Pastor Kweku Frimpong-Mason, the chairman of the tenants' association, says the race of the MP who follows Bernie Grant is irrelevant. \"We don't talk about black and white here,\" he said. \"We talk about people who can serve the people. We need someone who can represent the whole community.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere in the constituency racial tensions remain acute. \"Bernie represented us because he was black and he knew how we felt,\" said Nigel Taylor. \"I don't know anything about his wife but if she's white then she doesn't know what it's like being black in London.\"</p> <p>Those who back Mr Lammy say that the failure to replace Bernie Grant with another black candidate in a constituency like Tottenham would represent a significant setback in the Labour party's professed desire to see more black MPs.</p> <p>There are only nine black and Asian MPs (eight Labour and one Tory) - a quarter of what there should be if the Commons were to be truly representative. And in the newly devolved bodies the story is even bleaker, with no ethnic minorities in the Scottish and Welsh assemblies and only two in London, where a quarter of the electorate is black or Asian.</p> <p>\"Our new democracies have been ethnically cleansed,\" wrote the Labour chairman of the GLA, Trevor Phillips, in the Observer this week.</p> <p>But even these small numbers represent a significant improvement on 1987 when Bernie Grant, Diane Abbot, Keith Vaz and Paul Boateng became the first black MPs in Britain for more than 60 years.</p> <p>Bernie Grant inherited a majority of 9,936 and doubled it in 10 years. He is referred to simply as \"Bernie\" and all, white and black, say he stood up for Tottenham. \"What we need,\" said one resident of Broadwater Farm who refused to be named, \"is someone who will put their career on the line if necessary. Bernie stuck his neck out for us.\"</p> <p>Bernie Grant shot to prominence two years before his election in the wake of the murder of PC Blakelock. Famously mis quoted as saying \"the police got a bloody good hiding\" (he actually said \"the youth think they gave the police a bloody good hiding\"), he immediately became tabloid fodder: Barmie Bernie of the loony left.</p> <p>In the last interview that he gave he described his struggle to be nominated MP for Tottenham as the \"most stressful part of my life.

      "bodyText": "A Chilean court has stripped Augusto Pinochet of his immunity from prosecution, raising expectations that the senator may face trial charged with human rights abuses. Santiago's appeal court ordered that their landmark decision be kept secret for at least a week, but Chile's newspapers yesterday reported that the judges voted by 13 to 9 to lift the immunity which Gen Pinochet accorded himself when he changed the country's constitution in 1980. For years Gen Pinochet, who overthrew President Salvador Allende in a bloody coup in 1973, has been seen as untouchable in Chile. The military continues to put pressure on the country's courts to retain that immunity. President Ricardo Lagos has refused to comment on the court decision until it is made public, but he warned the military and their rightwing allies that the country would not tolerate interference in the affair. The decision lifts the legal barriers to investigation of the former dictator's role in the disappearance and presumed murder of more than 1,200 opponents of military rule. \"Now we are opening the path of truth and justice,\" said Carmen Hertz, a human rights lawyer who lost her husband to Pinochet's security forces. Gen Pinochet, 84, learned of the decision at his residence on the outskirts of the capital. It may take up to two weeks for the vote to be formalised, after which his lawyers will have five days to appeal to the Chilean supreme court. Without immunity, Gen Pinochet could be prosecuted for 108 different criminal complaints lodged against him. The state defence council, which participated in the effort to remove Gen Pinochet's immunity, has begun to investigate several high profile murders committed during the 1973-1990 dictatorship. The cases include the mur ders of the labour leader Tucapel Jimenez in 1987 and the investigative reporter Jose Carrasco in 1986. The most advanced case against Gen Pinochet is that of the \"Caravan of Death\" in which 72 political activists were hauled from their jail cells and executed. Before any inquiries can proceed, however, there are numerous hurdles. The former dictator's lawyers are expected to argue that he is too sick to mount a responsible and effective defence. The decision to strip Gen Pinochet of immunity was made after growing pressure on a frail Chilean justice system. After showing little interest in human rights cases for 27 years the judiciary was forced to take the case seriously after the general returned from London in March. The vote, called by Ruben Ballesteros, president of the Santiago appeal court was widely interpreted as pre-emptive move against the right wing and the military, both of which have been making public noises about the \"the mistaken and unjust\" treatment of Gen Pinochet. On May 19, military leaders issued a communique reminding the public that the constitution cedes them the right to be \"the guarantors of the country's institutional order\". The declaration also asked the state and the public to work with \"even-handedness\" in civilian military issues. President Lagos viewed the statement as a threat against a government decision to let the courts resolve the case of Gen Pinochet and other human rights issues. Just hours before the leaked announcement of the court vote, President Lagos said in a national radio interview: \"We are in a democratic country and the decisions of the courts are going to be respected and adhered to - by everyone.\"",

For their part in hastening the collapse of the SLA, Hizbullah guerrillas also received the blessings of the Hamas spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. From the Palestinian-controlled territory of Gaza, the disabled cleric said the past 48 hours had been an inspiration for Hamas's rejection of a negotiated peace with Israel. \"We in the Hamas Islamist Movement in Palestine look to this victory as a victory for Islam and Muslims in Palestine and everywhere,\" he said in a letter to the Hizbullah leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah. But some still seemed to be oblivious to the change in circumstances. Yesterday, the erstwhile commander of the SLA, General Antoine Lahad, immaculate in a freshly starched periwinkle blue shirt, dawdled over lunch in the restaurant of the Cedars Hotel in Metulla while a bodyguard kept back reporters.

The land grab, which effects up to 841 white farms worth \u00a3108m, could come as early as next week unless Britain offers an improved compensation package. The attorney general, Patrick Chinamasa, said the list of farms slated for seizure might be released tomorrow. The Commercial Farmers Union, which represents Zimbabwe's 4,500 mainly white farmers, also put the onus on Britain when it appealed yesterday to the international community, especially Britain, to make funds available so farmers would be compensated for properties seized. But the Foreign Office was uncompromising yesterday, insisting there will be no more cash and that it did not intend being held hostage. The Foreign Office minister Peter Hain, who has been an outspoken critic of Mr Mugabe, said: \"This act is calculated to raise the temperature. It is in nobody's interest. \"We are extremely concerned that President Mugabe may be preparing to take land quickly and without compensation under this act.\" Mr Mugabe's latest move came amid increased violence in the run-up to parliamentary elections on June 25 and 26. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change claimed yesterday death squads had been set up to eliminate its candidates, and there were reports of election monitors being beaten up. The MDC secretary general, Welshman Ncube, alleged that members of Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party had been given special paramilitary training at Zimbabwean army headquarters in Harare and deployed for \"Operation Tsuro\" - the systematic elimination of the opposition party's candidates. Operatives had been told \"if you get the opportunity to kill them and you can get away with it, you should do so,\" said Mr Ncube. Mr Mugabe, who claimed Britain has reneged on promises to fund land com pensation schemes, used his sweeping powers to amend the Land Acquisition Act, giving his government the authority to seize white-owned farmland for redistribution to poor blacks. The alterations were published in a special government gazette, the presidential press secretary, Munyaradzi Hwengwere, confirmed yesterday. The new law was made possible by a constitutional amendment pushed through parliament on April 6. Mr Mugabe is hoping the seizure of the white-owned farms will help his Zanu-PF party regain the support of the country's poor rural blacks. Mr Mugabe's backers have already invaded more than 1,300 farms and are claiming them as their own. The official confiscation of 841 farms will make them government properties. Mr Mugabe could then move poor blacks onto the seized farms before the parliamentary elections. The president of the Commercial Farmers Union, Tim Henwood, said his organisation opposed the seizure of the 841 farms, but he appealed to the international community for help with funding. \"The international community could make funds available for a proper resettlement programme, in which farmers would be fully compensated for their land,\" he said. \"It would be helpful if Britain were to come to the table and participate.\"",

President Hafez al-Assad is a famously cautious man and he will need a little time to weigh up the dynamics of the new situation. Israel, meanwhile, has lost no time in warning of the consequences if he fails to restrain the Hizbullah guerrillas in Lebanon. On the Syrian side, a statement in yesterday's issue of Tishreen, the official daily, sounded ominous. \"There will be no peace with Israel until it pulls back its troops to the [pre-war] June 4 1967 line.\" This is standard fare and \"no peace\" does not necessarily mean war: since the military disengagement of 1973, Syria and Israel have not exchanged a single bullet. More significantly, the statement went on to say: \"The Israeli retreat and defeat in Lebanon came as a result of the Syrian-Lebanese struggle.\" In other words, Syria is treating the withdrawal as a partial victory - which probably means that it sees no need for immediate action. As the last Israeli troops moved out, Syria pointedly announced that its foreign minister, Farouq al-Shara, had spoken to Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, by telephone and that both had \"affirmed the necessity of assuring citizens in south Lebanon and avoiding military escalation\". One view of Syria's position is that it now faces a serious dilemma because, with the Israeli withdrawal, it has lost its best bargaining chip. According to this view, Syria's bargaining power with Israel rested until this week mainly on its hegemony in Lebanon, which it could have used, in the context of a broader deal, to help Israeli forces leave the south and guarantee border security afterwards. Probably in the hope of nudging President Assad towards the negotiating table, Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, announced that his forces would leave Lebanon with or without Syrian cooperation.

      "body": "<p>They arrived with lists of schools, businesses and individuals suspected of supporting the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and began hunting them down.</p> <p>They took over the town's secondary and primary schools and dragged the teachers from their classrooms. Some teachers accused of being MDC supporters were stripped naked in front of their students. Many were beaten, some unconscious. Several teachers were hospitalised and three headmasters are still missing.</p> <p>By the standards of Zimbabwe's increasingly brutal election campaign, Chimanimani got off lightly at the weekend. But the hit squad trained and funded by President Robert Mugbe's ruling Zanu-PF had done its job.</p> <p>Today, Chimanimani, a quiet, prosperous town on Zimbabwe's eastern mountains is half deserted. Most people avoid speaking to outsiders.</p> <p>The campaign is called \"Operation Tsuro\" after the rabbit or hare, which Shona people believe to be a particularly intelligent animal. The hit squad has been trained to burn, bludgeon, torture and kill to get Zimbabweans to support Zanu-PF.</p> <p>Next stop on the gang's tour was the Border Timbers estate and lumber mill. After several workers were beaten and management was threatened, the company decided to close down all operations. Border Timbers employs 3,500 people and had export orders worth US$18m (\u00a311m) last year. The company has since re-opened.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's men also in vaded the farm of the MDC parliamentary candidate for Chimanimani, Roy Bennett. In response to death threats, Mr Bennett said he would rather give up his farm than his allegiance to the MDC. But he left Chimanimani with his wife, Heather, after the war veterans had held her hostage for several hours.</p> <p>Mr Bennett tried to return to his farm yesterday, but he was warned by police that the occupiers were armed and would shoot him dead.

      "bodyText": "They arrived with lists of schools, businesses and individuals suspected of supporting the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and began hunting them down. They took over the town's secondary and primary schools and dragged the teachers from their classrooms. Some teachers accused of being MDC supporters were stripped naked in front of their students. Many were beaten, some unconscious. Several teachers were hospitalised and three headmasters are still missing. By the standards of Zimbabwe's increasingly brutal election campaign, Chimanimani got off lightly at the weekend. But the hit squad trained and funded by President Robert Mugbe's ruling Zanu-PF had done its job. Today, Chimanimani, a quiet, prosperous town on Zimbabwe's eastern mountains is half deserted. Most people avoid speaking to outsiders. The campaign is called \"Operation Tsuro\" after the rabbit or hare, which Shona people believe to be a particularly intelligent animal. The hit squad has been trained to burn, bludgeon, torture and kill to get Zimbabweans to support Zanu-PF. Next stop on the gang's tour was the Border Timbers estate and lumber mill. After several workers were beaten and management was threatened, the company decided to close down all operations. Border Timbers employs 3,500 people and had export orders worth US$18m (\u00a311m) last year. The company has since re-opened. Mr Mugabe's men also in vaded the farm of the MDC parliamentary candidate for Chimanimani, Roy Bennett. In response to death threats, Mr Bennett said he would rather give up his farm than his allegiance to the MDC. But he left Chimanimani with his wife, Heather, after the war veterans had held her hostage for several hours. Mr Bennett tried to return to his farm yesterday, but he was warned by police that the occupiers were armed and would shoot him dead. His once prosperous coffee farm is now a shambles from looting and destruction. Many of his 600 workers have been badly beaten. \"The war veterans intimidated everyone in the town,\" said a local woman.\"Tellers at the bank, workers at Zesa [the state electric power company], the post office and the PTC [the phone company] were all threatened and followed when they went home from work. Some were beaten and their homes ransacked.\" The police have promised to protect people from violence, even if it comes from visiting thugs from Zanu-PF, but things have not returned to normal in Chimanimani. There are no tourists and the normally popular hotels and lodges are empty. At the weekend people were told to attend a rally for the Zanu-PF parliamentary candidate, Munacho Mutezo. About 2,000 showed up, many in vehicles commandeered from Mr Bennett's farm. Mr Mutezo, the chairman of Time Bank in Harare, made a big show of the MDC T-shirts and membership cards, which he said had been \"surrendered\" by people at the rally. \"There are hundreds here who have rejoined Zanu-PF,\" Mr Mutezo said. \"People are deserting the MDC for Zanu-PF out of free choice.\" The intimidation of Chimanimani is not an isolated incident. Zanu-PF has sent squads to Kariba, Mutoko, Murehwa and Masvingo and other provincial centres.

      "bodyText": "Ministers were yesterday forced on to the defensive over the troubled Millennium Dome as anger mounted among Labour backbenchers, peers and opposition parties. Conservatives in the Lords attacked government handling of the Dome as a \"fiasco that is rapidly becoming a scandal\", while the Liberal Democrats called for the attraction to close early, and the number of mainly Labour MPs demanding a public inquiry into the project's funding rose to 64. But the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, standing in for Tony Blair at prime minister's questions, hailed the Dome \"a success\" as Tories dubbed it a \"monument to the vanity and emptiness of New Labour\". Amid continuing claims that the former British Airways chief, Bob Ayling, forced to quit as chairman of the New Millennium Experience Company board on Tuesday as a condition of another emergency lottery grant, had been made a scapegoat to protect ministers, his successor, David Quarmby, tried to put the attraction's troubled past behind him. A member of the board since February 1997, he said the Dome team was doing a \"terrific job\". Meanwhile, MPs homed in on the culture secretary, Chris Smith's role in granting emergency funding to the Dome. Mr Smith's shadow, Peter Ainsworth, and the Labour MP for Medway, Bob Marshall-Andrews, both claimed the culture secretary's position as head of the Dome's sponsoring department - the Department of Culture, Media and Sport - and chairman of the millennium commission, which funds and oversees the project, represented a conflict of interest. The Conservatives demanded an explanation after it was confirmed that Mike O'Connor, director of the commission, advised members that - according to the narrow criteria on which he was allowed to make a judgment of value for money - he could not recommend the granting of the latest emergency lifeline of \u00a329m to the Dome. He told commissioners that they could still opt to make the grant if they considered other factors such as the cost of shutting down the attraction, estimated at between \u00a3100m and \u00a3200m. Mr Smith then wrote to Mr O'Connor on behalf of the commissioners authorising him to issue the grant. The Tories' deputy leader in the Lords, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, raised the issue of millions of pounds of extra funding in an emergency question. He said: \"This is a fiasco that is rapidly becoming a scandal.\" Lord Falconer, whom Tories and Labour critics argue should take much of the flak for the Dome fiasco, defended the \"worthwhile\" project and said it was necessary to \"rejig plans\" because of an original overestimate on the numbers of visitors. The Dome was still achieving higher visitor numbers than any other paying attraction in the country, he said. The minister, who cancelled a Sky TV appearance today on which he was scheduled to answer questions about the Dome, repeatedly stressed the \"independent\" nature of the millennium commission. Government sources claimed that it was one of the independent commissioners who had first suggested that the latest \u00a329m grant should be conditional upon Mr Ayling's departure, and that the plan had been backed unanimously by the others, who include the former Conservative deputy prime minister and original Dome enthusiast, Michael Heseltine. The government is anxious to repel claims from Labour backbenchers and opposition parties that his sacking was a political manoeuvre by the government to shield ministers from blame. Suggestions by the New Millennium Experience Company that the commission had withdrawn its condition, allowing Mr Ayling technically to resign without being pushed, were denied by the commission yesterday. There were no signs that ministers were prepared to offer any olive branches to those MPs expressing concern, who include the former defence minister, Peter Kilfoyle, and the former deputy chief whip, George Mudie. Mr Blair's spokesman disclosed that the prime minister had spoken to Mr Ayling on Tuesday, after the former British Airways chief's resignation, to thank him for the work he had done on the Dome project.

He went to Newcastle University, then became an engineer. In the late 1980s, he worked on the design of oil rigs but became frustrated with heavy industry and joined Arthur Andersen in 1990 to train as an accountant. Within three years, he was a manager but again, he became restless: \"I was 36 - I was quite an old manager and I was looking at another five or six years to get a partnership.\" </p> <p>Myerscough began searching for a way to \"break away\" and put feelers out to see if he could find a new line of work. Among the people he met through Andersens was Jeffrey Wright, then chairman of KS Biomedix, which was a small business with a promising treatment for rheumatism. </p> <p>\"Jeffrey told me he was looking for a finance director,\" recalls Myerscough. \"I said I didn't know anything about pharmaceuticals - I was an engineer.\" </p> <p>Myerscough eventually agreed to join KS but he warned that he had one or two other irons in the fire, which he was keen to progress with in his spare time. One was his washing machine project, which had begun when a colleague from Andersen's had lunch with the niece of a washing machine repair man. The repair man, it emerged, had been working on prototypes for new machines, without a great deal of success: \"He had a few crude ideas - he's quite a practical chap - he'd been making things in his workshop.\" </p> <p>Myerscough pooled his engineering experience, together with his commercial know-how, with the repair man. Myerscough says: \"The concept of wild flashes of brilliance is completely wrong. You actually have phenomenal setbacks.

Few were enthusiastic so they decided to go it alone, with help from a few private backers. Myerscough says: \"Talking to big organisations can be frustrating for a small company. They don't want to take it until it's been launched and it's proven that consumers like it.\" </p> <p>Myerscough's new-found wealth is unlikely to impress his colleagues at KS Biomedix - its value rocketed earlier this year, as hi-tech shares surged. Chief executive Kim Tan, who owns 67%, is worth more than \u00a3200m. </p> <p>In addition to his two jobs, Myerscough is building his own 68ft wooden boat, named \"Madam\" after his wife. Sitting in Monotub's temporary office in Covent Garden, the company is yet to find a permanent base, Myerscough admits he has a hyperactive streak.

      "bodyText": "Official confirmation that the generation-long decline in the number of trade unionists in Britain is over was given yesterday as the unions gear up to take advantage of the new legal right to recognition, which comes into effect next month. Membership of all unions, including those which are not affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, rose for the first time since 1979, according to the certification officer for trade unions' annual report, bearing out other evidence that the two-decade-long union cull is over. The latest figures from the government's union watchdog showed a 50,581 increase last year, to more than 7.8m, reflecting a more favourable political and industrial climate for trade unionism as well as the overall rise in employment. That is still a long way from the 13.2m peak reached in Margaret Thatcher's first year as prime minister, and the increase is a modest 0.6%, but it was welcomed as good news by the TUC's general secretary, John Monks. He said: \"Unions are now recruiting outside their traditional areas, and our campaigns on behalf of all employees - such as our efforts to get the government to extend parental leave - show that we have as much to offer to employees in new industries as where we have been traditionally strong.\" The upturn reported by the certification officer reflects increases in the number of trade unionists recorded last year in the government's labour force survey and in the TUC's own membership figures. That trend is likely to be given a significant boost in two weeks when the key provisions of the Employment Relations Act come into effect, giving unions the right to get access to non-union companies and negotiate with employers where more than 50% of a workforce are members of the union. Nevertheless, unions still face a formidable challenge rebuilding their strength in the emerging industries and some employers are preparing to adopt American-style union-busting techniques to see off new recognition claims. Last week the law firm Eversheds began a series of trade union regional \"roadshows\" with employers, addressed by US lawyer Alan Lips, warning of the likely impact of the legislation and how to use American experience to \"disincent\" workers from \"considering the need for union representation\".",

Mr Ludeman said passengers would be invited to join \"a stakeholder board\" which would give them a real voice in the running of the railway. The South Central franchise would be renamed Southern Railway. French-owned Connex has put in its \u00a31bn bid to the Strategic Rail Authority - the quango making the final decision. Its plans include increased capacity for the network with 100mph trains between London and the Sussex coast.",

      "bodyText": "Government officials remain too secretive when releasing information to the public, the parliamentary watchdog said yesterday as the Scottish executive and the Welsh assembly challenged Jack Straw's plans for a restricted freedom of information bill. Scottish and Welsh politicians said they planned to press ahead with a much broader definition of what information could be released than that allowed in England. Michael Buckley, the parliamentary ombudsman, demanded that the home secretary take a more liberal view of the release of information on crime prevention and national security, areas where the release of documents faces a blanket ban under the freedom of information bill, now going through the Lords. In three judgments Mr Buckley rebuked the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence for failing to release relatively harmless information - on the grounds that it could reveal operational data on fighting crime or be a threat to national security. The ombudsman's finding against the Home Office is the third within a year. Mr Buckley said: \"The number of complaints coming to me about the refusal to release information remains low. If any lessons are to be drawn from so few investigations, it is, perhaps, that some information in sensitive areas such as crime prevention and national security can be released safely if departments take a realistic view of potential harm in relation to the public interest in disclosure.\" Mr Buckley's report found the Home Office had wrongly with held sections of The Internet Detective, a guide to online crime for criminal investigators. Sections that had already been released to the press were censored, he said, although it was right to withhold those parts that had not already been published. The MoD was the subject of two complaints. In one, it was right to withhold information about nuclear capabilities, security and intelligence matters, but should have issued less sensitive material. In the other, officials who had refused to release information on UFOs relented after the ombudsman intervened and the man making the request agreed to pay for the cost of collating it. In Wales Rhodri Morgan, the first minister, published a consultation document on the freedom of information code, announcing that in Wales government departments would have to prove \"substantial prejudice\" if they wanted to withold information from the public. This will immediately make it more difficult for Welsh departments to withold information than their English counterparts, who merely have to demonstrate \"harm or prejudice\" to stop information being published. The Scottish executive yesterday received widespread backing for a similar decision. Maurice Frankel, the director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said the announcements in Wales and Scotland \"promise a remarkably powerful right of access\". He said Mr Buckley's criticisms \"are significant as crime prevention is covered by class exemption in the bill.

The opening credits roll over a casual murder on the streets of the capital Freetown by a government militiaman patrolling with the UN-backed Nigerian Ecomog troops.

Decisions taken in London and New York that mean horror and starvation on the ground in Sierra Leone are elided with practised ease: President Kabbah talks about combating hunger with a $150m bridge to the airport; rebels behind massacres and mutilations talk haughtily about illegality and injustice. It is soon clear that nothing big ever happens without Britain and the UN's say-so. </p> <p>Only when he has painstakingly shown how Britain in particular, and the international community in general, scuppered a peace agreement four years ago because it did not conform to the small print of that year's big global push for democratisation does Diaz confront us with the results of that high-handedness in the most brutal fashion. </p> <p> A man shot by the Ecomog/UN troops slowly splutters his last alone on a pavement, a corpse burned beyond recognition twitches with life, amputation victims come bearing their hacked limbs, a man is battered to death by a mob, his head impaled on a stick, and then later his penis. Dead children lie rotting in the ruins of their homes, killed by cluster bombs allegedly paid for by Britain and dropped from Ecomog jets. In Africa, it seems the niceties of peacekeeping need not be observed. </p> <p>These scenes, shot by Sorious Samura, a cameraman who worked for the Sierra Leone government until he could no longer square himself with their actions, represent a tiny fragment of the 70,000 people who have died since the UN killed off the last hope that Sierra Leonians might make peace between themselves.

      "bodyText": "Black and Asian activists within the Labour party yesterday joined forces with aspiring women politicians to press their shared demand for a Westminster parliament that accurately reflects the ethnic and gender balance in British society. On the eve of tonight's selection of a Labour candidate to succeed Bernie Grant in the Tottenham byelection, the new grouping known as EQ - for equality - attracted prominent elected politicians to its launch at Westminster, despite the hostility to the venture of senior Labour officials at Millbank. Paul Boateng, who as Jack Straw's deputy at the Home Office is Britain's highest ranking black politician, turned up to showsupport. He told the seven other black and Asian MPs that it was their collective duty to help \"the next generation\" in ways which had been denied to them when they were first elected in 1987. Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North, warned that previous campaigns had made \"tremendous progress\" but mainly for the benefit of white women - the bulk of the 122 women MPs, 101 of them Labour, elected in 1997. Of the 659 MPs there are eight from ethnic minorities, including two women, Ms Abbott and Oona King. But it is widely assumed that the numbers will fall back again if Labour loses marginal seats at the next election. Neither Tories nor Lib Dems have made the same efforts that Labour has to ensure better gender and ethnic balance, in the face of stiff opposition within its own ranks and a legal action which resulted in all-women lists being ruled illegal. At yesterday's meeting, close to the Commons, there were heated calls for quotas, for more working class candidates, and for older candidates - \"This party is saying 'young, young, young',\" complained an Asian barrister - as well as warnings that, unless black youths could be drawn into the political process, they would drift into apathy or into Muslim fundamentalism. \"Party bosses should remember that the number one reason black people don't get involved in politics is because there are so few black MPs,\" said Simon Woolley, the co-ordinator of Operation Black Vote. Trevor Phillips, chairman of the new Greater London assembly, said that he was against targeting seats or quotas, but he was in favour of ensuring that black and Asian people could compete fairly, so that the best candidate would win.",

      "byline": "John Carvel",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>David Blunkett seldom discusses his blindness. Politics is not a handicap race and he is anxious to avoid being patronised by commentators or colleagues thinking they can judge him against standards below those they set for sighted cabinet ministers. So there has been little on record until now to answer the obvious questions about how he manages to stay on top of his job when other ministers over the years struggled to keep up with the flow of reading matter in their departmental red boxes.</p> <p>Yet, to most voters, blindness is Blunkett's most noticeable characteristic, helping to make him one of the most recognised politicians on the front bench. He uses his dog, Lucy, as the foil for many a political joke, interpreting her sleepiness, agitation or chewing of the lead as a response to the inadequacies of opponents' speeches.</p> <p>Blunkett's reticence about his blindness has left untold an important story about the mechanics involved in running his department. However, he gives for this interview a frank assessment of the consequences of holding high office without being able to see. \"Probably my failing is that I feel I need to be on top of things too much,\" he said. \"I've never wanted anybody to say I don't know the facts, or I'm not on top of the portfolio because I can't see. That involves me spending a lot more time on work than I ought to at weekends. It probably makes me a bit antisocial.\" The problem is practical. Blunkett uses Braille for taking notes, sometimes typing them out on his own portable machine. That and Lucy's dog box are among the few personal features in his office on the seventh floor of Sanctuary Buildings, his departmental headquarters in Westminster. If he is making an important policy speech or answering questions where he wants to use particular words or figures, his officials will provide a Braille text. A Braille version of Labour's 1997 manifesto has pride of place on his desk.</p> <p>However, Braille is an unwieldy medium. More than two large cardboard sheets are needed to hold the information that could have been printed on a single side of thin A4 paper. Blunkett would find it hard to carry the number of documents he needs to digest on journeys between London and his Sheffield constituency - let alone find things - if they were all in Braille.</p> <p>The medium is also impractical for speed-reading and does not allow for emphasis by underlining or use of different typefaces. Blunkett has to tear the side of the cardboard sheet as a marker to a passage he may want to refer to during a speech.</p> <p>As a result he chooses to receive most of his information through the earpiece of a tape recorder. Three sets of staff - in the department, his parliamentary office and constituency - have been trained to condense material so that he hears only what he needs to know. He tells them repeatedly that he can always ask for more, but gets no benefit from being given too much.</p> <p>Blunkett listens to these tapes at twice the normal speed. He says the sound he hears when he takes in Cabinet agenda papers, departmental initiatives or constituency casework resembles the soundtrack from an episode of Pinky and Perky, the children's television classic. The minister switches to normal speed only when there are figures he wants to memorise or points he wishes to consider at a slower pace.</p> <p>But even tapes played at double the normal speed are a slow way to assimilate information. He estimates that a reasonably fast reader could take in the same number of words in about a third of the time. The prime minister, who has the speed-reading techniques of the barrister he used to be, is a lot quicker than that.</p> <p>The consequence for Blunkett is an extended working week. He says he is blessed by an ability to take in material as well on a train or car journey as in his office. If, like some of his colleagues, he got travel sickness trying to work on the move, he thinks he would struggle to cope.</p> <p>Such are the downsides of blindness. The upsides lie in the heightened development of other faculties. Ministerial colleagues envy his excellent memory for facts and figures, particularly during public spending negotiations. Relying less on notes, he is better able to marshal arguments when he is required to think on his feet. Blunkett says the technique is job specific. \"It's not that my memory is better than anyone else's. If you asked me to learn a Shakespeare sonnet before cabinet in 30 minutes' time, I wouldn't be able to recite it any better than you. But if you give me a set of figures for presenting at cabinet, I have learned to do that.\"</p> <p>Sir Michael Bichard, his permanent secretary, says that plenty of other ministers and senior officials have good memories. But, however well briefed they are, they take notes into meetings as a \"comfort blanket\". And that may diminish their ability to order arguments. \"Maybe some of us would benefit if the papers were taken away from us,\" he says.</p> <p>Another heightened faculty is Blunkett's sensitivity to the mood of a meeting. Sir Michael says that the minister picks up vibes from changes in the tone of voices which can remain hidden behind facial expressions. Blunkett says he can get it wrong. \"But sometimes I can detect what I call a shuffling silence and can tell people aren't happy.\"</p> <p>At the end of a meeting, Sir Michael might tell Blunkett about a facial expression that would have added to his understanding of a speaker's point of view. \"But almost invariably he will have picked up the point already.\"</p> <p>The good relationship between the two men is clearly pivotal to the department for education and employment's effectiveness and the high regard the prime minister has for its performance. Sir Michael dates it back to their first encounter, lasting one and a half hours when Blunkett made him laugh more than at any other first meeting in his life.</p> <p>They both still dine out on the story of Blunkett's first ministerial presentation to Tony Blair after the election, when the department rushed over notes produced using its newly acquired Swedish Braille software. None of the officials could read what they were sending and it was not until after the meeting had started that Blunkett discovered the computer had translated it into Swedish.</p> <p>Another feature of Blunkett's style of political management is a willingness to delegate to junior ministers and not steal all the limelight when their policies come to fruition. There is more of a sense of teamwork at the DfEE than some other departments and in three years there has been no known example of the juniors rubbishing their boss.</p> <p>Delegation may help to reduce Blunkett's reading overload, but Sir Michael is convinced that it has nothing to do with his blindness. \"His grasp of detail is such that he doesn't have to do it,\" he says. Similarly, the minister's preference for taking lots of decisions at relatively short meetings with a small number of relevant officials has more to do with management style than personal circumstances. \"If he and I sit down for half an hour, we go through a lot of business. That develops a better relationship than exchanging elegantly crafted minutes.\"</p> <p>There may be lessons in all this for other departments that could benefit from more delegation, fewer meetings and cutting down paperwork by more careful summarising. \"He talks about his blindness as an inconvenience rather than a disability,\" says Sir Michael. \"That is what it is. I don't think you could have a secretary of state who is more demanding and more on top of his job. After a while, you don't regard his blindness as a problem, certainly not a disability. We all work hard but he works smart and we have all learned by watching him . . . I think he could do any job in government.\"</p> <p>Blunkett tells jokes about his blindness. He says the great benefit is being able to read in bed without the light on. A favourite story to break the ice at a conference is the one about a visit to a primary school when he sat down to let the children stroke his dog. \"I reached out to touch the one sitting next to me and said: 'How old are you, my dear?' She said, 'I'm 28 and I'm their teacher'.\"</p> <p>Blunkett is thriving on power, but behind the good humour such a workload must be taking its toll. After a long week in London, he heads off to Sheffield with his specially adapted red boxes - enlarged to provide a compartment for Braille notes on one side and tapes on the other. One Saturday, a box was delivered at 8am, with 23 tapes to be dealt with before the start of the following working week. He says he manages. As his career has progressed, the support has improved although there was a dreadful year after he moved from the leadership of Sheffield council to become a Labour MP in 1987 when he struggled without the necessary back-up.</p> <p>He says the financial cost to the DfEE is limited to some computer software, a Braille embosser and a couple of staff in his private office to read material on to tape. The cost to him personally may be greater. He says he tries to keep some degree of balance in his life and make time for his sons. \"But I know I'm spending time on work rather than doing things that would refresh me as a man.\"</p>",

He said that politics was about operating in the real world. He accused anti-agreement Unionists of making the task of his party's leadership more difficult in securing progress on decommissioning. Had they backed him instead of saying there was no requirement on the IRA to do so, progress would have been much faster. Mr Trimble pleaded with those opposed to the IRA deal to rally round after Saturday's vote. Against yesterday's defections, he has the support of assembly member Billy Armstrong, who was opposed to going into government with Sinn Fein in November.",

      "bodyText": "The battle between the Independent Television Commission and ITV has intensified with a condemnation by the regulator of the channel's current affairs and entertainment shows. A week after it rejected ITV's plans to revive flagging ratings for its news programmes, the commission has turned its sights on the rest of the network's output. In its annual review of ITV's performance, published today, the regulator criticises Tonight with Trevor McDonald for relying too heavily on celebrity interviews and lightweight social affairs issues, and says the network's arts and entertainment schedules would have looked thin without the hit game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? The ITC says the channel \"failed to hit top form\" with new arts, comedy and entertainment shows in a year of \"dramatic change\" following the scrapping of News at Ten. The new current affairs show, Tonight, had not yet achieved flagship status, and there was a danger that factual programmes have begun to look the same. After demanding last week that ITV should come up with new ideas to arrest the decline in news audiences, the ITC's second set of stern words is another indication that it is keen to flex its muscles to counter criticism that it has been unwilling to use its powers strongly enough. The commission urges ITV chiefs to maintain high levels of cash investment if they are to reverse failed attempts to find \"new, potentially long-running bankers\". But it is positive about ITV's overall strategy: \"Bold steps were taken, supported by an increased programme budget and increased deployment of marketing techniques to arrest years of audience decline,\" the review says. Sport, children's programmes and drama are highlighted for praise in the report, but the commission expresses dismay at the network's failure adequately to cover major events such as the eclipse and the millennium eve celebrations. ITV's factual programming relies principally on human interest stories, CCTV footage, consumerism and lifestyle shows, such as Parking Wars, Motorway Life and the \"... from hell\" series, resulting in a \"sameness in tone\", the commission says. The distinction between features, documentaries and current affairs had become blurred, it says and it goes on to warn ITV against depriving viewers of variety. ITN's news coverage had, however, remained of high quality. ITV welcomed the broad thrust of the review. \"We are pleased that the ITC has acknowledged that ITV delivered increased range and diversity in its programming last year,\" it said in a statement. \"As the ITC has said, 1999 was a year of dramatic change for ITV when bold steps were taken, supported by an increased programme budget. The ITC recognised in particular much that was new, high quality and wide-ranging in drama, strengthened factual programming, and marked improvements in sport, education, social action and religion.\" The statement added: \"Following the introduction of the new ITV schedule in 1999, ITV increased its peaktime audience share for the first time in seven years. \"An additional \u00a364m was invested in peaktime programming and it is gratifying that the ITC has recognised many of the achievements of ITV's new evening schedule.\" The performance review also assesses each of the 15 regional ITV broadcasters. It expresses dismay that Carlton, which holds three ITV franchises - for London weekday, the midlands and south-west - has imposed its corporate image on each. The loss of the strong local identities built up by Central and Westcountry is disappointing, the report says. Grampian television, owned by the Scottish Media Group, is criticised for failing to mirror the needs of its local audience. The regulator expressed astonishment at the failure to broadcast a separate hogmanay show for the region last year, and said that too many co-productions with the parent company were classed as local programmes. This was not acceptable, and Grampian had agreed to improve its performance this year. Successes and failures of commercial network News While the fall in ratings was unsatisfactory, the \"quality of the ITN service remained undiminished\". Current affairs There is praise for Tonight with Trevor McDonald: a \"genuine attempt to inject new life into mainstream current affairs programming\". But there is \"too great a concentration of lighter treatments and the focus on celebrity interviews tended to provide insufficient depth\". Factual The \"caught on camera\" genre - cheap and easy television - is criticised. But there were a \"a small number of outstanding films\". This Morning remains \"commendably consistent\", and the new daytime talk show Loose Women was praised. Children's programmes The success of the Saturday morning strands SM:TV Live and CD:UK is highlighted, as is strong showings in children's drama, entertainment shows, and pre-school output. Religious ITV made a \"real effort in 1999 to bring fresh ideas to its religious programming\". Drama The new flexibility in the schedule led to more variety, but new series were in familiar settings. There were hits in short series of contemporary drama - Forgotten drew the best debut rating (12m) for such a series, the report said. \"The emergence of some new talent to ITV in terms of writers and actors was welcome.\" Entertainment Millionaire was a hit again. But Give Your Mate a Break and Would I Lie To You? were failures. Comedy was problematic. Sport \"Sport is now one of ITV's strongest programme categories having recovered well from the doldrums of four or five years ago.\" Arts \"ITV's arts policy in 1999 was muddled and lacked sufficient forethought.\" Some programmes were labelled arts shows when they were entertainment. \"The ITC expects to see ITV overhauling its arts policy to meet fully the definition of arts programming.\" Education The education agenda was broadened, and diversity in social action programmes improved.",

Officials admitted that British self-loading rifles could have got into the hands of young boys in the Sierra Leone army, despite assurances by President Ahmed Kabbah that they would only be used by regular soldiers, in accordance with \"human rights standards\". The reports that youngsters were arming themselves with British guns are acutely embarrassing to a government that has repeatedly condemned the use of child soldiers in Africa. The issue is doubly sensitive for ministers who agreed on Tuesday to supply the Kabbah government with a further consignment of weapons, including 10,000 self-loading rifles. After the UN dropped its embargo on arms supplies to Mr Kabbah's forces, Britain shipped \u00a310m worth of weapons to Freetown last year.

There is a consensus that if they are old enough to work and father children, then they are old enough to defend their families from the rebels. The aid agency Cafod warned yesterday that the new supply of British rifles could mean more children being given weapons and being drawn into the fighting. Amnesty called for safeguards to ensure that he British equipment was not used to commit human rights violations, and said that Sierra Leonean personnel given weapons should be trained in international law. Ministry of Defence officials insisted that the new weapons consignment would be subject to \"controlled release under the supervi sion of British officers\" leading the new 90-strong military training mission. Child soldiers \"are obviously something we condemn\". a Foreign Office official said. \"We've worked hard to eradicate the practice wherever we come across it.\". But British officials said the risk that the weapons would get into the hands of children remained. Defence sources in London expressed confidence that Revolutionary United Front rebels were \"in a degree of retreat\", though they remained in force in two areas: the diamond-producing region in the east of Sierra Leone and west and north-west of Freetown. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook said the Government favoured an African peace force for Sierra Leone, with the west in a supporting role behind the scenes. \"European troops in the frontline are not necessarily helpful in achieving reduction in tension,\" he said. \"It is better if the frontline is provided by African troops facing African situations,\" he told the BBC yesterday.",

He is accused of stealing money five years ago from Hobson - a food company of which he was then chief executive. </p> <p>The case revolves around an agreement under which Hobson supplied products to the Co-operative Wholesale Society.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Regan, the Monaco-based entrepreneur who tried to take over the Co-operative Wholesale Society three years ago, yesterday returned to Britain to face a criminal charge of stealing \u00a32.4m. Mr Regan flew to London and gave himself up at Charing Cross police station, where he was arrested and charged with theft. He later appeared in court and was released on \u00a31m bail. Mr Regan, pictured yesterday, has been wanted by the serious fraud office since October. He is accused of stealing money five years ago from Hobson - a food company of which he was then chief executive. The case revolves around an agreement under which Hobson supplied products to the Co-operative Wholesale Society. This contract was extended in 1995 in return for a payment by Hobson of \u00a32.85m. At Bow Street magistrates' court, Mr Regan spoke only once - to confirm his name and his address in Monte Carlo. He was granted a highly unusual bail condition allowing him to return to Monaco until June 20. His lawyer, Julian Bevan, said that he wanted to tie up his business affairs and attend the confirmation of three of his six children in the principality. Beyond June 20, he was told to surrender his passport and stay in London, within the M25. Mr Regan was told to sleep every night at a designated address in south London, and he was also ordered not to contact any potential witnesses in the case. Mr Regan has provided a surety of \u00a3500,000, and his father, former Spring Ram kitchens chairman Roger Regan, has lodged a further \u00a3500,000 security with his law firm. A warrant for Mr Regan's arrest was issued after three other people were charged in September with corruption offences. The three were Allan Green and David Chambers - both former Co-op employees - and Paul Thomas, a former solicitor for Hobson. Mr Regan tried to institute a \u00a31.7bn takeover of the Co-operative Wholesale Society through a vehicle called Galileo. The attempt failed before he had even tabled a formal bid. Mr Regan is represented by Burton Copeland, a law firm which has worked on a series of high profile City cases including the Maxwell affair and the collapse of Blue Arrow.",

The court, which could have refused to extradite the 20-year-old Algerian on the grounds that he faces a stiffer prison sentence in France than the 25-year maximum allowed in Portugal, said only that it had upheld a lower court's decision in March to grant France's extradition request. Lawyers for Mr Rezala, who last week confessed to the killings in an interview with a French news magazine, made no immediate comment on whether they would appeal to Portugal's constitutional court. France, embarrassed by a bungled investigation that allowed Rezala to flee the country last December, had already asked Interpol to issue an international arrest warrant in case extradition was denied. Rezala, arrested in Lisbon in January, is wanted in connection with the murders of Ms Peake, a Birmingham student, Corinne Caillaux, who was stabbed in the toilets of an express, and Emilie Bazin, a former girlfriend.",

      "body": "<p>As a writer, teacher and practitioner, Michael Langford, who has died aged 67, was a major influence on British photography. Joining the Royal College of Art as a photography tutor in 1967, he retired three decades later as a fellow of the RCA. His bestsellers, Basic Photography (1965) and Advanced Photography (1969), are standard texts, still used today, bibles for generations of photographers who owe their careers to his work.</p> <p>He became an RCA senior tutor in 1973, departmental head 12 years later and from 1994 to 1997 he was course director. In the late 1960s I was one of the first half-dozen students recruited on to what was then a new course. With his gentlemanly, silvery ele gance, Langford was an excellent foil for John Hedgecoe, now emeritus professor of photography at the RCA, who founded the photography school in 1965.</p> <p>In those times feminism was no more than a murmur, and the photographic industry a male domain, yet on that unconventional course there were equal numbers of women and men. We were drawn from the disparate worlds of commercial and fine art, and it was testimony to Langford and Hedgecoe that most of us went on to success.</p> <p>Once I anxiously asked Langford how I might metamorphose from graphic design graduate to professional photographer within a two-year course. He smiled graciously. I would soon pick up the technique, he reassured me. \"That,\" he went on, \"is the easy part.\" He conducted us into a darkened studio overlooking Cromwell Road. Facing a window blind pierced by a tiny hole was a white screen, on which the traffic outside appeared, upside-down. \"The principle,\" observed Langford, simply, \"of photography. The pinhole camera.\"</p> <p>Gradually our motley crew became fledgling photographers, but my first colour pictures were a failure. \"Just go back and do it again,\" said Langford. \"That's what we were told in the Royal Air Force when things went wrong. Just try again, please.\" I reshot. All was well.</p> <p>Langford was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School and started his career in Bournemouth aged 16 as a local photographer's apprentice. Two years later, on national service, he was assigned to the RAF photographic section. Then, after a brief spell with a press photography firm, he worked as an industrial photographer while teaching evening classes.</p> <p>In 1959 he took up a fulltime teaching post at Ealing Technical College (now Thames Valley University). Five years later he moved to Birmingham College of Art. Then, in 1967, came the RCA.</p> <p>With hindsight I can see the benefits of disparity in the teaching methods we experienced at the college. Students quickly became tough. It took a degree of resilience to withstand, let alone appreciate, the contrast between Langford's polite phone calls to Harrods to reserve fashion accessories for our studio work and Hedgecoe tearing up prints in the interests of demonstrating \"what really counts in a pitcher!\"</p> <p>Langford never espoused a teaching method, he thought students should develop their own ideas - intuition always taking precedence, perhaps even over rationality. Thirty years after seeing his Cromwell Road go silently by, upside-down in that darkened studio, I am preparing an exhibition of my photographs, just trying again, as he would have appreciated.</p> <p>Langford's 17 books were translated into many languages, and are texts in schools and colleges across the world. He was finishing the seventh edition of Basic Photography - a book originally drawn from his Ealing lectures - just before he died.</p> <p>He leaves his wife Pamela and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095Michael Langford, photographer, teacher and writer, born February 28 1933; died April 28 2000</p>",

He became an RCA senior tutor in 1973, departmental head 12 years later and from 1994 to 1997 he was course director. In the late 1960s I was one of the first half-dozen students recruited on to what was then a new course. With his gentlemanly, silvery ele gance, Langford was an excellent foil for John Hedgecoe, now emeritus professor of photography at the RCA, who founded the photography school in 1965. In those times feminism was no more than a murmur, and the photographic industry a male domain, yet on that unconventional course there were equal numbers of women and men. We were drawn from the disparate worlds of commercial and fine art, and it was testimony to Langford and Hedgecoe that most of us went on to success. Once I anxiously asked Langford how I might metamorphose from graphic design graduate to professional photographer within a two-year course. He smiled graciously. I would soon pick up the technique, he reassured me. \"That,\" he went on, \"is the easy part.\" He conducted us into a darkened studio overlooking Cromwell Road. Facing a window blind pierced by a tiny hole was a white screen, on which the traffic outside appeared, upside-down. \"The principle,\" observed Langford, simply, \"of photography. The pinhole camera.\" Gradually our motley crew became fledgling photographers, but my first colour pictures were a failure. \"Just go back and do it again,\" said Langford. \"That's what we were told in the Royal Air Force when things went wrong. Just try again, please.\" I reshot. All was well. Langford was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School and started his career in Bournemouth aged 16 as a local photographer's apprentice. Two years later, on national service, he was assigned to the RAF photographic section. Then, after a brief spell with a press photography firm, he worked as an industrial photographer while teaching evening classes. In 1959 he took up a fulltime teaching post at Ealing Technical College (now Thames Valley University). Five years later he moved to Birmingham College of Art. Then, in 1967, came the RCA. With hindsight I can see the benefits of disparity in the teaching methods we experienced at the college. Students quickly became tough. It took a degree of resilience to withstand, let alone appreciate, the contrast between Langford's polite phone calls to Harrods to reserve fashion accessories for our studio work and Hedgecoe tearing up prints in the interests of demonstrating \"what really counts in a pitcher!\" Langford never espoused a teaching method, he thought students should develop their own ideas - intuition always taking precedence, perhaps even over rationality. Thirty years after seeing his Cromwell Road go silently by, upside-down in that darkened studio, I am preparing an exhibition of my photographs, just trying again, as he would have appreciated. Langford's 17 books were translated into many languages, and are texts in schools and colleges across the world. He was finishing the seventh edition of Basic Photography - a book originally drawn from his Ealing lectures - just before he died. He leaves his wife Pamela and two daughters. \u0095Michael Langford, photographer, teacher and writer, born February 28 1933; died April 28 2000",

The idea of presenting such a popular selection of artists at Britain's most famous studio belongs to Jim Le Hat, a producer at London Live. </p> <p>\"We had a meeting last November,\" he explains, \"and as a colleague was talking about the Music Live season, I had Abbey Road appear in front of my eyes. Think of a place where so much great music has been made, you have to think Abbey Road. I've been there before so I knew we could set the bands in three different studios and cut between them.\" </p> <p>Ironically, although Abbey Road is indeed the most famous studio in the land, Neil Aldrich, who has worked there for 30 years, says that many people think the studio, following the demise of The Beatles, is now a dusty museum. Nothing could be further from the truth, he insists. </p> <p>Most of its three studios are booked for the year, reflecting the \"quality of the technicians here and their understanding of what people want\". And famous acts who have recorded here recently include Oasis, The Spice Girls, Spiritualized, Dr John and Paul Weller. And, adds Aldrich, a sizeable number of Hollywood film scores have emanated from studios one and two, including the recent Star Wars film, Braveheart, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, The Talented Mr Ripley and Sleepy Hollow. </p> <p>It hasn't always been thus. Built by EMI Records in 1931 to provide a suitable environment in which to record their artists, the studio was never christened Abbey Road. It was only 15 years ago that they officially changed their name from EMI Recording Studios to Abbey Road studios. By then, of course, The Beatles had made the place a landmark. But even they, during their time there, had to put up with an often antiquated and fairly strict regime. </p> <p>Studios which were booked for a certain time-slot rarely allowed bands to go over, let alone miss a day through excessive behaviour the night before. When John Lennon dropped an acid tab one night and started freaking out, producer George Martin quietly ushered him onto the roof to see off the effects of the drug. Meanwhile, downstairs, the engineers wore suits, and the technicians and porters were distinguished, respectively, by obligatory white and brown coats. Everyone had to pay for their tea and biscuits in the canteen, including The Beatles. </p> <p>\"In the early 60s there were very few recording studios,\" Aldrich points out. \"It was a music factory, and certain guidelines were laid down. Many places had executive toilets and the like. Nothing strange, that's how businesses were run. Nowadays those guidelines have been relaxed. Certainly, throughout the 60s, life became far less informal here.\" </p> <p>Indeed, it did. The Sex Pistols mixed their legendary Never Mind The Bollocks here, providing potent symbolism of the new sweeping away the old. Not surprising then that Oasis - Noel Gallagher once joked that they should have been called The Sex Beatles - began recording their third album, Be Here Now, in studio two. Shades of yesteryear occurred when an irate conductor barged into their studio and asked them to, please, keep the noise down. The group decamped to a country studio the very next day. </p> <p>On Monday the proceedings will begin at the distinctly impolite hour of 7.30am and will, hopes Aldrich, display the wide talent that makes up contemporary British pop. The day will end with a 40-minute concert by Paul Weller, tickets for which are to be given away through the radio station. One curious matter is the inclusion of 60s popsters The Move, the only band ever to be sued by a British prime minister, when then manager, Tony Secunda, created a promotional postcard depicting the Labour leader Harold Wilson and his secretary Marcia Falkender in a compromising position.

However, when the people of Sherwood, a residential suburb of Nottingham, discovered last year that they were about to welcome two of Britain's most notorious child-killers into their community, they tried, understandably, to put their collective feet down. </p> <p> <strong> Inside Story</strong> followed the increasingly ugly process of public protest and government indifference, proving once again that you only have to scratch the surface of modern British life to discover deep currents of hatred and fear. Nothing whips up communal blood-lust like paedophilia: at the drop of a hat the merry men and women of Sherwood turned from peaceful bourgeois into a placard-wielding mob. \"They should bring back hanging or the electric chair\", announced one protestor, while the group chanted the hastily composed \"What do we want? No paedophiles! Where don't we want them? Nottingham!\" </p> <p>They had a point, though. Lenny Smith and Robert Oliver are not only paedophiles, but killers. Smith murdered a six-year-old boy; Oliver killed 14-year-old Jason Smith during an orgy. As bogeymen go, they don't get much more terrifying or disgusting than this. The problem is, though, that they've both served their sentences and are now free men. Accommodation has been provided within the walls of Nottingham prison, and the men are free to come and go as they please, albeit with a police escort. </p> <p>The theory may have been sound, but in practice it was a disaster. The flats are 200 yards from an infant school; there's a scout camp just up the road. It's hard to imagine the ideal location for Smith and Oliver to begin a new life in the community, but it couldn't be any worse than this.

      "bodyText": "There are many things we can't choose in this life - our neighbours, for instance. However, when the people of Sherwood, a residential suburb of Nottingham, discovered last year that they were about to welcome two of Britain's most notorious child-killers into their community, they tried, understandably, to put their collective feet down. Inside Story followed the increasingly ugly process of public protest and government indifference, proving once again that you only have to scratch the surface of modern British life to discover deep currents of hatred and fear. Nothing whips up communal blood-lust like paedophilia: at the drop of a hat the merry men and women of Sherwood turned from peaceful bourgeois into a placard-wielding mob. \"They should bring back hanging or the electric chair\", announced one protestor, while the group chanted the hastily composed \"What do we want? No paedophiles! Where don't we want them? Nottingham!\" They had a point, though. Lenny Smith and Robert Oliver are not only paedophiles, but killers. Smith murdered a six-year-old boy; Oliver killed 14-year-old Jason Smith during an orgy. As bogeymen go, they don't get much more terrifying or disgusting than this. The problem is, though, that they've both served their sentences and are now free men. Accommodation has been provided within the walls of Nottingham prison, and the men are free to come and go as they please, albeit with a police escort. The theory may have been sound, but in practice it was a disaster. The flats are 200 yards from an infant school; there's a scout camp just up the road. It's hard to imagine the ideal location for Smith and Oliver to begin a new life in the community, but it couldn't be any worse than this. Concerned residents set up a tent outside the prison gates and began collecting signatures for a petition. Sadly, but inevitably, it all fell to pieces within weeks. The Home Office ignored the petition; the protesters fell out, divided between those who believed in the democratic process and those who preferred screaming in the streets and pushing their children in front of cameras.

      "bodyText": "Plans to beef up the European Union's defence capability should not worry the United States and will not undermine the western alliance, Nato's secretary general, Lord Robertson, declared yesterday. As the US urged Nato's European members to do more to help keep the peace in Kosovo, Lord Robertson sought to assuage America's fears that the EU might be striking out on its own. \"The Americans appreciate that what is happening here is a rebalancing of the alliance and a strengthening of European capabilities,\" he said, at the opening of a Nato ministerial meeting in Florence. Brussels, which is trying to give the EU some military muscle to match its economic weight, has had to focus much of its efforts on keeping the Americans happy. On Monday the EU political committee approved a framework for future relations with Nato. That document will be presented to the EU summit in Portugal next month. In Helsinki last December EU leaders promised to develop rapid-reaction capability so that by 2003 up to 60,000 troops could be swiftly deployed and kept in place for up to a year. But fears have been expressed in the United States that the end result could undermine Nato. On two committees now up and running in BrusselsEU diplomats and soldiers are looking at military matters for the first time. Both are directly answerable to the EU's foreign and defence policy supremo, Javier Solana, himself a former Nato chief. \"If the Europeans strengthen their capabilities, that would be a win-win situation ... because the alliance will get the benefit of these capabilities and the US will not be dragged into every tiny conflict or crisis that the Europeans could handle for themselves,\" Lord Robertson said. But mutual frustrations were underlined in Florence when Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, urged her European colleagues to send more personnel to the under-strength police force in Kosovo. Mrs Albright said she knew the Europeans were doing their fair share, but the Clinton administration needed their help to prove this to Congress, which has threatened to make funding for Kosovo conditional on European contributions. The US covered most of the costs of last year's Nato bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, but the European allies have taken the lead in paying the cost of reconstruction and civilian administration. Meanwhile the Americans have been working hard on another contentious transatlantic issue - trying to persuade the Europeans of the need for the new national missile defence programme, which is aimed at knocking down incoming missiles launched by rogue states. Russia and China strongly oppose the programme, and many of the allies also remain unconvinced that it is needed. Frosty exchanges were predicted with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, who is resuming talks with Nato after a year-long gap because of tension over Kosovo. Nato is angry because of Russia's recent decision to hold formal talks with General Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav defence minister, who was indicted last year by the Hague war crimes tribunal, like President Slobodan Milosevic and other senior officials. Under binding UN security council resolutions, Russia should arrest any indictees who enter its territory. \u0095The European Commission has approved plans to spend up to 22m euros (\u00a313.5m) to help clear the river Danube of debris and unexploded shells from Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia. The money will be used to clear the debris of three bridges destroyed in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad, but not to pay for rebuilding the bridges.",

      "bodyText": "A former nanny for Vogue's British editor, Anna Wintour, claims to be an innocent victim of the \"fur wars\" between animal rights protesters and the editor She says she was left with \"permanent neurological injuries\" in the wake of a graffiti attack by anti-fur militants on Ms Wintour's New York home. Lori Feldt is suing the publisher of Vogue, Cond\u00e9 Nast, for $50m (\u00a331m), claiming that the cleaners the firm sent to remove the graffiti in December 1997 used highly toxic chemicals and failed to evacuate her from the house, where she was employed to look after Ms Wintour's children. The nanny was found unconscious and taken to hospital, and according to her lawyer, Carl Lustig, she has never recovered. \"She has numbness in her face and hands, multiple neurological problems, vision problems, headaches [and] swelling of the joints,\" Mr Lustig said. He said that Ms Feldt lost her job six months later \"because she was not capable of performing her duties\", and was now in a low-paid \"cashier-like\" job. A Cond\u00e9 Nast spokesman refused to comment on the suit yesterday. If Ms Feldt, 27, is able to prove her case, she may emerge as the most serious human casualty so far of the bitter guerrilla conflict over use of fur by the fashion industry. Nowhere is the battle fought with more aggression than in New York, where women wearing furs have frequently been attacked and splattered with paint by anti-fur groups such as the Paint Panthers. Furs virtually disappeared from the fashion scene in the 80s and early 90s, but in recent years they have staged something of a comeback. The industry lobby, the Fur Information Council, claims that 200 designers used animal fur in their collections this season, compared with 45 in 1985. Vogue and the London-born Ms Wintour have been at the vanguard of fur's rehabilitation. As one of the arbiter's of style, she has been unapologetic about her meat-eating lifestyle. An animal rights militant once flung a dead racoon at her, but she succeeded in turning the incident into yet another publicity coup for the magazine, which she had edited since 1988. On another occasion she sent plates of rare beef to protesters outside Cond\u00e9 Nast's offices. On December 2 1997 the Paint Panthers spray-painted a trail of red paw-prints leading to her house, ending in a pool of animal \"blood\" on the doorstep. According to the case filed by Ms Feldt's lawyer, Ms Wintour asked Cond\u00e9 Nast to remove the paint, and it sent a team of cleaners. Ms Feldt was in the house at the time and was not told to leave, the case says. The fumes found their way into the house, apparently through the drains, and inflicted \"a serious and severe shock to her brain and to her nervous system\". Celebrity and animal rights collided in another Manhattan court room on Tuesday, when Chrissie Hynde, the lead singer of the Pretenders, answered charges for taking part in an attack on a leather clothing display at a New York branch of Gap. Ms Hynde said the leather had come from cows which had been mistreated. The charges were dismissed.",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Loog Oldham, former manager of the Rolling Stones, is one of the most committed self-publicists the rock'n'roll business has ever seen, but even he couldn't describe himself better than Nik Cohn did in his book Awopbopaloobop Alopbambom. \"Oldham, without doubt, was the most flash personality that British pop has ever had, the most anarchic and obsessive and imaginative hustler of all,\" Cohn wrote. \"He loathed slowness and drabness, age and caution and incompetence, mediocrity of all kinds, and he could not stand to work his way up steadily like anyone else. Instead, he barnstormed, he came on quite outrageous. I think his talent and impact have been very, very underestimated.\" </p> <p>Oldham quotes this admiring passage in his new autobiography, Stoned. How could he have resisted? The book arrives as Oldham is attempting a mini-renaissance, after alcohol and fast living dragged him close to the brink in the mid-90s. It is a speedy, quick-witted read - and part of its intrigue lies in trying to decide whether Oldham was really as significant as he thinks he was. </p> <p>He only takes the story as far as 1964, by which time he had led the Rolling Stones up the British charts and was beginning to eye up the vast potential of the US. Although those expecting epic yarns of rock'n'roll debauchery will have to wait for the projected sequel (which will also cover Oldham's years running his pioneering indie label, Immediate), the story he tells is fascinating. Andrew Oldham is at its centre, but equally it is a portrait of British society in transition: a drab, grey nation suddenly whisked up in the swirling cloud of the 60s. </p> <p>\"England was never shitty,\" argues Oldham, who now lives in Colombia. \"It was what you made of it, and my book acknowledges and gives thanks to that.\" </p> <p>Oldham was brought up by his Australian-Jewish mother Celia in London, and learned a curiously English mixture of arrogance, rebelliousness, gender confusion and good manners at Wellingborough public school. \"In the late 50s, my school would put on Gilbert &amp; Sullivan romps such as HMS Pinafore, in which young men dressed as young girls and looked very pretty,\" he remembers. \"This could be very confusing to a 13-year-old boy.\" These notions of role-playing would later emerge in the camp androgyny exploited by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. The idea of the Stones as Oldham's identity-by-proxy was central to the way he handled their career, from the way they dressed onstage to their sound in the studio, where Oldham directed the recording sessions like a mad maestro hearing apocalyptic sounds in his head. </p> <p>It sounds comical now, but what triggered Oldham's lust for the pop business was the stage musical, and later the movie, of Expresso Bongo. He was mesmerised by the show's fictional pop manager, Johnnie Jackson. \"This was the first ever British dramatisation of the 50s rock'n'roll scene and the revolution in the streets it was fomenting,\" Oldham writes in Stoned. \"It signalled a coming of age for the new music, the new style, the new hustle.\" </p> <p>And Oldham intuitively grasped what he needed to steal to create his distinctive personal style. \"I felt like a thoughtful French New Wave movie,\" he writes, \"so I rolled the credits and appeared on location in Hampstead Village's thriving beatnik scene.\" </p> <p>Later, he gravitated to Chelsea, where he turned up at Mary Quant's Kings Road boutique, Bazaar, and talked himself into a job. \"At first fashion was the fashion, then fashion became music,\" he explains. His moment of epiphany came in 1963 when he saw his first Rolling Stones gig at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond. Since clothes loom even larger in Oldham's narcissistic recollections than the pop stars he circulated among, he had made sure he was dressed for the part: \"broadcloth, blue, tab-collared shirt, jet-black wool tie, three-piece suit complete with cuffs on jacket and trousers, flair-waisted jacket \u00e0 la Bunny Roger with inverted vent, spit and polished side-laced black booties\". </p> <p>As the pop potentate he must have been insufferable, not least when he was swanning around town in his blue Chevrolet Impala, driven by his rent-a-thug Reg \"the Butcher\" King. Former Decca promotion man Tony Hall catches Oldham in a nutshell with his observation that he \"looked like a white English equivalent to a Blue Note record sleeve\". </p> <p>Oldham's arch, self-mythologising tone would grate on the reader a lot sooner than it does, were it not for the inclusion of such comments from a broad cross-section of eye-witnesses. Vidal Sassoon, Pete Townshend, Gene Pitney, Lionel Bart, Mary Quant, Marianne Faithfull and future Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones all lob in their half-a-crown's worth, along with a swarm of friends, publicists and journalists. </p> <p>The book's overriding impression is of the unbearable excitement of British pop's first brilliant dawn, when you could meet everybody who mattered in the Green Room on a Friday evening at the TV pop show Ready Steady Go! The knowledge that it was a fleeting moment, with many of the protagonists doomed to an early exit, merely intensifies the buzz. </p> <p>If Oldham were entering the music industry afresh today, how would he do it? \"With a hit song, a follow-up and a law degree,\" he spiels. \"But if I was starting out with a lead singer who put me at one with the world and a guitarist who was at one with the world, I'd still jump into a swimming pool with no water. Stoned is not a cautionary tale - it's a celebration and carries the hope that any self-respecting impassioned young 19-year-old of today would do the same.\" </p> <p>Stoned is published by Secker &amp; Warburg, price \u00a316.99. The Immediate Singles Collection will be released by Sequel Records next month.</p> <p><strong>'They liked my ignorance'</strong></p> <p>Gered Mankowitz is as integral to the 60s as dolly birds and Purple Hearts. As a 16-year-old in 1963 he had his own studio in the heart of the most swinging of London scenes - Mason's Yard, SW1, over the road from the Scotch of St James nightclub and next to the Indica art gallery, where John met Yoko. By the age of 17 he was shooting Marianne Faithfull for her mercurial manager, Andrew Loog Oldham. A year later Oldham commissioned Mankowitz to photograph what became the album cover for the Rolling Stones' Out of Our Heads, and to take their American visa photographs while he was at it. For the next three years Mankowitz's images of the band were to be burned onto the public's retina: Brian Jones as a Prince Regent gone to seed, Mick Jagger as the naughty boy bourgeois-in-waiting, Charlie Watts as an unruffled smoothie, Bill Wyman as a dirty old man and Keith Richards as an innocent waiting to be corrupted. </p> <p>\"I was terrible at school,\" says Mankowitz of his precocious success, \"but I showed an interest in photography. My dad, Wolf Mankowitz, was famous in the 50s and 60s as a writer and a personality, so as a family we had been photographed quite a lot, in particular by a wonderful man called Tom Blau who owned the photo agency Camera Press. He liked my work and offered me an apprenticeship, so I was out of school at 15 and into a sweatshop, where I learned everything. Eventually Tom sent me to the zoo to shoot Guy the Gorilla. In 1964 I shot the singers Chad and Jeremy, who were appearing on a television show with Marianne Faithfull; Marianne was having a hit with As Tears Go By so everyone was talking about her. We all went out to dinner that night. I thought she was wonderful, started photographing her, and then Oldham asked me if I could photograph the Stones. That's pretty much it.\" </p> <p>Soon after Mankowitz first shot the band, Oldham asked him to join them on their US tour in 1965. \"It was a dream come true for me, and it was a novelty for them to work with a photographer who was younger than they were - Bailey, who had worked with them previously, was well into his 20s and heading into middle age, even then. They liked my ignorance, and felt that I had caught whatever it was that they wanted to be seen at that time. Also, because of being used to famous people at home I wasn't intimidated - as a boy I had been shouted at by Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester to turn my music down. I was playing Stay by Morris Williams and the Zodiacs and they didn't go for it.\" </p> <p>In the American photographs, the band have an innocence not yet eclipsed by an excess of indulgence and success. \"They just had a naughty aspect back then. Mick wiggled his bum and Brian Jones wore check trousers and people were shocked. And they didn't perform; unlike the Beatles they had nothing to do with the all-round entertainer tradition. But by not performing, we created a performance - that sullen, unsmiling, irregularly dressed gang was a new look. It was a great image made from what was within the band themselves.\" </p> <p>All of the Stones looked eccentric; Brian Jones looked downright weird. \"He was a very odd chap, and certainly the standout one in the early days. He had this extraordinary hair on a big head, small neck, wide shoulders, no hips, Rupert the Bear trousers, rollneck sweaters - a look that was quite unique.\" In Mankowitz's photographs, Jones seems alienated from the rest of the band. \"He was capable of fantastic charm, then his dark side would emerge. He was the first to experiment with acid, and it was beginning to have an effect. In Miami he said to me, 'I've got two tabs of acid - have one with me.' I said thank you but no, and he said, 'OK, I'll take both of them and you write down everything I say.' 'No thanks, Brian.' \" </p> <p>In Chicago Jones jumped out of the limo in a traffic jam and disappeared for four days; in Texas he sulked in the car while the others ate burgers in a diner, waiting until they returned to the car to go to the restaurant himself. \"Oldham sent the record plugger in to get him, and he grabbed Brian with hamburger in mouth and threw him into the car,\" remembers Mankowitz. </p> <p>Mankowitz's most celebrated shoot was taken on an icy morning on London's Primrose Hill in November 1966, and became the album cover for Between the Buttons. \"We had been working all night, and the look of the band was fantastic - baggy and craggy. I had this idea of distorting the image by making a home-made filter out of black card, glass and vaseline to make the boys dissolve into the landscape. Brian was lurking in his collar; I was frustrated because it felt like we were on the verge of something really special, and he was messing it up. Andrew said to me, 'Don't worry about Brian.' And he was absolutely right - the way that Brian appeared not to give a shit is exactly what the band was about.\" </p> <p>Between the Buttons marked a high point of Mankowitz's relationship with the band; it soon went downhill. Unwilling to move with the Stones into a new area of experimentation, he was usurped by Michael Cooper, and by mid-'67 the innocence was gone. Brian Jones was lost, Jagger and Richards had been charged with drug offences, and the band fell out with Oldham. Mankowitz went with him. He's still doing portraiture today, having shot everyone from Jimi Hendrix and the Small Faces to the Verve and Oasis for Mojo magazine, but it's the Rolling Stones whose image he really captured and, to an extent, created. \"It was the peak of their initial success and it was a great adventure,\" he says now. \"We were amazed when it went on for another year. Nobody thought it would go on for 35 years.\"</p> <p> Gered Mankowitz's exhibition, The 60s + One, is at Focus Gallery, London WC1 (020-7242 7191), till June 17.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Civil war waged around Jo Thompson. Bands of lawless soldiers passed through the outskirts of her research project, wiping out the mission station and leaving behind a trail of destruction. Thompson was the only white woman in a 23,908km area of the Congo. She was working alone, studying the rainforest and its inhabitants, and she did not want to leave. But when the bush pilot service she used to travel to Kinshasa was grounded and she got word that rebel activity was hotting up, she knew she had no choice but to go. The only way to escape was to get aboard the last powerboat willing to make the gruelling seven-day journey down the Congo River. \"After weeks of mental and emotional conflict, I chose to be on it. But I was already planning my return.\"</p> <p>Primatology is essentially about the discovery of how ape-like we are, or how human-like animals are - and it is the only area of science in which women outnumber men. But while the theories and methods of women primatologists like Thompson have grown to dominate the discipline, it took a man to set this agenda. Louis Leakey was a maverick palaeoanthropologist, a scientific outsider of radical ideas who decided the best way to breathe life into the fossils of the early ape-men he'd dug up was to make a behavioural study of contemporary apes.</p> <p>He believed a woman would be best suited to living with them because he felt women were innately fluent in non-verbal communication (a mother will intuitively know what her infant wants), while men were tongue-tied. Women have evolved to understand the intentions of others, even if no words are spoken, and it is the desire for this intimacy, rather than for academic success, that seems to motivate women primatologists.</p> <p>In 1957, Jane Goodall, a secretary from Bournemouth, introduced herself to Leakey while visiting Kenya. An adventurer and an animal lover, Goodall was also 23 and beautiful. Leakey was a womaniser; on the spot, he offered her a job as his assistant. Three years later, he had raised enough financial support to set her up in Gombe, a stretch of forested hills by Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania, to study the chimpanzees there.</p> <p>No one had ever tried to habituate a colony of wild chimps before and it was believed to be impossible - a view that, in her first few weeks, Goodall began to share. The chimps were hostile, charging at her screaming and breaking big branches. And when they weren't threatening her, they were silently disappearing into the trees.</p> <p>But when Goodall had been at Gombe for three months, an amazing thing happened. She saw a chimp do something no one had ever seen before, something that would change our appreciation of evolution for ever. She saw a chimp she'd called David Greybeard pick a long stem of grass, peel off its leaves and insert it into a termite hole; when the angry termites bit it, he pulled it out and ate them.</p> <p>This sent shock waves through the scientific establishment for two reasons: until that point, the human lineage had been thought the only tool-using ape - and the discovery had been made by a woman and \"amateur\". Leakey was thrilled and organised the National Geographic to film her work. Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees (1965), narrated by Orson Welles, was the first documentary of its kind; it made Goodall a star and effectively gave birth to the women-dominated science of primatology.</p> <p>Leakey set about finding more women to study apes - Dian Fossey for gorillas and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas for Asian orang-utans. National Geographic filmed these women at work, too, playing shamelessly on the image of \"lone women at one with nature\". But there was a troubling side to their existence that was not shown in the films. Civil war and poachers threatened their lives; malaria, snakes and scorpions were a common hazard; they faced searing heat by day, freezing nights and relentless parasites that burrowed in through their skin.</p> <p>Only pure love could keep these women there and, isolated with the apes, they turned to them as a romantic thread. For Fossey, estranged from her own relatives, it was easy to idealise the gorillas and make them family. Friends in the US would be rewarded with the first stool of a new-born gorilla, carefully gift-wrapped.</p> <p>Such intimacy with the apes has brought criticisms of subjectivity and anthropomorphism - a scientific sin. Jane Goodall said of David Greybeard that she grew to love him more than any other chimp she'd ever known, while fellow primatologist Janis Carter so loved Lucy - an American-born captive chimp who had been taught to \"speak\" in sign language, to eat burgers and to drink gin - that she rescued her and took her \"home\" to Africa.</p> <p>For seven years, Carter lived with Lucy in a forest and tried to teach her how to behave as a wild chimp is meant to. This experience affected Carter deeply; she withdrew from humans altogether and moved, grunted and ate as an ape would. The boyfriend she had left in America would sporadically visit, but each time he found her more ape-like. Only after an attack by a male chimp did she return to civilisation.</p> <p>This closeness between women and apes can have a more dangerous downside. Male orang-utans have raped women working at Birut\u00e9 Galdikas' research site in Borneo and at Gombe, primatologist Barbara Smuts has found similarities between the sexually aggressive behaviour of male apes and men.

      "bodyText": "Civil war waged around Jo Thompson. Bands of lawless soldiers passed through the outskirts of her research project, wiping out the mission station and leaving behind a trail of destruction. Thompson was the only white woman in a 23,908km area of the Congo. She was working alone, studying the rainforest and its inhabitants, and she did not want to leave. But when the bush pilot service she used to travel to Kinshasa was grounded and she got word that rebel activity was hotting up, she knew she had no choice but to go. The only way to escape was to get aboard the last powerboat willing to make the gruelling seven-day journey down the Congo River. \"After weeks of mental and emotional conflict, I chose to be on it. But I was already planning my return.\" Primatology is essentially about the discovery of how ape-like we are, or how human-like animals are - and it is the only area of science in which women outnumber men. But while the theories and methods of women primatologists like Thompson have grown to dominate the discipline, it took a man to set this agenda. Louis Leakey was a maverick palaeoanthropologist, a scientific outsider of radical ideas who decided the best way to breathe life into the fossils of the early ape-men he'd dug up was to make a behavioural study of contemporary apes. He believed a woman would be best suited to living with them because he felt women were innately fluent in non-verbal communication (a mother will intuitively know what her infant wants), while men were tongue-tied. Women have evolved to understand the intentions of others, even if no words are spoken, and it is the desire for this intimacy, rather than for academic success, that seems to motivate women primatologists. In 1957, Jane Goodall, a secretary from Bournemouth, introduced herself to Leakey while visiting Kenya. An adventurer and an animal lover, Goodall was also 23 and beautiful. Leakey was a womaniser; on the spot, he offered her a job as his assistant. Three years later, he had raised enough financial support to set her up in Gombe, a stretch of forested hills by Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania, to study the chimpanzees there. No one had ever tried to habituate a colony of wild chimps before and it was believed to be impossible - a view that, in her first few weeks, Goodall began to share. The chimps were hostile, charging at her screaming and breaking big branches. And when they weren't threatening her, they were silently disappearing into the trees. But when Goodall had been at Gombe for three months, an amazing thing happened. She saw a chimp do something no one had ever seen before, something that would change our appreciation of evolution for ever. She saw a chimp she'd called David Greybeard pick a long stem of grass, peel off its leaves and insert it into a termite hole; when the angry termites bit it, he pulled it out and ate them. This sent shock waves through the scientific establishment for two reasons: until that point, the human lineage had been thought the only tool-using ape - and the discovery had been made by a woman and \"amateur\". Leakey was thrilled and organised the National Geographic to film her work. Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees (1965), narrated by Orson Welles, was the first documentary of its kind; it made Goodall a star and effectively gave birth to the women-dominated science of primatology. Leakey set about finding more women to study apes - Dian Fossey for gorillas and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas for Asian orang-utans. National Geographic filmed these women at work, too, playing shamelessly on the image of \"lone women at one with nature\". But there was a troubling side to their existence that was not shown in the films. Civil war and poachers threatened their lives; malaria, snakes and scorpions were a common hazard; they faced searing heat by day, freezing nights and relentless parasites that burrowed in through their skin. Only pure love could keep these women there and, isolated with the apes, they turned to them as a romantic thread. For Fossey, estranged from her own relatives, it was easy to idealise the gorillas and make them family. Friends in the US would be rewarded with the first stool of a new-born gorilla, carefully gift-wrapped. Such intimacy with the apes has brought criticisms of subjectivity and anthropomorphism - a scientific sin. Jane Goodall said of David Greybeard that she grew to love him more than any other chimp she'd ever known, while fellow primatologist Janis Carter so loved Lucy - an American-born captive chimp who had been taught to \"speak\" in sign language, to eat burgers and to drink gin - that she rescued her and took her \"home\" to Africa. For seven years, Carter lived with Lucy in a forest and tried to teach her how to behave as a wild chimp is meant to. This experience affected Carter deeply; she withdrew from humans altogether and moved, grunted and ate as an ape would. The boyfriend she had left in America would sporadically visit, but each time he found her more ape-like. Only after an attack by a male chimp did she return to civilisation. This closeness between women and apes can have a more dangerous downside. Male orang-utans have raped women working at Birut\u00e9 Galdikas' research site in Borneo and at Gombe, primatologist Barbara Smuts has found similarities between the sexually aggressive behaviour of male apes and men. Smuts (a fan of Goodall's whose research was cut short when she was kidnapped by Congolese rebels) noticed that female chimps were beaten by males when they were not sexually receptive; later, when the female became receptive, she would mate with her aggressor rather than risk another beating. Smuts reasoned it was in the female's interest to mate with a strong male, just as, through history, women have aligned themselves with powerful men who could protect and provide for them and their children. Similarly, sitting near a 400lb silver-back gorilla and gaining this powerful creature's acceptance may give women primatologists a dangerous frisson. While female primates were almost ignored by men, they have proved fascinating to women, who have discovered not only that many species are matriarchal but that a modern woman's concerns have grown with her in evolutionary terms. Primatologist Jeanne Altmann was fascinated by the way nursing baboons manage their time, instinctively weighing up the costs and benefits of each task and therefore how much time to dedicate to it: how much to suckle the baby, how much to forage for food, how much to groom powerful friends or be groomed, how much to search for a good sleeping site. Just as human mothers are presented with a clash of interests, so are primate mothers. There are other links, too: women primatologists find their periods adjust from 28 days to apes' 32-day cycle. Amy Parish, who experiences this while studying bonobos, theorises that menstrual synchronicity between apes means they are reproductively equal, so no female will be especially sexy at any one time, leaving the others feeling jealous and excluded, and no one female will bear the brunt of male sexual interest alone. The female orgasm is a phenomenon women also share with their primate sisters and its evolution has been theorised on by primatologist Sarah Hrdy. Male primates often show hostility towards infants that are not their own and Hrdy concluded that female sexual pleasure evolved to motivate females into taking a series of male partners, thus confusing paternity. That way, when an infant is born, at best a series of males should provide for it, as it could be theirs; at worst the males shouldn't kill it, again because it could be theirs. For bonobos, both sexual pleasure and bonding come through lesbianism: females have pronounced clitorises and rub their genitals together to elicit mutual orgasms. There is no violent sexual coercion in the lives of female bonobos because sisterhood protects them; no male, no matter how powerful, can play off one female against another the way male chimps and men sometimes do. Paradoxically, while uncovering the essence of womanhood and female bonding, women primatologists have become jealous of each other's successes; they have competed at conferences and even gone so far as to murder another's favourite ape. They are an obsessed, passionate, brave and individualistic breed, and the influence they have had on our self-perception is immense.

Mr Prescott will today open the summit delayed since February because the government has nothing positive to say about rail. Last year he managed to lean on the prime minister to suggest that transport had not slipped down the government's agenda when it clearly had.

Since last year, the industry can boast of little cheer, except that the public, forced to use what should be an efficient alternative means of transport, is flocking to rail. In the past four years, passenger usage has soared by more than 25%, better than at any time since the second world war.</p> <p>The industry's most striking deficiency is a dearth of investment. The government has been locked into the legacy it inherited from the Tories, a series of seven to 15-year-long franchises, underpinned by gradually diminishing subsidies from the taxpayer, some of it going into the pockets of the train operating companies. It could and should have made sure that the subsidies were being injected directly into the industry. And it could have found ways of making Railtrack improve the infrastructure, but it has not. Belatedly, the rail regulator has started to exert his authority, after his predecessor sat on his hands for five years.</p> <p>Instead, the government has looked to the privatised monopoly to see through important capital projects, such as the building of the Channel tunnel rail link. The first stage of the link is ahead of schedule, but Railtrack still has to reach a decision on the more expensive stage into central London, guaranteed by Mr Prescott if the Railtrack deal collapses.</p> <p>The west coast mainline project between London and Glasgow is in a mess. Railtrack has bungled the scheme, allowing its costs to burgeon out of control from \u00a32bn two years ago to more than \u00a35bn, putting at risk the timing of Richard Branson's adventurous scheme to introduce 140mph tilting trains on the potentially lucrative London to Manchester route. Railtrack is bristling at persistent inquiries from the rail regulator, who understandably wants to know what is going on, while the company is openly pleading with the deputy prime minister for more money.</p> <p>But there has been very little, a dribble, actually spent on the railway, apart from the London Underground, which is in constant need of cash transfusions. As the election approaches, Mr Prescott is becoming a very worried man. Clearly there could be more money available for transport. But that is a matter primarily for the chancellor, not Mr Prescott, and Mr Brown is not due to reach a final decision until the end of July. In the meantime, Mr Prescott has been promising the earth to Sir Alastair Morton, the former boss of Eurotunnel and chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), who has the responsibility to distribute the cash on behalf of the government.</p> <p>Nothing is mentioned officially but Mr Prescott has indicated to Sir Alastair that he could have at least \u00a32bn for the railway if he could show immediate results which would win the government bonus points before the election. The problem is that Sir Alastair can't, even if Mr Prescott can squeeze the money out of Mr Brown's wallet. What Mr Prescott wants should have happened long ago, but successive governments have been too mean.</p> <p>Caught in the midst of the political infighting, the travelling public is exasperated and defenceless. It does not believe what it is told: that the railway is getting better. Official figures can be made to prove anything. The truth is that punctuality and reliability has hardly improved in the past year, some services have been quietly withdrawn, and overcrowding on some routes is an outrage. The fares structure is long overdue for reform. It remains unnecessarily complicated, and the window of opportunity for cheaper travel at off-peak times keeps closing.</p> <p>The one body which might bring some influence to bear on this sad state of affairs, the SRA, is a disappointment. Far from producing a bright new panacea for the industry, and trying to make the railway more comfortable and responsive to the needs of passengers, it has largely immersed itself in a frantic search for new franchise operators. The SRA's attention is almost solely concentrated on rolling out three new rail franchises. But will they be more passenger friendly than the first lot, desperately hammered out in the last months of John Major's government?</p> <p>It would be far more appropriate if the SRA was commanded by a full-time chairman, not the part-timer, Sir Alastair Morton, handpicked by Mr Prescott. Sir Alastair is energetic, sharp, and works longer than his official hours permit, but the extra work load carried by the SRA demands greater concentration in an industry which has been failing for too long.</p> <p>Today's participants have been instructed by Mr Prescott to sing from the same hymn sheet.

We are, in fact, fascinated by the whole deal, as obsessed, intrigued and pleasantly appalled by them on the occasion of their split, as we were throughout the latter, most public stages of their relationship. (To be entirely truthful, the break up isn't proving as messy or emotionally bloody as we may have wished - no public screaming matches, no undignified splurgings to the press, no evidence of heavy objects being thrown. Then again, these are early days and with the whiff of infidelity hanging round Liz like something rather pungent, chances are it'll all kick off nicely within a fortnight.) </p> <p>But while speculation about the catalyst behind the split runs riot, another issue is raising its head. Can Liz's celebrity survive without Hugh, and will Hugh find anything sparkly enough to detract from his wholly pedestrian wardrobe without Liz? Will we ever hear from either again? </p> <p>For the past six years or so, Liz and Hugh have defined contemporary supercoupledom. Theirs was a sparkly union, launched publicly in the midst of a premiere with the aid of an outr\u00e9 Versace dress, rocked and yet curiously, \"cemented\" with a glorious, sleazy, sexy scandal, and trimmed with all sorts of pretty aristos, bizarre diet regimes, and extravagant rumours about their sexual proclivities. Posh and Becks might be more famous, Zoe and Norman might be more Ibiza, but Liz and Hugh were \"Hollywood\" in the way that proper power couples should be. They were our Tom and Nicole, with the added bonus of being British and thus more accessible. But more than this, before we acknowledged them as a double act, they were nothing. Before Liz, Hugh was an arguably attractive, essentially inoffensive posho actor. Before Hugh, Liz was - well, who knew? That they were so truly trifling separately, and yet so utterly, instantly mesmerising together, lies at the heart of their significance as a supercouple. </p> <p>Never before has the notion of the supercouple held such currency. It's hardly a new concept (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, I am led to believe, had a certain claim on public interest levels in their day), yet it's growing increasingly relevant with every passing moment of the 21st century. In an age when celebrity obsession rages unchecked, the idea that two famous people could cop off, date, and even set up home together titillates us beyond belief. What do they talk about? What do they do ? How can they bare the giddiness of so much specialness in one place at one time? It's hard to imagine how they keep from exploding. </p> <p>What is it about the pairing off of two celebrities that earns them infinite cachet? What is it about taking up with another member of the fame pack which not only compounds and confirms your fame, but multiplies it infinitely? Why are these individuals so much greater as a double act than the sum of their parts would suggest? </p> <p>Take the Beckhams. Independently, she was a scowling, talentless harridan who claimed she was posh when she obviously wasn't, and who flaunted her recently acquired wealth in a terribly gaudy manner. Without her, he flashed thigh prettily enough on the edges of our consciousness, but was basically one of a number of dull enough footballers and it was very difficult to distinguish between them. Sometimes it was difficult to care. But together, they make a truly majestic package. With him, Tor transformed into a delightful, smiling, chatty thing with a lovely sense of humour (she was sending up her own social pretensions all along - now we see) and an open delight in her newly confirmed celebrity. With her, Beckham got himself highlights and a look that shot him straight into cultural icon territory, not to mention an entr\u00e9e onto the front pages of every newspaper. Oh, the foul football chants in her honour, oh, the surreptitious winks she shot into the VIP area after performing a solo in yet another packed out arena, oh, the leaked phone calls, the retrieved shopping lists (pickled onions and cakes! Imagine!), the extravagant gifts. They were just like us, only much, much better! </p> <p>The phenomenon of the contemporary supercouple is, surprisingly, not that rigidly defined. Strictly speaking, it should involve two people of equally matched celebrity. One should be blonde, the other brunette. They should be, if not equally pretty, then matched in other respects. Intelligence, for example, can compensate for looks. Their wardrobes should work well together. They should have a slightly different claim on sections of the press, so that they might spread news of their fame to those who were formerly ignorant of their existence. They should spend their entire lives whirling about socially, attending charity launches, endorsing the right appeals, going to the right weddings. They should be sparkly, smiley, smug, and ever so slightly aloof. Think AA Gill and Nicola Formby. </p> <p>But, as the past five years have proved, supercoupledom is actually very much open to interpretation. Zoe Ball and Norman Cook, for example, were an odd combo on the face of things. She was so terribly Radio One, he was so achingly edgy. She was so blonde, he was so balding. Their celebrity seemed so at odds, so awkward. Yet the combination works. </p> <p>Then consider Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit. Initially, Liam's fascination with the obvious, uppity blonde seemed to damage his fame stock, detract from his status. What did he see in her? We thought he was more fashionable than that . But, in the fullness of time, we watched her reinvent herself as an accomplished rock vixen, redress the balance, provide a more than adequate foil to his wild, reckless vulnerability. The Beckhams should equally, strictly speaking, cancel each other's celebrity out by being so unapologetically normal together, by revelling in their combined ordinariness, by allowing us sporadic chinks of insight into a lifestyle crammed with Indian takeaway-splattered tracksuits and Blind Date. </p> <p>Yet that just enchants us more. </p> <p>The basic appeal of the accomplished supercouple can be reduced to this: by hooking up with another, carefully selected celeb, you can eliminate your bad points, compensate for your own shortcomings, and hint at a softer, more vulnerable side. Attach yourself to someone smarter, prettier, more fashionable, hipper, funnier than you are, and you will automatically acquire these missing qualities by osmosis. They, equally, will benefit from your particular brand of star quality. Your public perception will become more complete, more exciting. Together, you are quite literally, the ultimate individual. </p> <p>None of which will help Liz or Hugh right now. At this moment, it's a little too easy to picture Liz, swathed in mink in some cosy corner of Sudeley Castle, scanning the small print of her Est\u00e9e Lauder contract nervously in case she comes across a \"terminate in case of split from (highly) significant other\" clause. And Hugh, flicking through some casting books for a suitable replacement. Although of course, there's always the possibility that they're both sobbing into the remains of the bottle of Bourbon they set about at 6am, playing all their key relationship CDs over and over, and stroking old photos.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday announced that it is to examine ways of cracking down on the international black market in art and antiquities used by drugs barons to launder cash. Experts estimate that the illicit trade in Britain may be worth up to \u00a3500m a year. Ancient artefacts looted from sites in Africa and the Middle East can be bought and sold legally in the UK, even if they were smuggled out of their country of origin illegally. The age of the pieces and the nature of archaeology means it is often impossible to tell how something was obtained, and that, combined with their high value, makes them ideal for money laundering. Yesterday's move comes after bitter criticism of government inaction by archaeologists and museum professionals, who are outraged at the British refusal - most recently in February - to sign Unesco and other international agreements to bar the trade. The culture minister, Alan Howarth, said the government had been unable to sign after receiving legal advice that the protocols were in conflict with British property law. He added that this decision might be reconsidered by an expert panel, announced yesterday, which is to report by November. Mr Howarth insisted he was \"very unhappy\" at the present situation, where it is legal for anyone to set up in Britain without a licence as an antiquities dealer and to sell objects which might have been illegally excavated, or stolen, and smuggled out of their native countries. The trade ranges from massive temple carvings from Khmer temples in Cambodia, hacked off to order or stolen from stores, through frescoes and mosaics chiselled off walls in Europe, African bronzes, prehistoric carved stones from Britain and Ireland, down to millions of small archaeological objects, including Greek gold rings, Egyptian mummy jewellery, Phoenician coins, and humble domestic objects such as pottery oil lamps. They are sold with minimal provenance or none at all, by galleries and specialist dealers, and are virtually untraceable. A report being prepared for the Museums Association and the International Conference of Museums covers recent police raids in Germany, which uncovered 60 crates of icons, frescoes and mosaics ripped from churches in northern Cyprus, and a raid two years ago on a villa in Sicily which held 30,000 Phoenician, Greek and Roman pieces, worth over \u00a320m. A House of Commons select committee is also investigating the trade, and has heard reports suggesting the British market could be worth up to \u00a3500m a year, and that international police forces are increasingly concerned at the involvement of drug cartels in the trade, both directly selling stolen antiquities and laundering money through the trade. Yesterday Mr Howarth announced the setting up of an advisory panel of experts, both to investigate the extent of the British problem, and to advise the government on how to tackle it. \"I am very uncomfortable about the situation in which there is freedom to trade in objects which have been illegally exported or indeed stolen,\" he said. \"I am intensely concerned that scandalous things may be happening.\"",

What the veteran Mr Winnick - \"the stupidest man in the House\" as Harold Wilson once called him at the dispatch box - really said was: \"Is it not good news that the murderous leader of the rebels in Sri Lanka has been captured. . .\" Why, you may wonder, did Mr Tony reply without correcting Mr Winnick? Because it was a planted question, and he wasn't listening. Had Mr Winnick asked \"Will my Rt Hon friend confirm that he favours Anusol for his piles, and finds the preparation efficacious?\" the reply would still have begun: \"We can be very, very proud of our armed forces . . .\" As to the morality of Hansard rewriting Mr Winnick to make Mr T look less daft, some may think this a rather more serious distortion than translating Prescott into English.</p> <p>\u0095 So many years have elapsed since Harold Wilson made his remark that it is in sore need of review. In the weeks ahead we will be assessing some of the Commons's leading thickies with a view to announcing the Stupidest Person in the House 2000 award in July. A successful defence by Mr Winnick cannot be ruled out, although many people's idea of ante-post favourite will be my old friend Sir Archie Hamilton, the former Tory 1922 committee chairman who last year ducked out of a linguistics challenge against a talking chimp.</p> <p>\u0095 As so often when a household name departs the planet, Michael Winner has personal memories. \"John was a very close friend,\" says Michael, who directed him twice, \"the perfect gent and very witty.\" By way of illustrating these qualities there is an anecdote . . . one of how, while shooting the 1988 film noir classic Appointment with Death, he persuaded his then girlfriend Jenny Seagrove to streak through a corridor at the Hotel King David in Jerusalem - and informed of this frolicsome hilarity, Gielgud replied: \"Good for her - I thought she was such a timid girl.\" Aching sides, aching sides. But Michael, do you think you taught him much? \"Not at all.\" What, no tips or guidance at all? \"He was the easiest in the world to work with, a wonderful professional.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Out of the blue a demand arrives from the Inland Revenue. \"Balance of account at 16 May 00,\" reads the bottom line, \"0.01\". After a large brandy, I ring the Hammersmith tax office to discuss if I can pay it in instalments. It's the computer, says a nice woman. \"You'd think in this day and age it would be able to distinguish between amounts, but it can't.\" The thing that's really bothering me, I say, is the fact that daily interest is charged on late payments. In a couple of years it might be 2p. \"Let me check for you,\" says the woman concernedly. She disappears for two or three minutes and returns with good news. \"You can just ignore it,\" she says. \"It will be carried over to the July payment, and you won't be charged any interest.\" Well, thanks for setting my mind at rest. Who said these tax people had no heart?</p> <p>\u0095 Concern grows that the Daily Telegraph is mounting a challenge the Guardian's dominance in the broadsheet segment of the yoof market. For the second time in a few weeks, a headline on the leader page has been a reference to a pop single. Following a play on the Pretenders' chorus \"It is time for you to stop all of your sobbing,\" yesterday's leader about the flower show read: \"Why we want to go to Chelsea.\" Regardless of Charles Moore's obsession with appearing cool, Elvis Costello and Ray Davies didn't write lyrics with a view to future adaptation in the Telegraph comment section. Poor show.</p>",

Had Mr Winnick asked \"Will my Rt Hon friend confirm that he favours Anusol for his piles, and finds the preparation efficacious?\" the reply would still have begun: \"We can be very, very proud of our armed forces . . .\" As to the morality of Hansard rewriting Mr Winnick to make Mr T look less daft, some may think this a rather more serious distortion than translating Prescott into English. \u0095 So many years have elapsed since Harold Wilson made his remark that it is in sore need of review. In the weeks ahead we will be assessing some of the Commons's leading thickies with a view to announcing the Stupidest Person in the House 2000 award in July. A successful defence by Mr Winnick cannot be ruled out, although many people's idea of ante-post favourite will be my old friend Sir Archie Hamilton, the former Tory 1922 committee chairman who last year ducked out of a linguistics challenge against a talking chimp. \u0095 As so often when a household name departs the planet, Michael Winner has personal memories. \"John was a very close friend,\" says Michael, who directed him twice, \"the perfect gent and very witty.\" By way of illustrating these qualities there is an anecdote . . . one of how, while shooting the 1988 film noir classic Appointment with Death, he persuaded his then girlfriend Jenny Seagrove to streak through a corridor at the Hotel King David in Jerusalem - and informed of this frolicsome hilarity, Gielgud replied: \"Good for her - I thought she was such a timid girl.\" Aching sides, aching sides. But Michael, do you think you taught him much? \"Not at all.\" What, no tips or guidance at all? \"He was the easiest in the world to work with, a wonderful professional.\" \u0095 Out of the blue a demand arrives from the Inland Revenue. \"Balance of account at 16 May 00,\" reads the bottom line, \"0.01\". After a large brandy, I ring the Hammersmith tax office to discuss if I can pay it in instalments. It's the computer, says a nice woman. \"You'd think in this day and age it would be able to distinguish between amounts, but it can't.\" The thing that's really bothering me, I say, is the fact that daily interest is charged on late payments. In a couple of years it might be 2p. \"Let me check for you,\" says the woman concernedly. She disappears for two or three minutes and returns with good news. \"You can just ignore it,\" she says. \"It will be carried over to the July payment, and you won't be charged any interest.\" Well, thanks for setting my mind at rest. Who said these tax people had no heart? \u0095 Concern grows that the Daily Telegraph is mounting a challenge the Guardian's dominance in the broadsheet segment of the yoof market. For the second time in a few weeks, a headline on the leader page has been a reference to a pop single. Following a play on the Pretenders' chorus \"It is time for you to stop all of your sobbing,\" yesterday's leader about the flower show read: \"Why we want to go to Chelsea.\" Regardless of Charles Moore's obsession with appearing cool, Elvis Costello and Ray Davies didn't write lyrics with a view to future adaptation in the Telegraph comment section. Poor show.",

      "bodyText": "Russia threatened to launch air strikes on alleged terrorist training bases in Afghanistan yesterday, because of the Taliban movement's support for Chechen separatists. Senior ministers, military leaders and the head of the Kremlin's national security council said they could not exclude the possibility of staging bombing raids on Afghanistan. On Monday Moscow claimed that the Taliban and the world's most infamous terrorist, Osama bin Laden, were training, aiding and supplying Chechen rebel forces. President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, went to the Belarus capital, Minsk, for a meeting of former Soviet republics devoted to \"collective security\" to discuss the potential for basing Russian troops and anti-terrorist forces in the independent states of central Asia. The meeting is the latest evidence of Mr Putin's more robust approach towards exerting Russia's influence on its neighbours and his determination to project Russia as a great power. He asserted Russian leadership of the collective security pact singed in 1992 between Russia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Belarus. The Taliban government in Afghanistan, denied Monday's claim by the Kremlin spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, that it was aiding and abetting the Chechen insurrection. It warned Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan that they would be held responsible for any Russian aggression against Afghanistan. Mr Putin's national security council chairman, Sergei Ivanov, responded yesterday by saying that the six signatories of the security pact had to clarify the legal terms under which Russia would deploy anti-terrorist units in central Asia. He said in Minsk that he did not rule out \"undertaking certain military actions\" if the Taliban movement put pressure on \"Russian allies, particularly Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan\". Leading member of the Russian parliament, from the communist speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, to the young liberal Boris Nemtsov, criticised the government's talk of possible air strikes as irresponsible, particularly given the disastrous history of Russian military engagement in Afghanistan. But the foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, the deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, and the defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, all kept up the war of words. Tough talk in Moscow is becoming a hallmark of the Mr Putin's government. Defence ministry sources told the Interfax news agency that plans to bomb Afghanistan had been drafted and awaited only a political green light. \"If the relevant political decision is taken, the strikes will follow immediately,\" the sources said. \"There are no plans to use ground forces.\" Viktor Kazantsev, the general in charge of the Chechen war campaign whom Mr Putin has just appointed his special envoy in the north Caucasus, welcomed the threat to bomb Afghanistan. Moscow newspapers generally played down the sabre-rattling, regarding it as more political than military and as the latest evidence of Mr Putin's fondness for talking tough. Mr Yastrzhembsky said on Monday that Moscow had proof that the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, was using couriers to maintain contact with Mr Bin Laden; that Islamist guerrillas from Chechnya, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were undergoing training at a base in Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan; and that arms and ammunition were being ferried to Chechen fighters from Afghanistan via Azerbaijan and Georgia.",

      "body": "<p>The Dulwich Picture Gallery, the oldest purpose-built public gallery in England, will be reopened by the Queen today, but she will not see its most important new feature.</p> <p>The state of the art security, built into the \u00a38.3m project, is designed to rescue Dulwich from its least coveted title, custodian of the most stolen picture in the world.</p> <p>The gallery was mortified at being listed in the Guinness Book of Records over the little Rembrandt portrait which has been stolen four times, most recently in the 1980s.</p> <p>The portrait of a tranquil young man, small enough to put in a coat pocket, is now so protected that the director, Desmond Shawe-Taylor, says it would be easier to steal the building around it.</p> <p>The painting was so well known in the international art world that thieves found it impossible to sell. It was recovered once from West Germany, returned anonymously once, found on the back of a bicycle another time, and discovered under a bench in a graveyard in Streatham, south London. Nobody was charged with any of the thefts.</p> <p>The gallery was designed by Sir John Soane and built in 1811. It is unique in including the bodies of the founders: a mausoleum contains tomb chests occupied by the Swiss Sir Francis Bourgeois, the French Noel Desenfans, and his Welsh wife, Margaret. The two men were outstandingly successful art dealers in London, and the three shared a house, provoking much gossip. Margaret's dowry paid for the collection, originally commissioned by Stanislaus Augustus, King of Poland - by the time it was assembled he had been forced to abdicate. There is a fourth empty chest in the mausoleum which Soane had originally intended for himself.</p> <p>The bronze, glass and brick extension by architect Rick Mather, completed with a \u00a35m Heritage lottery grant, provides a new restaurant and offices and education rooms.

      "bodyText": "The Dulwich Picture Gallery, the oldest purpose-built public gallery in England, will be reopened by the Queen today, but she will not see its most important new feature. The state of the art security, built into the \u00a38.3m project, is designed to rescue Dulwich from its least coveted title, custodian of the most stolen picture in the world. The gallery was mortified at being listed in the Guinness Book of Records over the little Rembrandt portrait which has been stolen four times, most recently in the 1980s. The portrait of a tranquil young man, small enough to put in a coat pocket, is now so protected that the director, Desmond Shawe-Taylor, says it would be easier to steal the building around it. The painting was so well known in the international art world that thieves found it impossible to sell. It was recovered once from West Germany, returned anonymously once, found on the back of a bicycle another time, and discovered under a bench in a graveyard in Streatham, south London. Nobody was charged with any of the thefts. The gallery was designed by Sir John Soane and built in 1811. It is unique in including the bodies of the founders: a mausoleum contains tomb chests occupied by the Swiss Sir Francis Bourgeois, the French Noel Desenfans, and his Welsh wife, Margaret. The two men were outstandingly successful art dealers in London, and the three shared a house, provoking much gossip. Margaret's dowry paid for the collection, originally commissioned by Stanislaus Augustus, King of Poland - by the time it was assembled he had been forced to abdicate. There is a fourth empty chest in the mausoleum which Soane had originally intended for himself. The bronze, glass and brick extension by architect Rick Mather, completed with a \u00a35m Heritage lottery grant, provides a new restaurant and offices and education rooms. It partly achieves Soane's original design of the gallery as an academic quadrangle. Rehanging the pictures has brought many works out of store, including a beautiful 17th century Venus and Cupid by Giovanni Battista Paggi, bought 200 years ago and never displayed because it was in such poor condition. A local family sponsored the restoration and chose the picture in memory of a young woman. The Dulwich collection, including outstanding works by Rembrandt, Poussin and Rubens, has been on a world tour while the building was closed. Although comparatively small, the quality is regarded as quite outstanding. The gallery reopens to the public tomorrow. Adult admission will be \u00a34, but Fridays will be free. This week in celebration the gallery will be open till midnight.",

The creatures suddenly appeared off Senegalese coasts in 1986; in 1998, fishermen had landed 2,500 tons of them. Scientists for L'Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD) tagged 6,000, explored the burrows they dug in submarine sand and monitored their diet by counting the bivalves piled up outside their front doors. Females can get to 5kg but die soon aftertending their 200,000 eggs. Males can get to 8kg - but lose weight and die almost at the same time as the females they have fertilised. </p> <p><strong> The answers lie in the soil </strong><br> More bleak news from the International Food Policy Research Institute. Around 40% of the world's agricultural land i s seriously degraded - 75% of centralAmerica's cropland, 11% of Asia's, 20% of Africa's. Researchers studying satellite data blame wind and water erosion, repeated cropping, mechanical tilling and bad water management. This is grim news: there will be another 1.5bn mouths to feed by 2020. Director Per Pinstrup-Andersen says \"Small farmers ought to have access to drought-tolerant seed, insect-resistant seed, pest-resistant seed, the kinds of things small farmers need in order to increase production.\" </p> <p><strong> Spud you can really like </strong><br> Antibiotics work by killing bacteria. Potatoes just discourage them with a polyphenol oxidase. This has given researchers at the Miami University of Ohio, worried about antibiotic resistance, something they can sink their teeth into. \"We found that a water extract of the outer few millimetres of a potato inhibited the attachment of an oral streptococcus to the substance it uses for attachment to the tooth surfaces,\" Marjorie Cowan told the American Society for Microbiology. \"It also prevented the attachment of E.coli which cause urinary tract infections to its host cells.\"</p>",

The creatures suddenly appeared off Senegalese coasts in 1986; in 1998, fishermen had landed 2,500 tons of them. Scientists for L'Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD) tagged 6,000, explored the burrows they dug in submarine sand and monitored their diet by counting the bivalves piled up outside their front doors. Females can get to 5kg but die soon aftertending their 200,000 eggs. Males can get to 8kg - but lose weight and die almost at the same time as the females they have fertilised. The answers lie in the soil More bleak news from the International Food Policy Research Institute. Around 40% of the world's agricultural land i s seriously degraded - 75% of centralAmerica's cropland, 11% of Asia's, 20% of Africa's. Researchers studying satellite data blame wind and water erosion, repeated cropping, mechanical tilling and bad water management. This is grim news: there will be another 1.5bn mouths to feed by 2020. Director Per Pinstrup-Andersen says \"Small farmers ought to have access to drought-tolerant seed, insect-resistant seed, pest-resistant seed, the kinds of things small farmers need in order to increase production.\" Spud you can really like Antibiotics work by killing bacteria. Potatoes just discourage them with a polyphenol oxidase. This has given researchers at the Miami University of Ohio, worried about antibiotic resistance, something they can sink their teeth into. \"We found that a water extract of the outer few millimetres of a potato inhibited the attachment of an oral streptococcus to the substance it uses for attachment to the tooth surfaces,\" Marjorie Cowan told the American Society for Microbiology. \"It also prevented the attachment of E.coli which cause urinary tract infections to its host cells.\"",

Nearly a quarter of the UK's 18 million over-50s are active computer users; more than four million of them own PCs and a further 600,000 have access to computers at community centres, colleges and libraries. But, until now, there has been little information about the electronic habits of the growing numbers of older people regularly using information and communications technology (ICT). </p> <p>The national charity Age Concern, supported by Microsoft, has attempted to fill that void by commissioning a study of ICT use among the over-50s. During April 2000, the British Market Research Bureau surveyed 1,250 older people, asking them about their use of, and attitudes to, technology and its effect on their lives. The charity says that the survey, published last week, is the largest of its kind undertaken in the UK. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the study shows that some trends in the population as a whole are reflected by the older generation: for example, males from socio-economic classes A, B and C1 are the predominant group of computer users. </p> <p>The study also found that people in the 50-64 age bracket are much more likely to be ICT-literate than those aged 65 and above - the proportions for each age group are 38% and 11% respectively. Even so, that's a lot of over-65s, and Age Concern claims ICT is now the fourth most popular leisure pursuit among older people. </p> <p>Keeping in touch is cited as the greatest benefit of ICT, according to respondents - over 80% of users rely on word-processing applications for letter-writing and nearly 60% regularly send and receive e-mail. </p> <p>Roughly half of all users also surf the internet, and among this group education scores highly: 64% use learning, fact-finding and reference sites; 58% research travel; 28% seek financial information and 24% visit news and current affairs sites. However, only 22% are willing to shop online - in fact, 70% are put off by worries about internet credit card fraud. </p> <p>The survey reveals that other popular uses for home computing include gaming (39%) and keeping personal and household accounts (35%). The over-50s spend an average of nine hours each week on their computers, although men devote more time to their screens than women (ten and seven hours respectively). Few users find the technology intimidating with more than 80% saying it is very easy to use. Two-thirds of users claim ICT has made a positive difference to their lives. </p> <p>Of those interviewees who do not use computers, 60% give \"lack of interest\" as the reason, although nearly one-fifth feel that computers are \"too expensive\" and 15% believe the new technology is \"not for people of our age\". Only 8% admit being \"frightened of computers\". </p> <p>\"IT can bring enormous pleasure and benefit to older people. I don't know how I'd manage without it,\" says Peter Cook, 68. He bought his first computer in 1987 and has had six machines since then. \"I use the computer to keep in touch with family and friends, to do my accounts, for inter net banking and to help my son with his IT A-level studies,\" he says. Although Cook retired in 1991, he has turned his interest to good use as a freelance webmaster producing an internet advice page for DIY chain B &amp; Q. </p> <p>Older people are often introduced to new technologies by the \"trickle-up\" effect from younger family members. Dieter Wolfskelh, a 75-year-old former foundry worker from Rugby, is typical. </p> <p>\"My daughter and her husband use computers every day for work and they both have machines at home,\" he explains. \"What's more, my son has become a dab hand at renovating cast-off computers and he and his youngsters are keen internet enthusiasts.\" </p> <p>And it's not just PCs that are bringing technology into Wolfskehl's retirement: his daughter has just bought him his first mobile phone. </p> <p>Having studied the findings, Age Concern intends to encourage more over-50s to exploit new technologies by collaborating with Microsoft to bring ICT training to older people.

Actually, Devil Inside doesn't just pinch from RE: the third person action is equally reminiscent of Tomb Raider and the rest. As Dave and glamorous alter ego Deva, your aim is to investigate a good, old-fashioned, haunted mansion. </p> <p>But what lifts this from run-of-the-mill to Running Man is the gameshow backdrop. Your every move is followed by a ravenous studio audience that's kept in touch by cameramen who follow you throughout the game. </p> <p>The cheesy Leslie Crowther-isms of the host and the whooping of the crowd are offset by some genuinely unnerving moments when, in true Blair Witch fashion, the picture starts breaking up. </p> <p>Apparently violence is popular - shoot the head off a zombie and the ratings soar. Dally, however, and the watching millions grow impatient as you struggle with some occasionally obscure puzzles. </p> <p>If you can get the nausea-inducing camera to calm down then the meticulous d\u00e9cor will impress while the ironic spot effects do their job. </p> <p>The cross dressing element throws in a wee bit of strategy - Dave is better with guns, catsuited Deva can cast the odd spell - but really this is an old fashioned zombie blaster in post modern clothing. (GH)</p> <p> <strong>It's simply not good enough<br> Martian Gothic: Unification</strong><br> PC \u00a329.99 Take 2/Creative Reality * <br> </p> <p> How refreshing. In an age when your average manual can flatten a hamster, here's a game with documentation that's positively bijou. </p> <p>There's one good reason for this: with only 11 in-game controls, Martian Gothic is very simple to learn. </p> <p>What's more, the explanatory text runs to a princely 167 words (summary: you are on an expedition to investigate a disaster on a Martian outpost). </p> <p>Saves time, saves trees - and utterly fails to create any atmosphere. </p> <p>You'd have thought all this economy would mean Martian Gothic was easy to play. Alas, nothing could be further from the truth. </p> <p>The lack of mouse control means you're stuck with cumbersome keyboard commands, and instead of highlighting hotspots with your cursor, you have to manoeuvre your three characters around the screen until they are facing an object they can interact with. </p> <p>Your surroundings do not update dynamically; instead, the field of play is divided into hundreds of tiny areas, so after half a dozen steps the screen changes and you're viewing the action from a different angle. As well as being disorienting, this makes interacting with objects even harder. </p> <p>Worst of all, the developers have taken the bewildering decision not to allow free saves. You can save your progress only at certain places in the game, and even then the number of slots is severely limited. In a particularly perverse touch, the first save point is in a room occupied by a hungry zombie - and at this stage, you don't have a weapon. </p> <p>Cheers, Creative. </p> <p>The difficulty of saving is all the more frustrating when death comes so easily. Ammunition (once you have a weapon, that is) and health boosts are thin on the ground, and your principal enemies are - get this - indestructible. Your best long-term ploy is to run away, which, with the fiddly control system and the fast, limpet-like zombies, is akin to crossing a tightrope on a tricycle. </p> <p>The rest of the \"enjoyment\" consists in hunting down various keys for various doors, which involves scouring walls, searching dead bodies (which may not be dead) and sending items to your pals through a base-wide network of vacuum tubes. </p> <p>At this point you may be starting to wonder why this is all sounding so familiar. Non-dynamic view, save points, switching between characters, undead nasties, no mouse, poor noticeability of usable objects... yup, it's Resident Evil in space, complete with all the old annoyances, and the added minus of mediocre graphics and music. </p> <p>Why? (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Wario Land 3</strong><br> Game Boy Color \u00a324.99 Nintendo *** <br> </p> <p> In the 80s, Nintendo conquered the world with platform games based on its Mario character, and in the early 90s, Sega did even better with Sonic the Hedgehog on the MegaDrive. </p> <p>But hile the days of the two-dimensional sideways-scrolling platform game are long gone on most systems, the genre lives on on Nintendo's hand-held Game Boy Color. </p> <p>But you quite often wonder if it's worth the effort. </p> <p>Wario Land 3 continues the Game Boy-only series of platform games featuring Mario's badder alter ego, and it offers pretty much the mixture as before. As in Wario Land 2, the invincible Wario has some amusing reactions when attacked by certain enemies. He may, for example, burst into flames; he may turn into a vampire, or a snowman, or even a ball of string. The animations are nice but the designers are in danger of scraping through the bottom of the barrel. </p> <p>One novel feature - the alternation between day and night - falls foul of the Game Boy Color screen, which lacks a brightness control. Even the \"day\" scenes are too dark for me. </p> <p>To add insult to injury, you can turn also into \"Blind Wario\", which makes the screen turn black. Unless you've memorised the scene, it's rather hard to move around. </p> <p>Still, one mustn't be too churlish. Wario Land 3 has excellent graphics, acceptable sound, and packs a lot of activity into a very small space. If you missed the great age of platform games, this is a terrific example of the genre. </p> <p>If you loved Super Mario Bros or Sonic 2, finishing Wario Land 3 will not bring back your lost youth, but it might remind you why they were such fun at the time.

      "bodyText": "Zap the zombies, win a cheer The Devil Inside PC \u00a334.99 Cryo Interactive *** Never mind wearing its influences on its sleeve, The Devil Inside has nipped down to Bond Street and turned them into a rather smart suit. But before lawyers from Resident Evil come calling, it must be remembered that Hubert Chardot, Devil Inside supremo, was also responsible for Alone In The Dark - the ageing PC title cited as a major inspiration for, you've guessed it, Resident Evil. Confused? Actually, Devil Inside doesn't just pinch from RE: the third person action is equally reminiscent of Tomb Raider and the rest. As Dave and glamorous alter ego Deva, your aim is to investigate a good, old-fashioned, haunted mansion. But what lifts this from run-of-the-mill to Running Man is the gameshow backdrop. Your every move is followed by a ravenous studio audience that's kept in touch by cameramen who follow you throughout the game. The cheesy Leslie Crowther-isms of the host and the whooping of the crowd are offset by some genuinely unnerving moments when, in true Blair Witch fashion, the picture starts breaking up. Apparently violence is popular - shoot the head off a zombie and the ratings soar. Dally, however, and the watching millions grow impatient as you struggle with some occasionally obscure puzzles. If you can get the nausea-inducing camera to calm down then the meticulous d\u00e9cor will impress while the ironic spot effects do their job. The cross dressing element throws in a wee bit of strategy - Dave is better with guns, catsuited Deva can cast the odd spell - but really this is an old fashioned zombie blaster in post modern clothing. (GH) It's simply not good enough Martian Gothic: Unification PC \u00a329.99 Take 2/Creative Reality * How refreshing. In an age when your average manual can flatten a hamster, here's a game with documentation that's positively bijou. There's one good reason for this: with only 11 in-game controls, Martian Gothic is very simple to learn. What's more, the explanatory text runs to a princely 167 words (summary: you are on an expedition to investigate a disaster on a Martian outpost). Saves time, saves trees - and utterly fails to create any atmosphere. You'd have thought all this economy would mean Martian Gothic was easy to play. Alas, nothing could be further from the truth. The lack of mouse control means you're stuck with cumbersome keyboard commands, and instead of highlighting hotspots with your cursor, you have to manoeuvre your three characters around the screen until they are facing an object they can interact with. Your surroundings do not update dynamically; instead, the field of play is divided into hundreds of tiny areas, so after half a dozen steps the screen changes and you're viewing the action from a different angle. As well as being disorienting, this makes interacting with objects even harder. Worst of all, the developers have taken the bewildering decision not to allow free saves. You can save your progress only at certain places in the game, and even then the number of slots is severely limited. In a particularly perverse touch, the first save point is in a room occupied by a hungry zombie - and at this stage, you don't have a weapon. Cheers, Creative. The difficulty of saving is all the more frustrating when death comes so easily. Ammunition (once you have a weapon, that is) and health boosts are thin on the ground, and your principal enemies are - get this - indestructible. Your best long-term ploy is to run away, which, with the fiddly control system and the fast, limpet-like zombies, is akin to crossing a tightrope on a tricycle. The rest of the \"enjoyment\" consists in hunting down various keys for various doors, which involves scouring walls, searching dead bodies (which may not be dead) and sending items to your pals through a base-wide network of vacuum tubes. At this point you may be starting to wonder why this is all sounding so familiar. Non-dynamic view, save points, switching between characters, undead nasties, no mouse, poor noticeability of usable objects... yup, it's Resident Evil in space, complete with all the old annoyances, and the added minus of mediocre graphics and music. Why? (AB) Wario Land 3 Game Boy Color \u00a324.99 Nintendo *** In the 80s, Nintendo conquered the world with platform games based on its Mario character, and in the early 90s, Sega did even better with Sonic the Hedgehog on the MegaDrive. But hile the days of the two-dimensional sideways-scrolling platform game are long gone on most systems, the genre lives on on Nintendo's hand-held Game Boy Color. But you quite often wonder if it's worth the effort. Wario Land 3 continues the Game Boy-only series of platform games featuring Mario's badder alter ego, and it offers pretty much the mixture as before. As in Wario Land 2, the invincible Wario has some amusing reactions when attacked by certain enemies. He may, for example, burst into flames; he may turn into a vampire, or a snowman, or even a ball of string. The animations are nice but the designers are in danger of scraping through the bottom of the barrel. One novel feature - the alternation between day and night - falls foul of the Game Boy Color screen, which lacks a brightness control. Even the \"day\" scenes are too dark for me. To add insult to injury, you can turn also into \"Blind Wario\", which makes the screen turn black. Unless you've memorised the scene, it's rather hard to move around. Still, one mustn't be too churlish. Wario Land 3 has excellent graphics, acceptable sound, and packs a lot of activity into a very small space. If you missed the great age of platform games, this is a terrific example of the genre. If you loved Super Mario Bros or Sonic 2, finishing Wario Land 3 will not bring back your lost youth, but it might remind you why they were such fun at the time. (JS)",

      "body": "<p>The discovery that spices can protect bacteria from radiation might lead to a way of reducing the side-effects of radiotherapy for cancer patients, according to Indian researchers. </p> <p>A flash of radiation was once considered a safe and easy way to kill bugs and preserve food without chemicals. The method failed to curry favour with the public although it is used in some parts of the world for decontaminating hospital food and ration packs for the military and for sterilising pharmaceuticals and medical products. </p> <p>The technique is likely to come to the fore again as new licences have been granted recently in the US for irradiating minced beef in an effort to reduce food poisoning from burgers. Food technologist Arun Sharma and his colleagues at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai, have now shown that food irradiation may not be fully effective if a food is spicy unless a powerful dose of radiation is used. </p> <p>The natural chemicals which give red chilli powder, black pepper and turmeric their rich flavours and aroma, somehow shield bacteria like E coli and Bacillus megath erium and its cousin pumilus from lethal gamma rays although at a lower intensity than is commonly used to sterilise food. </p> <p>The team added spices bought from their local market in Mombaito a warm broth of lab-grown bacteria which was exposed to a blast of gamma radiation. Some unspiced bacteria were left to fend for themselves in the petri dish. The results were pretty conclusive: the spice-free bugs were quickly killed off by the radiation blast, while the seasoned microbes continued to thrive. </p> <p>The team also extracted DNA from the bugs to see whether adding spices could protect the microbe's naked genetic material. Again, the results were positive. Just a pinch of chilli pepper or turmeric was enough to provide an effective radiation shield. The researchers believe the finding could lead to a way to protect healthy tissues for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and so reduce the side-effects, such as nausea and vomiting, headaches, skin damage, diarrhoea and hair loss. </p> <p>\"This finding was contrary to expectations,\" says Sharma, \"The protection of microbes we saw may essentially be due to the protection of their DNA by the constituents of spices.\" The researchers found that red-hot chilli pepper provided the bugs with the highest level of protection, followed by black pepper and turmeric. </p> <p>There are various strong chemical antioxidants in spices, for instance, chilli, black pepper and turmeric contain capsanthin, piperine and curcumin (the yellow pigment in turmeric whose chemical name is something of a mouthful: 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3- methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione). Sharma points out that there are likely to be several other compounds, including carbohydrates and proteins in the spices that might be working together, to provide protection from the radiation. </p> <p>Scientists at Leicester University have been investigating the ability of the turmeric ingredient curcumin, used as a drug alone, to suppress tumours, so there is a growing interest in the spice from the medical point of view. Preliminary clinical trials are already under way in Leicester led by scientists Andy Gescher and Will Steward. </p> <p>Could we soon see chilli pepper and curry powder as part of the treatment for cancer patients? The possibility of coupling these compounds with more conventional cancer therapies might have benefits. \"Spices potentially can offer protection to organisms against the damaging effects of gamma radiation, and also offer hope for the development of better radioprotective agents,\" believes Sharma. </p> <p>\"Certainly antioxidants have been used in experimental trials to see whether they could be used to protect healthy cells in radiotherapy although they have not been used routinely,\" explains Jo Reynolds of the Cancer Research Campaign. She points out that while the Sharma study is very interest ing, bacterial cells are so very different from human cells that it would be a \"major extrapolation\" to say whether these antioxidants might work in humans at all. </p> <p>There is evidence from the Leicester groups and elsewhere that substances such as curcumin in turmeric, do have the potential to reduce the risk of cancer. Reynolds adds that carefully designed studies will be needed before using such substances in trials to see whether they would protect healthy tissues in radiotherapy. </p> <p>\u0095 The Indian researchers published their results in more detail this month in the Journal Of Agricultural And Food Chemistry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The discovery that spices can protect bacteria from radiation might lead to a way of reducing the side-effects of radiotherapy for cancer patients, according to Indian researchers. A flash of radiation was once considered a safe and easy way to kill bugs and preserve food without chemicals. The method failed to curry favour with the public although it is used in some parts of the world for decontaminating hospital food and ration packs for the military and for sterilising pharmaceuticals and medical products. The technique is likely to come to the fore again as new licences have been granted recently in the US for irradiating minced beef in an effort to reduce food poisoning from burgers. Food technologist Arun Sharma and his colleagues at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai, have now shown that food irradiation may not be fully effective if a food is spicy unless a powerful dose of radiation is used. The natural chemicals which give red chilli powder, black pepper and turmeric their rich flavours and aroma, somehow shield bacteria like E coli and Bacillus megath erium and its cousin pumilus from lethal gamma rays although at a lower intensity than is commonly used to sterilise food. The team added spices bought from their local market in Mombaito a warm broth of lab-grown bacteria which was exposed to a blast of gamma radiation. Some unspiced bacteria were left to fend for themselves in the petri dish. The results were pretty conclusive: the spice-free bugs were quickly killed off by the radiation blast, while the seasoned microbes continued to thrive. The team also extracted DNA from the bugs to see whether adding spices could protect the microbe's naked genetic material. Again, the results were positive. Just a pinch of chilli pepper or turmeric was enough to provide an effective radiation shield. The researchers believe the finding could lead to a way to protect healthy tissues for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and so reduce the side-effects, such as nausea and vomiting, headaches, skin damage, diarrhoea and hair loss. \"This finding was contrary to expectations,\" says Sharma, \"The protection of microbes we saw may essentially be due to the protection of their DNA by the constituents of spices.\" The researchers found that red-hot chilli pepper provided the bugs with the highest level of protection, followed by black pepper and turmeric. There are various strong chemical antioxidants in spices, for instance, chilli, black pepper and turmeric contain capsanthin, piperine and curcumin (the yellow pigment in turmeric whose chemical name is something of a mouthful: 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3- methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione). Sharma points out that there are likely to be several other compounds, including carbohydrates and proteins in the spices that might be working together, to provide protection from the radiation. Scientists at Leicester University have been investigating the ability of the turmeric ingredient curcumin, used as a drug alone, to suppress tumours, so there is a growing interest in the spice from the medical point of view. Preliminary clinical trials are already under way in Leicester led by scientists Andy Gescher and Will Steward. Could we soon see chilli pepper and curry powder as part of the treatment for cancer patients? The possibility of coupling these compounds with more conventional cancer therapies might have benefits. \"Spices potentially can offer protection to organisms against the damaging effects of gamma radiation, and also offer hope for the development of better radioprotective agents,\" believes Sharma. \"Certainly antioxidants have been used in experimental trials to see whether they could be used to protect healthy cells in radiotherapy although they have not been used routinely,\" explains Jo Reynolds of the Cancer Research Campaign. She points out that while the Sharma study is very interest ing, bacterial cells are so very different from human cells that it would be a \"major extrapolation\" to say whether these antioxidants might work in humans at all. There is evidence from the Leicester groups and elsewhere that substances such as curcumin in turmeric, do have the potential to reduce the risk of cancer. Reynolds adds that carefully designed studies will be needed before using such substances in trials to see whether they would protect healthy tissues in radiotherapy. \u0095 The Indian researchers published their results in more detail this month in the Journal Of Agricultural And Food Chemistry.",

Your friends are coming round this afternoon to watch the match, and everything must be perfect. You'll spend an emotive couple of hours cheering on your team, and afterwards you'll discuss the tactics and drama in increasingly boozy, argumentative fashion. A great sporting afternoon. </p> <p>But this ain't football. You're watching a videogame tournament. And videogames are the new sport. </p> <p>Yeah, right. Surely videogames are played alone by \"young men sitting in their stained, darkened bedrooms\"? That's the smugly ignorant view of crumbly punk kid Tony Parsons, and typical of wider prejudice. But the largest growth area in videogames over the last few years has been social play. Tens of thousands of people all over the world regularly meet on the internet to play against each other, and the large majority of \"casual gamers\" - the affluent, intelligent twenty- and thirty-somethings that the videogame industry has succeeded so remarkably in seducing over the past five years - use videogames together, sitting around the PlayStation just as earlier generations might have gathered round the wireless or the cribbage board. </p> <p>So we have a new form of game that is highly social, fast-moving and competitive. If shooting real guns is an Olympic sport, why not the railguns and rocket-launchers of Quake, which, moreover, incorporates elements of high-speed spatial tactics and teamplay? In the US, the groovily named Cyberathletes' Professional League already organises regular tournaments at which the prize money exceeds $100,000. Qualifying rounds for these tournaments are also held here, at The Playing Fields videogame bar in Whitfield Street, London, and now we have our own version of the league, the UK PC Games Championships. </p> <p>But surely, in order to qualify as a sport, an activity must involve hard, sweating physical activity, rather than just sitting at a table with mouse and keyboard? Edward Watson, manager of The Playing Fields, doesn't think so: he calls this prejudice \"sports fascism\". And this isn't because he's biased against the physically excellent: he used to be a modern pentathlete, and a soldier, himself. </p> <p>\"When I was an athlete at school,\" Watson remembers, \"we were effectively fed all the non-athletic people as targets. I'd have a great time playing football because I'd just power past these guys. But now I look back at it and I think, 'That guy who always played at left back, who was a slightly tubby fella - he must have had a miserable time.' And here we are with a sport [videogames] where for those guys it's kind of their revenge, because you don't need to have any physical, god-given right to be good at it.\" </p> <p>So a game of multiplayer Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament is actually a revolutionary democratisation of the nature of sport. Laurels are no longer determined simply by the tyranny of genes. As Watson points out, in this new sport there is no need to segregate women and men, because physical strength doesn't come into it. And one of the top players at the recent Birmingham UK PC Games Championships, he says, was disabled, happily beating off the able-bodied on a level playing-field. </p> <p>But just what is it about fragging that is particularly sport-like? \"Take away what's physically happening,\" Watson insists, \"and you couldn't tell the difference between what's going on here and a professional sports tournament. The tactics that can be employed in a videogame are as varied as those that can be employed in any game. There's always going to be that human element where the best player gets beaten by someone who's not expected to beat him, because he uses a surprising tactic, and the other guy's slightly off his aim because he was on the beer the night before...\" </p> <p>The crucial question is how you could make Quake 3 work as a spectator sport that people might want to watch as well as play. Watson points out that they make exciting television coverage already out of the Tour de France and Formula One racing, both of which are actually incredibly boring. He acknowledges that it's the personalities that really get people interested in any sport: Schumacher versus Coulthard, the glory days of snooker with Alex Higgins and Steve Davis, or Eric Bristow chucking darts against Jocky Wilson. </p> <p>The videogamer personalities of the future are already bubbling under among the elite group of professional videogamers who tour the world and making a living out of their \"sport\". Two of this country's best are Sujoy Roy and Amir Haleem (Haleem won the $10,000 first prize in the Dallas Frag 3 competition last year). They are now based in Stockholm, building a \"gamer lifestyle\" website, xsreality.com, which is already attracting huge interest from sponsors. </p> <p>Being a pro gamer is a serious business: like any other sportsperson, you have to devote hours every day to practice to have a hope of winning big. \"I was getting lazy after I won the last event,\" Haleem admits wryly. \"But now we're doing two to three hours a day of playing. It might seem fairly hilarious to the average person that we actually sit and talk about tactics after playing games. But if you want to be the best then you have to do these things.\" </p> <p>Haleem also points out that the increasing popularity of teamplay tournaments, rather than one-on-one fragging contests, brings videogames even closer to sport: \"It's kind of like a game of football, 10 players on 10, with the whole teamwork aspect. I think teamplay is going to be the standard now.\" </p> <p>It is an extraordinary sign of the increasing commercial viability of videogames as a competitive sport that Haleem's partner, Sujoy Roy, gave up a lucrative career as an investment banker with JP Morgan in order to concentrate on his Quake. \"To be honest, it was just dull,\" laughs Roy of his \"proper\" job. \"This was an opportunity to do something I enjoy. There's lots of companies pumping money into gaming, it's just getting bigger all the time, and we knew there was a living to be made here.\" </p> <p> Television companies are catching on. Edward Watson is currently in negotiations with British terrestrial channels to televise the next UK PC Games Championships at the end of this year. And even buttoned-up old Auntie is eyeing the bandwagon, with a programme called Bleeding Thumbs in early development, which will apparently incorporate celebrities playing videogames against each other.

Edward Watson happily imagines the apparatus of commentary and argument working just as it does for other sports: \"You have slow-motion replays.

Let's look at the reverse angle - you can see where the rocket went. This was never gonna work!'

But Boo's fate was little surprise for senior, wiser figures within the e-world. It's like any business in any sector, if you start off with a fundamentally flawed business model and manage it badly it's highly likely you will go out of business, insists chief executive of Just-sites.com, Allan Davies. </p> <p> But what was flawed about the business model? After all, when Boo.com was launched it was feted in many parts of the media as a revolution in e-commerce. </p> <p> \"I am amazed that any investor would have believed the stories about this business,\" says Davies. He says it was like deciding to open a clothes store on the high street with M&amp;S on one side and C&amp;A on the other, then selling a reduced range of goods at the same price and making it very difficult to get in the front door. He admits his comments are more acidic than most, fuelled by the fact that he has spent the last six months working hard to raise money from venture capitalists, despite the fact his online business is making money. </p> <p> Just-sites.com, is in the more fashionable business to business (B2B) sector and provides information for companies on anything from market research to the clothing industry. Davies suggests there are lots of online businesses based on solid business propositions, but they do not grab the headlines. </p> <p> Visiting the Boo.com we site now is a sad experience, which highlights the disappointment of its brief but notorious life. Boo.com generated huge expectations but failed to fulfill them: in the About Boo section, the site still predicts it will become the world's leading online retailer of fashion and sportswear, and create an awesome virtual shopping experience surpassing anything else on the web. </p> <p> Is the merciless criticism justified? Boo has been pilloried, says independent internet consultant, Naunton Dickins. But that is nothing unusual. There are companies going belly up every day of the week. The only difference is Boo made so much noise that everyone wanted it to fail. It was young, attractive , had huge amounts of money and great dreams and the public was keen to see the first public internet failure. </p> <p> Internet analysts argue that Boo was flawed because it could not offer discounted products, its range was limited, and the snazzy graphics meant pages took ages to download. The service was designed for computers with 56K modems. Without one, you suffered. The company was hugely over-ambitious in its attempt to launch in 18 countries simultaneously and burned cash at rate guaranteed to make any traditional bank manager choke on his lunch. </p> <p> A nother criticism was that Boo concentrated too much on the glamour side of PR and marketing - including lavish parties around the world - but ignored the boring and essential stuff: ensuring you can efficiently fulfil your customers' orders. Management consultants will probably present Boo as a classic example of how not to launch and run an internet company. But it is easy to put the boot in and ignore any positive contribution Boo could have made to the development of the online industry. </p> <p> \"I think its most positive contribution is to press the re-set button on people's thinking about investing in internet companies,\" says Davies. \"There is a lot of garbage talked about the dot.com businesses. The best thing to come out of this will be that people will be much more aware that fantasy business plans are things of the past. No one is going to invest in silly business ideas any more.\" </p> <p> News of Boo's collapse spread panic through the new dot.coms. Morale-raising internal meetings have been held at some, and PR companies have rushed out press releases emphasising the strong business credentials of the companies they represent. Simon Steward, vice president of the venture capitalist company, Think Ventures, says Boo has taught investors a lot.</p> <p> Now they should know they have to invest in high quality businesses because the perils of unproven internet ventures have been made quite clear. He explains: \"You need to be looking for experienced people to operate online businesses. You need to be looking for real talent and well-argued and well-reasoned business models.\" In the light of the sudden departure of Miss Boo, many industry insiders are suggesting that traditional bricks and mortar companies are starting to strike back. Traditional players like M&amp;S can watch pioneers like Boo fail and learn from them. They can move more gradually as they have more secure funding, and they can also move at the pace of their customers as they become more used to the idea of shopping online. </p> <p> Bricks and mortar companies have an advantage because they have a brand. People are able to guess the web address and the brand gives some security and trust. E-commerce begins with silicon and ends with trust. They also have a reassuring high street presence where customers can go if they have a problem. Neither do they have to spend millions on brand recognition in each country. </p> <p> New technology companies are realising that they can learn a lot from old style land-based businesses in the retail sector. Last year Amazon was rumoured to be in the process of striking deals which would have seen Amazon-branded bookshops in supermarkets. Recently ThinkNatural.com, the health and nutrition e-tailer, attracted \u00a33 million worth of investment from Kingfisher, the retail group which owns the Superdrug and Woolworth chains. In chatrooms on business sites, directors of established companies have been reiterating that the internet is no different to any other form of business and needs to follow the same rules. They charged Boo with making the basic business error of not ensuring it had adequate demand and supply to survive its short term start up costs. </p> <p> Despite Boo's high profile failure, most senior financial analysts remain utterly convinced that e-commerce is the future. \"I think the speed of the transition to the internet has been over-hyped but it will inevitably have a huge impact,\" explains Steward. The internet is fundamentally altering how we communicate: the revolution has just started. \"In any promising new market,\" he adds, \"there is a natural tendency for expectations, investments and prices to overshoot.\" </p> <p> The growth of the internet is being driven now by the introduction of interactive TV and mobile phones that will all create new markets and new waves of activity. Despite the fact that Boo crashed in the highly-competitive clothing sector, the vast majority of analysts do not think selling clothes on the internet is doomed. They say many people are still stuck in the mindset of a traditional retail environment, but forecast that this will change. For example, it is suggested that people could go shopping offline and take photographs of themselves wearing an outfit. After showing it to their friends, they might make the actual purchase online because it is more convenient. </p> <p> Some e-commerce directors argue that men can be very conservative in their shopping habits, and could be persuaded to buy online for a reduced price as they know what they like and usually find shopping boring. But it is still not all over for Boo. With the liquidators trying to auction off the company's remains, some people still harbour hopes for Europe's first high profile internet casualty. \"Boo is probably the biggest known internet brand now,\" says Naunton Dickins, an independent internet consultant. \"Everyone knows about Boo.com. I have a weird feeling they might rise again.\"</p>",

They say many people are still stuck in the mindset of a traditional retail environment, but forecast that this will change. For example, it is suggested that people could go shopping offline and take photographs of themselves wearing an outfit. After showing it to their friends, they might make the actual purchase online because it is more convenient. Some e-commerce directors argue that men can be very conservative in their shopping habits, and could be persuaded to buy online for a reduced price as they know what they like and usually find shopping boring. But it is still not all over for Boo. With the liquidators trying to auction off the company's remains, some people still harbour hopes for Europe's first high profile internet casualty. \"Boo is probably the biggest known internet brand now,\" says Naunton Dickins, an independent internet consultant. \"Everyone knows about Boo.com. I have a weird feeling they might rise again.\"",
