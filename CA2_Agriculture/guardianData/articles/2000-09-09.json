      "body": "<p>The battle over the London Stock Exchange will intensify this week as OM Group releases the formal offer document for its \u00a3808 million bid, and Exchange chairman Don Cruickshank faces a hostile audience at its annual meeting on Thursday. </p> <p>The Swedish group will press its case for a takeover as the only credible way forward for the Exchange. It will underline its excellent record, superior technology and its management skills, contrasting these with the Exchange's 'outdated' idea of merging with Frankfurt. </p> <p>Cruickshank is expected to mount a strong defence of that merger at Thursday's annual meeting. The Exchange sees the deal as central to its battle against OM's bid and remains convinced it is the right way forward. But he is unlikely to offernew evidence in favour of the merger, nor to answer questions on key areas such as settlement and trading. </p> <p>The Exchange believes it is constrained by being in a formal offer period because of the OM bid. But it is also likely to keep its best ammunition for later in the battle. </p> <p>A number of broking firms are, however, expected to protest by voting against Cruickshank's election as chairman and the reappointment of Gavin Casey as chief executive and Michael Marks as deputy chairman.

      "bodyText": "The battle over the London Stock Exchange will intensify this week as OM Group releases the formal offer document for its \u00a3808 million bid, and Exchange chairman Don Cruickshank faces a hostile audience at its annual meeting on Thursday. The Swedish group will press its case for a takeover as the only credible way forward for the Exchange. It will underline its excellent record, superior technology and its management skills, contrasting these with the Exchange's 'outdated' idea of merging with Frankfurt. Cruickshank is expected to mount a strong defence of that merger at Thursday's annual meeting. The Exchange sees the deal as central to its battle against OM's bid and remains convinced it is the right way forward. But he is unlikely to offernew evidence in favour of the merger, nor to answer questions on key areas such as settlement and trading. The Exchange believes it is constrained by being in a formal offer period because of the OM bid. But it is also likely to keep its best ammunition for later in the battle. A number of broking firms are, however, expected to protest by voting against Cruickshank's election as chairman and the reappointment of Gavin Casey as chief executive and Michael Marks as deputy chairman. 'There will be some protest votes' said Justin Urquhart-Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. Another large international firm said it would not vote against the directors, but added that this was simply because now is not a good time for a wholesale change in management: 'It is in the interests of stability. We do not want it to be seen as tacit approval of the board.'

      "body": "<p>Starting college in the next few weeks? Congratulations: in three years' time you can look forward to being the proud possessor of a degree - and debts of about \u00a324,000. </p> <p>Unless your parents have deep pockets - and are willing to dip into them on a regular basis - you will end up meeting your own living costs during higher education, and possibly tuition fees as well. Total student debt is estimated to stand at \u00a33.5bn in the UK, and only 45 per cent of students feel they can access enough money, according to Barclays Bank. </p> <p>Andrew Wilkinson is just entering his second year at St Andrews in Scotland, where he is studying history. He has already used a \u00a32,700 student loan, and has spent the summer working to pay off a \u00a3500 overdraft. Even though ways to spend money are limited in St Andrews, he expects to owe about \u00a38,000 at the end of his four-year course. 'The cost of living - food and other basic things - is really shocking. And it's probably worse for people studying in cities like Edinburgh, where there's the temptation of clubs and a better range of shops.' </p> <p>The increased cost of studying since the abolition of grants in 1998 has forced many students to take on jobs during term time. Twenty-five per cent of students claim to work 40 hours or more a week to supplement their income, while a further 18 per cent say they work for more than 30 hours, according to research by a special bursary website, freefund.com. Nearly half felt that working was having a detrimental effect on their studies and overall grades. </p> <p>The prospect of heavy debt has proved too daunting for others. Freefund.com found that some 30,000 A-level students this year have decided not to continue with their education because of the financial burden. Iain Aitken, its managing director, says: 'This is another terrible form of the brain drain. We have thousands of talented students who, because of cost, are having their development stunted. And as student debt continues to increase, this problem is set to worsen.' </p> <p>The situation has become so severe that competitions are now dropping free holidays and cars in favour of educational funding as preferred prizes. The Evening Standard in London has been running a draw for funding of \u00a315,000 over three years, while Coca- Cola has been auctioning a higher education package worth up to \u00a325,000 on its website. Bidding for the package, which has proved the most popular item in the auction so far, ends tonight at 10pm. </p> <p>Coca-Cola's UK communications director, Andrew Coker, said the company had been 'staggered' by the demand for a student fees and expenses prize when it surveyed customers on what they wanted as auction items. 'Our understanding of the group that we researched - 16-to-28-year-olds - was that they wanted round-the-world trips, tickets to first-night shows, exclusive parties and other entertainment-based things. But what came back was a much more serious-minded response. They wanted help to pay for education that would help them achieve the lifestyle they wanted.' </p> <p>Coca-Cola's research indicates that young people are now well aware of the considerable career advantages that education can provide. Today's students are the high earners of tomorrow: having a degree could add some \u00a3400,000 to lifetime earnings, according to Robert Skidelsky of the Social Market Foundation. The benefits can be felt straight after graduation, with City firms such as Andersen Consulting offering bonuses of \u00a310,000 to attract the cream of graduates. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, financial institutions - particularly the high street banks - are keen to sign up students as soon as possible. A customer nurtured through three years of college and several years of debt thereafter is likely to become a lucrative and loyal source of business. </p> <p>But while banks have traditionally competed on the value of 'freebies', such as vouchers for clothes, and CDs, the focus has now moved on to the size of overdraft and credit on offer. HSBC's Richard Beck says: 'In the past two or three years we've seen a slightly more realistic attitude develop amongst students. There's less choosing on the basis of freebies and more interest in overdrafts, local support, free borrowing and structured arrangements for repayment after university.' </p> <p>Martin Preater, student business officer at the Bath University branch of Barclays, agrees: 'People are changing from debt avoidance to debt management. If students are purely reliant on student loans, they usually come to see us within two to three months.' </p> <p>Students who are blas\u00e9 about money management could face more than repayment problems in the future. </p> <p>Mortgage lenders subtract annual repayments on outstanding loans from your gross annual salary before calculating how much you can borrow, so a large amount of student debt could easily prevent you getting the home you want. </p> <p>Worse still, some potential employers, particularly banks and other financial institutions, are wary of taking on recruits with a poor credit history. </p> <p>Caroline Andrews, a spokeswoman for Barclays, says credit references are checked if a job is being offered to an external candidate.'It would depend on the job being offered as to whether it makes a difference. But at the end of the day, our first responsibility is to our customers.'</p> <p><strong>The drama of making ends meet </strong></p> <p>Rachel Lane has only been at university for one year, but she has already built up debts of more than \u00a34,000. By the end of her three-year course in drama at Brunel University, she could easily owe more than \u00a312,000. </p> <p>Although Rachel claims not to be extravagant, spending about \u00a310 a week on food, and \u00a315 to \u00a320 on going out, she has used up a \u00a33,400 student loan, and the whole of her \u00a3750 overdraft with HSBC bank.</p> <p>She has tried to limit the damage by working as a waitress in the University's conference suites during term, and worked in a factory this summer to reduce her debts - earning \u00a34 an hour for packing and putting handles on metal jigs. She's coming up to her eighth week in the factory and has now paid off her overdraft.</p> <p>However, her expenses are about to rise. Last academic year, her costs were contained by the fact that she lived in university accommodation, costing just \u00a345 a week including bills. But this year she is moving into a house with friends: her weekly rent will be \u00a366 excluding bills.</p> <p>Rachel intends to take on a second job, probably bar work, when she returns to college this autumn, and has applied for a music lover's scholarship she found through the website freefund.com. But she says: 'It's incredibly daunting. I'm very worried about how to repay the money. If I go into acting, the likelihood of me being able to pay off the loan is remote. It puts me off the idea of doing doing a post-graduate course, which I would love to do.'</p> <p><strong>Bank on an interest-free overdraft </strong></p> <p>Size matters when choosing a bank account. The amount that can be borrowed as an interest-free overdraft will be the deciding factor for most students choosing a bank this year. Several, including Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Smile, offer overdraft facilities of up to \u00a32,000 for people taking four- or five-year courses. The most available for those on the average three-year course is \u00a31,800, from Smile and its parent, the Co-operative Bank. </p> <p>Applicants are not guaranteed to receive the maximum advertised. However, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, the Co-op and Smile all say it is rare for students not to be granted the full amount unless they ask for less, or have misused an account in the past.</p> <p>NatWest is not advertising a maximum interest-free overdraft limit this year, preferring to negotiate individually. This makes comparing its student account with rivals' more difficult, but it is worth considering as NatWest's unauthorised overdraft interest rate is the lowest on the market, at 17.81 per cent equivalent annual rate.</p> <p><strong> Money to burn </strong></p> <p>Estimated average student expenditure for 2000/01 (38 weeks) </p> <p>Inside London \u00a3 / Outside London \u00a3 </p> <p><strong> Tuition fees</strong> 1,050 / 1,050<br> <strong> Books/Equip. etc</strong> 251 / 251<br> <strong> Photocopying</strong> 82 / 82<br> <strong> Rent</strong> 2,396 / 1,683<br> <strong> Fuel</strong> 384 / 384<br> <strong> Food/Household goods</strong> 1,266 / 1,064<br> <strong> Laundry</strong> 102 / 102<br> <strong> Insurance</strong> 96 / 54<br> <strong> Clothing</strong> 410 / 410<br> <strong> Travel</strong> 696 / 444<br> <strong> Leisure</strong> 953 / 794<br> <strong> Total</strong> 7,686 / 6,318 </p> <p><strong>Potential income</strong></p> <p><strong>Loan (for 38 weeks)</strong> 3354 / 2722<br> <strong>Shortfall </strong>4332 / 3596 </p> <p>\u0095 Assumes first year undergraduate under the new support system receiving maximum loan entitlement (from LEA/parents/spouse), liable for full tuition fees.</p> <p>Source: National Union of Students</p>",

The Evening Standard in London has been running a draw for funding of \u00a315,000 over three years, while Coca- Cola has been auctioning a higher education package worth up to \u00a325,000 on its website. Bidding for the package, which has proved the most popular item in the auction so far, ends tonight at 10pm. Coca-Cola's UK communications director, Andrew Coker, said the company had been 'staggered' by the demand for a student fees and expenses prize when it surveyed customers on what they wanted as auction items. 'Our understanding of the group that we researched - 16-to-28-year-olds - was that they wanted round-the-world trips, tickets to first-night shows, exclusive parties and other entertainment-based things. But what came back was a much more serious-minded response. They wanted help to pay for education that would help them achieve the lifestyle they wanted.' Coca-Cola's research indicates that young people are now well aware of the considerable career advantages that education can provide. Today's students are the high earners of tomorrow: having a degree could add some \u00a3400,000 to lifetime earnings, according to Robert Skidelsky of the Social Market Foundation. The benefits can be felt straight after graduation, with City firms such as Andersen Consulting offering bonuses of \u00a310,000 to attract the cream of graduates. Not surprisingly, financial institutions - particularly the high street banks - are keen to sign up students as soon as possible. A customer nurtured through three years of college and several years of debt thereafter is likely to become a lucrative and loyal source of business. But while banks have traditionally competed on the value of 'freebies', such as vouchers for clothes, and CDs, the focus has now moved on to the size of overdraft and credit on offer. HSBC's Richard Beck says: 'In the past two or three years we've seen a slightly more realistic attitude develop amongst students. There's less choosing on the basis of freebies and more interest in overdrafts, local support, free borrowing and structured arrangements for repayment after university.' Martin Preater, student business officer at the Bath University branch of Barclays, agrees: 'People are changing from debt avoidance to debt management. If students are purely reliant on student loans, they usually come to see us within two to three months.' Students who are blas\u00e9 about money management could face more than repayment problems in the future. Mortgage lenders subtract annual repayments on outstanding loans from your gross annual salary before calculating how much you can borrow, so a large amount of student debt could easily prevent you getting the home you want. Worse still, some potential employers, particularly banks and other financial institutions, are wary of taking on recruits with a poor credit history. Caroline Andrews, a spokeswoman for Barclays, says credit references are checked if a job is being offered to an external candidate.'It would depend on the job being offered as to whether it makes a difference. But at the end of the day, our first responsibility is to our customers.' The drama of making ends meet Rachel Lane has only been at university for one year, but she has already built up debts of more than \u00a34,000. By the end of her three-year course in drama at Brunel University, she could easily owe more than \u00a312,000. Although Rachel claims not to be extravagant, spending about \u00a310 a week on food, and \u00a315 to \u00a320 on going out, she has used up a \u00a33,400 student loan, and the whole of her \u00a3750 overdraft with HSBC bank. She has tried to limit the damage by working as a waitress in the University's conference suites during term, and worked in a factory this summer to reduce her debts - earning \u00a34 an hour for packing and putting handles on metal jigs. She's coming up to her eighth week in the factory and has now paid off her overdraft. However, her expenses are about to rise. Last academic year, her costs were contained by the fact that she lived in university accommodation, costing just \u00a345 a week including bills. But this year she is moving into a house with friends: her weekly rent will be \u00a366 excluding bills. Rachel intends to take on a second job, probably bar work, when she returns to college this autumn, and has applied for a music lover's scholarship she found through the website freefund.com. But she says: 'It's incredibly daunting. I'm very worried about how to repay the money. If I go into acting, the likelihood of me being able to pay off the loan is remote. It puts me off the idea of doing doing a post-graduate course, which I would love to do.' Bank on an interest-free overdraft Size matters when choosing a bank account. The amount that can be borrowed as an interest-free overdraft will be the deciding factor for most students choosing a bank this year. Several, including Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Smile, offer overdraft facilities of up to \u00a32,000 for people taking four- or five-year courses. The most available for those on the average three-year course is \u00a31,800, from Smile and its parent, the Co-operative Bank. Applicants are not guaranteed to receive the maximum advertised. However, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, the Co-op and Smile all say it is rare for students not to be granted the full amount unless they ask for less, or have misused an account in the past. NatWest is not advertising a maximum interest-free overdraft limit this year, preferring to negotiate individually. This makes comparing its student account with rivals' more difficult, but it is worth considering as NatWest's unauthorised overdraft interest rate is the lowest on the market, at 17.81 per cent equivalent annual rate.

      "bodyText": "I don't like culture. Then you should take the Eurostar to Belgium before October 15. Je n'Aime pas la Culture is a retrospective of 20th-century history, highlighting cartoons. Where did you stumble across that? On the impressive What's On When site. I said I was interested in literature, and it came up with lots of suggestions - including the 2000 Oslo Ibsen Festival and the Saraswati festival in Indonesia, where books are given to the goddess to be blessed. I've already booked a week in St Lucia. Searching by destination is possible too. What's On When is fantastically detailed: it can tell you when the autumn equinox at Chichen Itza takes place, the best place to see the next meteor shower or the date of the White Nights party in St Petersburg. Nothing to criticise at all? I did wonder why an ad for the Reader's Digest Guide to Vitamins and Minerals kept popping up in the listings, but the site has to make money somehow. But few mainstream guides would tell you to visit London's Smithfield market - let alone what to look for when you're there.",

      "body": "<p>I suspect that, at heart, novelists - except for the lucky few whose lives seem to be permanent vacations - never really take holidays. Even in our sleep we invent characters; and we loathe beaches because the sand gets into our computers. </p> <p>Occasionally we submit to being dragged off to exotic hotels by long-suffering partners, but after one day of alleged relaxation our fingers start to itch. We sit seemingly half-asleep on deckchairs, while secretly studying every passing face and inventing extraordinary, clandestine and improbable lives for them. </p> <p>At least that's how it seems at times. More likely it's simply the fact of escaping from day-to-day pressures that allows the most unlikely of ideas to enter our heads in hotels, be dismissed out of hand and yet still linger there long enough for us, months later, to eventually take the first tentative steps to invent a world to contain them. </p> <p>Not that all hotels are the same. City hotels, by their nature, are transient stopovers, impersonal places that guests shoot through and forget. A novelist published in several languages spends part of their life being shunted around such places, with nothing to distinguish them in their memory except the different shapes of tiny bottles of stolen shower gel found stowed away in their bag months later. </p> <p>You give a reading at eight o'clock in the evening, return to your hotel at 10, retire at midnight, lie awake listening to the clanging lift-shaft, the wheezing central-heating, the chorus of televisions and the guest next door who sounds like he's trying to share a shower with a highly strung Irish wolfhound. Then, around 2am you turn the light back on and grievously assault the mini-bar. </p> <p>This type of hotel fascinated me enough to devise Finbar's Hotel and Ladies Night at Finbar's Hotel and cajole/bully a legion of Irish writers to lend their imaginations to a collective writing experience in two different volumes. The bizarre events conjured by the writers in both books testify to the nature of city hotels. </p> <p>You might think my fascination with hotels would be sated by now, but a different, relaxing type of hotel experience has, over the past seven years, gradually crystallised in my mind into the apparently quiet family holiday at the heart of my new novel, Temptation. </p> <p>Without the introduction of the concrete block in 1902, not only would my annual holiday - along with generations of Irish families - be less interesting, but Temptation would never have been inspired and written. </p> <p>Although William J. Kelly applied in 1893 for a licence to build a hotel on Rosslare Strand in Wexford, all he initially constructed - in the then wildness of sand dunes - was a small wooden tea-rooms. Hardly enough to keep a growing family, which is why he also ran a brick-building enterprise, which traded successfully until the concrete block knocked the foundations out of his trade in 1902. A lesser man might have strapped a quantity of unsold bricks to his back and drowned himself. Instead Mr Kelly simply knocked down his wooden tea-rooms and used his unwanted bricks to build a proper hotel, therefore founding a legendary Irish hotel dynasty. </p> <p>The legend grew as his son, the keen photographer and bird-watcher, Nicholas, took over in the 1920s; to be succeeded in the 1950s by Billy and Breda Kelly (who awarded certificates in winter to anybody crazy enough to run straight from the sauna down into the icy waves); and who were, in turn, followed by Bill and Isabelle Kelly, who run it today. </p> <p>If this succession suggests a continuity, then the loyalty of guests compounds the sensation. Ending my first stay I thought the queue to pay was moving slowly until I discovered that most guests were not just paying their bill, but booking themselves in for the same week next year. </p> <p>Continuity fascinates a writer almost as much as change does, possibly because it can provide the medium to measure and compare change. Over the years as I returned to Kelly's Hotel I found myself becoming increasingly conscious of the changes in my own life since I was last there, from the time I had to eat my meals with one hand holding down a screaming child in a high-chair, to now when my children wander freely by themselves. </p> <p>These dichotomies and the sense of a life passing must be far more pronounced for people who have been returning there for 40 or 50 years. But each year, as I walked in its gardens or rambling corridors with its famous art collection, I felt that a novel was waiting to be set within its walls, until I was eventually seduced by the temptation to write it. </p> <p>In recent years there seems an unspoken competition among Irish novelists to further push back the bounds of shockability in Irish fiction. As somebody who helped to set the ball rolling with a government minister defecating on an Irish emigrant in a hotel bedroom in The Journey Home, I'm hardly blameless here, and I believe it to be invigorating that everything within the bounds of human experience should fall within the ambit of fiction. </p> <p>You see this curve in French film also to such an extent that you can virtually date most French films between 1965 and 1974 by their level of sexual explicitness. Yet one of the most interesting and erotic French films of this period is Claire's Knee, where the sole physical contact occurs when a man briefly touches the knee of the woman he is infatuated with. </p> <p>If the film Night on Earth inspired Finbar's Hotel, then Claire's Knee inspired Temptation. In my previous novels characters' lives were transformed by major, often brutal, political or social events. But in Temptation I wanted to explore the life of a seemingly happily married woman enjoying what seems on the surface to be a normal family holiday.

      "bodyText": "I suspect that, at heart, novelists - except for the lucky few whose lives seem to be permanent vacations - never really take holidays. Even in our sleep we invent characters; and we loathe beaches because the sand gets into our computers. Occasionally we submit to being dragged off to exotic hotels by long-suffering partners, but after one day of alleged relaxation our fingers start to itch. We sit seemingly half-asleep on deckchairs, while secretly studying every passing face and inventing extraordinary, clandestine and improbable lives for them. At least that's how it seems at times. More likely it's simply the fact of escaping from day-to-day pressures that allows the most unlikely of ideas to enter our heads in hotels, be dismissed out of hand and yet still linger there long enough for us, months later, to eventually take the first tentative steps to invent a world to contain them. Not that all hotels are the same. City hotels, by their nature, are transient stopovers, impersonal places that guests shoot through and forget. A novelist published in several languages spends part of their life being shunted around such places, with nothing to distinguish them in their memory except the different shapes of tiny bottles of stolen shower gel found stowed away in their bag months later. You give a reading at eight o'clock in the evening, return to your hotel at 10, retire at midnight, lie awake listening to the clanging lift-shaft, the wheezing central-heating, the chorus of televisions and the guest next door who sounds like he's trying to share a shower with a highly strung Irish wolfhound. Then, around 2am you turn the light back on and grievously assault the mini-bar. This type of hotel fascinated me enough to devise Finbar's Hotel and Ladies Night at Finbar's Hotel and cajole/bully a legion of Irish writers to lend their imaginations to a collective writing experience in two different volumes. The bizarre events conjured by the writers in both books testify to the nature of city hotels. You might think my fascination with hotels would be sated by now, but a different, relaxing type of hotel experience has, over the past seven years, gradually crystallised in my mind into the apparently quiet family holiday at the heart of my new novel, Temptation. Without the introduction of the concrete block in 1902, not only would my annual holiday - along with generations of Irish families - be less interesting, but Temptation would never have been inspired and written. Although William J. Kelly applied in 1893 for a licence to build a hotel on Rosslare Strand in Wexford, all he initially constructed - in the then wildness of sand dunes - was a small wooden tea-rooms. Hardly enough to keep a growing family, which is why he also ran a brick-building enterprise, which traded successfully until the concrete block knocked the foundations out of his trade in 1902. A lesser man might have strapped a quantity of unsold bricks to his back and drowned himself. Instead Mr Kelly simply knocked down his wooden tea-rooms and used his unwanted bricks to build a proper hotel, therefore founding a legendary Irish hotel dynasty. The legend grew as his son, the keen photographer and bird-watcher, Nicholas, took over in the 1920s; to be succeeded in the 1950s by Billy and Breda Kelly (who awarded certificates in winter to anybody crazy enough to run straight from the sauna down into the icy waves); and who were, in turn, followed by Bill and Isabelle Kelly, who run it today. If this succession suggests a continuity, then the loyalty of guests compounds the sensation. Ending my first stay I thought the queue to pay was moving slowly until I discovered that most guests were not just paying their bill, but booking themselves in for the same week next year. Continuity fascinates a writer almost as much as change does, possibly because it can provide the medium to measure and compare change. Over the years as I returned to Kelly's Hotel I found myself becoming increasingly conscious of the changes in my own life since I was last there, from the time I had to eat my meals with one hand holding down a screaming child in a high-chair, to now when my children wander freely by themselves. These dichotomies and the sense of a life passing must be far more pronounced for people who have been returning there for 40 or 50 years. But each year, as I walked in its gardens or rambling corridors with its famous art collection, I felt that a novel was waiting to be set within its walls, until I was eventually seduced by the temptation to write it. In recent years there seems an unspoken competition among Irish novelists to further push back the bounds of shockability in Irish fiction. As somebody who helped to set the ball rolling with a government minister defecating on an Irish emigrant in a hotel bedroom in The Journey Home, I'm hardly blameless here, and I believe it to be invigorating that everything within the bounds of human experience should fall within the ambit of fiction. You see this curve in French film also to such an extent that you can virtually date most French films between 1965 and 1974 by their level of sexual explicitness. Yet one of the most interesting and erotic French films of this period is Claire's Knee, where the sole physical contact occurs when a man briefly touches the knee of the woman he is infatuated with. If the film Night on Earth inspired Finbar's Hotel, then Claire's Knee inspired Temptation. In my previous novels characters' lives were transformed by major, often brutal, political or social events. But in Temptation I wanted to explore the life of a seemingly happily married woman enjoying what seems on the surface to be a normal family holiday. Yet by the end of it, without even her husband knowing, her life is utterly transformed. I began the novel proper the week after my 40th birthday when I realised that lots of events, which still seemed vivid and immediate to me, had now in fact occurred 20 years before. It was a sobering thought and one which haunts the character Alison Gill, who has returned to the same hotel with her husband and children every year, unaware that the man she almost married 20 years before has done the same with his family during a different week. Following the death of his wife and children in a crash he returns for one last visit, accidentally stumbling into Alison just as her husband is forced to return home on business, abandoning her there with the children. I wanted them to meet when she was feeling most insecure, so that she found herself being forced to sit in judgment on her own life: her present-day reality versus her image at 18, which he had carried in his heart. Perhaps only somebody who has not seen us for 20 years can truly judge how our body and spirit has withstood two decades of living. In Alison, I wanted to explore how a mother feels trapped by always having to curb her own needs to mind her children; how somebody can love their husband but became aware of the phantom pain of unfinished business; how the touch you always ache for is the one you've never known. Last year I locked myself away during daylight hours on a remote lighthouse to complete Temptation. Seagulls were my company, a seal sunbathing on a rock below my window at low tide, the occasional stray fisherman.

      "body": "<p>This is a fantastic place to shop. Many items are available at a fraction of what they would cost in the UK. While haggling in India can be stressful, there are several government emporia that sell goods from across the subcontinent at a fixed price. And there are also some excellent restaurants and swimming pools where you can relax afterwards.</p> <p>Bear in mind that Delhi is extremely hot in the summer months (May-July), though the monsoon, which has just arrived, brings some relief.</p> <p>Probably the top place to shop is Fabindia in Greater Kailash (646 5497), which exports much of its stock to the Conran Shop. Fabindia sells cool and classically-tailored Indian clothing, as well as some household goods. Prices are terrific: a pure silk dress with trousers costs \u00a322, a striped cotton dressing gown \u00a35, a man's silk shirt \u00a311, cotton print dress \u00a35.50, and scarf \u00a31.50. You can buy carpets here, too. A handwoven cotton carpet will set you back \u00a320-\u00a345, while you can pick up an orange wool carpet for a mere \u00a312.</p> <p>Over in Connaught Place, the modern hub of New Delhi, is the Central Cottage Industries Emporium (332 0439), a rambling six-storey government shop where you can buy anything from a 12ft ornamental elephant god to a packet of Darjeeling tea. Prices are clearly displayed and fixed. This is a good place to buy gifts for friends at home. You can pick up a pure pashmina shawl for \u00a3150, while a pashmina/silk mix costs \u00a350. There is a jewellery section (ornamental earrings \u00a32.50, chunky silver necklace \u00a330-\u00a350), as well as a floor full of children's toys (shiny two-inch elephant 60p). The emporium will ship purchases home for you: up to 20kg by sea costs around \u00a315.</p> <p>Nearby are several other state emporia: the Jammu and Kashmir Emporium has good carpets and shawls. Over at Connaught Circus, the government-run Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan (336 0902) offers comfortable kurta pyjamas (\u00a33) and Nehru jackets (\u00a35) made from khadi, the homespun cloth promoted by Gandhi (whose garlanded portrait adorns the entrance). The United Coffee Shop five minutes' walk away is a pleasant air-conditioned refuge: it serves espresso, as well as Indian and continental food.</p> <p>Over at Sarojini Market near Chanakyapuri, Delhi's diplomatic quarter, there is a range of shops where you can buy cheap high-street label clothes (eg baby Gap top 50p, dress \u00a32). The more up-market Santushti Shopping Complex a short cab ride away also sells silks and pashminas as well as jewellery. Its Basil and Thyme restaurant is a favourite hang-out of Delhi's political elite and serves good risotto and pasta. Three minutes away is the state-run Hotel Samrat, where non-residents can take a dip in the uncrowded pool for \u00a32.80. There is a children's pool here too.</p> <p>For the classically chaotic Indian shopping experience, head for the warren of bazaars near the Red Fort in Old Delhi. You can buy anything here from car parts to carpets. Be prepared to haggle. By contrast Dilli Haat, in south west Delhi, is a peaceful village-style craft market where you can sample food from all over India at open-air stalls. India is also a very good source of cheap books. One of the city's best bookshops is Bahri and Sons (469 4610) in Khan market, a central shopping alley popular with expats.</p> <p>BA flies direct from London to Delhi from \u00a3595, <a href=\"http://www.airindia.com\">Air India</a> (020-7495 7950) flies the same route for \u00a3939 inclu tax, and Virgin from \u00a3580 including tax. Direct flights between India and the UK are almost always full and it is advisable to book well in advance.</p>",

Over in Connaught Place, the modern hub of New Delhi, is the Central Cottage Industries Emporium (332 0439), a rambling six-storey government shop where you can buy anything from a 12ft ornamental elephant god to a packet of Darjeeling tea. Prices are clearly displayed and fixed. This is a good place to buy gifts for friends at home. You can pick up a pure pashmina shawl for \u00a3150, while a pashmina/silk mix costs \u00a350. There is a jewellery section (ornamental earrings \u00a32.50, chunky silver necklace \u00a330-\u00a350), as well as a floor full of children's toys (shiny two-inch elephant 60p). The emporium will ship purchases home for you: up to 20kg by sea costs around \u00a315. Nearby are several other state emporia: the Jammu and Kashmir Emporium has good carpets and shawls. Over at Connaught Circus, the government-run Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan (336 0902) offers comfortable kurta pyjamas (\u00a33) and Nehru jackets (\u00a35) made from khadi, the homespun cloth promoted by Gandhi (whose garlanded portrait adorns the entrance). The United Coffee Shop five minutes' walk away is a pleasant air-conditioned refuge: it serves espresso, as well as Indian and continental food. Over at Sarojini Market near Chanakyapuri, Delhi's diplomatic quarter, there is a range of shops where you can buy cheap high-street label clothes (eg baby Gap top 50p, dress \u00a32). The more up-market Santushti Shopping Complex a short cab ride away also sells silks and pashminas as well as jewellery. Its Basil and Thyme restaurant is a favourite hang-out of Delhi's political elite and serves good risotto and pasta. Three minutes away is the state-run Hotel Samrat, where non-residents can take a dip in the uncrowded pool for \u00a32.80. There is a children's pool here too. For the classically chaotic Indian shopping experience, head for the warren of bazaars near the Red Fort in Old Delhi. You can buy anything here from car parts to carpets. Be prepared to haggle. By contrast Dilli Haat, in south west Delhi, is a peaceful village-style craft market where you can sample food from all over India at open-air stalls. India is also a very good source of cheap books. One of the city's best bookshops is Bahri and Sons (469 4610) in Khan market, a central shopping alley popular with expats. BA flies direct from London to Delhi from \u00a3595, Air India (020-7495 7950) flies the same route for \u00a3939 inclu tax, and Virgin from \u00a3580 including tax. Direct flights between India and the UK are almost always full and it is advisable to book well in advance.",

Many have been run by the same family for generations and the objects on show - some too precious to sell - make them like museums run by commercial curators. Such shops are usually worth visiting even if you buy nothing at all. Unlike the anonymous morgues of modern retail chains, they are often alive with incident and interesting characters. </p> <p>And by shopping at the specialist, you are keeping alive a tradition of good service and expertise that that survives in the face of mass-production. </p> <p><strong> Tamburini </strong></p> <p> <strong> Location: </strong> in the city centre - Via Caprarie 1, 40124 Bolgona. <br> <strong> Tel: </strong> (00 39) 051 234726. <br> <strong> Fax: </strong> (00 39) 051 232226. <br> <strong> Web: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.tamburini.com\">www.tamburini.com</a> <br><strong> Open: </strong> Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday 9am-7pm, Tuesday and Thursday 9am-2.30pm. <br><strong> Specialities: </strong> Regional food, particularly pasta, cured meats and cheese. <br><strong> Sample prices: </strong> 12,000 lire (\u00a34) for a bottle of Tamburini's prosecco; 16,000 lire (\u00a35.30) for 500g gnocchi with porcini; 40,000 lire (\u00a313.50) for a 2kg mortadella. </p> <p>Tamburini's is a spectacular deli in a city famous for its sensuous appetite. The smell of the wood-fired rotisserie pulls you off the street into a long, marble-floored room, where hundreds of dishes are prepared daily. One counter is a white expanse of cheese, another a wall of cured meats.

      "bodyText": "Specialist shops are worth a detour for interesting presents and self-indulgence, but they also reveal much about the quirky, living culture of a city. You have no idea of the depth and breadth of goods on offer until you enter the door of the expert. Many have been run by the same family for generations and the objects on show - some too precious to sell - make them like museums run by commercial curators. Such shops are usually worth visiting even if you buy nothing at all. Unlike the anonymous morgues of modern retail chains, they are often alive with incident and interesting characters. And by shopping at the specialist, you are keeping alive a tradition of good service and expertise that that survives in the face of mass-production. Tamburini Location: in the city centre - Via Caprarie 1, 40124 Bolgona. Tel: (00 39) 051 234726. Fax: (00 39) 051 232226.

Tamburini's is a spectacular deli in a city famous for its sensuous appetite. The smell of the wood-fired rotisserie pulls you off the street into a long, marble-floored room, where hundreds of dishes are prepared daily. One counter is a white expanse of cheese, another a wall of cured meats. You can take the food away for picnics and presents, or eat at the self-service restaurant.

      "body": "<p>When Catharine Hartley was training to pull her sledge to the South Pole, she would harness herself to an old tractor tyre and drag it up Cross Dyke, a ridge on the South Downs with exhilarating views across the meandering channels and inlets of Chichester Harbour. </p> <p>But when she returned from her exhausting 61-day trip, the walk she took to reflect on the experience and think about the future was more private and secluded: down a lane from her home village of Chidham, and across fields to a jetty beside one of those inlets. </p> <p>She'd been there on the eve of her departure as well, and dozens of other times when she wanted to escape and take stock of her life: as a child she also took friends down there to go mudlarking at low tide, returning to be hosed down on the lawn by a furious mother. </p> <p>\"The place is very special for me, like an old friend, because it's got a lot of emotional history,\" she says. \"I'd go there if I was feeling miserable or wanted to contemplate what to do about problems with boyfriends or whatever. For 30 years I've been doing there to think about things.\" </p> <p>The jetty has a fine view across the channel to Bosham, one of southern England's most beautiful villages, with its Saxon church and rich history: it was here that King Canute is said to have ordered the tide to recede, and the village also features on the Bayeux Tapestry. </p> <p>Hartley once waded through the mud across to Bosham at low tide, but usually her walk continues a cou ple of miles down the coast to the hamlet of Cobnor, where she used to keep a small dinghy for sailing around the islands and sandbars, picnicing and sunbathing. </p> <p>The path goes past fields of potatoes and cabbages and barley, with seabirds hanging on the wind and small boats riding or fighting the tides. </p> <p>\"It's incredibly peaceful, and it's wonderful when you've just come back from London or from travelling because it's familiar and safe and normal,\" she says. </p> <p>\"I would always go by myself, because I'd hate to take someone else who was bored by it or failed to appreciate it. It's something I don't want to share. I rarely meet other people, and when I do they tend to be other locals, so it's nice to stop and pass the time of day.\" </p> <p>But Chidham by itself would never be enough: Hartley, now a location man ager for BBC TV, used to tour the country with theatre groups and would walk by herself for hours in the moors and dales. She now goes rock climbing too, but says she never takes risks. </p> <p>She suffered from being bad at sport at school and has loathed any competitive activity ever since. Instead she's discovered that she likes confronting hardship: \"I really enjoy going on walks when it's filthy, miserable weather , when its pouring with rain and you're struggling against the wind. </p> <p>\"I've been on some horren dous walks in Scotland, but the feeling at the end is absolutely fantastic, when you get back and sit by the fire. </p> <p>\"I think I must enjoy a struggle, but I find it so hard to explain why. Perhaps it is because I love putting my body through something difficult and gruelling, and testing my mental strength as well. </p> <p>\"I think it makes me feel alive. For many years I just plodded along and I hardly even felt awake, but the kind of thing I'm talking about really opens up your senses and makes you feel you really exist.\"</p> <p><strong>Antarctic walker</strong></p> <p>Catherine Hartley reached her mid-twenties feeling that her life was going nowhere. \"I felt I had failed educationally and was just bumbling along, but I desperately wanted to succeed at something without knowing what it was,\" she says. </p> <p>\"So I gave up work and went travelling for two years to sort myself out, and I discovered that I had this phenomenal thirst for adventure.

      "bodyText": "When Catharine Hartley was training to pull her sledge to the South Pole, she would harness herself to an old tractor tyre and drag it up Cross Dyke, a ridge on the South Downs with exhilarating views across the meandering channels and inlets of Chichester Harbour. But when she returned from her exhausting 61-day trip, the walk she took to reflect on the experience and think about the future was more private and secluded: down a lane from her home village of Chidham, and across fields to a jetty beside one of those inlets. She'd been there on the eve of her departure as well, and dozens of other times when she wanted to escape and take stock of her life: as a child she also took friends down there to go mudlarking at low tide, returning to be hosed down on the lawn by a furious mother. \"The place is very special for me, like an old friend, because it's got a lot of emotional history,\" she says. \"I'd go there if I was feeling miserable or wanted to contemplate what to do about problems with boyfriends or whatever. For 30 years I've been doing there to think about things.\" The jetty has a fine view across the channel to Bosham, one of southern England's most beautiful villages, with its Saxon church and rich history: it was here that King Canute is said to have ordered the tide to recede, and the village also features on the Bayeux Tapestry. Hartley once waded through the mud across to Bosham at low tide, but usually her walk continues a cou ple of miles down the coast to the hamlet of Cobnor, where she used to keep a small dinghy for sailing around the islands and sandbars, picnicing and sunbathing. The path goes past fields of potatoes and cabbages and barley, with seabirds hanging on the wind and small boats riding or fighting the tides. \"It's incredibly peaceful, and it's wonderful when you've just come back from London or from travelling because it's familiar and safe and normal,\" she says. \"I would always go by myself, because I'd hate to take someone else who was bored by it or failed to appreciate it. It's something I don't want to share. I rarely meet other people, and when I do they tend to be other locals, so it's nice to stop and pass the time of day.\" But Chidham by itself would never be enough: Hartley, now a location man ager for BBC TV, used to tour the country with theatre groups and would walk by herself for hours in the moors and dales. She now goes rock climbing too, but says she never takes risks. She suffered from being bad at sport at school and has loathed any competitive activity ever since. Instead she's discovered that she likes confronting hardship: \"I really enjoy going on walks when it's filthy, miserable weather , when its pouring with rain and you're struggling against the wind. \"I've been on some horren dous walks in Scotland, but the feeling at the end is absolutely fantastic, when you get back and sit by the fire. \"I think I must enjoy a struggle, but I find it so hard to explain why. Perhaps it is because I love putting my body through something difficult and gruelling, and testing my mental strength as well. \"I think it makes me feel alive. For many years I just plodded along and I hardly even felt awake, but the kind of thing I'm talking about really opens up your senses and makes you feel you really exist.\" Antarctic walker Catherine Hartley reached her mid-twenties feeling that her life was going nowhere. \"I felt I had failed educationally and was just bumbling along, but I desperately wanted to succeed at something without knowing what it was,\" she says. \"So I gave up work and went travelling for two years to sort myself out, and I discovered that I had this phenomenal thirst for adventure. I just yearned to go where no one else went, and when I got back I realised this was where I'd make my mark.\" Then she started thinking and reading about the polar regions and discovered that none of the half-dozen women who'd walked to the South Pole were British. \"I decided that one day, the first British woman would be me,\" she says. After years of planning, training and struggling to raise \u00a330,000, she finally shared the achievement in January this year with Fiona Thornewill from Nottinghamshire. They travelled in a group which included Fiona's husband Mike, four other men and two experienced polar guides. Shortly afterwards, five other British women completed the journey without guides. \"The journey was hideous, an enormous struggle, going through one pain barrier after another,\" says Hartley. \"I was the weakest of the group so I had to deal with the demoralisation of trying to keep up, and struggling every inch of the way. \"When I came back I said, never again.

      "body": "<p>There are very few things that give as big an insight into the perverted juxtaposition of the terms British and tourist as the Castaway 2000 telly show. It's not an obvious insight, admittedly, but it is definitely there. </p> <p>Since the group of volunteers were willingly wrenched from their comfy homes and dropped on Hebridean Taransay, the number of tourists flocking to Scottish islands has spiralled. The encouragement for visitors, you will remember, is not of the sort generally found in glossy brochures. </p> <p>Cold. Gale force winds. Horizontal rain. Cold. Snow. More cold. A bit more rain. Who needs Majorca when you can have all that? </p> <p>But then, then there was the inescapable fact of the island's beauty. While the Scottish islands are never going to offer guaranteed sunshine, they do have beauty and romance in abundance. </p> <p>On Mull, you can drive for hours on single-track roads and pass barely a soul. As the landscape changes from undulating to mountainous, from lush to craggy at every turn of the wheel, the stresses of urban life melt away. </p> <p>There is something about disembarking from a ferry onto a barely inhabited island that makes real life seem so very far away. There's things to do to fill the day time hours - visit Iona, the root of British Christianity. But it's the evenings that make things special. </p> <p>Lie in a bath in a hotel so quiet - like Killiechronan - that it is possible to hear the tick of the downstairs clock. Eat locally landed seafood and drink too much wine, before walking it off along the water's edge. </p> <p>On Lewis and Harris, you can stroll on white sandy beaches and wonder at the alien character of Calvinist life. Old women will stand at bus stops, decked in their best hats and lace gloves, waiting for the bus to take them to the minister, who will tell them they are damned for ever. </p> <p>Around the corner, will lie ancient ruins and hills begging to be walked upon. On them, you will encounter not a soul. On Sunday, nothing happens at all. </p> <p>But if this sounds too remote, too isolated, then islands such as Skye can offer more, if it is needed, than perfect tranquillity. Beneath the imposing dominance of the Cuillin hills nestle decent restaurants, good hotels and nightlife consisting of more than just ceilidhs. </p> <p> <strong> How to get there:</strong> Various companies offer package tours, but doing it independently is a better idea. <a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">EasyJet</a> (0870 6 000 000) flies from Luton to Inverness from \u00a395 inclu tax, BA (0845 7733377) flies from Gatwick for \u00a3120 inclu tax. From Inverness it is a three-hour, but very scenic, drive to Kyle, then it's across the recently constructed bridge to Skye (\u00a311.30 return). </p> <p>If getting there by boat is an essential, it's probably best to fly to Glasgow. From there, it's a four-hour drive to Mallaig through some of the most spectacular scenery in Scotland. The little port has fantastic seafood - though much of it is merely landed here before being flown on to Paris - so it would make a handy stop-over. </p> <p>The Mallaig-Armadale ferry takes around 30 mins and costs from \u00a326 per car plus \u00a34.60 per adult, children half price. Details from the site of the Caledonian MacBrayne, or <a href=\"http://www.calmac.co.uk\">CalMac</a>, ferry company or reservations (08705 650000). </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> If money is no object, the Three Chimneys and the House Over-By, near Dunvegan, (01470 511258), is the only place to stay. It is tiny - just six rooms - and utterly luxurious at \u00a3140 B&amp;B for a double. Food in the restaurant is by far and away the best on the island. Similarly expensive at \u00a3100 B&amp;B for a double, <a href=\"http://www.kinloch-lodge.co.uk\">Kinloch Lodge</a>, on the Sleat peninsula, (01471 833333), is the ancestral home of Lord and Lady Macdonald. In her spare time, Lady Claire writes cookbooks, so the food is as you would expect - but there's no choice. </p> <p>The isolated <a href=\"http://www.flodigarry.co.uk\">Flodigarry</a>, near Staffin, manages to be Scottish without too much tartanalia. The rooms are creaky but tasteful and the staff are extremely attentive. \u00a3110 B&amp;B overnight, \u00a390 if staying more than one night (01470 552203). </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat:</strong> The Three Chimneys is the best restaurant on the island. A cheaper alternative is the Lochbay Seafood, near Dunvegan, (01470 592235). It looks more like someone's home than a restaurant, but the food is good and unpretentious - nearly all of it is landed locally. </p> <p>In Portree, the tourist centre of the island, the best place to eat is the Harbour View. Not sophisticated, but fresh and, yet again, seafood. </p> <p> <strong> What to do:</strong> The Cuillins may look inviting, but they are difficult and best left to experienced hill walkers. The local tourist office in Portree (01478 612137) can provide guides to easier walks. </p> <p>Dunvegan castle offers romantic history in a superb setting, but at the height of the summer months it can get ridiculously busy. The grave of Flora Macdonald, Kilmuir, who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie escape the English, is worth a visit. </p> <p>And if the copious coach tourists all get too much for you on Skye, it's easy to escape to Raasay, a haunting little island accessed by a short ferry crossing from Sconser. </p> <p> <strong> How to get there:</strong> The best start is probably a flight to Glasgow on either British Airways from \u00a3108 return inclu tax. <a href=\"http://www.britishmidland.co.uk\">British Midland</a> (0870 6070555) from \u00a369.20 return inclu tax, EasyJet from \u00a355 return inclu tax. <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> (0870 1569569), from \u00a347.20 return inclu tax flies to Prestwick. From Glasgow it's a (very pretty) two-hour car ride to Oban. EasyJet offer car-hire deals from Glasgow from \u00a39 a day. CalMac cross from Oban to Craignure, on Mull, up to eight times a day from \u00a341 per car plus \u00a35.90 per adult, children half-price. </p> <p>A car is essential for these islands, but if you're planning to stay on Iona - a five-minute ferry ride from Fionnphort - you'll have to leave it on Mull because only locals are allowed cars on Iona. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> Unless you're looking for a spiritual retreat, Mull is the better place. On Iona, however, the Argyll Hotel (01681 700334) has two cosy rooms and reasonable food, \u00a386 B&amp;B per night for a double. The best place to stay on Mull is undoubtedly the tranquil Killiechronan House (01680 300403, from \u00a3130 B&amp;B per night for a double). It has only six rooms and the emphasis is definitely on comfort. More central is the imposing Western Isles Hotel (01688 302012, from \u00a390 B&amp;B for a double). Perched above the main town of Tobermory, it's the place to stay if you're looking for a bit of nightlife. The Tiroran House (01681 705232) is a good getaway. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat:</strong> The best food on the island is in the hotels - especially Killiechronan. But the Calgary Farmhouse (01688 400256, three-course meal \u00a317-18 exclu wine ), next to the white sandy beach, has good home cooking and seafood landed by friends of the family. In Tobermory, the Back Brae (01688 302422, three-course meal \u00a312.95 exclu wine ) also has good seafood ,as does the Anchorage (01688 302313, three-course meal \u00a320 exclu wine). It's not sophisticated, but don't let appearances put you off. </p> <p> <strong> What to do:</strong> If you're staying on Mull, then a trip to Iona is an essential. The best way is to combine it with a trip to Staffa - to see Fingal's cave, the inspiration for Mendelssohn's Hebridean overture, and the friendly colony of puffins. Gordon Grant Cruises (01681 700338) have morning and afternoon trips (to avoid the hordes on Iona, morning is usually best), price \u00a312.50 till the end of October when operations cease due to the winter weather </p> <p>There are plenty of walks round the island and the tourist board (01688 302182) can offer advice and maps. Calgary beach is great for soaking up any sun. The Mishnish, in Tobermory, is the best place for a drink. </p> <p>The Treshnish isles are home to loads of different birds and Gordon Grant can arrange trips. </p> <p>Finally, if you want to experience true castaway isolation, take the five minute ferry to Ulva. There are just over 20 inhabitants - and there is absolutely nothing to do but walk among the hills. </p> <p> <strong> How to get there:</strong> If you're planning just a short break, the best way to get to Lewis and Harris - it's one island - is by plane to Stornoway. BA operates flights from Glasgow under the British Regional Airlines flag for \u00a3107.70 return inclu tax; and from Inverness and Edinburgh under the flag of Logan Air for, respectively, \u00a380 and \u00a3111.10 return inclu tax. These flights can be booked on BA's reservations line (0845 7733377). The alternative to flying is to take a three-hour ferry from Ullapool to Stornoway. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> Lewis, be warned, is not the hotel capital of Scotland. The Park Guest House in uninspiring Stornoway (01851 702485) offers basic accommodation in comfy rooms for \u00a340 B&amp;B a night per double. A Stornoway alternative is the Royal Hotel (01851 702109, \u00a372 B&amp;B for a double per night). It's not luxurious, but it is good value. A little further out - but with far superior accommodation - is the Baile-na-Cille in Uig (01851 672242, from \u00a348 B&amp;B for a double per night). </p> <p>If island luxury is on the agenda, Harris makes a better choice than Lewis. For an awful lot less than a standard business hotel rate, you can stay in the gloriously isolated Ardvourlie Castle (01859 502307), \u00a3130 B&amp;B, \u00a3180 B&amp;B plus dinner for a double per night. It has great views over the loch, the food is good and the bathrooms are massive. There's also the Scarista House (01859 550238), \u00a3116 B&amp;B for a double per night) which has very good food. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat:</strong> The hotels listed above all have restaurants open to non-residents but you will have to book. On Lewis, the best restaurant is probably the Bonaventure (01851 672474, \u00a38.95 for three-courses without wine). It's a bit of a trek to get there, but the Franco-Scottish cooking makes it worth the effort. Tigh Mealros (01851 621333) is cheap at \u00a312-14 for three courses (no licence but you can bring your own wine), and a refreshing break from some of the Puritanism that stalks the island. </p> <p>On Harris, there is less choice and you're best bet is probably the hotels. </p> <p> <strong> What to do:</strong> Lewis does not give up its charms easily, but the tourist office in Stornoway (01851 701818) will point you in the right direction. The landscape is flat and boggy and, to many, very depressing but it has some of the best beaches and clearest waters in the Hebrides. There is some good surfing to be had - and Stornoway Surf and Sports (0851 705862) is the place to go for advice. For the less adventurous, the standing stones at Callanish are among the best preserved in Britain. The tea room isn't bad either. </p> <p>The more mountainous Harris has great beaches and fantastic walks. Details from the tourist office in Stornoway.

      "bodyText": "There are very few things that give as big an insight into the perverted juxtaposition of the terms British and tourist as the Castaway 2000 telly show. It's not an obvious insight, admittedly, but it is definitely there. Since the group of volunteers were willingly wrenched from their comfy homes and dropped on Hebridean Taransay, the number of tourists flocking to Scottish islands has spiralled. The encouragement for visitors, you will remember, is not of the sort generally found in glossy brochures. Cold. Gale force winds. Horizontal rain. Cold. Snow. More cold. A bit more rain. Who needs Majorca when you can have all that? But then, then there was the inescapable fact of the island's beauty. While the Scottish islands are never going to offer guaranteed sunshine, they do have beauty and romance in abundance. On Mull, you can drive for hours on single-track roads and pass barely a soul. As the landscape changes from undulating to mountainous, from lush to craggy at every turn of the wheel, the stresses of urban life melt away. There is something about disembarking from a ferry onto a barely inhabited island that makes real life seem so very far away. There's things to do to fill the day time hours - visit Iona, the root of British Christianity. But it's the evenings that make things special. Lie in a bath in a hotel so quiet - like Killiechronan - that it is possible to hear the tick of the downstairs clock. Eat locally landed seafood and drink too much wine, before walking it off along the water's edge. On Lewis and Harris, you can stroll on white sandy beaches and wonder at the alien character of Calvinist life. Old women will stand at bus stops, decked in their best hats and lace gloves, waiting for the bus to take them to the minister, who will tell them they are damned for ever. Around the corner, will lie ancient ruins and hills begging to be walked upon. On them, you will encounter not a soul. On Sunday, nothing happens at all. But if this sounds too remote, too isolated, then islands such as Skye can offer more, if it is needed, than perfect tranquillity. Beneath the imposing dominance of the Cuillin hills nestle decent restaurants, good hotels and nightlife consisting of more than just ceilidhs. How to get there: Various companies offer package tours, but doing it independently is a better idea. EasyJet (0870 6 000 000) flies from Luton to Inverness from \u00a395 inclu tax, BA (0845 7733377) flies from Gatwick for \u00a3120 inclu tax. From Inverness it is a three-hour, but very scenic, drive to Kyle, then it's across the recently constructed bridge to Skye (\u00a311.30 return). If getting there by boat is an essential, it's probably best to fly to Glasgow. From there, it's a four-hour drive to Mallaig through some of the most spectacular scenery in Scotland. The little port has fantastic seafood - though much of it is merely landed here before being flown on to Paris - so it would make a handy stop-over. The Mallaig-Armadale ferry takes around 30 mins and costs from \u00a326 per car plus \u00a34.60 per adult, children half price. Details from the site of the Caledonian MacBrayne, or CalMac, ferry company or reservations (08705 650000). Where to stay: If money is no object, the Three Chimneys and the House Over-By, near Dunvegan, (01470 511258), is the only place to stay. It is tiny - just six rooms - and utterly luxurious at \u00a3140 B&amp;B for a double. Food in the restaurant is by far and away the best on the island. Similarly expensive at \u00a3100 B&amp;B for a double, Kinloch Lodge, on the Sleat peninsula, (01471 833333), is the ancestral home of Lord and Lady Macdonald. In her spare time, Lady Claire writes cookbooks, so the food is as you would expect - but there's no choice. The isolated Flodigarry, near Staffin, manages to be Scottish without too much tartanalia. The rooms are creaky but tasteful and the staff are extremely attentive. \u00a3110 B&amp;B overnight, \u00a390 if staying more than one night (01470 552203). Where to eat: The Three Chimneys is the best restaurant on the island. A cheaper alternative is the Lochbay Seafood, near Dunvegan, (01470 592235). It looks more like someone's home than a restaurant, but the food is good and unpretentious - nearly all of it is landed locally. In Portree, the tourist centre of the island, the best place to eat is the Harbour View. Not sophisticated, but fresh and, yet again, seafood. What to do: The Cuillins may look inviting, but they are difficult and best left to experienced hill walkers. The local tourist office in Portree (01478 612137) can provide guides to easier walks. Dunvegan castle offers romantic history in a superb setting, but at the height of the summer months it can get ridiculously busy. The grave of Flora Macdonald, Kilmuir, who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie escape the English, is worth a visit. And if the copious coach tourists all get too much for you on Skye, it's easy to escape to Raasay, a haunting little island accessed by a short ferry crossing from Sconser. How to get there: The best start is probably a flight to Glasgow on either British Airways from \u00a3108 return inclu tax. British Midland (0870 6070555) from \u00a369.20 return inclu tax, EasyJet from \u00a355 return inclu tax. Ryanair (0870 1569569), from \u00a347.20 return inclu tax flies to Prestwick. From Glasgow it's a (very pretty) two-hour car ride to Oban. EasyJet offer car-hire deals from Glasgow from \u00a39 a day. CalMac cross from Oban to Craignure, on Mull, up to eight times a day from \u00a341 per car plus \u00a35.90 per adult, children half-price. A car is essential for these islands, but if you're planning to stay on Iona - a five-minute ferry ride from Fionnphort - you'll have to leave it on Mull because only locals are allowed cars on Iona. Where to stay: Unless you're looking for a spiritual retreat, Mull is the better place. On Iona, however, the Argyll Hotel (01681 700334) has two cosy rooms and reasonable food, \u00a386 B&amp;B per night for a double. The best place to stay on Mull is undoubtedly the tranquil Killiechronan House (01680 300403, from \u00a3130 B&amp;B per night for a double). It has only six rooms and the emphasis is definitely on comfort. More central is the imposing Western Isles Hotel (01688 302012, from \u00a390 B&amp;B for a double). Perched above the main town of Tobermory, it's the place to stay if you're looking for a bit of nightlife. The Tiroran House (01681 705232) is a good getaway. Where to eat: The best food on the island is in the hotels - especially Killiechronan. But the Calgary Farmhouse (01688 400256, three-course meal \u00a317-18 exclu wine ), next to the white sandy beach, has good home cooking and seafood landed by friends of the family. In Tobermory, the Back Brae (01688 302422, three-course meal \u00a312.95 exclu wine ) also has good seafood ,as does the Anchorage (01688 302313, three-course meal \u00a320 exclu wine). It's not sophisticated, but don't let appearances put you off. What to do: If you're staying on Mull, then a trip to Iona is an essential. The best way is to combine it with a trip to Staffa - to see Fingal's cave, the inspiration for Mendelssohn's Hebridean overture, and the friendly colony of puffins. Gordon Grant Cruises (01681 700338) have morning and afternoon trips (to avoid the hordes on Iona, morning is usually best), price \u00a312.50 till the end of October when operations cease due to the winter weather There are plenty of walks round the island and the tourist board (01688 302182) can offer advice and maps. Calgary beach is great for soaking up any sun. The Mishnish, in Tobermory, is the best place for a drink. The Treshnish isles are home to loads of different birds and Gordon Grant can arrange trips. Finally, if you want to experience true castaway isolation, take the five minute ferry to Ulva. There are just over 20 inhabitants - and there is absolutely nothing to do but walk among the hills. How to get there: If you're planning just a short break, the best way to get to Lewis and Harris - it's one island - is by plane to Stornoway. BA operates flights from Glasgow under the British Regional Airlines flag for \u00a3107.70 return inclu tax; and from Inverness and Edinburgh under the flag of Logan Air for, respectively, \u00a380 and \u00a3111.10 return inclu tax. These flights can be booked on BA's reservations line (0845 7733377). The alternative to flying is to take a three-hour ferry from Ullapool to Stornoway. Where to stay: Lewis, be warned, is not the hotel capital of Scotland. The Park Guest House in uninspiring Stornoway (01851 702485) offers basic accommodation in comfy rooms for \u00a340 B&amp;B a night per double. A Stornoway alternative is the Royal Hotel (01851 702109, \u00a372 B&amp;B for a double per night). It's not luxurious, but it is good value. A little further out - but with far superior accommodation - is the Baile-na-Cille in Uig (01851 672242, from \u00a348 B&amp;B for a double per night). If island luxury is on the agenda, Harris makes a better choice than Lewis. For an awful lot less than a standard business hotel rate, you can stay in the gloriously isolated Ardvourlie Castle (01859 502307), \u00a3130 B&amp;B, \u00a3180 B&amp;B plus dinner for a double per night. It has great views over the loch, the food is good and the bathrooms are massive. There's also the Scarista House (01859 550238), \u00a3116 B&amp;B for a double per night) which has very good food.

      "body": "<p>To take a break in Kiev is to savour what it must have been like to be a British tourist on the Continent in the days before air travel and cheap packages - you are as exotic to the city as it is to you. Foreign newspapers are few and far between, guidebooks are almost impossible to find, hotels thin on the ground. </p> <p>For all that, it is Europe. Your mobile works, there are cash machines, night clubs, and beer on tap. And it is possible to satisfy your yearning both for the flavour of the old Soviet Union - Lenin statues, Brezhnev-era design, headscarved babushkas driving clanky old trams - and for the gangsterish, hedonistic, sometimes intoxicating rush to capitalism that followed it. All this without the overwhelming pace and aggression of Moscow. </p> <p>Some will find Kiev's indifference to foreign tourists hard to take. It's not that the Ukrainians don't like tourists: it's just that they don't care whether you come or not. If the lack of facilities for independent travellers and the need for a visa doesn't put you off, Kiev offers rewards. Though now outside Russia, it is the birthplace of Orthodox Russia; founded as part of a Viking empire that stretched from the Dnieper to Greenland, it has survived Mongol invasion, Nazi occupation and Stalinist terror. </p> <p>The Kiev of steep cobbled streets, opera house, Tsarist-era university, churches and monasteries described in loving detail by Mikhail Bulgakov in his civil war novel The White Guard lives on alongside monuments of the Soviet era like the massive Constructivist dimensions of the curving main street, Kreshchatik, and the Republican Stadium, home of the city's football club. </p> <p>Kiev has a lesson for towns that have lost ancient monuments: if they don't exist, rebuild them. Demolished under Stalin's anti-religious campaign in the 1930s, St Michael's cathedral, one of the jewels of Kievan ecclesiastical architecture since the 12th century, has been reconstructed from scratch in two years. It's only a copy, but it is a very beautiful copy, burnished with gold inside and out, rich with icons and wedding cake-icing blue and white paint. Its resurrection has restored one of the best urban vistas in eastern Europe - the broad paved prospect stretching from an ancient survivor of Stalin's wrath, St Sophia's cathedral, past the rearing equestrian monument to the 17th-century Ukrainian leader Bohdan Khmelnitsky, to St Michael's and then sharplydown through wooded heights to the great river Dnieper. </p> <p>A lot of what wealth Ukraine - a country of 50m - has is trickling into this city of 3m. It shows in the foreign cars outnumbering the Ladas on the streets, in the burgeoning caf\u00e9 culture for which Kiev had a reputation even in Soviet days, and in the restoration, or at least repainting, of the magnificent Silver Age apartment blocks of the Pechersk and Old Kiev districts, dating from the late 19th and early 20th century, when the city was a wealthy, thriving European metropolis. </p> <p>In the evenings of their short, hot summers, the young Ukrainians - beautiful people in cheap clothes - promenade like Italians under the huge shaggy chest nut trees that line the streets. There can be few cities as wooded as Kiev. In autumn, the leaves fall away, revealing the grubby walls of the prefab concrete apartment blocks. But while the leaves are there, some streets are like forests, with glimpses through the branches of art-nouveau balconies, or the massive stone shoulders of a sculpted, buttressing Atlas, or a pair of gold highheeled slingbacks crossed under a caf\u00e9 table. </p> <p><strong> What to see and do</strong><br> </p> <p> The best way to see central Kiev is to take a stroll. Start at Bessarabska Square (closest metro: Ploshcha Lva Tolstoho), site of the central covered market, where among the fat cherries, bright scarlet radishes and slabs of pork fat, you can pick up a 100g jar of black caviar for a few quid. Quality's a bit of a gamble, and don't buy too many, or you might have trouble with Customs on the way out, but one or two should be okay. </p> <p>Walk up Taras Shevchenko Boulevard - one of Kiev's few remaining Lenin statues stands here - and, with the blood-red pillars of Kiev university on your left, take a right on to Volodymyrska Street. Passing the opera house, after a couple of blocks you reach the Golden Gate, a reconstruction of one of the gates in the once-mighty city walls which proved all too vulnerable to the Mongols when they attacked in 1216. Keep going along Volodymyrska and you get to St Sophia's, with its landmark blue and white bell tower. This is one of the most ancient complexes of buildings in eastern Christendom: part of it dates back to the 11th century. </p> <p>Pressing on past the statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Volodymyrska eventually ends with the sight of Rastrelli's knobbly baroque masterpiece, St Andrew's church, at the top of Andriyivsky Uzviz. This cobbled street winds steeply downhill towards the old port district of Podil. It's a pleasant place to eat or drink outdoors in summer, with beer gardens, restaurants and craft shops and stalls selling kitschy - mainly Russian - souvenirs.

      "bodyText": "To take a break in Kiev is to savour what it must have been like to be a British tourist on the Continent in the days before air travel and cheap packages - you are as exotic to the city as it is to you. Foreign newspapers are few and far between, guidebooks are almost impossible to find, hotels thin on the ground. For all that, it is Europe. Your mobile works, there are cash machines, night clubs, and beer on tap. And it is possible to satisfy your yearning both for the flavour of the old Soviet Union - Lenin statues, Brezhnev-era design, headscarved babushkas driving clanky old trams - and for the gangsterish, hedonistic, sometimes intoxicating rush to capitalism that followed it. All this without the overwhelming pace and aggression of Moscow. Some will find Kiev's indifference to foreign tourists hard to take. It's not that the Ukrainians don't like tourists: it's just that they don't care whether you come or not. If the lack of facilities for independent travellers and the need for a visa doesn't put you off, Kiev offers rewards. Though now outside Russia, it is the birthplace of Orthodox Russia; founded as part of a Viking empire that stretched from the Dnieper to Greenland, it has survived Mongol invasion, Nazi occupation and Stalinist terror. The Kiev of steep cobbled streets, opera house, Tsarist-era university, churches and monasteries described in loving detail by Mikhail Bulgakov in his civil war novel The White Guard lives on alongside monuments of the Soviet era like the massive Constructivist dimensions of the curving main street, Kreshchatik, and the Republican Stadium, home of the city's football club. Kiev has a lesson for towns that have lost ancient monuments: if they don't exist, rebuild them. Demolished under Stalin's anti-religious campaign in the 1930s, St Michael's cathedral, one of the jewels of Kievan ecclesiastical architecture since the 12th century, has been reconstructed from scratch in two years. It's only a copy, but it is a very beautiful copy, burnished with gold inside and out, rich with icons and wedding cake-icing blue and white paint. Its resurrection has restored one of the best urban vistas in eastern Europe - the broad paved prospect stretching from an ancient survivor of Stalin's wrath, St Sophia's cathedral, past the rearing equestrian monument to the 17th-century Ukrainian leader Bohdan Khmelnitsky, to St Michael's and then sharplydown through wooded heights to the great river Dnieper. A lot of what wealth Ukraine - a country of 50m - has is trickling into this city of 3m. It shows in the foreign cars outnumbering the Ladas on the streets, in the burgeoning caf\u00e9 culture for which Kiev had a reputation even in Soviet days, and in the restoration, or at least repainting, of the magnificent Silver Age apartment blocks of the Pechersk and Old Kiev districts, dating from the late 19th and early 20th century, when the city was a wealthy, thriving European metropolis. In the evenings of their short, hot summers, the young Ukrainians - beautiful people in cheap clothes - promenade like Italians under the huge shaggy chest nut trees that line the streets. There can be few cities as wooded as Kiev. In autumn, the leaves fall away, revealing the grubby walls of the prefab concrete apartment blocks. But while the leaves are there, some streets are like forests, with glimpses through the branches of art-nouveau balconies, or the massive stone shoulders of a sculpted, buttressing Atlas, or a pair of gold highheeled slingbacks crossed under a caf\u00e9 table. What to see and do The best way to see central Kiev is to take a stroll. Start at Bessarabska Square (closest metro: Ploshcha Lva Tolstoho), site of the central covered market, where among the fat cherries, bright scarlet radishes and slabs of pork fat, you can pick up a 100g jar of black caviar for a few quid. Quality's a bit of a gamble, and don't buy too many, or you might have trouble with Customs on the way out, but one or two should be okay. Walk up Taras Shevchenko Boulevard - one of Kiev's few remaining Lenin statues stands here - and, with the blood-red pillars of Kiev university on your left, take a right on to Volodymyrska Street. Passing the opera house, after a couple of blocks you reach the Golden Gate, a reconstruction of one of the gates in the once-mighty city walls which proved all too vulnerable to the Mongols when they attacked in 1216. Keep going along Volodymyrska and you get to St Sophia's, with its landmark blue and white bell tower. This is one of the most ancient complexes of buildings in eastern Christendom: part of it dates back to the 11th century. Pressing on past the statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Volodymyrska eventually ends with the sight of Rastrelli's knobbly baroque masterpiece, St Andrew's church, at the top of Andriyivsky Uzviz. This cobbled street winds steeply downhill towards the old port district of Podil. It's a pleasant place to eat or drink outdoors in summer, with beer gardens, restaurants and craft shops and stalls selling kitschy - mainly Russian - souvenirs. Halfway down is the house where Bulgakov grew up: it is now the Mikhail Bulgakov museum. Don't leave without visiting Pechersk monastery, a collection of gold and white Orthodox churches and belltowers strewn among the trees on the steep heights above the Dnieper. Nearby is the city's most striking monument to the Soviet era - a gigantic titanium figure of a woman with a sword and a shield called Motherland, with a gloomy, powerful war museum underneath. If the weather's fine, get a glimpse of how the youth of Kiev passes its summer days on the sandy beaches of Hidropark, an island park in the middle of the river with its own metro station (same name). Sunbathe, drink beer, and admire the glorious view of the monasteries among the trees on the far bank. Where to drink Bar wise, Ukrainian beers are now widely available -Obolon, once the local brew of choice, has been overtaken in popularity by Slavutych, from the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhya. Some of the trendier/ dodgier drinking dives are Blinadzh, (15a Mala Zhytomyrska); Oleksandria (6 Sahaydachnoho); Olzhin Dvir (7 Desyatinnyi); and, for a low-budget late-night dance experience, Vatra, (5 Metalistiv). More staid, ex-pat haunts include Eric's Bierstube (20 Chervonoarmiyska) and the inevitable Irish pub, O'Brien's (17a Mykhailivska).

Nothing else I have read, save Carolyn Steedman's Landscape for a Good Woman, destroys so successfully the fantasy of the family as a safe place to be or describes so well the way in which rage, grief and frustrated desire are passed down the family line like a curse, leaving offspring to live out the inherited, unresolved lives of their forebears. </p> <p>In a sense this is what autobiography is about: the ways in which your own story is not really yours at all, but a version of the tale of your parents or grandparents. These are the ways in which you become, as Steedman puts it, \"not quite yourself, but someone else\", and this is what makes it such a dissatisfying genre for those wanting a reassuring or comfortable description of the growth of an individual mind. </p> <p>The best memoirs can make for some curious narratives, and they can be least successful where they are most searching. In Henry James's childhood memoir, A Small Boy and Others, he omits himself altogether. It becomes apparent that this is what his experience of childhood actually was - a process not of developing out of his family but of absorbing himself back into it, living through them by means of what he later called \"shared consciousness\". Bad Blood is also a tale of shared consciousness, and although the lives Sage describes clash with and limit her own, there is much that is redemptive here, and even elegiac. </p> <p>Tales of disappointment form the bedrock of Lorna Sage's story. Her embittered grandmother, 4ft 10 and round as a barrel, longed for her hometown of Tonypandy, where she had some class as the daughter of a shopkeeper. She was consumed by an apoplectic hatred of all men, particularly her husband, whom she blackmailed from the other side of the house. Sage's mother swiftly retreated from the \"violently unhappy\" marriage of her parents into the \"magical world of unreality\", assuming a fey impracticality far from the model of the super-efficient 1950s housewife. </p> <p>The \"fierce monogamy\" of Sage's parents took on a violence of its own: their intimacy allowed no one in and made orphans of their two children. Her father, a distant figure, happiest during the war when he had a role and a mission, later gallantly protected his spouse from the passions of her family - and particularly those of Lorna, fiery and bookish and thus an inheritor of Grandpa's bad blood. </p> <p>It is Sage's Byronic grandfather, the local vicar, who provides the centre of the story, and around whom Sage forges her identity. Cursing a marriage that has neither love, understanding nor imagination, he turns to a life of unabashed wickedness. Indulging in lust and drink, he becomes for his granddaughter a \"defiant and grandly outrageous\" figure in his self-defeating recklessness, a Gothic outsider with all \"the glamour of the undead\". </p> <p>In Sage's celebration - or invention - of the glamorous alter ego beneath her grandfather's desperately limited life, Bad Blood is at its most gripping, and its most moving touch is her tribute to his thwarted ambition and ridiculed desires. Finding an old pocket diary for 1934 and decoding the banal secret life it records -\"It was the diary of a nobody\" - she quotes his hurt at being \"taunted\" by his teenage lover, a friend of his daughter, for resolving to escape the philistine values of the parish and the vicarage and to start a new life as a writer. \"That freelance existence never materialised for him,\" his grand-daughter writes; \"here are his words, though, in print at last.\" The vicar of Hanmer is redeemed from the \"squalor of insignificance\" he fought against. The heir of his bad blood has rewritten his story, giving to its grim drudgery the grandeur and dignity of a Greek tragedy. </p> <p> A central theme in Bad Blood is places and spaces, and how we learn to shape ourselves around them. Hanmer, on the borders of Wales and England and where Sage spends the first part of her childhood, becomes a metaphor for the suffocation of living \"in-between\": between the second world war and the 1960s, between the covers of books when there is no space left elsewhere, in the limited space between other people's lives. People and houses are imprisoning. It is only in the printed word that Lorna can breathe; even then she feels Grandpa looking over her shoulder as she reads. </p> <p>Sage is interested in lives that don't fit: family black sheep, misshapen marriages, homes too small to house either the hatred of their inhabitants or their exclusive love. Either way, other people are hell. Having lived sandwiched between these two marriages, Sage, believing she is still a virgin, unwittingly finds herself pregnant at 16 and embarking on her own marriage. Both she and Victor, the child's father, are doing their A-levels. </p> <p>It is here that the story closes, and it is given a happy ending. A daughter, Sharon, is born; Victor and Lorna both gain firsts in English from Durham University, and both join the English department at the new University of East Anglia. There are no doubt many other endings she might have chosen, but Sage breaks off at the point at which her life, if not her blood, became her own.</p>",

In 1980 a scrawny, seven-year-old boy knelt by his father\u0092s radio listening to his hero win the 10,000m at the Olympic Games in Moscow. The commentary on the BBC World Service crackled somewhat by the time it reached Ethiopia, but Miruts Yifter\u0092s victory sparked a dream with Haile Gebrselassie that gleams as brightly now as it did then. The spark for me was watching Ann Packer win the Olympic 800m in Tokyo in 1964. I came from a more privileged background than Haile in that I was able to watch my heroine on television, whereas he had to visualise his hero\u0092s success. But both of us shared the same dream and it has not changed one iota now. There will be hundreds of thousands of Hailes and Davids inspired by their heroes and heroines in Sydney in the forthcoming weeks.</p> <p>Sport is like society: it would be totally unreal if it did not have its share of corruption and cheating. But it is no different from any other aspect of life. Football hooliganism is not a reason for football to be banned. Dodgy betting syndicates are not a reason for cricket to be banned. Corrupt doctors are not a reason to stop practising medicine. The Olympics exemplify the strengths and weaknesses of humanity; and nobody can seriously doubt that there are many more strengths than weaknesses.</p> <p>David Moorcroft</p> <p><b>Dear David,</b><br> I\u0092m in Melbourne tonight where 44 years ago, Vladimir Kuts won one of the most dramatic ever Olympic 10,000m races, playing cat and mouse with Britain\u0092s plucky Gordon Pirie on the way. That race inspired me. This boy clipped the newspapers and, before wall-to-wall TV coverage, waited impatiently for the arrival of the official film. Then I went on to live my more realistic dream; running middle and long distances for my club and county.</p> <p>Then the dream died. When we watch the track warriors of Sydney in a week\u0092s time, we\u0092ll be schizoid. Oh what a performance! Followed by, oh God, tell me they\u0092re not dopers. And neither of us can.</p> <p>In those days of inspiration, drugs were something doctors dispensed to make you better \u0096 not faster. The unaccountable officials who control international sports bodies like the IOC have mostly avoided any war on drugs, preferring to squander their fabulous income on personal lifestyle perks.</p> <p>These days I look outside the stadium for inspiration. For me, the heroes we should celebrate today are the under-reported community activists in Atlanta, Nagano and Sydney. They battle local politicians and business interests hellbent on diverting taxes from health, education, housing and welfare \u0096 and aboriginal rights \u0096 into fat contracts to build vainglorious sports facilities. </p> <p>You remind me that the Olympics exemplify our strengths and weaknesses. But sadly today, it\u0092s more the weaknesses.</p> <p>Yours, etc,<br> Andrew</p> <p><b>Dear Andrew,</b><br> Why did your dream die? Mine burns as brightly as when Ann Packer won the 800m at the 1964 Olympics. I believe in the majority, not minorities, and the majority of athletes still get by with exactly the same honest endeavour as Vladimir Kuts and Gordon Pirie all those years ago. They were postwar heroes from an imperfect world that had allowed millions to die in the name of political ideals. Sport does so much to bring opposing factions together: Kuts and Pirie represented opposing factions in the cold war. The world remains imperfect, but we have to believe in the majority. Despite the financial rewards in our sport now, most still compete for self-esteem \u0096 without cheating.</p> <p>I congratulate you for exposing weaknesses in institutions, if what you say is true. By coincidence, I spent this evening in north London at a meeting called so that the public could say what they want in the new national athletics stadium. All opted for facilities to encourage more youngsters into athletics. This will be the stadium of many young people\u0092s dreams. Just as the White City was the stadium in which my hero, Chris Chataway, beat your hero, Vladimir Kuts. Chris will be at the Olympics in Sydney. To him, it\u0092s still as exciting now as it was then. And it will be for the youngsters who learn to fulfil dreams at Lee Valley.</p> <p>Yours sincerely, David</p> <p><b>Dear David,</b>Our dreams seem similar \u0096 drug-free Olympic sport. But that won\u0092t be realised until today\u0092s Olympic poobahs are sent packing and replaced by democratically elected officials, a new, transparent organisation and a credible commitment to tackle the problem.</p> <p>Today in Sydney I find the papers full of stories of a torrent of suspected dopers withdrawing from the games because they fear the new test for the endurance drug, EPO. This heartening news was undermined within hours by the announcement that customs officers at the airport have seized a quantity of human growth hormone (HGH). It\u0092s the same drug customs found in the baggage of a Chinese official arriving for the world swimming championships in Australia 31 months ago.</p> <p>HGH is the rocket fuel of athletics, building big, medal-winning bodies. Many track commentators believe HGH powered the late Florence Griffith Joyner \u0096 the exotic Flo-Jo \u0096 to world sprint records in Seoul in 1988. The International Olympic Committee has not fussed itself with funding scientific research, so there is no test. The cheats can smirk their way to the podium.</p> <p>I agree with you; the majority of athletes are not drug fuelled \u0096 but they can\u0092t all win golds. Only a few can and you\u0092ll know the common view in the athletics community that many of the elite performers are using drugs. They will be the role models for the youngsters who will flock to the national athletics stadium. To be honest, I\u0092m already weeping into my ale.</p> <p>All the best,<br> Andrew</p> <p><b>Dear Andrew,</b><br> We\u0092ve never met but I\u0092m a bit worried about your alcohol consumption. I\u0092d hate to think you use beer as a performance enhancer for your writing!</p> <p>You\u0092re right that our dream is identical \u0096 to be inspired by honest Olympian endeavour. It\u0092s our expectations that differ. The extra safeguards in Sydney are impressive and it would be wonderful if a proportion of the incredible wealth generated by the games could be spent on improved education and quality research into better testing. But I do think attitudes are changing and can continue to change. Sport reflects society as it is and not as it used to be (or necessarily as we wish it ideally would be). But much as fashions change, ideology can make a comeback, with the result that we could well be sitting in our new national athletics stadium in 2012, 2016 or 2020, saying: \u0093The Olympic ideal flickered, was almost extinguished, yet somehow survived.\u0094 One has to imagine that possibility because the alternative is to give up on the hope offered by sporting integrity and admit defeat. Isn\u0092t it?</p> <p>Let\u0092s enjoy Sydney with an attitude of tempered optimism. But on the off-chance I\u0092m wrong, I\u0092m off down the pub now.

Then there's the huge variety of scenery and wildlife you encounter as you descend from the \"put-in\" point at 6,000ft-high Boundary Creek to the \"take out\", 3,000ft below at the confluence with the main Salmon. </p> <p>The relative lack of really serious white-water means that the river is accessible to pretty much anyone with a sense of adventure - I was on a six-day trip with a group of Texans all of whom were the wrong side of 40, and all of whom had a great time. </p> <p>At the put-in point, the Middle Fork would be unlikely to get anyone too excited - generally narrow and shallow, this is not the kind of whitewater maelstrom you see on all the raft ing posters. What you get instead is inspiring mountain scenery on either side of the river. Even in July, there are snow patches on the highest of the peaks, which rise up to between 7,000ft and 9,000ft, and you may spot any number of wild creatures ambling along the river banks, including black bears, deer, elk, big horn sheep, and, if you're really lucky, cougars, grizzlies and wolves. </p> <p>The upper part of the river is quite mellow, and there are plenty of opportunities to sit back in your raft and watch the landscape drift by, or hang a line over the side and wait for a salmon or trout to bite (although being a Wilderness Area, all fish are taken on a catch-and-release basis). At the first campsite, you realise just how serious the practice of \"pack it in, pack it out\" is in the wilderness, applying to human waste and toothpaste spit as well as the more usual detritus of a camping trip. </p> <p>Camping is in two-person tents, with campsites invariably based on idyllic white-sand beaches beside the river, with a backdrop of pine forests and blue mountains. Meals, cooked by the guides, are also excellent and varied, there's plenty of beer and wine, and it doesn't take long to crash out to the sound of the nearby current. </p> <p>That said, if you take a hike from the camp-site up the canyon sides, there's every chance of seeing a big-horn sheep or deer, less so a bear (it pays to be \"bear aware\" if you're heading out into the back country). Ironically, it's perhaps on a lone hike before the evening meal that you're most likely to get a feel for the isolation and challenge that this landscape provided for the pioneers who stumbled through here less than 100 years ago. </p> <p>Away from the chatter and clatter of the camp-site, looking at the river flowing ceaselessly towards the far distant Pacific Ocean and the peaks and forests bearing down from above, it's not hard to imagine the awesome and sometimes frightening beauty that Idaho presented to those early travellers. Nor is it hard to understand why the native Sheepeater Indians, whose pictographs you may stumble across, revered and worshipped such an uncompromising and elemental landscape. </p> <p>Back on the river, it wasn't until day three of the trip that white-water started to become a regular thing, and I flipped out of my \"ducky\" (a single-person inflatable kayak) at the first sign of turbulence. But, as more and more Class III rapids assaulted us, I was surprised at how easy they were to deal with if you follow the river guide's advice. On day four, we hit our first Class III/IV rapids. One of them, Redside, is regarded as one of the 50 classic rapids in the US, so it was with no small measure of trepidation that I approached it alone in a duckie. </p> <p>All I could really see of it was a vague blur of white water and what followed was a good deal of bouncing around and a thorough soaking. Shooting a rapid of this size appears to boil down to a combination of anxiety and adrenalin, with, ideally, the adrenalin winning out and taking you through. It's only afterwards that you realise it was also fun. </p> <p>It's also a sobering thought that only 30 years ago this was still pioneer territory as far as kayakers and rafters were concerned, and even today only limited numbers are allowed on the Middle Fork each year during the June-September white-water season, so you're still very much in a part of the world that relatively few others have travelled through. </p> <p>The next day was different - shafts of hot sunlight beamed down from above the canyon walls to glimmer off the deep and fast flowing green waters, a noticeable change from the clear, shallow river upstream where you could see each rock beneath the surface and trout feeding on the bottom. Today's rapids would be nearly all Class III, some approaching IV, and at Devil's Tooth Rapids, I was unceremoniously flicked out of my ducky by a wave - more a solid wall of water, actually. But the swim was fun, my pride wasn't hurt, and I'd go back any time and do it again - as would every other member of our group. </p> <p>And if you bear in mind that this was anything but the Red Bull generation taking on one of America's best white-water challenges, it's pretty safe to say that rafting is a sport for anyone who doesn't mind getting wet. </p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong><br> </p> <p> The easiest way to reach the Middle Fork of the Salmon is from Boise, the capital of Idaho.

      "body": "<p>Britain's millennium celebrations testified to a peculiar vision of nationhood. The national beacon, lit by the Queen to kindle a chain of flame from London to Aberdeen, was a gigantic crucible on which British Gas was scored in words 11 metres long beneath a crown of 18 BG logos. The Millennium Dome exhibits the work of some of our most cherished national institutions: the American companies Manpower and Ford. Its Body Zone was sponsored by Boots, its Mind Zone by the weapons manufacturer British Aerospace, and its Learning Zone by Tesco. </p> <p>Its Our Town stage, where \"the diversity of local culture is celebrated\", was financed by that guardian of diversity, McDonald's. British Airways and the British Airports Authority used the Journey Zone to explain to visitors the advantages of Heathrow Airport's proposed Terminal 5, in which they both have a certain interest. </p> <p>At the 1999 Labour party conference, Tony Blair told delegates he would \"set the people free\" by creating \"a model 21st-century nation, based... on the equal worth of all\". But some attendees at the conference were worth rather more than others. To reach the speeches, delegates had to fight their way past 62 corporate stalls: it looked more like a trade fair than a political gathering. </p> <p>The conference's fringe meeting on social justice in a global economy was sponsored by the Swiss company ABB, the builders of the turbines for the Three Gorges Dam in China, which displaced over a million people from the land. The meeting on holding government and companies to account was sponsored by the lottery company Camelot. The meeting on renewing democracy and rebuilding communities was financed by Tesco, widely blamed for shattering communities with their out-of-town superstores. When Lord Whitty, a minister at the department of the environment, was asked by the BBC whether the exhibitors at the conference were buying access to ministers, he replied: \"You don't buy access to ministers. You buy access to the whole party.\" I think he was trying to reassure us. </p> <p>These are the outward signs of the corporate takeover of Britain, crude and trivial manifestations of a deeper problem. Corporations, the contraptions we invented to serve us, are overthrowing us. They are seizing powers previously invested in government, and using them to distort public life to suit their own ends. </p> <p>The government shows few signs of concern about this coup d'etat. New Labour, its leaders often remind us, is the party of business, aiming to establish the most business-friendly environment in the world. There is, Blair told the Confederation of British Industry, \"great commitment and enthusiasm, right across the government, for forging links with the business community\". \"We want a society,\" the cabinet minister Peter Mandelson announced, \"that celebrates and values its business heroes as much as its pop stars and footballers.\" </p> <p>The struggle between people and corporations will be the defining battle of the 21st century. If the corporations win, liberal democracy will come to an end. The great social democratic institutions which have defended the weak against the strong - equality before the law, representative government, democratic accountability and the sovereignty of parliament - will be toppled. If the corporate attempt on public life is beaten back, then democracy may re-emerge the stronger for its conquest. But this victory cannot be brokered by our representatives. Democracy will survive only if the people in whose name they govern rescue the state from captivity. </p> <p>My story begins on the Isle of Skye, which became, under the Conservatives, the laboratory for a novel experiment. As the terms under which it is being conducted have come to light, it has developed into a scandal of the kind associated with Brazil, rather than Britain: the Labour government is now caught in this scandal. </p> <p>Skye lies over the sea. This topographical distinction delights the tourists following the flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie. But by the end of the 1980s, it was a nuisance to the residents. Car ferries connecting the island to the mainland kept breaking down, so that people often had to queue for two or three hours. Some residents called for a bridge. The strait, or kyle, that separated Skye from the mainland, they argued, was scarcely a mile wide at its narrowest point. English islands close to the mainland coast were served by roads; was it not time for Skye to be connected to the national network? </p> <p>The Scottish Office, a department of the Conservative government, agreed. Road building was, at the time, a central component of the government's economic programme. There was, it told the people of Skye, just one problem: it had no money. Public funds spent on building a bridge would be funds not spent on the island's health and education. Rather than be defeated by this, it had devised a new and remarkable solution. </p> <p>The people of Skye would get their bridge, but it would be financed by a private company. The company would build the structure at its own expense, then recoup the money by charging a toll. The Skye Bridge would be the first project built under something called the private finance initiative (PFI). This, started by the Conservatives and developed by Labour, has become the means by which many new roads, bridges, rail links, schools, hospitals and prisons in Britain are now built. </p> <p>In the week the bridge opened, in October 1995, the government-run ferry service stopped: the only efficient means of getting to Skye was the bridge. This might have been uncontroversial had the toll the private companies levied not been the highest, per metre of road, in the world. The one-mile crossing now costs \u00a35.70 each way. </p> <p>A legal discovery by veteran campaigner and folk singer Robbie the Pict convinced the people of Skye that the tolls were worth fighting. The toll regime, Robbie believed, breached Article 18 of the Act of Union, which forbids the Crown to levy a tax in Scotland in circumstances not encountered in England. As there was no sole road crossing to an inshore island which was tolled in England, and as the Scottish Office told the European Union that the tolls should be classified as a tax, the charges looked to Robbie like a violation of the act. </p> <p> Convinced that they had a constitutional as well as a moral case, the islanders began one of the biggest and most sustained campaigns of civil disobedience in Scotland since the Lewis Risings of 1919. It started with a petition, circulated by the West Highland Free Press. Though Skye has only 10,000 inhabitants, within a few weeks 7,000 people had signed up, demanding a free crossing rather than a toll bridge. They were ignored. So, when the bridge opened, many of the islanders refused to pay: 600 people - crofters, shopkeepers, doctors, factory workers and engineers, most of whom had never been in trouble before - were arrested. Some collected dozens of charges: Robbie was arraigned on 129. The Highlands police and judicial systems nearly collapsed beneath the load. The islanders launched legal counter-suits. </p> <p>The toll company changed its tactics. It stopped calling the police and refused to let the non-payers pass. So the islanders devised new means of frustrating their captors. Some days they would pay the toll penny by penny, blocking the bridge for hours. They would bring cardboard cheques so large that they wouldn't fit through the toll-booth window. They discovered that the collecting company banked its money on Friday, so 30 people agreed to arrive at intervals on a Saturday morning with \u00a3100 notes and no change. </p> <p>I met Robbie the Pict playing football around the toll booth on the bridge in the summer of 1998. He had discovered that Hamilton Park, the land on which the toll booth and the approach road were built, had been established with a deed that only a compulsory purchase order could repeal. In its hurry to get the bridge built, the Scottish Office had initiated compulsory purchase proceedings but forgot to complete them. Legally, the land remained a designated recreation area, and Robbie and friends were lawfully entitled to play football there, and use the barrier as a goal: \"They don't want to arrest us for this one as they don't want the issue raised in court. We could mount a legal challenge to the existence of the toll booths.\" </p> <p>The islanders discovered that the company empowered by the government to collect the tolls had changed its name, while the deed which appeared to allow it to charge the money remained the same. So Robbie bought the discarded company name - Skye Bridge Tolls Ltd - and insisted that he, and not the consortium, now had the legal right to collect the money. When the company protested, he offered to sell them the original name for \u00a31m, and demanded that they \"remove our good name\" from the documents they were using \"for the purpose of exacting money from road users\". \"I've got a right,\" he told me, \"to collect the tolls. One of these days I'm going to set up in a garden shed and if the police come I'll tell them, 'I've got the paperwork: it's them you should be arresting.'\" </p> <p>The protesters put in a bid to buy the bridge, and another to acquire the ferries that used to run across the kyle. Both were, unsurprisingly, rejected by the Scottish Office, which says that the bridge is owned by a consortium of three firms: two construction companies and the Bank of America. But the islanders later discovered that, by the time the bridge opened, the ownership had changed dramatically. One thousand shares had been issued. The Bank of America had 997 , while the remaining three were in the hands of Bank of America nominees. The bank was sole controller of the bridge. The other companies were employed merely to collect the tolls on its behalf and transfer the money to America. The Scottish Office had twice issued misleading statements about this. </p> <p>The Bank of America, previously known as the Bank of Italy, has a blemished record. In November 1998, it settled with 250 American government agencies which had sued it, after admitting that it had improperly shifted unclaimed payments into its own accounts instead of returning them to the public bodies to which they belonged. Most islanders' tolls are transferred to the bank headquarters in California. Skye had become, according to the protesters, part of a US banking gulag, a colonial penitentiary in which they were held to ransom. </p> <p>They chose Independence Day to demand release from their imperial masters. On July 4 1998, the Crofter's Kitchen cafe, on the Skye side of the bridge, was in uproar; 100 people crammed into it, singing, laughing and shouting. At the time advertised, the residents quietly filed into the car park. Robbie Cormack, a big man with a ginger moustache, brought out a clipboard. As he announced the names of the American states, protesters in fancy dress took placards: Florida went to a gigantic orange carton, with its ingredients listed as \"pure Florida orange, diluted with Scottish Office mandarins\". Mississippi went to a ghoul in a white hood and cape. </p> <p>Other protesters took banners reading \"Welcome to Skye, the \u00a35.60 state\" and \"Bank of America: The bank that likes to say gimme\". An accordionist struck up The Yellow Rose of Texas, and the Independence from America March set off past the sign the protesters had legally and perma nently installed on the roundabout (\"Beware: bogus toll collectors ahead\") and over the bridge to the mainland. </p> <p>The postmaster, Drew Millar, claiming to be Bill Clinton's special representative, apologised that the president couldn't be with them: he had, regrettably \"gotten held up in the bathroom, helping one of his interns to grasp the essentials of the body politic\". But, he went on, \"I would like to welcome you to the 51st state of America, and thank you sincerely for all the contributions you've made to our federal tax-take.\" </p> <p>There is a sheriff's court on the island, but the Crown insisted on trying protesters (378 islanders were prosecuted) in Dingwall, 120 miles away. Because of the caseload, and the etiolated nature of sheriff's court procedures, some defendants had to turn up in court as many as 15 times to defend a single case of the non-payment of \u00a35. \"They are trying to wear us down,\" Robbie the Pict told me, \"but they won't succeed.\" </p> <p> Another islander, John Campbell, who trained as an engineer, looked into the financing of the project. The bridge, according to the Miller Group, which built it, cost \u00a325m. The Scottish Office initially contributed \u00a313m. The European Investment Bank added \u00a313m. Private investors paid in \u00a37.5m, the contractors \u00a30.5m, and a commercial bank \u00a36m: a total of \u00a340m. The bridge was 60% overfinanced. </p> <p>The only explanation the islanders could suggest is that the investors believed the bridge would make a great deal of money, and they wanted to buy into a stake. The \u00a325m project will extract, for its private backers and the Bank of America, \u00a388m from one of the poorest places in the British Isles. </p> <p>So the people of Skye must pay a fee to an American bank every time they want to go to or from their island, although the costs of the bridge have already been met by the taxpayer and the European Investment Bank. The government had no need to use the PFI to build the bridge. As Skye lies within a regional development area, it could have asked the EU to provide nearly all the money for a toll-free crossing. The means of finance have nothing to do with saving public money. Far from Westminster and national newspapers, out of sight, out of mind, Skye was the ideal location for launching a corrupt, unpopular initiative, in which private companies were granted monopolistic control over public works. </p> <p>The people of Skye had every reason to believe that a Labour government would overturn the tolls. In 1995, Brian Wilson MP, who was to become the minister for industry in the Scottish Office and, later, a minister at the department for trade and industry, described the bridge as \"a shocking story of ideologues using a remote place for an experiment that they could not have got away with anywhere else\". The toll regime, he announced, was \"immoral, unacceptable and unjust\"; while the people of Skye were the \"near-monopoly prisoners of... ruthless commercial interests\". In 1996, he joined the demonstrators, marching over the bridge with a pipe band, and announced that the Tartan Toll Tax was \"an injustice which will not be meekly acquiesced in\". In the same year, Calum MacDonald MP, now a minister in the Scottish Office, asked his opposite number: \"Isn't it about time that he listened to the weight of public opinion... and scrap[ped] this toll regime?\" </p> <p>The local Labour candidate for the 1997 general election, Donnie Munro (formerly the lead singer of Runrig), told voters: \"The Labour party is committed to work in partnership to abolish the tolls within the shortest practicable timescale.\" The Scottish Labour party published a full-page ad to this effect in the West Highland Free Press a week before the election. </p> <p>Soon after the election was won, ministers announced that scrap ping the tolls would be impossible. It would, they maintained, cost \u00a330m to buy out the contract, which is more than the bridge cost to design and build. Brian Wilson told Scotland on Sunday: \"It's just a lie to say that either I or the Labour party promised to abolish the tolls.\" When the islanders requested that they be allowed to reopen the kyle ferry service and run it in competition with the bridge, Wilson told them it was a silly stunt. </p> <p>\"What hurts us most,\" John Campbell told me, \"is the sense of betrayal. These ministers were campaigners before they got into power. Now they're just suits.\" </p> <p>The Bank of America has continued to thrive in Britain. Before the election, the consortium to which it belonged won the contract to build the privately financed A30 dual carriageway in Devon. Since the election, it has become the lending bank for the \u00a31bn PFI contract to update and operate London Transport's ticketing services. </p> <p>In Skye, the court cases grind on. The islanders have now taken their appeals to the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. But their demonstrations have diminished. Exhausted and impoverished, the people of Skye no longer have either the energy or the resources to sustain the pressure of the last few years. But they have not given up, and some say they never will. Because their battle is just the opening chapter of the corporate takeover of Britain. </p> <p>\u0095 This piece is an edited extract from The Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain (Macmillan, \u00a312.99)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's millennium celebrations testified to a peculiar vision of nationhood. The national beacon, lit by the Queen to kindle a chain of flame from London to Aberdeen, was a gigantic crucible on which British Gas was scored in words 11 metres long beneath a crown of 18 BG logos. The Millennium Dome exhibits the work of some of our most cherished national institutions: the American companies Manpower and Ford. Its Body Zone was sponsored by Boots, its Mind Zone by the weapons manufacturer British Aerospace, and its Learning Zone by Tesco. Its Our Town stage, where \"the diversity of local culture is celebrated\", was financed by that guardian of diversity, McDonald's. British Airways and the British Airports Authority used the Journey Zone to explain to visitors the advantages of Heathrow Airport's proposed Terminal 5, in which they both have a certain interest. At the 1999 Labour party conference, Tony Blair told delegates he would \"set the people free\" by creating \"a model 21st-century nation, based... on the equal worth of all\". But some attendees at the conference were worth rather more than others. To reach the speeches, delegates had to fight their way past 62 corporate stalls: it looked more like a trade fair than a political gathering. The conference's fringe meeting on social justice in a global economy was sponsored by the Swiss company ABB, the builders of the turbines for the Three Gorges Dam in China, which displaced over a million people from the land. The meeting on holding government and companies to account was sponsored by the lottery company Camelot. The meeting on renewing democracy and rebuilding communities was financed by Tesco, widely blamed for shattering communities with their out-of-town superstores. When Lord Whitty, a minister at the department of the environment, was asked by the BBC whether the exhibitors at the conference were buying access to ministers, he replied: \"You don't buy access to ministers. You buy access to the whole party.\" I think he was trying to reassure us. These are the outward signs of the corporate takeover of Britain, crude and trivial manifestations of a deeper problem. Corporations, the contraptions we invented to serve us, are overthrowing us. They are seizing powers previously invested in government, and using them to distort public life to suit their own ends. The government shows few signs of concern about this coup d'etat. New Labour, its leaders often remind us, is the party of business, aiming to establish the most business-friendly environment in the world. There is, Blair told the Confederation of British Industry, \"great commitment and enthusiasm, right across the government, for forging links with the business community\". \"We want a society,\" the cabinet minister Peter Mandelson announced, \"that celebrates and values its business heroes as much as its pop stars and footballers.\" The struggle between people and corporations will be the defining battle of the 21st century. If the corporations win, liberal democracy will come to an end. The great social democratic institutions which have defended the weak against the strong - equality before the law, representative government, democratic accountability and the sovereignty of parliament - will be toppled. If the corporate attempt on public life is beaten back, then democracy may re-emerge the stronger for its conquest. But this victory cannot be brokered by our representatives. Democracy will survive only if the people in whose name they govern rescue the state from captivity. My story begins on the Isle of Skye, which became, under the Conservatives, the laboratory for a novel experiment. As the terms under which it is being conducted have come to light, it has developed into a scandal of the kind associated with Brazil, rather than Britain: the Labour government is now caught in this scandal. Skye lies over the sea. This topographical distinction delights the tourists following the flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie. But by the end of the 1980s, it was a nuisance to the residents. Car ferries connecting the island to the mainland kept breaking down, so that people often had to queue for two or three hours. Some residents called for a bridge. The strait, or kyle, that separated Skye from the mainland, they argued, was scarcely a mile wide at its narrowest point. English islands close to the mainland coast were served by roads; was it not time for Skye to be connected to the national network? The Scottish Office, a department of the Conservative government, agreed. Road building was, at the time, a central component of the government's economic programme. There was, it told the people of Skye, just one problem: it had no money. Public funds spent on building a bridge would be funds not spent on the island's health and education. Rather than be defeated by this, it had devised a new and remarkable solution. The people of Skye would get their bridge, but it would be financed by a private company. The company would build the structure at its own expense, then recoup the money by charging a toll. The Skye Bridge would be the first project built under something called the private finance initiative (PFI). This, started by the Conservatives and developed by Labour, has become the means by which many new roads, bridges, rail links, schools, hospitals and prisons in Britain are now built. In the week the bridge opened, in October 1995, the government-run ferry service stopped: the only efficient means of getting to Skye was the bridge. This might have been uncontroversial had the toll the private companies levied not been the highest, per metre of road, in the world. The one-mile crossing now costs \u00a35.70 each way. A legal discovery by veteran campaigner and folk singer Robbie the Pict convinced the people of Skye that the tolls were worth fighting. The toll regime, Robbie believed, breached Article 18 of the Act of Union, which forbids the Crown to levy a tax in Scotland in circumstances not encountered in England. As there was no sole road crossing to an inshore island which was tolled in England, and as the Scottish Office told the European Union that the tolls should be classified as a tax, the charges looked to Robbie like a violation of the act. Convinced that they had a constitutional as well as a moral case, the islanders began one of the biggest and most sustained campaigns of civil disobedience in Scotland since the Lewis Risings of 1919. It started with a petition, circulated by the West Highland Free Press. Though Skye has only 10,000 inhabitants, within a few weeks 7,000 people had signed up, demanding a free crossing rather than a toll bridge. They were ignored. So, when the bridge opened, many of the islanders refused to pay: 600 people - crofters, shopkeepers, doctors, factory workers and engineers, most of whom had never been in trouble before - were arrested. Some collected dozens of charges: Robbie was arraigned on 129. The Highlands police and judicial systems nearly collapsed beneath the load. The islanders launched legal counter-suits. The toll company changed its tactics. It stopped calling the police and refused to let the non-payers pass. So the islanders devised new means of frustrating their captors. Some days they would pay the toll penny by penny, blocking the bridge for hours. They would bring cardboard cheques so large that they wouldn't fit through the toll-booth window. They discovered that the collecting company banked its money on Friday, so 30 people agreed to arrive at intervals on a Saturday morning with \u00a3100 notes and no change. I met Robbie the Pict playing football around the toll booth on the bridge in the summer of 1998. He had discovered that Hamilton Park, the land on which the toll booth and the approach road were built, had been established with a deed that only a compulsory purchase order could repeal.

In every brushstroke he seemed to express an isolated, alienated vision - the vision of, in the words of Antonin Artaud, the man suicided by society. </p> <p><strong> Subject:</strong> Van Gogh, after he cut off his own earlobe following a violent argument with fellow painter Paul Gauguin, whom he idolised and who came to stay with him in Arles in Provence in October 1888. In 1890 he shot himself. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features: </strong>It is hard not to feel Van Gogh's eyes pierce you when you look at this painting. His agonised, pitiful presence is almost unbearable. Every brushstroke registers physically. You can see every mark he made on the canvas and feel the weight of each dollop of blue or yellow pigment. This gives the portrait a shocking immediacy. And then there's the thin face, like Christ in a late medieval painting, with the red beard brutally shaved off. He seems to shiver inside his heavy coat and hat, with its strange fur like a black cloud emanating from his brain. In this painting, the warmth of Provence that van Gogh painted in his Sunflowers has given way to winter. </p> <p>Van Gogh shows the bandage on his mutilated ear like a saint displaying the stigmata. His head is turned to give us a better view. But this is a shameful self-portrait, raw with Van Gogh's horror and acceptance of what he has done to himself. The act of self-mutilation has changed Van Gogh. He has become this walking emblem of what it is to live the life of art. </p> <p>When Van Gogh went to live in the south of France in 1888 he expected to be happy. He wrote to his brother Theo that he hoped his life there would be more and more like a Japanese painter's. For late 19th-century European artists the tradi tional art of Japan represented a utopian aestheticism. But in this self-portrait the Japanese picture on the wall behind Van Gogh is a lost paradise. His own easel stands to the left, and the canvas on it is blank. It resembles what would later be called a monochrome. In that void, Van Gogh sees his own art, in contrast to the human richness of the Japanese pastoral scene. </p> <p>This emptiness seeps between the fierce strokes of Van Gogh's self-portrait. In all his paintings you can often see the thin canvas just below the brushwork. Pigment builds up in rough piles, in irresistible rhythms, but always there is the sense of the space between strokes. In this painting the abstract repetition of brushstrokes is frightening. Van Gogh's coat is composed of scarily overpoweringblue lines. The yellow wall behind him has the same monotonous straight lines. </p> <p><strong> Inspirations and influences: </strong> Van Gogh's <a href=\"http://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/p_0527.htm \" target=\"_new\">Self-Portrait With A Bandaged Ear</a> has been echoed many times over, especially since the 1970s when the artist's body became a material for making art. In 1970 Vito Acconci squatted in an art gallery biting himself in as many places as possible in his performance Trademarks. In 1971 Chris Burden stood in an art gallery and had a friend shoot him in the arm with a rifle. He also had himself crucified and electrocuted. In 1993 Catherine Opie did a self-portrait photograph of her naked back, with a picture of a lesbian couple in front of a house and garden carved into her flesh with a razor blade. </p> <p><strong> Where is it?</strong> Courtauld Gallery, London WC2 (020-7848 2526). </p>",

      "bodyText": "\u00b7 View the work online Artist: Vincent Van Gogh (1853-90), the definitive modern artist in that his life and work broke with traditional social bonds. In every brushstroke he seemed to express an isolated, alienated vision - the vision of, in the words of Antonin Artaud, the man suicided by society. Subject: Van Gogh, after he cut off his own earlobe following a violent argument with fellow painter Paul Gauguin, whom he idolised and who came to stay with him in Arles in Provence in October 1888. In 1890 he shot himself. Distinguishing features: It is hard not to feel Van Gogh's eyes pierce you when you look at this painting. His agonised, pitiful presence is almost unbearable. Every brushstroke registers physically. You can see every mark he made on the canvas and feel the weight of each dollop of blue or yellow pigment. This gives the portrait a shocking immediacy. And then there's the thin face, like Christ in a late medieval painting, with the red beard brutally shaved off. He seems to shiver inside his heavy coat and hat, with its strange fur like a black cloud emanating from his brain. In this painting, the warmth of Provence that van Gogh painted in his Sunflowers has given way to winter. Van Gogh shows the bandage on his mutilated ear like a saint displaying the stigmata. His head is turned to give us a better view. But this is a shameful self-portrait, raw with Van Gogh's horror and acceptance of what he has done to himself. The act of self-mutilation has changed Van Gogh. He has become this walking emblem of what it is to live the life of art. When Van Gogh went to live in the south of France in 1888 he expected to be happy. He wrote to his brother Theo that he hoped his life there would be more and more like a Japanese painter's. For late 19th-century European artists the tradi tional art of Japan represented a utopian aestheticism. But in this self-portrait the Japanese picture on the wall behind Van Gogh is a lost paradise. His own easel stands to the left, and the canvas on it is blank. It resembles what would later be called a monochrome. In that void, Van Gogh sees his own art, in contrast to the human richness of the Japanese pastoral scene. This emptiness seeps between the fierce strokes of Van Gogh's self-portrait. In all his paintings you can often see the thin canvas just below the brushwork. Pigment builds up in rough piles, in irresistible rhythms, but always there is the sense of the space between strokes. In this painting the abstract repetition of brushstrokes is frightening. Van Gogh's coat is composed of scarily overpoweringblue lines. The yellow wall behind him has the same monotonous straight lines. Inspirations and influences: Van Gogh's Self-Portrait With A Bandaged Ear has been echoed many times over, especially since the 1970s when the artist's body became a material for making art. In 1970 Vito Acconci squatted in an art gallery biting himself in as many places as possible in his performance Trademarks. In 1971 Chris Burden stood in an art gallery and had a friend shoot him in the arm with a rifle. He also had himself crucified and electrocuted. In 1993 Catherine Opie did a self-portrait photograph of her naked back, with a picture of a lesbian couple in front of a house and garden carved into her flesh with a razor blade. Where is it? Courtauld Gallery, London WC2 (020-7848 2526).",

His father was editor of the Rand Daily Mail in South Africa and a noted historian of the mining industry there. \"But he used to say to people: 'Don't tell my parents I work on a newspaper,'\" laughs Cartwright. \"'They think I play piano in a brothel.'\" </p> <p>Cartwright did holiday work at the paper and, he says, \"always won the essay prize at school and things like that\". With no television at home, he was a voracious reader who had finished War and Peace by the time he was 15 and wrote \"pretentious\" plays while at school. \"But I really wanted to be a filmmaker, although I ended up in advertising instead.\" </p> <p>After university in South Africa and then Oxford, he started work for a London agency in the mid-1970s and has lived in the city ever since. His most famous campaign was for dog food. \"Believe it or not, Prime Pal is for dogs\" was the killer line, and Cartwright won several industry awards. He went on to make television documentaries, and is currently working on a screenplay, but says he learned little from his time in advertising. </p> <p>\"I suppose on the filmmaking side you can learn how to cram a lot into a small space,\" he says. \"But I think that advertising, even on what is called the creative side, is incredibly easy if you have that kind of mind. A lot of people regard it as Machiavellian and dangerous, but in fact it is morally neutral. You are trying to sell something and the people know you are trying to sell something.\" </p> <p>One use he did make of his ability to sell was as the man in charge of election broadcasts for the Liberal Party, and then the Alliance, at the 1979, 1983 and 1987 general elections. He says the recent complaints about the power of spin-doctors are nothing new. \"Even then, it was assumed that people like me had undue influence. But the fact is that politicians are so incredibly busy they need other people to write their speeches and brief them. I don't think Alastair Campbell has any secret agenda. Most of it is reactive.\" </p> <p>For a writer whose work is almost routinely shortlisted for major literary awards, his early efforts at fiction are perhaps surprising. He wrote a novelisation of an episode from the New Avengers, which appeared with fetching shots of Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt on the cover. \"I didn't even read the script,\" he admits. \"I just opened it and started to write the novel. But when I got to the end I was 30 pages short of my target length, so I made up another ending.\" </p> <p>He then wrote two thrillers in the late 1970s which sold quite well but didn't engage him. \"I wanted to do something that could be called literature. I'd done these thrillers because of an advertising frame of mind - I thought I should do something commercial rather than go with any gut feelings.\" He calls his next novel, Freedom of Wolves, an \"interim\" book, and says the real breakthrough came with the 1988 Interior. Set in an imaginary African country, it cleverly and comically subverts Conrad and Rider Haggard as the narrator, Curtiz, retraces a journey undertaken by his late father. The book was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize. </p> <p>\"It didn't make much difference financially,\" says Cartwright, \"but it helped me enormously in that it confirmed that this is what I wanted to do. It was incredibly reassuring.\" The book also won prizes in South Africa, and while Cartwright will \"never write the great South African novel\", he is still interested in literary developments there. \"I thought that, post-apartheid, there would be absolutely no interest in South Africa. That has been both true and untrue. The major writers like Gordimer and Coetzee have produced major books. But some of the more minor writers have drifted away.\" </p> <p>The follow-up to Interiors was Look at It This Way, a novel set in a fantastical London in which a lion has escaped from the zoo. It too was shortlisted for the Whitbread. Masai Dreaming in 1993 again featured Curtiz, before Cartwright returned to a London location for In Every Face I Meet, which was shortlisted for the Booker. His most recent book, Leading the Cheers, was set in America and won the Whitbread Best Novel prize in 1998. Cartwright had been an exchange student at a school in Michigan, and returned there in the mid-1990s for a reunion. \"I bumped all that up for the novel,\" he says. \"The writs haven't come in yet.\" </p> <p>He now spends most mornings writing in the London Library, where he can find \"peace and tranquillity. If I was at home I'd find myself checking email and looking at the internet when I should be working. In the library I can get an awful lot done in a couple of hours, but it can become quite sociable, which you have to watch out for. There are a lot of people you can pop out and have a coffee with.\" </p> <p>His next novel, which will be published in January, partly draws on his political experience. A love story set in contemporary Britain, it features a spin-doctor and \"a government not too dissimilar from the one in power at the moment\". On his past form, we can look forward to it at least making the shortlist of the literary prizes. Cartwright, though, is more wary. \"Winning the Whitbread was a very major thing for me. I'd always been well reviewed, but this made me widely read. It was a huge step up.

The day's sun refracted up off the face of the light chop in the bay. We were on our way to lunch. The Millbrook Inn lies in the hamlet of South Pool at the tip of one of the creeks that open into Salcombe Bay in Devon. You can get to it by car. But a car, what is a car when you can get there by boat? With a boat there's no back tracking along those narrow Devon lanes to let someone past.

The first essential is to get other people to do the work for you. To this end, at least one of them needs to be young and muscular and they must either be very fond of you or be well paid by you and be, overall, appreciated. And, it stands to reason, they must enjoy gardening, and you can initiate that. </p> <p>It would be best, of course, to be leading from the front, teaching by example, but that is hardly a relaxing exercise, even supposing that your stamina allowed it. </p> <p>There are certain times of the year and certain types of weather that make it far easier to slow down than at others. We are in one of the best right now and it will last for nearly a couple of months. Plant growth is slowing down. There is plenty of residual warmth and it is far easier to feel comfortable in the garden now than it was in spring. That is too exciting a season, change is rapid and needs to be accommodated, and there is a nasty sharpness in the air (be blowed to calling it bracing) that keeps you on the move or sends you scurrying for shelter. </p> <p> Keats's Ode To Autumn, his Season Of Mists And Mellow Fruitfulness, was written (near Winchester) at just about this moment. His long strophes characterise the languid satisfaction of enjoying the moment and doing nothing. Of just being aware of pleasant surroundings. Work is needed in order to create these, if they are to be in one's own garden, but that should be something to look back on, at this moment, or that should be going on when we have not yet emerged into the open air. \"I expect the pot plants will need watering, dear; they dry out much more quickly than one might expect. And, of course, the bird bath will need a clean before you fill that. And if you could dry the clothes somewhere out of sight, it does so improve the whole feel of the garden. The beans will want picking, of course, but you know all about that.\" </p> <p>There should be satisfactions to any craving scattered through the garden. A Victora plum will be welcome just now. And a fig tree. You may need to get someone to fix bags on them to save them from the birds. The best moment to do this, as you must patiently explain, is just as a fruit is starting to colour. It will then be ripe and ready for you to eat (with enticing longitudinal splits down the skin) just three days later, when the bags can be transferred to the next batch. A time-consuming chore, did I hear someone say? But just think of the resulting pleasure of gorging on one's own ripe figs. There'll probably be, if the job's well done, be more than I can eat myself. </p> <p>A wild blackberry, growing out of a boundary hedge, is always welcome, and we can stop anathematising them as beastly brambles until the crop is consumed. Autumn-fruiting raspberries are even better. For reasons known best to themselves, birds seem to have lost interest in them by now. The Japanese wineberry is fun. It has the growth of a loganberry, fruiting on last year's long canes. The fruits are clustered and very bright, shining red, but deep maroon by the time they are truly ripe. The flavour is unexciting but it is an excellent kiddies' fruit and it is easy to persuade yourself - or someone else - that they taste nice. </p> <p>A black mulberry tree is an asset, and you can spend hours, in the course of a week, pottering beneath its branches, while you select the blackest. So sharp, yet stimulating to the palate. We made a mulberry steamed pudding (suet crust) the other day, and in the course of five hours' steaming, the mulberry stalks just melt away and the suet crust becomes lovely and crumbly. </p> <p>In good soil, mulberries grow quickly and they crop from an early age. But they do need quite a lot of space and you can't sit under one after late July. Their staining abilities are unparalleled. Do, above all, make sure that it is the black mulberry that you are purchasing, not the white, which is a useless thing, unless you mean to keep silkworms. </p> <p>These are all attractions to visit in one's garden, but the garden's chief attraction is for sitting in and relaxing with champagne or some other sparkling wine, if it is morning (\"champagne is best drunk on a Sunday morning when others are in church\" an old friend, who died aged 99, use to say), or some stronger spirit in the evening, and good conversation with friends. </p> <p>But you want the sight of good things around you - dahlias, chrysanthemums and fuchsias are obvious candidates. A pear tree with windfalls beneath it ('Williams' is ideal for this) and Red Admiral and Comma butterflies battening on the rotting flesh, is relaxing to see. Scents are even more important, additional to the aroma of the next meal drifting out from the kitchen. My first favourite, to have near where we sit out, is the common myrtle, Myrtus communis. Both sweet and spicy. And there should be a sweet briar, Rosa rubiginosa, at hand, smelling of stewed apples. Laugh and grow fat, is a good old saying.</p>",

Lorry owners from France's leading road hauliers' federation, the FNTR, refused to follow their leaders' call yesterday afternoon to end the blockade, which has closed 14,000 of the country's 17,000 petrol stations and caused severe disruption. A second big haulage federation, Unostra, went further, asking its members not to abandon the hundreds of roadblocks or some 110 refinery and fuel depot barricades being manned around France. Providing a crumb of comfort for the embattled government, taxi drivers who had demonstrated en masse on Thursday appeared satisfied with a separate deal wrested from the interior ministry that allowed them to raise the price of a ride by nearly 5% and thus pass on their higher fuel costs to passengers. Coach operators also reached an agree ment with the government and ended their protest. But their place in the growing queue of demonstrators was immediately taken by driving schools, roadside recovery firms and even private refuse contractors, who yesterday took part in massed go-slow processions or mounted barricades on city approach roads around the country. The farmers' union, FNSEA, also stepped up its contribution to the campaign, closing railway lines and blocking major road junctions with tractors and promising to take over on the front line of some 110 oil refinery and fuel depot barricades should the hauliers reach a settlement. \"We are not being listened to at all,\" said the union's president, Luc Guyau. \"The government has failed to come up with even a partially satisfactory short-term solution and we stand by our demand for the abolition of state fuel taxes for the agricultural sector.\" While French farmers lifted their blockade of the Channel tunnel yesterday, the British transport minister, Lord Macdonald, criticised protesting British farmers and lorry drivers who yesterday targeted an oil refinery and a motorway. \"People have the right to a peaceful demonstration,\" he said, \"but they don't have the right to interrupt the vital supplies in the country, or put the livelihood and convenience of other people at risk.\" The demonstrators cut off distribution for several hours from a Shell plant in Merseyside and disrupted traffic on the A1 at Gateshead. Police warned them that their planned blockage of the road would be against the law. The protesters arrived at the sprawling Stanlow site near Ellesmere Port on Thursday night after an impromptu meeting at St Asaph's livestock market in north Wales. A Shell spokesman said their business had been effectively shut down for 14 hours and retailers were suffering as a result. \"When the protest first took place we took steps to ensure facilities such as hospitals were adequately supplied,\" said a company spokesman. \"But the longer it goes on the worse it is going to get.\" An estimated 1.8m litres of petrol in 60 tankers was unable to leave the site because of the blockade.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, when Gordon Brown announced that he was going to continue the Conservatives' strategy of hitting motorists with above-inflation increases in fuel duties, he claimed drivers' pain would be the environment's gain. The theory was that by increasing the costs of filling up at the pump, the Treasury would persuade drivers to leave the wheels at home and take public transport or walk thus decreasing Britain's emissions of greenhouse gases. In fact, Labour's decision to increase the escalator on fuel duties to 6% over inflation owed more to the gaping government deficit which they had inherited from the Conservatives than to environmental considerations. Revenues from petrol taxes bring a healthy \u00a322bn a year to the Treasury coffers. When Mr Brown scrapped the escalator last year, opting to increase fuel duties only by inflation, he deprived the Treasury of \u00a32bn in revenues. As a result of the rapid increase in duties since Norman Lamont introduced the fuel escalator seven years ago, taxes now account for almost 80% of the cost of a litre of petrol in the UK, the highest proportion in Europe. But while a welcome largesse for the Treasury, there is scant evidence that higher fuel costs are putting people off driving. Independent researchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimate that a 10% hike in the cost of driving would reduce the number of miles by less than 5%. \"This is not a very large response, which suggests that any attempt to reduce reliance on the car by increasing the cost of fuel will not have been very successful,\" the researchers note. The evidence from the UK certainly bears this out. The annual number of miles driven has risen each year since the introduction of escalator, despite rising petrol costs. In 1990 British drivers clocked up a total of 253bn miles between them. Ten years later this had risen by 12% to 284bn. The real gripe of the green lobby over fuel taxes is that instead of spending the proceeds on researching more environmentally friendly sources of energy or into public transport, it disappears into the Treasury's clutches. Motoring organisations argue that if fuel taxes must be levied then, the proceeds ought to be spent on tackling congestion on the roads and improving local transport links. Last year for the first time, Mr Brown broke with the Treasury's long-standing objection to hypothecating tax revenues, announcing that in future, any above inflation increases in fuel duties will be ringfenced for public transport spending. However, the backlash against higher petrol costs brought about by rising crude oil prices means that Mr Brown is unlikely to risk future above-inflation hikes in petrol duties.",

Not only does he have to pay more for his vet's bills but the cost of other basics, such as fertiliser and meal for the animals, has risen as a direct result of the fuel price rises.</p> <p>Mr Williams has not made a profit in four years and is existing only with the grace of his bank. It now costs him an extra \u00a380 a month to run his tractors - the red diesel which powers them has increased from 14.9 pence a litre in May to 23.9 pence.</p> <p>He spent a whole day and night blockading Shell's oil distribution refinery at Stanlow, Cheshire. \"I have been up since 5am on Thursday and I am only here because I want the government to revoke this unfair tax on fuel,\" he said yesterday.</p> <p>\"We are not here to mimic the French farmers - that is not our ambition - we just want the government to take action. The reason they are not interested is because farmers only form 2% of the electorate - perhaps this will change if we involve more people.\"</p> <p>Philip Robinson, a dairy, beef and sheep farmer from Nannerch, near Mold, said the farmers felt they were being kicked by the government when they were at their lowest ebb.</p> <p>\"Fuel prices are like the final nail in the coffin for farmers,\" he said. \"Our profit margins have already been cut back to the bone. Everything comes down to fuel prices in the end and it affects us in so many ways. We have had so many crises in farming, but this has put the top hat on it for us.\"</p> <p>Mr Williams is the vice-chairman of the Farmers' Union of Wales and the organiser of the blockade. At its height, around 150 protesters from north Wales and the north-west blockaded the oil distribution terminal throughout Thursday night.</p> <p>Yesterday afternoon, the numbers at the Shell plant had dwindled to around 40 farmers and hauliers at entrance number two, but more sup porters were expected to arrive over the weekend.</p> <p>The site, which covers four square miles, dominates the surrounding flat Cheshire countryside. It is scarred by huge steel pipes, storage containers, chimneys and the constantly flickering flame of a flare system which burns excess gas. Burning oil and petrol smells linger in the air.</p> <p>On Thursday night, the protesters arrived at the plant after an emotional meeting of farmers at St Asaph market in north Wales. Having decided to barricade the plant, three tractors were used to block the tankers' entrance and stop them entering or leaving.</p> <p>At 4am, the tractors were finally moved after police reinforcements arrived and told the farmers that under section 241 of the 1992 trade union and labour relations act they had to move or be arrested.</p> <p>Within 10 minutes, the immediate area was cleared. But 60 of Shell's tankers - capable of carrying 30,000 litres of fuel each - remained behind the wire fences yesterday as company officials decided it was not safe for them to drive past the remains of the blockade.</p> <p>Just one Shell tanker was allowed through when the dri ver showed protesters documents proving he was delivering fuel for ambulances.</p> <p>Tankers belonging to other petrol companies were allowed through. The farmers and hauliers looked on in disgust. Officials at Shell admitted that the protest had begun to affect its petrol stations in the north-west, parts of Yorkshire and up to the borders.</p> <p>The protesters said they were pleased that petrol stations in the area would soon begin to run out of fuel.</p> <p>\"It is sad for the general public who will feel the effect in the long run,\" said one farmer. \"But at the end of the day it is the government we are angry with and we just hope that people will support us.\"</p> <p>People from the nearby village of Elton were clearly supportive of the farmers. One woman dropped off a carrier bag full of biscuits for the campaigners. Later a box of soft drinks was donated by a villager.</p> <p>Many passing cars sounded their horns in support and some drivers raised their fists in a show of encouragement. A lorry with: \"Fair play its time to stop screwing us\" drove past to cheers.</p> <p>The protesters, however, are vowing to stay put until the government takes action to reduce tax on fuel.</p> <p>As the protest continued, around 20 hauliers' lorries and dozens of cars were parked on the private road leading up to the oil refinery. Police cordoned off the area to prevent traffic jams building up. Around 50 police officers from Cheshire police patrolled the area.</p> <p>One lorry driver drove past sounding his horn and carrying a sign on the back of his lorry: \"This is only the start of things to come, so give in now Mr Blair.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links about the French protests</b></p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.unostra.com\" target=\"_new\">French haulier's association</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.eurotunnel.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Eurotunnel</a></p>",

The reason they are not interested is because farmers only form 2% of the electorate - perhaps this will change if we involve more people.\" Philip Robinson, a dairy, beef and sheep farmer from Nannerch, near Mold, said the farmers felt they were being kicked by the government when they were at their lowest ebb. \"Fuel prices are like the final nail in the coffin for farmers,\" he said. \"Our profit margins have already been cut back to the bone. Everything comes down to fuel prices in the end and it affects us in so many ways. We have had so many crises in farming, but this has put the top hat on it for us.\" Mr Williams is the vice-chairman of the Farmers' Union of Wales and the organiser of the blockade. At its height, around 150 protesters from north Wales and the north-west blockaded the oil distribution terminal throughout Thursday night. Yesterday afternoon, the numbers at the Shell plant had dwindled to around 40 farmers and hauliers at entrance number two, but more sup porters were expected to arrive over the weekend. The site, which covers four square miles, dominates the surrounding flat Cheshire countryside. It is scarred by huge steel pipes, storage containers, chimneys and the constantly flickering flame of a flare system which burns excess gas. Burning oil and petrol smells linger in the air. On Thursday night, the protesters arrived at the plant after an emotional meeting of farmers at St Asaph market in north Wales. Having decided to barricade the plant, three tractors were used to block the tankers' entrance and stop them entering or leaving. At 4am, the tractors were finally moved after police reinforcements arrived and told the farmers that under section 241 of the 1992 trade union and labour relations act they had to move or be arrested. Within 10 minutes, the immediate area was cleared. But 60 of Shell's tankers - capable of carrying 30,000 litres of fuel each - remained behind the wire fences yesterday as company officials decided it was not safe for them to drive past the remains of the blockade. Just one Shell tanker was allowed through when the dri ver showed protesters documents proving he was delivering fuel for ambulances. Tankers belonging to other petrol companies were allowed through. The farmers and hauliers looked on in disgust. Officials at Shell admitted that the protest had begun to affect its petrol stations in the north-west, parts of Yorkshire and up to the borders. The protesters said they were pleased that petrol stations in the area would soon begin to run out of fuel. \"It is sad for the general public who will feel the effect in the long run,\" said one farmer. \"But at the end of the day it is the government we are angry with and we just hope that people will support us.\" People from the nearby village of Elton were clearly supportive of the farmers. One woman dropped off a carrier bag full of biscuits for the campaigners. Later a box of soft drinks was donated by a villager. Many passing cars sounded their horns in support and some drivers raised their fists in a show of encouragement. A lorry with: \"Fair play its time to stop screwing us\" drove past to cheers. The protesters, however, are vowing to stay put until the government takes action to reduce tax on fuel. As the protest continued, around 20 hauliers' lorries and dozens of cars were parked on the private road leading up to the oil refinery. Police cordoned off the area to prevent traffic jams building up. Around 50 police officers from Cheshire police patrolled the area. One lorry driver drove past sounding his horn and carrying a sign on the back of his lorry: \"This is only the start of things to come, so give in now Mr Blair.\" Useful links about the French protests French haulier's association Eurotunnel",

During that time they'll learn the fundamental science of earth and ecological systems, examining how science is used, not used or misued in human management of ecosystems. They'll be given a chance to apply lessons learned from the Biosphere 2 and regional case studies to the question of how people can better approach environmental problems on a global scale. They'll also complete a semester-long independent project. Volvo already runs successful environmental scholarships for American students at Biosphere 2, but the company is keen to make it an international scholarship - Antonia and Ben are the first outside the US to be admitted. \"Being a Volvo Environmental Scholar means becoming an ambassador for proactive environmental action,\" says John Pitts, Volvo's environmental manager. We'll keep you posted with Antonia and Ben's news from the Biosphere 2, but watch out for details of next year's scholarships when it could be your turn to help save the world.",

      "body": "<p>My great-uncle Alfred Hollis was in his early 40s when he died; he was a bachelor and had never worked. According to my aunt, he was always dressed beautifully, quite beyond his means. In the only photograph I have of him, he is sporting a rakishly angled wide-brimmed hat with a feather in its band, a high, stiff collar, a waistcoat and a long jacket. He is leaning his hip elegantly against his stick and holds a cigarette in his left hand. Parkland stretches behind him. He has written on the picture: \"The one and only... I took this 15 years ago.\" </p> <p>In the winter of 1938-39, Alfred visited the south of France with his sister Amelia and her husband Albert Emery, my maternal grandparents. Amelia wrote in her diary in January 1939 that they were \"nicely settled in a charming hotel on the promenade of Cap Martin... the beautiful blue sea under my window and oranges and lemons growing along the streets\". She described the distractions of the resort, in particular the casinos, and her \"great difficulty\" in stopping \"my husband in trying to break the bank\". Alfred may also have enjoyed the nightlife, but his main aim must have been to improve his health, or perhaps just to die in a pleasant place. He had spent much of his adult life in Ware Park sanatorium in Hertfordshire. Nine of his siblings had died of TB, in infancy or childhood. Now he seemed likely to follow; he was already so weak that, to his great chagrin, he had to wear a leather and steel surgical corset. </p> <p>I have been told different stories about his death on January 28, 1939. My mother maintained that he died in a sanatorium near Menton. My aunt, on the other hand, remembers being told that, coming down for dinner, my grandmother found her brother sitting in an armchair in the hotel lounge with a martini in his hand, a small drop of blood on his closed lips the only indication of death. Amelia and Albert stayed on to arrange the funeral and burial in the hilltop cemetery of Roquebrune, above Menton. They chose a grave plot, the lease on which, according to the usual practice in France, had to be renewed after 10 years. </p> <p>WB Yeats died in Cap Martin on the same day. His family chose the same sort of plot; the two men were buried alongside each other and their graves marked by plain white marble slabs bearing just their names and dates. Family photographs show both graves strewn with wreaths and flowers and Alfred's headstone has an ornate wire frame fixed behind it, covered with more flowers. Amelia and Albert were the only mourners at Alfred's funeral on January 30 1939. According to the Paris correspondent of the Times, those at Yeats's graveside included \"Mrs Yeats, Mr Dermod O'Brien, the President of the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts, and Lady Gerald Wellesley, the poetess\". </p> <p>In February 1947, my grandparents again made the trip to the south of France, accompanied this time by their teenage daughters. My mother recalled her intense excitement, and the ivory-framed sunglasses and frocks bought for the trip. In one of her daily letters to my father, she described their visit to the cemetery at Roquebrune. All the graves in the part of the cemetery where Alfred was buried had disappeared. Although they went to the local officials and the priest, they couldn't find any trace of his grave and no one knew or would say what had happened to his remains. </p> <p>The explanation given to my distraught grandmother was that there had been fighting around Roquebrune and that, in the confusion, all burial records had been lost. The family was determined to discover what had happened to Alfred's body. \"I must say if ever my husband said he would do a thing,\" my grandmother wrote in her diary, \"he would do it and I have never known him to let me down.\" </p> <p>In the Times of January 6 1948, my grandfather read that Yeats's \"last wish\", expressed to his wife, was that his remains be returned to Ireland for reburial in Drumcliffe churchyard, County Sligo, where he had \"spent his early days and where his father lived and his great-grandfather was once rector\". Arrangements for the exhumation were being made, according to the Sligo corporation and its mayor, AJ Dolan. How was this possible? The Yeats family must have known that the graves had been destroyed during the war. Or did they know something my grandfather didn't? Alternatively, were the authorities trying to cover up the fact that the graves had been destroyed? </p> <p>Albert wrote to Yeats's son, Michael. His letter has not survived but the reply has. It is a kind letter, and Yeats agrees with Albert that \"the position with regard to the cemetery at Roquebrune would appear to be more than a little confused\". He had not been to Roquebrune himself, but says that he was told that the disturbed remains were removed to an unmarked corner of the cemetery. \"In the case of my father certainly, and probably also in the case of your brother-in-law, the concession given was a 10-year one, and should not therefore have expired until early next year.</p> <p> But it would seem that during the war, changes occurred in the administration of Roquebrune cemetery, and conditions were for a time much disturbed - you will remember that fighting took place in and around Roquebrune... they have clearly made a mistake as regards the time for which certain of the concessions were granted. As far as the remains of my father are concerned, they have been traced and are now lying in a vault ready to be taken home as soon as transport can be arranged. But you will understand that the circumstances in this case were exceptional.\" </p> <p>Albert was unhappy with the response. He hadn't seen any unmarked graves in the cemetery. And, more disturbing, he had read in the press that the body waiting to go to Ireland was said by a French doctor to have been encased in a steel and leather surgical corset. </p> <p>The arrangements for Yeats's reburial continued. On August 20, the Times reported that in two days' time the corvette Macha would leave Cork for Dublin, and that Sean MacBride, the minister for external affairs, would join the ship on its journey to Villefranche, where the casket said to contain the poet's remains would be collected. The Macha would then return to Sligo Bay, where a state funeral was being arranged. </p> <p>The Times correspondent at Marseille reported that the casket had been collected on September 6 in the presence of Sean Murphy, the Irish government's representative in Paris, M Haag, prefect of the Alpes Maritimes, and a detachment of French troops. The next report says that the remains were interred on September 17 in Drumcliffe churchyard, after first lying in state at Sligo town hall. Picture Post added that the Yeats family had wanted a quiet ceremony but the government had insisted on a state funeral with full honours. </p> <p>The Times didn't mention that there was some doubt about who was buried in Drumcliffe, but my grandfather's questions were echoed in the Picture Post of October 9 1948. John Ormond Thomas, a staff journalist, had made inquiries at Roquebrune and \"despite close questioning and examination of all the people who should have been able to produce conclusive proof\", he was \"still not convinced\" of the identity of the body in the casket. Local officials at first denied that Yeats had ever been buried there, and later told him that they had discovered that the death had been entered in the register under the name \"William Butler\". </p> <p> They wouldn't let him see the register and didn't seem to understand how important Yeats was. Thomas was also shown two different plots where Yeats was supposed to have been buried, one by the sexton, who had not been present at the exhumation, and another by the undertaker. The first plot seemed to have been reused, although it was now empty; the date on the headstone was 1946. It didn't look like the grave shown in the photographs published in the Irish Times during the war. Thomas went to look at the casket, which stood in the chapel \"before a small altar that was covered with jampots that had once held flowers\" with a madonna and \"mildewing cherubs\" looking down from the damp walls.</p> <p> It was all very odd: the casket looked too new to have been in the earth for nine years, but the plaque on its lid was very tarnished. My grandfather wrote to Picture Post and received a reply from the assistant editor, EC Castle: \"What you say,\" he wrote, \"seems to justify the doubts which our staff journalist and photographer had when they started to ask questions about the grave at Roquebrune.\" On October 25, he heard from John Thomas, who said that the editor wanted to thank Albert for his letter and a subsequent visit he had made to their London office, but they had decided that \"it would be best for us not to pursue the matter further in Picture Post, if only out of respect for the Yeats family's feelings\". He enclosed an office memo: </p> <p> Dr William Patrick Griffin, who is a Harley Street physician, says that he has definite proof that when the body of the Irish poet WB Yeats was brought home from abroad in 1948 and buried with great ceremony in Sligo, the coffin contained not WB Yeats but a man whom of all people the Irish thoroughly disliked. He knows the name but was unwilling to divulge it at this stage. He would like to discuss the matter, and terms, with someone. He understands that we pay generously for exclusives. I told him we would ring him. </p> <p>This note is typed on unheaded paper, although an address, 530 Fulham Pal. Rd SW8, is scrawled on the bottom. Nothing more is known about Griffin's claims - my great-uncle appears to have had no connection with Ireland - but they make clear that others were aware of the doubt as to the identity of the body in Drumcliffe. </p> <p>My grandfather was also told by Picture Post that his activities were threatening relations between Ireland and France. Others agreed. Hugh McNally of the Daily Express wrote to Albert, saying that he had \"gone into the whole affair\" and had also decided not to \"publicise what had happened\". The warnings must have had a great effect on my grandfather: he didn't investigate the matter any further. </p> <p>Some of the confusion can perhaps be explained by a visit Yeats's last lover, Edith Shackleton, made to Roquebrune accompanied by the painter Gluck in the summer of 1947. This is what Gluck's biographer, Diana Souhami, reports: the two women, having searched in vain for Yeats's grave, questioned the local priest, Abb\u00e9 Biancheri, and Pierre Reynault, director of Maison Roblot, a firm of undertakers at Menton; they also visited Roquebrune town hall. </p> <p>They were told that Yeats had been buried in a \"fosse commune\", a pauper's grave, and that the site had long since been dug up and the bones placed in the communal ossuary. None of this tallies with either Michael Yeats's or my grandparents' account, and is belied by the photographs Albert took at the funeral. Biancheri did, however, speak to C\u00e9sar Lottier, the official responsible for exhumations and the maintenance of graves. He then wrote to Shackleton and Gluck saying that Lottier had only a vague memory of the exhumation, but that he thought a \"surgical truss circled with thin strips of steel\" had encased the body believed to be Yeats's. </p> <p>The women hurriedly consulted the artist Edmund Dulac, a close friend of Yeats's, who wrote to Biancheri on June 27 1947 imploring him not to let the matter go any further. The priest was asked to reveal nothing, no matter who came to question him, and to make sure that no one else said anything either. He was even asked to check the identity of any member of the Yeats family who visited the cemetery and, should anyone else ask questions, to say that his duties did not permit him to reveal the whereabouts of any grave. The abb\u00e9 agreed. </p> <p>When, three months later, Shackleton and Dulac read in the Times details of the arrangements for the poet's exhumation and reburial in Ireland, they wrote to his widow, George Yeats, told her what they had found out and tried to persuade her to abandon the plan. They didn't feel they could rely on the abb\u00e9's discretion and were worried that another body might be substituted for Yeats's to avoid a scandal. George Yeats contacted the French ambassador in Ireland and seems to have been content with his assurances that there would be no difficulty in returning her husband's remains. On March 31 1948, Abb\u00e9 Biancheri again wrote to Dulac saying that, though he himself had been unable to attend the exhumation on March 17, Reynault, Lottier, a police inspector from Paris, the mayor of Roquebrune and a nameless \"medical expert\" had all been present. A body now lay in a casket in the chapel of rest and, despite the doubts, would be taken to Drumcliffe churchyard. </p> <p>More than 20 years later, in the early 1970s, John Ormond Thomas, now working for the BBC in Cardiff, arrived at my mother's house wanting to speak to my grandmother. He was trying to trace the mysterious and avaricious Harley Street physician. He must have failed for nothing more was said until Souhami's book was published. </p> <p>In October 1988, the Independent and the Irish Times carried a letter from Michael and Anne Yeats disputing Souhami's suggestion that their father had been buried in a pauper's grave. Their mother, they said, was an \"extremely able and efficient woman, speaking excellent French\" and would never have made such a mistake \"on a matter of such crucial importance\". </p> <p>\"In preparation for the ultimate transfer to Ireland, the remains were exhumed in March 1948 and placed in a chapel of rest. Careful measurements were made of the remains... and the task of certification was made easier by the fact that due to a long-term hernia problem, our father wore a truss. The exhumation took place in full conformity with the rigorous French laws on these matters, and in the presence of the mayor of Roquebrune, senior police officials, a medical expert, the superintendent of graves and other persons of official and expert standing.\" </p> <p>They were, they said, \"satisfied beyond doubt\" that there had been no confusion. My mother's reply was printed a few days later. \"Amongst my family,\" she wrote, \"it is the belief that the body which lies in Drumcliffe cemetery is that of my mother's brother, Alfred George Hollis. My family, including myself, went to Roquebrune in 1947 and found that the bodies of my uncle and of WB Yeats had been exhumed, and on a search of the cemetery neither grave was found. Investigations by journalists discovered that identification of the body sent to Ireland rested on it being encased in a steel corset such as my uncle wore, and was buried in, as his frame was bent double by disease. My father exchanged letters with Michael Yeats explaining this, but the matter was dropped because of distress caused to both families.\" </p> <p>When I was a child this story was part of the romantic mystery of my mother's girlhood. But her recent death made me more curious. Discovering things about her life has meant uncovering the lives of those she was close to and sometimes those she never met. </p> <p>As Yeats himself once wrote: </p> <p> Though grave-diggers' toil is long,</p> <p>Sharp their spades, their muscles strong, </p> <p>They but thrust their buried men </p> <p>Back in the human mind again. </p> <p> \u0095 This is an edited version of an article that first appeared in the London Review of Books.

The family was determined to discover what had happened to Alfred's body. \"I must say if ever my husband said he would do a thing,\" my grandmother wrote in her diary, \"he would do it and I have never known him to let me down.\" In the Times of January 6 1948, my grandfather read that Yeats's \"last wish\", expressed to his wife, was that his remains be returned to Ireland for reburial in Drumcliffe churchyard, County Sligo, where he had \"spent his early days and where his father lived and his great-grandfather was once rector\". Arrangements for the exhumation were being made, according to the Sligo corporation and its mayor, AJ Dolan. How was this possible? The Yeats family must have known that the graves had been destroyed during the war. Or did they know something my grandfather didn't? Alternatively, were the authorities trying to cover up the fact that the graves had been destroyed? Albert wrote to Yeats's son, Michael. His letter has not survived but the reply has. It is a kind letter, and Yeats agrees with Albert that \"the position with regard to the cemetery at Roquebrune would appear to be more than a little confused\". He had not been to Roquebrune himself, but says that he was told that the disturbed remains were removed to an unmarked corner of the cemetery. \"In the case of my father certainly, and probably also in the case of your brother-in-law, the concession given was a 10-year one, and should not therefore have expired until early next year. But it would seem that during the war, changes occurred in the administration of Roquebrune cemetery, and conditions were for a time much disturbed - you will remember that fighting took place in and around Roquebrune... they have clearly made a mistake as regards the time for which certain of the concessions were granted. As far as the remains of my father are concerned, they have been traced and are now lying in a vault ready to be taken home as soon as transport can be arranged. But you will understand that the circumstances in this case were exceptional.\" Albert was unhappy with the response. He hadn't seen any unmarked graves in the cemetery. And, more disturbing, he had read in the press that the body waiting to go to Ireland was said by a French doctor to have been encased in a steel and leather surgical corset. The arrangements for Yeats's reburial continued. On August 20, the Times reported that in two days' time the corvette Macha would leave Cork for Dublin, and that Sean MacBride, the minister for external affairs, would join the ship on its journey to Villefranche, where the casket said to contain the poet's remains would be collected. The Macha would then return to Sligo Bay, where a state funeral was being arranged. The Times correspondent at Marseille reported that the casket had been collected on September 6 in the presence of Sean Murphy, the Irish government's representative in Paris, M Haag, prefect of the Alpes Maritimes, and a detachment of French troops. The next report says that the remains were interred on September 17 in Drumcliffe churchyard, after first lying in state at Sligo town hall. Picture Post added that the Yeats family had wanted a quiet ceremony but the government had insisted on a state funeral with full honours. The Times didn't mention that there was some doubt about who was buried in Drumcliffe, but my grandfather's questions were echoed in the Picture Post of October 9 1948. John Ormond Thomas, a staff journalist, had made inquiries at Roquebrune and \"despite close questioning and examination of all the people who should have been able to produce conclusive proof\", he was \"still not convinced\" of the identity of the body in the casket. Local officials at first denied that Yeats had ever been buried there, and later told him that they had discovered that the death had been entered in the register under the name \"William Butler\". They wouldn't let him see the register and didn't seem to understand how important Yeats was. Thomas was also shown two different plots where Yeats was supposed to have been buried, one by the sexton, who had not been present at the exhumation, and another by the undertaker. The first plot seemed to have been reused, although it was now empty; the date on the headstone was 1946. It didn't look like the grave shown in the photographs published in the Irish Times during the war. Thomas went to look at the casket, which stood in the chapel \"before a small altar that was covered with jampots that had once held flowers\" with a madonna and \"mildewing cherubs\" looking down from the damp walls. It was all very odd: the casket looked too new to have been in the earth for nine years, but the plaque on its lid was very tarnished. My grandfather wrote to Picture Post and received a reply from the assistant editor, EC Castle: \"What you say,\" he wrote, \"seems to justify the doubts which our staff journalist and photographer had when they started to ask questions about the grave at Roquebrune.\" On October 25, he heard from John Thomas, who said that the editor wanted to thank Albert for his letter and a subsequent visit he had made to their London office, but they had decided that \"it would be best for us not to pursue the matter further in Picture Post, if only out of respect for the Yeats family's feelings\". He enclosed an office memo: Dr William Patrick Griffin, who is a Harley Street physician, says that he has definite proof that when the body of the Irish poet WB Yeats was brought home from abroad in 1948 and buried with great ceremony in Sligo, the coffin contained not WB Yeats but a man whom of all people the Irish thoroughly disliked. He knows the name but was unwilling to divulge it at this stage. He would like to discuss the matter, and terms, with someone. He understands that we pay generously for exclusives. I told him we would ring him. This note is typed on unheaded paper, although an address, 530 Fulham Pal. Rd SW8, is scrawled on the bottom. Nothing more is known about Griffin's claims - my great-uncle appears to have had no connection with Ireland - but they make clear that others were aware of the doubt as to the identity of the body in Drumcliffe. My grandfather was also told by Picture Post that his activities were threatening relations between Ireland and France. Others agreed. Hugh McNally of the Daily Express wrote to Albert, saying that he had \"gone into the whole affair\" and had also decided not to \"publicise what had happened\". The warnings must have had a great effect on my grandfather: he didn't investigate the matter any further. Some of the confusion can perhaps be explained by a visit Yeats's last lover, Edith Shackleton, made to Roquebrune accompanied by the painter Gluck in the summer of 1947. This is what Gluck's biographer, Diana Souhami, reports: the two women, having searched in vain for Yeats's grave, questioned the local priest, Abb\u00e9 Biancheri, and Pierre Reynault, director of Maison Roblot, a firm of undertakers at Menton; they also visited Roquebrune town hall. They were told that Yeats had been buried in a \"fosse commune\", a pauper's grave, and that the site had long since been dug up and the bones placed in the communal ossuary. None of this tallies with either Michael Yeats's or my grandparents' account, and is belied by the photographs Albert took at the funeral. Biancheri did, however, speak to C\u00e9sar Lottier, the official responsible for exhumations and the maintenance of graves. He then wrote to Shackleton and Gluck saying that Lottier had only a vague memory of the exhumation, but that he thought a \"surgical truss circled with thin strips of steel\" had encased the body believed to be Yeats's. The women hurriedly consulted the artist Edmund Dulac, a close friend of Yeats's, who wrote to Biancheri on June 27 1947 imploring him not to let the matter go any further. The priest was asked to reveal nothing, no matter who came to question him, and to make sure that no one else said anything either. He was even asked to check the identity of any member of the Yeats family who visited the cemetery and, should anyone else ask questions, to say that his duties did not permit him to reveal the whereabouts of any grave. The abb\u00e9 agreed. When, three months later, Shackleton and Dulac read in the Times details of the arrangements for the poet's exhumation and reburial in Ireland, they wrote to his widow, George Yeats, told her what they had found out and tried to persuade her to abandon the plan. They didn't feel they could rely on the abb\u00e9's discretion and were worried that another body might be substituted for Yeats's to avoid a scandal. George Yeats contacted the French ambassador in Ireland and seems to have been content with his assurances that there would be no difficulty in returning her husband's remains. On March 31 1948, Abb\u00e9 Biancheri again wrote to Dulac saying that, though he himself had been unable to attend the exhumation on March 17, Reynault, Lottier, a police inspector from Paris, the mayor of Roquebrune and a nameless \"medical expert\" had all been present. A body now lay in a casket in the chapel of rest and, despite the doubts, would be taken to Drumcliffe churchyard. More than 20 years later, in the early 1970s, John Ormond Thomas, now working for the BBC in Cardiff, arrived at my mother's house wanting to speak to my grandmother. He was trying to trace the mysterious and avaricious Harley Street physician. He must have failed for nothing more was said until Souhami's book was published. In October 1988, the Independent and the Irish Times carried a letter from Michael and Anne Yeats disputing Souhami's suggestion that their father had been buried in a pauper's grave. Their mother, they said, was an \"extremely able and efficient woman, speaking excellent French\" and would never have made such a mistake \"on a matter of such crucial importance\". \"In preparation for the ultimate transfer to Ireland, the remains were exhumed in March 1948 and placed in a chapel of rest. Careful measurements were made of the remains... and the task of certification was made easier by the fact that due to a long-term hernia problem, our father wore a truss. The exhumation took place in full conformity with the rigorous French laws on these matters, and in the presence of the mayor of Roquebrune, senior police officials, a medical expert, the superintendent of graves and other persons of official and expert standing.\" They were, they said, \"satisfied beyond doubt\" that there had been no confusion. My mother's reply was printed a few days later. \"Amongst my family,\" she wrote, \"it is the belief that the body which lies in Drumcliffe cemetery is that of my mother's brother, Alfred George Hollis. My family, including myself, went to Roquebrune in 1947 and found that the bodies of my uncle and of WB Yeats had been exhumed, and on a search of the cemetery neither grave was found. Investigations by journalists discovered that identification of the body sent to Ireland rested on it being encased in a steel corset such as my uncle wore, and was buried in, as his frame was bent double by disease. My father exchanged letters with Michael Yeats explaining this, but the matter was dropped because of distress caused to both families.\" When I was a child this story was part of the romantic mystery of my mother's girlhood. But her recent death made me more curious. Discovering things about her life has meant uncovering the lives of those she was close to and sometimes those she never met. As Yeats himself once wrote: Though grave-diggers' toil is long, Sharp their spades, their muscles strong, They but thrust their buried men Back in the human mind again. \u0095 This is an edited version of an article that first appeared in the London Review of Books.

      "body": "<p><strong> Super-Cannes</strong></p> <p> JG Ballard </p> <p>392pp, Flamingo, \u00a316.99 <br></p> <p> It is tempting to see Ballard as the seer of Shepperton, the self-styled suburbanite who carves out grim dystopias of technology, corruption and perversion from the safety of the sofa. Or indeed as the child internee of Empire of the Sun, who transforms every social space into a prison in which savagery is the necessary corollary to survival. Neither of these descriptions is particularly untrue, but in Super-Cannes - in many ways a companion piece to Ballard's previous novel, Cocaine Nights - we might identify the author of other kinds of fiction, the detective novel, the tender travelogue and the supremely subtle parody also jostling for attention. </p> <p>The hero of Super-Cannes is a typically Ballardesque character, the ex-RAF pilot who finds himself cut asunder from modern life and stands on the sidelines patiently attempting to unravel its message and find the key to his own alienation. But the novel also has a powerful anti-hero, the sick psychiatrist Wilder Penrose, whose description on the first page as an \"amiable Prospero\" fits his creator equally well. Penrose is the Lord of Misrule who presides over his territory with unnerving sang-froid, winding up his charges then fondly regarding the havoc they create. </p> <p>Penrose's \"ideas laboratory for the new millennium\" is the grandly named Eden-Olympia, a monstrously hi-tech business park nestling in the hills above the French Riviera which plays home to the new elites. Here, absorption in work has eclipsed the need for play, and the ornamental ponds, sports centres and cafes that landscape the complex stand deserted as the executives of Siemens, Mitsui and Unilever move silently from glass-fronted office buildings to sleek chauffeur-driven cars. Social life, in its broadest sense, has been dispensed with, and there is no place among the smooth planes and surfaces for the church, the council house or the police station. Monitored by surveillance cameras and guarded by an under-employed security force, the community polices itself; all that matters is the quiet accretion of wealth and the dedicated pursuit of commerce. </p> <p>Into this capitalist paradise glides an antique Jaguar bearing Paul Sinclair - an aviation buff deprived of his pilot's licence and the use of a knee following a bungled take-off - and his wife Jane, a youthful paediatrician whose bolshieness and taste for the occasional recreational drug marks her out from the beginning as a character likely to end up in trouble. Indeed, their arrival - ushered in by a beaming Penrose - is already tainted; Jane is to replace David Greenwood, a clinician who some months earlier had rampaged through the cool green spaces and mirrored offices of Eden-Olympia, taken a rifle to 10 people and then slaughtered himself. Becalmed by the curse of enforced leisure - \"a new kind of social deprivation\" - and intrigued by the teasingly casual response of the business park's senior personnel, Paul sniffs conspiracy and turns sleuth. </p> <p>The remainder of the novel is vintage Ballard, a gripping blend of stylised thriller and fantastic imaginings rendered in deceptively bland, unruffled prose. One of its virtues lies simply in its compulsive readability; as the story unfolds, the reader is engaged at the level of pure plot, infected by Sinclair's quest to penetrate the mystery behind Greenwood's \"dance of death\". Yet Ballard's flair for the surreal and the sinister dictates that neither Sinclair nor the reader will remain untouched by the world they behold. For Sinclair, the process of collusion with the criminality that underlies life at Eden-Olympia begins early, with a cheery piece of vandalism on Penrose's car and a sexual fillip after his wife shoplifts a copy of Paris-Match. </p> <p>By the time he has uncovered the serious programme of violence designed by Penrose to counteract executive stress - a leather- jacketed \"bowling club\" whose forays into the outside world leave Arab pimps and Senegalese trinket merchants bleeding in the gutters - Sinclair is as compromised as he is appalled, and feels a reluctant admiration of the ruthless rationale behind the businessmen's therapeutic games.

      "bodyText": "Super-Cannes JG Ballard 392pp, Flamingo, \u00a316.99 It is tempting to see Ballard as the seer of Shepperton, the self-styled suburbanite who carves out grim dystopias of technology, corruption and perversion from the safety of the sofa. Or indeed as the child internee of Empire of the Sun, who transforms every social space into a prison in which savagery is the necessary corollary to survival. Neither of these descriptions is particularly untrue, but in Super-Cannes - in many ways a companion piece to Ballard's previous novel, Cocaine Nights - we might identify the author of other kinds of fiction, the detective novel, the tender travelogue and the supremely subtle parody also jostling for attention. The hero of Super-Cannes is a typically Ballardesque character, the ex-RAF pilot who finds himself cut asunder from modern life and stands on the sidelines patiently attempting to unravel its message and find the key to his own alienation. But the novel also has a powerful anti-hero, the sick psychiatrist Wilder Penrose, whose description on the first page as an \"amiable Prospero\" fits his creator equally well. Penrose is the Lord of Misrule who presides over his territory with unnerving sang-froid, winding up his charges then fondly regarding the havoc they create. Penrose's \"ideas laboratory for the new millennium\" is the grandly named Eden-Olympia, a monstrously hi-tech business park nestling in the hills above the French Riviera which plays home to the new elites. Here, absorption in work has eclipsed the need for play, and the ornamental ponds, sports centres and cafes that landscape the complex stand deserted as the executives of Siemens, Mitsui and Unilever move silently from glass-fronted office buildings to sleek chauffeur-driven cars. Social life, in its broadest sense, has been dispensed with, and there is no place among the smooth planes and surfaces for the church, the council house or the police station. Monitored by surveillance cameras and guarded by an under-employed security force, the community polices itself; all that matters is the quiet accretion of wealth and the dedicated pursuit of commerce. Into this capitalist paradise glides an antique Jaguar bearing Paul Sinclair - an aviation buff deprived of his pilot's licence and the use of a knee following a bungled take-off - and his wife Jane, a youthful paediatrician whose bolshieness and taste for the occasional recreational drug marks her out from the beginning as a character likely to end up in trouble. Indeed, their arrival - ushered in by a beaming Penrose - is already tainted; Jane is to replace David Greenwood, a clinician who some months earlier had rampaged through the cool green spaces and mirrored offices of Eden-Olympia, taken a rifle to 10 people and then slaughtered himself. Becalmed by the curse of enforced leisure - \"a new kind of social deprivation\" - and intrigued by the teasingly casual response of the business park's senior personnel, Paul sniffs conspiracy and turns sleuth. The remainder of the novel is vintage Ballard, a gripping blend of stylised thriller and fantastic imaginings rendered in deceptively bland, unruffled prose. One of its virtues lies simply in its compulsive readability; as the story unfolds, the reader is engaged at the level of pure plot, infected by Sinclair's quest to penetrate the mystery behind Greenwood's \"dance of death\". Yet Ballard's flair for the surreal and the sinister dictates that neither Sinclair nor the reader will remain untouched by the world they behold. For Sinclair, the process of collusion with the criminality that underlies life at Eden-Olympia begins early, with a cheery piece of vandalism on Penrose's car and a sexual fillip after his wife shoplifts a copy of Paris-Match. By the time he has uncovered the serious programme of violence designed by Penrose to counteract executive stress - a leather- jacketed \"bowling club\" whose forays into the outside world leave Arab pimps and Senegalese trinket merchants bleeding in the gutters - Sinclair is as compromised as he is appalled, and feels a reluctant admiration of the ruthless rationale behind the businessmen's therapeutic games. Pricked by his conscience yet drawn into the community's bizarre sexual games, Sinclair is caught in a double bind of resistance and attraction; seduced by the drama of what he witnesses he is unable, despite his instincts, to tear himself away. \"It's irritating to be reminded of the contingent world\", remarks Penrose as he outlines his plans for the \"intelligent city\" he is creating. At first sight, that intelligence takes the form of advanced health screening, up-to-the-minute gadgetry and the replacement of the civic by the commercial. But as the novel progresses, his vision is seen to be far more concerned with the accommodation and encouragement of baser instincts. \"A controlled psychopathy is a way of resocialising people and tribalising them into mutually supportive groups,\" he explains in defence of the violent \"special actions\" carried out by the bowling club. \"The consumer society hungers for the deviant and unexpected - psychopathy is the only engine powerful enough to light our imaginations, to drive the arts, sciences and industries of the world.\" All the best madmen make a certain kind of sense, and Penrose's development of homeopathic violence - \"microdoses of madness like the minute traces of strychnine in a nerve tonic\" - holds Eden-Olympia in a \"state of undeclared war\", its occupants beguiled into an inhuman and unnatural state of hyper-effectiveness.

If you think Palestinians have no right to a homeland, then Said's very existence must be an abomination. </p> <p>But it is not so much because of Palestine that you should read this book. It is simply a great autobiography: measured, penetrating, and exact. Said used to think about his childhood as a way to help himself fall asleep, but now \"this book in some fundamental way is all about sleeplessness, all about the silence of wakefulness\"; it is also all about recovering his early years after being diagnosed with leukaemia. </p> <p>What follows is a powerfully affecting evocation of his own past. For periods during this book I would conduct a kind of thought-experiment and imagine that it was not written by Edward W Said - the intellectual who with Orientalism almost singlehandedly redefined the way in which we look at literature, who trails clouds of academic glory and is surrounded by a loyal phalanx of lofty and well-regarded friends and colleagues - but by someone no one had ever heard of. Would it still merit publication? A silly and unanswerable question, perhaps, but one nevertheless answered by the fact that I was turning the pages avidly at the same time. </p> <p>His circumstances can hardly be said to be the kind that many readers in this country will identify with. He was brought up in a reasonably affluent Christian family, educated at a succession of pseudo-English public-school-type institutions and then a few American ones, with an extraordinary father and mother and a peripatetic existence shuttling across the Atlantic, beginning with the farewell to west Jerusalem in 1947, when it became impossible for the family to remain. Half of him is \"Edward\", named after the then Prince of Wales, the other half the Arabic \"Said\"; his allegiances were confused, tugged this way and that, or perhaps he had no allegiances at all - no wonder this memoir is called Out of Place. </p> <p>Perhaps it is its time-frame and this sense of dislocation, as well as its precision of tone, that makes it read something like Ballard's Empire of the Sun without the highly unusual backdrops. But just as that book was loved because there remained a child's vision that we could identify with, so there is much of Said's childhood and adolescence that we will recognise, too: the derelictions of duty, the rebukes, the sense of incomprehension and boredom. \"Years later, when I had become known as a literary critic, one classmate told another, who relayed the comment to me: 'Is that the same Said? . . . amazing that he turned out like that.'\" </p> <p>What makes the attack on Said in Commentary so mystifying is how anyone, on reading this book, could accuse Said of fibbing. To me, at least, it seems that every sentence is impregnated with honesty. Said was 12 when his family left Jerusalem, and he does not pretend to more than a 12-year-old's understanding of what was going on at the time.

Two of them - J K Rowling and Enid Blyton - feature on this list from Leamington Spa library. Interestingly, the colossus who came between them - Roald Dahl - does not. A quick look at the lending-rights charts for the whole of the UK would suggest that this is a local blip - maybe due to something as trivial as unreturned books.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We are in a rush. We are making haste. A compression of time characterises life today. Airport gates are minor intensifiers of the lose-not-a-minute anguish of our age. There are other intensifiers - places and objects that signify impatience. Certain notorious intersections and tollbooths. Doctors' anterooms (\"waiting\" rooms). The \"door close\" button in elevators, so often a placebo, with no function but to distract for a moment those riders to whom 10 seconds seems an eternity. Speed-dial buttons on telephones: do you invest minutes in programming them and reap your reward in tenths of a second? Remote controls: their very existence, in the hands of a quick-reflexed, multi-tasking, channel-flipping, fast-forwarding citizenry, has caused an acceleration in the pace of films and television commercials. </p> <p>We have a word for free time: leisure. Leisure is time off the books, off the job, off the clock. If we save time, we commonly believe we are saving it for our leisure. We know that leisure is really a state of mind, but no dictionary can define it without reference to passing time. It is unrestricted time, unemployed time, unoccupied time. </p> <p>Or is it? Unoccupied time is vanishing. The leisure industries (an oxymoron maybe, but no contradiction) fill time, as groundwater fills a sinkhole. The very variety of experience attacks our leisure as it attempts to satiate us. We work for our amusement. Five hundred channels became a watchword of the 90s even before, strictly speaking, it became a reality. It denotes too much to choose from. And not just channels: coffees, magazines and on-line 'zines, mustards and olive oils, celebrity perfumes and celebrity rumours, fissioning musical styles and digitised recordings of more different performances of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony than Beethoven could have heard in his lifetime. </p> <p>All humanity has not succumbed equally, of course. If you make haste, you probably make it in the technology-driven western world, possibly in a large city - including, certainly, the most prosperous cities of the United States, Europe and Asia. Sociologists in several countries have found that increasing wealth and increasing education bring a sense of tension about time. We believe that we possess too little of it: that is a myth we now live by. What is true is that we are awash in things, in information, in news, in the old rubble and shiny new toys of our complex civilisation, and - strange, perhaps - stuff means speed. </p> <p>The wave patterns of all these facts and choices flow and crash about us at a heightened frequency. We live in the buzz. We wish to live intensely, and we wonder about the consequences - whether, perhaps, we face the biological dilemma of the waterflea, whose heart beats faster as the temperature rises. This creature lives almost four months at 46 degrees Fahrenheit but less than one month at 82 degrees. </p> <p>\"Technology has been a rapid heartbeat, compressing housework, travel, entertainment, squeezing more and more into the allotted span,\" notes the social historian Theodore Zeldin. \"Nobody expected that it would create the feeling that life moves too fast.\"</p> <p>It has created exactly this feeling. The laziest among us have acquired a heightened awareness of time - by necessity. The modern economy lives and dies by precision in time's measurement and efficiency in its employment. If money is the visible currency of trade, time is its doppelg\u00e4nger, a coin over which companies and consumers battle, consciously or unconsciously, with ever-greater urgency. </p> <p>You probably notice most assaults on your wallet, but do you notice when a business makes a grab for a few extra seconds of your time? You may contemplate your losses while you wait in the serpentine line at the airport ticket counter or navigate a six-minute telephone queue that has replaced a human who might once have answered your question in a few seconds.</p> <p>In return, marketers and technologists anticipate your desires with fast ovens, quick playback, quick freezing, and fast credit. We bank the extra minutes that flow from these innovations, yet we feel impoverished and we cut back - on breakfast, on lunch, on sleep, on daydreams. Federal Express and McDonald's have created whole new segments of the economy by understanding, capitalising on - and then in their own ways fostering - our haste. \"Tired of working overtime?\" ask scores of advertisements. A medication is marketed \"for women who don't have time for a yeast infection\" - as though slackers might have time for that. </p> <p>The defining quality of haste is only now coming into focus in our cultural mirrors, as in the New Yorker cartoons: (1996) man getting into cab - \"And step on it. This restaurant may be over any minute\"; (1997) man speaking into telephone - \"No, I don't have four seconds to talk.\" Even Bill Gates, with his abundance of money, his private jet, and his fast cars, complains, \"It seems like the whole world operates in five-minute intervals.\"</p> <p>So who can escape their awareness of the pressure? Not the US chat-show host David Letterman. \"I'll try to be brief - we've done a lot of focus groups and people complain that I'm talking too much,\" he tells his Late Show audience. \"They say it delays the show.\"</p> <p>Pruning minutes and seconds and hundredths of seconds has become an obsession in all but a few segments of our society. In the spirit of Olympic swimmers shaving their chest hair, television networks are ever so delicately shaving the \"blacks\"-the punctuation marks between shows, when the screen fades momentarily to darkness. </p> <p>Yet we have made our choices and are still making them. We humans have chosen speed, and we thrive on it - more than we generally admit. Our ability to work fast and play fast gives us power. It thrills us. If we have learned the name of just one hormone, it is adrenaline. No wonder we call sudden exhilaration a rush. </p> <p>\"Your life is lived with the kind of excitement that your forebears knew only in battle,\" observes the writer Mark Helprin. And: \"They, unlike you, were the prisoner of mundane tasks. They wrote with pens, they did addition, they waited endlessly for things that come to you instantaneously, they had far less than you do, and they bowed to necessity, as you do not. You love the pace, the giddy, continual acceleration.\" Admit it - you do! </p> <p>Still, you have not truly explored the consequences of haste in our culture and in our daily lives. You hardly perceive the acceleration of art and entertainment: the changing pace of media from cinema to television commercials that reflect and condition a changing pace in our psyches. </p> <p>Instantaneity rules in the network and in our emotional lives: instant coffee, instant intimacy, instant replay, and instant gratification. Pollsters use electronic devices during political speeches to measure opinions on the wing, before they have been fully formed. Like missiles spawning mirvs, fast-food restaurants add express lanes. If we do not understand time, we become its victims.</p> <p>\"Time is a gentle deity,\" said Sophocles. Perhaps it was, for him. These days it cracks the whip.</p> <p> From an article titled Ten Tall Tales About Composting: \"A number of magazine ads have hoodwinked well-intentioned gardeners into thinking that they must produce compost in 14 days. Such expectations are unrealistic and unworthy. Decomposition takes time. While producing compost quickly has some merit, no one should feel compelled to purchase chipper-shredders or other elaborate equipment. In fact, even if material looks like compost after several weeks, it still requires an additional one-month maturation period before it should be used...\"</p> <p>You can't hurry compost for the same reason you can't hurry love and you can't hurry a souffl\u00e9. The biochemistry has its own inherent pace. That doesn't mean you won't try. You suspect, without even thinking about it, that any business called Dombey &amp; Sons, Trujillo &amp; Sons, Eubelhor &amp; Sons, or even Harvey &amp; Daughters must be a venerable business indeed. People are not founding companies today, as they once did, in hopes that their grandchildren will some day carry on the family tradition. No. Grandchildren take time.</p> <p>Nor does one buy deep-blue denim jeans with their dye stiff as tin, resigned to wearing them for a year before achieving a faded \"look\". One buys them prewashed, pre-faded, and maybe pre-patched at the knees or seat. Who can wait for nature to take its course? The traditional leather jacket, like a second skin after 10 years of wearing, was not actually comfortable in its first year. You had to make an investment. The attachment to old clothes is in the teddy-bear category, growing more from an emotional web of associations than from anything in the cloth. As our reflexes have certain speeds, so does our formation of memories, our accretion of nostalgia. So can the years of breaking-in be effectively bypassed?</p> <p>Apparently so, because a typical catalogue advertises the \"Been There Leather Jacket\": \"A jacket that (in former lives) has seen it all... There are legends and sagas in each ruck and crease of the distressed, heavy, full-grain cowhide.\" Naturally, it sports \"antiqued hardware\". In 1997, Disney advertised the film The Little Mermaid as \"the timeless classic\". Just eight years earlier it was a new movie. Is this, too, a way of straining against the limits of biology - this rapid would-be insertion of a new cultural icon into our store of classic memories? </p> <p>We humans used to feel like the laggards, with nature marching briskly onward. Time and tide wait for no man. \"In our day of electric wires,\" Mark Twain said, prematurely, \"... we turn it around. Man waits not for time nor tide.\"</p> <p>Some of biology is essentially a pause: sleep, for example. Pauses serve a purpose, breaking the flow. Like rests in music or caesuras in verse. Like the old nightly break in the news cycle and the financial markets, gone in our 24:7 era. Even a confirmed atheist and Sunday driver must believe that the Sabbath served a therapeutic purpose, too, in the epoch when people observed it. Now, of course, Puritanical \"blue\" laws (\"No woman shall kiss her child on Sabbath or fasting day\"!) are mostly long gone, and Federal Express boasts of delivering on Sunday \"because the world works seven days a week\". </p> <p>Haydn may have been the first great master of the rest in musical composition; he used rests for surprise, rests for tension, and even rests with fermatas. Silence indefinitely prolonged. Rest and pause. A rest with a fermata is the moral opposite of the fast-food restaurant with express lane. Modern conservatories find these strangely troubling for some students, who can play the most intricate polyrhythms find it difficult to give the rest its full value, let alone the vague extra time called for by the fermata. They just can't wait long enough.</p> <p>There are enforced pauses in the eating of pistachio nuts; pre-shelled pistachios are an expensive luxury - another fast food - and strangely disappointing. It is relevant that researchers in time-compressed speech, discovering hidden punctuation in the pauses that dot our conversation, found that intelligibility declines as the pauses are removed. For most of us, coffee breaks have gone the way of enforced Sabbaths, and neither transcendental meditation nor the sensory-deprivation tank seems likely to replace them.</p> <p> From a cosmic point of view, the velocity of human thought is more or less fixed - attuned in sometimes useful ways to the velocity of an apple falling from a tree, to the rate of the Earth's spin, to the leaping speed of a predatory coyote, to the gentle passing of the seasons, to the wavelengths of visible light and audible sound. We are defined by these velocities, among others. You could imagine species living on quite different timetables. In fact, you can see them: bumblebees or bristlecone pines, inhabiting temporal planes that barely intersect our own. Careful, though. Speed is not who you are.</p> <p>From a parochial point of view, we could concern ourselves with small variations in human speeds. We do make a sport out of comparative running speeds. If we were the sort of psychologists who like to be termed \"psychometricians\", we could pretend to make a science out of comparative thinking speeds. In athletic competition, technology has turned the briefest intervals into arenas for competition. The margins have become so fine that chance easily overcomes the talent that racers strive so hard to perfect. Gusts of wind, uneven turf, random differences in the lengths of swimming-pool lanes can all come into play. The millisecond has come into its own.</p> <p>Baseball, commonly said to be a game of inches, is revealed by the fastest modern cameras to be a game of milliseconds. The pivotal events occur in these tiny windows, testing umpires' reflexes. No ordinary hand-held stopwatch can resolve a millisecond; thus, until recently, a millisecond could not be the margin of victory in sports. Now it can. </p> <p>Luge is one of the events for which Olympic rules now allow a victory by mere milliseconds. Canoeing and bicycling are others. Millisecond-sensitivity breeds further dependence on technology. Swimmers clothe themselves in Teflon-coated microfibre suits. Bicyclists ride machines whose aerodynamic properties were honed in wind tunnels. For the sake of fairness, when the world's fastest sprinters line up for the 100-metre dash, the sound of the gun comes to them electronically, to protect against millisecond differences in the time of its arrival through the open breeze. Lasers shine on their backs to provide a continuous Doppler measurement of speed, acceleration, deceleration. And the finish line is monitored by filmless, computer-enhanced, digital cameras, splitting time with a precision beyond the reach of human senses.</p> <p>Carl Lewis, at his peak, occasionally lost 100-metre races that he had run faster than his competitors. His reaction time - the time it takes for the starting signal to translate through eardrum, brain, nerves and muscles - was generally mediocre, on the order of 140 milliseconds, compared with 115 to 120 milliseconds for the fastest starters. That one-fiftieth of a second difference now matters. It matters so much that reaction times are now regularly monitored. Officials declare a false start not only if a runner moves before the gun but also if a runner moves within a tenth of a second after the gun - because reaction times that fast are believed to be humanly impossible.</p> <p>So runners these days do not just practise running. They practise throwing precisely the optimal piece of torso across the invisible finish line demarcated by the hairline within the electronic camera. They work on their reaction time. They learn to hold a state of intense, hair-trigger alertness, waiting for the signal - but no one, coaches have learned, can hold that state for long, so they hate it when too much time passes after the set. </p> <p>\"We're talking about thousandths of a second!\" says George Dale, president of the International Track And Field Coaches Association. \"Flash bulbs, noise from the crowd, a pin drop can make a person move. They concentrate on the sound - that's all they're keyed into.\" </p> <p>Can it be that we are finally reaching a point of diminishing returns in racing, a point of virtual perfection? Statistical trends over time suggest that we are, as a species, approaching asymptotically a true maximum speed. Especially in the basic, ancient races between runner and runner, swimmer and swimmer, we may simply be closing in on an absolute limit to the speed that can be drawn in a big and well-trained world from the combination of muscle strength, preparation and technique. If nothing else, we can no longer tell winners from losers without the aid of a very good clock.</p> <p>Between thoughts, there are gaps - very, very short gaps. Can this time be used? Measurable breaks separate the songs on record albums. Some are longer than others. That is usually deliberate. A sensitive record producer will run songs almost together or leave a perceptible pause, depending on the desired effect.</p> <p>Someone, though, must have realised that these gaps are a waste of time, in the same peculiar sense as the momentary fadeouts between segments of television programming. It had to be someone who realised just how long a second can be - not a mere instant anymore, but a space stretching before us as a hectic container, with events and voids, to be filled with milli-, nano-, or picothings. Certainly a second is long enough for impatience to begin welling up. So the Sony Discman, circa 1996, offers a function that lets the user close the gaps on CDs. The instructions suggest, \"You can enjoy playing with less blank space between the tracks.\"</p> <p>The evolution of technology has long been about saving time, but on grosser scales than now. Certainly the cotton gin, the automobile, and the vacuum cleaner let people work, move, and clean faster - savings to be measured in hours and minutes. Now we're saving fractional seconds: a millisecond here, a millisecond there - does it really add up? The consumer-product laboratories think so. They are slicing time ever more finely for us.</p> <p>Other kinds of inventors may be making more profound use of their windows on to the millisecond world. Air bags, as a life-saving feature of automobiles, were conceived and designed only when it became possible to visualise complex mechanical sagas happening - beginning, middle and end - in one-tenth of a second. The creators of air bags were carrying on in the trail blazed by Englishman Eadweard Muybridge, who in 1873 took on the task of finding out whether, when trotting, horses lifted all four hooves from the ground. Could, they asked, the knowledge of time's microcosm help out in daily life?</p> <p>Toasters are toasting faster - pushing the limits set by the thermal conductivity of bread, if you want the centre warm before the surface blackens. It could take two or three minutes for an under-the-tongue thermometer to rise to your temperature; new thermometers are electronic and, naturally, faster. By comparison, the time-saving promised by J F Lazartigue's s\u00e9chage rapide shampoo seems gross and vague: its polymers with perfluorides purport to hasten drying by 30%.</p> <p>The household-products designers at companies such as Black &amp; Decker, developers of the Dustbuster miniature vacuum cleaner, find time-saving opportunities all through the household day.

      "bodyText": "We are in a rush. We are making haste. A compression of time characterises life today. Airport gates are minor intensifiers of the lose-not-a-minute anguish of our age. There are other intensifiers - places and objects that signify impatience. Certain notorious intersections and tollbooths. Doctors' anterooms (\"waiting\" rooms). The \"door close\" button in elevators, so often a placebo, with no function but to distract for a moment those riders to whom 10 seconds seems an eternity. Speed-dial buttons on telephones: do you invest minutes in programming them and reap your reward in tenths of a second? Remote controls: their very existence, in the hands of a quick-reflexed, multi-tasking, channel-flipping, fast-forwarding citizenry, has caused an acceleration in the pace of films and television commercials. We have a word for free time: leisure. Leisure is time off the books, off the job, off the clock. If we save time, we commonly believe we are saving it for our leisure. We know that leisure is really a state of mind, but no dictionary can define it without reference to passing time. It is unrestricted time, unemployed time, unoccupied time. Or is it? Unoccupied time is vanishing. The leisure industries (an oxymoron maybe, but no contradiction) fill time, as groundwater fills a sinkhole. The very variety of experience attacks our leisure as it attempts to satiate us. We work for our amusement. Five hundred channels became a watchword of the 90s even before, strictly speaking, it became a reality. It denotes too much to choose from. And not just channels: coffees, magazines and on-line 'zines, mustards and olive oils, celebrity perfumes and celebrity rumours, fissioning musical styles and digitised recordings of more different performances of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony than Beethoven could have heard in his lifetime. All humanity has not succumbed equally, of course. If you make haste, you probably make it in the technology-driven western world, possibly in a large city - including, certainly, the most prosperous cities of the United States, Europe and Asia. Sociologists in several countries have found that increasing wealth and increasing education bring a sense of tension about time. We believe that we possess too little of it: that is a myth we now live by. What is true is that we are awash in things, in information, in news, in the old rubble and shiny new toys of our complex civilisation, and - strange, perhaps - stuff means speed. The wave patterns of all these facts and choices flow and crash about us at a heightened frequency. We live in the buzz. We wish to live intensely, and we wonder about the consequences - whether, perhaps, we face the biological dilemma of the waterflea, whose heart beats faster as the temperature rises. This creature lives almost four months at 46 degrees Fahrenheit but less than one month at 82 degrees. \"Technology has been a rapid heartbeat, compressing housework, travel, entertainment, squeezing more and more into the allotted span,\" notes the social historian Theodore Zeldin. \"Nobody expected that it would create the feeling that life moves too fast.\" It has created exactly this feeling. The laziest among us have acquired a heightened awareness of time - by necessity. The modern economy lives and dies by precision in time's measurement and efficiency in its employment. If money is the visible currency of trade, time is its doppelg\u00e4nger, a coin over which companies and consumers battle, consciously or unconsciously, with ever-greater urgency. You probably notice most assaults on your wallet, but do you notice when a business makes a grab for a few extra seconds of your time? You may contemplate your losses while you wait in the serpentine line at the airport ticket counter or navigate a six-minute telephone queue that has replaced a human who might once have answered your question in a few seconds. In return, marketers and technologists anticipate your desires with fast ovens, quick playback, quick freezing, and fast credit. We bank the extra minutes that flow from these innovations, yet we feel impoverished and we cut back - on breakfast, on lunch, on sleep, on daydreams. Federal Express and McDonald's have created whole new segments of the economy by understanding, capitalising on - and then in their own ways fostering - our haste. \"Tired of working overtime?\" ask scores of advertisements. A medication is marketed \"for women who don't have time for a yeast infection\" - as though slackers might have time for that. The defining quality of haste is only now coming into focus in our cultural mirrors, as in the New Yorker cartoons: (1996) man getting into cab - \"And step on it. This restaurant may be over any minute\"; (1997) man speaking into telephone - \"No, I don't have four seconds to talk.\" Even Bill Gates, with his abundance of money, his private jet, and his fast cars, complains, \"It seems like the whole world operates in five-minute intervals.\" So who can escape their awareness of the pressure? Not the US chat-show host David Letterman. \"I'll try to be brief - we've done a lot of focus groups and people complain that I'm talking too much,\" he tells his Late Show audience. \"They say it delays the show.\" Pruning minutes and seconds and hundredths of seconds has become an obsession in all but a few segments of our society. In the spirit of Olympic swimmers shaving their chest hair, television networks are ever so delicately shaving the \"blacks\"-the punctuation marks between shows, when the screen fades momentarily to darkness. Yet we have made our choices and are still making them. We humans have chosen speed, and we thrive on it - more than we generally admit. Our ability to work fast and play fast gives us power. It thrills us. If we have learned the name of just one hormone, it is adrenaline. No wonder we call sudden exhilaration a rush. \"Your life is lived with the kind of excitement that your forebears knew only in battle,\" observes the writer Mark Helprin. And: \"They, unlike you, were the prisoner of mundane tasks. They wrote with pens, they did addition, they waited endlessly for things that come to you instantaneously, they had far less than you do, and they bowed to necessity, as you do not. You love the pace, the giddy, continual acceleration.\" Admit it - you do! Still, you have not truly explored the consequences of haste in our culture and in our daily lives. You hardly perceive the acceleration of art and entertainment: the changing pace of media from cinema to television commercials that reflect and condition a changing pace in our psyches. Instantaneity rules in the network and in our emotional lives: instant coffee, instant intimacy, instant replay, and instant gratification. Pollsters use electronic devices during political speeches to measure opinions on the wing, before they have been fully formed. Like missiles spawning mirvs, fast-food restaurants add express lanes. If we do not understand time, we become its victims. \"Time is a gentle deity,\" said Sophocles. Perhaps it was, for him. These days it cracks the whip. From an article titled Ten Tall Tales About Composting: \"A number of magazine ads have hoodwinked well-intentioned gardeners into thinking that they must produce compost in 14 days. Such expectations are unrealistic and unworthy. Decomposition takes time. While producing compost quickly has some merit, no one should feel compelled to purchase chipper-shredders or other elaborate equipment. In fact, even if material looks like compost after several weeks, it still requires an additional one-month maturation period before it should be used...\" You can't hurry compost for the same reason you can't hurry love and you can't hurry a souffl\u00e9. The biochemistry has its own inherent pace. That doesn't mean you won't try. You suspect, without even thinking about it, that any business called Dombey &amp; Sons, Trujillo &amp; Sons, Eubelhor &amp; Sons, or even Harvey &amp; Daughters must be a venerable business indeed. People are not founding companies today, as they once did, in hopes that their grandchildren will some day carry on the family tradition. No. Grandchildren take time. Nor does one buy deep-blue denim jeans with their dye stiff as tin, resigned to wearing them for a year before achieving a faded \"look\". One buys them prewashed, pre-faded, and maybe pre-patched at the knees or seat. Who can wait for nature to take its course? The traditional leather jacket, like a second skin after 10 years of wearing, was not actually comfortable in its first year. You had to make an investment. The attachment to old clothes is in the teddy-bear category, growing more from an emotional web of associations than from anything in the cloth. As our reflexes have certain speeds, so does our formation of memories, our accretion of nostalgia. So can the years of breaking-in be effectively bypassed? Apparently so, because a typical catalogue advertises the \"Been There Leather Jacket\": \"A jacket that (in former lives) has seen it all... There are legends and sagas in each ruck and crease of the distressed, heavy, full-grain cowhide.\" Naturally, it sports \"antiqued hardware\". In 1997, Disney advertised the film The Little Mermaid as \"the timeless classic\". Just eight years earlier it was a new movie. Is this, too, a way of straining against the limits of biology - this rapid would-be insertion of a new cultural icon into our store of classic memories? We humans used to feel like the laggards, with nature marching briskly onward. Time and tide wait for no man. \"In our day of electric wires,\" Mark Twain said, prematurely, \"... we turn it around. Man waits not for time nor tide.\" Some of biology is essentially a pause: sleep, for example. Pauses serve a purpose, breaking the flow. Like rests in music or caesuras in verse. Like the old nightly break in the news cycle and the financial markets, gone in our 24:7 era. Even a confirmed atheist and Sunday driver must believe that the Sabbath served a therapeutic purpose, too, in the epoch when people observed it. Now, of course, Puritanical \"blue\" laws (\"No woman shall kiss her child on Sabbath or fasting day\"!) are mostly long gone, and Federal Express boasts of delivering on Sunday \"because the world works seven days a week\". Haydn may have been the first great master of the rest in musical composition; he used rests for surprise, rests for tension, and even rests with fermatas. Silence indefinitely prolonged. Rest and pause. A rest with a fermata is the moral opposite of the fast-food restaurant with express lane. Modern conservatories find these strangely troubling for some students, who can play the most intricate polyrhythms find it difficult to give the rest its full value, let alone the vague extra time called for by the fermata. They just can't wait long enough. There are enforced pauses in the eating of pistachio nuts; pre-shelled pistachios are an expensive luxury - another fast food - and strangely disappointing. It is relevant that researchers in time-compressed speech, discovering hidden punctuation in the pauses that dot our conversation, found that intelligibility declines as the pauses are removed. For most of us, coffee breaks have gone the way of enforced Sabbaths, and neither transcendental meditation nor the sensory-deprivation tank seems likely to replace them. From a cosmic point of view, the velocity of human thought is more or less fixed - attuned in sometimes useful ways to the velocity of an apple falling from a tree, to the rate of the Earth's spin, to the leaping speed of a predatory coyote, to the gentle passing of the seasons, to the wavelengths of visible light and audible sound. We are defined by these velocities, among others. You could imagine species living on quite different timetables. In fact, you can see them: bumblebees or bristlecone pines, inhabiting temporal planes that barely intersect our own. Careful, though. Speed is not who you are. From a parochial point of view, we could concern ourselves with small variations in human speeds. We do make a sport out of comparative running speeds. If we were the sort of psychologists who like to be termed \"psychometricians\", we could pretend to make a science out of comparative thinking speeds. In athletic competition, technology has turned the briefest intervals into arenas for competition. The margins have become so fine that chance easily overcomes the talent that racers strive so hard to perfect. Gusts of wind, uneven turf, random differences in the lengths of swimming-pool lanes can all come into play. The millisecond has come into its own. Baseball, commonly said to be a game of inches, is revealed by the fastest modern cameras to be a game of milliseconds. The pivotal events occur in these tiny windows, testing umpires' reflexes. No ordinary hand-held stopwatch can resolve a millisecond; thus, until recently, a millisecond could not be the margin of victory in sports. Now it can. Luge is one of the events for which Olympic rules now allow a victory by mere milliseconds. Canoeing and bicycling are others. Millisecond-sensitivity breeds further dependence on technology. Swimmers clothe themselves in Teflon-coated microfibre suits. Bicyclists ride machines whose aerodynamic properties were honed in wind tunnels. For the sake of fairness, when the world's fastest sprinters line up for the 100-metre dash, the sound of the gun comes to them electronically, to protect against millisecond differences in the time of its arrival through the open breeze. Lasers shine on their backs to provide a continuous Doppler measurement of speed, acceleration, deceleration. And the finish line is monitored by filmless, computer-enhanced, digital cameras, splitting time with a precision beyond the reach of human senses. Carl Lewis, at his peak, occasionally lost 100-metre races that he had run faster than his competitors. His reaction time - the time it takes for the starting signal to translate through eardrum, brain, nerves and muscles - was generally mediocre, on the order of 140 milliseconds, compared with 115 to 120 milliseconds for the fastest starters. That one-fiftieth of a second difference now matters. It matters so much that reaction times are now regularly monitored. Officials declare a false start not only if a runner moves before the gun but also if a runner moves within a tenth of a second after the gun - because reaction times that fast are believed to be humanly impossible. So runners these days do not just practise running. They practise throwing precisely the optimal piece of torso across the invisible finish line demarcated by the hairline within the electronic camera. They work on their reaction time. They learn to hold a state of intense, hair-trigger alertness, waiting for the signal - but no one, coaches have learned, can hold that state for long, so they hate it when too much time passes after the set. \"We're talking about thousandths of a second!\" says George Dale, president of the International Track And Field Coaches Association. \"Flash bulbs, noise from the crowd, a pin drop can make a person move. They concentrate on the sound - that's all they're keyed into.\" Can it be that we are finally reaching a point of diminishing returns in racing, a point of virtual perfection? Statistical trends over time suggest that we are, as a species, approaching asymptotically a true maximum speed. Especially in the basic, ancient races between runner and runner, swimmer and swimmer, we may simply be closing in on an absolute limit to the speed that can be drawn in a big and well-trained world from the combination of muscle strength, preparation and technique. If nothing else, we can no longer tell winners from losers without the aid of a very good clock. Between thoughts, there are gaps - very, very short gaps. Can this time be used? Measurable breaks separate the songs on record albums. Some are longer than others. That is usually deliberate. A sensitive record producer will run songs almost together or leave a perceptible pause, depending on the desired effect. Someone, though, must have realised that these gaps are a waste of time, in the same peculiar sense as the momentary fadeouts between segments of television programming. It had to be someone who realised just how long a second can be - not a mere instant anymore, but a space stretching before us as a hectic container, with events and voids, to be filled with milli-, nano-, or picothings. Certainly a second is long enough for impatience to begin welling up. So the Sony Discman, circa 1996, offers a function that lets the user close the gaps on CDs. The instructions suggest, \"You can enjoy playing with less blank space between the tracks.\" The evolution of technology has long been about saving time, but on grosser scales than now. Certainly the cotton gin, the automobile, and the vacuum cleaner let people work, move, and clean faster - savings to be measured in hours and minutes. Now we're saving fractional seconds: a millisecond here, a millisecond there - does it really add up? The consumer-product laboratories think so. They are slicing time ever more finely for us. Other kinds of inventors may be making more profound use of their windows on to the millisecond world. Air bags, as a life-saving feature of automobiles, were conceived and designed only when it became possible to visualise complex mechanical sagas happening - beginning, middle and end - in one-tenth of a second.

      "body": "<p><strong> Life in the Jungle: My Autobiography</strong><br> Michael Heseltine<br> 304pp, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320 <br> </p> <p> Writing memoirs is one activity in which the Labour record has been consistently better than that of the Tories. The Benn, Crossman and Castle diaries, like the Jenkins and Healey autobiographies, testify to a category difference. Those on the British left have had more interest in observing themselves in action, and then setting down the record with revelatory candour, than any post-war Conservative has shown. Nigel Lawson is their closest rival, and parts of Thatcher, Howe and Prior edge towards recklessness. But the average Conservative mind doesn't like such work. Long-discarded volumes labelled Tebbit and Fowler, Whitelaw and Carrington are as useless to historians as they proved indigestible to the modest handful of readers who opened them. </p> <p>Michael Heseltine's autobiography has been awaited with more optimism. Here is a very big politician, never far from controversy. No shrinking violet Hezza. He was at the front line for a long time, often courting risk, famously independent, the witness to many dramas, a man who every year at the party conference grandly shook his hair at far horizons. Now an elder statesman, ambition frustrated but perforce sated, he is positioned to tell a riveting story of his life and times. </p> <p>The early days set the scene for a recognisable figure. Born in Swansea of modest entrepreneurial stock, he had a happy childhood, and he recreates its pleasures well. Even at Shrewsbury, which he didn't enjoy, he was into business, buying fizzy drinks cheap and selling them expensive. Rejected by Reading and Bristol Universities for academic inadequacy, he got into Oxford on the strength of an interview with the college Master. There, he revived the finances of the Union by starting a nightclub in the basement, and then got the Dockers, louche fast-money socialites of their day, to pay for it. </p> <p>The lineaments of the buccaneering shaker thus begin to emerge. He was always concerned about his hair, getting his personal barber to shave it off before National Service rather than risk an army scalping. He bought a Jag before he was 25, and dined for years before that at the Connaught. This was on the strength of early successes in the property business, which had its downs as well as ups, and which Heseltine describes with some thoroughness. He has been at least as successful at business as politics, which is very rare. Though he reports that he still, as a semi-dyslexic, doesn't like reading, he writes a serviceable prose - sometimes, especially when he gets to Westland, with considerable narrative power. </p> <p>Yet when we reach his central, public life, the book begins to depart from the character we might have thought we understood. Although it is a long book, it's a disappointingly small one. The horizons remain unaddressed: many large events he saw and took part in do not feature here. A man who seemed to be a quintessential exponent of high politics has written a memoir that, to a large extent, eschews them. </p> <p>The great figures who surrounded him escape, for the most part, considered evaluation. The Mail serialisation made out that this was a violent attack on Margaret Thatcher, but the slivers it put together to satisfy its appetite must have come from widely scattered paragraphs. Though Heseltine makes plain his disagreements, there's no set-piece attack, just as there are few piercing judgments on other colleagues. Only Norman Lamont comes in for a truly cutting verdict on his various duplicities. John Major, Kenneth Clarke, Douglas Hurd are treated amicably, and not untruthfully, but without the judgmental distance one might have looked for. </p> <p>This accords with Heseltine's habit as a politician. Like Tony Benn, he seldom talked personalities. But now he is an author, recording his days for the instruction of an audience, and his self-denial reaches into the more serious field of major policy. What Hezza did not do himself, it seems, he decided not to write about at all. Perhaps such punctilio should be admirable: only record what you know at first hand. Actually, it leaves gaping holes that he could very well have filled, had he possessed the chronicler's fascination of a Denis Healey. </p> <p>The story he does tell often falls into the worthy but mundane: valuable to later historians but less gripping to contemporary readers aware of what they're missing. Heseltine was a very serious minister, who spent long years in two bursts getting to close grips with urban renewal and the built environment. He writes with convincing passion, in great detail, about what he did in Liverpool. We watch his theories and policies about the infrastructure of Britain, dating from his first jobs in the Heath government, coming to fruition with remarkable frequency over 30 years. </p> <p>He was also a resolute Whitehall manager, who retained an enthusiasm for the minutiae of such work wherever we went, and not least in the Ministry of Defence. Spicing the story, we get a fuller picture, also, of how flak-jacketed Tarzan triumphed over CND. But the saga ends with our man back in Whitehall, Major's deputy prime minister in charge of management-chasing, still undiminished in his fascination with administrative machinery, and reversing an earlier conviction that departmental ministers should be left alone by the centre. </p> <p>But in all these years the cabinet goes virtually unreported. Not a single cabinet meeting is described, and no kind of justice is done to the colossal rows, which Heseltine intimately witnessed, about monetarism and its consequences in the early Thatcher years. The defining argument between Lawson and Thatcher about economic management in the mid-1980s might as well not have happened, for all the attention it gets here. The European battles that ripped the Tories apart echo but dimly in the distance. Even the departure from the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, when he was back in the thick of things, is most cursorily treated. He was not, you see, in charge. And as a memoirist - the difference between Tory and Labour - he suffers fatally for sticking to rules of secrecy that are long outdated. </p> <p>The prize of the piece, however, is a good one. The story of the Westland scandal, which precipitated Heseltine's departure from the cabinet in 1986, has not been more authoritatively told.

      "bodyText": "Life in the Jungle: My Autobiography Michael Heseltine 304pp, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320 Writing memoirs is one activity in which the Labour record has been consistently better than that of the Tories. The Benn, Crossman and Castle diaries, like the Jenkins and Healey autobiographies, testify to a category difference. Those on the British left have had more interest in observing themselves in action, and then setting down the record with revelatory candour, than any post-war Conservative has shown. Nigel Lawson is their closest rival, and parts of Thatcher, Howe and Prior edge towards recklessness. But the average Conservative mind doesn't like such work. Long-discarded volumes labelled Tebbit and Fowler, Whitelaw and Carrington are as useless to historians as they proved indigestible to the modest handful of readers who opened them. Michael Heseltine's autobiography has been awaited with more optimism. Here is a very big politician, never far from controversy. No shrinking violet Hezza. He was at the front line for a long time, often courting risk, famously independent, the witness to many dramas, a man who every year at the party conference grandly shook his hair at far horizons. Now an elder statesman, ambition frustrated but perforce sated, he is positioned to tell a riveting story of his life and times. The early days set the scene for a recognisable figure. Born in Swansea of modest entrepreneurial stock, he had a happy childhood, and he recreates its pleasures well. Even at Shrewsbury, which he didn't enjoy, he was into business, buying fizzy drinks cheap and selling them expensive. Rejected by Reading and Bristol Universities for academic inadequacy, he got into Oxford on the strength of an interview with the college Master. There, he revived the finances of the Union by starting a nightclub in the basement, and then got the Dockers, louche fast-money socialites of their day, to pay for it. The lineaments of the buccaneering shaker thus begin to emerge. He was always concerned about his hair, getting his personal barber to shave it off before National Service rather than risk an army scalping. He bought a Jag before he was 25, and dined for years before that at the Connaught. This was on the strength of early successes in the property business, which had its downs as well as ups, and which Heseltine describes with some thoroughness. He has been at least as successful at business as politics, which is very rare. Though he reports that he still, as a semi-dyslexic, doesn't like reading, he writes a serviceable prose - sometimes, especially when he gets to Westland, with considerable narrative power. Yet when we reach his central, public life, the book begins to depart from the character we might have thought we understood. Although it is a long book, it's a disappointingly small one. The horizons remain unaddressed: many large events he saw and took part in do not feature here. A man who seemed to be a quintessential exponent of high politics has written a memoir that, to a large extent, eschews them. The great figures who surrounded him escape, for the most part, considered evaluation. The Mail serialisation made out that this was a violent attack on Margaret Thatcher, but the slivers it put together to satisfy its appetite must have come from widely scattered paragraphs. Though Heseltine makes plain his disagreements, there's no set-piece attack, just as there are few piercing judgments on other colleagues. Only Norman Lamont comes in for a truly cutting verdict on his various duplicities. John Major, Kenneth Clarke, Douglas Hurd are treated amicably, and not untruthfully, but without the judgmental distance one might have looked for. This accords with Heseltine's habit as a politician. Like Tony Benn, he seldom talked personalities. But now he is an author, recording his days for the instruction of an audience, and his self-denial reaches into the more serious field of major policy. What Hezza did not do himself, it seems, he decided not to write about at all. Perhaps such punctilio should be admirable: only record what you know at first hand. Actually, it leaves gaping holes that he could very well have filled, had he possessed the chronicler's fascination of a Denis Healey. The story he does tell often falls into the worthy but mundane: valuable to later historians but less gripping to contemporary readers aware of what they're missing. Heseltine was a very serious minister, who spent long years in two bursts getting to close grips with urban renewal and the built environment. He writes with convincing passion, in great detail, about what he did in Liverpool. We watch his theories and policies about the infrastructure of Britain, dating from his first jobs in the Heath government, coming to fruition with remarkable frequency over 30 years. He was also a resolute Whitehall manager, who retained an enthusiasm for the minutiae of such work wherever we went, and not least in the Ministry of Defence. Spicing the story, we get a fuller picture, also, of how flak-jacketed Tarzan triumphed over CND. But the saga ends with our man back in Whitehall, Major's deputy prime minister in charge of management-chasing, still undiminished in his fascination with administrative machinery, and reversing an earlier conviction that departmental ministers should be left alone by the centre. But in all these years the cabinet goes virtually unreported. Not a single cabinet meeting is described, and no kind of justice is done to the colossal rows, which Heseltine intimately witnessed, about monetarism and its consequences in the early Thatcher years. The defining argument between Lawson and Thatcher about economic management in the mid-1980s might as well not have happened, for all the attention it gets here. The European battles that ripped the Tories apart echo but dimly in the distance. Even the departure from the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, when he was back in the thick of things, is most cursorily treated. He was not, you see, in charge. And as a memoirist - the difference between Tory and Labour - he suffers fatally for sticking to rules of secrecy that are long outdated. The prize of the piece, however, is a good one. The story of the Westland scandal, which precipitated Heseltine's departure from the cabinet in 1986, has not been more authoritatively told. One is reminded, with some extra juicy bits, of the unconscionable behaviour of Mrs Thatcher and her entourage, which none of their memoirs has satisfactorily explained. Nor has the old man lost his venom here. He includes an email address where he can be contacted, by anyone with light to throw on the post-Westland share-rigging concert-party which, he still seems to be convinced, involved shadowy Thatcherites and others. His book, earnestly done and thorough as far as it goes, recounts the life of a man with important convictions, and a commitment to public life that folded ambition into service in admirable proportions. It offers mini-glimpses that startle and reveal. Heseltine wanted Chris Patten, instead of going to Hong Kong, to be the first recipient of a constitutional innovation, and take a one-term life peerage prior to fighting the next election. He says that when he failed to beat Major for the leadership, he was \"in tears\". He reveals that the Dome could have been an even worse catastrophe: there was a time when Hyde Park was thought to be the place for it. But ultimately the book exposes a narrower man than the big politician who wrote it. Or perhaps not. Maybe, in the end, the minister as manager, as armchair quarter-master, as urban renewer, as competitiveness addict at the DTI, as tunnel-vision European, is what Michael Heseltine was.

Taylor, who prided himself on his intellectual independence, should have realised that a gathering with such a title was likely to be concerned more with propaganda than with the pursuit of knowledge. But he was not a man to be intimidated by his surroundings, and his spontaneous speech reminded delegates: \"We and the French were the only people who went to war with Nazi Germany without being attacked.\" He went on to denounce \"Yugoslavia's resistance being blotted out in order to suit the convenience of a political party\".

He clearly saw himself as immensely worldly, and had three wives and many rich and powerful friends to confirm his social sophistication. But he was blessed with a simplicity - at least about his effect on other people - that goes close to making his intellectual arrogance endearing. He could never understand why, being both a great scholar and a brilliant teacher, he was denied so many professorships. And he remained sensitive right to the end.

He offers in Martha Peake an accomplished masterclass, with every Gothic standby in place: the dark tale in a crumbling stately pile, winds howling outside; the antihero, heroic in his flaws; the coldly dangerous nobleman and his hunched, leering servant; the hand falling on the shoulder as the candle winks out and the swoon signalling horrors beyond words. </p> <p>McGrath has admitted that \"I deliberately feed the imagination by reading\", and historical pastiche is a readerly endeavour, uniting writer and audience through shared bookshelves and chummy nods at the correct conventions.

      "bodyText": "Martha Peake Patrick McGrath 340pp, Viking, \u00a312.99 After the modern Gothic of Asylum, with its sexual obsession and psychiatric disorders, Patrick McGrath has plunged wholeheartedly into the 18th-century heyday of the genre. He offers in Martha Peake an accomplished masterclass, with every Gothic standby in place: the dark tale in a crumbling stately pile, winds howling outside; the antihero, heroic in his flaws; the coldly dangerous nobleman and his hunched, leering servant; the hand falling on the shoulder as the candle winks out and the swoon signalling horrors beyond words. McGrath has admitted that \"I deliberately feed the imagination by reading\", and historical pastiche is a readerly endeavour, uniting writer and audience through shared bookshelves and chummy nods at the correct conventions. The author is applauded for the linguistic equivalent of keeping digital watches out of shot, and purple passages read as literary authenticity. There is an especial danger of merely stylish exercise when reanimating a beast as easily identikit as the Gothic novel.

He is a former Tory minister who now approvingly cites Marxist theorists. He does not appear to approve of much else. In this book, among many other dislikes, he specifies royal watchers and Estuary English, the current school system, politicians who smile, contemporary British television, the NHS (\"unworkable\"), both Chris Evans (\"mesmerically talent-free\") and Dennis Potter (\"overrated and voyeuristic\") and \"anyone who dresses down for social reasons\". </p> <p>Walden went to Cambridge. He also attended universities in Paris, Moscow, Hong Kong and Harvard. For more than 20 years, he worked for the Foreign Office. It is easy to imagine this book, as its brisk and barbed opening pages unfurl, as the transcript of a wittily world-weary monologue at a diplomatic party. </p> <p>At first, Walden murmurs his views in quick little sentences. Modern Britain is dominated by elites. The old ones - aristocrats, politicians - are declining. New ones - media executives, educationalists - are taking their place. But the latter pretend they are not elites at all. They dress down. They roughen their accents. They pretend they are democratically \"giving the people what they want\", when this process, as Walden neatly points out, actually \"implies a top-down motion\". </p> <p>The society that has resulted, he says, is no more equal than the Britain of old. A small number of the smartly educated and well-connected rule as usual, but with the added advantages of disguise and much better salaries. The rest of the population - referred to by the new elites as \"Middle England\", \"the people\", or whatever term is most politically convenient - are called on only to give a vague, and not necessarily genuine, popular weight to plans already made. </p> <p>This doomy world-view is grandly stated at times; Walden uses the word \"postulates\" in his second sentence. He insists he is a democrat and a meritocrat, but then extensively quotes long-forgotten critics of equality and \"the masses\" such as Robert Michels and Vilfredo Pareto, lauded on his death (as Walden admits) by Mussolini's press as a prototype fascist. And beneath the connoisseur's references and crisp words, there is a confidence that arguments need not always be completed. Walden languidly dismisses the many other British \"cultural lamentations\" currently on sale in bookshops as \"somehow dispiriting\", while exempting his own without explaining the difference. Similarly, the standard left-wing argument that society's elite remains the rich is waved aside as \"dated\". </p> <p>This latter oversight increasingly colours and limits the book. \"It beggars credulity,\" he writes of the belief that \"old Etonians . . . the Oxbridge set . . . the silly hats over sillier faces at Ascot . . . currently order society or impose its values.\" You wonder if he has ever visited a firm of management consultants. Likewise Rupert Murdoch, who went to Oxford and inherited a fortune, and the ever-expanding sharkpool of British business magnates, so many of whom relied on family for their first million, are weakly exempted from the charge of bullying the country. </p> <p>Instead, Walden gleefully assaults the ex-grammar school barristers, pop stars and architects who make up New Labour's favoured circle; as he does so he seems, for all his claims to political neutrality and references to Gramsci, more and more of a Tory at heart. The old order of things was preferable, he frequently implies; the new is to be mercilessly rather than judiciously criticised. </p> <p>He makes some welcome points about the new elites' excesses and hypocrisies: their fondness for selective or private schools while recommending comprehensives for others; their enthusiasm for employing their offspring while condemning the hereditary principle. The overimportance of the press is perceptively challenged, especially its tendency to moralise while growing ever more profligate and pragmatic in its own affairs. </p> <p>But there is a sour impatience here with even the tiniest flaws in the Britain that Blair's government is trying to shape. That the country and its elites may be in a difficult transition to something slightly fairer and more open - with all the ugly compromises, such as \"socialist\" film producers sitting in the Lords, which this implies - is not a possibility Walden seems prepared to entertain. A long chapter attacks the current vogue for idealising the ambitious working woman. Walden is so busy drawing slightly offensive parallels with the old Soviet use of role models and letting his usually lithe sentences tangle with indignation that he sounds like he doesn't favour successful women at all. </p> <p>Perhaps that's the trouble with the elegantly world-weary. What starts as refreshing truth-telling can, once the intoxication of putting the world to rights sets in, become a rant against all comers. By the end, Walden is still in his corner, cutting the other guests at Blair's big party down to size, but the fizz has gone from his talk.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair yesterday showed his determination to break up the failing model of comprehensive schools in England and Wales, demanding greater help for the most gifted pupils in the state sector.</p> <p>In remarks that will cause unease among the party grassroots, he claimed the modern secondary state school must be as dedicated to the needs of the most gifted child as any private or grammar school.</p> <p>\"Too often comprehensives adopted a one-size-fits-all mentality - no setting, uniform provision for all, hostile to the notion of specialisation and centres of excellence within areas of the curriculum,\" he told a meeting of Progress, a group of modernising Labour activists, in Bedfordshire.</p> <p>Mr Blair once again rejected demands for an extension of selection for secondary schools, but said instead there had to be a further expansion of \"rigorous setting\" whereby the most talented pupils are grouped in a separate class.</p> <p>Mounting his clearest indictment yet of the comprehensive principles of the 60s and 70s, he said: \"We expect every secondary school to do as well for high-ability pupils, through first-rate teaching and facilities, rigorous setting and personalised provision. Comprehensives should be as dedicated as any private school or old grammar school to high achievement for the most able.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair defended his vision, saying \"comprehensive should cease meaning the same for all and instead mean equal opportunity for all to develop their intelligence to the full\".</p> <p>He said the old left had played into the hands of the right by failing to recognise that \"children do have different abilities and aptitudes and schools need to provide for these in their setting, teaching and curriculum\".</p> <p>The government's Excellence in Cities initiative, designed to help gifted pupils in urban schools in England and Wales, is due to expand to more than 800 secondary schools by the start of this term. Under the programme, talented children are placed in special classes, given access to top-up lessons and to local specialist schools if the relevant tuition is not otherwise available.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday showed his determination to break up the failing model of comprehensive schools in England and Wales, demanding greater help for the most gifted pupils in the state sector. In remarks that will cause unease among the party grassroots, he claimed the modern secondary state school must be as dedicated to the needs of the most gifted child as any private or grammar school. \"Too often comprehensives adopted a one-size-fits-all mentality - no setting, uniform provision for all, hostile to the notion of specialisation and centres of excellence within areas of the curriculum,\" he told a meeting of Progress, a group of modernising Labour activists, in Bedfordshire. Mr Blair once again rejected demands for an extension of selection for secondary schools, but said instead there had to be a further expansion of \"rigorous setting\" whereby the most talented pupils are grouped in a separate class. Mounting his clearest indictment yet of the comprehensive principles of the 60s and 70s, he said: \"We expect every secondary school to do as well for high-ability pupils, through first-rate teaching and facilities, rigorous setting and personalised provision. Comprehensives should be as dedicated as any private school or old grammar school to high achievement for the most able.\" Mr Blair defended his vision, saying \"comprehensive should cease meaning the same for all and instead mean equal opportunity for all to develop their intelligence to the full\". He said the old left had played into the hands of the right by failing to recognise that \"children do have different abilities and aptitudes and schools need to provide for these in their setting, teaching and curriculum\". The government's Excellence in Cities initiative, designed to help gifted pupils in urban schools in England and Wales, is due to expand to more than 800 secondary schools by the start of this term. Under the programme, talented children are placed in special classes, given access to top-up lessons and to local specialist schools if the relevant tuition is not otherwise available. Ministers hope that by 2003 one in four secondary schools - 800 in total - will be specialist ones. The education secretary, David Blunkett, is due to announce shortly the introduction of six city academies, a cross between US charter schools and the Conservatives' city technology colleges. They will be largely free of local education authority control and free to roam outside normal salary structures. More measures to involve parents in their children's education are to be announced next week. They may involve pressing poorly educated parents to take part in so-called family literacy projects. Mr Blair rejected an expansion of grammar schools on the grounds that it would require \"writing off the majority [of pupils] after only six years of schooling when their abilities and aptitudes are not fully apparent or even formed\". He also insisted his praise for private schools did not imply endorsement of the right's belief that \"only a minority are capable of success at school\". He said: \"We believe that all are capable of reaching high minimum standards, and that the great majority are capable of going on to higher education or gaining good vocational qualifications\". Mr Blair's remarks were designed to reveal a new confidence in the Labour high command after a rocky last few months. They were also intended to show that Mr Blair plans to go into the next election with a radical rather than safety-first manifesto. Since the parliamentary recess William Hague and Charles Kennedy have both set out their alternative visions. But with Labour once again drawing clear in the polls, Mr Blair said the party had never had more confidence in its values and ideas. He claimed Mr Hague's policy package \"was quite the wackiest collection of half-baked quarter-thought-out policy any political party has produced for a long time\". \"Had Labour produced such a document in opposition, we would have been eviscerated the next day,\" he said. In a question and answer session, he also signalled a shift from the control freak era by saying the party needed to rebuild its organisation.
