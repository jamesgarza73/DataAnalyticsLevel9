      "byline": "Tim Adams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In a rehearsal studio up a side alley, not far from the Liffey, Conor McPherson is in his element. He's listening to three generations of Irish actors talk about love, in words that are unmistakably his own: direct and exact and layered with deadpan lyricism. Even in a rough-edged read-through you feel shivers of recognition. Reticent and determined looking, McPherson describes what he wants to do as a playwright in very simple terms. He wants his sentences to 'paint clear pictures in people's heads'. His aim as a director is even more straightforward. 'I just want the actors to put their faith in the language,' he says, 'just let the words do the work.' </p> <p>McPherson has always made his craft look remarkably easy. His first notable play, This Lime Tree Bower, was rapturously received when he was only 23 and fresh out of University College, Dublin. It came complete with a mini-manifesto, a prefaced quote from Coleridge: 'No sound is dissonant which tells of life.' </p> <p>In the six years since he has kept rigorous faith in that idea, telling of life, with hardly a false note, in half a dozen plays and screenplays. With The Weir, a series of extraordinary haunted and haunting tales told in a remote bar in rural Ireland - a phenomenal success on Broadway and in the West End - he established himself as perhaps the pre-eminent narrative dramatist of his generation. And he shows no signs of letting up. He describes his new play, Port Authority, which we have been watching in rehearsal, as the most accomplished thing he has done. (He does this with a typical hesitant confidence - sure of his talent, unsure that he really wants to talk about it.) </p> <p>It is, in some ways, too, a distillation of what has gone before. 'The play is really three generations of Dublin men talking about how they face up to the responsibility of emotion,' he says. 'The three men could be related; they could be the same person. I don't know...' </p> <p>What he is sure about, characteristically, is the precise trajectory of the human feeling the men describe. The play suggests a progression of sorts, one that he sees as fundamental. 'The young person isn't certain that love can be real; the middle-aged man is only discovering that it is; and the older person seems so sure of it. I was interested in the way that many of us go through the whole of our lives staying with someone just out of complacency, because leaving isn't easy,' he says. 'It's about whether you are prepared to make yourself happy at the cost of someone else's happiness. And that's not just a personal or historical or psychological question. It's also a moral one.' </p> <p>It's tempting to suggest that Conor McPherson has had a formal training in this kind of dilemma. A postgraduate in ethics, he tutored students for a while in moral philosophy and planned to do a PhD (which, he says, slightly whimsically, is still a real possibility, 'a return to sanity'). His academic subject made him realise, 'above all, that I didn't know much about anything, and that none of us do'. But while this spirit may inform the comedy of his plays, their more poignant truths, he guesses, come from somewhere else. </p> <p>If McPherson's work has a recurrent theme, it is a fear of ending up on your own. 'I guess I'm attracted and repelled by isolation,' he says. 'It scares me. And it's why I tend to write about older characters, too, because for them the stakes are somewhat higher. You know, if you tell a person you're living with to go fuck themselves when you are 21, then you don't think too much of it; but if you say those same words near the end of your life, and then the person goes and walks out on you - where are you then?' </p> <p>Some of this sense of the fragility of communication which is at the heart of his best work, he learnt as a boy. McPherson grew up on a Dublin housing estate, his father taught accountancy, his mother worked in a shoe shop. In holidays and at weekends he would often go down on the train, alone, to visit his grandfather in Leitrim, the isolated setting for the barroom in The Weir. The remoteness of this other Ireland had a profound effect on him as a writer, he believes. 'My grandfather was there on his own,' McPherson recalls, nursing a post-rehearsal glass of Guinness. 'I was fairly quiet when I was a teenager, and I liked the way you could go down there and sit, you know, and not talk, really, and look at the fire with him. And then he might say something. Or he might not. Sometimes he might tell me a story. But it would always come out of this sense of absolute isolation and silence, and I guess just the atmosphere of that stayed with me, struck me as something important, I suppose.' </p> <p>McPherson is obsessive in his stage directions about pace. Phrases are punctuated with pauses and beats. His early plays, mostly monologues, were written like poetry. Each sentence occupying a line, building little formal silences into the rhythm of the piece. His writing retains that sense of speech as an anxious antidote to quiet. But if he learnt what he knows of silence from his grandfather, he adopted some of what he understands of dialogue from elsewhere. </p> <p>'As a young man, I just read David Mamet and tried to copy it. I was impressed just by the rate of that language, you know in Glengarry Glen Ross or something. Just the speed of that. And when you are 18 all that swearing is very exciting, I guess. So I wanted to capture some of that, too.' </p> <p>The other influence, or rather, he says, the other 'example' is, of course, Beckett. McPherson has been involved in Michael Colgan's epic effort to film all of the playwright's work. McPherson was one of the first directors Colgan approached, and he jumped at the opportunity to direct Endgame . 'People said that's because I was young,' he smiles. 'Many of the more experienced directors chose shorter stuff. But when you're 28 you say give me Godot , give me Endgame ...' </p> <p>He cast Michael Gambon and David Thewliss as Hamm and Clov, and relished the experience. 'The great thing about working with Gambon,' he says, 'is that he has like 300 stories to tell, all top-class things. So when there was a lull, and on a film there is always a lull, he'd just sit there and sort of spoof us with these stories. He also insisted on calling me \"Cunty McFuckface\", so that was grand...' </p> <p>The Beckett legacy is something he is slightly wary of, too. McPherson, along with the London-based Martin McDonagh, has been acclaimed as a natural heir to the great Irish playwrights. He does not mind the label if it sells tickets, but hopes that is as far as it goes. 'If people want to say there's a renaissance in this or that, that's great I guess, because it helps theatres to market plays in London.

      "bodyText": "In a rehearsal studio up a side alley, not far from the Liffey, Conor McPherson is in his element. He's listening to three generations of Irish actors talk about love, in words that are unmistakably his own: direct and exact and layered with deadpan lyricism. Even in a rough-edged read-through you feel shivers of recognition. Reticent and determined looking, McPherson describes what he wants to do as a playwright in very simple terms. He wants his sentences to 'paint clear pictures in people's heads'. His aim as a director is even more straightforward. 'I just want the actors to put their faith in the language,' he says, 'just let the words do the work.' McPherson has always made his craft look remarkably easy. His first notable play, This Lime Tree Bower, was rapturously received when he was only 23 and fresh out of University College, Dublin. It came complete with a mini-manifesto, a prefaced quote from Coleridge: 'No sound is dissonant which tells of life.' In the six years since he has kept rigorous faith in that idea, telling of life, with hardly a false note, in half a dozen plays and screenplays. With The Weir, a series of extraordinary haunted and haunting tales told in a remote bar in rural Ireland - a phenomenal success on Broadway and in the West End - he established himself as perhaps the pre-eminent narrative dramatist of his generation. And he shows no signs of letting up. He describes his new play, Port Authority, which we have been watching in rehearsal, as the most accomplished thing he has done. (He does this with a typical hesitant confidence - sure of his talent, unsure that he really wants to talk about it.) It is, in some ways, too, a distillation of what has gone before. 'The play is really three generations of Dublin men talking about how they face up to the responsibility of emotion,' he says. 'The three men could be related; they could be the same person. I don't know...' What he is sure about, characteristically, is the precise trajectory of the human feeling the men describe. The play suggests a progression of sorts, one that he sees as fundamental. 'The young person isn't certain that love can be real; the middle-aged man is only discovering that it is; and the older person seems so sure of it. I was interested in the way that many of us go through the whole of our lives staying with someone just out of complacency, because leaving isn't easy,' he says. 'It's about whether you are prepared to make yourself happy at the cost of someone else's happiness. And that's not just a personal or historical or psychological question. It's also a moral one.' It's tempting to suggest that Conor McPherson has had a formal training in this kind of dilemma. A postgraduate in ethics, he tutored students for a while in moral philosophy and planned to do a PhD (which, he says, slightly whimsically, is still a real possibility, 'a return to sanity'). His academic subject made him realise, 'above all, that I didn't know much about anything, and that none of us do'. But while this spirit may inform the comedy of his plays, their more poignant truths, he guesses, come from somewhere else. If McPherson's work has a recurrent theme, it is a fear of ending up on your own. 'I guess I'm attracted and repelled by isolation,' he says. 'It scares me. And it's why I tend to write about older characters, too, because for them the stakes are somewhat higher. You know, if you tell a person you're living with to go fuck themselves when you are 21, then you don't think too much of it; but if you say those same words near the end of your life, and then the person goes and walks out on you - where are you then?' Some of this sense of the fragility of communication which is at the heart of his best work, he learnt as a boy. McPherson grew up on a Dublin housing estate, his father taught accountancy, his mother worked in a shoe shop. In holidays and at weekends he would often go down on the train, alone, to visit his grandfather in Leitrim, the isolated setting for the barroom in The Weir. The remoteness of this other Ireland had a profound effect on him as a writer, he believes. 'My grandfather was there on his own,' McPherson recalls, nursing a post-rehearsal glass of Guinness. 'I was fairly quiet when I was a teenager, and I liked the way you could go down there and sit, you know, and not talk, really, and look at the fire with him. And then he might say something. Or he might not. Sometimes he might tell me a story. But it would always come out of this sense of absolute isolation and silence, and I guess just the atmosphere of that stayed with me, struck me as something important, I suppose.' McPherson is obsessive in his stage directions about pace. Phrases are punctuated with pauses and beats. His early plays, mostly monologues, were written like poetry. Each sentence occupying a line, building little formal silences into the rhythm of the piece. His writing retains that sense of speech as an anxious antidote to quiet. But if he learnt what he knows of silence from his grandfather, he adopted some of what he understands of dialogue from elsewhere. 'As a young man, I just read David Mamet and tried to copy it. I was impressed just by the rate of that language, you know in Glengarry Glen Ross or something. Just the speed of that. And when you are 18 all that swearing is very exciting, I guess. So I wanted to capture some of that, too.' The other influence, or rather, he says, the other 'example' is, of course, Beckett. McPherson has been involved in Michael Colgan's epic effort to film all of the playwright's work. McPherson was one of the first directors Colgan approached, and he jumped at the opportunity to direct Endgame . 'People said that's because I was young,' he smiles. 'Many of the more experienced directors chose shorter stuff. But when you're 28 you say give me Godot , give me Endgame ...' He cast Michael Gambon and David Thewliss as Hamm and Clov, and relished the experience. 'The great thing about working with Gambon,' he says, 'is that he has like 300 stories to tell, all top-class things. So when there was a lull, and on a film there is always a lull, he'd just sit there and sort of spoof us with these stories. He also insisted on calling me \"Cunty McFuckface\", so that was grand...' The Beckett legacy is something he is slightly wary of, too. McPherson, along with the London-based Martin McDonagh, has been acclaimed as a natural heir to the great Irish playwrights. He does not mind the label if it sells tickets, but hopes that is as far as it goes. 'If people want to say there's a renaissance in this or that, that's great I guess, because it helps theatres to market plays in London. But as a writer, you're not aware of it, and without it, anyway, I'd like to think my plays would find an audience...' I wonder if he felt a new weight of expectation after The Weir ? He thinks about it. 'That play was very good to me, certainly. For about a year after, I guess I was wondering, you know, what comes next? What did I do right? But that feeling did not last...' One of the things that did come next was an inevitable series of offers from Hollywood. McPherson was contracted to Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks to write a script for a film idea of Neil Jordan's.

Without a handful of influential players because of injury and suspension, they simply lack genuine menace. Celtic, the threatened target who now have a six-point lead over their city rivals in the SPL and will play their match in hand against Hearts at Tynecastle tonight, will be more concerned with their own form after the winter shutdown than anything they will have seen from their closest pursuers since the resumption of play last Wednesday night. But the Ibrox side's priorities begin and end with the gathering of points which will keep them within molesting distance of the leaders, the opportunity for which they will be offered next Sunday, when the Old Firm rivals collide at Celtic Park.

For half the battle in coaching is not what you know, but how you put it across. An incident after Boro's first game under Venables, a 1-0 win over Chelsea, was revealing. Venables came up for the press conference instead of Robson, and talked for 10 minutes or so about formations, tactics and substitutions. 'What a breath of fresh air,' a regular Boro watcher said as he left. 'He actually answered the questions.' This is a wild theory, a complete stab in the dark, but if something similar occurred to the Boro players when Venables walked in, it might go a long way to explaining the upturn.</p>",

For half the battle in coaching is not what you know, but how you put it across. An incident after Boro's first game under Venables, a 1-0 win over Chelsea, was revealing. Venables came up for the press conference instead of Robson, and talked for 10 minutes or so about formations, tactics and substitutions. 'What a breath of fresh air,' a regular Boro watcher said as he left. 'He actually answered the questions.' This is a wild theory, a complete stab in the dark, but if something similar occurred to the Boro players when Venables walked in, it might go a long way to explaining the upturn.",

In that period West Ham briefly flickered - Cole played Kanout\u00e9 through to bring a save from Westerveld and Frank Lampard shot at a defender after the goalkeeper had come off his line and lost the ball. Westerveld redeemed himself with a save from Lampard's deflected free-kick, but Liverpool snuffed out any prospect of a West Ham recovery by going straight to the other end and scoring again.

He had to scramble back and make a one-handed scoop away from the foot of the post. </p> <p>But Carlisle settled to construct a comfortable two-goal platform. </p> <p>It was midfielder Mark Soley who asked the first question of the Kidderminster defence when he came late into the box onto Lee Maddison's cross but his eighth-minute header went straight at the keeper. </p> <p>But a minute later the Cumbrians took the lead with a finely fashioned goal. </p> <p>Midfielder Richard Prokas chipped a ball from outside the box to Soley, whose cushioned volley found Dobie at the by-line and his low cross was made to measure for Ian Stevens to slot in from inside the six-yard box. </p> <p>Seven minutes later Carlisle scorned methodical build-up in favour of the much more direct route when Mark Birch's peach of a long ball - hit fully 60 yards - picked out Dobie up front. </p> <p>He chested down and his change of pace shook off defender Craig Hinton. Having beaten the defender with ease, he then sent a rocket of a shot past the Kidderminster keeper from 15 yards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, there was little for Glennon to do after that early scare. But he did have to move quickly in the 26th minute to turn a fine 20-yard drive from Broughton round the post for a corner. </p> <p>The halftime break revitalised Harriers and they started the second period brightly. Their renewed vigour put pressure on Carlisle, who were denied the time and room they had enjoyed in the first half. </p> <p>Service to the Carlisle front men dried up and Glennon had to be on his toes as a number of shots came his way. With Carlisle under a lot of pressure, Glennon was twice at full stretch to keep out midfielder Neil McKenzie. But both saves were topped by a stop from dangerman Drew Broughton 10 minutes from time. </p> <p><em>Ivor Broadis is a former Carlisle manager and England international.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "With a history of buying the club for a song and crudely enjoying the royalties, former Carlisle owner Michael Knighton must be aware of the form of Scott Dobie. In a team largely begged and borrowed by manager Ian Atkins, homebred Dobie is talented and young enough at 22 to be the one saleable asset. His goal and all-round work helped the Cumbrians to their sixth League game without defeat - their third win over Kidderminster this season after cup and League success away from home. It lifts them off the bottom of the Third Division, a position they've occupied since 4 November, and they are now a point better than Exeter with three games in hand. Kidderminster started brightly enough and in the second minute Carlisle's goalkeeper, Matty Glennon, appeared to misjudge Drew Broughton's header from Adie Smith's cross. He had to scramble back and make a one-handed scoop away from the foot of the post. But Carlisle settled to construct a comfortable two-goal platform. It was midfielder Mark Soley who asked the first question of the Kidderminster defence when he came late into the box onto Lee Maddison's cross but his eighth-minute header went straight at the keeper. But a minute later the Cumbrians took the lead with a finely fashioned goal. Midfielder Richard Prokas chipped a ball from outside the box to Soley, whose cushioned volley found Dobie at the by-line and his low cross was made to measure for Ian Stevens to slot in from inside the six-yard box. Seven minutes later Carlisle scorned methodical build-up in favour of the much more direct route when Mark Birch's peach of a long ball - hit fully 60 yards - picked out Dobie up front. He chested down and his change of pace shook off defender Craig Hinton. Having beaten the defender with ease, he then sent a rocket of a shot past the Kidderminster keeper from 15 yards. Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, there was little for Glennon to do after that early scare. But he did have to move quickly in the 26th minute to turn a fine 20-yard drive from Broughton round the post for a corner. The halftime break revitalised Harriers and they started the second period brightly. Their renewed vigour put pressure on Carlisle, who were denied the time and room they had enjoyed in the first half. Service to the Carlisle front men dried up and Glennon had to be on his toes as a number of shots came his way. With Carlisle under a lot of pressure, Glennon was twice at full stretch to keep out midfielder Neil McKenzie. But both saves were topped by a stop from dangerman Drew Broughton 10 minutes from time. Ivor Broadis is a former Carlisle manager and England international.",

On 7 December 1941, scores of Japanese planes screamed out of the Pacific sky to launch the most devastating attack ever on US military might. The raid on Pearl Harbour claimed 2,400 lives and forced America into the war.</p> <p>Almost 60 years later, bitter memories of the Japanese attack are being reopened by a Hollywood blockbuster that has prompted a ferocious onslaught from veterans and academics angered at what they believe to be a string of inaccuracies in the film.</p> <p>Pearl Harbor, released this summer, will be the most expensive film ever made, outstripping Titanic by millions of pounds. Starring British actress Kate Beckinsale and Ben Affleck, the film will tell the story of how two heroic pilots battled to repel the Japanese bombers.</p> <p>But Hollywood scriptwriters again stand accused of re-writing history. Following furious rows over films such as The Patriot and Braveheart, war veterans have dimissed Pearl Harbor as a 'disgusting representation' of the facts. One survivor, a veteran of a Japanese prison camp, snapped: 'It makes me so angry because so many guys died there. I went out on a suicide mission. I watched guys being carried by, bleeding on stretchers, and guys diving into burning oil. It's disgusting to do this.'</p> <p>The script for the film has been written by Randall Wallace, who also wrote the Mel Gibson blockbuster Braveheart, branded a 'ludicrous send-up of Scottish history'.

      "bodyText": "It was a turning point of the Second World War. On 7 December 1941, scores of Japanese planes screamed out of the Pacific sky to launch the most devastating attack ever on US military might. The raid on Pearl Harbour claimed 2,400 lives and forced America into the war. Almost 60 years later, bitter memories of the Japanese attack are being reopened by a Hollywood blockbuster that has prompted a ferocious onslaught from veterans and academics angered at what they believe to be a string of inaccuracies in the film. Pearl Harbor, released this summer, will be the most expensive film ever made, outstripping Titanic by millions of pounds. Starring British actress Kate Beckinsale and Ben Affleck, the film will tell the story of how two heroic pilots battled to repel the Japanese bombers. But Hollywood scriptwriters again stand accused of re-writing history. Following furious rows over films such as The Patriot and Braveheart, war veterans have dimissed Pearl Harbor as a 'disgusting representation' of the facts. One survivor, a veteran of a Japanese prison camp, snapped: 'It makes me so angry because so many guys died there. I went out on a suicide mission. I watched guys being carried by, bleeding on stretchers, and guys diving into burning oil. It's disgusting to do this.' The script for the film has been written by Randall Wallace, who also wrote the Mel Gibson blockbuster Braveheart, branded a 'ludicrous send-up of Scottish history'. Wallace has admitted that 'the story [in the film of Pearl Harbour] of the raid is not the heart of this tale. You've got to be impressionistic rather than have exact details.' The film will hit movie screens worldwide in May, cashing in on nostalgia for the event that will culminate in its 60th anniversary later this year.

      "body": "<p>Simon Gray was elated when he learnt he was to be published by Faber and Faber. It was the fulfilment of all his early literary aspirations and meant joining the hallowed Bloomsbury haunt of W.H. Auden, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. </p> <p>In public, however, Gray and his fellow authors on the Faber list - Harold Pinter, P.D. James and Alan Bennett - feigned indifference to the kudos bestowed by their illustrious publishing house. In his diaries he recalls how often they complained about low advances and inefficient business practices, typically remarking that Faber was 'a bit too gentlemanly, but one wouldn't dream of leaving them'. </p> <p>Recent critics have not been so indulgent. In literary circles the suspicion is that the last things Faber could be accused of nowadays is 'gentlemanly' behaviour. The sudden resignation last week of Toby Faber, the company's 35-year-old managing director, followed revelations in The Observer that he had sent out ill-judged demands for money to the widows of the playwright John Osborne and the writer Stephen Spender. The bluntly phrased letters belatedly requested repayment of advances their husbands had received for unfinished work before their deaths. Publishing protocol dictates that these matters are handled by a discreet phone call and are certainly not left to the last legally-binding moment. </p> <p>As word of the strange letters spread, playwrights David Hare and Harold Pinter took up the cudgels behind the scenes. This was not the way to treat the widows of two of the best known names in the Faber back catalogue. What could be going on? Faber ought to get its house in order as its 75th birthday loomed. </p> <p>The demands for cash hinted there were financial problems, too. John Lanchester had received \u00a3300,000 for his novel, Mr Phillips , but it had not sold as well as expected. Gordon Burns had been wooed with a substantial sum for his work on the West killings, Happy Like Murderer s, and Jane Smiley had been paid well over the Faber odds for her book Horse Heaven , which also underperformed. Whitaker Booktrack confirms that of the expensive hoped-for frontrunners, only Happy Like Murderers made it into the top 5,000 sellers in 1999 and 2000. But Faber has done much better in its traditional areas of dominance. Last year the poet Seamus Heaney's Beowulf was the top title in the literature and poetry category, and in 1999 the late Ted Hughes's Birthday Letters pulled off the same trick. (Eyebrows were raised, however, when the poems of Sir Paul McCartney were recently added to the otherwise pace-setting poetry catalogue.) </p> <p>Faber has been going through a period of internal restructuring and commercial realignment, but both Toby Faber and his chairman, Lord Evans, deny things have got out of hand. Faber, who was the only founding family member on the payroll, had been brought in five years ago to manage the reorganisation but appears to have quickly fallen out of love with the book business. He may have had the right surname, but was his consultancy background, as a former 'McKinsey man', the right training for a career in publishing? </p> <p>'When I came into Faber I was very much taking a management view of things,' he told The Observer this weekend. 'I recognised that my experience was not in editorial - that was not where my skills lay. Unfortunately I have come to realise that the management of Faber alone is not exciting enough in itself, although I have done some exciting things at Faber over the last few years. What I realise is, it is not enough.' </p> <p>The son of T.E. Faber, a Cambridge physicist in his seventies who still chairs the parent company, the outgoing Faber has a fairly solid claim to having improved the financial standing of the family firm. 'For the last four years we have been profitable, apart from two years ago when we took a planned loss because of the closure of our warehouse in Harlow,' he said. </p> <p>Faber made a loss before tax of \u00a3627,000 in the year ending March 1999 and yet by March 2000 it was in profit by \u00a3256,000. </p> <p>He denies that his decision to leave had anything to do with the letters sent out to the widows Osborne and Spender. 'There is no link between the letters and my resignation,' he says. 'Although I would prefer it had not happened at the same time. Repayment is always a sensitive issue.' </p> <p>Others are not so convinced, among them Helen Osborne herself. She said: 'It seems a bit of a coincidence that they have both happened within a few days. It may be a minor factor, but I have been given the message that the letter was an error and I think it was the final embarrassment.' </p> <p>She learnt last week from her friend David Hare that her own \u00a320,000 'debt' has now been waived. The playwright said he had won assurances on the matter from Lord Evans, who has temporarily stepped back into his old managing director's job. </p> <p>The influential literary agent Deborah Rogers retains her faith in Faber, although she admits to being surprised by the resignation. 'It is reassuring that Matthew (Evans) will still be around for the time being. Publishing was new to Toby Faber - I know it was his family firm, but possibly it wasn't really natural to him.' </p> <p>Within Faber, some staff suspect the young pretender was disappointed by the lack of glamour. There is also still a sense of shock about the 'weird' cash demands he sent out. 'They went against the core of what Faber is supposed to stand for,' said one. </p> <p>Lord Evans, or Matthew Evans, as he prefers, has recently been given the job of reorganising Britain's museums as chairman of Resource. He also sits on the Labour benches of the House of Lords alongside Lords Bragg and Winston. 'I am holding the fort while we find a new managing director,' he said this weekend. 'I have been working at Faber during the mornings and the early afternoon and then I do a bit at Resource and then on to the House of Lords for the evening. But I was managing director myself for 15 years, so I do know the business.' </p> <p>Evans put rumours of discord down to the 'bitchy world of publishing'. He added: 'The letters Toby sent were a mistake and that has been said now. Critics leap on Faber out of jealousy of our status, and in the early days we played up to that. There was a superior, snobby attitude here that I hope I have managed to dispel. </p> <p>'Toby made some important structural changes, but, because of the kind of company we are, we walk on a knife edge and I am used to that. We have to compete as one of the few remaining independents still in competition with all the corporate conglomerates.' </p> <p>Evans argues that the money spent on big advances was not misjudged either. 'It is true we moved away from never paying out sums like that, but Mr Phillips is part of a two-book contract and John Lanchester is absolute gold dust as far as the Faber backlist is concerned. With Horse Heaven we anticipate at least clearing the advance in the mass-market paperback stage.' </p> <p>The company, he believes, will always have one big advantage: its supportive and informed shareholders, chief among whom is T.S. Eliots' widow, Valerie. 'The money from the musical Cats has been enormously helpful to us over the years as a way of rebuilding ourselves. During the 1970s and 1980s we might well have been gobbled up if we had not had Cats .' </p> <p>Poetry in general, far from being a problem, has proved a solution. 'The great untold story is that the market for poetry is much better than everybody thinks,' said Evans. 'We have to keep on doing the things we do best.' </p> <p>Faber remains a literary force in the land, as the former Faber poetry editor, Craig Raine, testifies. 'It is a fantastically distinguished publishing house. It was always the Faber catalogue that you pulled out first to see what was coming and, to be honest, it still is.' </p> <p>Even those who have fallen out with Evans seem to come to an accommodation over time. Simon Gray was furious when he discovered his play The Late Middle Classes would not be published by Faber unless it had a West End run. An exchange of stiff letters followed and finally Evans let it slip that Gray had only been taken on by Faber all those years ago because of his friendship with Pinter. </p> <p>'I'd been bait for the larger prey, the worm for the fish,' a wounded Gray says he realised, before concluding that Evans had been in the right all along. </p> <p>Rival publisher Patrick Janson-Smith, managing director of Transworld, believes the survival of the house of Faber 'has always been a game of mirrors'. 'It is very influential in a small literary circle,' he says. </p> <p>'Faber is a destination house for a certain kind of author, but there are quite a lot of authors they have undersold.' </p> <p><strong>Cover to cover</strong></p> <p><strong> The moneyspinners:</strong><br>Birthday Letters , Ted Hughes <br> Beowulf , Seamus Heaney <br> The True History of the Kelly Gang , Peter Carey </p> <p><strong> The disappointments:</strong> <br> Horse Heaven , Jane Smiley <br> Mr Phillips , John Lanchester <br> Happy Like Murderers , Gordon Burns </p> <p><strong> The catalogue's jewels:</strong> <br>Alan Bennett <br>Harold Pinter <br>T.S.

      "body": "<p>For those who live in hope of seeing Celtic regain pre-eminence in Scottish football, February may be crucial. It is hardly dramatising the Parkhead side's prospects to claim that a 21-day period which contains league matches against their two closest challengers, a CIS League Cup semi-final with Rangers and a Tennents Scottish Cup tie away to Dunfermline or St Johnstone looms as a confrontation with destiny. </p> <p>Even Martin O'Neill was moved to say: 'It's not just the nature of the games, all of them big occasions, but the fact that they cover the three competitions. Rangers on Wednesday in the League Cup, then again in the league on Sunday, followed the next week by the Scottish Cup, then Hibs once again in the SPL. </p> <p>'It's a big month all right and the picture should be a lot clearer afterwards. If it's not, then March will be a big month, too.' </p> <p>Those rigorous examinations begins tonight, when Celtic travel to meet Hearts in the league which could, like the opening minutes of a championship fight, establish the course the contest will follow. This is an assignment which should not intimidate O'Neill's players, who have scored 15 goals in three previous encounters with Hearts. </p> <p>But the uncertainty over sharpness and form which follows the winter shutdown lends an unmistakable precariousness to the fixture. 'A lot of people will be watching to see if we still have the momentum we had before the break,' said O'Neill. 'And, to be honest, we have to find out for ourselves, too. But the Scottish Cup tie against Stranraer last Sunday was a great help.' </p> <p>The comfort of Celtic's 4-1 victory even against Second Division opposition would re-assure O'Neill's players, although midfielder Alan Thompson is adamant that there is no problem with their confidence. </p> <p>'I don't think there is any doubt we have the character to sustain it,' said Thompson. 'Nobody is getting carried away here, and the manager sets the frame of mind at a club - it's the same everywhere - and anybody can see that Martin O'Neill's attitude rubs off on us. You won't hear any of our fellas talking about what they're going to do. </p> <p>'But there is no lack of confidence. Everybody here is expecting great things, not because of making assumptions, but because of our self-belief.' </p> <p>The last time Celtic played Hearts, at home on 18 November, the visitors opened the scoring in the first half and were subsequently terrorised, losing 6-1.

      "bodyText": "For those who live in hope of seeing Celtic regain pre-eminence in Scottish football, February may be crucial. It is hardly dramatising the Parkhead side's prospects to claim that a 21-day period which contains league matches against their two closest challengers, a CIS League Cup semi-final with Rangers and a Tennents Scottish Cup tie away to Dunfermline or St Johnstone looms as a confrontation with destiny. Even Martin O'Neill was moved to say: 'It's not just the nature of the games, all of them big occasions, but the fact that they cover the three competitions. Rangers on Wednesday in the League Cup, then again in the league on Sunday, followed the next week by the Scottish Cup, then Hibs once again in the SPL. 'It's a big month all right and the picture should be a lot clearer afterwards. If it's not, then March will be a big month, too.' Those rigorous examinations begins tonight, when Celtic travel to meet Hearts in the league which could, like the opening minutes of a championship fight, establish the course the contest will follow. This is an assignment which should not intimidate O'Neill's players, who have scored 15 goals in three previous encounters with Hearts. But the uncertainty over sharpness and form which follows the winter shutdown lends an unmistakable precariousness to the fixture. 'A lot of people will be watching to see if we still have the momentum we had before the break,' said O'Neill. 'And, to be honest, we have to find out for ourselves, too. But the Scottish Cup tie against Stranraer last Sunday was a great help.' The comfort of Celtic's 4-1 victory even against Second Division opposition would re-assure O'Neill's players, although midfielder Alan Thompson is adamant that there is no problem with their confidence. 'I don't think there is any doubt we have the character to sustain it,' said Thompson. 'Nobody is getting carried away here, and the manager sets the frame of mind at a club - it's the same everywhere - and anybody can see that Martin O'Neill's attitude rubs off on us. You won't hear any of our fellas talking about what they're going to do. 'But there is no lack of confidence. Everybody here is expecting great things, not because of making assumptions, but because of our self-belief.' The last time Celtic played Hearts, at home on 18 November, the visitors opened the scoring in the first half and were subsequently terrorised, losing 6-1. It is a piece of evidence that corroborates Thompson's testimony, but O'Neill added his own support. 'What Alan said about our players' attitude is not only right, but very important. There is great belief among the players here and it will be needed in these testing weeks. So far, they could not have been more impressive in passing tests of character. 'I've said all along that, if it was to come down to a 14-game league after the break, I would be absolutely delighted to have a one-point lead,' he said.

      "body": "<p>It started with a simple invitation from a sports equipment manufacturer to meet Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and enjoy an hour talking to him about young players and their development. It ended up being a tortuous journey through the corridors of power of the varied and vested interests in football and its myriad bodies. </p> <p>What it revealed is that the English game is at a crossroads, its development at a pivotal moment. If it is not careful, politics, power struggles and personalities are in danger of splitting the sport to the detriment of young players, some of whom may go on to help restore the national team's fortunes, but most of whom simply want to enjoy the game and be given a lifelong love of it. </p> <p>It is not a story about lack of money or resources. Through the FA and the England team, through the Premiership, through sponsorship and through government, it seems there is an abundance of cash (tens of millions, and counting). Rather, it is about squabbling over how best to spend it. </p> <p>The story encompasses politicians, the FA, the English Schools FA, county associations, and new bodies called the Football Foundation and the National Game Board. It is about whether all the various organisations can pick their way through mistrust and self-interest and can be reconciled as they fight their corners, for the good of football. Or whether it is time for the Government to bang heads together and take more control. </p> <p>To begin at the beginning: some 10 days ago, Wenger took part in a launch by Nike of their new coaching initiative for primary schools. </p> <p>'In my experience of going around the world,' he said, 'England loves football more than anybody. But school-wise it is behind everybody. There is no uniformity, no consistency over the whole country.' </p> <p>He was happy, he added, to endorse Nike's scheme, because of the quality of teaching and coaching it was providing at the pre-club academy stage. 'Every age is important. You miss that stage, you will never get it back.' It is one reason, he believes, why the quality of young English players has suffered for so long. </p> <p>Evidence came from his young defender Matthew Upson, who had experienced a rocky road to becoming a professional. Rejected by a club at 12, he found county schools football 'a shambles' and things that were being taught him were 'just so wrong'. </p> <p>The Nike FC scheme, developed over the past few years by a respected German coach, Horst Wein, aims to help hard-pressed teachers to lay on better sessions for kids. Nike have initially appointed coaching directors in London and Manchester, and will also work with 'their' clubs, including Leeds and Sunderland, in local community schemes. Around \u00a31 million is earmarked for the initiative this year, the first of at least three. </p> <p>Last week, Nike held roadshow days in Norwich, Hastings and Portsmouth, the main aim to give teachers help in avoiding sessions that become nothing more than child-minding hours. 'We realise that we will have to go to them,' says Nike's Brian Marwood, the former Arsenal player and PFA community officer. </p> <p>As someone who coaches schoolkids, I can see the scheme's value. The training routines are innovative and should help increase expertise among the likes of me, women teachers who are more and more pressed into action, along with the dwindling number of male - and often reluctant - colleagues, thus increasing pupils' knowledge and enjoyment. </p> <p>Just to ask where Nike's plans sit with existing initiatives, though, is to open a whole can of worms that illustrates why the English game has been pulling itself apart, rather than together, for a decade and more. </p> <p>Already in place is the Schools Football Initiative, once sponsored by adidas but relaunched, with a new three-year deal, by Umbro just before Christmas. It, too, aims to help teachers as much as kids. 'Only eight per cent of teachers in primary schools have qualifications in any sport, about one per cent in football,' says SFI's national co-ordinator, Phil Darren. </p> <p>He and Nike are clearly covering much of the same ground, differing in that SFI uses CD-rom material for the teachers and also helps schools organise fundraising days to buy discounted equipment. SFI, now in their seventh year, have nine regional coaches, all FA-qualified and with clearance from the police to work with children, as well as a host of part-timers. </p> <p>They plan to reach 1,200 schools this year and are to be endorsed by the ESFA once contractual details have been finalised. 'The aim is to develop children individually, co-operatively and competitively,' says Darren. </p> <p>He is a brave man. Half an hour after outlining his scheme to me, Darren rang me back. 'I may have been wearing my commercial hat,' he said. 'I am a teacher first and what I really want to say is that I would love it if there was one scheme. It wouldn't be rocket science for the ESFA and the FA to have a single strategy.' The unformity Wenger speaks of. </p> <p>One problem for teachers is knowing which way to turn. Even being offered things for free, they are often reluctant to embrace commercial companies. They have enough bickering over designer sportswear in the playground, and even Nike and Umbro have to admit that their altruism is underpinned by the need to promote their brand in the playground. </p> <p>Darren believes the problem could be resolved. 'If a number of different companies could support elements of a programme, one from ages seven to 11, one from 11 to 16, then there wouldn't be a problem. There should be cooperation between the FA and the ESFA to devise a technical programme from five to 16 for the good of the game.' </p> <p>Here, politics intrude too. For years there has been acrimony between the FA and the ESFA. The FA have believed they are the experts in developing players, the schools feel they can provide expertise as well as education. 'Have you seen the FA's coaching manual?' one schools coach asked me. 'Every page is full of text and diagrams with just a rectangle and a goal at each end. There's nothing creative, no interesting drills to make the game fun.' </p> <p>This rift between professionals and amateurs fuels FA fears that the pro game is not getting the quality of players it should, while the ESFA fear that the system will eat up and discard the majority, who are not receiving the best coaching anyway. They have had little faith in some of the personalities within the FA's technical department to the extent that some senior figures in both organisations have refused to talk to each other. </p> <p>The acrimony came to a head two years ago when the FA took control of the England under-15 team, who begin, next Friday, a four-team international tournament against Spain, Germany and Holland, to be played at Rushden, Crawley and Southend. It remains a bone of contention. </p> <p>'They should be under us,' says John Read, the new ESFA chief executive. 'They are all schoolboys. We would be willing to work with FA coaches. They may say that we are not the best coaches but we may be the most appropriate.' </p> <p>Read took up the post only a month ago, charged with bringing more harmony into dealings with the FA. Just as Adam Crozier is seen as a new broom, so is Read at the ESFA, having once been a sports teacher and also an FA Councillor, as representative of the RAF, in which he served as a PE instructor. </p> <p>'Talks are in their early stages but for the first time in many years, we are talking the same language,' he insists. It is partly out of necessity given the clear interest of the government - more particularly the Minister of Sport Kate Hoey - in where the money is going.

      "bodyText": "It started with a simple invitation from a sports equipment manufacturer to meet Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and enjoy an hour talking to him about young players and their development. It ended up being a tortuous journey through the corridors of power of the varied and vested interests in football and its myriad bodies. What it revealed is that the English game is at a crossroads, its development at a pivotal moment. If it is not careful, politics, power struggles and personalities are in danger of splitting the sport to the detriment of young players, some of whom may go on to help restore the national team's fortunes, but most of whom simply want to enjoy the game and be given a lifelong love of it. It is not a story about lack of money or resources. Through the FA and the England team, through the Premiership, through sponsorship and through government, it seems there is an abundance of cash (tens of millions, and counting). Rather, it is about squabbling over how best to spend it. The story encompasses politicians, the FA, the English Schools FA, county associations, and new bodies called the Football Foundation and the National Game Board. It is about whether all the various organisations can pick their way through mistrust and self-interest and can be reconciled as they fight their corners, for the good of football. Or whether it is time for the Government to bang heads together and take more control. To begin at the beginning: some 10 days ago, Wenger took part in a launch by Nike of their new coaching initiative for primary schools. 'In my experience of going around the world,' he said, 'England loves football more than anybody. But school-wise it is behind everybody. There is no uniformity, no consistency over the whole country.' He was happy, he added, to endorse Nike's scheme, because of the quality of teaching and coaching it was providing at the pre-club academy stage. 'Every age is important. You miss that stage, you will never get it back.' It is one reason, he believes, why the quality of young English players has suffered for so long. Evidence came from his young defender Matthew Upson, who had experienced a rocky road to becoming a professional. Rejected by a club at 12, he found county schools football 'a shambles' and things that were being taught him were 'just so wrong'. The Nike FC scheme, developed over the past few years by a respected German coach, Horst Wein, aims to help hard-pressed teachers to lay on better sessions for kids. Nike have initially appointed coaching directors in London and Manchester, and will also work with 'their' clubs, including Leeds and Sunderland, in local community schemes. Around \u00a31 million is earmarked for the initiative this year, the first of at least three. Last week, Nike held roadshow days in Norwich, Hastings and Portsmouth, the main aim to give teachers help in avoiding sessions that become nothing more than child-minding hours. 'We realise that we will have to go to them,' says Nike's Brian Marwood, the former Arsenal player and PFA community officer. As someone who coaches schoolkids, I can see the scheme's value. The training routines are innovative and should help increase expertise among the likes of me, women teachers who are more and more pressed into action, along with the dwindling number of male - and often reluctant - colleagues, thus increasing pupils' knowledge and enjoyment. Just to ask where Nike's plans sit with existing initiatives, though, is to open a whole can of worms that illustrates why the English game has been pulling itself apart, rather than together, for a decade and more. Already in place is the Schools Football Initiative, once sponsored by adidas but relaunched, with a new three-year deal, by Umbro just before Christmas. It, too, aims to help teachers as much as kids. 'Only eight per cent of teachers in primary schools have qualifications in any sport, about one per cent in football,' says SFI's national co-ordinator, Phil Darren. He and Nike are clearly covering much of the same ground, differing in that SFI uses CD-rom material for the teachers and also helps schools organise fundraising days to buy discounted equipment. SFI, now in their seventh year, have nine regional coaches, all FA-qualified and with clearance from the police to work with children, as well as a host of part-timers. They plan to reach 1,200 schools this year and are to be endorsed by the ESFA once contractual details have been finalised. 'The aim is to develop children individually, co-operatively and competitively,' says Darren. He is a brave man. Half an hour after outlining his scheme to me, Darren rang me back. 'I may have been wearing my commercial hat,' he said. 'I am a teacher first and what I really want to say is that I would love it if there was one scheme. It wouldn't be rocket science for the ESFA and the FA to have a single strategy.' The unformity Wenger speaks of. One problem for teachers is knowing which way to turn. Even being offered things for free, they are often reluctant to embrace commercial companies. They have enough bickering over designer sportswear in the playground, and even Nike and Umbro have to admit that their altruism is underpinned by the need to promote their brand in the playground. Darren believes the problem could be resolved. 'If a number of different companies could support elements of a programme, one from ages seven to 11, one from 11 to 16, then there wouldn't be a problem. There should be cooperation between the FA and the ESFA to devise a technical programme from five to 16 for the good of the game.' Here, politics intrude too. For years there has been acrimony between the FA and the ESFA. The FA have believed they are the experts in developing players, the schools feel they can provide expertise as well as education. 'Have you seen the FA's coaching manual?' one schools coach asked me. 'Every page is full of text and diagrams with just a rectangle and a goal at each end. There's nothing creative, no interesting drills to make the game fun.' This rift between professionals and amateurs fuels FA fears that the pro game is not getting the quality of players it should, while the ESFA fear that the system will eat up and discard the majority, who are not receiving the best coaching anyway. They have had little faith in some of the personalities within the FA's technical department to the extent that some senior figures in both organisations have refused to talk to each other. The acrimony came to a head two years ago when the FA took control of the England under-15 team, who begin, next Friday, a four-team international tournament against Spain, Germany and Holland, to be played at Rushden, Crawley and Southend. It remains a bone of contention. 'They should be under us,' says John Read, the new ESFA chief executive. 'They are all schoolboys. We would be willing to work with FA coaches. They may say that we are not the best coaches but we may be the most appropriate.' Read took up the post only a month ago, charged with bringing more harmony into dealings with the FA. Just as Adam Crozier is seen as a new broom, so is Read at the ESFA, having once been a sports teacher and also an FA Councillor, as representative of the RAF, in which he served as a PE instructor. 'Talks are in their early stages but for the first time in many years, we are talking the same language,' he insists. It is partly out of necessity given the clear interest of the government - more particularly the Minister of Sport Kate Hoey - in where the money is going. Which is where the Football Foundation comes in. Lacking full confidence in the FA, the government set up the Foundation, chaired by the Labour MP Tom Pendrie and involving such as Garth Crooks and Trevor Brooking, to administer the sizeable funds. The money comes in via Sport England, as well as FA and Premier League television deals. It is estimated that \u00a326m will be available for the grassroots game this year, \u00a340m next and up to \u00a360m the year after. Therein comes the squabbling.

      "body": "<p>Michael Knighton, the one-time ball-juggling nearly man of Manchester United, is now - by his own admission - 'the most reviled man in Cumbria' and apparently out of football after a turbulent eight years as owner of Carlisle United, who started the weekend as the League's bottom club. </p> <p>A decade after he almost bought the biggest club in the world for \u00a310 million he is now the subject of parliamentary questions into whether he has really severed links with Carlisle. An attempt to sell 25 per cent of his shares ended in farce when purchaser Stephen Brown was unmasked as bogus - a curry-house barman - five months after the DTI barred Knighton from company directorships for five years. Still dogging him, too, is the infamous episode when he apparently saw an alien spaceship. </p> <p>So is he mad, bad, dangerous to know? Or is he - as he would have it - misunderstood, maligned and a sharp businessman getting the best for his investment? Judge for yourselves. </p> <p><strong> Do you think football club chairmen are too often abused?</strong> </p> <p>I have to tell you that if we were black or some minority group then there would be an outcry. And chairmen are a minority group because there are only 72 of them in the Football League. </p> <p>Why have 80 per cent of these football clubs changed hands over the past five to 10 years... and continue to change hands? The local butcher, baker and candlestick maker don't want to come forward any more. And the reason is the unbelievable abuse they receive. Fans are much more proactive, they will all boycott the chairman's pies or puddings; they'll boycott car showrooms. The days of Bob Lord, the Burnley butcher, running his local club have gone forever. People like that just don't want the aggravation. </p> <p>They know that even limited success does not guarantee anything. I thought I had fabulous success at Carlisle for five of my eight years yet it's safe to say that I am the most reviled man in Cumbria... because of what's happened at the club. And because local journalists perpetuate the notion that the club is under-resourced, and the reason it's under-resourced is down to the man at the top who won't spend the money. And the reason he won't spend the money is that he is interested only in his own pocket. Keep saying that long enough and they will believe it. </p> <p><strong> Questions have been asked in parliament about the ownership of Carlisle United and whether you have really sold up. Mamcarr, who have apparently bought 60 per cent of your stake, are said to be four members of a Gibraltar law firm acting as a shell for the real owner. Who are they?</strong> </p> <p>People no longer want to go 'up front'. They want to feel their way carefully in case it goes terribly wrong. Something like 25 per cent of all football clubs have a significant part of their ownership held by offshore companies. Chelsea, Leicester, Huddersfield Town are just some, there are many more. It's not such a big mystery. Mamcarr have said, 'We are not Michael Knighton, he is not the beneficial owner; he is not a shareholder or a director.' They've said all that. What more do they [critics] want? </p> <p>What they want is some bastard to come along so they can throw stones at him when it all goes wrong. </p> <p><strong> It's said Mamcarr is an acronym based on your family's initials - your wife and children.</strong> </p> <p>A family acronym? Listen it could be Carr's biscuits or Manchester and Carlisle or Mediterannean or whatever. They [local critics] can have all these fairytales. The real reason is staring them in the face. Any shrewd investor is looking at this and saying, 'I'm having a go but I don't want the baggage and crap that goes with it. Don't give me all this shit when we lose six games on the bounce.' My family and I are not involved and I'm happy to go on record saying that. Anyway, the deal is conditional on the approval of Her Majesty's Inland Revenue and the Football League. Anyone in their right mind will see this is a proper deal. It's not a sham. I'd have thought Mamcarr will go public within 60 days. Me? I am walking away. I've already drawn a line under it. I don't know what might happen in 20 years time, but, as far as Carlisle and football is concerned, the line has been drawn. </p> <p><strong> And what of the bogus buyer of 25 per cent of your shares, Stephen Brown, the curry-house barman who disappeared?</strong> </p> <p>To say he was full of the brown stuff is an understatement. He approached me on 20 July. Within 10 minutes of our meeting, he said he had sold a hotel in Spain for \u00a36.3 million and wanted to come into football. I only met the man four or five times and he did nothing but boast about how wealthy he was. Some self-made men are a bit like that - I've come across them before. He was incredibly boastful and rather distasteful in the way he talked of his wealth... I can only say that guy is at best foolish and in need of a psychiatrist or at worst he is a cunning con-man who has been rumbled. </p> <p><strong> You, of all people perhaps, should have spotted him?</strong> </p> <p>I looked him in the eye when he told me he'd sold his hotel for \u00a36.3 million and others corroborated his story. Is he a Walter Mitty? That's too kind. I think there is a certain charm in Walter Mitty. Mr Brown is more dangerous than Walter Mitty. </p> <p><strong> Going back to the abuse aimed at chairmen, how bad was it for you?</strong> </p> <p>I am a strong character. I'm never intimidated physically or mentally. But when it gets to your family, when your children are bullied at school, that's when it does get to me. </p> <p>My son suffered on a pretty serious scale for the best part of a year and never said a word. Then it all came out. He came home from school black and blue one day, bruising all over his back - that's when it came out. Older boys were beating him up and he was only 11 or 12. That is unforgivable. Nothing is more important than your family and when that happened I made it known within a week that my shares at Carlisle were available. </p> <p><strong> Why are you disqualified from being a company director by the DTI? Anything to do with the football club?</strong> </p> <p>It's a technical disqualification which I did not contest concerning a school in Huddersfield I owned. Nothing to do with the football club. It relates to matters 10 years ago. </p> <p><strong> So would you give the club away, something you are reported to have said?</strong> </p> <p>I've been ridiculed in the local paper for offering the club to them for \u00a31 for them to manage, in conjunction with the city council. They said it was a 'bizarre' offer; they think it proves I really am insane. But why? They're a huge company, they make a \u00a32.5 million net annual profit, so why don't they do it? All they are prepared to do is tell you which manager to appoint, when to appoint him; how much to pay him; when to buy players; when to sell them and generally how to run your business. </p> <p><strong> But you've spectacularly failed to deliver what you promised - a Premiership club in seven years?</strong> </p> <p>No question about it. I didn't deliver on the pitch. I delivered off the pitch, too well. We made massive profits but we had a \u00a33 million stand to pay for. </p> <p><strong> What about the controversial sacking of your manager, Mervyn Day, now assistant at Charlton, in 1997?</strong> </p> <p>I made some good decisions and some bad decisions in football. One of my good decisions was sacking Mervyn Day. </p> <p><strong> It has also been suggested that you have left with the football club being owed money by your own holding company, CUFC Holdings.</strong> </p> <p>That's utter rubbish. That's down to journalists, amateurs, who can't read balance sheets. They add two and two and get 1,000 and then print it. For the majority of my time at Carlisle, 80 per cent of it, more than \u00a31 million was owed by the football club to the holding company. The minute the inter-company account went the other way, it was on the front page. Knowing what funds have been injected by the holding company over the past two months, the football club is again owing money to the holding company. But what's the big deal? They are one and the same thing - the holding company owns 93 per cent of the football club. All this is absolutely standard procedure... so now do you understand why buyers want to remain offshore? </p> <p>On the Friday before our last game in 1999, with our League status on the line, this headline is run: 'Knighton makes \u00a31.4 million profit'. That's their line - Knighton makes the profit, not Carlisle. And Knighton spends only \u00a3100,000 on players. You tell me that is not mischievous. They'll say it's fair journalism. Bollocks. Absolute bollocks. I don't think I've under-resourced the club. Our record wage bill was for the year we almost lost our League status and it's still \u00a3900,000 a year on gates of 2,500. But there comes a time when you have to change chairman and you have to change your directors. You have to move on. Only then will they perhaps give someone a new start. </p> <p><strong> You've had eight years at Carlisle - how do you see the League in another eight years?</strong> </p> <p>We've got to get rid of the stigma of the trapdoor, the loss of Football League status. The quicker they make the Conference an official Fourth Division, the better. And the quicker they say to the Premier League, can we have another \u00a320 million, because we shall need that now to make it the official Fourth Division, the better. </p> <p><strong> You are saying your spell as 'team manager' in 1998-99 was press invention?</strong> </p> <p>After Mervyn Day, I wanted Peter Beardsley to be our new manager but he was under contract at the time. It was decided to appoint our coaches as joint managers but they wanted a 'front' - they were not happy with that side of the job. I had been a PE teacher, I'd been interested in sports science all my life and I'm an ex-professional player. So I said: 'I'll do the press - I'll take the responsibility if it all goes wrong.' But I didn't put on one coaching session and I never gave one team talk. The press were told that. But it suited their agenda for me to be interfering... just a meddling, overweight chairman playing out his Roy-of-the-Rovers fantasy. </p> <p><strong> But promising the Premiership in seven years?</strong> </p> <p>I would rather reach for the stars and hit the moon - and we hit the moon. That club had been going for the best part of a century and never dreamed of Wembley's twin towers. We went twice in five years - and won it [Auto Windscreens Trophy] once. Carlisle had won one silver pot in its history before I arrived and we won two pots in five years [that trophy and the Third Division title]. I don't regret anything. It's a dream business. </p> <p><strong> What do you think now about your time as a director of Manchester United - and your attempt to buy the club?</strong> </p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a director. My views, my blueprint, were regarded as far too optimistic by some at the time. In fact, they've gone on and outstripped even what I thought was possible. And \u00a310 million for United doesn't look a bad deal now, does it? Of course people said I didn't have the money. Well I did have it, always had and the Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed I had it - and so did Martin Edwards. </p> <p>Robert Maxwell, who wanted to buy United, gave me a going over in the Daily Mirror but I could not believe it when I heard about his death. Then you start to appreciate what was happening at the time. </p> <p>I firmly believe Maxwell intended to pay back the pension fund. You see the scenario, his gearing was sky-high in the middle of a recession with a Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, saying, 'There is no recession', and the reality was that banks were calling in overdrafts. He probably intended to pay back the pension fund having used the money to buy his own company shares and increase the value of his firms. He ran out of time. They were ready to knock on his door before he could do it... so he jumped. </p> <p>I made it my business to find out about the auction of Maxwell memorabilia after his death. I decided, whatever Lot No 1 was at the auction I'd buy it. And so I did - and came to own the two large golden lions that apparently guarded the fireplace at his penthouse flat at the top of the Mirror building. </p> <p>And United? Well, I will always be remembered as the clown who ran on the pitch bouncing the ball on my head and scoring my hat-trick of goals into the Stretford End net. I have to live with that. But I'll say this... that club has never looked back since I ran on to the pitch bouncing that ball on my head.</p>",

The quicker they make the Conference an official Fourth Division, the better. And the quicker they say to the Premier League, can we have another \u00a320 million, because we shall need that now to make it the official Fourth Division, the better. You are saying your spell as 'team manager' in 1998-99 was press invention? After Mervyn Day, I wanted Peter Beardsley to be our new manager but he was under contract at the time. It was decided to appoint our coaches as joint managers but they wanted a 'front' - they were not happy with that side of the job. I had been a PE teacher, I'd been interested in sports science all my life and I'm an ex-professional player. So I said: 'I'll do the press - I'll take the responsibility if it all goes wrong.' But I didn't put on one coaching session and I never gave one team talk. The press were told that. But it suited their agenda for me to be interfering... just a meddling, overweight chairman playing out his Roy-of-the-Rovers fantasy. But promising the Premiership in seven years? I would rather reach for the stars and hit the moon - and we hit the moon. That club had been going for the best part of a century and never dreamed of Wembley's twin towers. We went twice in five years - and won it [Auto Windscreens Trophy] once. Carlisle had won one silver pot in its history before I arrived and we won two pots in five years [that trophy and the Third Division title]. I don't regret anything. It's a dream business. What do you think now about your time as a director of Manchester United - and your attempt to buy the club? I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a director. My views, my blueprint, were regarded as far too optimistic by some at the time. In fact, they've gone on and outstripped even what I thought was possible. And \u00a310 million for United doesn't look a bad deal now, does it? Of course people said I didn't have the money. Well I did have it, always had and the Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed I had it - and so did Martin Edwards. Robert Maxwell, who wanted to buy United, gave me a going over in the Daily Mirror but I could not believe it when I heard about his death. Then you start to appreciate what was happening at the time. I firmly believe Maxwell intended to pay back the pension fund. You see the scenario, his gearing was sky-high in the middle of a recession with a Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, saying, 'There is no recession', and the reality was that banks were calling in overdrafts. He probably intended to pay back the pension fund having used the money to buy his own company shares and increase the value of his firms. He ran out of time. They were ready to knock on his door before he could do it... so he jumped. I made it my business to find out about the auction of Maxwell memorabilia after his death. I decided, whatever Lot No 1 was at the auction I'd buy it. And so I did - and came to own the two large golden lions that apparently guarded the fireplace at his penthouse flat at the top of the Mirror building. And United? Well, I will always be remembered as the clown who ran on the pitch bouncing the ball on my head and scoring my hat-trick of goals into the Stretford End net. I have to live with that. But I'll say this... that club has never looked back since I ran on to the pitch bouncing that ball on my head.",

      "body": "<p><strong> 1 Lille </strong><br> <strong> Brasserie de la Paix</strong><br> In the heart of a lively city given over to good eating, this ornate Thirties brasserie has an oyster-counter outside its door, and is a good place to enjoy that ubiquitous local dish: a vast platter of<strong> moules marini\u00e8res</strong> with a pile of crisp golden chips. In this traffic-free zone near the Vieille Bourse, some restaurants are open all night, and compete to see which can build up the highest mound of empty shells on the pavement. Also ask for <strong> gratin de petits coquillages au muscadet</strong>. <br> 25 place Rihour, Tel 00 33 3 20 54 70 41. Set meals Fr95-150 (\u00a39.50-\u00a315). </p> <p> <strong> 2 Strasbourg </strong><br> <strong> Maison Kammerzell</strong><br> In the main square facing the cathedral, this handsome half-timbered Renaissance building houses a large, well-known and very picturesque restaurant. Besieged by locals as well as tourists, it is ideal for savouring Alsatian atmosphere and cui sine, and has several small rooms furnished with antiques. Portions are vast. Ask for <strong> choucroute aux poissons</strong>, invented here; <strong> foie gras </strong> and<strong> iced kugelhopf</strong>, an Alsatian cake, with cherry jam. <br> 19 place de la Cath\u00e9drale, 00 33 3 88 32 42 14. Fr180-295 (\u00a318-\u00a330). </p> <p> <strong> 3 Rouffach, Alsace </strong><br> <strong> Auberge du Vieux Pressoir</strong> <br>This old wine-press house, beguilingly bucolic, stands outside a village south of Colmar. Here I joined greedy local trenchermen to enjoy a giant mound of <strong> choucroute</strong>, Alsatians' favourite dish - pickled cabbage with every kind of pork by-product, soused in Sylvaner. Then came warm grilled <strong> M\u00fcnster</strong>, the splendidly smelly cheese of the Vosges and a local <strong> bilberry tart</strong>. Also ask for <strong> frogs' legs saut\u00e9ed in herbs and garlic.</strong> <br> Bollenburg, 00 33 3 89 49 60 04. Set meals from Fr95 (\u00a39.50). </p> <p> <strong> 4 Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or </strong> <br><strong> Paul Bocuse</strong><br> The standard-bearer of the nouvelle cuisine revolution of the Seventies is now 74 but he remains one of France's great chefs, and his luxurious restaurant with its flamboyant decor just north of Lyon is wonderful (Michelin ***). On one wall hangs a huge portrait of 'the Emperor' himself (as he's known). He is a Rabelaisian figure, tall and burly, warm and funny, making outrageously conceited remarks with a merry twinkle. He served me his amazing truffle soup created for President Giscard d'Estaing. Also ask for <strong> sea bass with seaweed;</strong> <strong> sweetbreads with crayfish</strong>. <br> Beside Sane, 12km N of Lyon, 00 33 4 72 42 90 90. Set meals Fr480-780 (\u00a348-\u00a378). </p> <p> <strong> 5 Chonas-l'Amballan </strong><br> <strong> Domaine de Clairefontaine</strong><br> An eighteenth-century country mansion in the Rhne valley, once the home of bishops, now a sympathetic little hotel, idyllically rural, owned and run by the friendly Girardon family. Son Philippe wins a Michelin star for his inventive modern cuisine, served by bow-tied waiters in an elegant room with grey-and-yellow decor. Superb Cte-du-Rhne wines. Ask for: <strong> soup of frogs and mushrooms</strong>; <strong> sea bream with crote of herbs</strong>; <strong> salad of white truffles with roast quail</strong>. <br> 9 km S of Vienne, 00 33 4 74 58 81 52. Set meals Fr180-450 (\u00a318-\u00a345). </p> <p> <strong> 6 Peillon, inland from Nice </strong><br> <strong> Auberge de la Madone</strong><br> Only 20km from hectic Nice, but in spirit a world away, this delightful auberge stands high in the hills up a giddy winding road, beside an ancient hill-village perched on a rocky spur. The exuberant owners, the Millo family, offer genuine cuisine ni\u00e7oise in their restaurant, called L'Authentique. Here we dined on a broad flowery terrace, with a sublime view of the valley. A happy family ambience, abetted by the multi-waistcoated waiter, Roger. Madame claims that 'almost every dish is an aphrodisiac'. Ask for <strong> quail with grapes</strong>; <strong> dorade grilled with wild fennel</strong>; <strong> hot fruit tarts</strong>. <br>19 km NE of Nice, 00 33 4 93 79 99 36. Fr230-320 (\u00a323-\u00a345), wine included. </p> <p> <strong> 7La Cadi\u00e8re d'Azur </strong><br> <strong> Hostellerie B\u00e9rard</strong><br> One of my favourites in Provence. In an unspoilt hill-village, an old inn south-east of Marseille has been converted into a stylish modern auberge, run with skill and charm by owners Ren\u00e9 and Dani\u00e8le B\u00e9rard. She is the exuberant and flirtatious front-of-house, bossy with her staff, friendly with guests. His excellent cooking, much admired, comprises some classic Proven\u00e7al dishes, others more nouvelle such as the delicious <strong> fricass\u00e9e of kid's offal with asparagus</strong>. Beamed ceilings, tiled floors, panoramic views. Also ask for <strong> crayfish with ravioli of cod</strong>; <strong> beef with foie gras in truffle juice</strong>. <br>9 km N of Bandol, 00 33 4 94 90 01 94. Set meals Fr160-295 (\u00a316-\u00a330). </p> <p> <strong> 8 St-Jean-du-Bruel</strong><br> <strong>H\u00f4tel du Midi-Papillon</strong> <br>The very best of traditional rural France: owned and run for four generations by the delightful Papillon family, this former relais de poste stands by a medieval bridge in a small village. Though now quite smart, it still offers amazing value for money, and is much loved. Madame Butterfly is gracious and energetic, her husband does old-style country cooking, rich and succulent. Fruit and vegetables are from the garden, charcuterie is home-made. Ask for <strong> confit de canard</strong>, <strong> civet de chevreuil</strong>, <strong> cassoulet</strong>, <strong> boeuf en daube</strong>, all often on the en pension menu.<br> 40 km SE of Millau, tel 00 33 5 65 62 26 04. Set meals Fr77-214 (\u00a38-\u00a322). </p> <p> <strong> 9 Salles-Curan, Aveyron </strong><br> <strong> Hostellerie du L\u00e9v\u00e9zou</strong><br> Near a hilltop village in the rolling Massif Central, this ivy-covered fourteenth-century castle, former residence of the bishops of Rodez, is now a hostelry owned and run by the ebullient Bouviala family. In the packed dining room, with its barrel-vaulted ceiling and baronial decor, I found a wonderfully exuberant atmosphere. The robust cooking is superb too: <strong> beef</strong> arrives seared black outside, almost raw inside. In summer you can dine out under the vines. Ask for <strong> m\u00e9li m\u00e9lo de la mer</strong> (mixed seafood). <br> 40 km SE of Rodez, 00 33 5 65 46 34 16. Set meals Fr90-260 (\u00a39-\u00a326). </p> <p> <strong> 10 Toulouse </strong><br> <strong> Les Jardina de l'Op\u00e9ra</strong><br> In the ancient heart of this rose-pink city stands the sumptuous Grand Htel de l'Op\u00e9ra, a converted seventeenth-century convent. Its fashionable gourmet restaurant, the best in town, is separately owned by its brilliant chef, Dominique Toulousy, local boy made very good. His variations on Languedoc dishes are gracefully served in a large patio with a pond and Greco-Roman statues. Ask for the rich <strong> cassoulet</strong>, <strong> ravioli of foie gras with truffle juice</strong>. <br> 1 place du Capitole, 00 33 5 61 23 07 76. Set meals Fr230-560 (\u00a323-\u00a356). </p> <p> <strong> 11 La Rochelle </strong><br> <strong> Bar Andr\u00e9</strong><br> On the harbourside of my favourite French coastal town, facing its twin medieval forts, this big brasserie with its marine decor is a lively local meeting place. Its euphoric owner plied us with local dishes <strong> - cagouilles charentaises</strong> (snails in a potent wine sauce) and <strong> mouclade</strong> (mussels in curry). Both were delicious, as was the local red wine, Mareuil. We sat on the sunny terrace, watching a horde of Brits on a veteran car rally: one man in a 1936 Austin was dressed as Toad of Toad Hall, in green galoshes ( ils sont fous ces anglais ). Also ask for <strong> matelote d'anguilles \u00e0 l'ancienne</strong> (eel stew). <br> Place Chane, 00 33 5 46 41 28 24. Set meal Fr156 (\u00a316). </p> <p> <strong> 12 St-Vaast-la-Hougue </strong><br> <strong> Les Fuchsias</strong><br> Brits come in plenty to this little oyster-breeding port near Cherbourg, to stay at the pleasant Htel de France or to eat in its pretty restaurant, festooned indeed with red fuchsias. You can dine in a lovely walled garden with a banana tree, or in an elegant conservatory with green awnings. Polished service by young men in white jackets, excellent Norman food, fresh local <strong> fish </strong> and<strong> oysters</strong>. Ask for <strong> soup of langoustine tails</strong>, <strong> duck cooked with lavender honey</strong>. <br> 29 km SE of Cherbourg. Set meals Fr125-300 (\u00a313-\u00a330). </p> <p> <strong> 13 Paris, \u00c9toile, 17th arr </strong> <br><strong> Guy Savoy</strong><br> The ebullient patron/chef of this smart classic restaurant down a side street is today a media star and propagandist of cuisine: he has created a chain of little bistros across Paris, and he lectures on food to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. Well spaced tables, soign\u00e9 service, African art on the walls, superb cooking (Michelin **). Ask for <strong> artichoke soup with truffles</strong>, <strong> calves' trotters</strong>, <strong> warm chocolate tart</strong>. <br> 18 rue Troyon, 00 33 1 43 80 40 61. Prices Fr620-950 (\u00a362-\u00a395). </p> <p> <strong> 14 Paris, La Bastille, 4th arr </strong><br> <strong> Brasserie Bofinger</strong> <br>The oldest brasserie in Paris (and perhaps still the best) was founded in 1864 by an Alsatian. Its lavish art nouveau decor, with a lovely glass cupola, was added later, and is still there. It is now a classified monument historique . Great names from politics, letters and the media come to dine, but prices are moderate. Swift and polished service, lively Parisian chatter, and remarkable <strong> oysters, choucroute, pastries </strong> and <strong> beers</strong>. Also ask for the giant <strong> seafood platter; pigs' trotters</strong> and the '<strong> Paris-Brest' dessert</strong>. <br> 5-7 rue de la Bastille. Set menus: Fr120-190 (\u00a312-\u00a319). </p> <p> <strong> 15 Paris, St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s</strong><br><strong> Orestias</strong><br> Perhaps my favourite cheap eatery in Paris. In a narrow street full of small restaurants, it is Greek-owned and down-to-earth, with swift service by friendly Greek waiters. You sit at long shared tables, chatting to your neighbours, usually a cross-section of minor Left Bank intelligentsia and offbeat tourists. Classic Greek and some French dishes, lavish, decently cooked. Good retsina. <br> rue Gr\u00e9goire-de-Tours,00 33 1 43 54 62 01 Prices: Fr70-100 (\u00a37-\u00a310). </p> <p>\u0095 John Ardagh is author of 'France in the New Century' (Viking Penguin, 2000).</p>",

Set meals Fr95-150 (\u00a39.50-\u00a315). 2 Strasbourg Maison Kammerzell In the main square facing the cathedral, this handsome half-timbered Renaissance building houses a large, well-known and very picturesque restaurant. Besieged by locals as well as tourists, it is ideal for savouring Alsatian atmosphere and cui sine, and has several small rooms furnished with antiques. Portions are vast. Ask for choucroute aux poissons, invented here; foie gras and iced kugelhopf, an Alsatian cake, with cherry jam. 19 place de la Cath\u00e9drale, 00 33 3 88 32 42 14. Fr180-295 (\u00a318-\u00a330). 3 Rouffach, Alsace Auberge du Vieux Pressoir This old wine-press house, beguilingly bucolic, stands outside a village south of Colmar. Here I joined greedy local trenchermen to enjoy a giant mound of choucroute, Alsatians' favourite dish - pickled cabbage with every kind of pork by-product, soused in Sylvaner. Then came warm grilled M\u00fcnster, the splendidly smelly cheese of the Vosges and a local bilberry tart. Also ask for frogs' legs saut\u00e9ed in herbs and garlic. Bollenburg, 00 33 3 89 49 60 04. Set meals from Fr95 (\u00a39.50). 4 Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or Paul Bocuse The standard-bearer of the nouvelle cuisine revolution of the Seventies is now 74 but he remains one of France's great chefs, and his luxurious restaurant with its flamboyant decor just north of Lyon is wonderful (Michelin ***). On one wall hangs a huge portrait of 'the Emperor' himself (as he's known). He is a Rabelaisian figure, tall and burly, warm and funny, making outrageously conceited remarks with a merry twinkle. He served me his amazing truffle soup created for President Giscard d'Estaing. Also ask for sea bass with seaweed; sweetbreads with crayfish. Beside Sane, 12km N of Lyon, 00 33 4 72 42 90 90. Set meals Fr480-780 (\u00a348-\u00a378). 5 Chonas-l'Amballan Domaine de Clairefontaine An eighteenth-century country mansion in the Rhne valley, once the home of bishops, now a sympathetic little hotel, idyllically rural, owned and run by the friendly Girardon family. Son Philippe wins a Michelin star for his inventive modern cuisine, served by bow-tied waiters in an elegant room with grey-and-yellow decor. Superb Cte-du-Rhne wines. Ask for: soup of frogs and mushrooms; sea bream with crote of herbs; salad of white truffles with roast quail. 9 km S of Vienne, 00 33 4 74 58 81 52. Set meals Fr180-450 (\u00a318-\u00a345). 6 Peillon, inland from Nice Auberge de la Madone Only 20km from hectic Nice, but in spirit a world away, this delightful auberge stands high in the hills up a giddy winding road, beside an ancient hill-village perched on a rocky spur. The exuberant owners, the Millo family, offer genuine cuisine ni\u00e7oise in their restaurant, called L'Authentique. Here we dined on a broad flowery terrace, with a sublime view of the valley. A happy family ambience, abetted by the multi-waistcoated waiter, Roger. Madame claims that 'almost every dish is an aphrodisiac'. Ask for quail with grapes; dorade grilled with wild fennel; hot fruit tarts. 19 km NE of Nice, 00 33 4 93 79 99 36. Fr230-320 (\u00a323-\u00a345), wine included. 7La Cadi\u00e8re d'Azur Hostellerie B\u00e9rard One of my favourites in Provence. In an unspoilt hill-village, an old inn south-east of Marseille has been converted into a stylish modern auberge, run with skill and charm by owners Ren\u00e9 and Dani\u00e8le B\u00e9rard. She is the exuberant and flirtatious front-of-house, bossy with her staff, friendly with guests. His excellent cooking, much admired, comprises some classic Proven\u00e7al dishes, others more nouvelle such as the delicious fricass\u00e9e of kid's offal with asparagus. Beamed ceilings, tiled floors, panoramic views. Also ask for crayfish with ravioli of cod; beef with foie gras in truffle juice. 9 km N of Bandol, 00 33 4 94 90 01 94. Set meals Fr160-295 (\u00a316-\u00a330). 8 St-Jean-du-Bruel H\u00f4tel du Midi-Papillon The very best of traditional rural France: owned and run for four generations by the delightful Papillon family, this former relais de poste stands by a medieval bridge in a small village. Though now quite smart, it still offers amazing value for money, and is much loved. Madame Butterfly is gracious and energetic, her husband does old-style country cooking, rich and succulent. Fruit and vegetables are from the garden, charcuterie is home-made. Ask for confit de canard, civet de chevreuil, cassoulet, boeuf en daube, all often on the en pension menu. 40 km SE of Millau, tel 00 33 5 65 62 26 04. Set meals Fr77-214 (\u00a38-\u00a322). 9 Salles-Curan, Aveyron Hostellerie du L\u00e9v\u00e9zou Near a hilltop village in the rolling Massif Central, this ivy-covered fourteenth-century castle, former residence of the bishops of Rodez, is now a hostelry owned and run by the ebullient Bouviala family. In the packed dining room, with its barrel-vaulted ceiling and baronial decor, I found a wonderfully exuberant atmosphere. The robust cooking is superb too: beef arrives seared black outside, almost raw inside. In summer you can dine out under the vines. Ask for m\u00e9li m\u00e9lo de la mer (mixed seafood). 40 km SE of Rodez, 00 33 5 65 46 34 16. Set meals Fr90-260 (\u00a39-\u00a326). 10 Toulouse Les Jardina de l'Op\u00e9ra In the ancient heart of this rose-pink city stands the sumptuous Grand Htel de l'Op\u00e9ra, a converted seventeenth-century convent. Its fashionable gourmet restaurant, the best in town, is separately owned by its brilliant chef, Dominique Toulousy, local boy made very good. His variations on Languedoc dishes are gracefully served in a large patio with a pond and Greco-Roman statues. Ask for the rich cassoulet, ravioli of foie gras with truffle juice. 1 place du Capitole, 00 33 5 61 23 07 76. Set meals Fr230-560 (\u00a323-\u00a356). 11 La Rochelle Bar Andr\u00e9 On the harbourside of my favourite French coastal town, facing its twin medieval forts, this big brasserie with its marine decor is a lively local meeting place. Its euphoric owner plied us with local dishes - cagouilles charentaises (snails in a potent wine sauce) and mouclade (mussels in curry). Both were delicious, as was the local red wine, Mareuil. We sat on the sunny terrace, watching a horde of Brits on a veteran car rally: one man in a 1936 Austin was dressed as Toad of Toad Hall, in green galoshes ( ils sont fous ces anglais ). Also ask for matelote d'anguilles \u00e0 l'ancienne (eel stew). Place Chane, 00 33 5 46 41 28 24. Set meal Fr156 (\u00a316). 12 St-Vaast-la-Hougue Les Fuchsias Brits come in plenty to this little oyster-breeding port near Cherbourg, to stay at the pleasant Htel de France or to eat in its pretty restaurant, festooned indeed with red fuchsias. You can dine in a lovely walled garden with a banana tree, or in an elegant conservatory with green awnings. Polished service by young men in white jackets, excellent Norman food, fresh local fish and oysters. Ask for soup of langoustine tails, duck cooked with lavender honey. 29 km SE of Cherbourg. Set meals Fr125-300 (\u00a313-\u00a330). 13 Paris, \u00c9toile, 17th arr Guy Savoy The ebullient patron/chef of this smart classic restaurant down a side street is today a media star and propagandist of cuisine: he has created a chain of little bistros across Paris, and he lectures on food to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. Well spaced tables, soign\u00e9 service, African art on the walls, superb cooking (Michelin **). Ask for artichoke soup with truffles, calves' trotters, warm chocolate tart. 18 rue Troyon, 00 33 1 43 80 40 61. Prices Fr620-950 (\u00a362-\u00a395). 14 Paris, La Bastille, 4th arr Brasserie Bofinger The oldest brasserie in Paris (and perhaps still the best) was founded in 1864 by an Alsatian. Its lavish art nouveau decor, with a lovely glass cupola, was added later, and is still there. It is now a classified monument historique . Great names from politics, letters and the media come to dine, but prices are moderate. Swift and polished service, lively Parisian chatter, and remarkable oysters, choucroute, pastries and beers. Also ask for the giant seafood platter; pigs' trotters and the ' Paris-Brest' dessert. 5-7 rue de la Bastille. Set menus: Fr120-190 (\u00a312-\u00a319). 15 Paris, St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s Orestias Perhaps my favourite cheap eatery in Paris. In a narrow street full of small restaurants, it is Greek-owned and down-to-earth, with swift service by friendly Greek waiters. You sit at long shared tables, chatting to your neighbours, usually a cross-section of minor Left Bank intelligentsia and offbeat tourists. Classic Greek and some French dishes, lavish, decently cooked. Good retsina. rue Gr\u00e9goire-de-Tours,00 33 1 43 54 62 01 Prices: Fr70-100 (\u00a37-\u00a310). \u0095 John Ardagh is author of 'France in the New Century' (Viking Penguin, 2000).",

      "body": "<p>Because most of the great French ski resorts were purpose-built high in the Alps, they lack the traditional village bars or the comfortable schnapps huts that make Austrian ski runs such fun. But if you know where to look, there are some fine mountain restaurants for high-priced, haute cuisine while some of the bars, thanks usually to enthusiastic British drinkers, are busy, loud and noisy. </p> <p><strong> Mont Blanc area </strong></p> <p> <strong> Megeve </strong><br> La Raviere, a little off-piste restaurant just after you ski over from the Megeve slopes into the St Gervais sector, is the 'in' place just now. Run by Madame Aline Guemi from Alsace it not surprisingly serves food with an Alsatian flavour. Sausage salads, pt\u00e9, rosti, air-dried ham, onion and cheese tart are what you find on the fixed-price menu which costs Fr200. Only six tables inside and three outside. Les Mandarines is my favourite among the large number of excellent mountain eateries, none of them inexpensive. Even years ago it was prepared to accept credit cards, then not generally welcome in France, as my children discovered to their delight and my cost. Large balcony for comfortable eating. </p> <p> <strong> Chamonix </strong><br> The Panoramic at the top of Brevent cable car has stunning views though the food can be less stunning. Les Choucas, Chambre Neuf and Irish Coffee are popular for drinks once the lifts stop running. </p> <p> <strong> Argentiere </strong><br> Plan Joran at Grands Montets has fine food. Go in the waiter-service part and you won't regret the extra cost. The Office Bar is the English apr\u00e8s-ski favourite. </p> <p><strong> La Clusaz </strong><br> Bercail, halfway up L'Aiguille, is a wonderful mountain restaurant, that specialises in seafood. You can get up there by night on snowmobiles and sled down afterwards if that's your swim. </p> <p><strong> Espace Killy </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Val d'Is\u00e8e, Tignes </strong><br> These resorts are more a skier's than a gourmet's delight. Upstairs at Toviere on the boundary between the two sectors is fun and slightly less hectic than the serve-yourself downstairs. Panoramic at the top of the Grand Motte funicular does good grills in its waiter-service part. Le Ski d'Or in dreary Tignes has many fans for its excellent fish. Bouida and La Sachette down in the old village of Brevieres, beneath the great hydroelectric dam, are two of a good choice of restaurants, all busy at lunchtime. </p> <p> La Fruitiere, at the top of the gondola up from La Daille, is a place to eat well. Its owner bought and transported the trappings of a Savoyard dairy up the mountain. Now you lunch in an all-white French Express Dairy with excellent food. It is famous for its five-tier cheese selection. In an area notorious for poor toilet facilities, this is the place for a good free wash and brush-up. Those eating in the cheaper self-service part have to pay Fr2 for toilet privileges. Le Triffolet further down the home run is good for pizzas. Crech d'Ouna, at La Daille, is an old farmhouse, which has great regional food for days when the weather closes in. </p> <p> L'Arolay in Le Fornet, at the other end of this vast area, has excellent regional food. It is about 100m down the road from the cable car station. La Grande Ourse in Val itself is the place to be on a sunny day, if you want to eat outside, though like many of the better French alpine eating spots service service can be slow despite high prices. Dick's Tea Bar, set up 21 years ago by an Englishman, but sold on now to a group that has opened a clone in M\u00e9ribel, is still for some the place for apr\u00e8s-ski into the small hours.

It has two bars, one on the ground floor and the other downstairs, and both of them are usually heaving from 5pm onwards.

Can often be heaving with Brits. There's a vast sunny terrace for good days, but getting a table inside or out can be difficult. For all that, it is worth braving a blizzard toenjoy the food. The Bubble Bar in 1650, another hot spot for Brits, though ones with shallower pockets, is an internet caf\u00e9-bar set up this season by the British operator Le Ski. </p> <p> Bistro Le Praz well down the mountain at 1300, is the place to eat on poor-light days. Famous for its foie gras and high prices, it has just changed hands. </p> <p> Soucoupe has good food and manageable prices on both self- and waiter-service floors and is a friendly place. Chalet du Cret, an old converted barn, serves interesting food with a fixed menu. </p> <p> <strong> Meribel</strong><br> Les Choucas just below the Saulire gondola's middle station has a good prix fixe lunch. Tougnete, up on the ridge that divides the central from the third valley is a modest mountain restaurant. It is a good place for a Kir Royale, before skiing on down. Meribel, founded by an English colonel just before World War II, is still terribly British. Bar Rhododendron by the piste down from the Altiport is popular for the first apr\u00e8s-ski drinks. </p> <p><strong> Les Menuires </strong><br> Caf\u00e9 2000 in this much-derided resort has surprisingly great food. Its speciality is a plate of huge grilled gambas, on a bed of Proven\u00e7al thyme, served with flaming brandy. </p> <p> <strong> Elsewhere </strong> </p> <p><strong> La Plagne </strong><br> La Bergerie above Plagne Bellecote offers pleasant, if slightly pricey meals. Le Matafan in Belle Plagne offers a dozen different mountain lunch plates for about Fr70 each and gets very busy.

      "body": "<p>French resorts are becoming busier as the school ski holidays get under way. Italy still tops the list for European snow, while across the Atlantic Rocky Mountain storms brought welcome new dumps. </p> <p><strong>Andorra</strong> <br>Rough, cold weather closed some resorts during the week. Soldeu/ El Tarter (80cm on lower slopes and 120cm higher up) had managed to keep three-quarters of runs open. </p> <p><strong>Austria</strong><br> St Anton (40/170cm) has been busy with the World Alpine Ski Championships. Despite the off-piste powder being 'shallow' there was considerable avalanche risk. At Mayrhofen (5/114cm) the pistes are in good shape while off-piste is 'firm'. Soll (20/85cm) was 'much better after fresh snow', with good pistes and powder off-piste but home runs were still a bit icy. Kitzb\u00fchel (10/50cm) was describing conditions on and off-piste as 'perfect'. </p> <p><strong>Bulgaria</strong><br> Borovets (20/35cm) is worse off than Pamporovo (30/40cm). Both resorts had got all lifts working but conditions were better on the higher slopes. Poiana Brasov in ROMANIA (30/5cm) had more depth down low because it had been able to use the snow guns on the nursery slopes. </p> <p><strong>Canada</strong><br> Things are all right but not brilliant. Whistler (165/235cm) had more snow and was not so cold. Lake Louise (50/70cm) was completely open, cold and cloudy and had lost some base. Tremblant (30/70cm), the leading resort in the east, is doing much better than last year and with all its firm-packed runs open, was rather cold and expecting more snow flurries. </p> <p> <strong>France</strong><br> Sunny, cold conditions midweek were expected to last. Above 1,500m new snow had improved things generally, and there was good skiing in most areas. Serre Chevalier (50/310cm) had packed pistes. In Les Arcs (65/240cm), Flaine (55/270cm), and M\u00e9ribel (45/95cm) surfaces were 'powdery'. Courchevel (25/90cm) had powder on packed pistes. Val d'Is\u00e8re/ Tignes (65/230cm) was also powdery. Meg\u00e8ve (20/100cm) pistes were firm packed. Chamonix (55/230cm) was cloudy. </p> <p><strong>Italy</strong><br> Madesimo (150/530cm) and Livigno (135/325cm) top the world table of snow depths. This must be Italy's year, with scope for late bookers. Cold weather was helping preserve the snow though pistes were becoming hard packed. Courmayeur (100/300cm) has been enjoying sunny days but was becoming unsettled. Cervinia (90/300cm) was sunny and good, as was Passo Tonale (150/180cm). Cortina (30/250cm) was cloudy with a smidgeon of fresh snow. On the Milky Way, Sestriere (80/140cm) reflected the good conditions throughout, as did Arabba (80/195cm) on the Sella Ronda. </p> <p> <strong>Norway</strong><br> Comes into its own as the days lengthen, but at the moment is still quite cold.

      "bodyText": "French resorts are becoming busier as the school ski holidays get under way. Italy still tops the list for European snow, while across the Atlantic Rocky Mountain storms brought welcome new dumps. Andorra Rough, cold weather closed some resorts during the week. Soldeu/ El Tarter (80cm on lower slopes and 120cm higher up) had managed to keep three-quarters of runs open. Austria St Anton (40/170cm) has been busy with the World Alpine Ski Championships. Despite the off-piste powder being 'shallow' there was considerable avalanche risk. At Mayrhofen (5/114cm) the pistes are in good shape while off-piste is 'firm'. Soll (20/85cm) was 'much better after fresh snow', with good pistes and powder off-piste but home runs were still a bit icy. Kitzb\u00fchel (10/50cm) was describing conditions on and off-piste as 'perfect'. Bulgaria Borovets (20/35cm) is worse off than Pamporovo (30/40cm). Both resorts had got all lifts working but conditions were better on the higher slopes. Poiana Brasov in ROMANIA (30/5cm) had more depth down low because it had been able to use the snow guns on the nursery slopes. Canada Things are all right but not brilliant. Whistler (165/235cm) had more snow and was not so cold. Lake Louise (50/70cm) was completely open, cold and cloudy and had lost some base. Tremblant (30/70cm), the leading resort in the east, is doing much better than last year and with all its firm-packed runs open, was rather cold and expecting more snow flurries. France Sunny, cold conditions midweek were expected to last. Above 1,500m new snow had improved things generally, and there was good skiing in most areas. Serre Chevalier (50/310cm) had packed pistes. In Les Arcs (65/240cm), Flaine (55/270cm), and M\u00e9ribel (45/95cm) surfaces were 'powdery'. Courchevel (25/90cm) had powder on packed pistes. Val d'Is\u00e8re/ Tignes (65/230cm) was also powdery. Meg\u00e8ve (20/100cm) pistes were firm packed. Chamonix (55/230cm) was cloudy. Italy Madesimo (150/530cm) and Livigno (135/325cm) top the world table of snow depths. This must be Italy's year, with scope for late bookers. Cold weather was helping preserve the snow though pistes were becoming hard packed. Courmayeur (100/300cm) has been enjoying sunny days but was becoming unsettled. Cervinia (90/300cm) was sunny and good, as was Passo Tonale (150/180cm). Cortina (30/250cm) was cloudy with a smidgeon of fresh snow. On the Milky Way, Sestriere (80/140cm) reflected the good conditions throughout, as did Arabba (80/195cm) on the Sella Ronda. Norway Comes into its own as the days lengthen, but at the moment is still quite cold. Hemsedal (120/190cm) is doing well, also Geilo (125/140cm) but Voss (30/40cm) hadn't got much open midweek. Slovenia Yet to get into its stride. Skiing is best at Kransjka Gora (25/50cm). Switzerland Most resorts have been sunny and cold but would welcome more snow.

      "body": "<p>The larger size of family, being somewhat irregular, is not readily catered for by the holiday industry. This is especially so if such families yearn for something more adventurous than a grimy August fortnight in a bashed-up British holiday camp with the same old menu of bashed-up British grub. Despite my personal weakness for scenes of native pathos, mine is such a family and a pretty variegated one at that: a septet that includes five children ranging from an as-good-as-grown-up girl of 16 to a cuddly boy toddler of two, with a brace of bouncy brothers and a dizzy little sister in between. Finding a summer break to meet their needs, and provide some rest for two parents, is no straightforward task. And yet we did it; moreover, we did it with what by our standards might even qualify as a touch of style. </p> <p>The key to our success was a mobile home, a form of accommodation representing the best available compromise between our unfeasible fantasies of extreme luxury and brutal financial realities. The mobile - or 'the hotel' as we fondly misdescribed it to the younger ones - was located on a camp site at Bretignolles sur Mer, a little coastal settlement on the edge of the Vend\u00e9e, a largely rural region that lies half way down the western side of France. </p> <p>The Vend\u00e9e proved to be exactly the right kind of destination: neither too hot nor too cold, too difficult nor too easy; not so alien as to make large-scale childcare even more exacting than usual, yet far enough away from home geographically and culturally to feel properly foreign. There was sea, sand and swimming pools and there were lizards, curious toilets and food that was different but still acceptable to conservative young tastes. Oh yes, and there were mussels: mussels everywhere. </p> <p>Our campsite - La Trevilliere - was relatively posh, meaning you could buy fresh bread and pastries in the morning and pizzas in the evening if you were too lazy to cook. It also meant you could hire bikes, and these provided the vacation with one of its central images, that of my sons of nine and 11 whizzing down the driveways between the tents and caravans with their infant siblings clinging to their backs in blissful terror. </p> <p>The mobile home itself offered all we could have asked for: enough beds for everyone and only one of them too short for its incumbent; our own toilet and shower; a nifty little kitchen where papa could demonstrate his culinary crudity; ingenious storage spaces which entertained the children; and a spacious living area. We luxuriated condescendingly in the linguistic curiosities of the English version of the local guide book ('Here the know to welcome has been preciously acquired') before piling into the Previa and hunting for a restaurant which could cater for a vegetarian who doesn't eat vegetables and a five year-old who would be content never to eat at all. </p> <p>On the last leg of our journey to Bretignolles we had passed through St Gilles, a holiday town with a funfair, a market and a harbour lined with bars and restaurants. We soon found locations for al fresco dining gamely catering to every awkward taste in our party, and entertaining us with novel presentations of the local seafood. Mounds of salty molluscs and menacing crustaceans were piled high on plastic galleons and schooners, and there was no getting away from those mussels. You couldn't move for moules served up one way or another, usually with frites. The average size portion seemed to be an iron bucketful. </p> <p>We tried to go out every day but limited our ambitions: the kids had spent enough time on the road. Often we simply messed around on Bretignolle beach, spread out on St Gilles's broader band of sand or just stayed on the site playing ping-pong and crazy golf, or thrashing around in the pool. There was also bar entertainment after dark. One of my sons and I returned home toting a big, kitsch trophy for winning a pool competition, the real beauty of our triumph being the humbling of two thoroughly revolting boys from Leeds. </p> <p>Our bolder excursions were successful, although in varying ways. There was a lazy boat cruise around the Venice Verts, a network of inland waterways in the lovely countryside of Marais Poiterin: a little leisurely for some tastes, but a little bit of suffering doesn't hurt them. The Velo Rail at Commecquiers required rather more exertion. It's an old railway line, starting at a restored station, along which parties of four ride curious contraptions best described as bicycles welded together with a seat in between. We pedalled, we picnicked, we pedalled back again: a totally absurd way to pass the time of day and none the worse for that. </p> <p>The one misadventure was our attempt to reach Sauveterre beach, which sounded from the guide book like a short walk from the roadside through a pine wood and turned out to be a major hike across sand, complete with rickety pushchair dragged backwards. Still, we did collect a bag of massive fir cones en route which months later, sprayed with silver paint, made splendid Christmas decorations. It's often the blunders you remember most vividly: those and the grazed elbows, the insects on your dinner, the arguing, the making-up, the endless arsing around. Would we do it again? Next year, I expect. </p> <p>\u0095 Dave Hill's irregular family travelled with <a href=\"http://www.camping-in-france\">Mark Hammerton Travel</a> (01892 525456) A 14-night stay in a three-bedroom mobile home at La Trevilliere costs from \u00a3600 to \u00a31,450 including return Eurotunnel crossings.</p>",

This is especially so if such families yearn for something more adventurous than a grimy August fortnight in a bashed-up British holiday camp with the same old menu of bashed-up British grub. Despite my personal weakness for scenes of native pathos, mine is such a family and a pretty variegated one at that: a septet that includes five children ranging from an as-good-as-grown-up girl of 16 to a cuddly boy toddler of two, with a brace of bouncy brothers and a dizzy little sister in between. Finding a summer break to meet their needs, and provide some rest for two parents, is no straightforward task. And yet we did it; moreover, we did it with what by our standards might even qualify as a touch of style. The key to our success was a mobile home, a form of accommodation representing the best available compromise between our unfeasible fantasies of extreme luxury and brutal financial realities. The mobile - or 'the hotel' as we fondly misdescribed it to the younger ones - was located on a camp site at Bretignolles sur Mer, a little coastal settlement on the edge of the Vend\u00e9e, a largely rural region that lies half way down the western side of France. The Vend\u00e9e proved to be exactly the right kind of destination: neither too hot nor too cold, too difficult nor too easy; not so alien as to make large-scale childcare even more exacting than usual, yet far enough away from home geographically and culturally to feel properly foreign. There was sea, sand and swimming pools and there were lizards, curious toilets and food that was different but still acceptable to conservative young tastes. Oh yes, and there were mussels: mussels everywhere. Our campsite - La Trevilliere - was relatively posh, meaning you could buy fresh bread and pastries in the morning and pizzas in the evening if you were too lazy to cook. It also meant you could hire bikes, and these provided the vacation with one of its central images, that of my sons of nine and 11 whizzing down the driveways between the tents and caravans with their infant siblings clinging to their backs in blissful terror. The mobile home itself offered all we could have asked for: enough beds for everyone and only one of them too short for its incumbent; our own toilet and shower; a nifty little kitchen where papa could demonstrate his culinary crudity; ingenious storage spaces which entertained the children; and a spacious living area. We luxuriated condescendingly in the linguistic curiosities of the English version of the local guide book ('Here the know to welcome has been preciously acquired') before piling into the Previa and hunting for a restaurant which could cater for a vegetarian who doesn't eat vegetables and a five year-old who would be content never to eat at all. On the last leg of our journey to Bretignolles we had passed through St Gilles, a holiday town with a funfair, a market and a harbour lined with bars and restaurants. We soon found locations for al fresco dining gamely catering to every awkward taste in our party, and entertaining us with novel presentations of the local seafood. Mounds of salty molluscs and menacing crustaceans were piled high on plastic galleons and schooners, and there was no getting away from those mussels. You couldn't move for moules served up one way or another, usually with frites. The average size portion seemed to be an iron bucketful. We tried to go out every day but limited our ambitions: the kids had spent enough time on the road. Often we simply messed around on Bretignolle beach, spread out on St Gilles's broader band of sand or just stayed on the site playing ping-pong and crazy golf, or thrashing around in the pool. There was also bar entertainment after dark. One of my sons and I returned home toting a big, kitsch trophy for winning a pool competition, the real beauty of our triumph being the humbling of two thoroughly revolting boys from Leeds. Our bolder excursions were successful, although in varying ways. There was a lazy boat cruise around the Venice Verts, a network of inland waterways in the lovely countryside of Marais Poiterin: a little leisurely for some tastes, but a little bit of suffering doesn't hurt them. The Velo Rail at Commecquiers required rather more exertion. It's an old railway line, starting at a restored station, along which parties of four ride curious contraptions best described as bicycles welded together with a seat in between. We pedalled, we picnicked, we pedalled back again: a totally absurd way to pass the time of day and none the worse for that. The one misadventure was our attempt to reach Sauveterre beach, which sounded from the guide book like a short walk from the roadside through a pine wood and turned out to be a major hike across sand, complete with rickety pushchair dragged backwards. Still, we did collect a bag of massive fir cones en route which months later, sprayed with silver paint, made splendid Christmas decorations. It's often the blunders you remember most vividly: those and the grazed elbows, the insects on your dinner, the arguing, the making-up, the endless arsing around. Would we do it again? Next year, I expect. \u0095 Dave Hill's irregular family travelled with Mark Hammerton Travel (01892 525456) A 14-night stay in a three-bedroom mobile home at La Trevilliere costs from \u00a3600 to \u00a31,450 including return Eurotunnel crossings.",

Anderlecht are desperate to keep the giant forward who Reid sees as the long-term replacement for Niall Quinn - Sunderland were ready to pay \u00a39m, but 'they're a long way short', says a source. HARTSON: I'M BROKEN John Hartson says the collapse of his move to Coventry - for the third time - has left him 'heartbroken'. 'I just can't believe it: I suppose I'll just have to go back to Wimbledon and see what happens.' The \u00a35m deal collapsed when insurance companies refused to provide cover. \u0095 Arsenal are set to complete a \u00a31m deal for Danish teen centre-back Per Kroldrup - Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has agreed to pay the cash in instalments. \u0095 John Gregory has told Richard Walker to leave Villa on loan - he'll hold talks with Bristol City and Luton. He also wants Ajax striker Shota Arveladze after cooling his interest in Chelsea's Mikael Forssell. \u0095 Benito Carbone could be set to stay at Bradford after the club denied agreeing a \u00a32m deal to sell him to Fulham. \u0095 Barnsley and Watford are still battling for Charlton's Carl Tiler. \u0095 Colin Hutchinson has dismissed reports of a \u00a310m Chelsea deal to land Brazilian captain Cafu, while Frank Leboeuf reckons he never wanted to join Monaco anyway: 'they're shameful'. \u0095 John Aloisi's move from Coventry to Portsmouth is back on. \u0095 Derby have failed in a bid to loan Rangers striker Billy Dodds. \u0095 Walter Smith says he can't understand Eyal Berkovic being linked with Everton: 'I don't know where the story's come from.' \u0095 Ipswich manager George Burley is ready to spend: 'The team is looking a bit jaded.' \u0095 Nigel Martyn says he'll give his Leeds understudy Paul Robinson 'a kick up the backside if he lets his head drop.' \u0095 Leicester striker Arnar Gunnlaugsson says he wants regular football: 'I am hoping for a fair crack.' \u0095 Liverpool keeper Sander Westerveld has laughed off a possible move back to Ajax. \u0095 Paolo Wanchope could move from Man City back to Derby. \u0095 Teddy Sheringham will be handed a monster-size Man United contract this week. \u0095 Middlesbrough are still keen on Aberdeen wonderkid Kevin McNaughton - the left-back is available for \u00a31m. \u0095 Wimbledon's Marcus Gayle says he'd still love to join Newcastle. \u0095 Bobby Zamora says he won't join Southampton from Brighton: 'I would be a fool to want to leave Brighton.' \u0095 Sunderland boss Peter Reid is ready to blow his \u00a31m Paul Butler cash. \u0095 Brann striker Thomas Helstad says his \u00a34m Spurs switch is on hold: 'I'm still a Brann player and that's OK.' \u0095 West Ham have missed out on Japanese cash-cow Tsuneyasu Miyamoto - he'll be back on the market in the summer.",

She quotes to herself Leon Edel on biography being 'the least exact of the sciences. So much of a man's life is lived inside his own head, that it is impossible to encompass a personality'. She decides to write a novel, because her own biographies have left her dissatisfied: 'In the end, the personalities had eluded me.' But she doesn't want to venture into 'that whorish field of biographical fiction'. </p> <p>Judith's anxiety about the limits of biography and the dangers of making it too like fiction underlie Carol Shields's first foray into biography. Her life of Jane Austen is one in the series of Weidenfeld's short, popular Lives, which match well-known writers and subjects. Edmund White on Proust, Mary Gordon on Joan of Arc, Edna O' Brien on Joyce, Nigel Nicolson on Woolf.</p> <p>Carol Shields starts hers with the difficulty of writing a life where there is so much silence around the central subject: no diary, few portraits, many letters destroyed by Jane Austen's sister, and her life rapidly 'entombed in veneration' by the family. She sees that Jane Austen presents a particularly delicate challenge (which is why biographies of her keep on being written): a rather obscure and private life, and novels which deeply absorb us, through a strong guiding voice, in the minutely registered feelings and experiences of their characters. It's hard to believe that they can't offer us clues back to the author. She makes clear straightaway her 'resistance' to the kind of biography that clothes a 'rickety skeleton' of facts with 'speculations gleaned from the novels', which assumes that 'fiction flows directly from a novelist's experience rather than from her imagination'. </p> <p>Her solution is to be tentative rather than bossy. She asks a lot of questions, and makes suggestions. Perhaps Jane Austen's mother wasn't the self-absorbed, insensitive Mrs Bennet-type figure she's always taken for, but, from the available evidence, a 'solid realist'. Perhaps Jane Austen was encouraged to write as a child by her family, 'listened to, and applauded'. Surely, long before anything was published, she 'must have known how good a writer she really was'. Perhaps she was a more 'secular being' than might be expected from the daughter and sister of clergymen. Possibly there may have been tensions between Jane Austen and her sister, 'who have commonly been regarded as being devoted to each other': 'It is hard not to see Cassandra's influence as infantilising.' </p> <p>As there, Carol Shields's reading of the life is not startlingly new, and tends to echo Claire Tomalin's rather closely. Like Tomalin, she supposes that the mother's very early weaning and fostering-out of her children may have been traumatic, that Jane Austen suffered somewhat from being treated like a dependent, a 'poor visiting sister', by her relations, and that she and Cassandra, whatever their differences may have been, 'probably took on some of the characteristics of long-settled couples' (Tomalin has: 'Sisters can become couples').</p> <p>She is particularly close to Tomalin when she gets to one of the cruxes of Jane Austen's life, the long silence that followed the family's uprooting in 1800 from Steventon to Bath. Though Carol Shields typically presents this silence as a puzzle, she settles, like Tomalin, for the interpretation that the move was a terrible upheaval, put a temporary end to the writing and led to a period of depression: 'There can be little question that Jane Austen's rather fragile frame of creativity was disturbed.' She doesn't give room to a more cynical recent version by David Nokes, derived from exactly the same lack of data, that Jane Austen was a person greedy for worldly stimulation and was having too much fun in Bath to give time to her writing. </p> <p>Carol Shields's Jane Austen is a rather wistful, touching figure, and sometimes she is a bit too eager to soften us up with the word 'heartbreaking': the 'heartbreak' of her broken youthful romance with Tom Lefroy, her 'heartbreaking' sense that she is not much in demand at balls, the 'heartbreaking' history of the posthumously published Northanger Abbey. For all her concern not to match the work to the life too simply, Carol Shields does read 'a cry from the heart' in the heroine of Northanger Abbey's having found no one to love and feeling 'a poignant sense of aloneness', or in the darkness of Persuasion, perhaps pointing to Jane Austen's own illness and 'intimations of an early death'.</p> <p>Her book is at its most absorbing when it talks about how writing works. She is very good on how Jane Austen's reading of novels shaped her treatment of 'reflective men and women facing real predicaments', or on how a coterie audience of family and friends can provide sympathetic communal encouragement, but can be no substitute for what Jane Austen lacked, a shared experience with other writers. And she is extremely alert to the complex process of the translation from life to fiction, seeing Pride and Prejudice, for instance, as 'a palimpsest, with Jane Austen's real life engraved, roughly, enigmatically, beneath its surface'. </p> <p>She begins her book by talking about the steadiness of Jane Austen's 'trenchant, knowing glance' on to the world. 'Steady' is her favourite adjective for Jane Austen: 'A steadiness of nerve prevails.' And her own reading of her heroine is - like Carol Shields's novels - steady, sensible and sympathetic.</p>",

She is particularly close to Tomalin when she gets to one of the cruxes of Jane Austen's life, the long silence that followed the family's uprooting in 1800 from Steventon to Bath. Though Carol Shields typically presents this silence as a puzzle, she settles, like Tomalin, for the interpretation that the move was a terrible upheaval, put a temporary end to the writing and led to a period of depression: 'There can be little question that Jane Austen's rather fragile frame of creativity was disturbed.' She doesn't give room to a more cynical recent version by David Nokes, derived from exactly the same lack of data, that Jane Austen was a person greedy for worldly stimulation and was having too much fun in Bath to give time to her writing. Carol Shields's Jane Austen is a rather wistful, touching figure, and sometimes she is a bit too eager to soften us up with the word 'heartbreaking': the 'heartbreak' of her broken youthful romance with Tom Lefroy, her 'heartbreaking' sense that she is not much in demand at balls, the 'heartbreaking' history of the posthumously published Northanger Abbey. For all her concern not to match the work to the life too simply, Carol Shields does read 'a cry from the heart' in the heroine of Northanger Abbey's having found no one to love and feeling 'a poignant sense of aloneness', or in the darkness of Persuasion, perhaps pointing to Jane Austen's own illness and 'intimations of an early death'. Her book is at its most absorbing when it talks about how writing works. She is very good on how Jane Austen's reading of novels shaped her treatment of 'reflective men and women facing real predicaments', or on how a coterie audience of family and friends can provide sympathetic communal encouragement, but can be no substitute for what Jane Austen lacked, a shared experience with other writers. And she is extremely alert to the complex process of the translation from life to fiction, seeing Pride and Prejudice, for instance, as 'a palimpsest, with Jane Austen's real life engraved, roughly, enigmatically, beneath its surface'. She begins her book by talking about the steadiness of Jane Austen's 'trenchant, knowing glance' on to the world. 'Steady' is her favourite adjective for Jane Austen: 'A steadiness of nerve prevails.' And her own reading of her heroine is - like Carol Shields's novels - steady, sensible and sympathetic.",

Kianjogu, Ijoji and Mweru and the most affected areas. Somer previously unaffected high-altitude areas are now alos reporting malaria. Travellers to Kenya should take steps to avoid mosquito bites especially between dusk and dawn (when the malaria transmitting mosquitoes bite). Using effective repellents on exposed skin, wearing long sleeves and trousers and sleeping under treated bed nets is also recommended. Travellers should also take a preventative malaria drug(s) for travelling to this country. Anyone experiencing high fever one week or more after arrival in Kenya should seek urgent medical attention for a blood test. Symptoms of malaria may still occur one year after returning from this area. \u0095 To obtain a health brief tailored to your journey call the MASTA Travellers Health Line on 0906 8 224 100 (calls charged at 60p/min).

      "body": "<p>There are many good things about France, but one of the very best is the ready availability of enormous jars of Dijon mustard for 19p. Almost all a tourist's basic needs, from Pernod to petrol, are cheaper over the Channel. And though French hotels have their flaws - bolster pillows, risibly inadequate breakfasts, an idiotic propensity to shut up shop during the holiday season - exorbitance isn't one of them. The Michelin Guide is a reliable and discerning authority, yet within its pages you will find appealing and comfortable hotels offering rooms for an outlay that wouldn't bag you bed and breakfast in Bridlington. </p> <p>Stay away from the big cities and the south and you can almost guarantee that the ritziest hotel in town is unlikely to cost more than 60 quid a night. Last year I stayed in the Hotel Splendide in Dax, a reinvigorated spa town just inland from Biarritz, and was astounded to learn that the price of a night in this freshly restored Deco palace, with discarded champagne buckets awaiting collection outside every other room and a tremendous lobby the size of Grand Central Station, was a shade under \u00a345. And France is the only country where I've successfully haggled with receptionists, getting a suite overlooking Strasbourg Cathedral for 30 quid less than the advertised \u00a380. </p> <p>A rock-bottom price for a room at the top - so why do I so rarely find my feet on the upper rungs of the accommodation ladder? The above examples are exceptions that prove a regrettable rule: however cheap nice hotels are in France, a life-blighting preoccupation with economy always drives me that extra kilometre to find one that is more cheap, even though it will consequently be less nice. It's partly that the goalposts move after a few days: \u00a340 for a room gradually begins to seem excessive; then \u00a330. You think: 'That's 157 jars of Dijon mustard down the pan.' </p> <p>It's partly that I am still engaged in a Proustian struggle to recapture the magic of the first accommodation bill I ever paid for out of my own pocket, back in 1981. Two nights in the Hotel Malher in Paris's fashionable Marais district - total, Fr104. And it's partly that, setting off on a trip from London to Venice in the footsteps of the first Grand Tourist, I felt a slight yet shaming spiritual affinity with the eighteenth-century author of the following peerlessly titled travelogue: A Gentleman's Guide in his Tour through France by an Officer who lately travelled on a principle which he most sincerely recommends to his countrymen, viz., not to spend more money in the country of our natural enemy than is required to support with decency the character of an Englishman . </p> <p>Because if the flashest French hotels are a bargain, how impossibly economical must the most basic be? Drive around any ring road and the answer will blare out at you from a yellow chequerboard hoarding marooned above the light-industrial wilderness: stay in a Formule 1 hotel and three people can share a room for less than a fiver a head. </p> <p>Ever since reading a newspaper story about the success of the Formule 1 phenomenon I had wanted to try one out. The chain owns 200 hotels in France (the first British outlets opened last year), an empire built on the simple premise that tramp and tycoon are equal in sleep. If you want saunas and pedicures, keep driving. But if your tastes are more ascetic, if all you want is a bed, veer wildly across the traffic and hurtle towards that yellow sign. </p> <p>Everyone arrives at an F1 by car, and it is relevant to point out here that I bumped into the razor-wired compound in the distant north Parisian suburb of Le Blanc-Mesnil behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce, albeit a hopelessly clapped-out Minder mobile acquired for less than the cost of a half-decent secondhand Fiesta. The idea had been simple enough: a Grand Tour in a grand tourer. But because this vehicle had not yet been adapted to run on Dijon mustard - even at French prices the daily fuel bill was an outrage against everything I hold dear - there would have to be compromises on the accommodation. Squeezing the Rolls into the only space wide enough - the one with the wheelchair painted in the middle - I calculated that the advertised F1 room rate of Fr119 represented a nightly saving worth up to three hours' driving at a steady 56mph. A couple of like-minded associates to split the bill (don't all rush at once) and we could even have splashed out on a motorway toll. </p> <p> The young receptionist eyed me incredulously as I clambered out of the Rolls, self-consciously removed the Spirit of Ecstasy and approached his little sentry box. 'Your first visit of Formule 1?' he inquired superfluously, glancing levelly at the Rolls before issuing the homely six-digit entry code that allowed access to my room. </p> <p>All F1 hotels are built to a standard modular designthat owes a debt to the twin design legacies of the Portakabin and Sweden's penal system. Pre-fab and low-rise from the outside, every fixture and fitting within was moulded from wincingly primary-coloured plastic made more painful by the reckless overuse of fluorescent striplighting. It was like the sort of institution you would expect to enter under sedation with your belt and shoelaces removed. And - beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-buzz-click - it was the same in the room itself. There were no sanitary fittings beyond a plugless, fag-burnt sink, and the TV remote control was welded to the bunk beds (single on top, double beneath). The dimensions were those of a cabin in steerage; from just beyond the double-glazed porthole roared lanes of autoroute traffic and, less constant but more memorable, a freight railway. I was at the coalface of budget Continental travel. </p> <p>Just as a Swedish jail must tread a fine line between decent humanity and a level of cosiness that might encourage recidivism, everything about the room was intended to deter the lingerer. More harsh lighting, more angular plastic; the tiny TV dangled from the ceiling at an angle designed to impact vertebrae after five minutes' viewing. Despite this, the set was plastered with anti-theft stickers, and when I ventured into the corridor in search of bathing facilities there were further indications that the clientele differed somewhat from my imagined F1 stereotypes: pennywise polyester reps and young couples on a budget break with their first child. Through an open door three men in vests were smoking with practised malevolence; the one on the top bunk blew his nose in the sheets as I passed, and the thought of his two friends snoring ruttily over each other on the double below was not one that repaid contemplation. Further down the corridor, a trio of floor-starers lurked conspiratorially beneath a sign requesting those patrons who wished to smoke in the shower not to leave their butts in the soap dish. </p> <p>The shower revealed itself as a pube- strewn cubicle half the size of an aircraft lavatory, and to economise on institutional laundry bills there weren't even any towels: you simply shut your eyes, pulled a cord on an industrial-sized version of those electric hand-dryers and cowered before a strident, flaying blast of diesel-scented air. </p> <p>But I had lost my F1 virginity, and as is often the way, the feelings of grubby self-loathing soon receded as the old lusts crept horribly back. It hadn't been cheerful, but my word it was cheap. Three days later, by way of redress for a fiercely contested on-the-spot parking fine, I had an F1 pit stop in the central town of Nevers; the night after that, defeated by the nerve-shredding logistics of piloting a car with a perimeter of more than 50ft up vertical inner-city alleys, I retreated to the suburbs of Lyon to drink once more from the poisoned wellspring of austerity. Because the sad truth is that whereas a night of lonely self-denial should engender a powerful reward stimulus - a slap-up meal, say, or a replacement set of headlamp beam deflectors - as a seasoned F1er I chose instead to raise the stakes, barricading myself in among the squalid detritus of skinflint extremity. A supper of Snickers and Kronenbourg; a sink-full of frothing underwear: beer bottle as plug, shampoo as detergent - in for a centime, in for a franc. </p> <p> Along with constant traffic whoosh, the distant but pervasive barking of a persistently stupid dog is a standard feature of all F1 hotels - the Do Not Disturb sign they give you to hang on your door should really be stuck outside the window, particularly given the improbability of being troubled by any service staff, except maybe to be asked why you haven't cleaned your ears out on the curtains yet. I was still scraping Snickers residue from the inside of my cheeks when, just after midnight, a deranged howl drew me to the window. But it wasn't a dog. There, beneath the billion-watt security lights, a mad and filthy Catweazle of an old dosser was bent over the Rolls's boot, one hand slapping the oiled haunch of a boiler-suit in time to his blurted caws and shrieks while the other hovered over the catch. </p> <p>For three long hours Catweazle circumnavigated the Rolls, peering at the drying socks draped over the headrests and the many bags (carrier, crisp, sleeping) bundled up in the footwells, bleating, squeaking, stooping to pluck a dog-end from the tarmac and stuff it into a pipe he kept in his breast pocket. Finally, halfway through my sixth Kronenbourg, I saw it: his hand darted speculatively at a door handle, and I had my evidence. A minute later, red-eyed, wild-haired, I was striding haphazardly about the reception area looking for someone to complain to, rehearsing an inept French mumble about the old naughty man wounding my car. But there was no one. Watching through the front window as Catweazle shambled empty-handed away from the Rolls to harvest recycled tobacco elsewhere, I figured it didn't matter. But then I got back up to my door, tried forlornly to recall even a small portion of my entry code and realised it did. </p> <p>The next night I slept in the car.</p> <p>\u0095 Tim Moore's 'Continental Drifter' (Little,Brown \u00a310.99) is published on 22 February.</p>",

Dinner for two, with beer, \u00a365 (though it would have easily fed three four). <p>I remember a time when my day didn't start until 11pm, when five or six nights a week I'd be up west, living it large and legless. I remember the time, and it was called My Youth. It was great and then, quite suddenly, it was enough. Through those Naugahyde-banquette and sweaty-walled club years, Soho at night was still the preserve of freaks and fashion victims frequenting fetid after-hours dives. Now, dancing to a corporate beat, it is mostly good clean megabuck-spinning fun. </p> <p>Me and late-night London W1 have long since lost interest in each other, but tonight, on a rainy January Tuesday, I'm still out at 11.30pm with a mission and a notebook. The streets are busy, slippery rinks for besuited beer boys eyeing up the leggy panda-eyed escapees from the local chorus lines.

In retrospect, perhaps I should have ordered it, but I like Mr Lam's Dr Seuss-ish vision of Geoduck and don't want to be disappointed.

I remember a time when my day didn't start until 11pm, when five or six nights a week I'd be up west, living it large and legless. I remember the time, and it was called My Youth. It was great and then, quite suddenly, it was enough. Through those Naugahyde-banquette and sweaty-walled club years, Soho at night was still the preserve of freaks and fashion victims frequenting fetid after-hours dives. Now, dancing to a corporate beat, it is mostly good clean megabuck-spinning fun. Me and late-night London W1 have long since lost interest in each other, but tonight, on a rainy January Tuesday, I'm still out at 11.30pm with a mission and a notebook. The streets are busy, slippery rinks for besuited beer boys eyeing up the leggy panda-eyed escapees from the local chorus lines.

The company's partners - Avery Dennison - have recently cancelled investment in external projects, leaving Holotag seeking alternative partners as a matter of urgency. 'It's a great system, but it does still need development,' said Rigby. robin.mckie@observer.co.uk",

So nobody should, in all honesty, have affected shocked surprise, as if this were some new modern outrage when, for seven days last August, the women and children of the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth, led by 33-year-old Katrina Kessell, marched and shouted and swore and bayed for the blood of local paedophiles. </p> <p>But the scenes were still fiercely ugly, in Paulsgrove and elsewhere, particularly to London commentators, of all political hues, who thought this kind of behaviour had been consigned to history along with buboes and ducking-stools. The condemnation was swift and righteous, and made more sustained by anger at the News of the World's 'name and shame' campaign, and the violent stupidity of the mobs it whipped up in the weeks following Sarah Payne's murder. Innocent families were hounded from their homes while convicted paedophiles went safely awol. A group in Gwent attacked a paediatrician by mistake. And right at the centre of it all, it seemed, was this spiky-haired Portsmouth harridan, self-appointed mouthpiece for the worst of the mobs, who became, last week, the first person to be convicted of public-order offences during that tawdry summer. </p> <p>What might surprise us instead is the fact that Katrina Kessell possesses not a brutal manipulative cynicism but a distressing naivety. She is far more vulnerable and nuanced than the cuttings - with their talk of 'aliens' and 'monsters' among us - would suggest. She's wrong-headed and self-deluding, and not given to lengthy discussion of such abstract concepts as irony, principle or the Rule of Law, but she's still not the cardboard cut-out tricoteuse of stereotyping. </p> <p>She's angry, for instance, at that News of the World campaign. 'I think they were wrong; they shouldn't have done it that way. I think it was all too cynical. And I don't think they checked everyone properly, which allowed mistakes, and damaged all of us.' She had been campaigning, she explained, for about a year before the paper's first 'outing', of convicted paedophile Victor Burnett, to have him removed from Paulsgrove. 'We'd been trying for a long time. Parents complained to police. People said things to Burnett. But their statements were just \"noted\" and nothing happened. </p> <p>'Anyway, after the paper came out, other people saw his picture and it kicked off. I went down to the green that night with the rest. There were a lot of people there, just chatting. And I suppose I found myself being shoved up the front. Sometimes I have a big mouth, I'm not afraid to say what I want to say, and I knew about Burnett.' And so she became spokeswoman and leader, and so was born Residents Against Paedophiles - and seven nights of foul vigilantism. </p> <p>Kessell accepts that it wasn't pretty. 'Yes, there can be something ugly about a mob.' And the use of the tiniest of children, chanting 'sex beast!' and 'hang him!'? </p> <p>'Yes, I know, some of that was out of order; they didn't really know what a paedophile was. But they do now. And you're right, I couldn't control everything. Every protest is going to have hangers-on. We tried to tell some of the teenagers to calm down. But, look, how else do you get noticed? How else is anyone going to listen to a common person like me? Even the local papers weren't interested before, let alone the nationals. At least we were being listened to, and we got something done. Answer me this: if you were a paedophile coming out of jail now, and you were offered a place in Paulsgrove, would you take it? I thought not. This is now the safest estate in England.' </p> <p>But at what cost? Kessell and her mother, Mavis Canizares, a blowsy fast-lipped blunderbuss of a woman who hardly lets her daughter get a word in, are adamant that no one was wrongly targeted by them; that the list of names of offenders, which they 'kept in our heads', was strictly checked. 'If a name came up we wouldn't do anything until we'd checked the library,' says Kessell. 'If a case went to court it would go in the papers; if it wasn't in the papers it wasn't proved.' </p> <p>They're wrong, of course. At least four innocent families fled the estate, and at least one convicted paedophile went to ground. One man was targeted because he lived alone and often spoke of how much he loved his mother. A policeman's nose was broken; cars were torched; truly, the mob ruled. </p> <p>Kessell appears honestly, naively, to believe this was nothing to do with her actions, and that she strove to stop the worst of it. She is also careful to distinguish between types of offence, distrusting the scatter-gun approach which brands anyone who has sex with an under-age girl as a paedophile; 'it's not paedophilia if they're given consent. I'm talking about the little ones. The ones who have no idea what's happening.' </p> <p>Such as herself. She talks quietly, hesitantly, with her mother out of the room, of the drive behind her anger, her own sexual abuse at the ages of five and six by her paternal grandfather. 'I was convinced I was just getting extra affection and attention. And no, I still haven't dealt with it, and I don't think I ever will. How do you deal with that? I'll take it to the grave.' </p> <p>Later, she was further abused after she was put into care by her mother. 'I had all of them, all on my own,' says Canizares defensively, 'and her and her brother were legging it off everywhere but I had three babies in the house so I was breaking the law if I went looking for them, so I went to the social services and asked how to cope and they couldn't help so I said fine, take them off my hands.' Did Kessell now, I asked, resent her mother for this? She shook her head. 'Not now, no. I've got children of my own, I know what it's like.' Five, in fact. The first was born when she was 16, after she was made pregnant while in care. Three more followed to a father who is now 'in a mental home. He fucked up on drugs'. The father of the youngest is back in his native Egypt. </p> <p>It was into this story, and thousands like it, and not into the quiet terraces of London's lawmakers and pontificators, that we dropped the country's convicted paedophiles, as we drop its more violent murderers and rapists on release, only to condemn the residents when they reacted in time-honoured fashion. Katrina Kessell got a result. Wrongly, stupidly, illegally, and helped by some brutal manipulative cynicism from rich journalists, she got a result. Just an everyday story of British council-house folk, from the First World War to 2001 and counting; of rough music, and rough justice.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>1 The Hustler</strong><br> Directed by Robert Rossen, 1961<br></p> <p> The best picture ever made about the enclosed world of games-playing professionals, this hard-boiled version of Pilgrim's Progress follows the cocky pool player Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman's finest performance) as he undergoes trials, tribulations and heartbreaks while making his painful journey from innocence to experience through seedy, smoke-filled pool halls of urban America. Jackie Gleason is the confident reigning champion he sets out to challenge, George C.

      "bodyText": "1 The Hustler Directed by Robert Rossen, 1961 The best picture ever made about the enclosed world of games-playing professionals, this hard-boiled version of Pilgrim's Progress follows the cocky pool player Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman's finest performance) as he undergoes trials, tribulations and heartbreaks while making his painful journey from innocence to experience through seedy, smoke-filled pool halls of urban America. Jackie Gleason is the confident reigning champion he sets out to challenge, George C. Scott the demonic gambler and promoter who takes over his life, and Piper Laurie the kindly alcoholic cripple he must cast aside in his quest for maturity. The pool contests are expertly staged to Kenyon Hopkins's cool jazz score, and Fast Eddie has an eloquent monologue on the excitement of competitive games. Odd Sporting Fact: The Hustler was a favourite of Samuel Beckett, the only Nobel laureate to have his cricketing prowess recorded in Wisden's Almanac. There's never been a half-way good cricket movie (except for The Lady Vanishes). 2 Raging Bull Martin Scorsese, 1980 There have been more movies about boxing than any other sport. Nearly every Hollywood actor from Charlie Chaplin to Woody Harrelson has gone into the ring and there have been a dozen or more biopics. But way out ahead and punching its weight in every scene is this knockout monochrome biopic for which Robert De Niro got an Oscar as the masochistic middleweight Jake La Motta, who won a world title and finished up a bloated, self-loathing outcast in search of salvation. Odd Sporting Fact: Jake La Motta had a small role in The Hustler as a bartender serving booze to Paul Neman, who four years earlier had come to stardom in Somebody Up There Likes Me, playing Rocky Graziano who preceded La Motta as world middleweight champion. 3 This Sporting Life Lindsay Anderson, 1963 Richard Harris seized his first major screen opportunity as a hulking, inarticulate rugby league star and crashed over the line to win several prizes (including Best Actor at Cannes) in a film based by David Storey on his own first novel. Rachel Roberts is superb as the withdrawn Yorkshire widow he hopelessly courts, the tight-knit northern social context of the game is sharply observed, and the matches themselves are staged with a brutal, hand-held immediacy. Odd Sporting Fact: Storey began writing The Sporting Life while dividing his time between attending art school in London and playing professionally for Leeds' A-team. The white Jaguar Harris drives is the car Storey bought with his Macmillan Fiction Prize money. 4 The Arsenal Stadium Mystery Thorold Dickinson, 1939 Nearly all football movies are dire: Ian McShane in Yesterday's Hero, Michael Caine in Escape to Victory, Sean Bean in When Saturday Comes - get out that red card. Gregory's Girl is sweet and there's Brian Glover (who trained as an all-in wrestler) in Kes. But still the best football movie is this prewar thriller in which Leslie Banks as a suave Scotland Yard inspector investigates a backstage murder at Highbury.

Odd Sporting Fact: The supporting cast includes Gunners' manager George Allison, trainer Tom Whittaker, newsreel commentator E.V.H.

Odd Sporting Fact: Writer-director Sayles plays the great journalist Ring Lardner, who both helped expose the Black Sox scandal and made professional sports a legitimate subject for literature (Kirk Douglas starred in the film of his boxing tale Champion). 9 Breaking Away Peter Yates, 1979 Made in the States by a British director, this unerringly accurate coming-of-age story centres on a quartet of blue-collar high-school graduates hanging around a mid-western university town, and especially on a teenage dreamer (Dennis Christopher) who becomes obsessed with cycling and adopts an Italian persona to distance himself from his grumpy used-car salesman father. He's disillusioned when a professional Italian cycling team cheat, but triumphs when he enters the annual Indiana University cycle race.

      "body": "<p>John Wayne once said that whenever he read a script, he asked himself the question: would it work as a western? In fact, several of his best films were famous stories transposed to the West. Stagecoach, for instance, is a frontier version of Maupassant's Boule de Suif and Red River is Mutiny on the Bounty reworked as a cattle drive film. </p> <p>This practice is fairly familiar (there are several westerns based on Shakespeare plays), and the British director Michael Winterbottom, who a couple of years ago made a straight version of Jude the Obscure, has had the ingenious notion of a relocating Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge to California's Sierra Nevada in the 1860s. His film, The Claim, scripted by Frank Cottrell Boyce, is an enjoyable film of some distinction. </p> <p>Hardy's story, set mostly in the 1840s, centres on Thomas Henchard, a hard drinking, unemployed Wessex farmworker, who, drunk and desperate, sells his wife and baby daughter to a sailor for five guineas. Then, forswearing the bottle, he recreates himself, becoming a wealthy corn merchant and pillar of society, only for his life to unravel when the sick wife and grown-up daughter return. A mixture of pigheadedness, fate and economic change lead to his downfall and destruction. </p> <p>In the Winterbottom-Boyce film, Henchard becomes the Irishman Daniel Dillon (Peter Mullan), a failed, hard-drinking prospector in the early days of the California Gold Rush, who exchanges his wife Elena (Nastassja Kinski) and baby daughter Hope (Sarah Polley) for another prospector's dubious claim. In consequence, he becomes rich and powerful as the dominant figure in the remote mountain township of Kingdom Come. Old passions and guilts are stirred when the dying Elena brings Hope to him some 18 years later. </p> <p>The novel's central thrust remains and the chief characters have their cinematic counterparts, Hardy's vigorous young Scottish businessman Farfrae becoming the dedicated Central Pacific Railroad engineer Dalglish (Wes Bentley) and the independently wealthy Lucetta turning into the prosperous brothel-keeper Lucia (Milla Jovovich). The film is still set at a time of social disruption - the Gold Rush has created sudden fortunes and transformed the western economy, the railroads are about to link the Atlantic and the Pacific. </p> <p>But we are often wrong-footed by expecting the film to follow Hardy. A lot of the novel's complicated plotting and sudden climaxes (in part necessitated by weekly serialisation) have been jettisoned, and the new setting has propelled The Claim into taking on a life of its own. One inevitably wonders, of course, how much of the film's power comes from Hardy and the feelings we bring from the novel. </p> <p> The Claim telescopes its events into one extended, brutal winter during which the engineers not merely conduct the survey, which leads to Kingdom Come being rejected in favour of a new town down in the valley, but actually build the railroad. Shot in the Canadian Rockies, the film's snow appears real and plentiful, a rare thing in the movies. Mullan and the rest of the cast look as if they've lived through hard, cold times and there is an authentic feeling for frontier life in the ramshackle buildings huddled together and the warm, ornate interiors of the plush saloon and of Dillon's mansion with its grand piano and hefty furniture. </p> <p>There are nice touches, like the recitation of poems holding the scruffy miners entranced as they down their whiskey, and the French quack brought in by Dillon to revivify the dying Elena with electric shock treatment. But the condensation of the events leads to occasional confusions, and as with all movies that take place under perpetual snow (Altman's not dissimilar McCabe and Mrs Miller, for instance), a curiously muffled and frozen atmosphere creeps into the drama and the characters' emotions. </p> <p>One of the chief disparities between the film and the novel is that Dillon becomes a different kind of tragic hero from Henchard. Henchard is an immense, sad, self-destructive man of great decency who brings about his own downfall. Dillon, however, is ultimately seen as one of those self-made men who goes out in an inferno of blazing glory to be memorialised by Dalglish, the agent of his destruction, with the words: \"They were like kings, the pioneers, they came here when there was nothing.\" </p> <p>This is a characteristic sentiment of the western genre and The Claim, rather than just being a costume film set in the West, qualifies as a western. Though there isn't a great deal of conventional action, what there is is impressive - three lethal shootings, some fisticuffs, a whipping and the explosion of a wagonload of nitroglycerin that sends a flaming horse galloping across the snow in the film's most memorable image. </p> <p>I can hear the dying western genre lying on the saloon steps calling out: 'Kiss me, Hardy', and if The Claim proves a success perhaps there'll be a string of transfers from Wessex to the West. Anticipating this, I've copyrighted some titles and plots - 'Tess of Death Valley', 'Under the Hanging Tree', 'Trumpet Major Dundee', 'The Badlanders' (though that's actually been used for the western version of The Asphalt Jungle), 'Return of the Native American', 'Dude the Insecure' and 'Fire From the Ma Dene Crowd' (in this one, Bathsheba Everdene has become a tough ranch boss).</p>",

Dillon, however, is ultimately seen as one of those self-made men who goes out in an inferno of blazing glory to be memorialised by Dalglish, the agent of his destruction, with the words: \"They were like kings, the pioneers, they came here when there was nothing.\" This is a characteristic sentiment of the western genre and The Claim, rather than just being a costume film set in the West, qualifies as a western. Though there isn't a great deal of conventional action, what there is is impressive - three lethal shootings, some fisticuffs, a whipping and the explosion of a wagonload of nitroglycerin that sends a flaming horse galloping across the snow in the film's most memorable image. I can hear the dying western genre lying on the saloon steps calling out: 'Kiss me, Hardy', and if The Claim proves a success perhaps there'll be a string of transfers from Wessex to the West. Anticipating this, I've copyrighted some titles and plots - 'Tess of Death Valley', 'Under the Hanging Tree', 'Trumpet Major Dundee', 'The Badlanders' (though that's actually been used for the western version of The Asphalt Jungle), 'Return of the Native American', 'Dude the Insecure' and 'Fire From the Ma Dene Crowd' (in this one, Bathsheba Everdene has become a tough ranch boss).",

      "body": "<p>I'm scared about meeting Amanda Donohoe. The last time she talked to an Observer journalist, six years ago, she was sensationally bolshy and rude. 'What a stupid question!' she said when asked something innocuous about her background, and 'Do you know, I am really bored with this conversation,' and 'How much do you earn, anyway? How can you live on that?' </p> <p>Because she is such a bugger to spend time with, constantly ticking off hacks and telling them how to do their jobs, Donohoe, unlike so many of her colleagues in the acting fraternity, has always made for great copy, because it would seem that she has never really felt the need to make herself likeable. </p> <p>Anyway, here is The Observer, greedy for punishment. Things are looking promising. Amanda is late: 10, 15 minutes, half an hour. I'm told that she's on her way from the hairdresser's, and then someone else says that of course she should be getting out of rehearsals any moment now. </p> <p>Because Amanda is about to inherit Mrs Robinson's famous stockings (and that nudie scene) from Jerry Hall, I'm sitting in the Soho offices of The Graduate 's co-producer Sacha Brookes, and he is explaining that casting Mrs R is just a matter of closing one's eyes and sticking a pin in a personal fantasy wishlist, and the photographer is getting into it, suggesting Greta Scacchi and 'who else did I fancy in the early Eighties?' </p> <p>Then Amanda arrives, pipe-cleaner thin in cream cashmere and silver trainers, with slippy, salon-fresh chestnut hair, smelling very expensive. </p> <p>It is immediately apparent - and actually, I won't pretend to be disappointed about this - that she is in a very good mood today, thespily throwing herself at the feet of one of Mr Brookes's assistants who provides a packet of cigarettes, and letting rip with her sexy, smoke-edged laugh, not least when she wants to signpost a remark as not entirely serious, which, to my surprise, is fairly often. </p> <p>Is this her fourth or fifth window of opportunity? Fact is, Amanda, the daughter of two north London antique dealers, first squared up to fame as a 15-year-old when she started dating Adam Ant, then on the very threshold of pop stardom. After training at Central, she reappeared in Nic Roeg's notorious Castaway (1986) which cast her opposite Oliver Reed and obliged her to spend most of the shoot in the buff. </p> <p>Her costumes stayed minimal in the follow-up roles (several Ken Russell flicks), and somehow it was not a surprise when she departed for the States, where she did a two-year (1990-92) stint as a gay attorney on LA Law. Her comparatively recent relaunch as a stage actress (Miss Julie, Snoo Wilson's HRH) has been well received by the critics. </p> <p>Every evolutionary step has been logged by interviewers and, as she has never been one to take any prisoners (probably one reason why the key roles never came her way after she moved to Hollywood), those earlier incarnations haunt her still. She mentions her age, 38, twice during the interview, defying the conventions of her profession; but then again, you might do the same if you were always being asked to comment on some off-the-cuff remark you smacked towards the boundary 20 years ago. </p> <p>'My first love affair was on the front page of every bloody newspaper. My first betrayal on the front page. It was very odd, to grow up like that,' says Donohoe, leaning back into a scarlet sofa and tilting a big glass of red wine towards her. 'You should be careful what you wish for. I very much wanted that sort of exposure, but I had no idea what the cost of it would be. I just wanted to be popular, famous and successful at what I did. I didn't really think of the consequences at all. That's how you start.' </p> <p>And because she started so young, and wore so few clothes on screen, and was always articulate and sometimes reckless in interviews, she was all over the tabloids: a pushmepullyou scenario. 'The press condemned me for my rebelliousness, but they wanted it, too. So I was given very mixed messages about what I was doing. I was encouraged on one hand to be vocal, and then told that I talked too much, or that I talked rubbish. I didn't know what was going on. It made me very untrusting. I don't have a lot of trust.' </p> <p>The funny thing is that today she is a very generous interviewee - very trusting, really. When I ask if it's true that she has decided to leave Los Angeles, where she has lived since 1989, and come back to London for good, she confirms it: LA, for all the sunshine, or perhaps because of it, 'is like an anaesthetic: it numbs you. I bought into that, sat on my arse, and that seemed to be enough for a while.' It was, until she turned 35. </p> <p>The only recent strong role for an 'older woman' that she can think of - she really went after it - was that of presidential press secretary C.J. Cregg in TV's The West Wing, bagged by Allison Janney. 'No matter who you are, Elizabeth Taylor, Michelle Pfeiffer, it's over at a certain age. And then you either get bitter, or you move on. I've been very lucky because I've had the English stage to move back to.' She's always kept one toe on it, doing theatre in London and Manchester between screen outings in Liar Liar and The Madness of King George. Now her ambition is to pull off a Judi Dench, a Francesca Annis or a Helen Mirren. </p> <p>But there was another fundamental problem with LA. 'I also found it very difficult to find American men that I found interesting for more than a couple of months, and that was really getting me down. For all my complaining I do love England, and I do love Englishmen. It's only when you've lived abroad and dealt with other cultures, and the men in them, that you realise that actually English blokes are all right. They really are.' </p> <p>Over the past few years, Donohoe, whose exes include the filmmaker Nick Broomfield, has taken a gloomier line on relationships. In 1997, announcing that the time had come for her to try the single life, she told the Sunday Times: 'I had one big lie too many.' So, why the change of heart? 'I had a couple of relationships with American men, but they didn't last very long. </p> <p>'Lovely, lovely charming people, but I'd make a joke and they wouldn't understand it. That's when the warning signals started going off. And they were so goddamn polite - and if they're not goddamn polite, they're not very inventively rude, either. And then they stab you in the back with a big smile. Here people pretty much say what's on their mind. And on the whole, I'd rather see the knife coming at me.' </p> <p>A little indignant that chaps her own age seem preoccupied with younger women, she is chuffed, if not entirely consoled, that the next generation still seem interested. 'It's not that I'm chasing younger men; they're chasing me. And I say, \"Darling, you know, you're gorgeous, but it would be cradle snatching.\"' </p> <p>Her time as a singleton has been useful; she feels as if she has sorted herself out a bit. 'And now I think I'm quite ready. But I don't want another series of affairs. I want some kind of deeper, more permanent relationship. I don't mean marriage, I'm not looking for marriage. No, I'm looking for a companion. A person to share all sorts of interests...' and suddenly she cackles, witchily, 'as well as sex.' </p> <p>Her peculiar sort of UHT fame has always got in the way of relationships. 'I'd never noticed this before until recently, perhaps I've been too self-absorbed. It's really funny - when you meet people, they have this slightly glazed, excited look about them. They're not looking at you or listening to you. They're looking at the celebrity - at the veneer, at their own fantasy, if you like. And that is so offputting, I can't even tell you.' </p> <p>She's sure that when she first arrived in Hollywood, she wore the same expression, and it didn't make for interesting conversation then, either. 'That's why celebrities date celebrities. It's a shortcut to an intimacy. You've both been there, done that. That's daft, really. I mean, I don't want to date a celebrity. I want a person, a normal human being.' She leans towards my tape recorder. 'Is there anybody out there?' </p> <p>So Amanda is letting down the drawbridge. Her parents have been the first to cross it. Having spent most of her life being rather dismissive of her mother and father and their sensible, middle-class approach to life, she is now making amends. When she went to the States, she slipped into the habit of only ringing home on feast days, so when friends who had lost their parents before making peace expressed regret: 'That was a bit of an eye-opener'. </p> <p>The clincher came with the deaths of Diana and JFK Jr which - apparently for the first time - forced Amanda to accept the fact that she was not immortal. 'Life is short and unpredictable and I suppose it has taken me till 38 to grasp that.' There was a reconciliation, a few tears, an apology, and she has since discovered a maniacal curiosity about her Irish, Russian and Swiss family roots. 'It does help,' she says. 'It helps you to figure out where you're going, where you came from, who you might be.' </p> <p>She's house-hunting at the moment, around north London, where she grew up. 'I have been incredibly undisciplined in my life. I've had a party, and now the party's over. Well, it's not that the party is over ,' she amends, hastily, 'but I'm not going to wake up with a hangover the next day.'</p> <p> I do like the way she's going about it: rootling around in a box of Godiva chocolates she has spotted on the coffee table, lighting another fag, pouring some more wine. Let's not get carried away: Donohoe has not mellowed and, fingers crossed, never will. If she approves of something, she will say that it 'gives you a good kick up the arse'. Change is good. Unpredictability is good. </p> <p>Perhaps this is a necessary quality in someone who has spent their life striking attitudes for the media, but there's a splendid defiance to her U-turns. In her late teens, she was forever tripping off on CND rallies. </p> <p>Now she is proud to front the new recruitment commercials for the Royal Navy. Her position changed, she says, after Kosovo. 'I grew up. I'm certainly not for the nuclear bomb, and I don't give a damn about the politicians: they send young men and women to their deaths without batting an eyelid. But the fact is that these young men and women are brave enough to go out there, risking their lives for us, for peace, whatever that means, and I think that they deserve respect, attention and support.' </p> <p>Do you know, I think Amanda Donohoe is terrific. She wears her heart on her sleeve, and a very healthy organ it is, too, even if it beats to a slightly erratic rhythm. She will defend every caprice - and she's a creature of them - to the hilt, at least until the wind changes. I've caught her on a good day, when she says she's hoping to find a decent chap, doesn't want children and is thrilled to be back in London, but I don't doubt that someone else, meeting her next week, would find her in a terrible strop, renouncing men, planning to adopt, and packing her bags for Paris. </p> <p>Donohoe wants an interesting life, not an easy one, and this means that even the trivial can suddenly be transformed into the epic. Take any mundane activity: clothes-shopping in London, for instance. 'You walk into a shop,' she says, 'and it's like they're doing you a favour. This shop assistant said, \"Nah, you can't take more than six pieces into the changing rooms,\" and I thought, \"Do you want to give me any service at all, or shall I just fall to my knees and beg you to let me use the changing room?\" I tried a few things on, finally found something to fit me and went to the cash desk, and then I thought, they really don't deserve my custom. So I said, \"Do you know what? I've changed my mind. Bye-ee!\" So now my pride is intact, but I have no trousers to wear. What's a girl to do?' </p> <p>\u0095 Amanda Donohoe opens in The Graduate on 21 February.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This year's Sundance Film Festival was a lacklustre one only if, like many of its buzz-crazed attendees, you think that acquisition activity is a reliable index of health. Park City, Utah, underwent its annual transformation from tranquil ski resort to schmooze-fest, but the open cheque books were gone, replaced by an air of frugality. Responding to the economic slowdown, film distributors bided their time, and when they finally forked out the cash, it was obvious that they were in no mood for adventure. </p> <p>Celebrity distractions were scarce: founding father Robert Redford was in Europe shooting Tony Scott's The Spy Game, and the biggest tremor came at the premiere of Michael Apted's Enigma when Mick Jagger appeared. </p> <p>Still, if your primary concern was the vitality of cinema, Sundance 2001 offered one unexpected depth charge after another. All week, programming director Geoff Gilmore introduced screenings by defying pundits to single out a trend. For what it's worth, the iconic figures of this festival were not wisecracking thugs or dysfunctional suburbanites but tormented mothers. One of them, Sissy Spacek, shared a special jury prize with British actor Tom Wilkinson - both are extraordinary as Waspish New England parents coping with sudden tragedy in Todd Field's debut, In the Bedroom. </p> <p>A character actor of some repute (he played Tom Cruise's jazz-pianist friend in Eyes Wide Shut ), Field proves himself a filmmaker of rigour with this unblinking study of bereavement. The movie was bought by Miramax - perhaps not an ideal outcome, given its 140-minute running time and studio boss Harvey 'Scissorhands' Weinstein's track record for denying directors the final cut. </p> <p>The best-kept secret of the festival was Christopher Munch's The Sleepy Time Gal, which stars Jacqueline Bisset as a former radio personality confronting cancer. Munch is among the most idiosyncratic of American directors, and this film fuses yearning poetics with a diffuse style. Tilda Swinton's radiant performance as a blackmailed mother protecting her gay son, constitutes the aching heart of The Deep End - a lush remake of Max Ophuls's The Reckless Moment. Sundance has always functioned as a Petri dish for calculated provocations.

      "bodyText": "This year's Sundance Film Festival was a lacklustre one only if, like many of its buzz-crazed attendees, you think that acquisition activity is a reliable index of health. Park City, Utah, underwent its annual transformation from tranquil ski resort to schmooze-fest, but the open cheque books were gone, replaced by an air of frugality. Responding to the economic slowdown, film distributors bided their time, and when they finally forked out the cash, it was obvious that they were in no mood for adventure. Celebrity distractions were scarce: founding father Robert Redford was in Europe shooting Tony Scott's The Spy Game, and the biggest tremor came at the premiere of Michael Apted's Enigma when Mick Jagger appeared. Still, if your primary concern was the vitality of cinema, Sundance 2001 offered one unexpected depth charge after another. All week, programming director Geoff Gilmore introduced screenings by defying pundits to single out a trend. For what it's worth, the iconic figures of this festival were not wisecracking thugs or dysfunctional suburbanites but tormented mothers. One of them, Sissy Spacek, shared a special jury prize with British actor Tom Wilkinson - both are extraordinary as Waspish New England parents coping with sudden tragedy in Todd Field's debut, In the Bedroom. A character actor of some repute (he played Tom Cruise's jazz-pianist friend in Eyes Wide Shut ), Field proves himself a filmmaker of rigour with this unblinking study of bereavement. The movie was bought by Miramax - perhaps not an ideal outcome, given its 140-minute running time and studio boss Harvey 'Scissorhands' Weinstein's track record for denying directors the final cut. The best-kept secret of the festival was Christopher Munch's The Sleepy Time Gal, which stars Jacqueline Bisset as a former radio personality confronting cancer. Munch is among the most idiosyncratic of American directors, and this film fuses yearning poetics with a diffuse style. Tilda Swinton's radiant performance as a blackmailed mother protecting her gay son, constitutes the aching heart of The Deep End - a lush remake of Max Ophuls's The Reckless Moment. Sundance has always functioned as a Petri dish for calculated provocations. This year's worst offender, L.I.E., casts a kind-hearted pederast as surrogate father to a gay teenager. A more convincing button-pusher, Henry Bean's directorial debut The Believer, won the grand jury prize. Bean, whose scripts include Internal Affairs and Deep Cover, is drawn to belligerent, masculine men, and here he serves up his most egregious contradiction yet: a Jewish neo-Nazi. Dismissed by most, Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko, about an overmedicated teen obsessed with time travel, had a topicality unique among the fiction films. Set in the month leading up to the 1988 Bush-Dukakis contest, it premiered on the eve of the Bush II inauguration. A period piece that never recoils from the rancid aspect of nostalgia, this infuriating yet impressive film combines the underdog empathy of Wes Anderson with the bravura of Paul Thomas Anderson. \u0095 Dennis Lim is film editor of the Village Voice.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Making a film', Terry Gilliam tells me, 'is essentially about two things: belief and momentum. You need those two essential elements, one feeding the other, or things fall apart.' There speaks the voice of experience. Last September, just five days into an ambitious shooting schedule, Gilliam's film, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, a vision he had nurtured for 10 years, collapsed in the most cruelly ironic fashion. A full five months later, the director, whose belief in the project had propelled its often tortuous progress from script to shoot, is still in grief: more than once he refers to this interview as 'a kind of therapy session'. </p> <p>'A part of me still doesn't quite believe it happened,' he says, nursing a pre-lunch malt whisky in a Soho private members' club, his natural ebullience suddenly replaced by an uncharacteristically rueful tone. 'I mean, it had been a difficult project from day one, but what happened was so cruelly absurd, so surreal and devastating, I think it still has a grip on me.' What happened was also utterly beyond his control. On day one of the shoot, amid the brown, sun-burnished hills of Aragon and Navarra in northern Spain, 70-year-old Jean Rochefort, who had landed the part on Gilliam's insistence - 'He could act, he could horse ride, he was Don Quixote' - began feeling ill. He was suffering from a prostate infection, but, as Gilliam attests: 'It suddenly seemed a lot more serious. He looked like an 80-year-old rather than a 70-year-old and it was obvious he was in pain. Day one and already we were in deep shit.' </p> <p>On the second day, while the film's main star Johnny Depp prepared to shoot his initial scenes, the heavens opened and a flash flood washed away the entire set. 'It was a tempest,' says Gilliam, a man, as his films illustrate, not naturally inclined to understatement. 'It was like a punishment for everything bad I had ever done in my life. It was like Job.' </p> <p>On day four, while the crew tried to rebuild the set and scrape layers of mud from costumes and props, Gilliam realised that the entire landscape had changed colour. 'Nothing matched. We were trying to fake shots, anything to keep going.' </p> <p>On day five, the first assistant director took the already exhausted director aside and said he was refusing to let Jean Rochefort continue working. A row ensued. Rochefort, though now in serious pain, insisted on getting back in the saddle. The cameras rolled for an hour. It took three men to get him down off the horse; the next day he was airlifted to hospital in Paris where he was operated on for a double hernia. 'And that,' sighs Gilliam, 'was the end of the movie.' </p> <p>But not, unfortunately, the end of the story. When the news broke that neither Depp nor his partner, Vanessa Paradis, could wait around for Rochefort to recover due to other film commitments, some insurers decided to pull the plug on the project. It is nothing short of a miracle, given that the film's complicated financial backing came from England, Spain, France and Germany, that all major investors have since been paid back. With the total insurance bill sitting at an estimated $16 million, it remains to be seen if cast and crew will be as fortunate. </p> <p>'Initially, the insurers wanted us to recast and reshoot within four weeks but that was an impossibility,' says the director, whose previous films include Brazil, The Fisher King and Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, as well as Baron Munchausen, an equally ambitious Hollywood studio backed film which spiralled over budget back in 1989. 'There is no way I could have found a replacement for Jean in that time, plus the other actors had prior commitments and the locations had been lined up months in advance for specific dates.' </p> <p>The movies was a troubled project, though, long before the director, cast and crew decamped to Spain. Gilliam first dreamt up the film when he was suffering from what he calls PMS (Post Munchausen Syndrome) back in 1990. </p> <p>'I called my old friend Jake Eberts (the executive producer of Munchausen), and said, \"I have two names for you: Quixote and Gilliam. And I need $20m.\" He said, \"Done!\" I then sat down and read the book and thought, Jesus, this is unfilmable.' (It speaks volumes about both Gilliam's methodology and his self-belief that he pitched the idea for the film without having read the book, and that, having read the book and realised he had an impossible task on his hands, then set about the project with the kind of blind faith that Quixote himself would have been proud of.) </p> <p>From the start, Gilliam, perhaps chastened by his experiences in Hollywood, wanted to make the film in Europe, with European money. He took the script initially to US producer Chuck Roven (with whom he had worked on 12 Monkeys ) and to the London-based Sarah Radclyffe Productions,. Together, Gilliam and Radclyffe approached Path\u00e9 Films, who had just set up offices in London, and Canal Plus in Paris. 'We started to do a little dance,' says Gilliam, 'and these dances take a long time - especially where the French are concerned.' </p> <p>By then, the proposed budget had gone up to $35m. Enter Rainer Mockert, a German producer whose very name causes Gilliam to wince. According to the director, Mockert's enthusiasm for the project won everyone over, and as the shooting date of summer 1999 neared, his proposed slice of the budget grew and grew. In July, though, one month before the shoot, Mockert's promised money, which was to come from a private German tax shelter fund, had still not materialised. </p> <p>As Mockert pleaded for more time, Depp was offered the lead in Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried . 'We were desperately trying to keep Johnny on board and he was committed to the film,' Gilliam elaborates, 'but he was being offered $2m for three weeks' work while we were expecting him to do 17 weeks' work for the same fee.' In the end, according to Gilliam: 'Rainer just didn't have the money. Legally the documents were there, but nothing was signed. He wanted us to put back the schedule but a film is like air traffic control, you're locking in all the pieces in order that everything moves forward according to plan.' </p> <p>Angered, but undaunted, Gilliam continued his increasingly complex dance with the European backers. A bridge of $500,000 was provided by London production company, @radical media, who handled Gilliam's rare sorties into commercials. With the Path\u00e9 money still in place, Ren\u00e9 Cleitman from another French company, Hachette Premiere, took over production in August 1999, demanding a new budget and schedule, and promising to have the money in place by the end of November. </p> <p>'The problem was, Ren\u00e9 would not speak to Sarah Radclyffe, who had loads of knowledge, and was being very gracious even though she was no longer attached to the film.' Soon after, a meeting with Path\u00e9 further stoked Gilliam's now burgeoning frustration with the French way of doing business. </p> <p>'Suddenly, in the middle of a script meeting, Alexis Lloyd (erstwhile managing director of Path\u00e9 UK) starts talking about money, saying they want the budget brought down to $25m. I got on the phone to the other financiers and started screaming. Canal Plus and Path\u00e9 were so embarrassed, they immediately offered us some money.' </p> <p>Finally, in January 2000, Cleitman proposed a revised budget of \u00a331m. Depp, meanwhile, having finished shooting the Sally Potter part, now had another offer for a much bigger budget movie, entitled Blow. 'We still don't have the right money, the lawyers are taking forever because we've stumbled into a pan-European tax nightmare because the rules are different in every country. Everyone, including myself and the writer, Tony Grisoni, is working for nothing. The process is dragging on interminably and killing the momentum. The only person who is happy is Jean Rochefort who is steadily working away learning English.' </p> <p>It was around this time, Gilliam says, that he 'realised the abyss between Hollywood and France'. To secure a star such as Johnny Depp, it is common, in America at least, to offer what is known as a pay-or-play deal, which ensures that the actor gets paid even if the film is not made. </p> <p>This, according to Gilliam, was anathema to the French, who are suspicious of all things Hollywood. 'They just could not, or would not, understand that without the star, the film does not get made.' British film producer Andrea Calderwood, who then worked as head of production at Path\u00e9, and had fought hard to back Gilliam's vision, concurs: 'I had one French producer say to me, \"It's not for us to commit to Johnny Depp, it's for him to commit to us\".' </p> <p>Calderwood, who was responsible at Path\u00e9 for backing The Claim, an equally ambitious film by British director, Michael Winterbottom [reviewed on page 7], and who was instrumental in securing \u00a32m from Lottery funds for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, pinpoints what is perhaps the key subtext to this salutary story. </p> <p>'There is a different approach to filmmaking in France. The producer, for instance, can be personally responsible for the finance, and can often bond the film themselves. That obviously affects the producer's relationship towards the film. I also think there was a general nervousness about Terry who is seen, rather unfairly, as a maverick but, who actually has an incredibly good understanding of the realities involved in the financing and production process. He took a lot of responsibility for pushing through the financial negotiations and I often felt frustrated on his behalf because ultimately there seemed to be a fundamental lack of confidence in his ability to deliver the film for the money.' </p> <p>In the end, the film went ahead when new German investors KC Medien came on board, but not before another eleventh-hour drama occurred. Just before the October shoot, with the \u00a332m budget finally in place, Gilliam received a call from an aggrieved Johnny Depp who, by now, 'was convinced that he was being majorly jerked around by the French'. Depp's agent had only just got around to telling the actor the exact figure he would earn for starring in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. </p> <p>'Johnny was already becoming obsessional about the film but, when the actual amount was mentioned, he went apeshit. He told me he wanted twice as much. All the money's in place, and this happens.' In the end, Gilliam, who was already working for half his normal fee, settled for a quarter, and Johnny Depp settled for half again of what he wanted. </p> <p>Thus, the long, complex and ill-omened pre-production financial dance finally ended. If there was a bigger lesson to be learnt from all this, it is best summed up by Andrea Calderwood, who now fronts her own production company, Slate Films: 'There's a general consensus that we should be making bigger scale European films, say $20m and upwards. In order to do that, we need to have the confidence to back directors who can work at that scale.' </p> <p> The Man Who Killed Don Quixote did, in the end, start shooting last October. The rest, as they say, is history: a flash flood and a double hernia finally did what the money men, the lawyers and the oceans of Euro red tape had failed to do - kill off Gilliam's decade-long labour of love in a matter of days. </p> <p>'It's funny,' he sighs, 'but I always find that the process of making a film tends to echo the actual story and, in this case, I started to feel like Quixote, always tilting at windmills. The thing is, though, if I am being honest, there was a certain relief when it collapsed. For the first time in my life, I was starting a film and I didn't feel joyful. There was about six hours of joy when me and Johnny were shooting together in the desert, getting ideas, inventing stuff. But, that was it. It just didn't feel right. I was exhausted by all the other stuff. I guess I need that joy in order to work.' </p> <p>We will have to wait and see whether The Man Who Killed Don Quixote will be attempted a third time, though the director is adamant it will. 'I am going to make this damn film,' he shouts at one point, 'but maybe down the line. I can't even look at it right now. I can't even think about it. I mean, I'm supposed to be shooting right now, out there surrounded by creative people, thinking up new ideas, in my element. Instead, I'm sitting at home on the computer again. It's not,' he adds, 'the same thing at all.' </p> <p> \u00a9 Sean O'Hagan </p> <p><strong>Just Gilliam</strong><br><strong>Chloe Diski</strong></p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> 22 November 1940 in Medicine Lake, Minnesota. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Birmingham High School and Occidental College; studied political science. </p> <p><strong> Jobs:</strong> Included spells in an architect's office, a New York advertising agency and assistant editor at Help! magazine.

      "bodyText": "'Making a film', Terry Gilliam tells me, 'is essentially about two things: belief and momentum. You need those two essential elements, one feeding the other, or things fall apart.' There speaks the voice of experience. Last September, just five days into an ambitious shooting schedule, Gilliam's film, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, a vision he had nurtured for 10 years, collapsed in the most cruelly ironic fashion. A full five months later, the director, whose belief in the project had propelled its often tortuous progress from script to shoot, is still in grief: more than once he refers to this interview as 'a kind of therapy session'. 'A part of me still doesn't quite believe it happened,' he says, nursing a pre-lunch malt whisky in a Soho private members' club, his natural ebullience suddenly replaced by an uncharacteristically rueful tone. 'I mean, it had been a difficult project from day one, but what happened was so cruelly absurd, so surreal and devastating, I think it still has a grip on me.' What happened was also utterly beyond his control. On day one of the shoot, amid the brown, sun-burnished hills of Aragon and Navarra in northern Spain, 70-year-old Jean Rochefort, who had landed the part on Gilliam's insistence - 'He could act, he could horse ride, he was Don Quixote' - began feeling ill. He was suffering from a prostate infection, but, as Gilliam attests: 'It suddenly seemed a lot more serious. He looked like an 80-year-old rather than a 70-year-old and it was obvious he was in pain. Day one and already we were in deep shit.' On the second day, while the film's main star Johnny Depp prepared to shoot his initial scenes, the heavens opened and a flash flood washed away the entire set. 'It was a tempest,' says Gilliam, a man, as his films illustrate, not naturally inclined to understatement. 'It was like a punishment for everything bad I had ever done in my life. It was like Job.' On day four, while the crew tried to rebuild the set and scrape layers of mud from costumes and props, Gilliam realised that the entire landscape had changed colour. 'Nothing matched. We were trying to fake shots, anything to keep going.' On day five, the first assistant director took the already exhausted director aside and said he was refusing to let Jean Rochefort continue working. A row ensued. Rochefort, though now in serious pain, insisted on getting back in the saddle. The cameras rolled for an hour. It took three men to get him down off the horse; the next day he was airlifted to hospital in Paris where he was operated on for a double hernia. 'And that,' sighs Gilliam, 'was the end of the movie.' But not, unfortunately, the end of the story. When the news broke that neither Depp nor his partner, Vanessa Paradis, could wait around for Rochefort to recover due to other film commitments, some insurers decided to pull the plug on the project. It is nothing short of a miracle, given that the film's complicated financial backing came from England, Spain, France and Germany, that all major investors have since been paid back. With the total insurance bill sitting at an estimated $16 million, it remains to be seen if cast and crew will be as fortunate. 'Initially, the insurers wanted us to recast and reshoot within four weeks but that was an impossibility,' says the director, whose previous films include Brazil, The Fisher King and Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, as well as Baron Munchausen, an equally ambitious Hollywood studio backed film which spiralled over budget back in 1989. 'There is no way I could have found a replacement for Jean in that time, plus the other actors had prior commitments and the locations had been lined up months in advance for specific dates.' The movies was a troubled project, though, long before the director, cast and crew decamped to Spain. Gilliam first dreamt up the film when he was suffering from what he calls PMS (Post Munchausen Syndrome) back in 1990. 'I called my old friend Jake Eberts (the executive producer of Munchausen), and said, \"I have two names for you: Quixote and Gilliam. And I need $20m.\" He said, \"Done!\" I then sat down and read the book and thought, Jesus, this is unfilmable.' (It speaks volumes about both Gilliam's methodology and his self-belief that he pitched the idea for the film without having read the book, and that, having read the book and realised he had an impossible task on his hands, then set about the project with the kind of blind faith that Quixote himself would have been proud of.) From the start, Gilliam, perhaps chastened by his experiences in Hollywood, wanted to make the film in Europe, with European money. He took the script initially to US producer Chuck Roven (with whom he had worked on 12 Monkeys ) and to the London-based Sarah Radclyffe Productions,. Together, Gilliam and Radclyffe approached Path\u00e9 Films, who had just set up offices in London, and Canal Plus in Paris. 'We started to do a little dance,' says Gilliam, 'and these dances take a long time - especially where the French are concerned.' By then, the proposed budget had gone up to $35m. Enter Rainer Mockert, a German producer whose very name causes Gilliam to wince. According to the director, Mockert's enthusiasm for the project won everyone over, and as the shooting date of summer 1999 neared, his proposed slice of the budget grew and grew. In July, though, one month before the shoot, Mockert's promised money, which was to come from a private German tax shelter fund, had still not materialised. As Mockert pleaded for more time, Depp was offered the lead in Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried . 'We were desperately trying to keep Johnny on board and he was committed to the film,' Gilliam elaborates, 'but he was being offered $2m for three weeks' work while we were expecting him to do 17 weeks' work for the same fee.' In the end, according to Gilliam: 'Rainer just didn't have the money. Legally the documents were there, but nothing was signed. He wanted us to put back the schedule but a film is like air traffic control, you're locking in all the pieces in order that everything moves forward according to plan.' Angered, but undaunted, Gilliam continued his increasingly complex dance with the European backers. A bridge of $500,000 was provided by London production company, @radical media, who handled Gilliam's rare sorties into commercials. With the Path\u00e9 money still in place, Ren\u00e9 Cleitman from another French company, Hachette Premiere, took over production in August 1999, demanding a new budget and schedule, and promising to have the money in place by the end of November. 'The problem was, Ren\u00e9 would not speak to Sarah Radclyffe, who had loads of knowledge, and was being very gracious even though she was no longer attached to the film.' Soon after, a meeting with Path\u00e9 further stoked Gilliam's now burgeoning frustration with the French way of doing business. 'Suddenly, in the middle of a script meeting, Alexis Lloyd (erstwhile managing director of Path\u00e9 UK) starts talking about money, saying they want the budget brought down to $25m. I got on the phone to the other financiers and started screaming. Canal Plus and Path\u00e9 were so embarrassed, they immediately offered us some money.' Finally, in January 2000, Cleitman proposed a revised budget of \u00a331m. Depp, meanwhile, having finished shooting the Sally Potter part, now had another offer for a much bigger budget movie, entitled Blow. 'We still don't have the right money, the lawyers are taking forever because we've stumbled into a pan-European tax nightmare because the rules are different in every country. Everyone, including myself and the writer, Tony Grisoni, is working for nothing. The process is dragging on interminably and killing the momentum. The only person who is happy is Jean Rochefort who is steadily working away learning English.' It was around this time, Gilliam says, that he 'realised the abyss between Hollywood and France'. To secure a star such as Johnny Depp, it is common, in America at least, to offer what is known as a pay-or-play deal, which ensures that the actor gets paid even if the film is not made. This, according to Gilliam, was anathema to the French, who are suspicious of all things Hollywood. 'They just could not, or would not, understand that without the star, the film does not get made.' British film producer Andrea Calderwood, who then worked as head of production at Path\u00e9, and had fought hard to back Gilliam's vision, concurs: 'I had one French producer say to me, \"It's not for us to commit to Johnny Depp, it's for him to commit to us\".' Calderwood, who was responsible at Path\u00e9 for backing The Claim, an equally ambitious film by British director, Michael Winterbottom [reviewed on page 7], and who was instrumental in securing \u00a32m from Lottery funds for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, pinpoints what is perhaps the key subtext to this salutary story. 'There is a different approach to filmmaking in France. The producer, for instance, can be personally responsible for the finance, and can often bond the film themselves. That obviously affects the producer's relationship towards the film.

      "body": "<p>There is no light so beautiful as that cast by an open fridge into a darkened kitchen. At 3am, even the barest of fridges becomes a treasure chest. Unthinkable pairings become moments of genius. The past-its-sell-by-date becomes the ripe-'n'-ready-to-eat. And that cold, cooked sausage on a saucer suddenly becomes your best friend. If there is one thing I have discovered in all these years of cooking and eating, it is that food tastes much better in your pyjamas. </p> <p>That said, my nocturnal feasting is rare. I know nothing of toss and turn, of counting sheep, of the deep, wretched ache that must be insomnia. I sleep the sleep of the dead. The line about being out before your head touches the pillow is not an exaggeration in my bed. A bad night is the one when I can count 30 seconds between switching out my light and waking up for breakfast. Seasoned insomniacs must already be making their effigies. In Bogota, a terrorist group once blew up the cashpoint machine outside my hotel. My father once leaned over my bed, opened my window and fired a rifle at a burglar. (He missed.) Alarms have shrieked, flatmates have shagged for England and a hurricane once uprooted trees in my garden, yet none of it has seen me lift so much as an eyelid. It is only the shrill siren call of hunger that has the capacity to wake me. </p> <p>My body has never been one to distinguish modest peckishness and life-threatening hunger. It just feels a hole and screams 'Feed me!' so loud I sit bolt upright. A pressing need for midnight munchies shakes me more surely than any burglar, hence my alarm being routed directly through to the police. There is no alarm so loud as that of a rumbling tummy. </p> <p>In the middle of the night it seems a long way down to the solace of the kitchen cupboards. Treacherous, too, when the cat sleeps at the top of the stairs and I have a 3.30 fancy for something-on-toast. The headline will read: 'Cookery writer dies in fridge raid'. Yet there is nothing quite like food to rock you back to sleep, and at that time in the morning - ravenous, unkempt and with no one to see us - we can abandon the rules and our culinary prejudices and eat whatever we think might do the trick. </p> <p>All we are looking for is something to shut up our tummy long enough to get us through till morning. A couple of oatcakes perhaps. Enough milk to make a mug of cocoa. Just one slice of bread for toast. Something bland to send us off again. But no body is going to let us get away with a round of toast once it has spotted a dish of cold crumble or half a tub of taramasalata in the fridge. Stone-cold roast potatoes that should have gone straight in the bin seem the most delectable morsels on earth at 2 o'clock in the morning. </p> <p>You know the scenario. You came down for a cup of herbal tea, but something tells you to look in the fridge. Thoughts of the fragrant steam from a cup of camomile or vervain dissolve instantly at the merest glimpse of a pork-pie wrapper, no matter what time it is. A nice cup of hot-chocolate-drinking-chocolate is no match for that chicken leg poking out from behind the milk carton. No matter that the leg was roasted a week ago and with more garlic than you could shake a stick at. A nice glass of warm milk has no contest against a piece of cold, chewy crackling from the Sunday roast. It is then, with something less than sensible in hand, that you spot the jar of Hellmann's. </p> <p>No midnight fridge raid is complete without a jar of something to dip your edible sleeping pill into. It could be mayonnaise or peanut butter. It could be olive paste. Better still a pot of that chocolate-hazelnut spread stuff that tastes like expensive truffles only better. Anything you have ever believed about good eating goes straight out of the catflap. Have you ever tried dipping celery into Nutella? Well, do. Or what about grissini into a jar of pesto, a carrot into a tub of tomato chutney, or the dry crust from behind the toaster straight into the mayo? </p> <p>The best fridge I ever raided was when I sneaked down the stairs of one of those country-house hotels, the sort with more cushions than customers, where you (don't) write your drinks down at the honesty bar. At least you do write them down. You just forget to mention they were doubles. Not only was there a dish of chicken liver pt\u00e9 (though sadly no toast), a cold roast leg of lamb begging to be carved and an entire Brie de Meaux but, joy of joys, an unattended trifle. You haven't lived till you have eaten trifle in your dressing gown. </p> <p>Theoretically, there are foods that will help to bring on deep, peaceful shuteye. Pasta with cream and cheese, risotto, porridge and milky drinks are all reputed to help, but my personal Mogadon is a round of toast and Marmite. Warm, soft dough of any sort is probably bound to work, but somehow the butter and salty yeast spread seems to work where others have failed. Those in search of a snooze button might also like to try peanut butter on toasted English muffins. </p> <p>The most successful foods for inducing sleep all seem to have some sort of dairy produce in them. A plate of pasta alla Carbonara will have me out like a light. A sloppy risotto with Parmesan and butter or a dish of cauliflower cheese will have me sleeping like a baby before anyone so much as mentions pudding. I have a belief that a mug of Horlicks is just breast-feeding for the elderly. </p> <p>But I am assuming you want something that will send you back to sleep when you may simply want something to take up to bed. I really cannot recommend it. Drink your milk by the light of the fridge and wolf your Ben &amp; Jerry's by the light of the moon. Eat your bacon sandwich at the cooker and your bowl of popcorn on the way up the stairs, but not in the sack. Some things we learn the hard way. I know only too well that eating in bed is a habit fraught with danger, crumbs and the sort of stains that need explaining. </p> <p><strong>A squirrel-store for midnight feasters</strong></p> <p>Peanut butter - smooth, crunchy, or both.</p> <p>Oatcakes - just two and you will be full enough to go straight back to bed.</p> <p>Sardines - you won't even need a can opener.</p> <p>Ready-made meringue shells, aerosol can of 'shaving foam' cream, bar of fine chocolate for melting. The better the chocolate, the less you will notice the soapy taste of the faux cream.</p> <p>Corn for popping - for those who feel the need to get down to some serious cooking at 3am.</p> <p>Grissini - long, slender breadsticks for dipping in anything you fancy. (PS Don't try them in Marmite, they snap.)</p> <p>Pasta, Parmesan and cream - for true insomniacs.</p> <p>Chocolate - your fat-and-sugar childhood favourites will send you to sleep more readily than the good stuff.</p> <p>Herbal teas - vervain (lemon verbena), camomile and lime flower are especially good. And presumably the one marketed as 'Vespers'.</p> <p>Cocoa, Horlicks, Ovaltine - liquid sleeping pills for people who own slippers.</p> <p>Baked beans - though on second thoughts maybe not.</p> <p>Bacon, white plastic bread, tom ketch, HP sauce, etc.</p> <p>Olive pastes - in desperation you could always stick the oatcakes in them.</p> <p>A supply of dried figs and apricots - for those who have rather missed the point.</p> <p><strong>Popcorn</strong></p> <p>The idea of cooking in the middle of the night does not appeal. But for those who find themselves regularly awake in the small hours, then I suggest you get in a pack or two of popcorn. Hot food, suitably soporifric, and as easy as pie. </p> <p><strong>2 or 3 handfuls of popcorn per person</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp vegetable oil</strong></p> <p><strong>butter</strong></p> <p><strong>sea salt</strong></p> <p>Put a heavy-based pan over a low heat - anything thinner will burn - and pour in a scant tablespoon of oil. You want it to be just enough that the kernels don't stick and burn. Add the corn kernels but make certain that they are no deeper than a single layer. Now clap on the lid and let them cook, slowly, until you hear them starting to pop. Shake the pan from time to time - and quite often - once they start popping, otherwise they will burn. Get the butter melting - you will be amazed at how much you will need. Remove the lid on the corn, beware any late poppers, and pour over the butter. Grind salt generously.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is no light so beautiful as that cast by an open fridge into a darkened kitchen. At 3am, even the barest of fridges becomes a treasure chest. Unthinkable pairings become moments of genius. The past-its-sell-by-date becomes the ripe-'n'-ready-to-eat. And that cold, cooked sausage on a saucer suddenly becomes your best friend. If there is one thing I have discovered in all these years of cooking and eating, it is that food tastes much better in your pyjamas. That said, my nocturnal feasting is rare. I know nothing of toss and turn, of counting sheep, of the deep, wretched ache that must be insomnia. I sleep the sleep of the dead. The line about being out before your head touches the pillow is not an exaggeration in my bed. A bad night is the one when I can count 30 seconds between switching out my light and waking up for breakfast. Seasoned insomniacs must already be making their effigies. In Bogota, a terrorist group once blew up the cashpoint machine outside my hotel. My father once leaned over my bed, opened my window and fired a rifle at a burglar. (He missed.) Alarms have shrieked, flatmates have shagged for England and a hurricane once uprooted trees in my garden, yet none of it has seen me lift so much as an eyelid. It is only the shrill siren call of hunger that has the capacity to wake me. My body has never been one to distinguish modest peckishness and life-threatening hunger. It just feels a hole and screams 'Feed me!' so loud I sit bolt upright. A pressing need for midnight munchies shakes me more surely than any burglar, hence my alarm being routed directly through to the police. There is no alarm so loud as that of a rumbling tummy. In the middle of the night it seems a long way down to the solace of the kitchen cupboards. Treacherous, too, when the cat sleeps at the top of the stairs and I have a 3.30 fancy for something-on-toast. The headline will read: 'Cookery writer dies in fridge raid'. Yet there is nothing quite like food to rock you back to sleep, and at that time in the morning - ravenous, unkempt and with no one to see us - we can abandon the rules and our culinary prejudices and eat whatever we think might do the trick. All we are looking for is something to shut up our tummy long enough to get us through till morning. A couple of oatcakes perhaps. Enough milk to make a mug of cocoa. Just one slice of bread for toast. Something bland to send us off again. But no body is going to let us get away with a round of toast once it has spotted a dish of cold crumble or half a tub of taramasalata in the fridge. Stone-cold roast potatoes that should have gone straight in the bin seem the most delectable morsels on earth at 2 o'clock in the morning. You know the scenario. You came down for a cup of herbal tea, but something tells you to look in the fridge. Thoughts of the fragrant steam from a cup of camomile or vervain dissolve instantly at the merest glimpse of a pork-pie wrapper, no matter what time it is. A nice cup of hot-chocolate-drinking-chocolate is no match for that chicken leg poking out from behind the milk carton. No matter that the leg was roasted a week ago and with more garlic than you could shake a stick at. A nice glass of warm milk has no contest against a piece of cold, chewy crackling from the Sunday roast. It is then, with something less than sensible in hand, that you spot the jar of Hellmann's. No midnight fridge raid is complete without a jar of something to dip your edible sleeping pill into. It could be mayonnaise or peanut butter. It could be olive paste. Better still a pot of that chocolate-hazelnut spread stuff that tastes like expensive truffles only better. Anything you have ever believed about good eating goes straight out of the catflap. Have you ever tried dipping celery into Nutella? Well, do. Or what about grissini into a jar of pesto, a carrot into a tub of tomato chutney, or the dry crust from behind the toaster straight into the mayo? The best fridge I ever raided was when I sneaked down the stairs of one of those country-house hotels, the sort with more cushions than customers, where you (don't) write your drinks down at the honesty bar. At least you do write them down. You just forget to mention they were doubles. Not only was there a dish of chicken liver pt\u00e9 (though sadly no toast), a cold roast leg of lamb begging to be carved and an entire Brie de Meaux but, joy of joys, an unattended trifle. You haven't lived till you have eaten trifle in your dressing gown. Theoretically, there are foods that will help to bring on deep, peaceful shuteye. Pasta with cream and cheese, risotto, porridge and milky drinks are all reputed to help, but my personal Mogadon is a round of toast and Marmite. Warm, soft dough of any sort is probably bound to work, but somehow the butter and salty yeast spread seems to work where others have failed. Those in search of a snooze button might also like to try peanut butter on toasted English muffins. The most successful foods for inducing sleep all seem to have some sort of dairy produce in them. A plate of pasta alla Carbonara will have me out like a light. A sloppy risotto with Parmesan and butter or a dish of cauliflower cheese will have me sleeping like a baby before anyone so much as mentions pudding. I have a belief that a mug of Horlicks is just breast-feeding for the elderly. But I am assuming you want something that will send you back to sleep when you may simply want something to take up to bed. I really cannot recommend it. Drink your milk by the light of the fridge and wolf your Ben &amp; Jerry's by the light of the moon. Eat your bacon sandwich at the cooker and your bowl of popcorn on the way up the stairs, but not in the sack. Some things we learn the hard way. I know only too well that eating in bed is a habit fraught with danger, crumbs and the sort of stains that need explaining. A squirrel-store for midnight feasters Peanut butter - smooth, crunchy, or both. Oatcakes - just two and you will be full enough to go straight back to bed. Sardines - you won't even need a can opener. Ready-made meringue shells, aerosol can of 'shaving foam' cream, bar of fine chocolate for melting. The better the chocolate, the less you will notice the soapy taste of the faux cream. Corn for popping - for those who feel the need to get down to some serious cooking at 3am. Grissini - long, slender breadsticks for dipping in anything you fancy. (PS Don't try them in Marmite, they snap.) Pasta, Parmesan and cream - for true insomniacs. Chocolate - your fat-and-sugar childhood favourites will send you to sleep more readily than the good stuff. Herbal teas - vervain (lemon verbena), camomile and lime flower are especially good. And presumably the one marketed as 'Vespers'. Cocoa, Horlicks, Ovaltine - liquid sleeping pills for people who own slippers. Baked beans - though on second thoughts maybe not. Bacon, white plastic bread, tom ketch, HP sauce, etc. Olive pastes - in desperation you could always stick the oatcakes in them. A supply of dried figs and apricots - for those who have rather missed the point. Popcorn The idea of cooking in the middle of the night does not appeal. But for those who find themselves regularly awake in the small hours, then I suggest you get in a pack or two of popcorn. Hot food, suitably soporifric, and as easy as pie. 2 or 3 handfuls of popcorn per person 1 tbsp vegetable oil butter sea salt Put a heavy-based pan over a low heat - anything thinner will burn - and pour in a scant tablespoon of oil. You want it to be just enough that the kernels don't stick and burn. Add the corn kernels but make certain that they are no deeper than a single layer. Now clap on the lid and let them cook, slowly, until you hear them starting to pop. Shake the pan from time to time - and quite often - once they start popping, otherwise they will burn. Get the butter melting - you will be amazed at how much you will need. Remove the lid on the corn, beware any late poppers, and pour over the butter. Grind salt generously.",

Rain drops carry love into the world, they wash out the things that are hurting the earth, but mostly, they carry love into the earth, and makes the love sweat, upon everybody's body, like water, dripping on flowers.

      "body": "<p>It is snowing. The flakes stream into the torchlight like a crowd flowing across a bridge, each one unknowably different, all exactly the same. But look up and the snow piles out of the dark like a weightless waterfall, tumbling from a black nowhere to your face, that twig, this jut of brick, every exact where. Snow at night is like the roof falling in, quietly. I suppose that the quiet is as much the essence of my garden at night as the lack of light, and that is one of the privileges of living here out in the sticks. Another person's nocturnal weather is accompanied by a soundtrack of traffic roar, people noisily doing what night people do, trains or planes. Our silence is complete for moments at a time and I have always felt compelled to move at night silently, carefully, aware that the space I fill is a clumsy intrusion. And our dark is measured by the moon and stars and their relative obscurity, not by streetlamps, shop lights or headlights. The effect of this, with its stillness and its view into the vast mass of the universe, is to make the garden at night a fine and private place.</p> <p>I have always loved my nightly walk round the garden, even in weather a lot less romantic than snow or frost. Which is just as well, given that it is normally not snow cutting through the torchlight but rain and more rain. The lack of light puts a fresh face on the place. The garden is simplified, but not reduced. The good bits are coloured by memory and the bad bits smudged out. In fact, although we do sometimes have complete silence (but not often, of which more anon) we never have complete dark. The moon figures a lot and I am always aware of its stages, from the shiniest fingernail rim in the late afternoon to a full, fat orange harvest moon in September. Talking of which, we had the most marvellous exhibition of the full lunar eclipse the other day in a completely clear sky. It had the effect of not just making the moon a russet colour but of giving it more dimension, so that for an hour or so it was an amber ball in the sky rather than its usual disc-like self. </p> <p>I have tried to become knowledgeable about lunar planting and have read various books prescribing, down to the very day, what to put in the ground according to the phases; but it seems that there is something a little mechanic and unsubtle about this. It reminds me of feng shui, which, although based upon common sense and intuition, is undoubtedly a load of old rubbish as soon as it becomes a marketable creed. You need the irrational, harassed, all-too-human element to make gardens come alive, and that invariably means putting the beans in when the moon is on the wane (or vice versa) just when the book says that on no account plant legumes until the moon is waxing (or vice versa). The lunar flow to go with is inside your veins, not a book - and if you spend 10 minutes or so outside in your garden every night you will soon tune in. </p> <p>It must be outside, of course - looking through the window is cheating. You need the wind. You need the rain.</p> <p>I take the stars for granted because, when there are no clouds, they are always there - masses of them, billowing and shifting like a blizzard. I am no astronomer but I can edge my way round the sky, finding the Plough and, from there, the Pole Star, locating the square of Pegasus and working up to the only galaxy visible to the naked eye (and that only if you look away and catch it shimmering right at the edge of vision). When I was thinking about this article, I realised that the night sky belongs almost entirely to my garden. I hardly ever come across it anywhere else. I take it on trust that other people have access to it, too, but for all its billions of miles and galaxies and planets and moons, it is as local and personal as this year's crop of beans or the knobbly outline on the pruned limes. </p> <p>I mentioned that we have total silence from time to time, but perhaps only for a minute or two a week. In modern life, that is quite a lot, but for most of the time the garden is busy with noise at night. The loudest and most shocking is the scream of the vixen at this time of year, looking for her mate. Nothing is more bloodcurdling or inhuman than that. Part of me loves to hear it because it is a privilege to have foxes prowling around at night; but another part immediately does a mental check to see if I have locked up the hens. No doubt it will become a thing of the past if the absurd anti-hunting bill goes through and all the country foxes are wiped out by gun and gas, as surely they will be - in the countryside at least. </p> <p>We have tawny owls and little owls, although the latter make most noise at dusk and dawn. In our last house and garden there was a large orchard rising on a slope immediately behind the house. One year an owl and had two young that stayed within the orchard after they had left the nest. As they grew, they tested their voices more and more, answering each other hoot for hoot. By the end of August they were getting good at it and would scream and blare for hours at a time with astonishing volume, just a few yards from our bedroom window. The memory is a treasure but the experience was notably devoid of sleep.</p> <p>In a week or two, the first curlews will come back and start their fluting warbling call before it gets light. As we go into March and April, this carries on almost through the night and day, and is perhaps the best, most haunting bird sound that there is. When I was a student, my father made me a tape of the dawn chorus in early March, standing in his garden at 6am with primitive tape recorder, and sent it to me. I could only bear to listen to it once. </p> <p>It was a heartbreaking, deeply disturbing sound, like glimpsing someone you love passing on a train. The robin, blackbird and thrush slowly breaking the dark and going insane with song as the dawn rose. Now I would rather lose sleep than miss any of it at all.</p> <p>I have to admit one thing that I hate about night: bats. The only tolerable bat is a dead one and I would willingly cause all bats in the UK to die today of a mysterious disease. I know this sort of thing provokes flurries of outraged letters, but save your ink because this is a deep-seated irrational loathing based upon fear and not open to any reason. I know that bats eat thousands of noxious insects in every garden and I know they do no known harm, but that kind of knowledge is not enough.

      "bodyText": "It is snowing. The flakes stream into the torchlight like a crowd flowing across a bridge, each one unknowably different, all exactly the same. But look up and the snow piles out of the dark like a weightless waterfall, tumbling from a black nowhere to your face, that twig, this jut of brick, every exact where. Snow at night is like the roof falling in, quietly. I suppose that the quiet is as much the essence of my garden at night as the lack of light, and that is one of the privileges of living here out in the sticks. Another person's nocturnal weather is accompanied by a soundtrack of traffic roar, people noisily doing what night people do, trains or planes. Our silence is complete for moments at a time and I have always felt compelled to move at night silently, carefully, aware that the space I fill is a clumsy intrusion. And our dark is measured by the moon and stars and their relative obscurity, not by streetlamps, shop lights or headlights. The effect of this, with its stillness and its view into the vast mass of the universe, is to make the garden at night a fine and private place. I have always loved my nightly walk round the garden, even in weather a lot less romantic than snow or frost. Which is just as well, given that it is normally not snow cutting through the torchlight but rain and more rain. The lack of light puts a fresh face on the place. The garden is simplified, but not reduced. The good bits are coloured by memory and the bad bits smudged out. In fact, although we do sometimes have complete silence (but not often, of which more anon) we never have complete dark. The moon figures a lot and I am always aware of its stages, from the shiniest fingernail rim in the late afternoon to a full, fat orange harvest moon in September. Talking of which, we had the most marvellous exhibition of the full lunar eclipse the other day in a completely clear sky. It had the effect of not just making the moon a russet colour but of giving it more dimension, so that for an hour or so it was an amber ball in the sky rather than its usual disc-like self. I have tried to become knowledgeable about lunar planting and have read various books prescribing, down to the very day, what to put in the ground according to the phases; but it seems that there is something a little mechanic and unsubtle about this. It reminds me of feng shui, which, although based upon common sense and intuition, is undoubtedly a load of old rubbish as soon as it becomes a marketable creed. You need the irrational, harassed, all-too-human element to make gardens come alive, and that invariably means putting the beans in when the moon is on the wane (or vice versa) just when the book says that on no account plant legumes until the moon is waxing (or vice versa). The lunar flow to go with is inside your veins, not a book - and if you spend 10 minutes or so outside in your garden every night you will soon tune in. It must be outside, of course - looking through the window is cheating. You need the wind. You need the rain. I take the stars for granted because, when there are no clouds, they are always there - masses of them, billowing and shifting like a blizzard. I am no astronomer but I can edge my way round the sky, finding the Plough and, from there, the Pole Star, locating the square of Pegasus and working up to the only galaxy visible to the naked eye (and that only if you look away and catch it shimmering right at the edge of vision). When I was thinking about this article, I realised that the night sky belongs almost entirely to my garden. I hardly ever come across it anywhere else. I take it on trust that other people have access to it, too, but for all its billions of miles and galaxies and planets and moons, it is as local and personal as this year's crop of beans or the knobbly outline on the pruned limes. I mentioned that we have total silence from time to time, but perhaps only for a minute or two a week. In modern life, that is quite a lot, but for most of the time the garden is busy with noise at night. The loudest and most shocking is the scream of the vixen at this time of year, looking for her mate. Nothing is more bloodcurdling or inhuman than that. Part of me loves to hear it because it is a privilege to have foxes prowling around at night; but another part immediately does a mental check to see if I have locked up the hens. No doubt it will become a thing of the past if the absurd anti-hunting bill goes through and all the country foxes are wiped out by gun and gas, as surely they will be - in the countryside at least. We have tawny owls and little owls, although the latter make most noise at dusk and dawn. In our last house and garden there was a large orchard rising on a slope immediately behind the house. One year an owl and had two young that stayed within the orchard after they had left the nest. As they grew, they tested their voices more and more, answering each other hoot for hoot. By the end of August they were getting good at it and would scream and blare for hours at a time with astonishing volume, just a few yards from our bedroom window. The memory is a treasure but the experience was notably devoid of sleep. In a week or two, the first curlews will come back and start their fluting warbling call before it gets light. As we go into March and April, this carries on almost through the night and day, and is perhaps the best, most haunting bird sound that there is. When I was a student, my father made me a tape of the dawn chorus in early March, standing in his garden at 6am with primitive tape recorder, and sent it to me. I could only bear to listen to it once. It was a heartbreaking, deeply disturbing sound, like glimpsing someone you love passing on a train. The robin, blackbird and thrush slowly breaking the dark and going insane with song as the dawn rose. Now I would rather lose sleep than miss any of it at all. I have to admit one thing that I hate about night: bats. The only tolerable bat is a dead one and I would willingly cause all bats in the UK to die today of a mysterious disease. I know this sort of thing provokes flurries of outraged letters, but save your ink because this is a deep-seated irrational loathing based upon fear and not open to any reason. I know that bats eat thousands of noxious insects in every garden and I know they do no known harm, but that kind of knowledge is not enough. They literally make my flesh creep and a bat in the house is my yardstick of hell. From April to October they bombard me as I work or walk in the garden at dusk and only will power makes me do it night after summer night. I think I hate them most for making me feel so frightened, along with the knowledge that the fear is unreasonable so therefore cannot be reasoned away. I suppose I am frightened of something else and they are the unbreakable link to that thing - and I shall never know what it is. A bad dream.

      "body": "<p>My husband and I have a son, who we adopted from America. About him you need know nothing more save that he is gorgeous and we love him very much. His confidentiality is paramount and, whatever the public hunger for intimate detail, we are not about to parade our bundle of joy, unlike the Kilshaws of North Wales. Instead, this is about the adoption process though which our son came to be with us and which, to our minds, represents the very best of America, as against the route of the Kilshaws, which represents the very worst. </p> <p>Yes, money does change hands and, yes, the internet can be involved. But those bald facts hide the detail of an adoption process which, when it works, is a thing of beauty and from which Britain could learn an awful lot. Our fear is that the attention the Kilshaws' grotesque adventures have received will jeopardise any future adoptions from America. Worse, it could stigmatise any children already adopted here. </p> <p>We went through a non-profit-making adoption agency in a Midwest US state. From the very start, their requirements were no different from those in this country: under state law, we had to be subject to an in-depth home study by a reputable organisation. Ours was carried out by a British charity in the child welfare field, working as proxy for our local authority, who had final approval on our suitability. </p> <p>It is standard for adoptive parents to whinge about the home study process, to complain that it is too long, too arbitrary, too intrusive. To be honest, at times it was a complete pain, but it was necessary. Why should anybody wanting to get involved in adoption not be given the once, twice, thrice over? </p> <p>With the US agency we used, prospective adoptive parents are asked to compose a three-page letter describing themselves and why they want to adopt; we had never before faced a more difficult writing job. Along with a photograph, the pages were to be shown to pregnant mothers who had decided, after a lengthy period of counselling, that they wanted to place their child for adoption when it is born. From those few pages, our stab at a comprehensive declaration of intent, they would decide whether we were the ones to parent their child. We agonised for days over our essay, until eventually we realised that the only thing we could do was be ourselves. </p> <p>And it worked. One day, we received a call - we had been chosen. This part of the process is key. Adopted children have described feelings of insecurity which stemmed from a sense that, having been chosen by their adoptive parents, they can somehow be unchosen if they are 'bad'; that they are there purely at the whim of their carers. Imagine, say, if you had been adopted as the result solely of a pixilated image placed on the web? Is that any way to begin a life? </p> <p>Through this system, the sense of being randomly 'picked' is banished. To some degree, it can also help deal with the older adopted child's often quoted belief that their birth mother simply abandoned them at birth. At least here is a narrative of sorts; a plan has been made, decisions have been taken. Most importantly, birth parents have taken a part in the process. </p> <p>What's more, it's an ongoing process. Birth and adoptive parents are encouraged to make contact and build up a dialogue in the few weeks that are left before the child is born. Our son's birth parents suggested we use web-based email accounts, both anonymous and untraceable. We agreed and for three weeks we exchanged messages through the ether as we carefully felt each other out in an attempt to discover what kind of people we were. We needed to learn to trust each other. All being well, this relationship would last a lifetime. This, it should be said, is the only part the internet played in our story. </p> <p>Normally, prospective adoptive parents get a call from the agency when the birth mother goes into labour. We knew before then, courtesy of an email from our son's birth mother as her contractions began. We had no option but to buy our plane tickets and go, with no sense of what lay at the other end. In the US state we went through, birth parents cannot sign away the rights to their child until 72 hours after birth, though they are not required to do so at that point. Indeed, birth parents can and do change their minds after the birth and choose to keep the child, and they have every right to do so; it would be hard to argue that this would be anything other than a good outcome. We simply had to travel with that uncertainty, but it was one for which we were prepared. </p> <p>Once the birth parents' decision is taken, however, there is no going back. The adoption agency is given custody of the child and then places it with the chosen parents. Once a month for the first six months, the child and adoptive parents will receive home visits to check the arrangement is working out. Only then will the adoption be finalised. </p> <p>But even now contact does not stop. Adoptive parents are required, by the agency's terms, to send a letter and photograph of the child to the agency once a month for the first year.

      "bodyText": "My husband and I have a son, who we adopted from America. About him you need know nothing more save that he is gorgeous and we love him very much. His confidentiality is paramount and, whatever the public hunger for intimate detail, we are not about to parade our bundle of joy, unlike the Kilshaws of North Wales. Instead, this is about the adoption process though which our son came to be with us and which, to our minds, represents the very best of America, as against the route of the Kilshaws, which represents the very worst. Yes, money does change hands and, yes, the internet can be involved. But those bald facts hide the detail of an adoption process which, when it works, is a thing of beauty and from which Britain could learn an awful lot. Our fear is that the attention the Kilshaws' grotesque adventures have received will jeopardise any future adoptions from America. Worse, it could stigmatise any children already adopted here. We went through a non-profit-making adoption agency in a Midwest US state. From the very start, their requirements were no different from those in this country: under state law, we had to be subject to an in-depth home study by a reputable organisation. Ours was carried out by a British charity in the child welfare field, working as proxy for our local authority, who had final approval on our suitability. It is standard for adoptive parents to whinge about the home study process, to complain that it is too long, too arbitrary, too intrusive. To be honest, at times it was a complete pain, but it was necessary. Why should anybody wanting to get involved in adoption not be given the once, twice, thrice over? With the US agency we used, prospective adoptive parents are asked to compose a three-page letter describing themselves and why they want to adopt; we had never before faced a more difficult writing job. Along with a photograph, the pages were to be shown to pregnant mothers who had decided, after a lengthy period of counselling, that they wanted to place their child for adoption when it is born. From those few pages, our stab at a comprehensive declaration of intent, they would decide whether we were the ones to parent their child. We agonised for days over our essay, until eventually we realised that the only thing we could do was be ourselves. And it worked. One day, we received a call - we had been chosen. This part of the process is key. Adopted children have described feelings of insecurity which stemmed from a sense that, having been chosen by their adoptive parents, they can somehow be unchosen if they are 'bad'; that they are there purely at the whim of their carers. Imagine, say, if you had been adopted as the result solely of a pixilated image placed on the web? Is that any way to begin a life? Through this system, the sense of being randomly 'picked' is banished. To some degree, it can also help deal with the older adopted child's often quoted belief that their birth mother simply abandoned them at birth. At least here is a narrative of sorts; a plan has been made, decisions have been taken. Most importantly, birth parents have taken a part in the process. What's more, it's an ongoing process. Birth and adoptive parents are encouraged to make contact and build up a dialogue in the few weeks that are left before the child is born. Our son's birth parents suggested we use web-based email accounts, both anonymous and untraceable. We agreed and for three weeks we exchanged messages through the ether as we carefully felt each other out in an attempt to discover what kind of people we were. We needed to learn to trust each other. All being well, this relationship would last a lifetime. This, it should be said, is the only part the internet played in our story. Normally, prospective adoptive parents get a call from the agency when the birth mother goes into labour. We knew before then, courtesy of an email from our son's birth mother as her contractions began. We had no option but to buy our plane tickets and go, with no sense of what lay at the other end. In the US state we went through, birth parents cannot sign away the rights to their child until 72 hours after birth, though they are not required to do so at that point. Indeed, birth parents can and do change their minds after the birth and choose to keep the child, and they have every right to do so; it would be hard to argue that this would be anything other than a good outcome. We simply had to travel with that uncertainty, but it was one for which we were prepared. Once the birth parents' decision is taken, however, there is no going back. The adoption agency is given custody of the child and then places it with the chosen parents. Once a month for the first six months, the child and adoptive parents will receive home visits to check the arrangement is working out. Only then will the adoption be finalised. But even now contact does not stop. Adoptive parents are required, by the agency's terms, to send a letter and photograph of the child to the agency once a month for the first year. The birth parents don't have to collect them but they are there if ever they wish to. After that first year, what happens is up to both sides, though many families keep up regular letters for years, smoothing the way for if and when the child and birth parents re-establish contact. For us, it made absolute sense. Many people with little experience of adoption see birth parents as the spectres at the feast, the unknown quantity whom they fear will wade in at some point and demand back what once was theirs. It doesn't have to be that way. Birth parents are an adopted child's genetic heritage and more. They are the beginning of the story and, for the child's sake, they need to be available for when and if that moment comes. It is not a feckless decision to place your child for adoption. So what about the bottom line? Well yes, in the land of the free, very little is, and no one should pretend otherwise. Adoptive parents are liable for both legal costs and the medical costs of the birth, though no birth mother would be coun selled to place their child for adoption simply because they could not afford the hospital fees.

      "body": "<p>It was how her life was meant to be, but not how it turned out. For nine years, Kathy Blackburn tried a succession of six different fertility treatments, never taking holidays, only working as a temp so she would have flexibility to make hospital appointments. </p> <p>She even tried superstition: she bought Babygros and slept with them under her pillow. Then, aged 30, Kathy made the decision she had been desperately trying to avoid: to give up trying and accept she would never have a baby. </p> <p>'I grew up with the fairy tale that you get married and have children and live happily ever after, and when that doesn't happen, you think: who am I?', she said. Her marriage failed, she had a breakdown, she felt suicidal. 'I found myself in my car with my foot down thinking I don't give a toss. I lost the plot. I felt so isolated,' said Kathy, 33, who now has a new partner and a full-time job. </p> <p>Kathy is among the one in six adults who has problems with fertility, which affects men and women equally. Despite all the advances in fertility treatments, many remain unable to have any children of their own. There are few reliable figures, but it is thought around one in 10 couples is childless involuntarily. Many suffer depression, and one in five considers suicide. One in three of such couples breaks up, blaming childlessness as the cause. </p> <p>Tomorrow the first British charity aimed at helping the involuntary childless, MoreToLife, is officially launched. </p> <p>'There's been no support for people who have not being going through treatment. The biggest problem of involuntary childlessness is loneliness and isolation,' said Joe Thompson, national co-ordinator of MoreToLife, which has set up support groups in all parts of the country. He added: 'One of the first things people want to talk about is, quite simply, the meaning of life.' </p> <p>Until now, despite the multitude of groups prepared to help couples through fertility treatment, there was nobody around once couples decided to stop trying. </p> <p>Involuntary childlessness is a problem that stalks people before they even know they are set to suffer it. After having treatment comes the even more painful decision to stop having it. </p> <p>Kathy and her husband unsuccessfully tried to have a baby for a year before they sought help. The first effort involved artificial insemination by her husband, which they tried monthly over a year. Doctors then found he was producing poor sperm and put him on steroids. When that didn't work, they tried in vitro fertilisation (IVF) - the treatment to produce 'test-tube' babies. That, too, was doomed to failure. </p> <p>'Every time I failed, I said I'm not going to do it again, and I always did. You fall in love with the idea of having children,' said Kathy, who lives outside Norwich. 'You get very hurt and angry. It's like being on an emotional roller-coaster. You're upset anyway and they pump you full of hormones that make it far worse. Sex became just sex, making love was out the window.' </p> <p>After the failure to conceive with her husband's sperm, she tried artificial insemination from a donor. She then discovered she had dysfunctional ovaries, and the doctors tried a new technique injecting the sperm as high up the uterus as possible, a process she went through six times. Finally they tried a new technique, ICSI, where the sperm was injected straight into one of her eggs. It did not work. </p> <p>'Then I decided I couldn't take any more,' she said. 'I'd fought for funding, I fought for treatment, but then I was the one who had given up. I regret how much it took over my life. I should have said five years is enough, but with new treatments constantly developed you always think there's something else you can do, or another doctor who can make a difference.' </p> <p>Even for those who have not endured Kathy's experience, the decision to give up can be heart-breaking, and the regrets just as strong. Suzanne, who did not want to give her real name, spent thousands of pounds trying IVF treatment twice. 'You go for a scan and are told everything's fine, and you're on a high, and then you go along and you're told it doesn't work. Every month is a cycle of hope and despair. It becomes an obsession, it's all you can think about. You think let's not book a holiday, maybe I'll be pregnant,' she said. </p> <p>'It was one of the hardest decisions in my life to stop. You have to realise you can't have everything you want in life. I always thought as soon as I wanted a child it would happen. It came as a shock. Having a child is a gift,' she said. </p> <p>For Suzanne, a teacher, the regrets are not that she tried for so long, but that she left it so late. 'I was 37, I had put my career first. I think, if only I hadn't been so career-minded.' </p> <p>Failing at fertility treatment is far from rare. Although IVF in particular is often seen as a miracle cure, it has a low success rate. There are some clinics with only a 5 per cent chance of success per cycle; the most successful clinic, in London, has a success rate of 40 per cent. Overall, about half of those who try fertility treatment will be successful, with an average of three attempts. In some parts of the country the NHS will pay, in others recipients must produce \u00a33,000 for each attempt. Some people have ended up mortgaging their houses to pay for th treatment. 'Stopping is difficult because you have to come to terms not only that you will have no children, but the fact that you have wasted three years of your life trying, and wasted \u00a310,000 for nothing,' said Phil Holm, director of Issue, the national fertility charity. </p> <p>But even once the decision has been made, the involuntary childless have to come to terms with the fact they failed to have children, they will never have them and with the bitter reality that most of their friends do. </p> <p>'It destroyed my marriage. Being part of my marriage was being part of a failed situation,' said Kathy. Sex remained difficult. 'Having sex is a reminder of not being able to conceive, it put me off for a while.' </p> <p>Even sustaining friendships became a chore. 'Everyone else was going for a Chinese takeaway and \"bang!\" a month later they're pregnant. You get very envious. You're not part of the conversations. They don't know what to say to me, and I don't know what to say to them. I have lost friends on the way.' </p> <p>Then even mundane daily life can become cruel. If you want children and know you can't have them, things other people don't even notice become a source of pain. </p> <p>'There's always two aisles in the supermarket you never get to go down. There's always a special part in the supermarket for mums with babies. They're part of an exclusive club. Buying things for other people's children is very hard. I find it very hard to watch people breastfeed,' said Kathy. 'Christmas, which is so based around children, is particularly hard.' </p> <p>Popular culture doesn't help. Babies are now high fashion with pop stars and actors delighting in parading their charges across the pages of glossy mag azines and newspapers. Images of David and Victoria Beckham, Madonna and Guy Ritchie, add to the anguish for those who will never be parents. </p> <p>For some, the isolation is deepened by the fact that being involuntarily childless is largely a taboo subject. Many couples report feeling that they have to pretend they didn't actually want children. </p> <p>Anthony Bertram, who runs a company supplying knives to London restaurants, spent four years trying for babies with his wife Carolyn, but an endless round of medical tests showed he was azoospermic, producing no sperm at all. </p> <p>'It was immensely difficult. We're normal people - we saw our lives in terms of weddings, children, and funerals, and you have to reassess what you are all about. You start asking why you are here,' he said. 'It affects your self-esteem no end. But you are here for lots of reasons, there are many ways you can contribute - I run a family business.' </p> <p>Some involuntary childless set out to find new meaning by doing new work. Kathy now has a full-time job in Anglia Water, and has worked hard to prove herself. 'I substituted my failure at having a family to being bloody good at work.' </p> <p>Others take up new activities in their spare time. 'I thought my life would be meaningless without them. Now I see I do have a purpose in life, even without children. I have to remind myself I am just as worthy as anyone else,' said Suzanne. </p> <p>Already a teacher, she now does extra voluntary work with children. Her husband has developed an absorbing sideline as an artist. 'If I can't have what I want, I have to look elsewhere to fulfil my maternal instincts - I work with children and have cats,' she said. </p> <p>There are also positive aspects to being childless - and not just in saving money. Many people deliberately chose to have no babies. 'On Sunday mornings, you don't have to get up. You do what you want to do, you have holidays when you want. I have a big motorbike - that's my toy,' said Anthony. </p> <p>Eventually, life returns to a more even keel. 'I've got my life back now; I've got stability. I've gone from someone who was trying to have a child to someone who could never have one,' said Kathy. When people ask her if she has children, she doesn't say she doesn't have any, but 'I can't have any'. </p> <p>'I'm more at peace now,' said Suzanne - although she's still wary of the future. 'It'll be difficult when my friends are grandparents and have grandchildren running around. At least I have a nephew and nieces, but it'll be difficult.' </p> <p><strong>The quest for parenthood</strong></p> <p>\u0095 One in six people is affected by infertility at some point of his or her life </p> <p>\u0095 The problem lies with the man's fertility a third of the time, the woman's a third of the time, and a combination about 20 per cent of the time.

'If I can't have what I want, I have to look elsewhere to fulfil my maternal instincts - I work with children and have cats,' she said. There are also positive aspects to being childless - and not just in saving money. Many people deliberately chose to have no babies. 'On Sunday mornings, you don't have to get up. You do what you want to do, you have holidays when you want. I have a big motorbike - that's my toy,' said Anthony. Eventually, life returns to a more even keel. 'I've got my life back now; I've got stability. I've gone from someone who was trying to have a child to someone who could never have one,' said Kathy. When people ask her if she has children, she doesn't say she doesn't have any, but 'I can't have any'. 'I'm more at peace now,' said Suzanne - although she's still wary of the future. 'It'll be difficult when my friends are grandparents and have grandchildren running around. At least I have a nephew and nieces, but it'll be difficult.' The quest for parenthood \u0095 One in six people is affected by infertility at some point of his or her life \u0095 The problem lies with the man's fertility a third of the time, the woman's a third of the time, and a combination about 20 per cent of the time. In about 10 per cent of cases, the cause of infertility is unknown \u0095 Almost 30,000 couples receive fertility treatment each year in Britain, an increase of 55 per cent in the last five years \u0095 One in 80 children is conceived with medical help \u0095 On average, those going through fertility treatment make three attempts before being successful or giving up \u0095 About half of those going through fertility treatment are unsuccessful \u0095 About one in 10 couples are involuntarily childless \u0095 One in three involuntarily childless couples break down \u0095 One in five involuntarily childless couples consider suicide",

Van Velzen, as portrayed in the media, more resembles a dodgy doctor of Elizabethan times - a practitioner of sapientia prisca, the ancient wisdom based on the occult.

But neither does it quite explain the Health Secretary's demonisation of van Velzen - a symbol of 'gruesome' and 'grotesque' events evoking Gothic tragedy. Perhaps Mr Milburn thought that tremulous horror would play well with an electorate which is not, by and large, in favour of pickling babies. If so, he miscalculated.

Any time now, the Kennedy report into the Bristol children's heart deaths disaster is due to reach Milburn's desk. The largest ever independent investigation into clinical practice in the NHS has already been unaccountably delayed. There is still no word of its progress or its findings, except that Professor Ian Kennedy is likely to discard the lone villains thesis and focus on the broad systems failures linked to James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana. Given Milburn's messianic stance on patient power, you might imagine that he would be desperate to release the Bristol findings. But perhaps not.</p> <p> The whisper from the royal colleges is that if the Kennedy report is not delivered soon, it may conveniently smoulder in the Ministerial in-tray until after the election, thus sparing Milburn the necessity of confronting the problems of an NHS plunged into deepening gloom. </p> <p>Doctors, it seems, are the new teachers; members of a profession which once put up with the rigours of the job partly because society esteemed them. These days, cat-stranglers boast a higher status. Beware your amiable GP, lest he turn out to be homicidal or incompetent. Mistrust your surgeon, a vainglorious conflation of the Emperor Napoleon and Sir Lancelot Spratt. Never hand over a scrap of tissue from your dear departed, unless doctors sign a contract elaborate enough to cover the purchase of the Dome. The latest doctor-bashing, as administered by Milburn, was a precise echo of the attack a fortnight ago by Sir Donald Irvine, the GMC president. </p> <p>According to Irvine, the flawed and secretive culture of the NHS allows 'paternalism' and poor medical practice to go unchallenged. This is a bit rich, given that the GMC is the dernier cri in self-protection, obfuscation and dilatory treatment of the miscreants it is supposed to police. Irvine's tirade, designed to encourage consensus, instead united the British Medical Association and the medical royal colleges in a scornful denunciation. Doctors want the council halved to 50 members, with an executive, weighted towards lay people, of about a dozen. If Irvine cannot oblige, then Milburn should scrap the GMC and think up a better structure, for the sake of patients who must get the 'balance of power' skewed their way. </p> <p>Milburn is a curious patients' champion, who, so far, has abolished community health councils and installed weaker patients' advocates. The suspicion is that avenues for legitimate complaint are being closed, while patients are being encouraged, rashly, to be as strident as they wish. But, as Alder Hey has proved, patient power is hardly the Delphic oracle. Patients want medical progress but would quite like it to be achieved without the use of dead humans or live animals. They want kidney transplants but recoil at the thought of selling superfluous thymus glands used in anti-rejection research to pharmaceutical companies. Given the poverty of hospitals and the outrageous profits of drugs firms, the only scandal seems to me the nominal price of \u00a310 a sample. </p> <p>Our odd attitude to morbidity and death is supposedly rooted in the veneration an irreligious society accords to the body rather than the soul, but that cannot be right. Church burials are a model of corporeal respect, whereas secular cremations involve only a conveyor-belt ride through Dralon curtains to the incinerator as the piped Bach plays. It seems more likely that our horror of death is rooted in an age of spurious immortality, where those who swallow their vitamins, do their Pilates, count their calories and get their Botox jabs may dream of frozen youth and deferred death, if not quite of eternal life. </p> <p>Hence the absurd fuss about bodies dumped in a hospital chapel and stripped of 'dignity', a commodity that never attaches to the dead and, in hospital, rarely to the living.

And it has a prize bigger than Who Wants to be a Millionaire? - instant celebrity. </p> <p>Last night Popstars became ITV's biggest entertainment hit of the year, attracting an audience to rival Big Brother, Castaway, and Airport. More than 10 million viewers watched Nigel Lythgoe, head of entertainment at London Weekend Television, and his two fellow judges announce which of the 3,000 wannabes who auditioned in an open talent contest for new pop stars had won the prize of a \u00a31 million recording contract. </p> <p>The five, who will form a band and release a single and album this spring, are Danny Foster, 21, from London; Kym Marsh, 24, from Wigan; Myleene Klass, 22, from Norfolk; Noel Sullivan, 20, from Cardiff; and Suzanne Shaw, 19, from Bury in Lancashire. They were chosen from a final short list of 10, drawn from the thousands of 18-24-year-olds who auditioned last year in London, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff. </p> <p>Viewers held Popstars parties around the country to watch Lythgoe, Paul Adam of Polydor records, and Nicki Chapman, manager of teen star Billie Piper, break the news to the final 10. The winning five burst into tears while the losers did their best not to. </p> <p>The documentary-style entertainment series, which began three weeks ago, is the biggest 'reality TV' hit since Big Brother. It took off when 'Nasty Nigel' Lythgoe was filmed dismissing talentless hopefuls with memorable put-downs. He told off-key contestants 'I'm sure the tune was in there somewhere', and 'Sing like Michael Ball? You sing more like Bobby Ball.' </p> <p>Others were told that if they thought they could sing they were 'either deaf or stupid'. </p> <p>Although most contestants got their five minutes of shame, rather than fame, observers say the talent and youthful naivety of the successful few singled out the show as better than the average fly-on-the-wall docusoap. 'The key difference between Popstars and other reality TV shows like Big Brother is that it makes stars of ordinary people who have true star potential, rather than ordinary people who look good on TV for a few weeks but have no shelf-life beyond the show itself,' one ITV insider said. </p> <p>'Unlike the stars of Big Brother, the five popstars - and the five finalists who did not make it through - will enjoy success when the series ends. Popstars is about talent, not just notoriety.' </p> <p>The five successful contestants are currently living together in a secret location.

      "bodyText": "It's the ultimate addictive TV show, combining the voyeurism of Big Brother, the sadism of The Weakest Link, and the talent show appeal of Stars in Their Eyes. And it has a prize bigger than Who Wants to be a Millionaire? - instant celebrity. Last night Popstars became ITV's biggest entertainment hit of the year, attracting an audience to rival Big Brother, Castaway, and Airport. More than 10 million viewers watched Nigel Lythgoe, head of entertainment at London Weekend Television, and his two fellow judges announce which of the 3,000 wannabes who auditioned in an open talent contest for new pop stars had won the prize of a \u00a31 million recording contract. The five, who will form a band and release a single and album this spring, are Danny Foster, 21, from London; Kym Marsh, 24, from Wigan; Myleene Klass, 22, from Norfolk; Noel Sullivan, 20, from Cardiff; and Suzanne Shaw, 19, from Bury in Lancashire. They were chosen from a final short list of 10, drawn from the thousands of 18-24-year-olds who auditioned last year in London, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff. Viewers held Popstars parties around the country to watch Lythgoe, Paul Adam of Polydor records, and Nicki Chapman, manager of teen star Billie Piper, break the news to the final 10. The winning five burst into tears while the losers did their best not to. The documentary-style entertainment series, which began three weeks ago, is the biggest 'reality TV' hit since Big Brother. It took off when 'Nasty Nigel' Lythgoe was filmed dismissing talentless hopefuls with memorable put-downs. He told off-key contestants 'I'm sure the tune was in there somewhere', and 'Sing like Michael Ball? You sing more like Bobby Ball.' Others were told that if they thought they could sing they were 'either deaf or stupid'. Although most contestants got their five minutes of shame, rather than fame, observers say the talent and youthful naivety of the successful few singled out the show as better than the average fly-on-the-wall docusoap. 'The key difference between Popstars and other reality TV shows like Big Brother is that it makes stars of ordinary people who have true star potential, rather than ordinary people who look good on TV for a few weeks but have no shelf-life beyond the show itself,' one ITV insider said. 'Unlike the stars of Big Brother, the five popstars - and the five finalists who did not make it through - will enjoy success when the series ends. Popstars is about talent, not just notoriety.' The five successful contestants are currently living together in a secret location. They are being groomed by leading choreographers, stylists, writers, and producers, including Ray Hedges, the man behind Irish boy-band Boyzone. Bookmakers have already decided the band will be a hit. William Hill has odds of 6/1 that they will be No 1 next Christmas. Even the five who did not make it are headed for the charts; music industry insiders say they are at the centre of a bidding war between rival record companies. Lythgoe, 51, brought Popstars to Britain after getting hooked on the Australian version. He realised that while he knew the world of auditions inside out, television audiences would find it riveting. Three thousand youngsters responded to press advertisements inviting them to audition for a new band. The early public auditions - known as 'cattle calls' - had millions of viewers cringeing as contestants who had spent too long in front of the mirror convincing themselves they had star quality faced humiliation in the struggle to reach the high notes in songs by Celine Dion, Robbie Williams and Ricky Martin.

      "body": "<p>Nearly two months after Equitable Life closed its doors to new business, more than 450,000 with-profits policyholders are still wondering what to do with their money. </p> <p>There has been strong speculation over recent days that Halifax bank is about to announce a deal with Equitable, which may include capping the liabilities that have created the insurer's crisis. But policyholders will be looking for indications from any announcement of a quick resolution to resolve the uncertainty they face over what to do with their money. </p> <p>If the uncertainty is to be prolonged the 450,000 individual policyholders and 6000 company schemes face difficulty decisions on how long to stick with the insurer. Should people take their money out as quickly as possible - as 3,600 individuals and two company schemes have already done? Or should they wait and hope the situation improves? </p> <p>One issue on which nearly everyone agrees is that there is no point in making further contributions if you have a choice and will not be hit by penalties for doing this. If you are paying Additional Voluntary Contributions into the Equitable with-profits fund, most advisers will recommend that you divert your contributions to another provider. It is up to your pension scheme trustees to set up another AVC scheme, and most trustees seem to be well on the way to doing this. </p> <p>As most people know, the Equitable has put a 10 per cent penalty, a 'market value adjustment', on transfers. This has been done to retain as much as possible of the \u00a326 billion fund. </p> <p>The crisis at Equitable developed after the insurer accepted that it could have serious difficulties in paying its debts to one group of its members - about 90,000 policyholders who hold Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) plans. After a decision by the House of Lords last summer, the rights of these people were reasserted to ensure they receive annuities fixed at very attractive rates (of more than 12 per cent in many cases). Equitable, which had hoped to wriggle out of this arrangement, has estimated its liability at \u00a31.5 billion - but it could be more if interest rates go down. </p> <p>Since UK interest rates are expected to do just that, possibly this week, Equitable will find it more difficult to fund its commitment to the GAR holders. Or, putting it another way, if prevailing UK rates were pegged above the level of the GARs, Equitable would not have a problem: it could pay its liabilities just by investing its capital in the money markets. Now, it is very difficult to earn that kind of return. </p> <p>Since the GARs will be funded from the with-prof its fund, the other members of the fund will suffer 'a corresponding reduction in the benefits' of their policies. Hence, the big question for many investors: should they bail out now, taking the 10 per cent penalty on the chin? </p> <p>Actuary Ronnie Sloan is one adviser who thinks they should. Edinburgh-based Sloan who has always been sceptical about Equitable Life's financial strength and performance, has never put any clients into Equitable funds and has taken several out. 'It is possible that the penalty for moving funds out could become nearer 20 per cent than the 10 per cent it is now,' he says. </p> <p>He is concerned that Equitable could use its discretion to raise the penalty to 15 per cent if people continue to transfer funds out. About 1 per cent of the fund's value was transferred in the six weeks after 8 December, when Equitable closed to new business. This may sound low - but, if it continued, the fund would lose a tenth of its size in a year, leaving fewer funds and policyholders to pay out the GARs. </p> <p>Another concern revolves around the bonus declaration that is due to be made by Equitable on the with-profits fund at the end of this month or early March. 'The value of people's funds could go backwards,' says Sloan. The situation is that Equitable decided there would be no bonus attributable to the seven-month period from January to the end of July last year; the money saved would go towards the GAR debt. Since 1 August, Equitable has worked on the basis that the bonus rate from that date onwards would be 9 per cent a year - the same as operated before the bonus freeze. </p> <p>But Sloan believes it is unlikely that the bonus declared will actually be 9 per cent. Provisional figures published by the Equitable last month show that 'the sterling with-profits fund achieved a total return of plus 2.7 per cent last year'. </p> <p>Although the directors have the discretion to grant a higher bonus, there is a 6.3 per cent gap to get up to 9 per cent and the company is in financial crisis. If the bonus is less than 9 per cent, policy values will go below current valuations - effectively adding to the 10 per cent penalty on transfers. </p> <p>Sloan - who is offering a policy valuation analysis under different financial scenarios (available at ronnie@sloan42.fsnet.co.uk) - believes that people who want to transfer out now, at current policy valuations, should get their applications in quickly - in time to get the transfer processed before the bonus is declared. </p> <p>However, it has to be said that Sloan sits towards one end of the spectrum in his expressed views. 'It's not clearly the case that people should be transferring out,' says Raj Mody of actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow. 'The market value adjustment could go up and it could go down. Investors should not be taking any rash actions.' </p> <p>Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown tells investors to consult financial advisers. The worst-case scenario, he says, is that the market value adjustment could go up - but in the best case scenario, the with-profits fund does not have to pay out more on the GARs and its investment returns are on a par with other funds. </p> <p>Equitable has said that it will have to take a more cautious investment approach and switch more of the fund into fixed-interest securities and away from equities. In a more typical investment climate this would depress investment returns - but, in the current slightly difficult environment, that is debatable. 'You could argue that fixed-interest stocks could be a good thing.' says Dampier. </p> <p>Amanda Davidson of adviser Holden Meehan describes the issue as difficult, but concludes: 'If you are in your thirties, have a personal pension in the fund and don't have a GAR, there is a good argument for getting out and taking the 10 per cent hit. The trickier ones are the people who are nearer retirement.' She can also see the scope for more bad news.Donna Bradshaw of Fiona Price &amp; Partners also says that advice will have to vary depending on each policyholder's age, circumstances and temperament, but says: 'If you haven't been in too long, it is probably just as well to move now.' </p> <p>The Equitable crisis is deeply depressing for the City. At least Robert Maxwell was a crook. But the directors of the Equitable seem just to have bungled - under the quiet, unquestioning gaze of the City regulators. </p> <p>The Equitable website (<a href=\"http://www.equitable.co.uk\">www.equitable.co.uk</a>) poses the question 'Should I take my money away? Should I stop paying premiums?' It starts its answer with 'There is no need for immediate action.' </p> <p>Not everyone will agree with that.</p>",

It smacks of privatisations (who can forget Sid?) and has provoked a similar level of response. </p> <p>More than a million retail investors have already signed up, attracted by a combination of clever advertising, the strength of the Orange brand name, the 4 per cent discount for private buyers - and, perhaps, the memory that last time Orange floated, its shares rose more than tenfold in less than four years. </p> <p>Will Orange be such a bonanza this time around? It would be rash to bet on it. Indeed, the risks of the flotation are such that most private investors would be advised to avoid the share issue completely. </p> <p>That is certainly not because Orange is a weak brand. Although it is still in third place in the mobile market here, behind Vodafone and BT Cellnet, it is the fastest growing and has the lowest level of customer losses . In France, its other key market, it is the leading player, with almost half the market. </p> <p>Nor is it because of worries about demand for mobile phones.

      "bodyText": "It is the most enticing advert: a cute little girl in a swimming costume dances on a beach, a mobile phone beams the images back home - perhaps to Daddy, beavering away in an investment bank on the flotation of Orange. It smacks of privatisations (who can forget Sid?) and has provoked a similar level of response. More than a million retail investors have already signed up, attracted by a combination of clever advertising, the strength of the Orange brand name, the 4 per cent discount for private buyers - and, perhaps, the memory that last time Orange floated, its shares rose more than tenfold in less than four years. Will Orange be such a bonanza this time around? It would be rash to bet on it. Indeed, the risks of the flotation are such that most private investors would be advised to avoid the share issue completely. That is certainly not because Orange is a weak brand. Although it is still in third place in the mobile market here, behind Vodafone and BT Cellnet, it is the fastest growing and has the lowest level of customer losses . In France, its other key market, it is the leading player, with almost half the market. Nor is it because of worries about demand for mobile phones. The market has grown far faster than even Orange predicted when it floated in 1996. More than half of us already own one, and penetration could reach close to 100 per cent within a few years.

Never did such a duplicitous, scheming, manipulative, sinister, repellent shyster slither across the face of this Earth.</p> <p>Myself, I could never quite see him as the Machiavelli of legend. Had he possessed a fraction of the cunning attributed to him, Peter Mandelson would today be a member of the Cabinet. It always seemed to me that the mantle of the intriguer was a fairly transparent cloak around a talented but deeply insecure and emotionally volatile man. He had too many comic and vulnerable dimensions to be a truly hateable figure. But then, he never, not so far as I am aware, attempted to have me sacked. I might feel differently had he done so. To understand the buckets of vitriol poured over his head by the political editor of the Sun, it helps to know that Mandelson once lobbied Rupert Murdoch to fire Trevor Kavanagh, a crude act which Murdoch promptly reported back to an understandably unforgiving Kavanagh. Subtlety was never a Mandelson strong suit.</p> <p>'Peter's crime was not a heinous one,' so Tony Blair told a private meeting of Labour MPs. So why then, as none of his backbenchers had the nerve to cry out to the Prime Minister, did you sack him? An answer to that is provided by the revisionist school of the Fall. They would have us believe in Mandelson the Martyr. When the true scale of the monstrous stitch-up perpetrated on a wickedly traduced man is finally recognised, this appallingly abused public servant will be canonised. The Patron Saint of Spin Doctors, perhaps.</p> <p>The most loyal and articulate advocate from this school is Robert Harris who sees 'a kind of contemporary Dreyfus affair'. That would make Robert 'a kind of' Emile Zola, the great campaigner against injustice, rather than an accomplished penner of thrillers. Even Robert might concede that Zola's call to arms - 'Truth is on the march. Nothing can stop it now' - could not be employed on behalf of his fallen friend without provoking mirth even among his other admirers. Mandelson has not been consigned to 12 years of exile on the leper colony of Devil's Island, though, in his own wretched mind, being confined to holding constituency surgeries in Hartlepool may seem an equally diabolical fate.</p> <p>What the pro-Mandelson and anti-Mandelson schools have in common is a weakness for detecting vast conspiracy. One side can only see him as a malevolent plotter, the other as the victim of a despicable plot. The real hallmark of the Mandelson Affair - and this is why it tells a broader truth about the Government - is panic. All the important characters were driven by white-knuckled, spine-shuddering fear. Fear of being found out; fear of losing face and authority; fear of being deprived of power.</p> <p>The panic began in the head of Peter Mandelson when the Home Office first alerted him to the inquiries about his involvement with the Hindujas. By some accounts, he wrangled no less than half-a-dozen times in his attempts to suppress exposure. It is not hard to imagine the judgment-paralysing anxiety attack that gripped him. Dome-Indian plutocrats-passports. It screamed headlines of sleaze. After the Robinson home loan, nothing could be more prejudicial to the future of Mandelson than to be associated with more scandal. In the plausible words of Alastair Campbell, his reaction was: 'Media alarm bells ringing - get me out, I don't want to be there.' It is impossible not to savour the irony of the spin machine being unleashed so savagely against the man who built it.</p> <p>Believe it or not, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary thought he was being kind when he told last Sunday's papers that Mandelson was 'unfocused' and 'slightly detached'. Even on Mandelson's own contradictory chronicle of the days leading up to his downfall, he entangled himself in a sequence of misleading statements which had the effect of summoning the inferno which immolated his career.</p> <p>Panic it was again inside Number 10 during the Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Peter's friends talk of a 'kangaroo court' dispensing a summary death sentence with Jack Straw playing the role of Knacker of the Yard, the Cabinet Secretary as prosecuting counsel, Derry Irvine as the hanging judge and Campbell as executioner. A weak and frantic Tony Blair is cast as the hapless juror, bullied and bamboozled by the others into pronouncing a guilty verdict on his old friend.</p> <p>It is arguable that the Prime Minister might have saved him, or at least won a stay of execution, until after the report of the Hammond inquiry, though it would have been at great cost to the Government. But Mandelson of all people should be able to grasp why Tony Blair did not. The same headlines that whirled through his mind when he set his compass for catastrophe were reeling through the head of the Prime Minister. Had it been any other Minister but himself, Mandelson would have been on the hanging bench, advising the leader to terminate with extreme prejudice someone who had not once, but twice, brought such trauma upon the Government. No one played a more instrumental role than Mandelson in teaching his party that, set against holding power, nothing and no one was unexpendable.</p> <p>Never forget the neuroticism embedded in New Labour. The group of people least confident that they will win the election are those at the heart of the Government. They wake up every morning asking themselves: 'How can we lose?' And if it is true that Mandelson was served up to appease the media with which Tony Blair is over-fixated, then it is also true that no one was more responsible for tutoring this Prime Minister to be mesmerised by the media than Mandelson. As ye spin, so shall ye reap.</p> <p>The panic is not over. The former Northern Ireland Secretary is not famed for being one to take his revenge cold. He has usually preferred to serve it oven hot. Expelled from the radioactive core of New Labour, he is now a chunk of uncontained plutonium, capable of spreading toxicity over a wide area. His friends murmur menacingly that unless he is allowed to emerge from this affair without a stain on his character he might be reminded of hitherto unexposed details of other matters which could bring discredit on the Government. That sounds like blackmail.</p> <p>Fingers are triple-crossed at Number 10 that a residual loyalty to what he helped create will assert itself more strongly than the thirst to wreak havoc on those he blames for his destruction. The timely appearance of Arthur Scargill as a Jurassic Labour candidate for Hartlepool, along with the relish with which the Conservatives have exploited the affair, might just serve to remind both Mandelson and his former friends who are the greatest enemies of what they are all still supposed to believe in.</p> <p>The wider damage, the disillusion with politics further impregnated into the voters, is already done. It will not be quickly forgotten, the spectacle of members of the Cabinet branding Mandelson as a teller of 'silly lies' (Clare Short) and 'untruth' (Jack Straw). This was the man who, just days before, was the close trustie of the Prime Minister and leading purveyor of his election promises.</p> <p>They shouldn't draw consolation from the thought that the voters regard New Labour and the Tories as equivalent in sleaze. 'They're all as bad as each other' - the wisdom of the saloon bar - serves the Right. The idea that all government is brutal, nasty and corrupt ultimately favours those, the Conservatives, who contend that the only good government is little government.

In answer to one question, Summers emphasised that he did not believe in 'periodic purges' for the sake of it, adding that 'one can go too far in that direction'. </p> <p>But his analogy reminded one of that well-known American/Austrian Joseph Schumpeter, a great authority on business cycles, who was far more enthusiastic than Summers about the benefits of 'purges' and 'creative destruction' and who never got on too well with Keynes. </p> <p>I hasten to add that I am not forecasting gloom and doom and a Thirties-style Depression.

      "body": "<p>The figures alone are mind-boggling: 230 witnesses; 85 days of evidence covering 10,000 pages of transcript; a final bill in excess of \u00a360 million. With these sorts of numbers, many believed that the end of the Lockerbie trial, the culmination of the biggest murder investigation in British legal history, would provide a definitive account of how and why Pan Am flight 103 was torn apart by a bomb in December 1988, showering the Scottish town with burning wreckage.</p> <p>That, at least, was the expectation on Wednesday at Camp Zeist, the specially constructed Scottish court in the Netherlands where the trial of the two Libyans accused of bombing flight 103, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, had unfolded in highly complicated detail for more than eight months. At last, we were about to find out what the picture looked like with all the pieces of the jigsaw in place.</p> <p>A little after 11am local time, Lords Sutherland, Coulsfield and MacLean filed in. In the public gallery, packed with the families of the victims and of the accused, along with the international press pack, there was near-total silence. Then came the verdicts, pronounced quietly but deliberately by the presiding judge, Lord Sutherland. Megrahi: guilty. Fhimah: not guilty. Dramatic stuff. But with the result also came a strange sense of dissatisfaction, a feeling that the verdict had failed to reveal anything more than a hazy outline of the true picture, let alone the completed jigsaw.</p> <p>The case against the Libyans was based entirely on a complicated web of circumstantial evidence. So ephemeral, in fact, that few reporters entered the court on Wednesday expecting either of the accused to be convicted. That the judges decided there was enough evidence to find Megrahi guilty beyond reasonable doubt was surprising enough. More unsettling, however, was that their 82-page written judgment managed to leave open so much room for continued doubt over the downing of flight 103.</p> <p>The disquiet centres on the heavy reliance placed by their lordships on the evidence of just one witness, a Maltese shopkeeper who sold the items of clothing established as being in the same Samsonite suitcase on flight 103 as the bomb. In interviews with police and in court, Tony Gauci picked out Megrahi as closely resembling the man who bought the clothes. He was, however, extremely careful never conclusively to identify Megrahi as the customer.</p> <p>Yet the judges, while accepting that the identification evidence is not absolute, found it convincing enough. However, their judgment does not tackle the key issue - how Megrahi managed to slip an unaccompanied bag past the security operation at Luqa airport in Malta on to a flight to Frankfurt, past the X-ray machines and other security measures there on to a feeder flight to Heathrow and then on to flight 103 bound for New York. The prosecution case was that Fhimah, who worked as a manager for Libyan Arab Airlines at Luqa, had helped him, but with Fhimah acquitted, no alternative explanation was offered.</p> <p>The judges themselves acknowledge the difficulties in the prosecution case but there was other evidence which put Megrahi in the frame. He was in Malta around the time Gauci believes he sold the clothes. He also flew to Malta from Tripoli on 20 December 1988, the night before the bombing, leaving the following morning. He made the visit under an assumed name using a coded passport given to him as a member of the Libyan intelligence agency, the JSO. He had also had close contact with MeBo, the Swiss manufacturer of the timing device used in the Pan Am bomb.</p> <p>All this taken together, the judges said, made it possible for Megrahi's guilt to be inferred beyond reasonable doubt. Perhaps, but it is the absence of hard factual detail and the openness to interpretation of so many of the key pieces of prosecution evidence that leaves many sceptical about the result.</p> <p>The judges did have another option. Many who have followed the case expected them to find the case against Megrahi 'not proven', the third verdict available under Scots law. When this failed to materialise, the theory which went round Camp Zeist was that the judges had 'bottled' a 'not proven' verdict because they didn't want to risk throwing the Scottish legal system open to international ridicule. The not proven verdict has come to be regarded as a reluctant acquittal, a cop-out which allows juries to avoid making the difficult decision of finding an accused person guilty or not guilty by setting them free with a permanent stain on their character.</p> <p>But the Lockerbie judges were never going to go down this road. Not because they feared an adverse impact on the Scottish legal system's international reputation, but because justice demanded that their verdicts were unequivocal. That they achieved, but serious doubt remains as to whether the same could be said for the bombing scenario portrayed in their judgment.</p> <p>So forget about the witness count, the cost and all those other impressive statistics. Until the full truth is established, only two figures will continue to have any lasting resonance: 270 dead and, 12 years on, no satisfactory explanation of how or why.</p> <p><b>The verdict</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/0131lockerbieverdict.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Full text of the judges' verdict (pdf file)</a><br> You will need Adobe Acrobat to view this file.

Compass points Nine months after Granada and Compass started their complicated game of pass-the-parcel, the music finally stopped on Friday. The two businesses that remain have reverted to their old names, but they have been wrapped up differently. Granada has been shorn of the hotel and catering assets that its bosses feared were diverting the City's attention from its real business of television.

Investors have been worried that it was saddling itself with a bunch of hotels just when the market is about to go into decline, but they have been reassured by the insistence of chairman Francis Mackay that they will be sold by the end of March. That will shift the focus back to the attractions of Compass's catering and foodservice business, which vies with French group Sodexho for global leadership.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>President George W. Bush has announced that on 7 February, come hell or high water, he will end Bill Clinton's order directing emergency electricity supplies to California. </p> <p>As the lights on the Golden Gate bridge blink off, the state's politicians are in full panic that this spells bankruptcy for two giant regional electricity companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Not me. I can't think of anything which would more joyously combine historic justice and good public policy than their corporate death. </p> <p>To understand why, we need to identify the true villains of the California electricity disaster: the British. </p> <p>The story begins in August 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia, with poor Jake Horton, senior vice-president for Gulf Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, an unremarkable regional electricity firm dying of a thousand financial wounds. Since the turn of the century, American states have kept tight lids on utility monopolies' profits. In the Eighties, consumer groups demanded, rightly, that power companies, including Southern, eat their losses on foolish nuclear investments. The cash-short company had resorted to such unfortunate tactics as keeping hidden sets of account books tracking non-existent light poles. </p> <p>Horton, told he would be fired, was on the point of testifying to a grand jury about improper payments he made to politicians on the com pany's behalf. (The company later pleaded guilty to this felony.) He demanded and received use of the corporate jet to confront Southern's directors. Ten minutes after take-off, the jet blew up. </p> <p>Poor Jake. 'He saw no other way out,' laments former Southern chairman A.W. 'Bill' Dahlberg. But for Southern itself, Dahlberg, who took over at Southern after Horton's death, conceived of an unorthodox way out of its troubles. </p> <p>The plan: the troubled local company would take over the entire planet's electricity system and, at the same time, completely eliminate from the face of the earth those utility regulations which had crushed his company's fortunes. </p> <p>California blackouts are just a hiccup on the road to the astonishing success of this extraordinary programme. While America's papers are filled with tales of the woes of the two California companies bleeding from $12 billion in payments for electricity supplies, virtually nothing is said of the companies receiving their blood. </p> <p>The biggest sellers and traders in the new California and Western market are Enron of Houston, Reliant of Houston and Southern. The success of Southern's plan for world power conquest (or, if you prefer, 'vision for globalisation of energy supplies') hinged on Britain. As Keynes noted, the mad rants of men in authority have their origins in the jottings of some forgotten professor of economics. </p> <p>So in case you've forgotten, the professor in question here is Dr Stephen Littlechild. In the Seventies, Littlechild cooked up a scheme to replace British government ownership of utilities with something almost every economist before him said simply violated all accepted theorems: a free market in electricity. </p> <p>The fact that a truly free market didn't exist and can't possibly work did not stop Margaret Thatcher from adopting it. In 1990, Littlechild's market, the England-Wales Power Pool, went into business. On paper, it was an academic beauty to behold. In this auction house for kilowatt-hours, private power-plant owners would ruthlessly bid against each other to cut electricity prices for British consumers. </p> <p>I can't say for certain whether the market scheme failed in minutes or days, but the pool quickly became a playground for what the industry calls 'gaming' - collusion, price gouging and all means of fleecing captive electricity consumers. Ten years of hapless fixes by Littlechild and his successor have failed to stem the tide of rip-offs at the heart of this unfixable system. </p> <p>At the same time, 'deregulated' regional electric companies expertly vacuumed the pockets of captive customers. From their besieged Atlanta headquarters, Southern's executives learned they could charge in England double the price permitted in Georgia. The moment the Government permitted it, Southern bought SWEB, the old South Western Electricity Board. This was the first purchase ever by a US power company outside the States. The cash rolled in and American operators soon grabbed the majority of the British electricity sector. </p> <p>Although Thatcher's private power market scheme was a poor idea that proved worse in practice, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank adopted it as a requirement of every single structural assistance programme worldwide. The World Bank's former chief economist, Joe Stiglitz, told me how IMF and Bank teams would fly into Russia and Asia, preach the wonders of privatising electricity markets, 'and you could see the wheels turning in the local officials' minds'. Here was a means for their corruption 'rents' to multiply a thousand-fold. </p> <p>Power systems were privatised from Brazil to Pakistan and the baksheesh flowed. Or so say Pakistan's anti-corruption prosecutors although the World Bank dismissed the allegations. US power buccaneers, led by Southern and Texas companies Enron, Reliant and TXU, grabbed plants and wires on every continent save Antarctica. </p> <p>But not in the US, not at first. It stubbornly exempted itself from neoliberal 'reform', and this rankled the new international players. So the industry's lobbyists brought Thatcher's professors and their wheezing power market contraptions to California. </p> <p>In 1996, the state's legislature, inebriated by long draughts of utility political donations (entirely legal), tossed out a regulatory system which had provided reasonably cheap, clean, reliable energy to the state. Despite the British disaster, the sun-addled legislators wrote into the law itself the lobbyists' slick line that a 'deregulated' market would cut consumer prices by 20 per cent. </p> <p>My parents sent me their light bill from San Diego. Instead of 20 per cent savings, last year their energy charges rose 379 per cent. But before the bills hit, the new planetary power merchants, using a combination of money muscle and America's penchant to follow California, suckered 23 other states into adopting deregulation plans. SCE and PG&amp;E, California's two big regional distributors, wrote a UK-style 'price freeze' into the law which permitted them to stuff their accounts with $20bn in extra revenues as oil prices fell. Now that the oil market has reversed, the stacking, cramming and scheduling games the traders learned in the UK have literally come home to roost. These two companies are sinking under the $12bn in debt for the power from Southern and the other deregulated sellers. </p> <p>So I dressed for their bankruptcy burial in a dark suit and a big grin. (Fifteen years ago, working with government, I had enormous fun pushing a multi-billion dollar New Hampshire utility into bankruptcy.

      "bodyText": "President George W. Bush has announced that on 7 February, come hell or high water, he will end Bill Clinton's order directing emergency electricity supplies to California. As the lights on the Golden Gate bridge blink off, the state's politicians are in full panic that this spells bankruptcy for two giant regional electricity companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Not me. I can't think of anything which would more joyously combine historic justice and good public policy than their corporate death. To understand why, we need to identify the true villains of the California electricity disaster: the British. The story begins in August 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia, with poor Jake Horton, senior vice-president for Gulf Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, an unremarkable regional electricity firm dying of a thousand financial wounds. Since the turn of the century, American states have kept tight lids on utility monopolies' profits. In the Eighties, consumer groups demanded, rightly, that power companies, including Southern, eat their losses on foolish nuclear investments. The cash-short company had resorted to such unfortunate tactics as keeping hidden sets of account books tracking non-existent light poles. Horton, told he would be fired, was on the point of testifying to a grand jury about improper payments he made to politicians on the com pany's behalf. (The company later pleaded guilty to this felony.) He demanded and received use of the corporate jet to confront Southern's directors. Ten minutes after take-off, the jet blew up. Poor Jake. 'He saw no other way out,' laments former Southern chairman A.W. 'Bill' Dahlberg. But for Southern itself, Dahlberg, who took over at Southern after Horton's death, conceived of an unorthodox way out of its troubles. The plan: the troubled local company would take over the entire planet's electricity system and, at the same time, completely eliminate from the face of the earth those utility regulations which had crushed his company's fortunes. California blackouts are just a hiccup on the road to the astonishing success of this extraordinary programme. While America's papers are filled with tales of the woes of the two California companies bleeding from $12 billion in payments for electricity supplies, virtually nothing is said of the companies receiving their blood. The biggest sellers and traders in the new California and Western market are Enron of Houston, Reliant of Houston and Southern. The success of Southern's plan for world power conquest (or, if you prefer, 'vision for globalisation of energy supplies') hinged on Britain. As Keynes noted, the mad rants of men in authority have their origins in the jottings of some forgotten professor of economics. So in case you've forgotten, the professor in question here is Dr Stephen Littlechild. In the Seventies, Littlechild cooked up a scheme to replace British government ownership of utilities with something almost every economist before him said simply violated all accepted theorems: a free market in electricity. The fact that a truly free market didn't exist and can't possibly work did not stop Margaret Thatcher from adopting it. In 1990, Littlechild's market, the England-Wales Power Pool, went into business. On paper, it was an academic beauty to behold. In this auction house for kilowatt-hours, private power-plant owners would ruthlessly bid against each other to cut electricity prices for British consumers. I can't say for certain whether the market scheme failed in minutes or days, but the pool quickly became a playground for what the industry calls 'gaming' - collusion, price gouging and all means of fleecing captive electricity consumers. Ten years of hapless fixes by Littlechild and his successor have failed to stem the tide of rip-offs at the heart of this unfixable system. At the same time, 'deregulated' regional electric companies expertly vacuumed the pockets of captive customers. From their besieged Atlanta headquarters, Southern's executives learned they could charge in England double the price permitted in Georgia. The moment the Government permitted it, Southern bought SWEB, the old South Western Electricity Board. This was the first purchase ever by a US power company outside the States. The cash rolled in and American operators soon grabbed the majority of the British electricity sector. Although Thatcher's private power market scheme was a poor idea that proved worse in practice, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank adopted it as a requirement of every single structural assistance programme worldwide. The World Bank's former chief economist, Joe Stiglitz, told me how IMF and Bank teams would fly into Russia and Asia, preach the wonders of privatising electricity markets, 'and you could see the wheels turning in the local officials' minds'. Here was a means for their corruption 'rents' to multiply a thousand-fold. Power systems were privatised from Brazil to Pakistan and the baksheesh flowed. Or so say Pakistan's anti-corruption prosecutors although the World Bank dismissed the allegations. US power buccaneers, led by Southern and Texas companies Enron, Reliant and TXU, grabbed plants and wires on every continent save Antarctica. But not in the US, not at first. It stubbornly exempted itself from neoliberal 'reform', and this rankled the new international players. So the industry's lobbyists brought Thatcher's professors and their wheezing power market contraptions to California. In 1996, the state's legislature, inebriated by long draughts of utility political donations (entirely legal), tossed out a regulatory system which had provided reasonably cheap, clean, reliable energy to the state. Despite the British disaster, the sun-addled legislators wrote into the law itself the lobbyists' slick line that a 'deregulated' market would cut consumer prices by 20 per cent. My parents sent me their light bill from San Diego. Instead of 20 per cent savings, last year their energy charges rose 379 per cent. But before the bills hit, the new planetary power merchants, using a combination of money muscle and America's penchant to follow California, suckered 23 other states into adopting deregulation plans. SCE and PG&amp;E, California's two big regional distributors, wrote a UK-style 'price freeze' into the law which permitted them to stuff their accounts with $20bn in extra revenues as oil prices fell. Now that the oil market has reversed, the stacking, cramming and scheduling games the traders learned in the UK have literally come home to roost. These two companies are sinking under the $12bn in debt for the power from Southern and the other deregulated sellers. So I dressed for their bankruptcy burial in a dark suit and a big grin. (Fifteen years ago, working with government, I had enormous fun pushing a multi-billion dollar New Hampshire utility into bankruptcy. There, by the way, the lights are still shining bright). Unfortunately, California's governor, Gray Davis, pounded by the utilities' lobby machine and bogus power outage scares, appears to be losing his courage. He's now considering how the state can borrow money to bail out the companies and bill it to consumers. And that reveals the real wisdom of the deregulated marketplace: the brilliant method by which profits are privatised and losses socialised. gregory.palast@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>It could once have been an idyllic break from the red boxes: horseback riding, long walks and time to reflect. But for Peter Mandelson, this past week holed up in hiding in America was no holiday, rather a preparation for war.</p> <p>With only his partner Reinaldo Avila Da Silva for company, the disgraced former Minister has spent the week ringing his lawyers, poring over Government papers, and plotting what now seems to be a dazzlingly audacious operation to clear himself of accusations that he lied over the Hinduja affair.</p> <p>When the former Northern Ireland Secretary's plane touches down in London this morning, he will be ready for battle. Ten days after his dramatic resignation from the Government, an apparently dead and buried Mandelsonappears determined to prise open the lid of his coffin - despite Downing Street's frantic efforts to nail it shut.</p> <p>His unquiet ghost now threatens to haunt his party all the way to the election. What appears to be the first salvo was fired this morning: leaked lettters from an official in his former office suggesting home office minister Mike O'Brien, to whom he has denied making a direct telephone call over the passport affair, 'does not remember' precisely how the matter was raised.</p> <p>A second leaked letter from O'Brien to Mandelson, dated October 1998 - after the disputed call - advises that officials will look 'favourably' on a passport application.</p> <p>So as the Whitehall war heats up, the pertinent question remains just how the tale of a misleading minister's sad but necessary execution - as No 10 told it - could change in just four days in the press into the story of a martyr ambushed by a kangaroo court?</p> <p>And more intriguingly, does this herald a fight to the death between the master of spin and the Downing Street machine he helped to create - or could a deal already be quietly forming, allowing both sides to save face?</p> <p>So far No 10 has been remarkably tolerant of Mandelson's efforts to rewrite history. There are no plans to strip him of his Hartlepool seat - or of his dignity, by highlighting the repeated inconsistencies in his account. But patience is not limitless.</p> <p>'Everybody understands the need for him to earn a living but when it starts to become what will be interpreted by others as threats, whoever Peter is he is not a match for Downing Street,' said one well-placed Labour source. 'People genuinely want to give him some room because we realise his career has been trashed. But there is only so much slack, and after that you've got to pull the rope tight.'</p> <p>With an election only nine weeks away, the Prime Minister's greatest concern is that Mandelson is becoming a problem that will not go away. Margaret Thatcher had a rule that no political scandal, however big, could last beyond nine days. But two weeks after The Observer first broke the story of Mandelson, Keith Vaz, the billionaire Hinduja brothers and two suspiciously swiftly granted passports, it lingers like a bad smell - despite Downing Street efforts to smother it.</p> <p>Even on the night of his resignation, key Blair aides rang Mandelson's friends appealing to them not to rally publicly to his defence: would it not be better for the party if they just kept quiet? And by the weekend, loyalists were airbrushing Mandelson out of history, insisting that both the election campaign and the pro-European cause would thrive without their chief architect. Even then his detractors took care to stay anonymous, fearing retribution from beyond the grave. 'He might be dead but he's not buried,' said one.</p> <p>The phone call was anguished and its consequences far-reaching. Standing in his Notting Hill flat two days after his enforced resignation, he was demanding one more chance from Downing Street: he had new evidence, he said, from a former civil servant apparently backing his insistence that he did not personally make calls over the Hinduja passport affair.

      "bodyText": "It could once have been an idyllic break from the red boxes: horseback riding, long walks and time to reflect. But for Peter Mandelson, this past week holed up in hiding in America was no holiday, rather a preparation for war. With only his partner Reinaldo Avila Da Silva for company, the disgraced former Minister has spent the week ringing his lawyers, poring over Government papers, and plotting what now seems to be a dazzlingly audacious operation to clear himself of accusations that he lied over the Hinduja affair. When the former Northern Ireland Secretary's plane touches down in London this morning, he will be ready for battle. Ten days after his dramatic resignation from the Government, an apparently dead and buried Mandelsonappears determined to prise open the lid of his coffin - despite Downing Street's frantic efforts to nail it shut. His unquiet ghost now threatens to haunt his party all the way to the election. What appears to be the first salvo was fired this morning: leaked lettters from an official in his former office suggesting home office minister Mike O'Brien, to whom he has denied making a direct telephone call over the passport affair, 'does not remember' precisely how the matter was raised. A second leaked letter from O'Brien to Mandelson, dated October 1998 - after the disputed call - advises that officials will look 'favourably' on a passport application. So as the Whitehall war heats up, the pertinent question remains just how the tale of a misleading minister's sad but necessary execution - as No 10 told it - could change in just four days in the press into the story of a martyr ambushed by a kangaroo court? And more intriguingly, does this herald a fight to the death between the master of spin and the Downing Street machine he helped to create - or could a deal already be quietly forming, allowing both sides to save face? So far No 10 has been remarkably tolerant of Mandelson's efforts to rewrite history. There are no plans to strip him of his Hartlepool seat - or of his dignity, by highlighting the repeated inconsistencies in his account. But patience is not limitless. 'Everybody understands the need for him to earn a living but when it starts to become what will be interpreted by others as threats, whoever Peter is he is not a match for Downing Street,' said one well-placed Labour source. 'People genuinely want to give him some room because we realise his career has been trashed. But there is only so much slack, and after that you've got to pull the rope tight.' With an election only nine weeks away, the Prime Minister's greatest concern is that Mandelson is becoming a problem that will not go away. Margaret Thatcher had a rule that no political scandal, however big, could last beyond nine days. But two weeks after The Observer first broke the story of Mandelson, Keith Vaz, the billionaire Hinduja brothers and two suspiciously swiftly granted passports, it lingers like a bad smell - despite Downing Street efforts to smother it. Even on the night of his resignation, key Blair aides rang Mandelson's friends appealing to them not to rally publicly to his defence: would it not be better for the party if they just kept quiet? And by the weekend, loyalists were airbrushing Mandelson out of history, insisting that both the election campaign and the pro-European cause would thrive without their chief architect. Even then his detractors took care to stay anonymous, fearing retribution from beyond the grave. 'He might be dead but he's not buried,' said one. The phone call was anguished and its consequences far-reaching. Standing in his Notting Hill flat two days after his enforced resignation, he was demanding one more chance from Downing Street: he had new evidence, he said, from a former civil servant apparently backing his insistence that he did not personally make calls over the Hinduja passport affair. Surely this changed everything? The rebuff was gentle but firm: it was too late now, the inquiry would cover all that. 'It might be water under the bridge to you but it's not to me!' Mandelson retorted furiously. By the time he hung up it was clear, had there ever been any doubt, he was not going to go quietly. A little over an hour later lobby journalists were being hastily summoned for a No 10 briefing dismissing him as 'detached' - timing which his friends insist is no coincidence, but evidence of a hastily conceived plot to silence him. But even before he took the call on that Friday morning from his former assistant private secretary, apparently telling him she could back up his story that he never personally intervened over the Hindujas' passports because she could remember placing a call herself, his mind had already been turning to how the apparently hopeless situation could be rescued. When the thriller writer Robert Harris spoke to his old friend on Thursday, Mandelson was dejected and miserable - brooding on headlines wishing him good riddance - but already making plans. Perhaps Harris, a respected former political journalist, could conduct an interview putting his version of events? Harris agreed to drive up to London from his home in Berkshire the next morning. It was a little before 10am when the author reached Mandelson's flat, and little after that when the call from the woman civil servant came.

On Harris's advice he also hired a lawyer, and arranged to slip out of the country on Sunday night. Meanwhile other supporters were mobilising. Even as Mandelson's defiant defence appeared in print, his former aide Ben Wegg-Prosser was writing an article for the Guardian arguing that the vitriol was not deserved. The article was backed by a tireless Harris - who insists he was driven by his own sense of injustice, not his friend's prompting - who toured TV studios last Monday arguing Mandelson had been betrayed. Friendly journalists echoed the theme. Unfriendly ones were warned by a lawyer's letter on Tuesday that Mandelson 'strenuously' denied lying and expected to be cleared by the inquiry. Even Ken Livingstone - himself no stranger to attack from Downing Street - unexecptedly joined the fray with a warning against such infighting. His friends have also protested at the choice of Sir Anthony Hammond QC to conduct an inquiry into the passport affair because of his former links to the Home Office. In short, by the end of the week Mandelson had successfully shifted the debate on to the brutal nature of his sacking rather then the reasons for his departure. It was a classically shrewd move. According to his friends, the more Mandelson has read of his papers this week the more upbeat he has actually become about his chances of the inquiry vindicating him - or at least, perhaps more realistically, fudging things sufficiently that he can exit with head held high. Crucially that inquiry focuses not on what was said in the Downing Street study in front of Lord Irvine, Alistair Campbell, Cabinet Secretary Sir Richard Wilson and Blair that fateful Wednesday morning about how Campbell came to mislead journalists on Mandson's instructions - but on whether strings were pulled to get the Hindujas passports.

'We consider it our responsibility to learn as much as we can about them.' </p> <p>The \u00a3150 million Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (Near) mission is the first to place a spacecraft in orbit round one of these rocky left overs from the birth of the solar system. The probe took four years to reach its destination after blast-off from Cape Can-averal in February 1996, and ever since has been orbiting asteroid 433 Eros, at the sedate rate of 20 mph, returning a welter of photographs of its pock-marked, crater-encrusted surface. </p> <p>The pictures reveal an object which twists and turns in its path round the sun as if rotating on a giant skewer. The ground is blanketed with rocks and boulders, some as big as houses. Giant grooves, ridges and craters criss-cross the surface. </p> <p>Near-Shoemaker (as the probe was recently renamed in honour of the late US astronomer Gene Shoemaker) has shown that the 20-mile long asteroid is rich in iron, magnesium, silicon and aluminium but about half as dense at it should be if it was made of solid rock, as most scientists had anticipated. 'We have had to rethink our ideas and now believe that Eros - and other asteroids - may actually be dense aggregates of pebbles and stones, with some spaces in between,' said asteroid expert David Hughes of Sheffield University. </p> <p>If correct, this poses a major problem for any future Bruce Willis who tries to save Earth from an onrushing asteroid. Most ideas about protecting our world from rogue objects envisage landing a nuclear bomb on its surface and then detonating it so the offending body is blasted into harmless pieces. </p> <p>But such a device would have much less effect if exploded on something composed of smaller rocks. These would absorb more of the blast while the trajectory would hardly be affected by the explosion. 'We may have to think up some other way to save Earth, if that were the case,' said Hughes. </p> <p>Given that Eros - one of a family of asteroids whose orbits bring them close to Earth - has a chance of colliding with our planet in the distant future, this problem is taken seriously by scientists. What is needed, they say, is more data about the asteroid - hence the delicate dance of death that the Near-Shoemaker probe will carry out next week. </p> <p>'We have reached the end of the mission, and have achieved all its objectives,' said Helen Worth, of the Johns Hopkins University applied physics laboratory which has been running the Near-Shoemaker project for Nasa. 'We have a little fuel left and will try to use that to land the craft on Eros - although the probe was never designed for that.' </p> <p>At 3.30pm on Monday, 12 February, mission controllers will command the craft to fire a sequence of four bursts of its hydrazine rocket, progressively slowing the probe until it drops on to the surface of Eros at about 3 mph. Given the delicacy of the manoeuvre, however, most experts rate the mission's chances of success at one in 10 and expect the craft to crash and destroy itself. </p> <p>Yet the Near-Shoemaker team believes the potential rewards justify the risk. If the probe lands without mishap, it will be able to take photographs on the surface of one of the solar system's oldest objects - although its antenna will have to remain pointing towards Earth, and its solar panels will have to function to provide power. Hence astronomers' pes simism about its prospects of survival. </p> <p>'However, even if we fail, we will have attempted the first controlled descent and landing of a rocket on an asteroid,' said Worth. 'We will still have learnt something. We will have a much better idea what not to do the next time we want to put something on an asteroid - like a bomb. And that could prove to be awfully important.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robin.mckie@observer.co.uk\">robin.mckie@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Near-Shoemaker (as the probe was recently renamed in honour of the late US astronomer Gene Shoemaker) has shown that the 20-mile long asteroid is rich in iron, magnesium, silicon and aluminium but about half as dense at it should be if it was made of solid rock, as most scientists had anticipated. 'We have had to rethink our ideas and now believe that Eros - and other asteroids - may actually be dense aggregates of pebbles and stones, with some spaces in between,' said asteroid expert David Hughes of Sheffield University. If correct, this poses a major problem for any future Bruce Willis who tries to save Earth from an onrushing asteroid. Most ideas about protecting our world from rogue objects envisage landing a nuclear bomb on its surface and then detonating it so the offending body is blasted into harmless pieces. But such a device would have much less effect if exploded on something composed of smaller rocks. These would absorb more of the blast while the trajectory would hardly be affected by the explosion. 'We may have to think up some other way to save Earth, if that were the case,' said Hughes. Given that Eros - one of a family of asteroids whose orbits bring them close to Earth - has a chance of colliding with our planet in the distant future, this problem is taken seriously by scientists. What is needed, they say, is more data about the asteroid - hence the delicate dance of death that the Near-Shoemaker probe will carry out next week. 'We have reached the end of the mission, and have achieved all its objectives,' said Helen Worth, of the Johns Hopkins University applied physics laboratory which has been running the Near-Shoemaker project for Nasa. 'We have a little fuel left and will try to use that to land the craft on Eros - although the probe was never designed for that.' At 3.30pm on Monday, 12 February, mission controllers will command the craft to fire a sequence of four bursts of its hydrazine rocket, progressively slowing the probe until it drops on to the surface of Eros at about 3 mph. Given the delicacy of the manoeuvre, however, most experts rate the mission's chances of success at one in 10 and expect the craft to crash and destroy itself. Yet the Near-Shoemaker team believes the potential rewards justify the risk. If the probe lands without mishap, it will be able to take photographs on the surface of one of the solar system's oldest objects - although its antenna will have to remain pointing towards Earth, and its solar panels will have to function to provide power. Hence astronomers' pes simism about its prospects of survival. 'However, even if we fail, we will have attempted the first controlled descent and landing of a rocket on an asteroid,' said Worth. 'We will still have learnt something. We will have a much better idea what not to do the next time we want to put something on an asteroid - like a bomb. And that could prove to be awfully important.' robin.mckie@observer.co.uk",

Fact two: commodity steel prices are at a 20-year low. Fact three: Corus exports more than half of its production to Europe, and owns substantial German and Dutch steel operations. Fact four: the exchange rate carried the pound to an overvaluation of some 40% in real terms against the euro, making those same exports desperately unprofitable. Fact five: domestic demand for steel has stagnated as British manufacturing output has stagnated. Fact six: Corus, like every British quoted company, is uniquely exposed to take-over because of the way our stock market is organised and ownership responsibilities discharged. Its British operations made a loss of \u00a3226m in the first half of this year.</p> <p>Put these facts together and the miracle is that Corus did not close more UK capacity.

The first is that commodity manufacturing throughout the West is under intense competitive pressure as a result of globalisation. Chinese, Russian and European steel, given the additional cost advantage conferred by the absurdly overvalued pound, is easy to import, and penetration mounts by the year.

First, the stock market does not value such investment and sets stupidly demanding criteria for short-term profitability. Second, if Corus's customers are not building up capacity, demand for steel will hardly grow.

'They said it is the frost, but I don't believe it - this is hardly Siberia. And the prices keep going up,' she snapped, ignoring the windmills and canals flashing past her window.</p> <p>Welcome to the world of state-run European railways, where comfort, value for money, punctuality and safety are the four tenets of rail travel. Lateness is simply not tolerated by customers used to the smooth running of their rail companies. Privatisation means nothing and safety is paramount.</p> <p>For British passengers, though, grim times are ahead. Three months after a broken rail caused a crash that claimed four lives at Hatfield, the network is still in chaos. Despite promises to forge ahead with safety improvements, including spending of \u00a315 billion by Railtrack over the next five years, the public has had enough.</p> <p>Safety fears have hit passenger numbers. Virgin Trains admits it has lost 400,000 passengers a month, while national numbers are down 20 per cent, representing a fall of \u00a3300m in income for operators.

Elly Meulenkamp was working herself into a frenzy over the delay that would cost her valuable time with the relatives she was due to visit in Eindhoven. After boarding a carriage and settling into her roomy, standard-class seat, she looked at her watch: she was four minutes behind schedule. The 64-year-old grandmother was livid. 'They said it is the frost, but I don't believe it - this is hardly Siberia. And the prices keep going up,' she snapped, ignoring the windmills and canals flashing past her window. Welcome to the world of state-run European railways, where comfort, value for money, punctuality and safety are the four tenets of rail travel. Lateness is simply not tolerated by customers used to the smooth running of their rail companies. Privatisation means nothing and safety is paramount. For British passengers, though, grim times are ahead. Three months after a broken rail caused a crash that claimed four lives at Hatfield, the network is still in chaos. Despite promises to forge ahead with safety improvements, including spending of \u00a315 billion by Railtrack over the next five years, the public has had enough. Safety fears have hit passenger numbers. Virgin Trains admits it has lost 400,000 passengers a month, while national numbers are down 20 per cent, representing a fall of \u00a3300m in income for operators. With more than 300 speed restrictions still in place and car usage soaring again, the Government's 10-year target of increasing passenger numbers by 50 per cent is looking utterly unachievable. Most of the billion annual rail journeys made in Britain are a daily commute to earn a living.

      "body": "<p>It was muggy summer's day on the endless plains of Indiana when George W. Bush rose to the pulpit of a packed little church to make his first speech as candidate for the US presidency. In 20 minutes, Bush repeated the phrase 'compassionate conservatism' 15 times .</p> <p>Bush had borrowed it from a man whose books he had read avidly; it was the title of a latest bestseller by a fervent former communist - now born-again Christian - who watched Bush from afar, on television, with a glow of satisfaction and a job in the White House awaiting him.</p> <p>His name was Marvin Olasky, and last week America was told what his 'compassionate conservatism' means in practice: a revolution that will transform the social landscape by dismantling the government welfare apparatus in favour of a vast web of churches and 'faith-based' charities. Some $24 billion of taxpayers' money could go to religious organisations for social work.</p> <p>The reformed structures, it is argued, will roll back the follies and errors of the liberal 1960s and Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society', injecting a new moral vitality into the fight against poverty - establishing a model for conservatives in Europe to follow. 'We must challenge people to get out of poverty,' says Olasky, 'and we must do so by mentoring and tutoring.'</p> <p>Opponents say that this means a government abrogating its responsibilities to the poor. And, adds Joseph Conn, director of a group called Americans for the Separation of Church and State, 'it clearly violates the Constitution and we will do everything we can to block it'.</p> <p>The entwinement of Church and State touches a raw nerve in a nation where the separation of the two is constitutionally enshrined, but where 92 per cent say they believe in God and some 40 million worship each Sunday.</p> <p>This radical social re-arrangement is the brainchild not of the President but of four apostles, religious doctrinaires steering the Bush Christian revolution. They were introduced into the President's inner circle by the confidant of George Bush Sr, the former President who has masterminded almost every move of his son's political career - the ubiquitous Svengali of the new White House, Karl Rove, the man the President has appointed as his senior political adviser.</p> <p>Foremost among the religious team is Olasky, who held a semi-political post as spiritual overseer of George Bush's Texas, now brought into the inner sanctum at the White House.</p> <p>Second is the man who this week assumed a new cabinet position, heading the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, John Dilulio - a tough Chicago Catholic, the brawn to complement Olasky's brain.</p> <p>Third is a familiar figure with a facelift: Charles 'Chuck' Colson, special counsel to Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal - the man who said he would 'walk over his own grandmother' to help Nixon out and served a jail sentence.</p> <p>And fourth is Myron Magnet, editor of a paper called City Journal , whose book The Dream and Nightmare of the Sixties Legacy to the Underclass was slipped, by Karl Rove, of course, to the Governor of Texas and turned into a manifesto for the nation.</p> <p>The premise of these revolutionaries is that the moral liberalisation of the 1960s was a terrible mistake - socially, politically and spiritually.</p> <p>The intellectual gurus of conservative revulsion were the late Allan Bloom, in his epic book The Closing of the American Mind , and Bloom's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Saul Bellow; there was also Harold Bloom (no relation) and such figures as the conservative art critic Hilton Kramer.</p> <p>The Bush revolutionaries turned their philosophies into a raw politico-religious manifesto. The sub-title of Olasky's Compassionate Conservatism is How It Can Transform America , and it is about to do just that. Bush's proposal is to put religious organisations on an equal footing with other groups competing for billions of dollars in federal grants, with no restrictions on how overt their expressions of faith can be as a condition for delivering services.</p> <p>The door is now open to any spiritual or religious group - mostly Christian churches, but also such groups as Moonies, Scientologists or Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam - to operate social services with government money.</p> <p>In 1993, Rove introduced the then Governor of Texas to Olasky, who was a teacher of journalism at the University of Texas in Austin at the time, and already a darling of the Republican Party. Newt Gingrich had pronounced Olasky's previous book The Tragedy of American Compassion as recommended reading for all Republicans during the electoral storming of Capitol Hill in 1994.</p> <p>Bush had read it too, and quoted from it during his campaign to become Governor of Texas in 1994. They liked each other, and, says Olasky, later discussed 'baseball and poverty fighting'.</p> <p>Olasky's political past was probably omitted from the conversation. Olasky was born into the Jewish faith, but as a young man he became a fervent member of the CPUSA, the Communist Party of the United States of America. Former comrades recall him as dogmatic, unswerving and staunchly loyal to the USSR.</p> <p>He travelled to the Soviet Union aboard a Russian merchant freighter - his aim being to live among the liberated Soviet workers, learn their language, read Lenin in the original and better understand the mechanics of Marxism-Leninism.</p> <p>His pilgrimage complete, Olasky returned to study at the radical campus of Ann Arbor in Michigan, where he continued to urge violent revolution against the capitalist state - until a sudden and inexplicable immersion in Western movies.</p> <p>He chose to write his dissertation on these films, and emerged from his studies as a born-again Christian, along with his (now divorced) first wife. Accounts of his conversion have him asking himself two stark questions, 'What if Lenin is wrong?' and 'What if there is a God?'</p> <p>Olasky's latest book, Compassionate Conservatism , carried a foreword by the man who is now President of the United States. It is apocalyptic stuff: 'The folks who are still on welfare are Lazaruses to be raised from the dead.'</p> <p>By the time the Bush juggernaut had rolled from that Indiana church to the Republican convention in Philadelphia, Olasky's phrase was its hallmark, and this time he was there in the audience. Now he is within the inner sanctum of the White House.</p> <p>President Bush has said that the book which influenced him second only to the Bible was Myron Magnet's.</p> <p>Magnet assails a tradition of what he calls 'benign neglect' of the poor by his own party during the Nixon years, but also believes that the1960s-based 'liberal prescriptions' have 'not only failed but in fact made the lot of the poor worse over the past 35 years'.</p> <p>Not all liberals - or indeed conservatives - agree. David Austin, a colleague of Olasky at the University of Texas, says: 'One hundred years ago there were a lot of social problems and charitable organisations barely scratched the surface...From my point of view, (Olasky's) is a very inadequate analysis'.</p> <p>Another of Olasky's neighbours in Texas is Patrick Bresette at the Centre for Public Priorities, who says: 'There's no possible way that the scope and scale of the faith-based groups can really meet the needs that are out there.'</p> <p>O f all the political closet skeletons George Bush has resurrected to form his administration,Chuck' Colson is the least expected. He served seven months in jail for obstruction of justice after the Watergate scandal, before setting up the InnerChange Freedom Initiative charity. Colson was 'born again' to Christianity and has since become a minister.</p> <p>Calling on Colson is potentially the most radical of all Bush's welfare proposals, since it would accelerate and expand the growth of the private sector within the prison system.</p> <p>Colson began his work in Texas with the enthusiastic support of Governor Bush, running what are called 'Christ-centred, biblically based' prison wings containing 'members' not inmates, who occupy 'cubicles' not cells. He argues that 'the recidivism rate is much lower' in the few prison wings managed by InnerChange, such as that near Sugar Land, Texas, or in which the charity operates a visiting or rehabilitation service.</p> <p>It is a tempting formula in a society heaving with a prison system bursting at the seams. 'Treat them like animals,' says Colson, 'they'll come back like animals. Go in and treat them with some dignity, show them the love of Christ, and let them see the transforming power they can bring into their lives.'</p> <p>'Sort of like Dead Man Walking ,' Colson was asked on television last week. ' Dead Man Walking is exactly what it is,' he replied.</p> <p>The very-much-alive man who was last week put in official command of religion in government is John Dilulio, a lifelong Democrat from Chicago and one of the youngest professors ever to be tenured at Princeton University. Although only 42, Dilulio was the theorist behind the 'tough-on crime' and intensive policing policies that the Republican New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani followed, in his transformation of the city.</p> <p>It was Dilulio who accompanied President Bush with a confident stride last Tuesday as he toured religious projects in Washington and held a forum on the role of religion in government.</p> <p>'The change we seek,' he said, 'will not come all at once, by an act of Congress or any Executive Order by the President... real change happens street by street, heart by heart, one soul at a time'.</p> <p>After the rally, The Observer was told, Dilulio went up to his old friend Joe Lieberman - Al Gore's defeated running-mate - embraced him and whispered: 'Joe, I'm surrounded by Republicans.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was muggy summer's day on the endless plains of Indiana when George W. Bush rose to the pulpit of a packed little church to make his first speech as candidate for the US presidency. In 20 minutes, Bush repeated the phrase 'compassionate conservatism' 15 times . Bush had borrowed it from a man whose books he had read avidly; it was the title of a latest bestseller by a fervent former communist - now born-again Christian - who watched Bush from afar, on television, with a glow of satisfaction and a job in the White House awaiting him. His name was Marvin Olasky, and last week America was told what his 'compassionate conservatism' means in practice: a revolution that will transform the social landscape by dismantling the government welfare apparatus in favour of a vast web of churches and 'faith-based' charities. Some $24 billion of taxpayers' money could go to religious organisations for social work. The reformed structures, it is argued, will roll back the follies and errors of the liberal 1960s and Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society', injecting a new moral vitality into the fight against poverty - establishing a model for conservatives in Europe to follow. 'We must challenge people to get out of poverty,' says Olasky, 'and we must do so by mentoring and tutoring.' Opponents say that this means a government abrogating its responsibilities to the poor. And, adds Joseph Conn, director of a group called Americans for the Separation of Church and State, 'it clearly violates the Constitution and we will do everything we can to block it'. The entwinement of Church and State touches a raw nerve in a nation where the separation of the two is constitutionally enshrined, but where 92 per cent say they believe in God and some 40 million worship each Sunday. This radical social re-arrangement is the brainchild not of the President but of four apostles, religious doctrinaires steering the Bush Christian revolution. They were introduced into the President's inner circle by the confidant of George Bush Sr, the former President who has masterminded almost every move of his son's political career - the ubiquitous Svengali of the new White House, Karl Rove, the man the President has appointed as his senior political adviser. Foremost among the religious team is Olasky, who held a semi-political post as spiritual overseer of George Bush's Texas, now brought into the inner sanctum at the White House. Second is the man who this week assumed a new cabinet position, heading the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, John Dilulio - a tough Chicago Catholic, the brawn to complement Olasky's brain. Third is a familiar figure with a facelift: Charles 'Chuck' Colson, special counsel to Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal - the man who said he would 'walk over his own grandmother' to help Nixon out and served a jail sentence. And fourth is Myron Magnet, editor of a paper called City Journal , whose book The Dream and Nightmare of the Sixties Legacy to the Underclass was slipped, by Karl Rove, of course, to the Governor of Texas and turned into a manifesto for the nation. The premise of these revolutionaries is that the moral liberalisation of the 1960s was a terrible mistake - socially, politically and spiritually. The intellectual gurus of conservative revulsion were the late Allan Bloom, in his epic book The Closing of the American Mind , and Bloom's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Saul Bellow; there was also Harold Bloom (no relation) and such figures as the conservative art critic Hilton Kramer. The Bush revolutionaries turned their philosophies into a raw politico-religious manifesto. The sub-title of Olasky's Compassionate Conservatism is How It Can Transform America , and it is about to do just that. Bush's proposal is to put religious organisations on an equal footing with other groups competing for billions of dollars in federal grants, with no restrictions on how overt their expressions of faith can be as a condition for delivering services. The door is now open to any spiritual or religious group - mostly Christian churches, but also such groups as Moonies, Scientologists or Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam - to operate social services with government money. In 1993, Rove introduced the then Governor of Texas to Olasky, who was a teacher of journalism at the University of Texas in Austin at the time, and already a darling of the Republican Party. Newt Gingrich had pronounced Olasky's previous book The Tragedy of American Compassion as recommended reading for all Republicans during the electoral storming of Capitol Hill in 1994. Bush had read it too, and quoted from it during his campaign to become Governor of Texas in 1994. They liked each other, and, says Olasky, later discussed 'baseball and poverty fighting'. Olasky's political past was probably omitted from the conversation. Olasky was born into the Jewish faith, but as a young man he became a fervent member of the CPUSA, the Communist Party of the United States of America. Former comrades recall him as dogmatic, unswerving and staunchly loyal to the USSR. He travelled to the Soviet Union aboard a Russian merchant freighter - his aim being to live among the liberated Soviet workers, learn their language, read Lenin in the original and better understand the mechanics of Marxism-Leninism. His pilgrimage complete, Olasky returned to study at the radical campus of Ann Arbor in Michigan, where he continued to urge violent revolution against the capitalist state - until a sudden and inexplicable immersion in Western movies. He chose to write his dissertation on these films, and emerged from his studies as a born-again Christian, along with his (now divorced) first wife. Accounts of his conversion have him asking himself two stark questions, 'What if Lenin is wrong?' and 'What if there is a God?' Olasky's latest book, Compassionate Conservatism , carried a foreword by the man who is now President of the United States. It is apocalyptic stuff: 'The folks who are still on welfare are Lazaruses to be raised from the dead.' By the time the Bush juggernaut had rolled from that Indiana church to the Republican convention in Philadelphia, Olasky's phrase was its hallmark, and this time he was there in the audience. Now he is within the inner sanctum of the White House. President Bush has said that the book which influenced him second only to the Bible was Myron Magnet's. Magnet assails a tradition of what he calls 'benign neglect' of the poor by his own party during the Nixon years, but also believes that the1960s-based 'liberal prescriptions' have 'not only failed but in fact made the lot of the poor worse over the past 35 years'. Not all liberals - or indeed conservatives - agree. David Austin, a colleague of Olasky at the University of Texas, says: 'One hundred years ago there were a lot of social problems and charitable organisations barely scratched the surface...From my point of view, (Olasky's) is a very inadequate analysis'. Another of Olasky's neighbours in Texas is Patrick Bresette at the Centre for Public Priorities, who says: 'There's no possible way that the scope and scale of the faith-based groups can really meet the needs that are out there.' O f all the political closet skeletons George Bush has resurrected to form his administration,Chuck' Colson is the least expected. He served seven months in jail for obstruction of justice after the Watergate scandal, before setting up the InnerChange Freedom Initiative charity. Colson was 'born again' to Christianity and has since become a minister. Calling on Colson is potentially the most radical of all Bush's welfare proposals, since it would accelerate and expand the growth of the private sector within the prison system. Colson began his work in Texas with the enthusiastic support of Governor Bush, running what are called 'Christ-centred, biblically based' prison wings containing 'members' not inmates, who occupy 'cubicles' not cells. He argues that 'the recidivism rate is much lower' in the few prison wings managed by InnerChange, such as that near Sugar Land, Texas, or in which the charity operates a visiting or rehabilitation service. It is a tempting formula in a society heaving with a prison system bursting at the seams. 'Treat them like animals,' says Colson, 'they'll come back like animals. Go in and treat them with some dignity, show them the love of Christ, and let them see the transforming power they can bring into their lives.' 'Sort of like Dead Man Walking ,' Colson was asked on television last week. ' Dead Man Walking is exactly what it is,' he replied. The very-much-alive man who was last week put in official command of religion in government is John Dilulio, a lifelong Democrat from Chicago and one of the youngest professors ever to be tenured at Princeton University. Although only 42, Dilulio was the theorist behind the 'tough-on crime' and intensive policing policies that the Republican New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani followed, in his transformation of the city. It was Dilulio who accompanied President Bush with a confident stride last Tuesday as he toured religious projects in Washington and held a forum on the role of religion in government. 'The change we seek,' he said, 'will not come all at once, by an act of Congress or any Executive Order by the President... real change happens street by street, heart by heart, one soul at a time'. After the rally, The Observer was told, Dilulio went up to his old friend Joe Lieberman - Al Gore's defeated running-mate - embraced him and whispered: 'Joe, I'm surrounded by Republicans.'",

      "body": "<p>At about eight o'clock on a warm autumn evening Ahmed al-Badoui was standing guard in a grove of olive trees on a rocky slope just beneath his village of Qibya. It was dusk and people were settling down for the night. Moonlight picked out the jagged limestone crags typical of the rolling hills and valleys north of Jerusalem. The city itself was only about 10 miles away but could not be seen. The first warning came when al-Badoui saw a dark shape flicker across the rocks at the edge of the olive field.</p> <p>At first, he thought it was someone trying to steal olives. He gripped his wooden cudgel tightly and shouted a challenge. His answer came in a hail of bullets. One smashed into his wrist, another into his side. The impact of the heavy rounds knocked 22-year-old al-Badoui, a strapping 6ft farmer, into the dusty earth.</p> <p>As he staggered to his feet he screamed to wake his village: 'The Jews are coming, the Jews are coming.'</p> <p>It was mid-October 1953. Within eight hours al-Badoui's home was rubble. By dawn the next morning Israeli special forces would have dynamited much of the village and killed 69 people. Their leader was Ariel Sharon, the man who, unless the polls are outrageously inaccurate, seems certain to be Israel's Prime Minister by the middle of this week.</p> <p>The attack was a typical Sharon operation. It was thorough, violent, ruthless, attention-grabbing and deeply controversial. His style has changed little from his first battles in the years after Israel's independence to the debacle in Lebanon that led to the deaths of hundreds of Israeli soldiers and more than 1,000 Palestinian civilians at the hands of Christian militiamen in 1982.</p> <p>Sharon's motto has been the same - always escalate.</p> <p>What that now means for the future of the Middle East peace process and for an Israel riddled with tensions is difficult to predict. But many are fearful. At a rally in the coastal town of Ashkelon last week, Sharon laid down the beliefs that worry so many. 'I will tell the Arabs that peace is no less important to you than it is to me. I have seen war and I know its horrors but the Jews have only one small country and it must be defended,' he said. 'Only I can bring you peace and security and protect Jerusalem. Because I know the Arabs and the Arabs know me.'</p> <p>The people of Qibya certainly think they know Sharon. 'He is a man with killing in his blood,' al-Badoui told The Observer last week. 'I do not know why God has let him live.'</p> <p>What happened in Qibya is still unclear. In the early 1950s, though the Israelis won the war of 1948 and established their state, the kingdom of Jordan occupied the so-called 'West Bank' and sponsored Palestinian raids into Israel itself in which hundreds of Israeli civilians were killed and wounded. The operation against Qibya, where a violent Palestinian partisan group was thought to be based, was designed to punish and chastise.</p> <p>Safia Hussein Teeb, 83, remembers al-Badoui's screamed warnings as Sharon's crack troops poured through the olive groves. 'I was at home getting ready to go to sleep when I heard the shouting,' she said last week. 'Everything was confused and we hid downstairs where the animals were. All night we could hear explosions as the Israelis blew up houses. My daughter and her husband and my nephew were killed.'</p> <p>Sharon's orders were to blow up some public buildings to make a point. He could, his superiors said, blow up a few houses as well if he felt it was really necessary. But the young commander had equipped his men with 600kgs of explosives and was determined to use them. In all, nearly 50 houses were destroyed. Most villagers died when their buildings were blown up.</p> <p>Sharon has always said that his troops thought the houses were empty. But an inspection of ruined homes in Qibya last week revealed that all but the most cursory of checks would have found anyone hiding inside.</p> <p>Two other little-known incidents from Sharon's early career have also surfaced. Earlier in 1953, Sharon led another punitive raid against an Egyptian-run refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Interviews with participants reveal that even some of his own soldiers were uneasy at his ruthlessness and objected to the plan. But the attack went ahead and 15 people were killed.</p> <p>Another alleged operation involved an ambush of women who were crossing Israel's border to get water from a village near Jerusalem. Sharon's supporters dismiss such stories as 'ancient history'.</p> <p>His television advertisements have shown Sharon, 72, play up to what one aide said was the old warrior's 'Andrex image' - soft and strong. It seems to have worked. Polls published on Friday show he has a 20-point lead over Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p> <p>In the small cafe she runs in Kohav Yair, a small, beautifully maintained, suburban town in the middle of Israel, Daniella Lieberman takes another sip of her coffee and sighs. 'It's terrible,' she says. 'We don't want Sharon but after the last year how can we vote for Barak? It's a choice between evil or failure.'</p> <p>Lieberman, 43, is exactly the sort of voter Barak needs to win over. She represents neither the hardcore right-wing Zionist and religious lobby nor the secular youth who pack the nightclubs of Eilat and Tel Aviv each Thursday night.</p> <p>A package of concessions seen as at the limit of what the Israeli public would accept was rejected by Yasser Arafat, the president of the new semi-autonomous Palestinian government, last summer. Within months, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip exploded in violence that has so far left nearly 400 dead. The majority are Palestinians, but 50 Israelis have died, including many civilians.</p> <p>A large number of Israelis - The Observer interviewed more than 70 last week - now feel that peace will not come through negotiation and believe that a harder line is needed. The economy is also languishing. 'The old collectivist spirit of sacrifice that motivated people in Israel 40 years ago has been replaced by something far more individualist,' said Tom Segev, a respected Israeli historian and journalist. 'Now whoever looks most likely to guarantee voters personal security - either physically or financially - will get their vote.'</p> <p>A series of murders of Jews in the Palestinian areas occupied by Israel, and bombs in Israeli cities, have also hardened attitudes. Though many are voting for Sharon because he is the only alternative to Barak, important sections of Israeli society are fully behind the veteran right-winger. The million Russian immigrants absorbed by Israel in the past 10 years are key. Most back Sharon.</p> <p>Sharon can also rely on the Jewish settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories and their supporters. 'The Lion of Israel', as he was dubbed for his daring military exploits in the wars of 1967 and 1973, was the architect of the first waves of settlement in the early 1970s and, as a Minister in various right-wing administrations, has done much to expand the contentious building programme.</p> <p>Though there are fewer than 200,000 settlers, they command the support of a broad swathe of Israeli right-wingers.

Emenike Pio, editor of the Asian Times, says there is concern among Asians that the British government response has been lacking. 'British Asians are not so happy that the Foreign Office only sent four representatives into Bhuj last week. They have a permanent office in India, so we thought that that response was too little. A substantial number of British Asians were killed in the disaster, but so far only two have been identified.'

Then another. </p> <p>For those not able to pay off their credit card bills within a comfortable period, one possibility is to consolidate them into an unsecured personal loan. </p> <p>Banks promote them at this time of year. The interest rate will often be lower than those on credit cards. Several lenders are charging an annual percentage rate, or APR, of under 10 per cent (see Databank, page 18). </p> <p>By agreeing to pay off a certain amount each month for a specified period, a personal loan can help people to know where they stand. </p> <p>To repay \u00a31,000 to the Nationwide building society over a year on its 9.8 per cent deal (without payment protection insurance) would cost \u00a387.63 a month, while \u00a35,000 over three years would cost \u00a3159.05 with Northern Rock (see table). </p> <p>But according to Phil Stone, of the Independent Debt Consultancy, based in Croydon, south London, paying off credit card bills like this should carry a warning. 'If you had a drink problem would you ask the bartender for advice?' he asks. </p> <p>Mark Penston, regional director of independent financial adviser Inter- Alliance, points out that consolidation changes the debt from a short-term one with high interest to a longer-term one with lower interest. </p> <p>'The total interest you end up paying is a damn sight more than paying off the credit card and taking the short-term hit,' he says. </p> <p>And he warns that often you can't get out of it early without penalties. </p> <p>Stone says: 'Our general advice is, don't borrow your way out of trouble.' </p> <p>He acknowledges that 'most people with properties in the south of England are totally solvent' and could raise money by re-mortgaging their homes. </p> <p>But he warns: 'The average person with more than \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 on credit cards, or regularly owing a third of their credit limit, has a problem.' </p> <p>Though Stone accepts that 'consolidation can sometimes be worthwhile if we can seriously reduce interest rates', too often people choosing that way out fail to deal with the basic question: 'Why did the debt arise?' </p> <p>He believes people take loans because they are spending beyond their means. 'Consolidation can work, but only if you don't suffer from human nature - if you don't have to use credit,' he says. </p> <p>Paying off your credit cards by taking out a consolidated personal loan may save \u00a320 or \u00a330 a month, but it only works if you are not going to borrow any more, says Stone. 'But unexpected things happen to us all, so this is difficult for 99 per cent of the population.' </p> <p>Stone advises: </p> <p> \u0095 Rather than go for a personal loan, first approach your credit card company. It may agree to freeze the interest on what your owe for a couple of months. </p> <p> \u0095 If you can, consolidate your debts in your mortgage. It's generally much cheaper. </p> <p> \u0095 All unsecured personal loans take far more of your early repayments in interest than later on. Typically, with payment protection insurance, borrowing \u00a310,000 means you owe \u00a318,000. Payment protection insurance is expensive, and there are loopholes to help insurers to avoid paying out. Paying off early can attract penalties. </p> <p> \u0095 Always check before taking out a loan what higher rate of interest you may be charged if you fall behind with your repayments. If you do take a personal loan tear up your cards. </p> <p> \u0095 Be realistic about how much you can repay on a fresh loan. Allow at least \u00a340 a month for unforeseen bills. Otherwise you may be forced to borrow yet more and your debts will increase. </p> <p> \u0095 If you have consolidated loans and ongoing credit card debts, pay the loan, and use any extra money to pay off your dearest card. Make at least the minimum payments on your cheaper cards. </p> <p> \u0095 Work out monthly how much you owe. If the total keeps on rising, get advice. </p> <p>The experience of Terry Lucas, a London postal worker, shows the dangers of trying to borrow your way out of trouble. </p> <p>Lucas took an unsecured personal loan of \u00a310,000 to help a member of his family, but the repayments left him short of money each month. His bank extended his loan by \u00a35,000. He was now repaying \u00a3380 from his \u00a31,100 salary, and funding the rest of his outgoings on seven credit cards. 'Robbing Peter to pay Paul was making me ill,' says Lucas, not his real name. </p> <p>But there was no going back. He took another personal loan, this time for \u00a33,000, in a vain attempt to pay off his cards. A further \u00a35,000 offered by an eager lender - aimed at paying off the first loan and his cards - led to further trouble. </p> <p>'I saw the personal loans as a short-term fix, but I never got more than a year and a half into the repayment period before I had to borrow a bigger amount to pay off my credit cards,' he says. </p> <p>Over six or seven years, \u00a310,000 had grown to \u00a323,000. He was now paying more than \u00a3600 a month simply to pay off his personal loans, and \u00a3200 to repay his card debts. With interest his debts had risen to more than \u00a367,000. </p> <p>'I was left with just \u00a3200 a month to live on. I was digging a bigger and bigger hole all the time,' he adds.</p> <p><strong>Detox for debt junkies</strong></p> <p>The Consumer Credit Counselling Service dealt with 70,000 cases last year. Clients agree a repayment schedule with the service , which distributes payments among the client's creditors. CCCS's debt counselling programme is funded by lenders. </p> <p>Sorting out serious debt can be a long slog; repayment typically takes six to eight years to complete and some clients are repaying debt for up to 10 years. The message from people helped by CCCS is to tackle debt before it tackles you.</p> <p>Among clients so far assisted by the service are: </p> <p><strong>Vicky</strong>, 28, works as a personal assistant for a large City firm with a salary of \u00a328,000. She lives at home with her mother, to whom she pays \u00a3250 per month, leaving her with a high disposable income. Working with high-spending colleagues, Vicky got a taste for designer clothes, travel and socialising and soon had debts of more than \u00a325,000. She sought help when she could barely cope with the minimum repayments and was seriously overdrawn.</p> <p><strong>Ken</strong>, 39, is a manager and married with two children. He has an income of \u00a338,000 and his wife gave up work before their second child was born. For more than 10 years Ken had taken out loans and ran up bills on his numerous credit cards. He now has debts of about \u00a3150,000, of which his wife knows nothing.</p> <p><strong>Dawn</strong>, 40, is an administrator and a single parent with a son of 9 nine and a daughter of 13. After 16 years in a secure job with a salary of \u00a320,000 per year, Dawn was made redundant in 1997. After six months of searching for a job, she was still unemployed and had to accept a job with an \u00a38,000 per year drop in pay. If she had refused to take the job her benefit would have been cut and her rent and council tax would no longer be paid. Dawn had debts of \u00a36,000, which eventually became unmanageable. </p> <p><strong>James</strong>, 38, got into difficulty after a relationship broke down. James and his partner had used credit to furnish their home but when the relationship broke up James's partner took the furniture, although the debts were in his name. James had a nervous breakdown and spent 18 months off work, using his credit cards to help pay for living expenses. When he returned to work, he had debts of more than \u00a315,000. He asked the bank for a loan but it refused and referred James to CCCS.</p> <p>Names have been changed.</p>",

He asked the bank for a loan but it refused and referred James to CCCS. Names have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>If you are trying to get your finances on a firm footing, you won't get far if you are struggling with debt. A credit card habit is enough to ensure you make little headway towards exploiting every penny you earn, even if your income is relatively high. </p> <p>As a nation we owe nearly \u00a32,000 on credit cards and loans for every man, woman and child. People seeking help with debt from counsellors with the Consumer Credit Counselling Service (C CCS), owe an average of \u00a325,000 to banks, credit card operators and other 'consumer' lenders. Nearly half of them have mortgages as well. </p> <p>Citizens' Advice Bureaux dealt with nearly 600,000 cases involving consumer debt in its last financial year, a rise of 16 per cent over the previous year. The caseload increased by 37 per cent over two years. </p> <p>Debt counsellors wereonce called in mainly when borrowers experienced a change in circumstances, such as divorce or redundancy. But policy officer Sue Edwards says: 'We are getting a lot of CABs telling us that people are seeking advice because they have taken out too much credit.' </p> <p>Edwards is convinced that people are getting into difficulty partly because they they do not understand the traps involved in credit card marketing, such as low introductory rates that rise substantially after the introductory period has ended. </p> <p>The Government has sympathy for this view and wants to know whether lenders are doling out debt too easily. The Department of Trade and Industry called lenders to a 'summit' before Christmas, and the industry is now reviewing its practices. </p> <p>In a separate Government initiative last week, the Treasury published proposals to issue seals of approval, or Catmarks, for credit cards that meet minimum criteria for terms and charges (see page 6). </p> <p>Malcolm Hurlston, who helped to found the CCCS, says his service is also dealing with an increasing workload, but he does not believe that credit is too easy to get. He argues that, while we spent 16.6 per cent more on credit cards during December - a total of \u00a38.4 billion - the average proportion of balances that were being charged interest was down significantly in the first 11 months of 2000, from 77.8 per cent to to 74.1 per cent. </p> <p>This is an indication that more people are paying off what they owe before they are charged interest and that borrowers have their debts under control. </p> <p>But Hurlston accepts that some groups are vulnerable. The CCCS is seeing an increasing number of young people, and he believes twentysomethings are coming unstuck through losing their jobs. 'People are getting indebted in their twenties and counting on working.' </p> <p>Many start their working lives with student loans and overdrafts. another problem, he says, is that people make minimum payments on credit cards and fool themselves that they are coping. </p> <p> <strong> Getting debt under control:</strong> </p> <p> Debt problems come in degrees. Despite the frightening numbers of people seeking help and the alarming sums of money they owe, most people manage their debts without difficulty. </p> <p>For many, the problem is that keeping up payments becomes a drag on finances. The difficulty with credit cards, in particular, is that they lull us into a false sense of security, and if you lose your job, you may find that a small debt becomes a big problem. Lenders also have ploys to ensure you pay as much in interest and charges as possible, such as small minimum repayment levels, and charges for late payment. </p> <p>Here's how to tackle your debts: </p> <p><strong> Step 1:</strong> Construct a budget. Look at how much you really spend, right down to coffees, dry cleaning and haircuts, to see where savings can be made. </p> <p>Edwards asks: 'Can you increase your income and decrease expenditure?' </p> <p>If you are on a very low income and at least partly dependent on benefits, you may need specialist welfare or debt advice from a CAB to see if you are claiming all the benefits to which you are entitled. The social security system has changed dramatically under the present Government, with the arrival of working families' tax credit and other new benefits and you may find you are entitled to something you are not receiving. </p> <p><strong> Step 2:</strong> Pay the bills that will keep you housed, fed and reasonably warm such as your mortgage or rent, council tax, gas and electricity. </p> <p>Then put your consumer debts into order of priority, concentrating first on clearing those with the highest rates of interest. </p> <p>A store credit card may be costing nearly 30 per cent a year, and a Barclaycard more than 19 per cent, but student loans are currently being charged at 2.6 per cent. This might mean that you make a student loan the last to be paid off. </p> <p>You may need to negotiate with banks or card companies over loans (see next step). </p> <p><strong> Step 3:</strong> Assess your situation. If your budget reveals that you do not have enough spare cash to make serious inroads into your debt, or that you cannot even keep up minimum payments, consider asking lenders to reduce payments or freeze interest. </p> <p>Edwards says borrowers can negotiate deals for themselves, but adds: 'Some banks and building societies certainly do take people more seriously if they come through a CAB.' If you do negotiate lowered repayments, be aware that this is likely to have an effect on your credit record. </p> <p><strong> Step 4:</strong> Decide whether you need specialist debt advice. Edwards says you probably need outside help if you are using one credit card to pay another, if your overdraft is increasing every month and if you are using credit cards to buy essential food on a regular basis. Another signal that you need help is if you are in difficulty with 'priority' debts such as mortgage arrears or council tax. </p> <p>A new industry has grown up over the last three years offering fee-paying debt advice. Several companies advertise these services, often offering to reduce monthly outgoings on debt. These debt management services will negotiate payments to lenders and ask you for a monthly contribution. The debt manager takes a fee of typically 15 per cent and distributes the balance to creditors. </p> <p>Edwards and other debt counsellors are sceptical about them. In some cases administrative errors have resulted in money not being passed on to lenders for months, damaging people's credit records. There are also concerns about the level of fees. Free advice is available from CABs, the Consumer Credit Counselling Service and National Debtline (details at end of article). </p> <p><strong> Step 5:</strong> If your problem can be solved with a bit of tight budgeting, look first at sav ings or investments that you could use to repay debt. You may want to keep some money in a savings account for emergencies, but investments need to be earning huge returns to outstrip what you would save by paying off debt. </p> <p>If there is no spare cash, look at whether you can cut interest paid on your cards. For people without a serious debt problem, but who want to clear borrowings, this is one of the best ways to tackle the job. </p> <p>You may be able to switch cards, and transfer existing debt, to a cheaper deal - possibly paying no interest at all for a period (see table). Cheap debt transfer rates normally apply only for a certain period of time. You need to be prepared to switch any unpaid debt to another cheap rate on expiry of the deal. </p> <p>Another note of caution: If you don't stop borrowing and cut up your old cards after switching, you will not get out of debt. </p> <p>Pay card bills before the due payment date. Unless they are paid in full each month, lenders charge interest from the date a transaction hits the account, so the longer debt remains on an account, the more interest you pay. The sooner a payment hits an account, the less you will pay in total. </p> <p>Consider debt consolidation: a cheap loan to replace a variety of expensive debts, but only as a last resort (see article overleaf). </p> <p><strong> Step 6:</strong> Set yourself a target for getting the debt paid off. When you're debt free, try to repay card debts in full each month. Most people need to borrow from time to time so watch out for cheap credit cards and loans in future. </p> <p><strong>Danger signs </strong></p> <p>Do you: </p> <p>\u0095 Have more than two cards and rising balances?</p> <p>\u0095 Pay just the monthly minimum for each card?</p> <p>\u0095 Have longstanding store card debt (at 30 per cent interest)?</p> <p>\u0095 Borrow from one source to pay off another debt?</p> <p>\u0095 Have trouble paying for essentials - mortgage, bills, food?</p> <p>\u0095 Have loans taken out to repay other debts, thereby accumulating more borrowing?</p> <p>\u0095 Regularly miss loan repayments?</p> <p>\u0095 Regularly pay for food with credit cards?</p> <p>\u0095 Face legal action by lenders?</p> <p>\u0095 Put off opening bills?</p> <p>\u0095 Row with a partner over debts?</p> <p><strong> Consumer Credit Counselling:</strong> 0800 138 1111 </p> <p><strong>National Debtline:</strong> 0645 500 511 </p> <p><strong>Citizens Advice Bureaux:</strong> see local phone books</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Medea</strong><br> Queen's, London W1 </p> <p><strong> Feelgood</strong><br> Hampstead, NW3 </p> <p><strong> The Downsizing of Hell</strong> <br>Dean's Court, London EC4 </p> <p> Deborah Warner's production of <strong> Medea</strong> displays a mind like a war zone. Everything on the stage of the Queen's is convulsed and broken by catastrophe. A splash of blood hits a screen, spouting from the back of the stage as if it were aimed towards the audience. The ground is scattered with lumps of grey concrete. The blurred figure of a woman is seen behind transparent doors, charging up and down, and roaring. </p> <p>Histrionic and over-the-top, but also ferocious and purposeful, this is a production which takes you into the heart of its heroine by echoing her at every turn. It may seem the least you could ask of a Euripides tragedy that it should be disturbing, but its events can seem inexplicably mad and bad. Medea, the notoriously witchy (in twentieth-century terms, famously clever) woman is spurned, not to say fleeced, by Jason, the husband for whom she has abandoned her home. She contrives a horrible death for his new royal bride. She then proceeds to kill her own two children. </p> <p>You might think that a Europe so wrought upon by terrible incidents of child murder would shy away from staging this mythical account of infanticide. Far from it. In the past few years it has been easier to see Medea than most Greek tragedies. Diana Rigg played the avenger at the Almeida in the early Nineties. A sardonic, dignified Scots version written by Liz Lochhead, which made a clamorous plea on behalf of its heroine, was one of the highlights of last year's Edinburgh Festival. In Paris, Isabelle Huppert has just had a huge success in the part. </p> <p>Warner, more interested in family than dynasty, skilfully underlines the emotions which drive Medea to action. In a tender opening sequence, Medea's two small sons, rigged out as baby warriors, sail their toy boats across a pond, in imitation of their father's naval exploits. When Jonathan Cake's plausible, patronising Jason greets his discarded wife, sexual passion still flickers through the recriminations. With murder in her heart and on her hands, Fiona Shaw's Medea methodically tidies up the toys of her children. Observing this on the first night at the Queen's, the barrister Helena Kennedy remarked that she'd seen such behaviour before: when she'd been defending battered wives who had lashed out. </p> <p>Not that Warner's is merely a domesticated version of Euripides. It stars, after all, that least kitchen-sinky of actors. Shaw has recently described Medea as being 'very normal': luckily, this unconvincing conception is not something she puts across in her acting. Her gift is for conveying not normality but a hyperactive, flayed sensibility. She overdoes the restlessness: she's unable to say 'Apollo' with out doing an Apollo mime. But her fidgets are unimportant compared to her achievement, the big arc of furious desperation that she traces. </p> <p>She arrives subdued in a cardigan - her moments of stillness and concentration are so arresting that you long for more of them. She shifts gear, delivering her speeches as chewed-up and broken-backed fragments - mostly bitter, sometimes humorous. Then, in a memorable moment, she lilts out the most resonant line in Kenneth McLeish's and Frederic Raphael's fine translation: 'My lovely life is lost. I want to die.' It's a performance which touches on the epic as well as the intimate. Few parts for women have this range; here's a production that captures it. </p> <p>The striking thing about Alistair Beaton's new play <strong> Feelgood</strong> is that it's taken so long to happen. This is the first full-length satire on New Labour since Blair's government took office. There've been flutters on the stage before - notably from Tariq Ali and Howard Brenton - but the task of dramatic deflation has largely been left to stand-ups and impersonators. </p> <p>You have to be pleased about this oxygenation of the theatre by contact with current affairs. Feelgood may not break any news, and it's certainly not going to change anyone's mind: Thatcher's harsh radicalism was mirrored in Spitting Image ; Blair's blandness is reflected in a play of sturdy, cosy traditionalism. But it's ebullient and well-turned - 'a job culture not a yob culture' - and, under Max Stafford-Clark's brilliantly tight and swift direction, its mixture of slapstick and savvy is often very funny, and at times incisive. </p> <p>The big target is the easy one of New Labour and spin. The lesser targets include hospital waiting lists, John Prescott's big cars and Railtrack: so starved are theatre audiences of contemporary references, that a mild jest on these subjects provokes a ripple of approval.

      "bodyText": "Medea Queen's, London W1 Feelgood Hampstead, NW3 The Downsizing of Hell Dean's Court, London EC4 Deborah Warner's production of Medea displays a mind like a war zone. Everything on the stage of the Queen's is convulsed and broken by catastrophe. A splash of blood hits a screen, spouting from the back of the stage as if it were aimed towards the audience. The ground is scattered with lumps of grey concrete. The blurred figure of a woman is seen behind transparent doors, charging up and down, and roaring. Histrionic and over-the-top, but also ferocious and purposeful, this is a production which takes you into the heart of its heroine by echoing her at every turn. It may seem the least you could ask of a Euripides tragedy that it should be disturbing, but its events can seem inexplicably mad and bad. Medea, the notoriously witchy (in twentieth-century terms, famously clever) woman is spurned, not to say fleeced, by Jason, the husband for whom she has abandoned her home. She contrives a horrible death for his new royal bride. She then proceeds to kill her own two children. You might think that a Europe so wrought upon by terrible incidents of child murder would shy away from staging this mythical account of infanticide. Far from it. In the past few years it has been easier to see Medea than most Greek tragedies. Diana Rigg played the avenger at the Almeida in the early Nineties. A sardonic, dignified Scots version written by Liz Lochhead, which made a clamorous plea on behalf of its heroine, was one of the highlights of last year's Edinburgh Festival. In Paris, Isabelle Huppert has just had a huge success in the part. Warner, more interested in family than dynasty, skilfully underlines the emotions which drive Medea to action. In a tender opening sequence, Medea's two small sons, rigged out as baby warriors, sail their toy boats across a pond, in imitation of their father's naval exploits. When Jonathan Cake's plausible, patronising Jason greets his discarded wife, sexual passion still flickers through the recriminations. With murder in her heart and on her hands, Fiona Shaw's Medea methodically tidies up the toys of her children. Observing this on the first night at the Queen's, the barrister Helena Kennedy remarked that she'd seen such behaviour before: when she'd been defending battered wives who had lashed out. Not that Warner's is merely a domesticated version of Euripides. It stars, after all, that least kitchen-sinky of actors. Shaw has recently described Medea as being 'very normal': luckily, this unconvincing conception is not something she puts across in her acting. Her gift is for conveying not normality but a hyperactive, flayed sensibility. She overdoes the restlessness: she's unable to say 'Apollo' with out doing an Apollo mime. But her fidgets are unimportant compared to her achievement, the big arc of furious desperation that she traces. She arrives subdued in a cardigan - her moments of stillness and concentration are so arresting that you long for more of them. She shifts gear, delivering her speeches as chewed-up and broken-backed fragments - mostly bitter, sometimes humorous. Then, in a memorable moment, she lilts out the most resonant line in Kenneth McLeish's and Frederic Raphael's fine translation: 'My lovely life is lost. I want to die.' It's a performance which touches on the epic as well as the intimate. Few parts for women have this range; here's a production that captures it. The striking thing about Alistair Beaton's new play Feelgood is that it's taken so long to happen. This is the first full-length satire on New Labour since Blair's government took office. There've been flutters on the stage before - notably from Tariq Ali and Howard Brenton - but the task of dramatic deflation has largely been left to stand-ups and impersonators. You have to be pleased about this oxygenation of the theatre by contact with current affairs. Feelgood may not break any news, and it's certainly not going to change anyone's mind: Thatcher's harsh radicalism was mirrored in Spitting Image ; Blair's blandness is reflected in a play of sturdy, cosy traditionalism. But it's ebullient and well-turned - 'a job culture not a yob culture' - and, under Max Stafford-Clark's brilliantly tight and swift direction, its mixture of slapstick and savvy is often very funny, and at times incisive. The big target is the easy one of New Labour and spin. The lesser targets include hospital waiting lists, John Prescott's big cars and Railtrack: so starved are theatre audiences of contemporary references, that a mild jest on these subjects provokes a ripple of approval. At the centre is a Mandelsonian figure - complete with an expensive reclining chair and the adjective 'detached' - who's faced with a major challenge. Secret government-approved cultivation of GM hops has led to beer-drinkers sprouting breasts. This news must be suppressed, although, as his Old Labour ex-wife protests: men with tits - it's surely the Third Way? There's an unconvincing ending and a dip in the middle when Beaton drops his grin and spells out his moral purpose. Cut these, and Hampstead have a neat little West End winner on their hands. Central to its success is a wonderful performance by Henry Goodman: he ducks and dives like a boxer; he swivels and shimmies like a dancer; he drips sincerity like - well, like a spin doctor. New Labour is also sceptically scrutinised in Stephen Hancocks's The Downsizing of Hell which envisages a third way springing from an accommodation between a tweedy angel Gabriel and a compliant devil; Charlotte Dailey's persuasive, luscious temptress agonises and mediates. It's a roughly staged piece, but it perfectly illustrates the point of site-specific work. This polemic about moral values and corporate culture is set in a temple to Mammon: a gleaming, mirror-lined disused banking hall; but through its long windows you see the smoky blue dome of St Paul's.",

      "body": "<p>By general consent, and with the exception of very few hedgerows and hills, the vanguard art of the twentieth century was never exactly rural. Nobody rode around on horseback any more, looking slowly at the fields, or hauled an easel into the great outdoors to revolutionise painting. C\u00e9zanne had conquered his mountains by 1900; Monet had long since floated his lilies. </p> <p>More of the world could be seen, faster and even from above, by plane, train or automobile. Artists moved, migrated, converged on the metropolis which ousted landscape as art's central image. The view from the studio window was the electrified street; the city became the site of the modern. </p> <p>All of which underpins Tate Modern's bold decision to make its first loan show such a crowded megalopolis in its own right. Century City aims to trace the century's art through some of its largest cities, from Moscow and London to Tokyo and Paris, finishing in contemporary Bombay. With nine cities, 10 decades and literally thousands of works of art, it's a long haul of a trip to make. Like the cities it evokes, it is also maddeningly uneven - spectacular sights leading to gloomy backwaters and surprising disappointments. But it turns out to be a trip worth taking, often for the most unexpected reasons. </p> <p>Not least of these are the times and places chosen for the exhibition. Any survey of twentieth-century art might want to include futurism, dada, surrealism, expressionism - German and abstract - pop, conceptualism and so forth. This one doesn't. It goes to Fifties Lagos to look at African carving, to Sixties Rio for neoconcretism, to Bombay in the Nineties for video installations. That's partly because the folks at Tate Modern would rather work at Ikea, you feel, than take a conventional approach to art. But it is also because their interest in urban ferment is not just cultural, it's fully political. </p> <p>In this and every other respect, there is no better place to start than Moscow on the eve of the October Revolution. It would be hard to overstate the exhilaration of these opening galleries. At the threshold stands Aleksandr Shukov's silver tower, its delicate structure tapering up to the roof, a hymn to the miracle of soundwaves, a monument that doubles as a radio mast. Beyond it run great avenues of radical art: Malevich's first suprematist paintings, El Lissitzky's Proun compositions, Tatlin and Rodchenko's two-colour posters for everything from Battleship Potemkin to workers' rallies, the most dynamic forms of public address in art history. </p> <p>The future of socialism had to be built right into the city. Here are the prototypes for airy glass buildings, revolving kiosks, social clubs and 16-floor libraries. Here are Aleksei Gan's exquisite, semi-abstract photographs of the hands that gripped the tools, and Dsiga Vertov's day in the life of Moscow workers, filmed in the 1920s, with its amazing use of split-screen, slow-mo and jump-cut. In an age of revolutionary aesthetics, productivity becomes an issue. Besides easel painting, renounced by some artists as bourgeois, these galleries are crammed with 'the art of five kopeks' - op-art overalls, 'productivist' coats and those yet-modern black-and-red linocuts. </p> <p>Above it all, Tatlin's human-powered glider hovers like an urban bird - ready to fly the streets but destined to crash to the earth. Some of these artists were purged by Stalin, others simply airbrushed right out of the picture. The thrill of seeing their art, retrieved from all over Russia, sometimes lovingly reconstructed, is always tempered by a melancholy presentiment of the future. </p> <p>You get the same feeling in 'Lagos 1955-70', but for slightly different reasons. This gallery just reads far better than it looks. There are a few sculptures - a monolithic Moses with elephantine ears, carved from the forked trunk of a tree; a bronze bust of Dr Azikiwe, first President of an independent Nigeria. But the rest is little more than words - magazines, streetmaps, first editions of Chinua Achebe, album sleeves for Herbert Ogunde's Song of the People . It's as if visual art was never reborn before Lagos disintegrated into violent corruption and the nation was torn apart. </p> <p>Documents versus artefacts, actuality versus art - this is the unresolved conundrum for Century City . Tate Modern doesn't have to transform itself into some urban simulacrum the way the Hayward did for Cities on the Move . It already poses as a city, with its mall, boulevards and escalators, its eyelines directly to the Thames and St Paul's. Yet it still needs to give some local context for each capital. Freud's couch furnishes 'Vienna 1908-18' pretty well; hoards of Hoxton private view cards - pompously displayed in glass cases - do nothing to evoke London in the Nineties. </p> <p>Sometimes the city materialises directly through the art. Braque recreates the slow construction of the Sacre-Coeur, angle upon curve, in 1910. The surface of Paris - its newsprint, beer mats, wine labels, cigarette packs - is scissored and glued into Picasso's collages. By the time you get to Bombay in 2000, cubism isn't so much a style as an architectural fact - witness the jam of angled roofs in Sudhir Patwardan's painting, through which the worker falls to his death, unnoticed even by the birds. </p> <p>Bombay, or Mumbai as it now calls itself, is a powerfully affecting destination. There are portraits of the lost, painted on shop-front shutters; immense photographs of the streets, in which your eye searches the morass of gutters, wires and corrugated shacks for the lone figure weaving his way to work. A film, screened in a makeshift cinema, cuts between the riots of the early Nineties, the gin-and-gymkhana crowd and the shanty dweller who can only find employment demolishing shanty towns. </p> <p>Next to this, a video of Tracey and Sarah droning on about the brief interval before they were famous looks outstandingly fatuous. It's not clear why out-takes, lists and jottings are supposed to be any kind of substitute for London art - unless it's a case of Family Hold Back. But if you aren't familiar with this genealogy, you'll certainly need the catalogue. Ditto some crucial context for Mumbai - politics, censorship, religion, the dire fate of some of these artists. The catalogue costs \u00a330, however: a shocking tax on knowledge. </p> <p>Still, you can travel light down to Rio. This is a stunning white beach of a gallery, lilting with bossa nova and strewn with abstract sculptures that perfectly reflect the bay-line waves in their cool, curvilinear structures. Some cities get the art they need, in this case, a graceful antidote to jerry-built squalor. Others get what they deserve, as 'Vienna 1908-18' demonstrates. </p> <p>This is a massive show within a show, amassing more paintings by Schiele and Kokoschka than most full-scale retrospectives. Karl Kraus called Vienna 'the experimental lab for the end of the world' - and so it seems in these tortured paintings, agonised transcriptions of neurosis, isolation and advancing syphilis. </p> <p>Don't miss Richard Gerstl's self-portraits, suicide notes that arrived too late. Or Kraus himself raving about the apocalypse in a horrifyingly prescient film from 1914. </p> <p>1914 - and there are places and decades to go before Tokyo and New York in the Sixties, never mind all the aesthetic cross-connections that run like live wires from one city to the next. One way to navigate Century City is to treat it as nine separate shows, with long pauses in between. Another is not to exercise yourself about the city theme, which isn't the object or subject of this art show in the end. </p> <p>Since French modernism is always with us, and Paris and London are especially weak, you might also consider a detour. Among the international art the Tate has borrowed from Moscow to kingdom come are some masterpieces that might not happen by again so soon. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,433119,00.html\">Deyan Sudjic on Century City's architecture</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,433105,00.html\">Ten things to look for if you haven't much time</a></p> <p><strong>Useful link</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/centuryc.htm\">Tate Modern: Century City</a></p>",

All of which underpins Tate Modern's bold decision to make its first loan show such a crowded megalopolis in its own right. Century City aims to trace the century's art through some of its largest cities, from Moscow and London to Tokyo and Paris, finishing in contemporary Bombay. With nine cities, 10 decades and literally thousands of works of art, it's a long haul of a trip to make. Like the cities it evokes, it is also maddeningly uneven - spectacular sights leading to gloomy backwaters and surprising disappointments. But it turns out to be a trip worth taking, often for the most unexpected reasons. Not least of these are the times and places chosen for the exhibition. Any survey of twentieth-century art might want to include futurism, dada, surrealism, expressionism - German and abstract - pop, conceptualism and so forth. This one doesn't. It goes to Fifties Lagos to look at African carving, to Sixties Rio for neoconcretism, to Bombay in the Nineties for video installations. That's partly because the folks at Tate Modern would rather work at Ikea, you feel, than take a conventional approach to art. But it is also because their interest in urban ferment is not just cultural, it's fully political. In this and every other respect, there is no better place to start than Moscow on the eve of the October Revolution. It would be hard to overstate the exhilaration of these opening galleries. At the threshold stands Aleksandr Shukov's silver tower, its delicate structure tapering up to the roof, a hymn to the miracle of soundwaves, a monument that doubles as a radio mast. Beyond it run great avenues of radical art: Malevich's first suprematist paintings, El Lissitzky's Proun compositions, Tatlin and Rodchenko's two-colour posters for everything from Battleship Potemkin to workers' rallies, the most dynamic forms of public address in art history. The future of socialism had to be built right into the city. Here are the prototypes for airy glass buildings, revolving kiosks, social clubs and 16-floor libraries. Here are Aleksei Gan's exquisite, semi-abstract photographs of the hands that gripped the tools, and Dsiga Vertov's day in the life of Moscow workers, filmed in the 1920s, with its amazing use of split-screen, slow-mo and jump-cut. In an age of revolutionary aesthetics, productivity becomes an issue. Besides easel painting, renounced by some artists as bourgeois, these galleries are crammed with 'the art of five kopeks' - op-art overalls, 'productivist' coats and those yet-modern black-and-red linocuts. Above it all, Tatlin's human-powered glider hovers like an urban bird - ready to fly the streets but destined to crash to the earth. Some of these artists were purged by Stalin, others simply airbrushed right out of the picture. The thrill of seeing their art, retrieved from all over Russia, sometimes lovingly reconstructed, is always tempered by a melancholy presentiment of the future. You get the same feeling in 'Lagos 1955-70', but for slightly different reasons. This gallery just reads far better than it looks. There are a few sculptures - a monolithic Moses with elephantine ears, carved from the forked trunk of a tree; a bronze bust of Dr Azikiwe, first President of an independent Nigeria. But the rest is little more than words - magazines, streetmaps, first editions of Chinua Achebe, album sleeves for Herbert Ogunde's Song of the People . It's as if visual art was never reborn before Lagos disintegrated into violent corruption and the nation was torn apart. Documents versus artefacts, actuality versus art - this is the unresolved conundrum for Century City . Tate Modern doesn't have to transform itself into some urban simulacrum the way the Hayward did for Cities on the Move . It already poses as a city, with its mall, boulevards and escalators, its eyelines directly to the Thames and St Paul's. Yet it still needs to give some local context for each capital. Freud's couch furnishes 'Vienna 1908-18' pretty well; hoards of Hoxton private view cards - pompously displayed in glass cases - do nothing to evoke London in the Nineties. Sometimes the city materialises directly through the art. Braque recreates the slow construction of the Sacre-Coeur, angle upon curve, in 1910. The surface of Paris - its newsprint, beer mats, wine labels, cigarette packs - is scissored and glued into Picasso's collages. By the time you get to Bombay in 2000, cubism isn't so much a style as an architectural fact - witness the jam of angled roofs in Sudhir Patwardan's painting, through which the worker falls to his death, unnoticed even by the birds. Bombay, or Mumbai as it now calls itself, is a powerfully affecting destination. There are portraits of the lost, painted on shop-front shutters; immense photographs of the streets, in which your eye searches the morass of gutters, wires and corrugated shacks for the lone figure weaving his way to work. A film, screened in a makeshift cinema, cuts between the riots of the early Nineties, the gin-and-gymkhana crowd and the shanty dweller who can only find employment demolishing shanty towns. Next to this, a video of Tracey and Sarah droning on about the brief interval before they were famous looks outstandingly fatuous. It's not clear why out-takes, lists and jottings are supposed to be any kind of substitute for London art - unless it's a case of Family Hold Back. But if you aren't familiar with this genealogy, you'll certainly need the catalogue. Ditto some crucial context for Mumbai - politics, censorship, religion, the dire fate of some of these artists. The catalogue costs \u00a330, however: a shocking tax on knowledge. Still, you can travel light down to Rio. This is a stunning white beach of a gallery, lilting with bossa nova and strewn with abstract sculptures that perfectly reflect the bay-line waves in their cool, curvilinear structures. Some cities get the art they need, in this case, a graceful antidote to jerry-built squalor. Others get what they deserve, as 'Vienna 1908-18' demonstrates. This is a massive show within a show, amassing more paintings by Schiele and Kokoschka than most full-scale retrospectives. Karl Kraus called Vienna 'the experimental lab for the end of the world' - and so it seems in these tortured paintings, agonised transcriptions of neurosis, isolation and advancing syphilis. Don't miss Richard Gerstl's self-portraits, suicide notes that arrived too late. Or Kraus himself raving about the apocalypse in a horrifyingly prescient film from 1914. 1914 - and there are places and decades to go before Tokyo and New York in the Sixties, never mind all the aesthetic cross-connections that run like live wires from one city to the next. One way to navigate Century City is to treat it as nine separate shows, with long pauses in between. Another is not to exercise yourself about the city theme, which isn't the object or subject of this art show in the end. Since French modernism is always with us, and Paris and London are especially weak, you might also consider a detour. Among the international art the Tate has borrowed from Moscow to kingdom come are some masterpieces that might not happen by again so soon.

      "body": "<p>The alarm rings. You jump out of bed, get the kids up and shovel cereal down them while the radio announcer counts out the minutes: 7.32, 7.41. You run for the bus, wishing you could afford a taxi, making a mental note to buy something for supper that you can stick in the microwave.</p> <p>At the office, you press the 'doors close' button in the lift in the hope of shaving off another few seconds. You arrive with a cup of takeout coffee (you're too rushed to sit in a caf\u00e9 doing nothing), to find that you already have 10 emails, four voicemail messages and that your boss wants some figures, preferably yesterday.</p> <p>Speed is increasingly equated with efficiency. Every invention - mobiles, laptops, fast food - is designed to cut corners. Haste, once a vice, is a virtue. Klaus Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum, which met in Davos last week, says: 'We are moving from a world in which the big eat the small to a world in which the fast eat the slow.'</p> <p>But not everyone wants to negotiate the world at the speed of a silicon chip. Our full-throttle lives are beset by anxieties. Some of these are minor: is it worth spending an hour programming the speed-dial on the phone to save a couple of seconds every time we make a call? Others are more troubling. Writer and inventor Stewart Brand says: 'Civilisation is revving itself into a pathologically short attention span'. We are changing the earth more rapidly than we are understanding it, yet we are so buzzing with adrenaline that we have no mental energy left to contemplate the consequences.</p> <p>The sense that this is a stupid way to live is encouraging pockets of resistance and creating a movement for slowness. Its adherents may be coming from different directions, but they have similar ends. They want to eat slowly, to live in slow cities and to extend their horizons beyond the next set of quarterly figures or the next software upgrade.</p> <p>The movement's most potent symbol is a clock, now on show in the Science Museum in London. Two metres tall, with a face that could have come straight from the Middle Ages, its stack of cogs and wheels recalls eighteenth-century Longitude -type clocks. But the construction and the materials - tungsten carbide, metallic glass and synthetic sapphire - are pure turn-of-the millennium. This clock ticks once every 30 seconds, but keeps a deeper time measured not over days or even a year but with the precession of the stars - a cycle of 25,784 years.</p> <p>It is the Clock of the Long Now, named by Brian Eno, the musician and artist, one of a number of people behind it, who came up with the idea when he was living in New York. It struck him that for most people he met in the city, 'now' meant 'this week'. 'No one had any investment in any kind of future except their own, conceived in the narrowest of terms.\"</p> <p>'Now' has contracted for all of us. As writer and consultant Esther Dyson suggests: 'On the stock exchange it's today, on the net it's a month, in fashion it's a season, in demographics a decade, in most companies it's the next quarter.'</p> <p>It's not difficult to understand why this has happened. Technology is setting the pace for human events. The fact that the computing power of a silicon chip doubles every 18 months means, for example, that analysing a complex geometrical problem, such as the three-dimensional airflows past a wing, would have taken many years with the most powerful computer available in the 1940s. By 1969, it would have taken two days, by 1976, four hours. Today it would need about 15 minutes.</p> <p>This has had a profound effect on the way we think. There seems no point in looking forward, because, even in five years, technology will have changed our lives out of recognition. In 1996, Eno and others, including Brand, Dyson, Danny Hillis, the designer of some of the world's fastest computers, and Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired, established the Long Now Foundation to try to extend the idea of 'now' and foster long-term responsibility.</p> <p>The foundation conceived of a clock that would keep time until AD11,999. Brand says: 'Ideally, it would do for thinking about time what the photographs of Earth from space have done for thinking about the environment.'</p> <p>The clock in the Science Museum is the first of four that are proposed, each double the size of the last. 'The display on the second clock probably won't be moving,' says Alexander Rose, director of the Long Now Foundation, the charitable trust behind the clock. 'A human being will be required to put it right, and then it will continue to work for one minute. The human will be the last stage in the mechanism.'</p> <p>The third clock will almost certainly be displayed in a city and the fourth - which may take more than a lifetime to complete - will be built into rock in Nevada. The foundation has bought a site in the Great Basin National Park, surrounded by 5,000 year-old Bristlecone trees, thought to be the oldest living organisms in the world.</p> <p>The four clocks may, as the foundation hopes, acquire a mythic power and encourage us to consider the future. But they are not going to do much about the whirl of the morning commute, the sense that our multitasking lives are measured out in nanoseconds (billionths of a second). For this, something closer to home is required.</p> <p>We don't pretend to be able to slow down the whole of life,' says Renato Sardo of Slow Food, 'but we do think it is possible to stop for a bit during the day. Slow rhythms at the table are better for health. Knowing where your food has come from is important psychologically. We are all going to the same place; it's better to get there slowly.'</p> <p>Slow Food began in 1986, when an Italian journalist, Carlo Petrini, was so affronted by the opening of a McDonald's in Rome that he decided something must be done to counter the homogenisation of culture and nuke-it-and-eat-it attitudes to food. The organisation now has 60,000 members in 45 countries. 'We work towards the rediscovery of the richness and aromas of local cuisines by opposing the levelling effect of the Fast Life,' claims its manifesto.</p> <p>'People today want to buy fast, eat fast,' says Sardo. 'But fast food chains are a menace to local traditions and require a particular, industrialised method of production that treats the animal as a commodity. In Italy until recently, everyone had a link to the land. I am 30, and I am the last generation to see their mothers killing the rabbit.\"</p> <p>Wendy Fogarty runs the Greater London Slow Food convivium, or chapter, with 400 members (another 200 Slow Foodies are scattered across the rest of the country). Yesterday, the London Convivium met at a Knightsbridge restaurant to taste olive oils and to eat - slowly - a three-course lunch.</p> <p>As well as indulging, Slow Food supporters also campaign - against transgenic vines and for local and, especially, unpasteurised cheeses. 'We are absolutely against the idea that good food should only be available to a few,' says Fogarty. Indeed, in 1995, a decision was taken to spread the philosophy of cultural integrity beyond the affluent West. The Slow Food Foundation is now involved in removing mines from agricultural land in Nicaragua and training families to farm and vary their diet; and in Brazil it is providing patients with infectious diseases at a hospital with nutritious, locally produced food.</p> <p>But the Slow Foodies are likely to have an uphill struggle. Scientists announced last month that they are trying to breed genetically modified pigs that will get fatter faster: a sort of just-in-time pig. The Washington Post recently reported that Lipton is now marketing a tea bag that lets you brew iced tea without boiling a kettle - just add cold water. For breakfast, General Mills offers a Milk 'n' Cereal bar, with Cheerios on the outside and milk inside, a must for anyone too busy to pour the Cheerios into a bowl and get a carton out of the refrigerator.</p> <p>We are surrounded by devices designed to save us time, from express checkout queues to remote controls. But the result of this is, paradoxically, to make us more impatient. An American study has found that moving in and out of 'computer time' makes people intolerant of interruptions from colleagues who cannot move at the speed of software. David Cannon, a British researcher, surveyed university students and concluded that, used to technology and computer games, they have trouble focusing long and hard.</p> <p>A hectic life is not automatically filled with more pleasure and meaning. Racing through everything can leave you wondering what you have been too busy to notice, too preoccupied to savour. To counter this, in late 1999, 30 Italian towns designated themselves Slow Cities. 'The model given by America has invaded our cities and risks making Italy's towns look all the same. We need to stop this kind of colonisation,' says Paolo Saturnini, the mayor of Greve in Chianti.</p> <p>In common with the Slow Food movement, of which it is an offshoot, Slow Cities favour regional distinctiveness and sustained pleasure. They have yet to roll out to other parts of Europe, although the hope is that they will begin to do so this year.</p> <p>To qualify for Slow status, mayors and councils must permit more neighbourhood restaurants (osterie), ban neon signs, combat traffic and noise pollution, encourage cyclists, plant trees and maintain parks and squares.</p> <p>In his 1996 novel Slowness, Milan Kundera suggests that speed is associated with forgetting, slowness with remembering. Hurry sickness is endangering our culture, not least because technology keeps outrunning itself. Recent history is littered with the brand names of now-useless personal computers, from the Altair to the Yamaha CX5M.</p> <p>'The years between 1950 and now will be seen as a dark age by future historians,' says Rose. 'Nasa has lost the first 20 years of its satellite data. Even if it could still be read, the magnetic tape it was stored on has deteriorated too badly. We are losing every bit of culture we are putting into digital storage.'</p> <p>In response, the Long Now Foundation is creating what it calls the Rosetta Disc - a 2.8-inch nickel disc capable of storing 30,000 pages of text. 'Being analogue, rather than ones and zeros, it doesn't have a platform-dependency problem,' says Rose. 'Language is the only platform-dependency, so we are including 1,000 translations of a single piece of text.'</p> <p>The text is the opening chapters of the Bible, the only work to have been translated so many times. Indigenous creation stories will be included on the disc, as will a list of 100 words that exist in every culture (sun, moon, you, me), from which, Rose says, it is possible to decode an entire language. The project has been funded from private donations, 'mostly from people in the technology sector, who have lived very fast-paced lives and realise that we're losing data'. It is planned that many discs will be made, and there will be a space on the container for their 'caretakers' to etch their names</p> <p>Our generation is the first to be able to influence the climate, and the last to be free of the consequences. Or, as Daniel Hillis, creator of the Clock of the Long Now, puts it: 'In some sense, we've run out of our story, which was the story of taking power over nature. It's not that we've finished that, but we've gotten ahead of ourselves, and we don't know what the next story is after that.'</p> <p>Now and then, it might be good to slow down and ponder what comes next.</p> <p>\u0095 Visit <a href=\"http://www.longnow.org\" target=\"_NEW\">The Long Now</a> for more information.</p> <p><b>How to slow down</b></p> <p>\u0095 Make yourself eat breakfast</p> <p>\u0095 Skip the gym and go for a long walk</p> <p>\u0095 Take a lunch break</p> <p>\u0095 Buy a bicycle</p> <p>\u0095 Spend 10 minutes each day in silence</p> <p>\u0095 Cook real food</p> <p>\u0095 Switch off the TV, stretch out on the sofa and read - or listen to music</p> <p>\u0095 Write to friends, don't email</p> <p>\u0095 Take a bath instead of a shower</p>",

      "bodyText": "The alarm rings. You jump out of bed, get the kids up and shovel cereal down them while the radio announcer counts out the minutes: 7.32, 7.41. You run for the bus, wishing you could afford a taxi, making a mental note to buy something for supper that you can stick in the microwave. At the office, you press the 'doors close' button in the lift in the hope of shaving off another few seconds. You arrive with a cup of takeout coffee (you're too rushed to sit in a caf\u00e9 doing nothing), to find that you already have 10 emails, four voicemail messages and that your boss wants some figures, preferably yesterday. Speed is increasingly equated with efficiency. Every invention - mobiles, laptops, fast food - is designed to cut corners. Haste, once a vice, is a virtue. Klaus Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum, which met in Davos last week, says: 'We are moving from a world in which the big eat the small to a world in which the fast eat the slow.' But not everyone wants to negotiate the world at the speed of a silicon chip. Our full-throttle lives are beset by anxieties. Some of these are minor: is it worth spending an hour programming the speed-dial on the phone to save a couple of seconds every time we make a call? Others are more troubling. Writer and inventor Stewart Brand says: 'Civilisation is revving itself into a pathologically short attention span'. We are changing the earth more rapidly than we are understanding it, yet we are so buzzing with adrenaline that we have no mental energy left to contemplate the consequences. The sense that this is a stupid way to live is encouraging pockets of resistance and creating a movement for slowness. Its adherents may be coming from different directions, but they have similar ends. They want to eat slowly, to live in slow cities and to extend their horizons beyond the next set of quarterly figures or the next software upgrade. The movement's most potent symbol is a clock, now on show in the Science Museum in London. Two metres tall, with a face that could have come straight from the Middle Ages, its stack of cogs and wheels recalls eighteenth-century Longitude -type clocks. But the construction and the materials - tungsten carbide, metallic glass and synthetic sapphire - are pure turn-of-the millennium. This clock ticks once every 30 seconds, but keeps a deeper time measured not over days or even a year but with the precession of the stars - a cycle of 25,784 years. It is the Clock of the Long Now, named by Brian Eno, the musician and artist, one of a number of people behind it, who came up with the idea when he was living in New York. It struck him that for most people he met in the city, 'now' meant 'this week'. 'No one had any investment in any kind of future except their own, conceived in the narrowest of terms.\" 'Now' has contracted for all of us. As writer and consultant Esther Dyson suggests: 'On the stock exchange it's today, on the net it's a month, in fashion it's a season, in demographics a decade, in most companies it's the next quarter.' It's not difficult to understand why this has happened. Technology is setting the pace for human events. The fact that the computing power of a silicon chip doubles every 18 months means, for example, that analysing a complex geometrical problem, such as the three-dimensional airflows past a wing, would have taken many years with the most powerful computer available in the 1940s. By 1969, it would have taken two days, by 1976, four hours. Today it would need about 15 minutes. This has had a profound effect on the way we think. There seems no point in looking forward, because, even in five years, technology will have changed our lives out of recognition. In 1996, Eno and others, including Brand, Dyson, Danny Hillis, the designer of some of the world's fastest computers, and Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired, established the Long Now Foundation to try to extend the idea of 'now' and foster long-term responsibility. The foundation conceived of a clock that would keep time until AD11,999. Brand says: 'Ideally, it would do for thinking about time what the photographs of Earth from space have done for thinking about the environment.' The clock in the Science Museum is the first of four that are proposed, each double the size of the last. 'The display on the second clock probably won't be moving,' says Alexander Rose, director of the Long Now Foundation, the charitable trust behind the clock. 'A human being will be required to put it right, and then it will continue to work for one minute. The human will be the last stage in the mechanism.' The third clock will almost certainly be displayed in a city and the fourth - which may take more than a lifetime to complete - will be built into rock in Nevada. The foundation has bought a site in the Great Basin National Park, surrounded by 5,000 year-old Bristlecone trees, thought to be the oldest living organisms in the world. The four clocks may, as the foundation hopes, acquire a mythic power and encourage us to consider the future. But they are not going to do much about the whirl of the morning commute, the sense that our multitasking lives are measured out in nanoseconds (billionths of a second). For this, something closer to home is required. We don't pretend to be able to slow down the whole of life,' says Renato Sardo of Slow Food, 'but we do think it is possible to stop for a bit during the day. Slow rhythms at the table are better for health. Knowing where your food has come from is important psychologically. We are all going to the same place; it's better to get there slowly.' Slow Food began in 1986, when an Italian journalist, Carlo Petrini, was so affronted by the opening of a McDonald's in Rome that he decided something must be done to counter the homogenisation of culture and nuke-it-and-eat-it attitudes to food. The organisation now has 60,000 members in 45 countries. 'We work towards the rediscovery of the richness and aromas of local cuisines by opposing the levelling effect of the Fast Life,' claims its manifesto. 'People today want to buy fast, eat fast,' says Sardo. 'But fast food chains are a menace to local traditions and require a particular, industrialised method of production that treats the animal as a commodity. In Italy until recently, everyone had a link to the land. I am 30, and I am the last generation to see their mothers killing the rabbit.\" Wendy Fogarty runs the Greater London Slow Food convivium, or chapter, with 400 members (another 200 Slow Foodies are scattered across the rest of the country). Yesterday, the London Convivium met at a Knightsbridge restaurant to taste olive oils and to eat - slowly - a three-course lunch. As well as indulging, Slow Food supporters also campaign - against transgenic vines and for local and, especially, unpasteurised cheeses. 'We are absolutely against the idea that good food should only be available to a few,' says Fogarty. Indeed, in 1995, a decision was taken to spread the philosophy of cultural integrity beyond the affluent West. The Slow Food Foundation is now involved in removing mines from agricultural land in Nicaragua and training families to farm and vary their diet; and in Brazil it is providing patients with infectious diseases at a hospital with nutritious, locally produced food. But the Slow Foodies are likely to have an uphill struggle. Scientists announced last month that they are trying to breed genetically modified pigs that will get fatter faster: a sort of just-in-time pig. The Washington Post recently reported that Lipton is now marketing a tea bag that lets you brew iced tea without boiling a kettle - just add cold water. For breakfast, General Mills offers a Milk 'n' Cereal bar, with Cheerios on the outside and milk inside, a must for anyone too busy to pour the Cheerios into a bowl and get a carton out of the refrigerator. We are surrounded by devices designed to save us time, from express checkout queues to remote controls. But the result of this is, paradoxically, to make us more impatient. An American study has found that moving in and out of 'computer time' makes people intolerant of interruptions from colleagues who cannot move at the speed of software. David Cannon, a British researcher, surveyed university students and concluded that, used to technology and computer games, they have trouble focusing long and hard. A hectic life is not automatically filled with more pleasure and meaning. Racing through everything can leave you wondering what you have been too busy to notice, too preoccupied to savour. To counter this, in late 1999, 30 Italian towns designated themselves Slow Cities. 'The model given by America has invaded our cities and risks making Italy's towns look all the same. We need to stop this kind of colonisation,' says Paolo Saturnini, the mayor of Greve in Chianti. In common with the Slow Food movement, of which it is an offshoot, Slow Cities favour regional distinctiveness and sustained pleasure. They have yet to roll out to other parts of Europe, although the hope is that they will begin to do so this year. To qualify for Slow status, mayors and councils must permit more neighbourhood restaurants (osterie), ban neon signs, combat traffic and noise pollution, encourage cyclists, plant trees and maintain parks and squares. In his 1996 novel Slowness, Milan Kundera suggests that speed is associated with forgetting, slowness with remembering. Hurry sickness is endangering our culture, not least because technology keeps outrunning itself. Recent history is littered with the brand names of now-useless personal computers, from the Altair to the Yamaha CX5M. 'The years between 1950 and now will be seen as a dark age by future historians,' says Rose. 'Nasa has lost the first 20 years of its satellite data. Even if it could still be read, the magnetic tape it was stored on has deteriorated too badly. We are losing every bit of culture we are putting into digital storage.' In response, the Long Now Foundation is creating what it calls the Rosetta Disc - a 2.8-inch nickel disc capable of storing 30,000 pages of text. 'Being analogue, rather than ones and zeros, it doesn't have a platform-dependency problem,' says Rose. 'Language is the only platform-dependency, so we are including 1,000 translations of a single piece of text.' The text is the opening chapters of the Bible, the only work to have been translated so many times. Indigenous creation stories will be included on the disc, as will a list of 100 words that exist in every culture (sun, moon, you, me), from which, Rose says, it is possible to decode an entire language. The project has been funded from private donations, 'mostly from people in the technology sector, who have lived very fast-paced lives and realise that we're losing data'. It is planned that many discs will be made, and there will be a space on the container for their 'caretakers' to etch their names Our generation is the first to be able to influence the climate, and the last to be free of the consequences. Or, as Daniel Hillis, creator of the Clock of the Long Now, puts it: 'In some sense, we've run out of our story, which was the story of taking power over nature. It's not that we've finished that, but we've gotten ahead of ourselves, and we don't know what the next story is after that.' Now and then, it might be good to slow down and ponder what comes next. \u0095 Visit The Long Now for more information.

      "body": "<p>Jacqueline Davies, aged 60, is a handsome, outgoing woman who epitomises traditional middle England - diligent in her Christian faith; content and adept at keeping an immaculate home; stylish with a deprecating wit. She comes from a close, affluent family. In the early Sixties, she worked briefly for Jaeger in London. Then, she fell in love with Tom, a fighter pilot, and gave up work when she married at the age of 20. The two grew up together in Chalfont St Peters, Bucks. Their fathers had played in the village cricket team while their mothers made the tea. 'That's the kind of world we've always known,' Jacqueline says.</p> <p>She looked after their two children, Suzanne and Simon, while Tom worked as a senior pilot for British Airways. And so it might have continued happily ever after, except that, six years ago, on Monday, 17 July 1995, the couple received a telephone call that turned their lives upside down. 'We were pushed into a far darker and nastier place then we'd ever known,' Jacqueline says. 'I feel I've been emotionally raped .'</p> <p>Tom, a measured, courteous man, whose indulgencies are an elderly Porsche and a taste for good food and wine, had retired only three weeks prior to the call. 'We had plans to travel, to enjoy ourselves,' he says. 'I'd just asked Jacqueline, \"Well, where shall we go first - Scotland or the West Country?\" when the phone rang. I never have received an answer.' The call informed the Davieses that Suzanne, aged 32, had died in a fire in the Netherlands earlier that morning.</p> <p>Suzanne and her two-year-old daughter Charlotte had moved from London to Bousval in Belgium, the previous year, to live with Kevin 'Todd' Sweeney, an enigmatic Englishman who claimed to be a millionaire publisher. A year later, the couple bought a new house in Steensel across the border in Holland. The family had yet to move in, when, on a weekend visit to clean up, Suzanne died there alone, allegedly after falling asleep while smoking a cigarette in bed.</p> <p>She had only known Sweeney for 18 months. During that time, they had married and Suzanne had made four wills. She also acquired further life insurance. Alive, she had little; dead, she was worth a great deal. Precisely how much would not properly emerge until a year after Kevin Sweeney went on trial in the Netherlands for murder, arson and mortgage fraud.</p> <p>In September 1996, he appeared in court in s'Hertogenbosch before three judges. He pleaded not guilty, insisting that he had no motive for killing his wife since he stood to gain nothing financially, a view the prosecution failed to challenge. The forensic evidence also appeared contradictory. He was duly acquitted.</p> <p>This Tuesday, Sweeney, now aged 50 and remarried with a child, will go on trial for a second time. The Dutch system allows the prosecution to appeal against acquittal. Another trio of judges, again sitting without a jury, will examine fresh forensic evidence and reconsider the question of Sweeney's motive.</p> <p>His lawyer, Nico Meijering, is adamant that his client will again be acquitted. He has said that the police have built up a theory based on Sweeney's guilt and then looked for proof. Sweeney claims he is the victim of a giant conspiracy. Meijering anticipates an acquittal and a massive suit for damages. 'We are,' he says, 'supremely confident.'</p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the murder trial, it is Jacqueline Davies who, over the past six years, has shown extraordinary tenacity, and courage in the face of Sweeney's litigious bullying. It is Jacqueline who, with the able help of her lawyer Alison Meek, has revealed how potentially Sweeney stood to gain greatly from the death of his wife.</p> <p>It is Jacqueline who, since we first met in 1997, has been transformed into a dogged investigator, amateur lawyer and chief chronicler of the shadowy life and times of Kevin Sweeney, a man who, other have alleged, has for years moved around Europe, manipulating individuals and exploiting their vulnerabilities. Once Jacqueline Davies had walked into St Catherine's House in London, eight days after her daughter's funeral, to establish some facts about the history of her son-in-law, Sweeney's fairy tales were over.</p> <p>'He'd told Suzanne that his mother was a French aristocrat and that his father was a British diplomat. He'd told me he'd worked for the World Bank and had been a racing-car driver and that his brother was a monk,' Jacqueline explains. 'When we came to look him up among the births, marriages and deaths, we discovered that he simply didn't exist.</p> <p>'From then on, I was driven. It was a way of working through my grief. The more I found out, the better it has been. Some days, I've been clinging on by my finger tips - Suzanne and I were so close - but I've also known that I would never give up until we discovered the truth.'</p> <p>At the beginning of 1994, Suzanne Davies was living in a house in west London bought for her by her parents. She had been divorced twice; she had recovered from anorexia and she had become the mother of Charlotte. Suzanne had chosen not to disclose the identity of her daughter's father. 'She was the kind of person who always parked on double yellow lines,' says Jacqueline Davies.</p> <p>'Suzanne was no angel but she was warm and tactile and lovely. And she adored Charlotte. She wanted to find a family for her.'</p> <p>In February, Kevin Sweeney placed a lonely hearts ad in Private Eye: 'Incomplete single dad seeks single mum for friendship, mutual support and perhaps a chance to recapture a complete loving family. I am educated, cosmopolitan, confident, solvent, cheerful, witty, tender and fantastic with kids - and mums.</p> <p>Forty-eight women replied, one of whom was Suzanne. Sweeney explained that he lived abroad and that he had been widowed several months earlier, when Beverly, his English wife of eight years, had died unexpectedly, leaving two daughters under five. Suzanne was expensively wooed. By the spring, she had resigned from her \u00a330,000-a-year job as an advertising executive and moved to Belgium. 'I'm floating on air,' Suzanne wrote to her cousin.

They refused but the other details Sweeney had provided offered Jacqueline a clue. First, she traced his daughters' birth certificates, and then Sweeney's 1987 marriage certificate, which incorrectly recorded him as a bachelor. He had divorced his first wife, Lis Larsen, before marrying Beverly Flint.</p> <p>That, in turn, led to Sweeney's father, Denis, listed as a university lecturer (he was, in fact, an engineer in the Royal Marines, who had worked on the Indian railways) and to Beverly's father, David Flint. Jacqueline had learned that the Flints lived in Cambridgeshire. She asked a girl friend in the area to photocopy all the Flints in the phone book and so the correct Flints - David and Ellie - were eventually tracked down. 'Even Interpol hadn't been able to find them,' she says with some satisfaction.</p> <p>The Flints introduced Jacqueline to Chrissie Innes, a former employee and ex-girlfriend of Sweeney's, godmother to one of his children. Chrissie said Sweeney had a metal plate in his head from a car accident (he still has a silver badger streak which she says she used to dye), and that he was the son of a French aristocrat who had abandoned him when he was four.</p> <p>In truth, Kevin Sweeney was born in India, in Pune in 1950, which is why his birth was not registered in the UK. The family came to Britain in 1957 and his parents divorced 10 years later. Mrs Sweeney became a teacher and had two more children, both now scientists. She lives only a few miles from the Flints but for years knew nothing of her oldest son's marriages or his wives' deaths or even the existence of her grandchildren. She continues to have no contact. For reasons she wouldn't disclose to me, she said that for years she had pretended to friends that she had no older son.</p> <p>Jacqueline Davies also discovered that between Beverly Flint's death and Suzanne's arrival in Bousval, Sweeney had courted a woman called Chris Rowley. Rowley was 23 and an Australian archaeology student taking a year out. She was hired as a nanny by Sweeney in November 1993, three months after Beverly Flint's death.</p> <p>Within a few days, Rowley said Sweeney had bedded her and proposed. She accepted and worked for several months without pay. She says that he had a large collection of pornography and encouraged her to engage in sexual activity, including lesbian encounters. She alleges he suggested that she take out a large life-insurance policy. 'I told him not to be so silly. He was 20 years older than me; he was bound to die first.'</p> <p>At Christmas, Chris Rowley says Sweeney told her he was terminally ill with a brain tumour (he has allegedly suffered from a brain tumour many times over the years). On 1 April 1995, Rowley was on a plane back to Australia. 'I was too bolshie for him,' she subsequently commented. Jacqueline Davies says: 'I've no doubt that Sweeney selected Suzanne for her vulnerability. Outwardly, she appeared confident. Inside, she was marshmallow.'</p> <p>Beverly Flint, Sweeney's second wife, had lived with him in East Anglia, Denmark, Holland and Belgium. Her family also speak of Sweeney's fables. Once, he reported he was staying overnight in hospital for heart tests. Beverly's father, David Flint, pressed 1471 to learn that Sweeney was calling from the local pizzeria.</p> <p>On 29 August 1993, in Bousval, Beverly, aged 33, walked into the garden to feed her Siamese cats - and dropped dead. The doctor decided the cause was heart failure, unusual in a woman who is three months pregnant since increased oestrogen levels provide a natural protection. She was cremated shortly after and, under Belgian law, there was no requirement for a post-mortem.</p> <p>Beverly left everything to her two children with her husband as sole trustee. The house in Bousval had been bought in her name secured by a life policy worth \u00a3240,000. The will was allegedly witnessed by Chrissie Innes and her husband, Simon and dated 29 September 1991. Chrissie subsequently said that she had witnessed the will only after Beverly's death. Sweeney had told her that if she didn't, the Belgian government would take the girls' money in tax.</p> <p>'It's the truth and I can't change it, however unpalatable, however embarrassing, however much Sweeney might now want me to retract,' she explains now. 'I did what I thought was right for the girls.'</p> <p>Sweeney is a man of formidable intellect with a self-taught knowledge of the law (partially gained during eight months on remand) and a gargantuan appetite for litigation. He always represents himself as 'a litigant in person', incurring few costs himself, but forcing others who may not be eligible for legal aid to mount up legal fees. 'In 12 years as a lawyer,' says Alison Meek, the solicitor and trust litigator who successfully recently outmanoeuvred him in the British courts, 'I've never had an adversary like him nor had so much acrimony directed at me personally.'</p> <p>A partner with Boodle Hatfield, a blue-chip firm better known for its relation ship with the Grosvenor Estates, Meek was eventually served on Sweeney's instigation with a writ for criminal contempt, an imprisonable offence, an action, a judge later described as 'a disgrace'.</p> <p>In Holland, Sweeney has had access to all the witness statements taken during police inquiries. He has used this material, privileged in British law, to issue more than 50 criminal and civil summonses alleging, among other charges, malicious defamation, perjury and the fabrication of evidence. Two dozen individuals have been targeted, including Chrissie Innes, Tom and Jacqueline Davies and their son, Simon, who briefly worked with Sweeney; friends of Suzanne and the Dutch police. 'What he has effectively tried to do,' says one of the recipients of his many writs, 'is to use the law to intimidate.'</p> <p>Sweeney has also engaged in a separate gruelling five-year series of legal battles with Tom and Jacqueline Davies. Initially, this was to win custody of Charlotte and, latterly, to fight off the Davieses' attempts to remove him as the sole trustee of Suzanne's insurance policies. Mr Justice Jonathan Parker, in April 1998, undaunted by Sweeney's not untypical 1,400 page affidavit, rambling allegations and prevarications, decided that 'Mr Sweeney is a man with no scruples when it comes to concealing the truth and presenting a false picture.'</p> <p>Seven months later, the judge took the rare step of banning Sweeney from initiating any further legal action without leave of the chancery court, using an obscure nineteenth-century case called Grepe v Loam as precedent. In effect, it means that Sweeney has been labelled a 'vexatious litigant'. The judge said Sweeney had conducted 'a prolonged campaign of harassment and vilification against [Charlotte's] family and advisers'.</p> <p>An earlier example of this occurred only four months after Suzanne's death. Sweeney made the absurd claim through the courts that Charlotte was his natural child. The Davies, who now have wardship, requested a DNA test. It proved he was not. Jacqueline had by now also begun to track down her daughter's several policies, eventually worth, in total, almost \u00a3635,000. She pressed the Official Solicitor to stop the insurance companies paying out to Sweeney since Suzanne had stipulated that she wanted the money divided between 'my three girls'. As the sole trustee living outside the jurisdiction of the British courts, once the policies had been paid to Sweeney, it would have been extremely difficult to recover the money.</p> <p>On 21 July 1995, Sweeney had instructed his solicitor in Oxfordshire, Tim Morton of Lightfoots, to administer his wife's estate. In an affidavit, Morton later said: 'On no occasion during the administration of the estate has Mr Sweeney ever expressed an intention to benefit himself under the will of his wife.' In March 1997, Black Horse Financial Services paid \u00a3126,000 life insurance and interest secured on the house in Thame to Morton who sent it to Sweeney as executor and trustee. All three children had by then been placed in the care of their respective grandparents. Sweeney has still not passed on this money to the children.</p> <p>In September 1997, the Davieses took steps to remove Sweeney as a trustee and replace him with the Official Solicitor to act on behalf of the girls. It was a gamble. If the Davieses lost the case, they would have had to pay more than \u00a3100,000; if they won, legal costs would be paid out of the interest accrued on the policies and the money would finally be available to the girls .</p> <p>Sweeney again represented himself. As he lost one action after another, the self-styled millionaire claimed that he had no funds to meet the escalating costs. He also suggested that the Royal Life policies should become void because of Suzanne's alleged 'suicidal tendencies'. As Mr Justice Jonathan Parker pointed out in his judgment, this revealed Sweeney's conflict of interest. Suicide could be 'a defence to a possible murder charge'. It apparently no longer mattered to Sweeney that this would also mean three children forfeiting their money.</p> <p>'His actions were part of a three-pronged strategy,' says Alison Meek. 'The first part was to run up massive legal costs for my clients. The second was to ensure that if the Royal voided the policies, my clients would have to pay the substantial legal costs of litigation themselves. Many clients would find the prospect of costs on that scale too daunting to even consider but the Davieses were totally determined. A third prong was to harass me personally and professionally by accusing me of the serious charge of criminal contempt.'</p> <p>Mr Justice Parker also criticised Sweeney's attempt to move the trust to the Cayman Islands, 'as far as possible from the control of the English courts'. Sweeney was removed as trustee but then lodged an appeal. The appeal was dismissed and he was ordered to pay costs of \u00a3110,000. He has yet to produce the money, but the Official Solicitor does now have the cash from the Royal Life policies in trust for the three girls.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, the decision on Kevin Sweeney's guilt or innocence is due a fortnight after Tuesday's court appearance. If he is acquitted, he will have spent years in limbo, living with the threat of criminal prosecution. If guilty, he faces a prison sentence of up to 15 years with leave to appeal. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard continues to pursue the issue of Beverly Flint's allegedly forged will.</p> <p>Sweeney's case in Holland raises several questions pertinent to Britain. For instance, the issue of whether an individual should be tried twice for the same crime. Next month, the Law Commission is due to deliver its inquiry into the question of whether double jeopardy should be abandoned in certain circumstances in the British courts. It is rumoured that the commission may recommend its abandonment in cases of murder.</p> <p>Sweeney's case also highlights what some lawyers say is an epidemic of 'vexatious litigators' - those who eat away at their opponents' time, finances and mental stability by issuing writ after writ, at a minimal outlay to themselves. The Davieses are constituents of John Bercow, Conservative MP for Buckingham. He now plans to raise the issue in the House of Commons and seek an adjournment debate on how action can be taken while preserving the principle that everyone is entitled to their day in court.</p> <p>Tomorrow, it is Charlotte's ninth birthday. She has lived with her grandparents for almost six years and still, on occasions, grieves for her mother terribly. It is also the day that the Davieses must fly to Holland. 'I have no desire for revenge,' Jacqueline says. 'All I've ever sought is justice.'</p> <p>She produces one of Suzanne's poems. 'My mother means so much to me,' Jacqueline reads. 'One day I will be there for her/helping, pushing, pulling, whatever it takes to repay a love so large/given with nothing expected in return. What is my mother?/She is love.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jacqueline Davies, aged 60, is a handsome, outgoing woman who epitomises traditional middle England - diligent in her Christian faith; content and adept at keeping an immaculate home; stylish with a deprecating wit. She comes from a close, affluent family. In the early Sixties, she worked briefly for Jaeger in London. Then, she fell in love with Tom, a fighter pilot, and gave up work when she married at the age of 20. The two grew up together in Chalfont St Peters, Bucks. Their fathers had played in the village cricket team while their mothers made the tea. 'That's the kind of world we've always known,' Jacqueline says. She looked after their two children, Suzanne and Simon, while Tom worked as a senior pilot for British Airways. And so it might have continued happily ever after, except that, six years ago, on Monday, 17 July 1995, the couple received a telephone call that turned their lives upside down. 'We were pushed into a far darker and nastier place then we'd ever known,' Jacqueline says. 'I feel I've been emotionally raped .' Tom, a measured, courteous man, whose indulgencies are an elderly Porsche and a taste for good food and wine, had retired only three weeks prior to the call. 'We had plans to travel, to enjoy ourselves,' he says. 'I'd just asked Jacqueline, \"Well, where shall we go first - Scotland or the West Country?\" when the phone rang. I never have received an answer.' The call informed the Davieses that Suzanne, aged 32, had died in a fire in the Netherlands earlier that morning. Suzanne and her two-year-old daughter Charlotte had moved from London to Bousval in Belgium, the previous year, to live with Kevin 'Todd' Sweeney, an enigmatic Englishman who claimed to be a millionaire publisher. A year later, the couple bought a new house in Steensel across the border in Holland. The family had yet to move in, when, on a weekend visit to clean up, Suzanne died there alone, allegedly after falling asleep while smoking a cigarette in bed. She had only known Sweeney for 18 months. During that time, they had married and Suzanne had made four wills. She also acquired further life insurance. Alive, she had little; dead, she was worth a great deal. Precisely how much would not properly emerge until a year after Kevin Sweeney went on trial in the Netherlands for murder, arson and mortgage fraud. In September 1996, he appeared in court in s'Hertogenbosch before three judges. He pleaded not guilty, insisting that he had no motive for killing his wife since he stood to gain nothing financially, a view the prosecution failed to challenge. The forensic evidence also appeared contradictory. He was duly acquitted. This Tuesday, Sweeney, now aged 50 and remarried with a child, will go on trial for a second time. The Dutch system allows the prosecution to appeal against acquittal. Another trio of judges, again sitting without a jury, will examine fresh forensic evidence and reconsider the question of Sweeney's motive. His lawyer, Nico Meijering, is adamant that his client will again be acquitted. He has said that the police have built up a theory based on Sweeney's guilt and then looked for proof. Sweeney claims he is the victim of a giant conspiracy. Meijering anticipates an acquittal and a massive suit for damages. 'We are,' he says, 'supremely confident.' Whatever the outcome of the murder trial, it is Jacqueline Davies who, over the past six years, has shown extraordinary tenacity, and courage in the face of Sweeney's litigious bullying. It is Jacqueline who, with the able help of her lawyer Alison Meek, has revealed how potentially Sweeney stood to gain greatly from the death of his wife. It is Jacqueline who, since we first met in 1997, has been transformed into a dogged investigator, amateur lawyer and chief chronicler of the shadowy life and times of Kevin Sweeney, a man who, other have alleged, has for years moved around Europe, manipulating individuals and exploiting their vulnerabilities. Once Jacqueline Davies had walked into St Catherine's House in London, eight days after her daughter's funeral, to establish some facts about the history of her son-in-law, Sweeney's fairy tales were over. 'He'd told Suzanne that his mother was a French aristocrat and that his father was a British diplomat. He'd told me he'd worked for the World Bank and had been a racing-car driver and that his brother was a monk,' Jacqueline explains. 'When we came to look him up among the births, marriages and deaths, we discovered that he simply didn't exist. 'From then on, I was driven. It was a way of working through my grief. The more I found out, the better it has been. Some days, I've been clinging on by my finger tips - Suzanne and I were so close - but I've also known that I would never give up until we discovered the truth.' At the beginning of 1994, Suzanne Davies was living in a house in west London bought for her by her parents. She had been divorced twice; she had recovered from anorexia and she had become the mother of Charlotte. Suzanne had chosen not to disclose the identity of her daughter's father. 'She was the kind of person who always parked on double yellow lines,' says Jacqueline Davies. 'Suzanne was no angel but she was warm and tactile and lovely. And she adored Charlotte. She wanted to find a family for her.' In February, Kevin Sweeney placed a lonely hearts ad in Private Eye: 'Incomplete single dad seeks single mum for friendship, mutual support and perhaps a chance to recapture a complete loving family. I am educated, cosmopolitan, confident, solvent, cheerful, witty, tender and fantastic with kids - and mums. Forty-eight women replied, one of whom was Suzanne. Sweeney explained that he lived abroad and that he had been widowed several months earlier, when Beverly, his English wife of eight years, had died unexpectedly, leaving two daughters under five. Suzanne was expensively wooed. By the spring, she had resigned from her \u00a330,000-a-year job as an advertising executive and moved to Belgium. 'I'm floating on air,' Suzanne wrote to her cousin. 'I'm so very happy.' The house in Bousval was isolated and had extensive internal close-circuit television cameras connected to monitors on Sweeney's desk. Phone calls were often taped and the children were rarely allowed out. Sweeney was 'associated' with a company called Battlefield which Suzanne ran, selling business information. Sweeney paid Suzanne \u00a36,600 a month. But friends report that her confidence, always fragile, quickly began to crumble. She appeared withdrawn and unhappy. Just before her death, she complained of blacking out and 'losing hours'. Sweeney, who allegedly enjoys pornography such as The Story of O, a sadomasochistic fantasy, introduced Suzanne to the sex clubs of Amsterdam as he had done his previous lovers. On several occasions, she announced her intention to leave, 'but it was her third marriage,' one friend explains. 'She had a lot invested.' 'Pray for me, Mummy,' Suzanne said on the phone to Jacqueline on one occasion. 'Pray for me.' Sweeney has said that Suzanne was 'an obsessive compulsive' who was far from stable. Jacqueline Davies says she cut short her first visit to Bousval because she found Sweeney cold and emotionally manipulative. 'When I came back, I said to Tom, \"What on earth are we going to do?\"' A year before meeting Sweeney, Suzanne, on her mother's advice, had taken out one life insurance policy worth \u00a3100,000 with Royal Life Insurance for the benefit of Charlotte. In November 1994, Suzanne and Sweeney were married. She spent the final eight months of her life remarkably concerned with her financial affairs. In January 1995, she took out a second policy with Royal Life worth \u00a3200,000, as did he. In April, Suzanne bought the house in Steensel in Holland, secured by a life policy worth \u00a3220,000 taken out with ABN Amro, and a house in Thame in Oxfordshire secured with a life policy worth \u00a3115,000 with Black Horse Insurance. Jacqueline Davies queried how her daughter could keep up the mortgages. Suzanne told her 'Toddie' would give her the money. Suzanne claimed she'd worked for a Dutch company, Omniscience, on an annual salary of \u00a3120,416 in the capacity of sales director. Accounts for the company were fake. Sweeney's lawyer says his client knew nothing of this. Suzanne shopped with her mother in Britain for her new Dutch home. 'I wondered why she was buying at MFI, if he was a millionaire. It seemed so cheap. As soon as I saw the house, I knew that Sweeney would never live in it,' Jacqueline adds. 'It was near a roundabout on a busy main road. Sweeney liked isolation.' On the weekend of her death, seven days after her thirty-second birthday, Suzanne and Sweeney had arranged to take a romantic break. A nanny cared for the children in Bousval and Sweeney and Suzanne stayed in Brussels on Friday night. He was due in Frankfurt on business the next day so Suzanne arranged to meet him on Saturday evening in Amsterdam. But that afternoon, having cancelled his meeting without telling his wife, Sweeney rented an Opel-Astra and returned alone to Bousval. He then drove to the Steensel house. He arrived in the late afternoon. He says he deposited truffles and 'computer equipment' and eventually reached Amsterdam at nine at night. Having not known his whereabouts Suzanne had placed several irate phone calls to Bousval. The couple drove separately to Steensel the following night - Suzanne's last.

The time he left varies in his statements between 1.30am and 2.30am. The journey takes roughly 110 minutes and the nanny reported him back by 4.30 am. A burglar alarm which melted in the blaze in the Steensel house times the outbreak of fire at 2.37 am precisely so it is possible that Sweeney was still in the house when the fire began. It had smouldered for more than an hour before the fire brigade was called. Strangely, on a warm evening, Suzanne had slept with the windows closed and a duvet on the bed. One side of the bed was badly burnt. Her body was found crouched, face down, in the adjacent dressing-room. She had suffocated. A cigarette packet and a lighter were near the bed. Several bottles of cleaning fluid, turpentine or white spirit, some in the bedroom, some in the bathroom, were found. An intact paraffin bottle was on the landing. Laboratory analysis indicated the presence of 'turpentine' in eight locations around the bedroom. The defence claimed that firemen had spread the cleaning fluid when they'd entered the room. The Metropolitan Police commissioned their own forensic study from Andrew Wade. He concluded that there had been a separate seat of fire in the hall outside the closed bedroom door. Wade's evidence was ruled inadmissible. The defence argued that Suzanne could have lost her life through smoking in bed. The prosecution and defence in the new trial have both commissioned new forensic reports. After Suzanne's death, Dutch and British police and Interpol proceeded to attempt to piece together Sweeney's interests in Europe, Britain and the USA. They found more than 30 companies, among them Pure Data and Data Group Association, with which he had a connection. These companies recruited clients mainly by mail shot who paid up to \u00a36,000 for a package of computer-generated economic information. Investigators could find little concrete evidence of his alleged millionaire status. Tapes from his house in Bousval illustrate how he has also used a number of aliases, among them Hendrick Pold, Edouard Oban and Simon Lister.

At Christmas, Chris Rowley says Sweeney told her he was terminally ill with a brain tumour (he has allegedly suffered from a brain tumour many times over the years). On 1 April 1995, Rowley was on a plane back to Australia. 'I was too bolshie for him,' she subsequently commented. Jacqueline Davies says: 'I've no doubt that Sweeney selected Suzanne for her vulnerability. Outwardly, she appeared confident. Inside, she was marshmallow.' Beverly Flint, Sweeney's second wife, had lived with him in East Anglia, Denmark, Holland and Belgium. Her family also speak of Sweeney's fables. Once, he reported he was staying overnight in hospital for heart tests. Beverly's father, David Flint, pressed 1471 to learn that Sweeney was calling from the local pizzeria. On 29 August 1993, in Bousval, Beverly, aged 33, walked into the garden to feed her Siamese cats - and dropped dead. The doctor decided the cause was heart failure, unusual in a woman who is three months pregnant since increased oestrogen levels provide a natural protection. She was cremated shortly after and, under Belgian law, there was no requirement for a post-mortem. Beverly left everything to her two children with her husband as sole trustee. The house in Bousval had been bought in her name secured by a life policy worth \u00a3240,000. The will was allegedly witnessed by Chrissie Innes and her husband, Simon and dated 29 September 1991. Chrissie subsequently said that she had witnessed the will only after Beverly's death. Sweeney had told her that if she didn't, the Belgian government would take the girls' money in tax. 'It's the truth and I can't change it, however unpalatable, however embarrassing, however much Sweeney might now want me to retract,' she explains now. 'I did what I thought was right for the girls.' Sweeney is a man of formidable intellect with a self-taught knowledge of the law (partially gained during eight months on remand) and a gargantuan appetite for litigation. He always represents himself as 'a litigant in person', incurring few costs himself, but forcing others who may not be eligible for legal aid to mount up legal fees. 'In 12 years as a lawyer,' says Alison Meek, the solicitor and trust litigator who successfully recently outmanoeuvred him in the British courts, 'I've never had an adversary like him nor had so much acrimony directed at me personally.' A partner with Boodle Hatfield, a blue-chip firm better known for its relation ship with the Grosvenor Estates, Meek was eventually served on Sweeney's instigation with a writ for criminal contempt, an imprisonable offence, an action, a judge later described as 'a disgrace'. In Holland, Sweeney has had access to all the witness statements taken during police inquiries. He has used this material, privileged in British law, to issue more than 50 criminal and civil summonses alleging, among other charges, malicious defamation, perjury and the fabrication of evidence. Two dozen individuals have been targeted, including Chrissie Innes, Tom and Jacqueline Davies and their son, Simon, who briefly worked with Sweeney; friends of Suzanne and the Dutch police. 'What he has effectively tried to do,' says one of the recipients of his many writs, 'is to use the law to intimidate.' Sweeney has also engaged in a separate gruelling five-year series of legal battles with Tom and Jacqueline Davies. Initially, this was to win custody of Charlotte and, latterly, to fight off the Davieses' attempts to remove him as the sole trustee of Suzanne's insurance policies. Mr Justice Jonathan Parker, in April 1998, undaunted by Sweeney's not untypical 1,400 page affidavit, rambling allegations and prevarications, decided that 'Mr Sweeney is a man with no scruples when it comes to concealing the truth and presenting a false picture.' Seven months later, the judge took the rare step of banning Sweeney from initiating any further legal action without leave of the chancery court, using an obscure nineteenth-century case called Grepe v Loam as precedent. In effect, it means that Sweeney has been labelled a 'vexatious litigant'. The judge said Sweeney had conducted 'a prolonged campaign of harassment and vilification against [Charlotte's] family and advisers'. An earlier example of this occurred only four months after Suzanne's death. Sweeney made the absurd claim through the courts that Charlotte was his natural child. The Davies, who now have wardship, requested a DNA test. It proved he was not. Jacqueline had by now also begun to track down her daughter's several policies, eventually worth, in total, almost \u00a3635,000. She pressed the Official Solicitor to stop the insurance companies paying out to Sweeney since Suzanne had stipulated that she wanted the money divided between 'my three girls'. As the sole trustee living outside the jurisdiction of the British courts, once the policies had been paid to Sweeney, it would have been extremely difficult to recover the money. On 21 July 1995, Sweeney had instructed his solicitor in Oxfordshire, Tim Morton of Lightfoots, to administer his wife's estate. In an affidavit, Morton later said: 'On no occasion during the administration of the estate has Mr Sweeney ever expressed an intention to benefit himself under the will of his wife.' In March 1997, Black Horse Financial Services paid \u00a3126,000 life insurance and interest secured on the house in Thame to Morton who sent it to Sweeney as executor and trustee. All three children had by then been placed in the care of their respective grandparents. Sweeney has still not passed on this money to the children. In September 1997, the Davieses took steps to remove Sweeney as a trustee and replace him with the Official Solicitor to act on behalf of the girls. It was a gamble. If the Davieses lost the case, they would have had to pay more than \u00a3100,000; if they won, legal costs would be paid out of the interest accrued on the policies and the money would finally be available to the girls . Sweeney again represented himself. As he lost one action after another, the self-styled millionaire claimed that he had no funds to meet the escalating costs. He also suggested that the Royal Life policies should become void because of Suzanne's alleged 'suicidal tendencies'. As Mr Justice Jonathan Parker pointed out in his judgment, this revealed Sweeney's conflict of interest. Suicide could be 'a defence to a possible murder charge'. It apparently no longer mattered to Sweeney that this would also mean three children forfeiting their money. 'His actions were part of a three-pronged strategy,' says Alison Meek. 'The first part was to run up massive legal costs for my clients. The second was to ensure that if the Royal voided the policies, my clients would have to pay the substantial legal costs of litigation themselves. Many clients would find the prospect of costs on that scale too daunting to even consider but the Davieses were totally determined. A third prong was to harass me personally and professionally by accusing me of the serious charge of criminal contempt.' Mr Justice Parker also criticised Sweeney's attempt to move the trust to the Cayman Islands, 'as far as possible from the control of the English courts'. Sweeney was removed as trustee but then lodged an appeal. The appeal was dismissed and he was ordered to pay costs of \u00a3110,000. He has yet to produce the money, but the Official Solicitor does now have the cash from the Royal Life policies in trust for the three girls. In the Netherlands, the decision on Kevin Sweeney's guilt or innocence is due a fortnight after Tuesday's court appearance. If he is acquitted, he will have spent years in limbo, living with the threat of criminal prosecution. If guilty, he faces a prison sentence of up to 15 years with leave to appeal. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard continues to pursue the issue of Beverly Flint's allegedly forged will. Sweeney's case in Holland raises several questions pertinent to Britain. For instance, the issue of whether an individual should be tried twice for the same crime. Next month, the Law Commission is due to deliver its inquiry into the question of whether double jeopardy should be abandoned in certain circumstances in the British courts. It is rumoured that the commission may recommend its abandonment in cases of murder. Sweeney's case also highlights what some lawyers say is an epidemic of 'vexatious litigators' - those who eat away at their opponents' time, finances and mental stability by issuing writ after writ, at a minimal outlay to themselves. The Davieses are constituents of John Bercow, Conservative MP for Buckingham. He now plans to raise the issue in the House of Commons and seek an adjournment debate on how action can be taken while preserving the principle that everyone is entitled to their day in court. Tomorrow, it is Charlotte's ninth birthday. She has lived with her grandparents for almost six years and still, on occasions, grieves for her mother terribly. It is also the day that the Davieses must fly to Holland. 'I have no desire for revenge,' Jacqueline says. 'All I've ever sought is justice.' She produces one of Suzanne's poems. 'My mother means so much to me,' Jacqueline reads. 'One day I will be there for her/helping, pushing, pulling, whatever it takes to repay a love so large/given with nothing expected in return. What is my mother?/She is love.'",

The film's cameraman, Fritz Arno Wagner (Cary Elwes), laboriously explains to his professional colleagues that if he undercranks the camera the result is slow motion. The makers seem to believe the myth that silent films were scratchy, grainy and ill-focused when in fact they were more beautiful than most films we see today.

She didn't play safe when it came to marriage, however: she and her husband met and got engaged in three-and-a-half hours: 'We danced and chatted a bit at a New Year's dance. He said \"I'm going to marry you,\" and I said \"Yes, I know.\".' Now that her two children are grown up, she does not have to worry about mouths to feed. Her long working days are more a result of being energetic and driven. She denies being a workaholic. 'We also go to the theatre a lot, see heaps of the children, play tennis and like to dance. We entertain, enjoy bridge. I enjoy being busy.'",

      "body": "<p>The first quarter of each calendar year is peak season for savers to buy collective investments, as the 5 April deadline for using your annual tax-free Isa entitlement looms. </p> <p>But there are always clear winners and losers among the fund managers selling unit and investment trust Isas. Those selling funds with particularly trendy investment methods and objectives usually expect to be among the winners. This season's fashion is for funds that invest on the basis of international themes, and advisers expect several recently launched examples to be bestsellers. </p> <p>In this year's Isa season. investors who are slaves to fashion run risks, of course. The most obvious is that fashions can change at the drop of a hat, in which case your fund might fall from grace very quickly. But global-themed funds do have genuine merits. </p> <p>Given the lacklustre state of most world stock markets and the prospect of slower economic growth, it is hard to know which country or sector will produce the best returns over the coming months. And themed fund managers say their approach means you do not have to try. </p> <p>Not that there is anything new about international funds. UK investors have long been encouraged to diversify into overseas stock markets through general international or country-specific funds. Themed funds that focus on particular industries such as mining and commodities, utilities and the environmental sector have also been around for years. </p> <p>By combining these approaches, the global-themed funds claim to be able to achieve a higher rate of growth than an ordinary international fund, but without the restrictions of single-theme funds, which are so vulnerable to fickle fashion. </p> <p>Guy Monson, chief investment officer at Sarasin Investment Management, was a UK pioneer of this approach. 'The traditional method of running international funds was for country asset allocations to take priority over stock selection,' he says. But this was no longer delivering results as countries' economies became more alike, and conventional stock market sectors were not accurately reflecting what leading companies were doing, because these firms were involved in a wide range of activities. </p> <p>'A different approach was needed. That was when people started to look at the strategies of the world's most successful companies, such as General Electric, and saw that they no longer ran their businesses on a country-by-country basis. </p> <p>'If they were ignoring national boundaries, why shouldn't money managers?' Monson says. </p> <p>The result was a strategy of seeking long-term themes, or 'mega-trends', which are not specific to one region or market, and investing in firms that best represent them. In some cases, this involves investing in specific industries, while in others it means putting money into firms likely to benefit from global developments such as information technology. </p> <p>This was Monson's approach when he set up the EquiSar fund in 1994 and one he is still pursuing. A theme, he says, is a 'dynamic global trend that stimulates corporate earnings growth and drives up stock prices'. </p> <p>He focuses now on five themes of global significance. They are: e-commerce and the way the internet can benefit old-economy companies by helping them to expand and cut costs; opportunities for hardware and software companies; firms' pricing power and the way some can maintain a strong position and stable profit margins despite deregulation and pressure from rivals; energy, with the emphasis on demand for oil; and corporate restructuring and the need to provide greater shareholder value. </p> <p>These themes are not set in stone. Monson has already dumped one of his early choices - the emerging consumer. </p> <p>'The idea was to gain exposure to companies benefiting from the increasing affluence among the middle classes in the emerging markets of Asia, but the downturn in these countries proved much longer and deeper than expected, so that theme was dropped. </p> <p>In 1997, Invesco launched its Global Dynamic Themes fund. It picked seven 'dynamic' ones: technology, consumer products and services, telecoms, healthcare, financial services, natural resources and infrastructure. </p> <p>The fund's manager, Andrew Callender, assesses the relative strengths of these themes and identifies the best firms in the most attractive groups. </p> <p>But it was the boom in technology stocks in late 1999 that persuaded other managers to follow the lead of Sarasin and Invesco. The far-reaching impact of the internet has made everyone aware of globalisation, and several managers now see a market for funds with a wider thematic remit. </p> <p>Launches last year included Merrill Lynch's Global Titans fund, Framlington New Leaders and Aberdeen Global Champions. The names imply that they simply focus on big-name multinationals, but the managers' starting point is a theme. </p> <p>Rupert Della-Porter, senior fund manager at Aberdeen, says: 'Our investment strategy has three main pillars: globalisation, communication and innovation. Within each of these are various sub-sectors. In the case of globalisation, there is energy and wealth management, while communication includes telecoms and media.' </p> <p>Framlington's Lesley Hankin concentrates on seven sectors he believes are 'set to dominate growth prospects across the world economy'. They include healthcare, financial services, the internet, technology, the media, telecoms and leisure. </p> <p>'From these, we will target between 50 and 70 leading companies,' Hankin says. </p> <p>At Merrill Lynch, Neil Beaton is targeting fast-growing companies in 10 major global sectors. </p> <p>'We believe one or two companies will end up dominating in each industry and these are the companies we want to back,' Beaton says. </p> <p>The fund has focused on energy, fee-based financial services companies, defensive growth stocks such as food and drug retailers, healthcare and certain technology stocks. In contrast, it is underweight in industrial firms, utilities, financials, telecoms, demand-sensitive consumer goods and technology stocks such as PC manufacturers. </p> <p>Most of the stocks in the Merrill Lynch fund are blue chips such as General Electric, Pfizer and Vodafone, though Beaton says the team is looking for tomorrow's 'titans' as well as today's. </p> <p>Beaton says: 'We believe large companies can be as well-run as small ones providing they have the right management.' </p> <p>Another feature that distinguishes global theme funds is that they tend to hold no more than 60 to 80 stocks, compared with the 100 or more that the typical international fund might back at any one time. </p> <p>This concentration can boost returns but it means performance is likely to be more volatile. This is partly why independent financial advisers have mixed views about these funds. </p> <p>Haydn Green of the Nottingham-based Isa Shop believes investors are better off with conventional international funds, which have more freedom of choice. </p> <p>'A good international fund manager will already be investing in companies that represent these themes as well as having access to boring old-economy stocks,' Greden says. 'I think the funds are a pure gimmick and it is a pity investment groups resort to these methods to get investors to part with their money.' </p> <p>Clive Scott-Hopkins of IFA Towry Law only partly shares this view: 'Managers of successful international funds, such as the Foreign &amp; Colonial and Witan investment trusts, would argue they have been investing in the world's top companies for years. However, theme funds still have a part to play. Many UK investors do not have enough invested overseas and if these modern-sounding funds encourage them to do so, that is a good.' </p> <p>Pascal Matic of IFA Unitas believes the funds are a good idea but advises investors to choose managers carefully. He particularly favours the pioneer, Sarasin EquiSar. </p> <p>But he warns: 'One potential pitfall with this type of fund is there is no disciplined portfolio spread as with an international fund that has a specific benchmark.

      "bodyText": "The first quarter of each calendar year is peak season for savers to buy collective investments, as the 5 April deadline for using your annual tax-free Isa entitlement looms. But there are always clear winners and losers among the fund managers selling unit and investment trust Isas. Those selling funds with particularly trendy investment methods and objectives usually expect to be among the winners. This season's fashion is for funds that invest on the basis of international themes, and advisers expect several recently launched examples to be bestsellers. In this year's Isa season. investors who are slaves to fashion run risks, of course. The most obvious is that fashions can change at the drop of a hat, in which case your fund might fall from grace very quickly. But global-themed funds do have genuine merits. Given the lacklustre state of most world stock markets and the prospect of slower economic growth, it is hard to know which country or sector will produce the best returns over the coming months. And themed fund managers say their approach means you do not have to try. Not that there is anything new about international funds. UK investors have long been encouraged to diversify into overseas stock markets through general international or country-specific funds. Themed funds that focus on particular industries such as mining and commodities, utilities and the environmental sector have also been around for years. By combining these approaches, the global-themed funds claim to be able to achieve a higher rate of growth than an ordinary international fund, but without the restrictions of single-theme funds, which are so vulnerable to fickle fashion. Guy Monson, chief investment officer at Sarasin Investment Management, was a UK pioneer of this approach. 'The traditional method of running international funds was for country asset allocations to take priority over stock selection,' he says. But this was no longer delivering results as countries' economies became more alike, and conventional stock market sectors were not accurately reflecting what leading companies were doing, because these firms were involved in a wide range of activities. 'A different approach was needed. That was when people started to look at the strategies of the world's most successful companies, such as General Electric, and saw that they no longer ran their businesses on a country-by-country basis. 'If they were ignoring national boundaries, why shouldn't money managers?' Monson says. The result was a strategy of seeking long-term themes, or 'mega-trends', which are not specific to one region or market, and investing in firms that best represent them. In some cases, this involves investing in specific industries, while in others it means putting money into firms likely to benefit from global developments such as information technology. This was Monson's approach when he set up the EquiSar fund in 1994 and one he is still pursuing. A theme, he says, is a 'dynamic global trend that stimulates corporate earnings growth and drives up stock prices'. He focuses now on five themes of global significance. They are: e-commerce and the way the internet can benefit old-economy companies by helping them to expand and cut costs; opportunities for hardware and software companies; firms' pricing power and the way some can maintain a strong position and stable profit margins despite deregulation and pressure from rivals; energy, with the emphasis on demand for oil; and corporate restructuring and the need to provide greater shareholder value. These themes are not set in stone. Monson has already dumped one of his early choices - the emerging consumer. 'The idea was to gain exposure to companies benefiting from the increasing affluence among the middle classes in the emerging markets of Asia, but the downturn in these countries proved much longer and deeper than expected, so that theme was dropped. In 1997, Invesco launched its Global Dynamic Themes fund. It picked seven 'dynamic' ones: technology, consumer products and services, telecoms, healthcare, financial services, natural resources and infrastructure. The fund's manager, Andrew Callender, assesses the relative strengths of these themes and identifies the best firms in the most attractive groups. But it was the boom in technology stocks in late 1999 that persuaded other managers to follow the lead of Sarasin and Invesco. The far-reaching impact of the internet has made everyone aware of globalisation, and several managers now see a market for funds with a wider thematic remit. Launches last year included Merrill Lynch's Global Titans fund, Framlington New Leaders and Aberdeen Global Champions. The names imply that they simply focus on big-name multinationals, but the managers' starting point is a theme. Rupert Della-Porter, senior fund manager at Aberdeen, says: 'Our investment strategy has three main pillars: globalisation, communication and innovation. Within each of these are various sub-sectors. In the case of globalisation, there is energy and wealth management, while communication includes telecoms and media.' Framlington's Lesley Hankin concentrates on seven sectors he believes are 'set to dominate growth prospects across the world economy'. They include healthcare, financial services, the internet, technology, the media, telecoms and leisure. 'From these, we will target between 50 and 70 leading companies,' Hankin says. At Merrill Lynch, Neil Beaton is targeting fast-growing companies in 10 major global sectors. 'We believe one or two companies will end up dominating in each industry and these are the companies we want to back,' Beaton says. The fund has focused on energy, fee-based financial services companies, defensive growth stocks such as food and drug retailers, healthcare and certain technology stocks. In contrast, it is underweight in industrial firms, utilities, financials, telecoms, demand-sensitive consumer goods and technology stocks such as PC manufacturers. Most of the stocks in the Merrill Lynch fund are blue chips such as General Electric, Pfizer and Vodafone, though Beaton says the team is looking for tomorrow's 'titans' as well as today's. Beaton says: 'We believe large companies can be as well-run as small ones providing they have the right management.' Another feature that distinguishes global theme funds is that they tend to hold no more than 60 to 80 stocks, compared with the 100 or more that the typical international fund might back at any one time. This concentration can boost returns but it means performance is likely to be more volatile. This is partly why independent financial advisers have mixed views about these funds. Haydn Green of the Nottingham-based Isa Shop believes investors are better off with conventional international funds, which have more freedom of choice. 'A good international fund manager will already be investing in companies that represent these themes as well as having access to boring old-economy stocks,' Greden says. 'I think the funds are a pure gimmick and it is a pity investment groups resort to these methods to get investors to part with their money.' Clive Scott-Hopkins of IFA Towry Law only partly shares this view: 'Managers of successful international funds, such as the Foreign &amp; Colonial and Witan investment trusts, would argue they have been investing in the world's top companies for years. However, theme funds still have a part to play. Many UK investors do not have enough invested overseas and if these modern-sounding funds encourage them to do so, that is a good.' Pascal Matic of IFA Unitas believes the funds are a good idea but advises investors to choose managers carefully. He particularly favours the pioneer, Sarasin EquiSar. But he warns: 'One potential pitfall with this type of fund is there is no disciplined portfolio spread as with an international fund that has a specific benchmark. 'So there is a danger that a manager can get carried away by a particular sector. This makes them a higher-risk investment.' The global-theme funds have suffered from their heavy exposure to technology shares, which is why they have all lost money over the past year. Another risk factor is that they tend to have a relatively large proportion of their portfolios invested in the US, home to many of the world's leading firms, so they will be affected by what happens there. There is little past performance data on which to compare them with conventional international funds. Over the past three years, Sarasin Equisar and Invesco GT Global Dynamic have achieved top-quartile performance in the Global Growth unit trust sector, but mainstream funds such as Fidelity Managed International and Quilter Global Growth did even better. \u0095 This article is from the February issue of 'Money Observer', on sale at newsagents at \u00a33.50.

      "body": "<p>I bought a 'Damien Hirst Donor Card' for 50p at Liverpool Tate. At first sight, it could be mistaken for an organ donor card. On the back, it says: 'I request that after my death my body be preserved in formaldehyde'. </p> <p>No, it's not a Damien Hirst artwork. It is by 37-year-old Liverpool artist Leo Fitzmaurice. A mere scrap, perhaps, but a worthy addition to any collection of artists' 'multiples' - art produced in editions. More than 2,000 of Fitzmaurice's spoof donor cards have been sold, but the Liverpool Tate shop has only one left. Who knows, they might eventually be worth more than 50p. </p> <p>For generations, the traditional way for artists to make affordable multiples has been prints. These days, artists who hit the big time and feel a pang of guilt as their prices soar beyond the reach of their peers in the pub are producing all manner of quirky objects in editions. They are strictly products, rather than copies of an 'original'. </p> <p>Multiples are worth buying, not only for their intrinsic charm and as an inexpensive means of owning a known artist's work, but because - despite the artists' laudable attempt to buck the art market in the name of art-for-all - they will inevitably rise in value if the artists' reputations rise. Some recent examples: empty wooden boxes sold in 1968 for \u00a31.50 each in an edition of 1,200 by Joseph Beuys, the most influential post-war German artist, each inscribed by the artist with the word 'Intuition', have sold at auction for up to \u00a3120,000 each. The American Frank Gehry, acclaimed architect of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, produced armchairs made from laminated cardboard at proletarian prices: one sold for $5,875 at Christie's New York last year. Incensed, he has stopped producing them. </p> <p>Even some of the more ephemeral artists' products are gaining value in collectors' hands. What price the begging dog, fashioned by Tracey Emin from a Marlborough cigarette packet, that she sold me from her 'Tracey Emin Museum', opposite Waterloo station, south London, in 1997, just before she became a household name? It is signed 'Tracey Emin \u00a33'. I cherish it. At the time, she was selling an edition of 200 coy cotton bags, each containing her manuscript 'Exploration of the Soul', for \u00a3350 each, a considerable hike from their starting price of \u00a3100 three years earlier. I could not afford one. </p> <p>Perhaps the most ephemeral multiple of all is Martin Creed's meticulously symmetrical screwed-up ball of A4 paper, \u00a310 in 1995, now \u00a320 and rising. He has so far sold 500 of them. Since he first started making them, when he was broke, he has gained an international reputation for his installation art - such as filling rooms with a sea of balloons. Now, his edition of 100 paper balls, using American paper, is selling at $100 each. He moves to New York on a three-year visa this month. </p> <p>Or, perhaps, the best multiple is the rudimentary collages that the pop artist Peter Blake gave to each of 100 lunch guests at the opening of his 'About Collage' retrospective at Liverpool Tate last year. They are wallet-sized pieces of grey paper rubber-stamped 'Just ABOUT COLLAGE', each collaged with two postage-stamp sized scraps, one plain and coloured, the other cut from a Victorian book. They are also signed, dated and numbered. Which is what matters. Not one was left behind. Who in their right mind would discard a signed Peter Blake, however slight? Likewise, Creed's paper balls - each one has a numbered and signed certificate of authenticity. </p> <p>If you intend embarking on the trail of multiples, you can either pick up scraps of arty memorabilia for free (if you know where to look), or buy from dealers who commission multiples, or spend thousands at auction on highly commercial multiples by big names, batch-produced in the manner of expensive bronzes. The latter category includes the most famous multiple of all, Claes Oldenburg's London Knees - a pair of life-size cast latex knock-knees in a felt-lined suitcase (edition of 120). The most recent example at auction, at Sotheby's, London, 1996, fetched \u00a33,910. </p> <p>To start at the bottom, collect the copious printed ephemera published by agit-prop art groups such as Bank, including an 'obnoxious' newspaper lampooning Charles Saatchi, 'moronic' flyers, and 'childish' edited versions of posh art galleries' press releases. They will no doubt acquire period flavour. A book just published by Bank, a graphic catalogue of its excesses, should also become collectable. </p> <p>Come back the big multiples revival shows, such as the Serpentine Gallery's 'Take Me I'm Yours' of 1995, which handed out free ephemeral multiples. Its free plastic rummage bags for visitors are now collectors' items, as is the full-page colour ad from the German newspaper Der Standard - given away at the show - consisting of a photograph of a nude woman at a typewriter by one Wolfgang Tillmans. What happened to him? He won last year's Turner Prize. </p> <p>Pioneer of the Nineties revival of multiples, originally a Sixties craze, is Sarah Staton, whose travelling Supastore is a parody of the commercialisation of art. Supastore has sold multiples by 300 young artists and travelled as far afield as San Francisco and Tokyo. Staton's 8-inch long Fag-ends , made from painted paper pulp, have been bought by Damien Hirst (whose own signed fag ends, encased in perspex, have sold in an edition of 25 at \u00a3200-\u00a3300 each). Staton's have risen in price from \u00a3200 to \u00a3500. One is in Tate Modern's Century City exhibition. Another multiple by Staton is the biggest seller at Tate Modern's shop: a cotton carrier bag with brown bricks on one side and blue strips on the other (\u00a36.50). You didn't realise they were art? The shop also offers aluminium shelves by sculptor Richard Wentworth (\u00a315) and jewellery by Dinny Hall (\u00a325-\u00a375). </p> <p>The ICA shop in The Mall, London, which launched an annual selling exhibition of multiples, the Glass Shelf Show, in 1994, is a happy hunting ground for collectors. It always has some in stock. Eduardo Paolozzi's signed 15-inch tall plaster models of the Empire State Building are \u00a3200 each. But where are my favourites - his pair of plaster copulating locusts, at around \u00a3170? He donates a couple at a time in aid of ICA funds. </p> <p>The Tate Liverpool shop has some nice lines by three well-known sculptors - Tony Cragg's gardening set, a trowel and potting fork with silver heads (\u00a323.99 each), Richard Deacon's melted metal lump - trivet or doorstop? - (\u00a336.99) and Antony Angel-of-the-North Gormley's minimalistic coat peg (\u00a36.99). You're paying for the name, remember. </p> <p>The Multiple Store at the Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design offers about 20 multiples by both known names and up-and-comers.

      "bodyText": "I bought a 'Damien Hirst Donor Card' for 50p at Liverpool Tate. At first sight, it could be mistaken for an organ donor card. On the back, it says: 'I request that after my death my body be preserved in formaldehyde'. No, it's not a Damien Hirst artwork. It is by 37-year-old Liverpool artist Leo Fitzmaurice. A mere scrap, perhaps, but a worthy addition to any collection of artists' 'multiples' - art produced in editions. More than 2,000 of Fitzmaurice's spoof donor cards have been sold, but the Liverpool Tate shop has only one left. Who knows, they might eventually be worth more than 50p. For generations, the traditional way for artists to make affordable multiples has been prints. These days, artists who hit the big time and feel a pang of guilt as their prices soar beyond the reach of their peers in the pub are producing all manner of quirky objects in editions. They are strictly products, rather than copies of an 'original'. Multiples are worth buying, not only for their intrinsic charm and as an inexpensive means of owning a known artist's work, but because - despite the artists' laudable attempt to buck the art market in the name of art-for-all - they will inevitably rise in value if the artists' reputations rise. Some recent examples: empty wooden boxes sold in 1968 for \u00a31.50 each in an edition of 1,200 by Joseph Beuys, the most influential post-war German artist, each inscribed by the artist with the word 'Intuition', have sold at auction for up to \u00a3120,000 each. The American Frank Gehry, acclaimed architect of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, produced armchairs made from laminated cardboard at proletarian prices: one sold for $5,875 at Christie's New York last year. Incensed, he has stopped producing them. Even some of the more ephemeral artists' products are gaining value in collectors' hands. What price the begging dog, fashioned by Tracey Emin from a Marlborough cigarette packet, that she sold me from her 'Tracey Emin Museum', opposite Waterloo station, south London, in 1997, just before she became a household name? It is signed 'Tracey Emin \u00a33'. I cherish it. At the time, she was selling an edition of 200 coy cotton bags, each containing her manuscript 'Exploration of the Soul', for \u00a3350 each, a considerable hike from their starting price of \u00a3100 three years earlier. I could not afford one. Perhaps the most ephemeral multiple of all is Martin Creed's meticulously symmetrical screwed-up ball of A4 paper, \u00a310 in 1995, now \u00a320 and rising. He has so far sold 500 of them. Since he first started making them, when he was broke, he has gained an international reputation for his installation art - such as filling rooms with a sea of balloons. Now, his edition of 100 paper balls, using American paper, is selling at $100 each. He moves to New York on a three-year visa this month. Or, perhaps, the best multiple is the rudimentary collages that the pop artist Peter Blake gave to each of 100 lunch guests at the opening of his 'About Collage' retrospective at Liverpool Tate last year. They are wallet-sized pieces of grey paper rubber-stamped 'Just ABOUT COLLAGE', each collaged with two postage-stamp sized scraps, one plain and coloured, the other cut from a Victorian book. They are also signed, dated and numbered. Which is what matters. Not one was left behind. Who in their right mind would discard a signed Peter Blake, however slight? Likewise, Creed's paper balls - each one has a numbered and signed certificate of authenticity. If you intend embarking on the trail of multiples, you can either pick up scraps of arty memorabilia for free (if you know where to look), or buy from dealers who commission multiples, or spend thousands at auction on highly commercial multiples by big names, batch-produced in the manner of expensive bronzes. The latter category includes the most famous multiple of all, Claes Oldenburg's London Knees - a pair of life-size cast latex knock-knees in a felt-lined suitcase (edition of 120). The most recent example at auction, at Sotheby's, London, 1996, fetched \u00a33,910. To start at the bottom, collect the copious printed ephemera published by agit-prop art groups such as Bank, including an 'obnoxious' newspaper lampooning Charles Saatchi, 'moronic' flyers, and 'childish' edited versions of posh art galleries' press releases. They will no doubt acquire period flavour. A book just published by Bank, a graphic catalogue of its excesses, should also become collectable. Come back the big multiples revival shows, such as the Serpentine Gallery's 'Take Me I'm Yours' of 1995, which handed out free ephemeral multiples. Its free plastic rummage bags for visitors are now collectors' items, as is the full-page colour ad from the German newspaper Der Standard - given away at the show - consisting of a photograph of a nude woman at a typewriter by one Wolfgang Tillmans. What happened to him? He won last year's Turner Prize. Pioneer of the Nineties revival of multiples, originally a Sixties craze, is Sarah Staton, whose travelling Supastore is a parody of the commercialisation of art. Supastore has sold multiples by 300 young artists and travelled as far afield as San Francisco and Tokyo. Staton's 8-inch long Fag-ends , made from painted paper pulp, have been bought by Damien Hirst (whose own signed fag ends, encased in perspex, have sold in an edition of 25 at \u00a3200-\u00a3300 each). Staton's have risen in price from \u00a3200 to \u00a3500. One is in Tate Modern's Century City exhibition. Another multiple by Staton is the biggest seller at Tate Modern's shop: a cotton carrier bag with brown bricks on one side and blue strips on the other (\u00a36.50). You didn't realise they were art? The shop also offers aluminium shelves by sculptor Richard Wentworth (\u00a315) and jewellery by Dinny Hall (\u00a325-\u00a375). The ICA shop in The Mall, London, which launched an annual selling exhibition of multiples, the Glass Shelf Show, in 1994, is a happy hunting ground for collectors. It always has some in stock. Eduardo Paolozzi's signed 15-inch tall plaster models of the Empire State Building are \u00a3200 each. But where are my favourites - his pair of plaster copulating locusts, at around \u00a3170? He donates a couple at a time in aid of ICA funds. The Tate Liverpool shop has some nice lines by three well-known sculptors - Tony Cragg's gardening set, a trowel and potting fork with silver heads (\u00a323.99 each), Richard Deacon's melted metal lump - trivet or doorstop? - (\u00a336.99) and Antony Angel-of-the-North Gormley's minimalistic coat peg (\u00a36.99). You're paying for the name, remember. The Multiple Store at the Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design offers about 20 multiples by both known names and up-and-comers. Langlands and Bell's scintillating crystal glass cube with embedded laser etching of the world's air routes, in an edition of 100, is \u00a3800 - but the retail price will shortly rise as the edition is dwindling.

Unlike 'nasty' plcs, member-owned societies can concentrate on delivering good-value services to customers, uncon strained by the need to produce dividends. </p> <p>But what does this emphasis on mutuality mean in practice? The boards of two of the larger societies, the Portman and the Chelsea, have both received unwelcome member attention, from two very different directions - what could loosely be described as the greedy grabbers and the dogged democrats. The Chelsea last week rejected a traditional carpet-bagging assault from members attracted by the glint of yet another demutualisation pay-out. The Portman rejected a set of resolutions from a group named Mutual Members, calling for greater democracy and control by members of directors' pay. Ironically, the Mutual Members' initiative is partly the consequence of the society's expulsion of pro-demutualisation members last year. </p> <p>The Nationwide, meanwhile is being pulled in both directions. Although one leading carpetbagger, Northern Ireland plumber Stephen Major, has announced that he would not continue to target the Nationwide, the board is resigned to the prospect of another vote on demutualisation in the summer. Meanwhile, Taunton member and district councillor Alan Debenham hopes to try for a fourth year to get himself elected as a 'members' representative' to the Nationwide board. As he put it last year: 'I am the only candidate who has stood for long hours outside a branch office collecting nominating members' signatures, demonstrating real membership participation and opposition to boardroom self-perpetuation.' </p> <p>The Nationwide has been criticised for a ballot paper that separates Debenham's name from that of other, board-approved candidates. </p> <p>The best way to select non-executive directors - the people who, in theory at least, are chosen by the membership but who many would argue have been traditionally recruited via cosy old boys' networks - has been the focus of debate recently at the Norwich and Peterborough. N&amp;P's directors were joined for the first time at their December meeting by two new non-executive directors, recruited through newspaper adverts. They are Geoff Loades, an accountant who recently retired as Norwich Union's personnel director, and Zara Hammond, a Norwich magistrate with a strong voluntary sec tor background. The advertisements attracted as many as 210 would-be candidates for the directorships, which involve monthly board meetings and carry an annual remuneration of \u00a318,000. According to Matthew Bullock, chief executive, the idea of advertising for candidates - who had to live and work in East Anglia or Lincolnshire - was designed to strengthen the society's links with its core community. 'My board is a strong board, but it tends to have a London feel to it,' he says. </p> <p>Bullock has also instituted regular monthly meetings with members, when he and other senior colleagues travel to a town where the society has branches. Even though, on a good night, only a dozen members turn up, he argues that the meetings are valuable. 'It's important to talk to the society's owners. I think it's a good use of my time,' he says. </p> <p>Nevertheless, and with the proviso that N&amp;P's board has doubled its representation by women, it could be argued that, despite the adverts, the society has ended up with the sort of non-executive directors it would have found through the time-honoured quiet word-in-the-ear way of doing things. Bullock says it is unrealistic to expect someone with no professional experience to operate effectively as a non-executive director: 'We are quite a big business. You've got to know how to handle yourself in the board.' He argues that the direct approach to democracy, as represented by the idea of member-nominated candidates, does not necessarily increase accountability. 'It's a romantic notion. Who do they represent?' </p> <p>However, the hard work of collecting valid nominations and taking on the official board candidates can pay off. The Nationwide is unusual in having two board members who were originally rebel candidates. </p> <p>One, Paul Twyman, was eventually invited to join the Anglia building society board in 1982 before its Nationwide merger after five unsuccessful attempts to win election.

      "body": "<p>The rise, fall and rise again of John Frusciante reads like a rock'n'roll fable. Back in 1991, Frusciante saw his group, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, leap from the LA underground into the mainstream with the classic Blood Sugar Sex Magik. </p> <p>The album produced the group's first breakaway hit, 'Under the Bridge'. The lead guitarist was immediately hailed as the spiritual heir of Bootsy Collins, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck - a virtuoso performer. But Frusciante retired from the group in 1992, after only a year on tour, complaining of exhaustion as the band's hardcore audience multiplied exponentially. </p> <p>Frusciante was eventually rediscovered in 1998, a fragile, decaying figure who had sealed himself into his Hollywood Hills home. His upper teeth had fallen out, his legs, arms and ankles were pocked by cigarette burns and his fingernails were bloodied. Only 28 - and already a lauded guitarist credited with reinventing the art - Frusciante had become a rock'n'roll drug clich\u00e9. </p> <p>'I had made the simple decision to give up living,' he says. He has subsequently undergone restorative dental surgery, and his arms are now scheduled for skin grafts to repair the damage from his addiction. He sits fidgeting with his toes, staring idly at the cup of tea next to him. 'It was as simple as that. I didn't see anything beautiful in the world any more; all the paintings, films and music seemed to be full of death. Can we change the subject?' he asks politely. 'I try not to talk about drugs any more - I just made the conscious decision to stop.' </p> <p>But then his attention wanders back to those bare-bones years. 'I guess I don't mind talking about it - everything seems beautiful now. I listen to music and feel joy. Pure joy. It's not like I'd ever do drugs again - I've made the conscious decision to stop. Just as, back then, I made the conscious decision to become an addict.' </p> <p>The guitarist's rehabilitation was marked by a musical renaissance. He rejoined his former band and their next release, Californication, became their most impressive album since Blood Sugar Sex Magik . His new solo album is another triumph. To Record Only Water For Ten Days, much like Frusciante's previous two solo efforts - Smile From the Streets You Hold in 1997 and the even darker Niandra Lades &amp; Usually Just a T-Shirt from 1995 - show he has a flair for sonics. Tracks like 'Going Inside', 'Remain' and 'Ramparts' display textures previously noted by Brian Wilson on Pet Sounds. And much like Keith Richards's seminal solo record from 1988, Talk Is Cheap, To Record Only Water For Ten Days shows a similar scant regard for pop songwriting conventions. </p> <p>'I'm interested in creating music that doesn't owe anything to the blues,' says Frusciante. 'Guitar players inevitably end up rewriting old blues chords, so guitarists like Robert Johnson and B.B. King are a constant influence. I'm keen to get away from that; at least, I'm trying to get away from it. I think you can do that by treating the guitar as a textural instrument. It's like the way DJs use sound to create a feeling - not the ones who play dance records, but people like Moby and C.J. Bolland who want to create an atmosphere. Y'know? Making music that's like art - layered in many ways.' </p> <p>His full-time employers, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, have now completed a trilogy of albums under the guidance of producer Rick Rubin. </p> <p>'But sometimes I find myself compromised in the studio,' says Frusciante. 'So I look towards my solo material as music that lets me turn music of three-dimensions into four - eventually taking the listener into the fifth dimension.' I look at him blankly and he ventures to elaborate. 'Y'know? Taking people on a journey.' </p> <p>Californians, typified by the East Coast intelligentsia as simple-minded folk from 'the land of the fruits and the nuts', have a knack for producing music oddballs - Brian Wilson, Arthur Lee and Grace Slick. But whereas this trio of music veterans have struggled to reclaim their lost talents, Frusciante, as obviously threadlike as his ego is, seems to have had few problems in flexing his creative muscles. </p> <p>The afternoon wears on and Frusciante seems to shrink deeper into himself. He will stir into life later that evening, during a short set at London venue the Borderline. As he literally and endearingly stumbles through his back catalogue, Frusciante's voice will occasionally trip over the odd line. Not that it really matters - it lends his performance a spontaneity mostly lacking from modern rock musicians. </p> <p>'I don't wanna do that song,' he mumbles. Then, perhaps for the first time in years, Frusciante meets his audience's gaze with a full-mouthed grin. </p> <p>\u0095 To Record Only Water For Ten Days is released on 12 February on WEA.</p>",

'I'm interested in creating music that doesn't owe anything to the blues,' says Frusciante. 'Guitar players inevitably end up rewriting old blues chords, so guitarists like Robert Johnson and B.B. King are a constant influence. I'm keen to get away from that; at least, I'm trying to get away from it. I think you can do that by treating the guitar as a textural instrument. It's like the way DJs use sound to create a feeling - not the ones who play dance records, but people like Moby and C.J. Bolland who want to create an atmosphere. Y'know? Making music that's like art - layered in many ways.' His full-time employers, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, have now completed a trilogy of albums under the guidance of producer Rick Rubin. 'But sometimes I find myself compromised in the studio,' says Frusciante. 'So I look towards my solo material as music that lets me turn music of three-dimensions into four - eventually taking the listener into the fifth dimension.' I look at him blankly and he ventures to elaborate. 'Y'know? Taking people on a journey.' Californians, typified by the East Coast intelligentsia as simple-minded folk from 'the land of the fruits and the nuts', have a knack for producing music oddballs - Brian Wilson, Arthur Lee and Grace Slick. But whereas this trio of music veterans have struggled to reclaim their lost talents, Frusciante, as obviously threadlike as his ego is, seems to have had few problems in flexing his creative muscles. The afternoon wears on and Frusciante seems to shrink deeper into himself. He will stir into life later that evening, during a short set at London venue the Borderline. As he literally and endearingly stumbles through his back catalogue, Frusciante's voice will occasionally trip over the odd line. Not that it really matters - it lends his performance a spontaneity mostly lacking from modern rock musicians. 'I don't wanna do that song,' he mumbles. Then, perhaps for the first time in years, Frusciante meets his audience's gaze with a full-mouthed grin. \u0095 To Record Only Water For Ten Days is released on 12 February on WEA.",

Those who saw her as a totem of alternative culture and leftist-feminist intransigence frowned when she recorded a song for the soundtrack of My Best Friend's Wedding, or chose to work with Prince on To The Teeth, but no one who heard her at Tuesday night's gig could have accused her of selling out. </p> <p>'I'm practising for the presidency,' she shouted over a typical DiFranco improv interlude, where the musicians bleed one song into the next with increasing energy as Ani lets rip with vocal improvisation or political rant: 'There's people back home acting like we had ourselves an election - we didn't!

Aside from making an anti-corporate statement - she's refused endless offers from the major record companies, as the song 'The Million You Never Made' from her album Not A Pretty Girl testifies - this independence allows her to produce albums as quickly as she can write the songs, and Revelling/Reckoning will be her fourteenth in 10 years. </p> <p>The tracks she played from it largely follow on from the horn-heavy feel of To The Teeth, such as the Latin/funk influenced 'What How When Where (Why Who)' or the fierce and melodic 'Marrow', a lament for the end of a relationship, couched in political lan guage: 'I can't believe you let the moral go by while you were soaking in the product placement/And where was your conscience? Where was your consciousness?'. </p> <p>The second disc, Reckoning, has a quieter, more reflective flavour, closer to the folk style of her earlier material, but incorporating the dominant guitar of later albums such as Living In Clip. Through experimental tunings, effects gadgetry and big, pushy bass riffs, Ani produces an extraordinary variety of sounds from her guitar, playing rhythm and lead simultaneously and often making you wonder if there aren't four other guitarists hidden beneath the dry ice. </p> <p>While fans are always hungry to hear her new material, it was the old favourites such as 'Coming Up' and 'Cradle and All' that had them bouncing off the walls. She opened with 'The Diner' and moved into the strident 'Wish I May', whose impossibly catchy hookline - 'Don't tell me/It's gonna be all right/You can't sell me/On your optimism tonight' - proves impossible to flush out of your brain for the next week. </p> <p>On stage, she could still pass for 19, though her ever-changing hair is now tied back in dreadlocks; the grin, the slightly goofy humour, the passion and the fierce eyes all give her a powerful stage presence, although from the back of the auditorium you could barely see her diminutive figure above the crowd. </p> <p>She may have moved away from her roots but her music is increasingly adventurous, and her lyrics are still a raucous call to arms for those who want to change the world.</p>",

She started more than 40 years ago and, with the exception of a gap when her children were young, she has nursed ever since. She has now retired but still nurses part-time at a local GP's surgery and does occasional shifts at the hospital where she used to be employed. </p> <p>When she officially retired, as a sister in the minor injuries and outpatients unit, in September 1999, the NHS provided her with access to an independent financial adviser for advice on investing her retirement lump sum. She placed \u00a310,000 in a Clerical Medical With Profits Bond, \u00a39,000 in a Sun Life Flexible Bond and \u00a33,000 in a NPI Global Care Isa. She is not taking any income from these investments but may need to when she stops working part-time, probably when she reaches 65. </p> <p>Eleanor doesn't expect her husband, Peter, a self-employed graphic designer, to receive much of a pension. The only other investments they have are \u00a33,000 in a joint account at Bristol &amp; West, and a cash Isa in her husband's name. </p> <p>Her main concern is for her three children, aged 28 to 35. 'None is earning sufficient to provide any future security', she says. She would like to be sure that they will inherit the family home, worth about \u00a3180,000. </p> <p>Eleanor is not sure whether it would be best to take out long-term care insurance, or if there is any other way she and Peter can safeguard their property from being used to pay for any long-term care they may need. She believes they would be able to afford the premiums until they reach 65 at least, and says their children would help with premiums thereafter. </p> <p>Other possibilities are to hand the house to their children now, or to draw up a five-way trust to reduce the likelihood of the house being used to fund any care.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Sharon Linnard</strong></p> <p>Eleanor will need to think carefully before taking out insurance against the possibility of requiring long- term care. If it is to be funded on a monthly premium basis, a benefit of \u00a310,000 a year - even allowing a waiting period of 13 weeks before it becomes payable - is likely to cost \u00a350-\u00a360 a month each for her and her husband. </p> <p>It seems unlikely that this can comfortably be met out of income. Regular withdrawals could be made from the Clerical Medical and Sun Life bonds to meet the cost, but this would stunt, if not extinguish, all growth from investments which were intended to supplement retirement income.</p> <p>Under the current rules, provided only one spouse requires long-term care and the other remains living in the house, its value is not taken into account. If the need for long-term care arises after the first death, the house has to be disposed of, or the cost is treated as a debt which has to be extinguished when the property is finally sold. However, it is proposed that, from October this year the state will pick up the cost of nursing care.</p> <p>It is worth exploring the possibility of putting the house in trust now as, if this action is deferred until long-term care is needed, it is almost certain that it would be seen as a deliberate attempt to avoid an imminent cost.</p> <p>However, a better way of helping the children may be to contribute to pension policies in their own names under the new stakeholder-type contracts, which will become available from April. </p> <p>Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant KPMG.</p> <p> <strong>Adviser 2: Gordon Wilson </strong></p> <p>Eleanor's concern is one shared by an increasing number of people as they approach retirement. There is no easy solution. She could take out an insurance policy, but policies of this type are quite expensive. I think it is a good idea for the children to contribute towards the cost, as it is they who stand to benefit. But they could be paying for something that may never be needed. </p> <p>If Eleanor uses a trust in the hope of avoiding the house being included in any means assessment, I would expect a local authority to challenge this. Similar cases have gone to court and local authorities have enjoyed a great deal of success.</p> <p>Gifting of assets of any type, including savings and investments, to avoid paying care costs is a high-risk strategy. A common misconception is that there is some kind of time limit, so that provided the gift is made, say, two, three or seven years prior to care being needed, it will be successful.</p> <p>This is not the case. Local authorities can look into your financial history as far back as they choose and again could argue that you had deliberately deprived yourself of assets - in which case you will be asked to pay the care costs regardless.</p> <p>Fortunately, the Government's position would appear to be softening slightly on the long-term care issue. It is expected that it will start to pay for nursing care from October this year, although the details are sketchy and it is not clear what this will amount to. </p> <p>Gordon Wilson works for financial adviser Thomson &amp; Shepherd Investors. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

When she officially retired, as a sister in the minor injuries and outpatients unit, in September 1999, the NHS provided her with access to an independent financial adviser for advice on investing her retirement lump sum. She placed \u00a310,000 in a Clerical Medical With Profits Bond, \u00a39,000 in a Sun Life Flexible Bond and \u00a33,000 in a NPI Global Care Isa. She is not taking any income from these investments but may need to when she stops working part-time, probably when she reaches 65. Eleanor doesn't expect her husband, Peter, a self-employed graphic designer, to receive much of a pension. The only other investments they have are \u00a33,000 in a joint account at Bristol &amp; West, and a cash Isa in her husband's name. Her main concern is for her three children, aged 28 to 35. 'None is earning sufficient to provide any future security', she says. She would like to be sure that they will inherit the family home, worth about \u00a3180,000. Eleanor is not sure whether it would be best to take out long-term care insurance, or if there is any other way she and Peter can safeguard their property from being used to pay for any long-term care they may need. She believes they would be able to afford the premiums until they reach 65 at least, and says their children would help with premiums thereafter. Other possibilities are to hand the house to their children now, or to draw up a five-way trust to reduce the likelihood of the house being used to fund any care. Adviser 1: Sharon Linnard Eleanor will need to think carefully before taking out insurance against the possibility of requiring long- term care. If it is to be funded on a monthly premium basis, a benefit of \u00a310,000 a year - even allowing a waiting period of 13 weeks before it becomes payable - is likely to cost \u00a350-\u00a360 a month each for her and her husband. It seems unlikely that this can comfortably be met out of income. Regular withdrawals could be made from the Clerical Medical and Sun Life bonds to meet the cost, but this would stunt, if not extinguish, all growth from investments which were intended to supplement retirement income. Under the current rules, provided only one spouse requires long-term care and the other remains living in the house, its value is not taken into account. If the need for long-term care arises after the first death, the house has to be disposed of, or the cost is treated as a debt which has to be extinguished when the property is finally sold. However, it is proposed that, from October this year the state will pick up the cost of nursing care. It is worth exploring the possibility of putting the house in trust now as, if this action is deferred until long-term care is needed, it is almost certain that it would be seen as a deliberate attempt to avoid an imminent cost. However, a better way of helping the children may be to contribute to pension policies in their own names under the new stakeholder-type contracts, which will become available from April. Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant KPMG. Adviser 2: Gordon Wilson Eleanor's concern is one shared by an increasing number of people as they approach retirement. There is no easy solution. She could take out an insurance policy, but policies of this type are quite expensive. I think it is a good idea for the children to contribute towards the cost, as it is they who stand to benefit. But they could be paying for something that may never be needed. If Eleanor uses a trust in the hope of avoiding the house being included in any means assessment, I would expect a local authority to challenge this. Similar cases have gone to court and local authorities have enjoyed a great deal of success. Gifting of assets of any type, including savings and investments, to avoid paying care costs is a high-risk strategy. A common misconception is that there is some kind of time limit, so that provided the gift is made, say, two, three or seven years prior to care being needed, it will be successful. This is not the case. Local authorities can look into your financial history as far back as they choose and again could argue that you had deliberately deprived yourself of assets - in which case you will be asked to pay the care costs regardless. Fortunately, the Government's position would appear to be softening slightly on the long-term care issue. It is expected that it will start to pay for nursing care from October this year, although the details are sketchy and it is not clear what this will amount to.

      "body": "<p>If you thought that a less-than-perfect memory was a good excuse for writing down the personal identification number that gives you access to your bank account, think again. </p> <p>The new Banking Code, which came into effect on 1 January, is unambiguous. 'Never write down or record your Pin and other security information,' it says. This is a departure from the previous code, which advised 'never write down or record your Pin on the card or on anything kept with or near it' - or only if you disguise it. </p> <p>But with the growing automation of retail financial services leading to a proliferation of Pins, passwords, and security information, many see this as flying in the face of common sense and reality. John Barker from Basingstoke, Hampshire, has online accounts with the Nationwide and Barclays. He also trades online with Sharetrade. Although he uses the same passcode for two of his accounts, Barker says that remembering everything is still hard. </p> <p>'I have so many numbers, I have to write them down. Nobody could remember them all,' he says. </p> <p>His solution is to pin up a grid of 50 numbers on his home computer, a practice in effect banned by the code, even though he says it is safe. 'Nobody but me knows what they mean, not even my wife.' </p> <p>Inexplicably forgetting information vital to carrying out everyday financial tasks is not limited to those with online accounts. Amnesia often strikes without warning on the phone - or at the ATM, when customers are left not only cashless but also cardless as their plastic is swallowed up. </p> <p>Nicholas Bohm, a solicitor and co-author of Electronic Commerce: Who Carries the Risk of Fraud? , argues that the new advice is impractical and detrimental to customers. 'It either forces them to use easy-to- remember and therefore insecure information, or secure but more obscure information which they can't recall without writing down,' he says. </p> <p>Telephone banking can be particularly non-user-friendly, he says. 'With upper and lower case characters, numbers, dashes, and up to 40 characters long, who the heck can really remember all this without writing it down?' </p> <p>Mark Swyny, a senior manager in Banking Code compliance at LloydsTSB, reiterates the code's advice. He says that as Pins are chosen by customers, and security information is self-selected and known by customers, writing the data down 'shouldn't be necessary'.

      "bodyText": "If you thought that a less-than-perfect memory was a good excuse for writing down the personal identification number that gives you access to your bank account, think again. The new Banking Code, which came into effect on 1 January, is unambiguous. 'Never write down or record your Pin and other security information,' it says. This is a departure from the previous code, which advised 'never write down or record your Pin on the card or on anything kept with or near it' - or only if you disguise it. But with the growing automation of retail financial services leading to a proliferation of Pins, passwords, and security information, many see this as flying in the face of common sense and reality. John Barker from Basingstoke, Hampshire, has online accounts with the Nationwide and Barclays. He also trades online with Sharetrade. Although he uses the same passcode for two of his accounts, Barker says that remembering everything is still hard. 'I have so many numbers, I have to write them down. Nobody could remember them all,' he says. His solution is to pin up a grid of 50 numbers on his home computer, a practice in effect banned by the code, even though he says it is safe. 'Nobody but me knows what they mean, not even my wife.' Inexplicably forgetting information vital to carrying out everyday financial tasks is not limited to those with online accounts. Amnesia often strikes without warning on the phone - or at the ATM, when customers are left not only cashless but also cardless as their plastic is swallowed up. Nicholas Bohm, a solicitor and co-author of Electronic Commerce: Who Carries the Risk of Fraud? , argues that the new advice is impractical and detrimental to customers. 'It either forces them to use easy-to- remember and therefore insecure information, or secure but more obscure information which they can't recall without writing down,' he says. Telephone banking can be particularly non-user-friendly, he says. 'With upper and lower case characters, numbers, dashes, and up to 40 characters long, who the heck can really remember all this without writing it down?' Mark Swyny, a senior manager in Banking Code compliance at LloydsTSB, reiterates the code's advice. He says that as Pins are chosen by customers, and security information is self-selected and known by customers, writing the data down 'shouldn't be necessary'. He argues that the new code helps customers by stipulating that they should be able to change their Pins at any stage, allowing them to choose something memorable. However, he admits that LloydsTSB customers who were previously with Lloyds will not have this option until March. Brian Morris from the British Banker's Association, who helped draft the code, says that while it is binding on banks and building societies, it can serve only as advice and best practice for consumers. 'It should be practical advice for most people, but banks can't insist on these things.' One group that will find this guidance more impractical than most is Britain's growing 'grey' population. Recent research presented to the British Psychological Society indicated that the ability to memorise telephone numbers or people's names goes into decline from the age of 40. Not withstanding the practical difficulties involved in complying with the code, anyone flouting it could be out of pocket. Whereas the previous code warned that acts of 'gross negligence' may make customers liable for losses, the new version uses the phrase 'without reasonable care'. For customers, and especially those in dispute with their bank or building society, what this means in practice will depend on the Banking Ombudsman. Swyny is adamant that there will be no change.

That's one of the best things about night sleepers. They prolong your active life. Instead of wasting your evening travelling and arriving in the dread early hours, you can waste it having fun and arrive at an acceptably early hour. My parents, for example, took the Night Riviera to Cornwall, on the evening of their wedding, to honeymoon in St Ives. The grown-up princess and I took it, too, though many years after we were wed.</p> <p>It was waiting for us, quietly, on platform one at Paddington. The walk from taxi to sleeping compartment is little further than the one from sitting room to bedroom. If we'd been so minded, we could have been bunked up by 10.30, giving nearly 10 hours of sleeping - or whatevering - before arriving at Penzance. We were shown to our compartment by Nick the steward, a grey-haired man with a comfortable belly and a belt full of keys. He jangled as he walked, like an affable prison warder showing us to our cell for the night. The compartments are certainly as cell-like as sleeping coaches have always been - ideal quarters for a very small, very penitent monk. While we edged in, Nick stood outside, pointing to the switches, the sink, the coat hangers. This being 2001, he also pointed to the safety instructions and the window hammer.</p> <p>Matt the photographer snapped away, fascinated by the details. 'Plaid blanket,' he said. 'Blue walls,' I replied. 'Free bottle of Becontree, \"the prince of mineral waters\",' he said. 'Used to be Malvern Water in British Rail days,' I reminisced. Matt kept snapping.</p> <p>'The photographer's not coming with us, you know,' my wife told Nick the steward. 'There's not going to be three of us in here.' Nick didn't flicker, just gave a West Country grin. 'I've seen everything on this job,' he said. 'Everything.'</p> <p>That's the other great thing about sleepers: the romance of them. Not just the fact that they are steel-and-moquette proof of the laws of quantum mechanics, taking you from one place to another seemingly without passing through the space in between. Not just the reflected romance of the litany of American cities that James Brown calls out on 'Night Train' or the mood of Gladys Knight and the Pips' 'Midnight Train to Georgia' - which was the midnight plane till the writer, Jim Weatherly, was advised that 'train' sounded more romantic.</p> <p>There's also that, you know, other stuff. Boys play with their trains. Grown-ups play trains and tunnels. Even the sexually ornate and residually Catholic Alfred Hitchcock knew that. See North by Northwest . The film ends with a beginning - the hero and heroine's FF, in a sleeping compartment. Cary Grant climbs into Eva Marie Saint's bunk. Camera cuts to shot of train entering tunnel. Point made, with Hitchcockily dirty joke. Credits roll.</p> <p>For a time, I used sleepers a lot, returning overnight to London after a late working day. British Rail ran few evening long-distance services. The last train from Manchester was at 6.30pm, so it was the sleeper or nothing - despite the fact that the regular service took little more than two hours.</p> <p>Still, there were was often something magical about them. Standing quite alone on Troon platform on a chill summer's midnight, waiting for the boat train from Stranraer, not quite believing it would arrive, let alone stop, then seeing it swoosh out of the mist and the steward open the door right in front of where I'd been told to stand. Catching it back from Newcastle with the Clash - a spit of punks in bondage trousers confused by the train heading north out of Central Station, making its journey back to London the long way round via Scotland. I don't think I've seen a sorrier sight than us at King's Cross far too early the following morning. Returning from Liverpool with a loudmouthed friend in the Thatcher years and being told to quieten down by the steward. 'The prime minister's in the next compartment,' he explained. As Thatcher famously never travelled by train, we ignored him. At 4am, an accident further on meant we were turfed out at Watford Junction. There, right by the Metropolitan line platform with his Special Branch minders, was Harold Wilson.</p> <p>The grown-up princess was visibly disappointed by the compartment. It had been many years since she'd travelled on a British sleeper. She'd imagined - understandably - that they'd progressed somewhat since then. She'd had dreams of a double bed, delicate lighting, an en suite toilet, maybe even a shower. 'Mad, I know,' she said. 'But those were my dreams.'</p> <p>The reality is prosaic. It's hard to imagine a child being named Sleeper, after the location of their conception. The design is very 70s, though also very well thought out. Everything is there, close to hand. It works. It just isn't, you know, romantic. Rather than go to bunk straightaway, we sat up like grown-ups, in the all-night buffet bar, being served by a short, amiable Scotsman with a vast hearts and scrolls tattoo on his right forearm. 'Go on,' he said. 'Have another chunky KitKat. You know you'll only want it in a minute.'</p> <p>A trickle of other passengers joined us. We were engaged in a conversation about the train photography of O Winston Link. We watched the train crew being charming and helpful to people who possibly didn't deserve it. We talked about how trains should offer compartments during the day - part htel de passe , part albergo di giorno , the resting places at Italian railway stations. We decided that proper showers should be offered at all major stations on the route, not just at Paddington.</p> <p>We drank tea. We smelled other people drinking whisky. We bunked off. The train entered the tunnel. Many hours later, Nick woke us up with tea. We emerged, blinking, into the stunning light of Mount's Bay. We'll do it again.</p> <p>\u0095 The Night Riviera leaves for Penzance every night except Saturday from Paddington Station, London, at 23.50. It returns from Penzance at 22.00.

She'd had dreams of a double bed, delicate lighting, an en suite toilet, maybe even a shower. 'Mad, I know,' she said. 'But those were my dreams.' The reality is prosaic. It's hard to imagine a child being named Sleeper, after the location of their conception. The design is very 70s, though also very well thought out. Everything is there, close to hand. It works. It just isn't, you know, romantic. Rather than go to bunk straightaway, we sat up like grown-ups, in the all-night buffet bar, being served by a short, amiable Scotsman with a vast hearts and scrolls tattoo on his right forearm. 'Go on,' he said. 'Have another chunky KitKat. You know you'll only want it in a minute.' A trickle of other passengers joined us. We were engaged in a conversation about the train photography of O Winston Link. We watched the train crew being charming and helpful to people who possibly didn't deserve it. We talked about how trains should offer compartments during the day - part htel de passe , part albergo di giorno , the resting places at Italian railway stations. We decided that proper showers should be offered at all major stations on the route, not just at Paddington. We drank tea. We smelled other people drinking whisky. We bunked off. The train entered the tunnel. Many hours later, Nick woke us up with tea. We emerged, blinking, into the stunning light of Mount's Bay. We'll do it again. \u0095 The Night Riviera leaves for Penzance every night except Saturday from Paddington Station, London, at 23.50. It returns from Penzance at 22.00. Fares start at \u00a3139 for two sharing one berth. For details, call 08457 000 125.",

Night is a glorious time that is normally, in these frantic, devil-may-care days, associated with naughtiness and pandemonium, when good folks should be asleep.</p> <p>Indeed, the night has become an institution complete with nightclubs and ladies (as well as, of course, laddies) of the night, which is interesting, because cherishing the night as a concept at all is really a rather childlike idea.</p> <p>There is, in fact, no night. Not in any a-priori sense, anyway. What's happening to create this illusion, as you know, is the earth spinning on its axis at a 1,000mph in an easterly direction in relation to the sun, around which it orbits at 66,000mph every hour of the year. And when the part upon which you situate yourself in the morning has rotated sufficiently, you will find yourself, within approximately eight to 14 hours, depending on current orbital position and respective axial tilt, on the other side of the planet from any available sunlight, other than that possibly reflected by the moon and, to a lesser extent, other planets or various human-made satellites.</p> <p>But although the night as fact is an illusion (caused by lack of sunlight), the darkness is not. According to the wisdom of the oriental Taoists, darkness equates to the a-priori quality of yin, which represents the passive or static force of nature and light to that of yang, the active or dynamic force. During the sunlight hours, your body soaks up yang energy from the sun, like a solar cell, which it utilises to see you through your waking hours. During the hours of darkness, your body soaks up yin energy from the ground to help it rest.</p> <p>They, those Taoists of old, were, of course, observing human patterns from the unpolluted vantage point of high mountain caves with no mobile-phone coverage. But electricity and the 24/7 lifestyles it facilitates have confused this natural cycle somewhat and have us now, on the whole, expending inordinate amounts of (yang) energy, going out on the razzle and what have you when we would, if following natural laws, be resting.</p> <p>But following natural laws to the letter, in such a sweetshop as our postmodern, multiple-choice life, makes Jack a dull boy (and, of course, Jacqueline a dull girl). And so together we say 'Bully!' to good old yin and yang and we drink and make merry into the wee, small hours. (And then complain we don't have enough energy, feel stressed and tired the next day.)</p> <p>But when after such revelry, or simply after letting yourself be drugged half to death by the gamma rays from your TV set, it finally comes time to touch head to pillow, what can be done to effect the most restorative sleep possible and thus optimise on what the power of nature's yin force has to offer?</p> <p>Firstly, to induce sleep initially, having applied a drop or two of lavender essential oil to the temples to calm the mind, it is helpful to press the acupressure point known as your 'spirit door' which lies on and has the effect of sedating your heart-energy meridian. According to Oriental medicine, your heart is responsible for your mind and its ability to alter modes, in this case to turn itself off for a few hours, preferably eight.</p> <p>Locate this point by looking at either palm, running an imaginary line down the middle of your little finger, and over the palm to the wrist bracelet-marking at its base. Press this point bilaterally for a minute or so with pressure firm enough to cause a slight ache. This will help effectively turn your conscious mind off like a mild sedative within 10 minutes or so.</p> <p>In the interim, take this brief opportunity while your mind is at its most susceptible to suggest to yourself both how you'd like to sleep and how (as well as when) you'd like to wake up. For example: 'I will sleep deeply with enjoyable and informative dreams and wake up at seven feeling refreshed, energised, optimistic and ready for the day ahead!'</p> <p>To help you remain asleep for the duration, it is best to sleep on your right side, both to prevent an overload of venous blood to the heart, which would provoke unpleasant and erratic dreams, and to encourage more blood to circulate through your liver, where it undergoes purification while you sleep.</p> <p>One of the biggest hindrances to remaining asleep through the night, especially when you are under stress, is the eruption of sudden noise, of say a passing car with throbbing bass bins at four in the morning. These things happen (and mustn't be taken personally, as becoming aggravated when woken makes it much harder to fall asleep again). For this reason, you may wish to avail yourself of earplugs, as a basic precaution.</p> <p>As for ingesting sleep-enhancing substances, while the allopathic sleeping pills or muscle relaxants favoured by many may be an effective expedient in the short term, they obviously do untold damage if taken habitually. A short course of craniosacral therapy is an efficient way to reset your internal clock naturally when disturbed or if you wish to break a sleeping-pill addiction. Bear in mind also that using herbal sleep aids should not be mistakenly considered harmless just because they are 'only herbal'. Habitual use of herbal sedatives can damage your liver and kidneys as much as their chemical cousins.</p> <p>And so to the almost unmentionable: sex, or more precisely orgasm, as sedative. If you're in a happy relationship, love-making and cuddles often provide all the sedative action you need. If you're alone and know how, you can always meditate, or, excuse me for stating the obvious, even masturbate, which is, as you'd expect, by all accounts one of the most popular drowsiness inducers on the market.</p> <p>If choosing the former (meditative path), you may find it enjoyable to imagine you are gazing at your boudoir through the middle of your forehead, the so-called third eye, as you drift off, because this encourages conscious dreaming. However, if choosing the latter (hedonistic path)... well, I'm sure you don't need any advice from this barefoot doctor. (Nighty night!)</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, I've been suffering from gum disease for a few months on and off. I am good with dental hygiene and my dentist thinks the condition may caused by stress. Is there anything I can do?<br><b> Sheila Dale, King's Langley</b></p> <p>It's possible you have excess stomach heat as well as deficient kidney yin energy. Consider having a short course of acupuncture to redress the imbalance, as well as approaching it homeopathically. Additionally, there is an old Taoist technique for increasing circulation to the gums and thus helping clear infections, which involves circling the tip of your tongue around first the inside and then outside of your gums up to 18 times in each direction. (This will also give you a very strong tongue!) Also, you might try squeezing a lemon into a glass of water and gargling with it, whooshing it round your gums.</p> <p>Dear BD: I wouldn't say I get panic attacks exactly, but I do tend to panic at the smallest things, like having my money ready for the bus.

Rob H, via email While it's possible that St John's Wort might help you feel more positive and confident in the moment, I think we, as a culture, rely too heavily on taking things to make us better. Panic is a habit we often pick up unconsciously from an anxious parent or older sibling, and as such can be changed over time. Breathing fluidly - evenly slowly and deeply - in and out to the count of, say, nine each way, and focusing the mind on that rather than the details that cause you to panic will steady your mind and enable you to override the panic and act more effectively.

      "body": "<p>As day becomes night, darkness triggers the changes in the body that prepare us for sleep - relaxing hormones take over from stress ones, your temperature drops and your whole system slows down. But be warned - once you're asleep, changes carry on occurring that make your body behave differently and it's best to know what you're dealing with.</p> <p><b> Your skin:</b> Night time is prime regenerative time for your skin - particularly between the hours of 2am and 3am. Studies by cosmetic companies have shown that this is when the skin is abuzz with surges of growth hormone and other substances that lead to the formation of collagen and the repair of some of the DNA damage that occurs every day through exposure to UV rays. The skin is also more porous at this time, which means that any skincare on the face or body is likely to be more effective at getting to the lower levels of skin where it's actually needed. Dermatologist Nicholas Lowe, from London's Cranley Clinic, has speculated that this increased permeability may be due to the amount we sweat while we sleep. On average, we lose about half a litre of fluid from our body each night. This dehydrates the skin, and when skin is dry it will try and draw moisture from the air, sucking in anything else it finds on the way. And you'd better hope it does find something or you're increasing your chance of wrinkles. On average, we change position every 12 minutes while we sleep, and that movement causes the skin on the face to crease. 'If the skin is dehydrated, that creasing won't bounce back and you'll actually create a permanent line in the skin,' says New Orleans-based dermatologist Professor Mary Lupo. 'This is why people who sleep on their front are always more wrinkled than those who sleep on their back.' Lupo therefore advises sleeping face up, if you can, or at least using a satin pillowcase which allows you to slip and slide across the surface and cut crease potential. Of course, it's still important to keep the skin hydrated, so moisturise well before bed with a product you know you're not allergic to - your immune system is more active at night, making allergic reactions more likely.</p> <p><b> Your lungs:</b> Breathing slows at night and the muscles of the chest relax. Still, if you're asthmatic, you are more than 100 times more likely to have an attack at 4am than any other point in the day. The main culprit is the lowered levels of adrenaline while we sleep. 'Adrenaline is the fight or flight hormone,' says Dr Jim Waterhouse, from the Institute of Sport and Exercise at Liverpool John Moores University. 'It prepares us to move fast during times of stress and attack and it's present in our body the whole time we are awake. One of its jobs is to keep the airways of the respiratory system wide open so, should we need to run, we are able to breathe faster.' To help us sleep, however, adrenaline levels have to fall and as this happens the airways constrict, becoming their smallest at around 4am, which in an asthma sufferer can be enough to bring on an attack - especially as the airways are likely to be irritated anyway. Night time brings us into contact with one of the most common triggers for asthma: the house dust mite. Ten per cent of us are allergic to their droppings, and the average bed can contain 2m mites producing around 20 droppings each an hour. And the mites (and the droppings) don't just stay in the bed. 'While you sleep you probably have around 1,000 mites running around your eyelids,' says Waterhouse. The good news is dust mites can die. Switching to foam pillows and spraying with anti-mite sprays like Secto, \u00a35.95 from Boots, can help (Boots also sells anti-allergy bedding). Also invest in a dehumidifier (from major electrical stores). Mites can't survive in humidity of less than 50 per cent. If you do try everything and are still having trouble, ask your doctor about time-release inhalers (Uniphyllin Continus is the most commonly used here). These ensure that the active ingredient (something called theophylline, which keeps the airways open) actually reaches its peak around 4am.</p> <p><b> Your metabolism:</b> The metabolism is the speed at which we burn calories, and it slows down at night. Obviously this is partly because you're not moving around, but there is more to it than that. 'Sleep slows the speed at which you carry out bodily processes that burn energy [like breathing],' says Professor Horne. 'The result of this is that you expend about 10 per cent fewer calories when you're lying asleep than you would lying in exactly the same position when you're awake.' Weight watchers might like to know that this nightly calorie deficit can be offset by weight training. The more muscle you have in the body, the more calories you burn even if you're sitting still - one study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that regular weight training boosts your basal metabolic rate (the calories you burn sitting still) by 15 per cent - 5 per cent more than that night-time drop. For best results, work out three to five times a week on all your major muscle groups, choosing a weight on which you can do no more than three sets of eight to 12 repetitions.</p> <p><b> Your circulation:</b> According to major US research, you have a 70 per cent greater chance of having a heart attack or stroke between 7am and 9am than at any other point in the day. The reason for this is the circulatory changes that occur in your body at night. 'The main one of these is that blood pressure drops, because we're lying down and the heart has to work less hard to pump blood around the body,' says Professor Horne. Now while low blood pressure is generally a good thing, it does also mean that if you wake up and suddenly jump out of bed, the heart and circulatory system have to work harder to get things moving. 'And if there is a weakness in the heart, this can sometimes be too much of a shock for it.' Do your heart a favour, and sit up and relax for 10 minutes to allow your body to get used to sending blood upwards for a while.</p> <p><b> Your back:</b> When you wake up in the morning, you're about an inch taller than when you went to bed the night before. This has nothing however to do with the spurts of growth hormone regulating your appetite and everything to do with the discs in your back. 'The weight of the trunk and head pressing down on the discs of the spine compresses them by around 10 per cent throughout the day,' says ergonomist Jim Taylour from seating manufacturer Giroflex. 'However, a night's rest allows the discs to re-absorb fluids and nutrients and causes them to swell.' The result is that the discs are fatter in the morning than they were the night before, which stretches the spine those extra few centimetres. Unfortunately the fatter discs are more prone to injury and squishing out of place than compressed ones - making the action of bending forward to put your socks on a perilous activity. Waiting 30 minutes before doing any bending (or vigorous) activity will help prevent injury potential, because by then standing up will have depressed the discs again (and you'll be back to normal height).</p> <p><b> Your joints:</b> Arthritis sufferers find that joint pain is definitely worse at night - exactly when depends on what type they have. Osteoarthritis sufferers usually find things are worse when they first get into bed, as the inflammation that causes the problem is aggravated by an accumulation of daily activity. According to experts on chronotherapy (the science of taking drugs to fit in with the body clock) at the Food and Drug Administration in Washington DC, if you want to be rid of this, you should take your inflammation-fighting drugs around mid-afternoon, so they're at peak strength when inflammation is likely to be at its worse. On the other hand, the pain of rheumatoid arthritis is likely to be worse in the early hours. 'A hormone called cortisol is the culprit here,' says Dr Waterhouse. 'Cortisol suppresses the immune system. However, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the immune system is overactive, so the presence of cortisol reduces its severity and it gets worse about eight hours after cortisol disappears - which happens as we start to sleep.' The chronotherapists therefore recommend that rheumatoid arthritis sufferers take their pills at night. This cortisol response is also the reason why allergic reactions are more likely at night - they too are caused by an overactive immune system.</p> <p><b> Your sex life:</b> While the peak time for couples in the UK to make love is 10.34pm, the time our bodies are most in the mood is around 6am. Levels of testosterone in men and progesterone and oestrogen in women are five times higher then than at any other point in the day, and physically we are primed for action. 'Around 6am is prime time for dream sleep, and when we dream, blood floods the sex organs,' says Dr Harvey Moldofsky from the Center of Sleep and Chronobiology in Toronto. 'In women, the vagina and clitoris get engorged, and men get an erection. All the signs point that we're ready to make love now.' Sadly, however, most of us sleep through these urges, or if we are up and about at 6am it's normally because the office is calling. Which, according to Dr Moldofsky, is increasingly the problem with many of our body-clock urges. 'They don't always fit in with society. We're designed to sleep after lunch, yet we can't do it; we confine love-making to the end of the day when we may not be physically in the mood. However, we should accept that our bodies programme these rhythms for a reason, and perhaps start listening to them.' *</p>",

They are scared of them, that they will lose their boys and girls to an intimate, changeling night. So they tuck them up and tuck them in, hoping that their little ones aren't corrupted by the bad dreams, the bad thoughts. Yet there's nothing innocent about slumber. My earliest memories of dreams were always strange and dark, full of monsters and fearful knowledge. Things that the grown-ups would never tell you of. The night is an unruly time when the imagination runs riot against the authority of the day. </p> <p>I often work at night. It's a fertile time for a writer. And you're less likely to get disturbed. Saturday night's the best. I look down on the busy streets where I live, watching the revellers below, and kid myself I am having a better time than them. I am making my own entertainment, I say to myself, if they only knew what a good time I'm having. Writing is, in a sense, an anti-life activity, and you've got to keep yourself going somehow and not dwell too much on the thought that you are scribbling your years away. And sometimes, in the wee small hours, you can be hacking away and hit pay dirt. You can tap into that child's imagination that you had all those years ago. Though at other times you can feel so inspired (maybe having had one too many of those funny cigarettes) and you can produce reams of stuff that in the cold light of day reveal themselves as insomniac nonsense. Whatever, I always keep pen and paper on a clipboard by my bed. You never know when you might come up with something. Sleeping on an idea, you can wake up to catch the odd sentence or snatch of dialogue. </p> <p>I avoid writing down dreams, though. We don't really remember them, not consciously. We can't. We no longer have the infant logic to unravel them. Their very strangeness eludes our understanding. We rationalise, we edit, we try to reassemble. We work our way through the maze, but we're left with a ball of yarn rather than a map of the labyrinth. And they play tricks with us as we come to the surface. This is the very puzzle of the night, the interface between sleep and waking. </p> <p>By the time we are teenagers, the night means mischief. Telling lies to our parents, getting hold of cheap cider or whatever can furnish a derangement of the senses. Teenage Neverland. Breaking into premises, wreaking havoc with senseless acts of vandalism and then sneaking back to our beds. I remember one night when I had been stopped by the police, up to no good (but not up to that much bad either), and they had taken my name and address and sent me home. I crept into bed sheepishly, my head still throbbing with Strongbow, and my dad came into my room. As I feigned sleep, I expected a telling off but instead he found it all quite amusing and told me he'd been just like me at that age. The worst horror of all - he understood. You can imagine what surly resentment that engendered. </p> <p>Leaving home, we can not only stay out late, we can stay out all night. In my day, the big thing was speed. A jaw-clenching drug to trick the night of sleep. We had to experience it all, play it all out in clubs and all-nighters, torturing ourselves with sleep deprivation. The bright lights of the city burning into the darkness, extra sharp. A delirious sense of power of having not dreamt, of being constantly alert, alive. Of course, it had its horrible pitfalls. Comedown. Amphetamine psychosis where your dreams catch up with you. I remember after a particularly long binge finding myself in a cinema matin\u00e9e surrounded by hallucinations just out of view, turning around in my seat every so often to try and catch the shadow of something just behind my shoulder. There was an awful sense of mortality that stalked a youthful desire to have fun, to live into the night. By being awake at night and sleeping by day, we imagined we were turning time around. And if time is upside down, maybe it will go backwards as well and we'll stay forever young. </p> <p>And that sense of mortality is, of course, bound up with sex. After puberty, this is what the night comes to mean. Sex, sex, sex. Suddenly this tyrant takes over the imagination and the unfettered sensuality of the darkness is subjugated by an insistent lust. One struggles to understand that thing that has found you out in the dead of night. You struggle with yourself and, in clumsy encounters, with others. Awkwardly dancing between desire and embarrassment. I grew up feeling very uncomfortable about my sexuality, but thankfully the night confided with its own confusions and gave me the confidence to act, to make mistakes, and not to care too much about the blushing dawn. </p> <p>And then, when you do find somebody, you sleep with them. This has always seemed to me more intimate than sex. To share that close unconscious time with another. For a while, it's marvellous to be curled up in post-coital bliss with someone you feel sure you're in love with. But as the night wears on and they snore or encroach upon your space, it's easy to begin to resent them. I have to confess that in this respect, I'm not very good in bed. The fact that the longest relationship I ever had was with an insomniac might have something to do with it. </p> <p>We are never more certain of things than when we are sleeping.

Jamie had in fact died two weeks before, something that my conscious mind was sluggishly aware of but had only informed my sleeping self halfway through our conversation. So in the dream, I had to make sense of this. All sorts of unwelcome thoughts posed themselves, metaphysical speculations that I'd normally have no truck with.

If sleep is interrupted, insufficient or unsatisfactory, the tiredness that it causes can prompt feelings of depression and irritability, as well as dramatically lowering the libido. Scientific research emphasises the importance of sleep: according to Dr Chiara, of the University of Bergen, Norway, an alarming number of adults suffer from sleep deprivation, which not only causes a productivity loss at work of up to 30 per cent, but also a significant deterioration in the quality of their personal lives. Many people, seasoned insomniacs especially, are preoccupied by their ongoing need for a good night's sleep.</p> <p>If you have trouble sleeping, the following nutritional tips may help. Starchy foods, such as pasta, rice, polenta, potatoes and bread, encourage the body to produce sleep-promoting hormones, whereas eating fatty, fried and sugary foods or drinking hot chocolate or coffee late at night (the caffeine in a late-afternoon cup can keep you awake) may result in sleep-disrupting hormonal swings and indigestion, especially if you also have a sensitive digestion or suffer from a stomach ulcer or hiatus hernia. If your digestion is a weak spot, eating late at night and then lying prone in bed makes it difficult for your stomach to digest food efficiently and also causes its contents to leak back into the oesophagus, leading to heartburn. Eating earlier should help, as should sleeping with your head propped up high on a pillow (the pull of gravity means that food will stay in your stomach). If you suffer from acidic indigestion, having a plain biscuit before going to bed will absorb any excess acid, helping you to sleep well. Do not, however, have a milky drink before going to bed: although milk initially has a cooling effect, it prompts the gut to produce excessive amounts of acid.</p> <p><b> Nutrition news </b></p> <p><b> The milk route</b><br> A cup of hot milk before bed can pay dividends for those who have hypertension (high blood pressure), despite worries that consuming dairy products will increase blood cholesterol. The truth is that restricting your intake of calcium, which is found in dairy products (and, to a lesser extent, in oily fish, nuts and green, leafy vegetables), may compromise your body's ability to maintain its blood pressure at a healthy level. Recent research carried out at Carabobo University, Venezuela, published in The Journal of Human Hypertension, concludes that those who suffer from hypertension should ensure that their diet contains 800mg of calcium a day. This requirement can be met by consuming 750ml of milk (skimmed milk contains slightly more calcium than full-cream milk) or 400g of yogurt a day. If you can't eat dairy products, discuss taking a calcium supplement with your doctor or dietician.</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>I often come home late from work and seldom have the inclination or appetite to eat anything.

Forcing your body to endure long periods of starvation can cause your metabolic rate to drop, so that when you finally have some food, it is likely to be converted into fat (which is why some overweight people have trouble losing weight when they eat only one meal a day). In the short term, if you go to bed without eating anything, you'll usually wake up feeling exhausted and fuzzy-headed.

      "body": "<p><strong> Rachel Hopper</strong>, the Capital Radio disc jockey, broadcasts between 1am and 4am - the period which is known in the trade as 'the graveyard shift'. She arrives at the Capital studio, in Leicester Square, at around midnight. In the square, throngs of people, drunk and shouting, are making their way home. When they get home, some of these people will be her listeners. 'You look out of the window,' says Rachel, 'and it's so busy. You suddenly think, \"Oh my God - there's a lot of people. This is London. There's a lot of people listening.\" But you can't think like that, because you'd freak yourself out.' </p> <p>Broadcasting in the middle of the night is typically for the jocks on the way up, or jocks whose careers are faltering. Who can forget Smashie and Nicey, Harry Enfield's disc jockey characters, when they were relegated to the graveyard shift, or the pathos of Alan Partridge when he did the job? A jock on the graveyard shift knows, in theory, that people are listening. But why? They are listening because they have not gone to sleep, or because they can't go to sleep, because they are drunk or drugged, because they have been partying and want to continue partying at home. They are people of the night. Some are shift workers. Some are lost souls. Hopper's job is to talk to these lost souls, to receive their calls, to soothe them with music. It's not an easy thing to do.</p> <p>Hopper is on the way up - her career as a radio presenter is in its infancy. She won't tell me her age, but she says, 'Can I just say I'm in my twenties?' She wants to preserve 'that radio mystique thing'. She is small and pretty, and wears jeans and a tight jumper. </p> <p>Her policy - the station's policy - is to be cheerful, and to play upbeat pop music, as if she were broadcasting during the day. This is a world where the day ends at 4am, at which point the next morning begins, with the 'early breakfast show'. Hopper says, 'I hate those women on the radio with husky voices who go, \"Hi, here's another love song.\" I could never do that, because I haven't got the voice, for a start.' </p> <p>Last night she went to a party and stood in the corner with 'my one beer' because she had to work later. 'All my friends can go out and get blasted, but I can't. When I've got a real party head on, I can't really go for it because I've got to go to work. But I still see friends in the evening and go to gigs and the cinema. And then when my friends go home to bed, I go to work.' </p> <p>She prepares her show alone, in an empty office, flipping through magazines and press releases for tidbits to talk about. 'I usually go out of an evening,' she tells me, 'so what I tend to talk about is what I've been doing, who I've been out with.' </p> <p>Tonight, she thinks she might talk about a girlfriend of hers who got drunk and chipped her tooth on a beer bottle. She takes calls from listeners, but does not broadcast them live, in case the callers are drunk or obscene. Instead, she broadcasts edited versions of the best calls. Suddenly animated, she tells me, 'I had a couple of people last night who rang me at half past three. They said, \"We're stranded, we're trying to get a bus.\" I said, \"It's half past three in the morning - you're not going to get a bus, are you? Get a taxi.\" I was thinking, \"Oh, you nutters!\" I actually said it. I said, \"You're a pair of nuts, aren't you?\" They said, \"We've got a radio, we just can't get a taxi.\" I thought that was priceless. Really good stuff.' </p> <p>The show begins. Hopper sits in the Capital studio, on the same chair which Chris Tarrant will be sitting on in five hours' time, for the breakfast show, and which Neil 'Foxy' Fox will sit on in the early evening, for 'drivetime'. But this is the graveyard shift; an air of strangeness is definitely closing in. Before she talks, Hopper spins records by Eminem, Madonna and All Saints. And then, after bravely introducing herself, she speaks into the void. 'This girl was, how shall I put it, the worse for wear,' she says. 'She'll be seeing the dentist at 9.30 this morning!'</p> <p> For Hopper, this is the realisation of a dream. She has wanted to be a disc jockey for as long as she can remember. She grew up near Barrow-in-Furness, where her mother presented a show on Radio Cumbria. Hopper helped around the station, sometimes scripting the travel news. At Warwick University, where she read theatre studies, Hopper haunted the student radio station, where she was arts editor. 'I spent my entire life up there,' she says. 'It was a bit sad, really, now I look back.' She has spent a lifetime listening obsessively to disc jockeys - Simon Bates with his 'dark chocolate' voice, and Jackie Brambles, the pioneering female jock. Hopper has a theory that female disc jockeys are changing - whereas they used to have sexy voices, to appeal to men, now they are 'real women - sometimes they might be sexy, and sometimes they might be giggling or whatever. Now they can just be themselves.'</p> <p> Listeners call in every few minutes. Hopper answers with exemplary cheerfulness. 'Hello, mate! You're driving a bus in Ilford? Should you be talking to me when you're driving a bus in Ilford?' A woman phones to say she is stressed about her job. A man calls and does a turn impersonating a character from The Simpsons . 'I like it,' Hopper tells him, 'though you're beginning to sound like Prince Charles.' Meanwhile, she plays an advert for a dandruff product. People must be sitting in rooms, alone and wondering why, brushing scurf off their collars. It is the middle of the night. Hopper cues records and ads, edits phone calls, and plans what she's going to say between records. It's a non-stop job. She has worked out that she can rush to the loo and back in the time it takes to play a single. Sometimes she cuts it fine. But this is another advantage of working on the graveyard shift - during the day, she explains, when the building is full, going to the loo would take longer.</p> <p> She loves talking to people. This is what drives her. She's never stuck for something to say. But the night-time atmosphere, the sense of loneliness and desperation, is impossible to escape. She needs to tell people things which contain the perfect note, things which are trivial and uplifting. 'I'm probably going to talk about the weather in a minute,' Hopper tells me, 'and the fact that I still stink of chlorine five hours after going swimming.' </p> <p>Soon, she will explain to her listeners that her friend Simon 'said that there are two things that he admires about Kate Winslet, and I won't repeat them'. As the night wears on, she settles into a winning rhythm of gentle mania. 'People say, \"You sound too awake; it's obscene\",' she says. 'But I really am that awake. I try not to have too much coffee.' Staying up late, she says, is less disruptive than getting up early. At 4am she will hand over to James Cannon, the early breakfast man, take a taxi back to her flat in Tufnell Park, 'creep up the stairs' so she doesn't wake her flatmate, and be asleep by five. She wakes up at lunchtime and cruises into the day: 'I get to go out late, get up late, be a lady who lunches and do stuff in the evenings. If you think about it, I have a lot more freedom than someone who works 9 to 5.'</p> <p> <strong> Vicky Marsden</strong>, the graveyard broadcaster on Radio One, is a blonde, Amazonian 26-year-old who can hardly contain her energy. On weekday nights, it takes her 45 minutes to drive into the Radio One studio in Great Portland Street, London, from her rented house in Surrey. As a night-time broadcaster, she tells me, 'You can maybe get away with a little bit more than you could during the day. I'd possibly think twice about saying some of the things that I say at 3 o'clock in the morning in comparison to 3 o'clock in the afternoon.' Marsden likes to do what she calls a 'music-intensive' show, with fast, snappy links. 'Keep it moving, keep it flowing, keep it pacy,' she says. The Vicky Marsden show is a party. 'They listen when they've come back from a night out,' she says. 'The party carries on at home.' </p> <p>What Marsden brings to the night is a robust sense of humour, the sort of talk you might hear towards the beginning of a drinking session. As a child, she says, her school reports spoke of a girl who 'doesn't shut up in class, she talks too much, she distracts everybody, she's restless, she's fidgety, she doesn't concentrate properly'. Marsden was a tomboy, and idolised her older brother. 'If he was out in the garden climbing trees and having pine-cone fights,' she says, 'then I wanted to do that.' Academically, she 'did quite well up to a point, and then I lost interest a lot. I think I've already mentioned a couple of times I'm quite restless and quite fidgety.'</p> <p>After school, she studied public relations and management at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, thinking she'd work in the music industry. She loves rock music; when talking bands she favours, she often says, 'They rock.' Her favourite disc jockey is Simon Mayo. 'His sense of humour really appeals to me. His style really appeals to me.' She also likes Mark and Lard, who she listened to when she was doing revision for her finals. Her listeners, she says, are 'quite sharp, they know what they want, they know what they're talking about - if you were fake, or if you were a persona, they'd be able to tell'. </p> <p>Marsden's life changed dramatically when she took two years out of her course to serve an internship at a radio station in Hartford, Connecticut. 'It was fantastic,' she says. 'One day, my boss said, \"Do you fancy doing a show?\"' So she played 'music of the guitar rock-based variety', starting on the graveyard shift and graduating to midday. Later, she returned to Preston, where Mark and Lard helped get her through her exams, and spent a restless few years working on radio stations in Dunstable, Leicester and Ayia Napa. She tries to be unfazed by being on national radio: 'You imagine that maybe there's one person who's up, or there are five people who are up, and one of them is your mum, who's up making a cup of tea or something.'</p> <p>Her working hours, she says, do not present a problem. At least she has the evenings: 'I actually feel like I have more of a life now than I did in my previous life when I did six to 10 in the evening.' After the show, she drives back to the house she shares with a flatmate and sleeps until lunchtime. Although 'it can be a bit peculiar if you go out on a date. There have been a couple of times I've been out on dates with people and I've looked at the time and said, \"OK, got to go, I have to do a radio show now.\" And he's just like, \"What?\", that's bizarre for him. I don't know if that's because they think you're going to go and tell the nation what you've been doing_ Mind you, if the date's going really badly, you have a great get-out clause. You can run away to work.'</p> <p>Preparing for her show, which is on air between 2am and 4am, she bats mad, trivial ideas back and forth with Danny, her producer. Danny is Irish and looks about 18. 'Would you rather be blind or legless?' she says. Danny says, 'Legless.' Marsden thinks for a couple of seconds and says, 'Would I rather go to the next family function naked, or come into work naked? Well, the next family function is my brother's wedding. And I'm going to be a bridesmaid. Whereas here, the only person who'd see me naked is Danny. And he wouldn't give a stuff.' Danny likes the idea; Marsden will use it later in the show.</p> <p>When the show starts, she pumps music out into the ether. She flicks the fader up and down, blasting the studio with noise. Danny says, 'Feeder - what do you think?' Marsden says, 'They rock!' She is possessed with a kind of jock mania, a building, ego-involved excitement. She is in the moment. Danny answers the phone. 'What are you doing tonight?' he says. 'And nothing more exciting than that?' </p> <p>They are vetting callers; later in the show, a caller will take part in a competition, live on air. But they have to make sure the caller is at least relatively sensible. The prize is some CDs and a holdall. Danny puts down the phone and relays a request off air. 'Could you say hello to all the truckers in Wolverhampton? This guy says there are about 30 truckers listening to you. He's going to bed.'</p> <p> 'I thought he was a trucker.'</p> <p> 'Truckers have to sleep some time.' Marsden says, 'Sleep's for girls!' </p> <p>She tells me, 'I love what I do, I love my job. I enjoy working at this time of night, because I'm a night-time person. I'm not a morning person. I'm a stay-up-late-at-night person, and that's why I think this show suits my nature.' </p> <p>Kevin, from Watford, is chosen to take part in the quiz. He is staying up, he says, because he's designing a website. On air, Marsden says, 'Is it rude?' Kevin says, 'No.' There is more banter. Marsden asks Kevin to choose a number from one to 10. He chooses seven. 'Lucky seven,' says Marsden. 'A lot of people go for seven. What is it about seven?' There is, in fact, no question number seven - there are just three questions, which Marsden asks anyway. The numbers are to provide drama. 'Theatre of the mind,' she says later, off air. </p> <p>Kevin wins. 'Kev, we salute you,' says Marsden. She rushes out for a cigarette, which she smokes in two minutes, using what she calls 'the old inhale-exhale simultaneously trick'. On her return, she tells the nation that Danny has 'pant issues' - he has put a pair of blue socks in with his white laundry. She says, 'Would you rather go to work naked, or to the next family function naked?' Listeners are asked to phone in. Meanwhile, Marsden pumps out chart hits. She is in a state of controlled daftness. In the studio, a television flickers soundlessly. On screen, a man is mooning. People are making silly faces. Danny says, 'This is why so many people listen to the radio.'</p> <p><strong> Jane Gazzo</strong>, who broadcasts a weekly late-night show on XFM, the indie station, from the top floor of the Capital building in Leicester Square, says, 'I'm driven by music. I think I view myself like a 14-year-old girl. I still get emotional when the lyrics of a song move me, or the pounding beat of drums or a guitar riff makes me want to dance. Yes, I'm very driven by music.' </p> <p>Gazzo, a 26-year-old Australian, hardly plans her shows. 'I'll generally go with the vibe,' she says. Working late doesn't hurt her social life - she can usually see a band and get back in time for a broadcast. Not being able to drink much doesn't matter because she gets 'buzzed' by the music. Sometimes she broadcasts alone, but tonight her friend Debbie, another Australian, is here to keep her company. Jane plays records and talks to callers while Debbie surfs the internet, searching for trivia.</p> <p> It's one o'clock on Saturday morning; outside, the streets are thick with activity, as they will be when Gazzo knocks off in three hours' time. Her banter is sweetly cynical. She says, 'Jane Gazzo on your wireless.' She plays a record by a band called Clem Snide, and says afterwards, 'You've got to love an outfit that takes its name from The Naked Lunch. Clem Snide, the rear end that inspired Burroughs to write.'</p> <p>Obsessed with rock music since the age of five, Gazzo, the daughter of a Melbourne clothes designer, started listening to her local student rock station when she was in her early teens. She loved Blondie and the Clash. 'The girls in my school were into Madonna and Debbie Gibson, all the safe options, and that music just did nothing for me. So I started hanging around the radio station to get closer to the records, to talk to the DJs about the bands I was hearing, because I couldn't talk to anybody else. I was hanging around the station like a bad smell. Then I did a radio production course at the age of 16, and before I finished high school, I had my own two-hour pop-music show called Calamity.'</p> <p>Later, she worked for ABC, Australia's equivalent of the BBC, but sensed that 'this great pulse was calling me to Britain'. And when she got here, she was not disappointed. 'It was so much cooler and hipper. It was about trousers as well as the music.' Gazzo wears short, baggy denim jeans; she has bleached-blonde hair and a riot of jewellery - earrings approaching double figures and several chunky plastic rings. Her boyfriend - who she refers to as an 'artist' - lives in Melbourne. She doesn't get much chance to see him 'but I do a lot of emailing'. </p> <p>On air, she says, 'It's Saturday night, Friday morning, whichever side of the beer glass you're looking at.' She plays songs by Captain Soul and St Etienne, and answers the phone to callers, many of whom are drunk. In the street, a siren blares. A man narrowly avoids being run over. People are staggering and shouting. Debbie says, 'Fifteen per cent of Americans secretly bite their toenails.' Debbie and Gazzo try to find a word which rhymes with 'month', but they can't - the closest they can get is 'bunch'. </p> <p>The phone rings. Gazzo says, 'And you make Milky Bars for a living? Tell us what's in Milky Bars. You spray-dry? Whey dry? Whey powder? So, you work on the construction of Milky Ways - sorry, Milky Bars. Yes, I have heard of the Milky Bar Kid. Of course!' It's the moment that will make the show. The man who works at the milky bar factory! 'He was drunk as a skunk,' Gazzo says. 'That's why I can't put calls to air.' Still, she can explain the call to the listeners in her own words. When she does, the phone rings again. Gazzo says, 'All right, I didn't mention the emulsifier, but I expect most people get the picture.' </p> <p>Debbie says, 'A pregnant goldfish is called a twit. Babies are born without kneecaps.' These, too, are items Gazzo can use.</p> <p> Andy Rayner, the early breakfast man, arrives. 'I liked the Milky Bar stuff,' he says. He's been listening in the car. Gazzo prepares to 'hand over'. She says, 'How was your drive in this morning?' Rayner says, 'It was brisk, it was chilly, but in a Fiesta Diesel you travel in comfort wherever you go.' He has about him the unmistakable air of breakfast banter. Jane Gazzo has shepherded her listeners through another Friday night, another night of loneliness, yearning, desperation, partying, work, and serious drinking. It is 4am. The graveyard shift is over. In the world of radio, another day has dawned.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Hopper, the Capital Radio disc jockey, broadcasts between 1am and 4am - the period which is known in the trade as 'the graveyard shift'. She arrives at the Capital studio, in Leicester Square, at around midnight. In the square, throngs of people, drunk and shouting, are making their way home. When they get home, some of these people will be her listeners. 'You look out of the window,' says Rachel, 'and it's so busy. You suddenly think, \"Oh my God - there's a lot of people. This is London. There's a lot of people listening.\" But you can't think like that, because you'd freak yourself out.' Broadcasting in the middle of the night is typically for the jocks on the way up, or jocks whose careers are faltering. Who can forget Smashie and Nicey, Harry Enfield's disc jockey characters, when they were relegated to the graveyard shift, or the pathos of Alan Partridge when he did the job? A jock on the graveyard shift knows, in theory, that people are listening. But why? They are listening because they have not gone to sleep, or because they can't go to sleep, because they are drunk or drugged, because they have been partying and want to continue partying at home. They are people of the night. Some are shift workers. Some are lost souls. Hopper's job is to talk to these lost souls, to receive their calls, to soothe them with music. It's not an easy thing to do. Hopper is on the way up - her career as a radio presenter is in its infancy. She won't tell me her age, but she says, 'Can I just say I'm in my twenties?' She wants to preserve 'that radio mystique thing'. She is small and pretty, and wears jeans and a tight jumper. Her policy - the station's policy - is to be cheerful, and to play upbeat pop music, as if she were broadcasting during the day. This is a world where the day ends at 4am, at which point the next morning begins, with the 'early breakfast show'. Hopper says, 'I hate those women on the radio with husky voices who go, \"Hi, here's another love song.\" I could never do that, because I haven't got the voice, for a start.' Last night she went to a party and stood in the corner with 'my one beer' because she had to work later. 'All my friends can go out and get blasted, but I can't. When I've got a real party head on, I can't really go for it because I've got to go to work. But I still see friends in the evening and go to gigs and the cinema. And then when my friends go home to bed, I go to work.' She prepares her show alone, in an empty office, flipping through magazines and press releases for tidbits to talk about. 'I usually go out of an evening,' she tells me, 'so what I tend to talk about is what I've been doing, who I've been out with.' Tonight, she thinks she might talk about a girlfriend of hers who got drunk and chipped her tooth on a beer bottle. She takes calls from listeners, but does not broadcast them live, in case the callers are drunk or obscene. Instead, she broadcasts edited versions of the best calls. Suddenly animated, she tells me, 'I had a couple of people last night who rang me at half past three. They said, \"We're stranded, we're trying to get a bus.\" I said, \"It's half past three in the morning - you're not going to get a bus, are you? Get a taxi.\" I was thinking, \"Oh, you nutters!\" I actually said it. I said, \"You're a pair of nuts, aren't you?\" They said, \"We've got a radio, we just can't get a taxi.\" I thought that was priceless. Really good stuff.' The show begins. Hopper sits in the Capital studio, on the same chair which Chris Tarrant will be sitting on in five hours' time, for the breakfast show, and which Neil 'Foxy' Fox will sit on in the early evening, for 'drivetime'. But this is the graveyard shift; an air of strangeness is definitely closing in. Before she talks, Hopper spins records by Eminem, Madonna and All Saints. And then, after bravely introducing herself, she speaks into the void. 'This girl was, how shall I put it, the worse for wear,' she says. 'She'll be seeing the dentist at 9.30 this morning!' For Hopper, this is the realisation of a dream. She has wanted to be a disc jockey for as long as she can remember. She grew up near Barrow-in-Furness, where her mother presented a show on Radio Cumbria. Hopper helped around the station, sometimes scripting the travel news. At Warwick University, where she read theatre studies, Hopper haunted the student radio station, where she was arts editor. 'I spent my entire life up there,' she says. 'It was a bit sad, really, now I look back.' She has spent a lifetime listening obsessively to disc jockeys - Simon Bates with his 'dark chocolate' voice, and Jackie Brambles, the pioneering female jock. Hopper has a theory that female disc jockeys are changing - whereas they used to have sexy voices, to appeal to men, now they are 'real women - sometimes they might be sexy, and sometimes they might be giggling or whatever. Now they can just be themselves.' Listeners call in every few minutes. Hopper answers with exemplary cheerfulness. 'Hello, mate! You're driving a bus in Ilford? Should you be talking to me when you're driving a bus in Ilford?' A woman phones to say she is stressed about her job. A man calls and does a turn impersonating a character from The Simpsons . 'I like it,' Hopper tells him, 'though you're beginning to sound like Prince Charles.' Meanwhile, she plays an advert for a dandruff product. People must be sitting in rooms, alone and wondering why, brushing scurf off their collars. It is the middle of the night. Hopper cues records and ads, edits phone calls, and plans what she's going to say between records. It's a non-stop job. She has worked out that she can rush to the loo and back in the time it takes to play a single. Sometimes she cuts it fine. But this is another advantage of working on the graveyard shift - during the day, she explains, when the building is full, going to the loo would take longer. She loves talking to people.

She wakes up at lunchtime and cruises into the day: 'I get to go out late, get up late, be a lady who lunches and do stuff in the evenings. If you think about it, I have a lot more freedom than someone who works 9 to 5.' Vicky Marsden, the graveyard broadcaster on Radio One, is a blonde, Amazonian 26-year-old who can hardly contain her energy. On weekday nights, it takes her 45 minutes to drive into the Radio One studio in Great Portland Street, London, from her rented house in Surrey. As a night-time broadcaster, she tells me, 'You can maybe get away with a little bit more than you could during the day. I'd possibly think twice about saying some of the things that I say at 3 o'clock in the morning in comparison to 3 o'clock in the afternoon.'

I was hanging around the station like a bad smell. Then I did a radio production course at the age of 16, and before I finished high school, I had my own two-hour pop-music show called Calamity.' Later, she worked for ABC, Australia's equivalent of the BBC, but sensed that 'this great pulse was calling me to Britain'. And when she got here, she was not disappointed. 'It was so much cooler and hipper. It was about trousers as well as the music.' Gazzo wears short, baggy denim jeans; she has bleached-blonde hair and a riot of jewellery - earrings approaching double figures and several chunky plastic rings. Her boyfriend - who she refers to as an 'artist' - lives in Melbourne. She doesn't get much chance to see him 'but I do a lot of emailing'. On air, she says, 'It's Saturday night, Friday morning, whichever side of the beer glass you're looking at.' She plays songs by Captain Soul and St Etienne, and answers the phone to callers, many of whom are drunk. In the street, a siren blares. A man narrowly avoids being run over. People are staggering and shouting. Debbie says, 'Fifteen per cent of Americans secretly bite their toenails.' Debbie and Gazzo try to find a word which rhymes with 'month', but they can't - the closest they can get is 'bunch'. The phone rings. Gazzo says, 'And you make Milky Bars for a living? Tell us what's in Milky Bars. You spray-dry? Whey dry? Whey powder? So, you work on the construction of Milky Ways - sorry, Milky Bars. Yes, I have heard of the Milky Bar Kid. Of course!' It's the moment that will make the show. The man who works at the milky bar factory! 'He was drunk as a skunk,' Gazzo says. 'That's why I can't put calls to air.' Still, she can explain the call to the listeners in her own words. When she does, the phone rings again. Gazzo says, 'All right, I didn't mention the emulsifier, but I expect most people get the picture.' Debbie says, 'A pregnant goldfish is called a twit. Babies are born without kneecaps.' These, too, are items Gazzo can use. Andy Rayner, the early breakfast man, arrives. 'I liked the Milky Bar stuff,' he says. He's been listening in the car. Gazzo prepares to 'hand over'. She says, 'How was your drive in this morning?' Rayner says, 'It was brisk, it was chilly, but in a Fiesta Diesel you travel in comfort wherever you go.' He has about him the unmistakable air of breakfast banter. Jane Gazzo has shepherded her listeners through another Friday night, another night of loneliness, yearning, desperation, partying, work, and serious drinking. It is 4am. The graveyard shift is over. In the world of radio, another day has dawned.",

      "body": "<p>On 19 January this year, the sun emerged over the north Norwegian horizon for the first time in two months. It disappeared in the middle of November. Since then, the small city of Alta, which ribbons along the edge of the deep and craggy Alta fjord, had been cloaked in a murky darkness. </p> <p>Alta is tucked well inside the Arctic Circle, at 69 56'N. As the locals like to tell you, it's as far north of Oslo as Rome is south. It is so far north that a journey there requires three different planes. In the sunless period between November and January, there is an average of just four and three quarter hours of dusky light each day; on 21 December, the shortest day of the year, there is no actual daylight. And either side of that, the days are grey, and the nights are seemingly endless. </p> <p>It has been a mild winter in the north. Piles of dirty snow are slowly melting away like wax. Further inland, an ice hotel had been built (like the one in Sweden which is reconstructed each year for the winter months) but was proving something of a disaster because it began melting as soon as it was finished. </p> <p>Alta is the newest city in Norway. It was given 'city status' on 1 January 2000. It has also, I had heard, been voted the country's ugliest town. A new sports centre is the city's most popular meeting place. In the evenings, it is packed with members doing aerobics classes, working out on the running machines and meeting to socialise over a few coffees. There is an added attraction: the Lyskafe, or Light Caf\u00e9. Along with their sandwich and coffee, customers can now blast themselves with a little light therapy. On each of the tables, there is a Philips lamp (they call it the Original Bright Light) which delivers 10,000 lux (the technical measure of brightness) without harmful UV rays. At least 2,500 lux is recommended - five times brighter than a well-lit office. </p> <p>Bente Fagerthum, the centre's manager, advises about 20 minutes to half an hour each day, time she spends reading a paper or magazine so the light is bounced from the paper into her eyes. The centre's sunbeds are already popular. An all-round tan is not uncommon for young Norwegian women. But the Bright Light is thought to reduce secretions of melatonin, the hormone from the pineal gland at the base of the brain which controls our sleeping patterns. Regular users say they feel more energetic about getting up in the morning. The lamp can help reduce insomnia, a common problem during the dark winter months. The lamps are still a novelty in Norway, but at around \u00a3280 a throw, they look set to become as much a part of Norwegian home life as cosy candle light, waffles and brown cheese. </p> <p>Niels Westphal, who works at Alta town hall as an information consultant, lives outside Alta in an idyllic spot on the edge of the fjord in woodland, with his wife Trine, who is an artist and illustrator, and their three children. For the past few months, he has been enjoying the benefit of some light therapy at the office. 'It's supposed to be like daylight,' he says. 'It's very strong light. I didn't use it over the Christmas holidays but have been using it the past two days and I'm feeling quite good.' Niels is originally from southern Norway, where the winter nights are not quite so long, but moved to Alta two years ago for his job. Trine was born in Alta but went to art school in Oslo. 'It's a challenge to move back,' she says. Living and housing is cheaper in Alta - especially outside the city. One of the consolations of living in the far north of Norway is that land is cheap. Next to their house, Trine has her own atelier - a new wooden construction that she designed herself. Originally there was an old wood storehouse on the land. 'It was depressing not having a place to work. This has made me feel much more optimistic.' For an artist, there is not so much pressure to make money. And the luxury of building your own studio is not a fantasy. </p> <p>'It was important to me to have light,' she says, opening some Ritz biscuits for a teatime snack. 'I spent months trying to work out where the press should be and where I should have space for painting.' The southern corner of the studio has windows and a skylight. There is also a lot of artificial daylight. 'The skylight gives midday light. It affects the way I paint. In winter, the colours are lighter, quieter and more sombre. In the light summer months, I tend to introduce expressive, brighter colours.' </p> <p>Behind her comfy old sofa hangs one of her winter paintings, a watery mass of greys, lilacs and chilly blues. 'I enjoy contrast,' she says. That's what she likes about living in Alta. She enjoys the snow and darkness in winter and the fact that there is so much nature close by in the summer, when she can take the children swimming in the fjord or walking in the woods. </p> <p>The structure of the atelier is typically Norwegian, with its timber frame and efficient insulation. Inside, it is neat and tidy. The work in progress has been put away for the night, although if she is particularly busy or has an exhibition to prepare for, Trine will happily work into the early hours. When she feels too isolated or quiet in her hideaway, she simply runs a few steps across the snow into the family home where, with three children and a dog, there is usually noise and bustle. </p> <p>As a result of the long nights, Norwegians are very good at making their homes cosy. The Noodt house is no exception. Niels is busy at his computer in the study. The living room is big and spacious, with a mishmash of furniture, old and new, and Trine's paintings decorating the walls. Everywhere is well lit. Most Norwegian homes seem to have candles hanging in the windows, making them look welcoming on a dark and cold night. There is a wood burner in one corner, but despite the fact that it is snowing outside, it is not lit. It's warm enough with just the heat from the small electric radiators. </p> <p>Trine and her family appear to be well acclimatised to living inside the Arctic Circle. However, not everyone adjusts well. People have been known to go out fixing their cars by torchlight in the early hours, and there are stories of real insomniacs getting so confused that they turn up for afternoon tea with friends at 4am rather than 4pm. </p> <p>Andi Weydahl researches the effects of darkness on people's behaviour and sleeping patterns. We meet in the canteen at Finnmark College, where she teaches physical education, mid-afternoon and already the twilight has faded. She is very excited about a rare meteorological phenomenon called mother-of-pearl clouds that has been hovering in the sky all day. On windy days, when ice crystals form at a high level, they catch reflections of sunlight. It is like oil shimmering on water in clear bright pinks, blues and unearthly greens. Andi keeps looking out of the plate-glass window, catching the last glimpses of the strange cloud formations. 'I was here 10 years before I saw mother-of-pearl clouds,' she says. </p> <p>She's lived in Alta since 1977 and is still fascinated by the tricks the Arctic sky can play. 'The first year I was here, I had some problems getting to sleep and was getting up at 5am, changing car tyres and doing crazy things,' says Andi. 'The real problems come if you don't have a 24-hour body clock. It can range between 23 to 25 hours. If you're a 25-hour person, you eventually go completely out of kilter.' It's a bit like having permanent jet lag. </p> <p>Andi estimates that one third of the local population has insomnia problems. Her recent research has been looking at the effects of the northern lights on sleeping patterns. Saliva samples are taken at regular intervals and sent off to be measured for levels of melatonin. In times of intense geo-magnetic activity, when the polar sky becomes a light show, it appears that less melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. 'Low levels of melatonin will influence glucose levels and sleeping patterns,' she says. </p> <p>Andi questions whether depression is the right word for the way the people of Alta sometimes feel during the winter. 'Maybe we have more time to sit and think about life in general during the dark period,' she says. 'It doesn't necessarily mean that we are depressed, or suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder. The problem is that people think it goes away when the sun comes back. But when it gets to be February or March, the feeling is still there.' </p> <p>Andi herself is sprightly enough, despite the fact that the teachers' common rooms are lit by the glow of candle light, without a special lamp in sight. 'In the midnight sun, people say all we do is fish and make love. The only difference in the dark period is that we don't fish.' And as she laughs, the last remaining luminous pearly cloud disappears from the sky, and Alta is once more in darkness, the only light reflecting from the street lamps on to the whiteness of the day's snowfall on the pavements below.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Molly climbs up the little stepladder and puts her eye to the monster telescope poking up at the heavens from Reeds school's playing field in Surrey. Her breath balloons in the frozen air. </p> <p>Star-gazing is a very personal thing - your naked eye locks on to the target zillions of miles away. Or it doesn't. A nudge, a twitch of the focus too far, and what you are supposed to be seeing vanishes, quillions of miles off target. So you are on your own. </p> <p>'Can you see it, Molly?' </p> <p>'I can see a white thing.' Molly, at eight years, has to twiddle the focus for herself. </p> <p>The tension is unbearable. A shooting star whizzes in. Molly misses it, concentrating on the telescope. Then, 'Yes, yes, yes! It's a ring. I can see a ring...' </p> <p>There is no sight more beautiful in all the heavens than Saturn. It is mind-thumpingly amazing and worth the wait, and the cold, even if you are eight. </p> <p>Molly's knowledge of Keats isn't what it should be. She didn't say 'Then felt I like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken', but she did jump up and down and say 'I've seen Saturn' in a way I shall remember for the rest of my life. </p> <p>It was a wow! For me too, and I am considerably older. But even better was seeing Saturn in the cheap and cheerful, \u00a3100-telescope Santa had got my son Sam. The brilliant ring surrounding the mysterious planet sat plonk in the middle of the eyepiece. You can get cheaper ones in high-street shops, such as Dixons, or go up-market and spend \u00a3300. Before you do that, it's sensible to go out with your local astronomy group and see if you like it. </p> <p>You might be put off the thought of stargazing if you live in a built-up area. Streetlights do knock out deep space observation, but not the planets or the moon. Jupiter is, right now, extraordinarily bright, probably the most lit-up thing in the sky. </p> <p>Gavin Stacey, from the Guildford Astronomical Society is our host. He is totally smitten with the stars, an absolute fanatic. In front of us is his Leviathan, a \u00a35,000 transportable telescope, capable of looking halfway back into the universe's time and space and checking out the nebulae. Gavin is the enthusiasts' enthusiast, chatting so rapidly about the ancients and the stars and the planets and deep space that one is a little lost. He comes across like Patrick Moore on speed. You begin to laugh, and then you see Saturn swim into view and are humbled and awed by the majesty of the outer limits. </p> <p>Star-gazing is an ancient occupation. But modernity crashed in when Galileo used one of the new-fangled telescopes to clock Jupiter and its rings, and discovered three moons. Then along came others with better telescopes, such as Huygens, who first saw Saturn's rings, and Newton and much later Hubble. It was Hubble who destroyed the fundamental principles of the old astronomy, and in his honour Nasa named its pride and joy after him. The Hubble Deep Field telescope picked up 40 billion new galaxies, expanding the known universe from 10 billion galaxies upwards into an unimaginable number of stars and planets. </p> <p>Your amateur stargazer need not get into the serious numbers. What is lovely is looking at the planets and the stars, and feeling cold and scientific and questing. A cheap and cheerful telescope is fine to begin with. The problem is not the sights within the 'scope but the stand. Most cheap telescopes work on the basis that you clock the target with a low magnification lens, then change up to a higher and higher power. The problem is that the tripod on a cheap 'scope is pretty rickety. A single nudge off-centre, which can easily happen, and you are looking not at Saturn but at the Birmingham Inner Ring Road. But you can still see amazing things with low magnification. It's probably better to stay on low magnification and enjoy looking at what you can see easily than spend the evening fiddling about hopelessly. </p> <p>The other strange thing to understand is that the planets wander across the sky with a speed which is faintly shocking. The ancient Greeks called the planets after their word for 'wanderers'. And they were right. In a telescope such as Gavin's, Saturn moves so quickly across the sky that you have to nudge the scope along to track the planet every minute or so. Duffers get caught out. </p> <p>Once affected, you can feel the contagion of the stargazing bug bite. Gavin used to be a normal human being. Then his long-suffering wife bought him a book on astronomy. A little telescope followed. Now he has a \u00a35,000 monster, so big he can look far away at nebulae, but so beautifully designed that it can pack away into the boot of his estate. As my kids and I started to shiver and shake, Gavin pointed to Betelgeuse: 'Let's see if we can get a good look.' </p> <p>I am, I fear, two stone overweight and I was wearing a Thinsulate hat and gloves, a Serbian secret policeman's coat with acrylic fur collar and a Chechen lambs' wool overcoat and still I was cold. At night you have to be dedicated, or slightly bonkers. Gavin wasn't even wearing a coat. 'The trick is to wear silk socks,' he said. </p> <p>Gavin and his friends can spend all night until 6am watching the skies. The kids and I are very much on the less fanatical fringe, but the next time there is a clear night and a bloody moon or Saturn high in the sky we'll be there, barbecued sausages in hand, screwing up our eyes at the telescope, full of awe.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Popstars</strong> ITV <br> <strong>Adrian Mole, The Cappuccino Years</strong> BBC1 <br> <strong>Rebel Heart</strong> BBC1 <br> <strong>Second Sight</strong> BBC1 <br></p> <p> As it's broadcast on Saturdays and tapes are generally unavailable in time for my Friday deadline, not being able to write about Popstars has made for a frustrating three weeks. But thanks to ITV squeezing an extra hour of the show into last Wednesday's schedule and then hastily dispatching me the first of last night's two shows, I've finally got my big break. </p> <p> By now, Wednesday's 10 finalists - Danny, Jessica, Kevin, Kelli, Kym, Michelle, Myleene, Noel, Suzanne and Tony - have been whittled down by the judging panel - 'Nasty' Nigel (actually a sweetie), Paul and Nikki - to the final five. Even as I write, they are living a sort of Monkees-like existence in a celebrity safe house. If, that is, the tabloids haven't already unearthed them. It's been white-knuckle TV all the way. </p> <p>Plundering the best 'hey-kids, let's-do-the-show right here!' musical plots, Popstars is A Chorus Line , 42nd Street and Fame, lit by the brutal spotlight of reality TV. The first couple of shows followed nationwide auditions for singers-who-dance and dancers-who-sing, with hilarious emphasis on the death-by karaoke crash-and-burn of numerous profoundly talentless hairbrush-wielding Ricky Martins and showerhead-waving Robbie Williamses. Ah, already I feel nostalgic for Robbie's 'Angels' as interpreted by a selection of potently spotty young men shouting flatly or sharply (sometimes both simultaneously): 'Anthrooit AHWWL she ovARSE Meee ProTEKshun/ Aliddleluvan affekshun/WedderahmrideorRRROONG'. </p> <p> Though the hopeless boys were invariably funnier than the hopeless girls (mostly mangling S Club 7's 'Reach! for the Staaarrrs!'), you had to admire their collective gall. Last week, though, the laughter gave way to several Man-Sized Kleenex moments. It was horribly tough on the kids who made it into the last 23 and then the last 14 before being told by Nigel Lythgoe that they had 'won the silver medal, not the gold'. Ian, for example, sang much better than Tony, but the singing coach thought that 'Ian would be better off selling me a used car'. So Ian was history and Tony was in. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Taz enthused to the judges about how much he'd enjoyed the fake press conference as Paul gently interjected 'Taz, mate...' He was out and he looked firstly numb, then desperate. </p> <p> Happily, all this violence took its toll on the judges too: 'What must they be going through in that other room?' wondered Nikki, snuffling. 'The plan tomorrow is to wear waterproof mascara.' After the charming, gracious Raymond was given the elbow but composed himself sufficiently to shake the judges' hands, they all cried and so did I. </p> <p> What they were going through in the other room was some pretty intense bonding. After each of the kids emerged with the judges' verdict, the others offered their generous support, so when it came to raw rollercoaster emotions, Popstars was pretty much to Fame what Apocalypse Now is to Caddyshack . But far from putting off any sofa-bound popstar wannabes, I should think the show will only fuel their desire for stardom, however statistically dismal their prospects: after all, every one of Wednesday's boys was a better singer than Ronan Keating, and all of the girls a cuter bunch of belters than the Spice Bints. </p> <p> For the record, then, after the first of last night's programmes, my Fickle Finger of Fame had picked: Jessica (the girl next door with the 'great personality, very bright, very honest and very sexy-looking'), Kelli ('looks like a model, dances brilliantly, sings really well'), Suzanne ('our only blonde'), Danny (the boy next door: 'such star quality but there's humility there') and Kevin ('what a jawline, and a very strong voice'). Then again, Myleene is deliriously pretty, and Noel does have a certain sweet something... </p> <p>I could envisage the younger Adrian Mole entering a Popstars audition accidentally while accompanying the lovely Pandora Braithwaite, but despite a promisingly thespian start to her career ('who could forget Pandora's performance as Mary in the school nativity? It was her idea to give Jesus a forceps delivery...') instead of becoming Ashby de la Zouche's answer to Posh Spice, Pandora has grown up in The Cappuccino Years to be both Helen Baxendale and a Blair Babe with a PhD, while Adrian is now thirty-and-a-half, a divorced father-of-one and 'offal chef to the stars'. </p> <p> Needless to say, he's still besotted by Pandora, even though she treats him like something sticky on the sole of her designer shoes: 'Sorry, Ady, I've turned into a bit of a monster since I got into politics... perhaps you could be my Voice of Little England?' </p> <p> After 16 years, this very welcome six-part return to the world of Mole (formerly on ITV but now on BBC1) stars newcomer Stephen Mangan (whatever happened to young Gian Sammarco, I wonder? Maybe he grew up to become an offal chef to the stars...) as the eponymous diarist and has kicked off in fine style. The cast is excellent (Alison Steadman as Pauline Mole, Zoe Wanamaker as Tania Braithwaite and Keith Allen as Mole's boss at Hoi-Polloi), while Sue Townsend's script is as finely tuned as one would hope. Already, six parts seems insufficient. </p> <p> One quibble, though: The Cappuccino Years indulges in the current trend for having real people play themselves, irritating actors in the process and pleasing budget-juggling producers no end (there are future guest appearances by the never-knowingly-shy-of-publicity Max Clifford and Antony Worrall Thompson). Yet in the first episode, both the 'A.A. Gill' and the 'George Michael' definitely weren't quite themselves. None the less, Mole does very well without them. Rebel Heart came to its bloody conclusion last week. No surprise, really, because the wide-eyed, sweet-faced James D'Arcy, as fictional Irish Republican Army hero Ernie Coyne, always had the look of a potential victim about him. Still, at least he died laughing - jarring if only because he hadn't done much laughing in the preceding 195 minutes. Having opted not to use a narrative voiceover (which would have helped those of us whose historical knowledge of the birth of the IRA is less than thesis-worthy), I found Rebel Heart less controversial than it was confusing. And though beautifully acted and never less than lovely to look at, by the end of the journey it was increasingly hard to engage with the drama, perhaps because - and from whichever side one sympathises - the IRA's real-life recent past is always going to be much more powerfully emotive than a costumed history lesson. </p> <p> Increasingly, Second Sight suffers from an identity crisis even greater than that of its central character, Clive Owen's Detective Chief Inspector Ross Tanner, who has a nasty virus that has dramatically affected his eyesight. So dramatically, in fact, that it's now affecting our own. When we see through Tanner's eyes-as-a-camera it's the world viewed as if from the bottom of a couple of bottles of nasty plonk. Queasy-making stuff, then, even without the bloody plotlines. </p> <p>Last week's was quite a promising plot though: Labour peer's daughter wakes at her home to find herself covered in blood, while the body of her baseball-batted fianc\u00e9 is found at his home. From the off, she was so obviously guilty that I looked forward to the inevitable twists and cul-de-sacs that would lead us to who had really dunnit. Except that in the end she really had dunnit, which was pretty boring. At the heart of of the show's identity crisis is the fact that it hasn't decided whether to settle for being a detective thriller with few thrills, or a psychological drama that focuses on Tanner's increasingly skewed ability to do his job, while managing to pull off both is, presumably, above and beyond the call of duty. </p> <p> This is a shame because I feel sure there's a gap in the prime-time market for a blind, secretive, psychologically troubled yet very handsome Detective Chief Inspector with nice leather jackets, who can still score a very creditable 73 per cent in his firearms refresher course even without the assistance of his guide dog. And did we really need the clunking soundtrack - 'I Can See Clearly Now' while Tanner solves the murder and 'Hello Darkness My Old Friend' while he hit the bottle in self-pity. Though it could have been worse, I suppose - he could have sung them at a karaoke night. </p> <p> Which reminds me: on second sight I've decided that Suzanne might not make it into the band and Myleene might. And since Kevin is already in a band called Force Five and has been on Stars in their Eyes ('nothing really came of it. I was devastated'), surely it's the lovely Noel's turn to get his big break? Never mind being a Popstar, who'd wannabe a popstar picker?</p>",

      "body": "<p>The official biography of Sir Laurens van der Post, the South African writer and late spiritual mentor of Prince Charles, is to reveal a life full of political intrigue, colourful fantasy - and the growing fear of scandal.</p> <p>The book, due to be published this autumn, draws from the writer's personal archive for the first time, uncovering facts that he was determined not to see in print in his lifetime.</p> <p>Documents found by the biographer J D F Jones, have confirmed allegations that Van der Post had a secret child after an illicit affair with a 14-year-old girl. After the author's death in 1996, Cari Mostert sensationally came forward to claim she was his illegitimate daughter and that her underage mother had been seduced during a boat trip to England.</p> <p>'It was one of the great nightmares of his life that this would come out,' Jones told The Observer last week. 'But I cannot write a proper life story without examining it.'</p> <p>His researches have also uncovered the fact that Van der Post spoke regularly to Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands conflict. 'He certainly called her up right throughout the war, the understanding being that he would rally her whenever he could. He was very close to her for a long period,' said Jones.</p> <p>The news that Van der Post guided the Prime Minister through some of her most difficult decisions during the campaign is a surprise to the writer's legally recognised daughter, the executor of his estate, Lucia Van der Post.</p> <p>'I knew they were good friends and that he had helped in the Lancaster House negotiations with Zimbabwe in 1981, but I had no idea that he had continued to talk to her so regularly,' she said.</p> <p>A spokesman for Thatcher confirmed Jones's findings. 'They certainly spoke to each other a lot in private. He was a moral support to her, even though he did not know anything specifically about the South Atlantic. It was really all about their friendship. She had a lot of respect for a great many things he had to say.'</p> <p>Jones was appointed biographer by Lucia Van der Post after consultation with her father's friends, but she stressed last week that she had no powers of censorship over the text, nor would she want them.</p> <p>'I am sure the text will include many things I didn't know about,' she said. 'As to his affairs, well, I have no doubt, living to the age he did, that my father led an extraordinary life.'</p> <p>Three days after he died at the age of 90, rumours surfaced of his affair with a 14-year-old girl, and his alleged rejection of their child.</p> <p>Mostert claimed her mother had been seduced by Van der Post, who was more than three times her age, after she had been entrusted to his care. She described the explorer's tears when they first met, and alleged he had refused to answer her letters.</p> <p>The affair took place five years after Van der Post's second marriage to Ingaret Giffard in 1949, when the girl, Bonnie, travelled to London to become a ballet dancer. Only a few weeks after her arrival in England she went back, pregnant, to South Africa. Jones's research has shown the writer did, however, make financial provision for the baby, arranging to support her until she was 18 by secret deed of covenant.</p> <p>Van der Post was a fantasist who embellished the facts of his life. 'I don't really know why he did it,' said Jones. 'It was mainly on questions of his background. He was a great storyteller in every element of his life. He used to say that he was born 1,001 miles away from the sea, but in fact he was born 325 miles from the sea. Fabrication came naturally to him.'</p> <p>'The Great White Bushman', as Van der Post came to be known, started out as a journalist in Durban and married his first wife, Marjorie Wendt, in 1928. He travelled between Africa and England before writing his first novel, In A Province, in 1934.</p> <p>During the Second World War he served in Ethiopia, the Western Desert and Burma, before being captured in Java by the Japanese and held for three years. His writings on his captivity were the basis of the film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence .</p> <p>After the war, Van der Post worked with Lord Mountbatten and left the Army as a colonel, with an OBE and a CBE.</p> <p>In the 1950s his literary reputation was secured with the novels The Lost World of the Kalahari and The Heart of the Hunter. He became friends with statesmen, thinkers and business moguls, including Sir James Goldsmith and the founding father of psychotherapy, Carl Gustav Jung. He was asked to become godfather to Prince William.</p> <p>'It is an extraordinary story,' says Jones.

      "bodyText": "The official biography of Sir Laurens van der Post, the South African writer and late spiritual mentor of Prince Charles, is to reveal a life full of political intrigue, colourful fantasy - and the growing fear of scandal. The book, due to be published this autumn, draws from the writer's personal archive for the first time, uncovering facts that he was determined not to see in print in his lifetime. Documents found by the biographer J D F Jones, have confirmed allegations that Van der Post had a secret child after an illicit affair with a 14-year-old girl. After the author's death in 1996, Cari Mostert sensationally came forward to claim she was his illegitimate daughter and that her underage mother had been seduced during a boat trip to England. 'It was one of the great nightmares of his life that this would come out,' Jones told The Observer last week. 'But I cannot write a proper life story without examining it.' His researches have also uncovered the fact that Van der Post spoke regularly to Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands conflict. 'He certainly called her up right throughout the war, the understanding being that he would rally her whenever he could. He was very close to her for a long period,' said Jones. The news that Van der Post guided the Prime Minister through some of her most difficult decisions during the campaign is a surprise to the writer's legally recognised daughter, the executor of his estate, Lucia Van der Post. 'I knew they were good friends and that he had helped in the Lancaster House negotiations with Zimbabwe in 1981, but I had no idea that he had continued to talk to her so regularly,' she said. A spokesman for Thatcher confirmed Jones's findings. 'They certainly spoke to each other a lot in private. He was a moral support to her, even though he did not know anything specifically about the South Atlantic. It was really all about their friendship. She had a lot of respect for a great many things he had to say.' Jones was appointed biographer by Lucia Van der Post after consultation with her father's friends, but she stressed last week that she had no powers of censorship over the text, nor would she want them. 'I am sure the text will include many things I didn't know about,' she said. 'As to his affairs, well, I have no doubt, living to the age he did, that my father led an extraordinary life.' Three days after he died at the age of 90, rumours surfaced of his affair with a 14-year-old girl, and his alleged rejection of their child. Mostert claimed her mother had been seduced by Van der Post, who was more than three times her age, after she had been entrusted to his care. She described the explorer's tears when they first met, and alleged he had refused to answer her letters. The affair took place five years after Van der Post's second marriage to Ingaret Giffard in 1949, when the girl, Bonnie, travelled to London to become a ballet dancer. Only a few weeks after her arrival in England she went back, pregnant, to South Africa. Jones's research has shown the writer did, however, make financial provision for the baby, arranging to support her until she was 18 by secret deed of covenant. Van der Post was a fantasist who embellished the facts of his life. 'I don't really know why he did it,' said Jones. 'It was mainly on questions of his background. He was a great storyteller in every element of his life. He used to say that he was born 1,001 miles away from the sea, but in fact he was born 325 miles from the sea. Fabrication came naturally to him.' 'The Great White Bushman', as Van der Post came to be known, started out as a journalist in Durban and married his first wife, Marjorie Wendt, in 1928. He travelled between Africa and England before writing his first novel, In A Province, in 1934. During the Second World War he served in Ethiopia, the Western Desert and Burma, before being captured in Java by the Japanese and held for three years. His writings on his captivity were the basis of the film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence . After the war, Van der Post worked with Lord Mountbatten and left the Army as a colonel, with an OBE and a CBE. In the 1950s his literary reputation was secured with the novels The Lost World of the Kalahari and The Heart of the Hunter. He became friends with statesmen, thinkers and business moguls, including Sir James Goldsmith and the founding father of psychotherapy, Carl Gustav Jung. He was asked to become godfather to Prince William. 'It is an extraordinary story,' says Jones. 'He did not have a drop of British blood in his veins and yet he grew up to become an adviser to the heir to the throne and a Prime Minister.' vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk",

Vaz resigned from the company five weeks later, when he became a junior Minister in the Lord Chancellor's department. House of Commons rules state that a MP should register any new directorship within four weeks of taking up the appointment. A spokesman for Vaz last night published letters showing Vaz had been in contact with the parliamentary watchdog and had asked for his directorship to be registered in April. Although Vaz appears not to have broken any parliamentary rules, questions will still be raised over his judgment which is already under intense scrutiny over his friendship with the Hindujas whose quest for a British passport led to the downfall of Peter Mandelson. As a backbench MP, Vaz wrote letters on behalf of the millionaires to Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson. It also emerged last week that since being a Minister he hosted a meeting in the Foreign Office to help a Labour-supporting restaurateur. As well as being caught up in the Elf scandal in France, Auchi's name also surfaced in the infamous 'clean hands' corruption investigations in Italy in 1993 which struck at the heart of the Italian political system. One key player, Tuscan banker Pierfrancesco Pacini Battaglia, told Italian investigators he paid Auchi \u00a316.5 million dollars of commission on an Italo-French bid for a contract to build an oil pipeline for Saddam Hussein in 1986.

While Auchi and his associates say that GMH has no links to the Saddam regime, Iraqi dissidents are not so sure. Opposition groups remain suspicious and are known to have expressed concern to the Foreign Office as long ago as 1995.",

Everyone from Pirelli to Scottish &amp; Southern Energy had to have an e-commerce strategy. </p> <p>Naturally, all believed that the investment would transform their business. British Airways claimed its \u00a3100 million investment in three internet projects would allow it to increase the proportion of its revenue generated on-line from 2 per cent at the start of last year to 50 per cent by 2003. Hilton promised that its \u00a3100 million investment in the web, interactive television and mobile services would give its Ladbroke operation global leadership in the \u00a3520bn global betting market. </p> <p>These days, anyone boasting about the amount they are spending on the internet is greeted with a yawn at best. Companies are privately scal ing back their investment and cancelling projects. The most high-profile climb-downs have been by News Corporation and Disney. At the former Rupert Murdoch has reverted to his original cynicism about the web after some heavy investment by subsidiaries including BSkyB, while Disney is expected to close its Go.com portal. But others, including Emap, Lloyds TSB and Allied Irish Banks (AIB) have been quietly cutting back their commitments to the web. </p> <p>The volte face can be explained easily enough. UK plc was as caught up in the internet mania as the investors, bankers and venture capitalists that backed the dotcom entrepreneurs - those people who, briefly, appeared capable of changing the face of British business. </p> <p>Established companies were both determined to protect their operations from the upstart new entrants and keen to see whether they could get their share of the billions that were apparently being created from the tech nology boom. The upstarts are now looking rather downtrodden and the billions have been shown to be largely illusory. So UK plc has returned to its senses. </p> <p>In banking, for example, ABN Amro calculated that the stand-alone internet banks - including Halifax's If, Abbey National's Cahoot, and Egg - were promising to deliver 2.5 million customers between them. In fact, surveys suggested that only about 1 million customers would actually be interested in using an internet bank. Small wonder that First-e, the first internet-only bank, is cutting back advertising and that LloydsTSB and AIB abandoned plans to set up e-banking companies. </p> <p>Clive Pinder of Metrius, the networked economy practice of accountant KPMG, says the change is being driven by two factors. First, everyone is scaling back their investment budgets, not just technology spend, as economic growth slows, particularly in the US. Second, internet spending was over-hyped. 'In a growth industry, capital expenditure is much more significant in the early stages than it can be going forward.' And he believes the cutbacks are largely affecting the US; Europe, where the hype was more subdued, should not be as badly affected. </p> <p>But some believe the spending spree was little more than hype, anyway. 'We know companies which over-announced their spend just so that their shareholders would think they were doing something,' said Adrian Docherty, a principal with consultant Booz Allen Hamilton. </p> <p>'For example, \u00a3100m buys a lot of programming, and internet technology is not that labour-intensive. Numbers were plucked from the air and the announcements got bigger and bigger.' </p> <p>Not all companies were taken in by the hype. 'Lots of big companies assumed that the rules had not changed,' adds Docherty. </p> <p>'At conferences they are all saying \"thank goodness, we were right all along\". Their inactivity now looks purposeful. That is not true. A lot took so long to get round to thinking about e-commerce that they missed the boat and now they are questioning whether it was the right boat.' </p> <p>Given the low response to some e-commerce activities, it is hard to disagree. Few noticed that Marks &amp; Spencer's online store was closed for four days in the run-up to Christmas: think of the furore that would have been generated had it been one of its high street stores. </p> <p>Some suggest this could be the right time for companies to increase, rather than decrease, their web spending. The plunge in the prices of pure internet companies over the last nine months or so means they will get much more for their money than they did this time last year. Certainly, that seems to be the attitude of companies like Great Universal Stores, which snapped up jungle.com and breathe.com at bargain prices, and Kingfisher, which paid just \u00a315.7m for streets online, the entertainment retailer. </p> <p>But there are not many companies around willing to do that, according to Nick Drewitt of PriceWaterhouseCoopers. 'We are trying to rescue companies before they fail. We have had some successes but it is difficult. It could be because the more established businesses underestimate what it takes to build one of these businesses,' he says. </p> <p>'The challenge is to get people to appreciate the value of what is being created. It is clouded by the mystique of dotcoms. Now the bubble has burst and everyone is against them.' </p> <p>Despite the hype and the backlash, there are examples of companies that have managed to ride the internet boom well. Metrius's Pinder points to Centrica, which owns the Automobile Association and the Goldfish financial services brand. It is trying to maximise the value of all these businesses by cross-marketing them on its web sites. Its success is demonstrated by the fact that Lloyds TSB chose to set up a joint venture with it rather than launch its own internet bank. </p> <p>Others mention Tesco, the leading internet retailer, according to a Datamonitor survey last week, as another likely winner. </p> <p>But Tesco is also a perfect demonstration that big is not necessarily best in internet retailing. Tesco does not have dedicated distribution cen tres but fulfils its orders from local stores. Critics said it would never cope with the demand - and it certainly costs Tesco a lot more to fulfil the orders than its \u00a35 delivery charge. </p> <p>But its internet sales were just \u00a3310m last year, less than from one of its stores, so its existing infrastructure is coping.

But British Steel - now Corus - remains a hierarchical, centrally controlled company with little entrepreneurial flair. </p> <p>It had a \u00a34 billion subsidy by Mrs Thatcher when she privatised it - and a rejigged pension fund that delivers \u00a31bn to Corus each year. Its trade unions are incredibly loyal to the industry. They have accepted annual job reductions and modest pay increases which have allowed the company to increase productivity massively. </p> <p>British Steel got lucky after the great devaluation following our expulsion from the ERM in 1992, and made huge windfall profits on the back of a devalued pound. But the money was frittered away in odd investments in Indonesia and a failure to get into Europe - where, in contrast to a Britain steadily reducing its manufacturing base, steel demand was growing. </p> <p>Those who are praising Sir Brian's tough decision assert that Ministers have no right to tell Corus what to do. Let the politicos get off our back and let us run the company and industry the way we know best, they demand. Yet Corus and other firms are continually pleading for Ministers to change policy in their favour. </p> <p>As a politician I wish industry would get off government's back and stop demanding that every fiscal or social measure be abolished or rendered nugatory. For six years I have represented a steel constituency. I have a filing cabinet full of demands from Corus and other steel compa nies that I ask Ministers to change policy in their favour. </p> <p>The steel and other big manufacturing industries cannot divorce themselves from politics. The euro, environmental policy, infrastructure investment, world trade rules, energy prices and planning decisions all have a major impact on the success or failure of a nation's firms.

Our successful companies know how to talk to government. In Shotton, one of the Corus plants affected by the closure announcement, 1,400 new aerospace jobs have been created following government backing for the industry, helped by a win-win approach from that industry's chiefs. In Rotherham, where Corus announced big job cuts last year, Boeing is investing in a new technology centre. So Labour has to remain a pro-business political party. </p> <p>I will argue for the retention of as many jobs as possible in the South Yorkshire steel industry, but I will argue just as hard for policy that supports new entrepreneurs, new ideas, new investment. </p> <p>But that process can only encouraged if big firms such as Corus enter the public policy arena and debate the priorities in economic policy-making openly. The key issue for Corus is the euro and the 30-year cultural hostility to manufacturing dictated by the London elites that dominate Whitehall and form public opinion. But every suggestion I made to Sir Brian Moffat - as chair of the Steel group of MPs - for open, public discussion on these issues to try and move the policy debate in favour of manufacturing and Europe has been met with a curt dismissal. </p> <p>When the hurt and controversy die down I want to pick up the pieces and make the case for steel and manufacturing. Off-the-shelf answers such as information laws have not, in Europe, prevented mass redundancies on the scale of those announced by Corus. Nor is simply saying yes to the euro the answer, although saying No forever remains the most negative signal the Tory anti-Europeans and the foreign-owned press can transmit. </p> <p>But politicians and business have to talk. I hope Corus is willing to enter that dialogue.

And takeover looms by a monstrous state-controlled gas company whose chairman hates NTV's editorial line. </p> <p>Where lies salvation? In Atlanta, of course, with CNN founder Ted Turner. </p> <p>Well, maybe. For even if Turner buys into NTV, he'll only get 25 per cent plus one share - and no promise of political non-interference, which he sought from president Vladimir Putin. Turner was last week pondering a letter from Putin welcoming his interest in NTV, but declining to give guarantees, and an offer of support from billionaire investor George Soros for a bid aimed at preserving NTV's independence. </p> <p>Meanwhile Russian tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, whose Media Most holding company is NTV's largest shareholder, was in court in Madrid on Wednesday, fighting extradition to Russia on money-laundering charges he maintains are politically motivated. </p> <p>Gusinsky's fall from grace since Putin's election as president last year is the root of NTV's misfortunes. Under Boris Yeltsin, Gusinsky, a banker, former theatre director and chairman of the Russian Jewish Congress, picked up the pieces of the old Soviet broadcasting network to make NTV one of two stations to broadcast across Russia. The other, ORT, is owned 51 per cent by the state and 49 per cent by car-sales-to-oil magnate Boris Berezovsky, reputedly Russia's richest man. </p> <p>In 1996 no one could have been closer to the Kremlin than Berezovsky and Gusinsky. When Yeltsin looked as if he would lose the presidential election to Communist Party candidate Gennady Zyuga-nov, Berezovsky rallied his fellow oligarchs. ORT and NTV churned out crude anti-Zyuganov propaganda and Yeltsin was re-elected. </p> <p>The other oligarchs went back to amassing fortunes, mainly by taking control of cash flows from oil, gas and metals exports and siphoning them abroad. But Gusinsky struggled. Media Most became Russia's largest media group, embracing Ekho Moskvy radio station, Segodnya newspaper and several magazines - but accumulated $800 million of debt, more than half owed to Credit Suisse First Boston bank (CSFB), the rest to Russian banks and the Moscow city council. </p> <p>Then Gusinsky fell out with the clique that runs the Kremlin. They clashed in a struggle over a stake in the state phone company, Svyazinvest. Then NTV journalists started highlighting corruption among Kremlin officials and criticising Russia's renewed assault on Chechnya. In June 1999 Aleksandr Voloshin, head of the presidential administration, asked Gusinsky to support Yeltsin's favoured successor, Putin, in the March 2000 presidential election. The tycoon declined. </p> <p>Gusinsky found himself out in the cold. Gun-toting tax police raided Media Most's offices and fraud charges were brought. He was jailed for three days in Moscow last summer, and for 13 days in Spain just before Christmas. </p> <p>Two weeks ago public prosecutor Vladimir Ustinov, reportedly enraged by NTV journalists' investigations into the business affairs of his deputy's daughter, widened the attack. Media Most's chief financial officer, Anton Titov, was charged with embezzlement. Senior NTV staff were questioned about zero-interest loans. </p> <p>Gusinsky is also under fire from state-controlled gas producer Gazprom, Russia's largest company by far and owner of one-fifth of the world's natural gas reserves. Gazprom guaranteed Media Most's loans from CSFB and is taking legal action to recover the largest one, $262m. It owns 46 per cent of NTV and holds a further 19 per cent as collateral for the CSFB loan. </p> <p>Gazprom officials went on the offensive last week, calling for an emergency NTV shareholders' meeting. Gazprom would use the meeting to take control of NTV from Gusinsky, said the tycoon's old enemy, Alfred Kokh, a former privatisation minister in charge of Gazprom's dealings with Media Most. </p> <p>Gazprom's multi-millionaire chairman, Rem Vya-khirev, who last year denounced NTV's Chechnya coverage, played TV critic again last week, denouncing as 'shameful' NTV reports of the energy crisis in the Russian 'far east' - where widespread power cuts and heating failures in sub-zero temperatures mean people are freezing to death. </p> <p>NTV staff say the two-pronged assault by Gazprom and the public prosecutor could only be mounted from one place: the Kremlin. News presenter Svetlana Sorokina appealed to president Putin on air to meet station journalists. On Monday he did. </p> <p>Putin said he enjoyed the political programming, and even Kukli (Puppets), a Spitting Image-style satire whose Putin puppet had reportedly distressed him. He reasserted his belief in press freedom and denied orchestrating an attack. </p> <p>Grigory Krichevsky, NTV's head of news, told the The Observer: 'The trouble is that there is a difference between what Putin says and what those around him do. The chairman of Gazprom is [Dmitry Medvedev] deputy head of the Kremlin administration. It's obvious that Gazprom's actions are approved in the Kremlin. </p> <p>'At the meeting, I asked Putin about this straight out. He said that he, and everyone in Russia, needs NTV to be independent. But there are those in the Kremlin who don't like what NTV is saying about Russia's real problems, about what's really happening in Chechnya, about the energy crisis in the far east, about corruption.' </p> <p>Krichevsky says that if Gazprom wins control of NTV, it would probably end up with 'interests close to Kokh or to [press minister Mikhail] Lesin' - and lose much of its independence. </p> <p>Turner, allegedly bored and under-exerted in his capacity as vice-president of AOL Time Warner, is perhaps NTV's best hope. But he got burned in the early 1990s when he tried to buy into another Russian TV station, TV-6, and is reputedly hesitant about wading into the swamp of Moscow politics. Soros, who was never shy in that respect, told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos that he would support a Turner bid for the sake of press freedom. </p> <p>And Putin is on the spot. TV is the main source of news for most Russians. If Gazprom swallows NTV, most of them are likely to end up without non-state national TV. </p> <p>The situation is exacerbated by the failure last year of an attempt to distance ORT's editorial line from the Kremlin by establishing a governing council of journalists and public figures. </p> <p>The plan went sour as its author, Berezovsky, clashed with the Kremlin and, like Gusinsky, left Russia. </p> <p>Tom Adshead, political analyst at Troika Dialog investment bank, said Putin's aim is not so much to destroy NTV's independence as to punish Gusinsky. 'He offered a deal to the oligarchs, that if they kept out of politics, he would leave them free to go ahead and make money. All except Gusinsky and Berezovsky were happy to oblige.' </p> <p>But NTV's Krichevsky says Putin can not stay neutral. 'If Turner comes in, the station will be more independent.

      "body": "<p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name: </strong> Julian Metcalfe </p> <p><strong> Job title: </strong> Co-founder and chairman of Pret A Manger </p> <p><strong> Age:</strong> 41 </p> <p><strong> Other directorships: </strong> Two restaurants called Itsu </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Family, sailing, diving </p> <p>Littering the walls of Pret A Manger's HQ, a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace, are hundreds of mostly hand-written letters. </p> <p>Many are from customers enthusing about a particular Pret sandwich. Others sing the praises of Pret's perennially sunny staff. A few applaud the company's ability to deal with complaints - most of which seem to concern soy sauce spillages from Pret's sushi range - 'quickly and courteously'. Rather alarmingly, there is the odd poem, too. </p> <p>And yet Julian Metcalfe, the chairman and co-founder of the sandwich chain, is a worried man, acutely concerned about the prospect of losing his customers. </p> <p>An ever-present threat for any owner perhaps, but Metcalfe has a greater cause for concern than he did this time last week. The Pret chain, which has built up a tremendously loyal following thanks to its reputation for producing thoughtfully made deli-style food using natural ingredients, last week signed up to the most Faustian of Faustian pacts. </p> <p>After months of speculation, McDonald's, which with a turnover of $40 billion across 120 countries and 2 million staff has become synonymous with business excess, has swallowed a third share of Pret. The deal values the company at around \u00a380 m. </p> <p>Purists fear the move threatens the very existence of the great British sandwich. Newspapers have devoted many anguished column inches bemoaning the potential loss of our one great gift to gastronomy. What the Queen, one of Pret's biggest customers - Buck house staff loving its deli wraps for their lunches - thinks of the matter is anyone's guess. </p> <p>Metcalfe plays the humble card. 'There's nothing I can add except that I'm going to earn back my customers' respect. I'm not worried about my staff because they trust me, but it's going to take time to earn the trust of my customers and some of them will take this the wrong way. It's sad but I will have to win their respect again and I will.' </p> <p>Metcalfe says the McDonald's deal was the only one he ever considered doing. A full sell-out was never on the cards. 'It's to help Pret become a global brand, operating in as many countries as we can. It will lay foundations that will allow the company to continue long after I'm dead. It was never a question of selling or even parting with a controlling stake. I'm not stupid. A 33 per cent stake does not give them the right to tell us what we do.' </p> <p>But why not float the company and use the capital to fund expansion abroad? 'What's the point? It wouldn't help us in Spain or Tokyo. It just gives us money and what we really need is expertise. It was either this or accept the fact that we'd stay a UK company. But I've always wanted to build Pret abroad.' </p> <p>The chain, which has 104 outlets in the UK, opened its first overseas branch in New York last year. But that was only after two years of frenetic activity on the part of Pret's co-founder, Sinclair Beecham. The experience left both men bewildered and frustrated. Hence Metcalfe's relief that Ronald McDonald fancied a bite of his company. </p> <p>'It's the biggest hurdle over. You have no idea what a worry it was. I spent 18 months in Holland trying to open shops and I would come back on the plane thinking, How are we going to do this? I have no one to talk to. It would take a lifetime.' </p> <p>But McDonald's? </p> <p>Metcalfe bristles at the suggestion he is selling out, emphasising that there were other potentially lucrative avenues Pret could have explored if it was really after the money. 'Over the last five years we've had hundreds and hundreds of offers. If we were in it for the money, we would have done it many many times over. But if you put a Pret sandwich on an airplane flying to Athens and back it's not right. The taste has gone. Don't do it for the extra buck. It stopped being about money years ago.' </p> <p>Such a statement seems at odds with McDonald's ambitions, namely maximising profits for its shareholders. But Metcalfe is adamant he will control the pace. The company will open only 20 stores in the UK and seven in Manhattan this year, hardly a dramatic growth spurt. And he plans only a further 35 openings next year. </p> <p>Pret's expansion programme has been remarkably constrained given the seemingly voracious appetite the UK public has for its food: customers graze on \u00a3100m of Pret products a year. </p> <p>Founded in 1986 with a \u00a317,500 loan, Pret opened its first store near Victoria station. Beecham and Metcalfe, who met as students at the Central London polytechnic, had originally tried their hand running a chain of off-licences, but the idea flopped. 'I couldn't get worked up about it. I couldn't put my heart and soul into it.' </p> <p>Now, of course, Metcalfe can be as passionate as he likes. He's especially exercised about building new sandwiches. 'There are many components to a good sandwich. Not only do you have to find the right supplier to get the right ingredient, you have to get the recipe right. It looks easy but it's not. A typical sandwich could take a month to develop. You will try different sauces, different scoop sizes, it will go back and forth to the suppliers, then it goes to test shops for a few weeks. You have to find out does it work? Does it go soggy?' </p> <p>Above Metcalfe's small office is a test kitchen where he and several colleagues retire each Thursday to test new products. Currently he's excited about several prototypes. Soup trials in one select store have been going very well and a number of new sarnies look likely to cut the mustard. 'There's a couple of interesting ones in the pipeline. We've developed a really good chutney made with fresh pineapple and when you put it with gammon it's bloody great. The good thing is it's not too expensive. It was a Nigella Lawson recipe. You can buy this great sandwich for \u00a32.20 and it's fit for a king.' </p> <p>Metcalfe will find out whether the chutney is a winner at his next 'buddy day'. Five days a year, Pret's managers work in their 'buddy' outlets to get a feel for the business from behind the counter. 'You interact with them. You hear all their niggles and find out what they hate. My buddy store's in Notting Hill. Our bin has got problems. It doesn't work properly, so that's what I'm sorting out right now. It's great to be able to work with the guys there and develop things at the micro level. That's what it's all about.' </p> <p>Metcalfe also mixes with employees a couple of times a year when Pret throws a huge party for its 2,200 staff. Emphasis on staff is obviously a priority for the company and Metcalfe is proud that nearly two-thirds of managerial appointments come from within the chain. 'I think the real enemy is within the four walls of Pret. Are we ever going to become complacent? </p> <p>' If we get bigger do we lose our values? We must be very very sensitive to the people who work with us. If people are proud of what they do, they'll treat customers properly.' </p> <p>Metcalfe's fear of complacency means he's permanently tinkering with Pret's offerings. He once diagnosed himself with an attention-deficit disorder, which would cause him to do things like put the phone down in the middle of important conversations that he found boring. 'I like to change things. I'm never really satisfied. No sooner have I completed something, it's not right.' </p> <p>Still, Metcalfe knows his mind when it comes to food. 'I know when something's special and delicious. I know when it's mediocre. I remember when we developed kedgeree. We found a supplier who provided really good undyed smoked haddock and we put it with coronation sauce and it was great. It was such a fun day.' The deal with McDonald's, he hopes, will ensure plenty more fun days. But it is a challenge. </p> <p>Pret now finds itself wedged between McDonald's shareholders and its 'bohemian leanings'. </p> <p>Sandwiched, in fact.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tears in the valleys, cheers in the City. While workers in Wales and the North-east were last week coming to terms with the personal cost of steelmaker Corus's savage 6,050 job cuts, traders in the City merrily marked up the shares nearly 10 per cent. </p> <p>In Ebbw Vale, where Corus's tin-plate and rolling mills are to close, with 780 jobs lost, the gloom is deep. Here is Wales's most depressed area - male unemployment the highest in the region at 11.1 per cent, GCSE passes 10 per cent below the Welsh average, weekly wages \u00a342 lower, and the highest level of coronary heart disease. Now its only source of employment will close. </p> <p>In Westminster and Cardiff the hammer blow from Corus's chairman Sir Brian Moffat provoked venom from Ministers, who have become only too used to being knocked about by manufacturers.'Moffat has treated us contemptuously,' said one ministerial aide. 'He came to meetings. He was polite, but he told us nothing. And all this stuff they've said about not trusting us with price-sensitive information is simply rubbish.' </p> <p>The bile is partly tactics - by inflating their outrage Ministers emphasise Corus is at fault. As one said: 'This was not like Rover, where there was nothing written in the papers in the weeks before. We all knew [this] was going to happen, but they still would not help us. That's not how a company like this should behave.' </p> <p>But had the Government - or trade unions, for that matter - been told which plant and which jobs were being cut, could they have done anything? No, say most analysts. Thursday's cutbacks were the end of a rocky road for Corus's UK operations that started in 1996, when it was still known as British Steel. </p> <p>That year the company made pre-tax profits of \u00a31 billion - a fact picked up by incredulous Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan, who demanded to know why cash was spent on a \u00a3800 million special dividend in 1999 to shareholders rather than on investment in the company to protect jobs. Analysts were quick to point out that Corus's balance sheet was not the real difficulty. It was the \u00a3350m loss last year in the UK. </p> <p>Problem one was the reversal in the economic conditions that underpinned the 1996 performance. Steel is a cyclical industrial commodity. In 1995, prices for hot rolled coil - the basic material - stood at DM700 (\u00a3233) a tonne (German prices were the benchmark). Since then they have juddered mainly down, thanks to world overcapacity. In November last year, as Corus executives realised a radical restructuring was required, they stood at the equivalent of DM550. </p> <p>According to Jeremy Fletcher, steel analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, every DM3 fall in price knocked \u00a315m off British Steel's profits. The problem is worse for Corus, which was formed by the merger of British Steel and Dutch Hoogovens. With more production, every DM3 fall knocks off \u00a320m. </p> <p>Alongside this has been the strength of the pound against European currencies, which hammers Corus's overseas competitiveness. In mid 1996, the pound stood at around DM2.20. It has since soared to a peak of DM3.40. On Friday it stood at the equivalent of DM3.07. </p> <p>The other key factor is that demand from UK manufacturers fell by 13 per cent between 1988 and 2000, while in the rest of EU it rose by 23 per cent. Corus had to respond by exporting more. In 1990, it sent 28 per cent of production overseas, by 2000 it was 43 per cent, exposing it to the vagaries of the exchange rate. </p> <p>Meanwhile, says Fletcher, those UK manufacturers who wanted steel wanted higher-value product that would have been better sold overseas, where they could have held their value. The result was dire: low-value commodity 'flat' steel being exported. </p> <p>UK steelmaking has also been hit by low-cost imports, particularly from Russia and Asia. The Iron and Steel Statistics Bureau shows that in 1970 the UK's 19 million tonne market for steel products was met with 18 million from the UK and 1 million overseas; 2000 saw the UK exporting 7.3 million tonnes and importing 6.6 million tonnes. </p> <p>Some in the City clearly believe that the restructuring process has grappled successfully with these problems. Corus has cut steelmaking capacity by closing Llanwern's blast furnaces, along with flat mills at Shotton and Ebbw Vale. Corus's flat production falls by 2.7 million tonnes - almost exactly what it exports to Europe, leaving its more marketable long products division, producing rails and beams, more intact. </p> <p>Fletcher points out that with a modest upturn in the world steel price in the second half of the year, along with other savings, the company will be strongly back in profit by 2002. </p> <p>So much for problem one. The gravity of the situation has been made worse by problem two - the pig's ear that the company has made of managing this situation. </p> <p>This part of the story goes back to the 1999 merger. British Steel and Hoogovens joining forces followed a round of consolidation among German, Belgian, French and Spanish steelmakers, all responding to the dismal global outlook. This is where Rhodri Morgan's \u00a3800m went. To make the merger work, British Steel paid the money back to its shareholders. Analysts and The Observer predicted at the time that thousands of jobs would have to go. </p> <p>Then came the botching. Two chief executives, British Steel's John Bryant and Hoogovens' Fokko Van Duyne were appointed joint chief executives. </p> <p>Last year they announced 4,500 redundancies across the company. Unions were outraged because it appeared that some of these would have to be compulsory - a course never taken by British Steel. </p> <p>But then it got worse. The economic outlook worsened as sterling gained strength and steel prices weakened. The City was unimpressed - the cuts were seen as insufficient, and the share price dropped. </p> <p>According to people close to the company, Corus panicked.

      "bodyText": "Tears in the valleys, cheers in the City. While workers in Wales and the North-east were last week coming to terms with the personal cost of steelmaker Corus's savage 6,050 job cuts, traders in the City merrily marked up the shares nearly 10 per cent. In Ebbw Vale, where Corus's tin-plate and rolling mills are to close, with 780 jobs lost, the gloom is deep. Here is Wales's most depressed area - male unemployment the highest in the region at 11.1 per cent, GCSE passes 10 per cent below the Welsh average, weekly wages \u00a342 lower, and the highest level of coronary heart disease. Now its only source of employment will close. In Westminster and Cardiff the hammer blow from Corus's chairman Sir Brian Moffat provoked venom from Ministers, who have become only too used to being knocked about by manufacturers.'Moffat has treated us contemptuously,' said one ministerial aide. 'He came to meetings. He was polite, but he told us nothing. And all this stuff they've said about not trusting us with price-sensitive information is simply rubbish.' The bile is partly tactics - by inflating their outrage Ministers emphasise Corus is at fault. As one said: 'This was not like Rover, where there was nothing written in the papers in the weeks before. We all knew [this] was going to happen, but they still would not help us. That's not how a company like this should behave.' But had the Government - or trade unions, for that matter - been told which plant and which jobs were being cut, could they have done anything? No, say most analysts. Thursday's cutbacks were the end of a rocky road for Corus's UK operations that started in 1996, when it was still known as British Steel. That year the company made pre-tax profits of \u00a31 billion - a fact picked up by incredulous Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan, who demanded to know why cash was spent on a \u00a3800 million special dividend in 1999 to shareholders rather than on investment in the company to protect jobs. Analysts were quick to point out that Corus's balance sheet was not the real difficulty. It was the \u00a3350m loss last year in the UK. Problem one was the reversal in the economic conditions that underpinned the 1996 performance. Steel is a cyclical industrial commodity. In 1995, prices for hot rolled coil - the basic material - stood at DM700 (\u00a3233) a tonne (German prices were the benchmark). Since then they have juddered mainly down, thanks to world overcapacity. In November last year, as Corus executives realised a radical restructuring was required, they stood at the equivalent of DM550. According to Jeremy Fletcher, steel analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, every DM3 fall in price knocked \u00a315m off British Steel's profits. The problem is worse for Corus, which was formed by the merger of British Steel and Dutch Hoogovens. With more production, every DM3 fall knocks off \u00a320m. Alongside this has been the strength of the pound against European currencies, which hammers Corus's overseas competitiveness. In mid 1996, the pound stood at around DM2.20. It has since soared to a peak of DM3.40. On Friday it stood at the equivalent of DM3.07. The other key factor is that demand from UK manufacturers fell by 13 per cent between 1988 and 2000, while in the rest of EU it rose by 23 per cent. Corus had to respond by exporting more. In 1990, it sent 28 per cent of production overseas, by 2000 it was 43 per cent, exposing it to the vagaries of the exchange rate. Meanwhile, says Fletcher, those UK manufacturers who wanted steel wanted higher-value product that would have been better sold overseas, where they could have held their value. The result was dire: low-value commodity 'flat' steel being exported. UK steelmaking has also been hit by low-cost imports, particularly from Russia and Asia. The Iron and Steel Statistics Bureau shows that in 1970 the UK's 19 million tonne market for steel products was met with 18 million from the UK and 1 million overseas; 2000 saw the UK exporting 7.3 million tonnes and importing 6.6 million tonnes. Some in the City clearly believe that the restructuring process has grappled successfully with these problems. Corus has cut steelmaking capacity by closing Llanwern's blast furnaces, along with flat mills at Shotton and Ebbw Vale. Corus's flat production falls by 2.7 million tonnes - almost exactly what it exports to Europe, leaving its more marketable long products division, producing rails and beams, more intact. Fletcher points out that with a modest upturn in the world steel price in the second half of the year, along with other savings, the company will be strongly back in profit by 2002. So much for problem one. The gravity of the situation has been made worse by problem two - the pig's ear that the company has made of managing this situation. This part of the story goes back to the 1999 merger. British Steel and Hoogovens joining forces followed a round of consolidation among German, Belgian, French and Spanish steelmakers, all responding to the dismal global outlook. This is where Rhodri Morgan's \u00a3800m went. To make the merger work, British Steel paid the money back to its shareholders. Analysts and The Observer predicted at the time that thousands of jobs would have to go. Then came the botching. Two chief executives, British Steel's John Bryant and Hoogovens' Fokko Van Duyne were appointed joint chief executives. Last year they announced 4,500 redundancies across the company. Unions were outraged because it appeared that some of these would have to be compulsory - a course never taken by British Steel. But then it got worse. The economic outlook worsened as sterling gained strength and steel prices weakened. The City was unimpressed - the cuts were seen as insufficient, and the share price dropped. According to people close to the company, Corus panicked. One said: 'You had two chief executives, which was confusing for a start. Van Duyne was used to running Hoogovens, which is a small company, and was not used to the glare of the FTSE, and he was used to European boards, where chief executives are less powerful. 'You had these two guys going into the board and presenting different schemes - shut down Teesside, close Llanwern, cut across the group. There were three very difficult boards from July onwards, where the non-executives said, look these are your responsibilities. By November Moffatt said \"enough\".' The rest is history. In December Van Duyne and Bryant left. Moffat took over, promising radical cutbacks. It was bad news all round. Moffat, a dour Scottish accountant who made his name by axeing jobs at Port Talbot in the 1980s, slammed down the shutters. As one union member said: 'They did not consult us. The first our members heard about it was on the radio. It was disgraceful.' The Government shared the view. One official said: 'At least the previous management listened.

'We asked them if there was anything we could do. Was the climate change levy a factor? Could we put a package together for research and development? Could anything be done on reducing their business rates? Could they manage their energy bills better? It's not the way to do things.' Hopes now rest on negotiations between the Government, unions and Corus to save some parts of the company. But hopes are slim.

      "bodyText": "Bank of Scotland is threatening to pull out of merger talks with Abbey National unless a rival \u00a320 billion bid from Lloyds TSB is referred to the Competition Commission. The warning comes as the Office of Fair Trading has delivered its recommendations on the \u00a327bn BoS bid to Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary. Byers now has until Thursday to make his views known, and is expected to clear the Scottish deal. A decision on Lloyds TSB's bid is due by 23 February, and the market is betting on a referral. Lloyds TSB would close and relocate more than 600 of Abbey's 722 branches, with 9,000 job losses and savings of \u00a3950 million a year. The plan has caused uproar among MPs and unions. BoS's plan is about growth, not closures, but it has now effectively shelved the deal pending Byers' decision on the rival scheme. This weekend Scotland's number two bank also ruled out a straight fight with Lloyds TSB. 'We are not getting into a bidding war for Abbey. Lloyds TSB has much deeper pockets,' one senior BoS source said. 'If we are cleared and Lloyds is cleared, we will walk away.' BoS is set to resist any pressure from the Takeover Panel, the City's bid watchdog, to unveil details of its merger with Abbey following Byers' decisionthis week. If Lloyds TSB is referred, how ever, insiders say it will go public and give shareholders a straight choice. Lloyds' offer of cash and shares is conditional on the Abbey board recommending it to shareholders. Yet the former building society has already rejected it. Its chief executive, Ian Harley, and his Lloyds TSB counterpart Peter Ellwood are set to discuss the bid this week. 'We are looking for a bit more clarity from Lloyds and what their strategy is for the combined group,' Harley said.",

      "bodyText": "In a tough Welsh valleys town like Ebbw Vale, tales of redundancy and disaster stretch far back into time. Now Tyron Williams, like his father and grandfather before him, can add his own generation's tragic story. It will be the last. After 29 years of toil Williams, 46, has been laid off from the town's steel plant, which is to close, killing an industry that has been there for 220 years. It happened to his grandfather Jimmy, who was laid off in 1969 in the last major round of closures. His father Billy ended his working life after his hands were crushed in an accident at the local mine which fed coal to the hungry steel furnaces. The pit shut in 1991. 'My family has seen the whole history of this place. But that's it now. I can't see much of a future for this town,' Williams said. But Williams is one of the fortunate few. Through the generosity of his brother-in-law, a job awaits him 20 miles away in Cardiff, though it won't bring the same pay - or pride - as a place in the 'works'. Fewer than 100 yards from Williams's terraced home, live three more steel men. Each has a family, and each is now without a job. Bryn Hawkins, married with two children, worked for 28 years at the steel plant. At 46, finding a new job will be almost impossible, and his company pension will be frozen until he is 65. He faces up to 19 years on the dole. 'I just wanted my pension,' Hawkins said. 'I could have claimed it at 50 if the plant had stayed open. I am devastated.' Two doors away Colin Hazlewood, 48, is equally upset. He said: 'I don't know what I'm going to do. It has not sunk in yet.' The three men met as children and joined the steel plant from school.

A survey by the charity Daycare Trust, due to be published tomorrow, has found that working parents are spending more on childcare for one pre school-age offspring alone than the average family of four spends on food or housing. The national average for a full-time nursery place for a two-year-old now costs more than \u00a3110 a week - but a postcode lottery means the price can lurch from the \u00a3200 a week paid by a mother in inner London to \u00a390.62 paid by parents in the North East.

That costs \u00a34,500 a year. A nanny costs a total of \u00a314,900 - \u00a311,940 wages including tax, \u00a32,000 in expenses, and \u00a3960 employer's national insurance. Parents already guilt-stricken about leaving their child don't need the added burden of being unable to afford the best, said childcare guru Dr Penelope Leach. She is conducting a comprehensive seven year study into the effect of modern childcare on families. 'I hate the idea that the cost of childcare may be a real issue in people's decision how many children they have. Society ought not to allow that,' she said. 'But it would be very foolish to jump to the conclusion that we have a generation of children who will be somehow damaged by being brought up by someone else. It's important that we remember that at no point in history have children all been brought up in the 24-hour care of a parent. The only difference today is that childcare is so varied,' she said. 'Continuity of care is crucial and I have a hunch that the best childcare, whether a nanny, nursery or childminder, is when the parents are able to practically achieve the type of childcare they would ideally have if money were not involved.' tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>There is a banner above a tower block entrance in Chanteloup-les-Vignes in suburban Paris: 'It's your estate, it's your pride. Your honour. It's up to us to defend it.'</p> <p>'That sign tells the truth,' said Sofiane, 16. 'That's what we did when we had the rumble - we defended our honour. We showed our pride against those scumbags from Val-Fourre.'</p> <p>Sofiane was one of nearly 100 young men from the estate who took the 14.20 train last Saturday from Chanteloup to La D\u00e9fense in Paris, from their dilapidated suburb to a sleek, high-rise development housing one of the largest shopping centres in Europe. Armed with baseball bats, knives, hammers and axes, they had arranged to meet a gang called the Grags from the Val-Fourre estate in Mantes-la-Jolie, not far from Chanteloup, to settle their differences.</p> <p>The 200-strong Grags had arrived early, and were already making a nuisance of themselves at La D\u00e9fense's shopping centre, threatening families and brandishing their weapons in preparation for the coming brawl, when Sofiane and his comrades arrived. After two hours of fighting which embroiled 200 police and a battalion of the CRS riot squad, 10 gang members were injured and nearly 30 arrested. And a wave of alarm about growing violence among disenchanted youth was spreading across France.</p> <p>'It was great,' recalled Sofiane, leaning against a car as a bleak dusk fell on Chanteloup last week. 'Not just the fighting, but we completely wrong-footed the police. We just called the Grags up on mobiles to fix a time and a neutral place, and the police didn't seem to know and so they didn't have enough people to deal with us.'</p> <p>Sofiane and three of his friends, all clad in Lacoste clothes, were happy enough to recount the most glorious moments of their short lives. The only problem was understanding them since they spoke in a suburban Paris argot called Verlan. In Verlan, Paris becomes Ripas, honte (shame) becomes tehon , mec (guy) keum , chaud (hot) auch, and taper (to hit) peta . Ironically, all the gang members of suburban Paris, whatever their differences, speak fluent Verlan.</p> <p>Only one of Sofiane's friends isn't happy about the press turning up. 'If the battle had taken place in Chante-loup-les-Vignes, you wouldn't be here. Everybody - press, TV, intellectuals - only get interested in our problems when the white bourgeois are embroiled. If it's just a matter of us kids stabbing each other, it's not even news. But when we get into a brawl where all the nice families are shopping, suddenly it's international news.'</p> <p>He has a point. There would be no reason for any outsiders to visit Chanteloup-les-Vignes had it not been for the brawl at La D\u00e9fense. It's as interesting as Tottenham would be without the football team - some fairly drab housing, ugly high-rise flats, a few seedy shops and gangs of kids hanging around stairwells.</p> <p>On top of the hill is Chanteloup proper, where nice families live in nice villas and commute to Paris. Down in the valley is Chanteloup-les-Vignes, most of it built in the 1970s to house car workers at the Simca factory.</p> <p>Its toughest estate is called La Cit\u00e9 de la Noe. Today 63 per cent of the 10,000 people who live here are under 26, a large proportion from \u00d1orth or sub-Saharan Africa. It's very much like 20 or so other estates beyond the Paris ring road where much of France's 11 million members of ethnic minorities live, where school attendance figures are laughable, where respect for law and order is negligible, and drugs and violence feared to be endemic.</p> <p>While central Paris basks in its gilded glories, the toughest suburbs produce kids who fight among themselves.

      "bodyText": "There is a banner above a tower block entrance in Chanteloup-les-Vignes in suburban Paris: 'It's your estate, it's your pride. Your honour. It's up to us to defend it.' 'That sign tells the truth,' said Sofiane, 16. 'That's what we did when we had the rumble - we defended our honour. We showed our pride against those scumbags from Val-Fourre.' Sofiane was one of nearly 100 young men from the estate who took the 14.20 train last Saturday from Chanteloup to La D\u00e9fense in Paris, from their dilapidated suburb to a sleek, high-rise development housing one of the largest shopping centres in Europe. Armed with baseball bats, knives, hammers and axes, they had arranged to meet a gang called the Grags from the Val-Fourre estate in Mantes-la-Jolie, not far from Chanteloup, to settle their differences. The 200-strong Grags had arrived early, and were already making a nuisance of themselves at La D\u00e9fense's shopping centre, threatening families and brandishing their weapons in preparation for the coming brawl, when Sofiane and his comrades arrived. After two hours of fighting which embroiled 200 police and a battalion of the CRS riot squad, 10 gang members were injured and nearly 30 arrested. And a wave of alarm about growing violence among disenchanted youth was spreading across France. 'It was great,' recalled Sofiane, leaning against a car as a bleak dusk fell on Chanteloup last week. 'Not just the fighting, but we completely wrong-footed the police. We just called the Grags up on mobiles to fix a time and a neutral place, and the police didn't seem to know and so they didn't have enough people to deal with us.' Sofiane and three of his friends, all clad in Lacoste clothes, were happy enough to recount the most glorious moments of their short lives. The only problem was understanding them since they spoke in a suburban Paris argot called Verlan. In Verlan, Paris becomes Ripas, honte (shame) becomes tehon , mec (guy) keum , chaud (hot) auch, and taper (to hit) peta . Ironically, all the gang members of suburban Paris, whatever their differences, speak fluent Verlan. Only one of Sofiane's friends isn't happy about the press turning up. 'If the battle had taken place in Chante-loup-les-Vignes, you wouldn't be here. Everybody - press, TV, intellectuals - only get interested in our problems when the white bourgeois are embroiled. If it's just a matter of us kids stabbing each other, it's not even news. But when we get into a brawl where all the nice families are shopping, suddenly it's international news.' He has a point. There would be no reason for any outsiders to visit Chanteloup-les-Vignes had it not been for the brawl at La D\u00e9fense. It's as interesting as Tottenham would be without the football team - some fairly drab housing, ugly high-rise flats, a few seedy shops and gangs of kids hanging around stairwells. On top of the hill is Chanteloup proper, where nice families live in nice villas and commute to Paris. Down in the valley is Chanteloup-les-Vignes, most of it built in the 1970s to house car workers at the Simca factory. Its toughest estate is called La Cit\u00e9 de la Noe. Today 63 per cent of the 10,000 people who live here are under 26, a large proportion from \u00d1orth or sub-Saharan Africa. It's very much like 20 or so other estates beyond the Paris ring road where much of France's 11 million members of ethnic minorities live, where school attendance figures are laughable, where respect for law and order is negligible, and drugs and violence feared to be endemic. While central Paris basks in its gilded glories, the toughest suburbs produce kids who fight among themselves. It's hard for outsiders to tell them apart: they wear the same clothes, speak the same argot, and share a hatred for the police. At Mantes-la-Jolie the word 'Sniper' is tagged on the wall of a tower block, commemorating a gang member who was jailed for 14 years in 1995 for shooting a policeman in the head. In La Cit\u00e9 de la Noe they call the police'Schmitt', though they can't remember why. On Wednesday night at nearby Poissy, police who tried to question some teenagers were pelted with stones. Strange, with so much in common, that the gangs direct the violence almost exclusively at each other.

It started more than a year ago, on a cold and wet December morning, deep in Surrey. That was when I joined lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service, prosecution barristers and police to walk round the sodden, desolate places where, 15 years ago, three young women had been raped, gagged, bound and then strangled to death.</p> <p>The CPS had allowed me to film its work for a Channel 4 documentary. We wanted to follow the CPS as it prosecuted a high-profile murder case. That is how I came to witness Regina v David Mulcahy from behind the scenes.</p> <p>Mulcahy had been arrested as a suspect in the original 1986 police inquiry into the railway rapes, but released through lack of evidence. Now the police had a crucial new witness. In 1988, a man called John Duffy was found guilty of some of the railway rapes and murders and was sentenced to life.</p> <p>But for police the case had never been completely closed. They had Duffy behind bars but they were haunted by the knowledge that the rape victims who survived spoke of two men who attacked them. And then, two years ago, John Duffy began to talk.</p> <p>From his prison cell he began to make a remarkable confession, admitting to the crimes for which he was found guilty in 1988 as well as confessing to more unsolved sex crimes. But he went even further. He named his accomplice on some of those rapes and all of the murders as his former best friend, David Mulcahy. It was for 15 counts of sexual violence - three were rape and murder, the rest rape and conspiracy to rape - all committed between 1982 and 1986, that David Mulcahy eventually stood trial.</p> <p>The crucial question for the prosecution team was how the jury would view Duffy. He was a convicted rapist and murderer who, until recently, had denied he had anything to do with the railway rapes. Why was he talking now? Was he trying to put some of the blame on someone else in the hope of getting an early release? It was with this in mind that we set off that winter's morning to visit the scene in East Horsley, Surrey, where in April 1986, Maartje Tamboezer, 15, was raped and murdered. Police led us through Duffy's horrifying account of how he and Mulcahy first spotted their victim, grabbed her from her bike and subjected her to a long and terrifying walk through fields. According to Duffy, he then raped her alone before handing her back to Mulcahy, who hit her across the face with a stone, put a belt around her neck and told Duffy to strangle her.</p> <p>The East Horsley visit made one significant contribution to the prosecution case: it was clear from visiting the scene of Tamboezer's murder that Duffy could not have carried out the attack alone.</p> <p>The distance covered, the disposal of the bike, the fact that no one had heard screaming or seen signs of a struggle, all pointed to the fact that two men must have overpowered the girl. Duffy had confessed to being one of the men. But was Mulcahy the second man?</p> <p>The prosecution could not rely on the evidence of a rapist and murderer. It had to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mulcahy had been the second man. The defence, of course, would try to knock holes in that case. And unlike the prosecution, which has to prove its case, the defence merely has to introduce doubt in order to win.</p> <p>We then visited the scene of the murder of Alison Day, killed in December 1985 near Hackney Wick BR station in north-east London. According to Duffy, the attack involved taking the victim on a walk along railway tracks and canal paths and under a bridge where the two men raped her. At one point, Mulcahy made her walk, at knifepoint, along a thin ledge on the outside of the bridge crossing the canal. According to Duffy, Alison fell into the canal, was pulled out, raped by Mulcahy again and then strangled by him.</p> <p>As the prosecution team examined the ledge of the bridge along which Alison Day was forced to walk, Andy Murphy, head of the police inquiry, said: 'You can see the violence increasing with the rapes. Mulcahy shows he is the dominant force of the two. It's Mulcahy who becomes more violent with the threats and the verbal insults and Mulcahy who threatens to mutilate them with the knife.'</p> <p>The attack was so complicated that the two attackers must have had complete confidence and trust in each other. 'It shows two men, each knowing exactly what the other was doing, confident that one of them isn't going to run off in panic at what the other has done,' said Mark Dennis, the barrister who would put the case for the prosecution in court.</p> <p>Over the next months, the prosecution team were busy finding witnesses who would confirm that Duffy and Mulcahy were close friends from a young age through to their early twenties when the attacks started. Mulcahy had admitted he knew Duffy but maintained that, during the crucial period between 1982 and 1986, they were no longer friends.</p> <p>CPS lawyer Alison Saunders sifted through 8,000 witness statements. A picture began to build up. Duffy was a loner with no other known friends. Crucially, witness after witness confirmed they were still the best of friends and, although both married, they would be out together at weekends until the early hours, the very times that the railway rapes and murders had taken place.</p> <p>Duffy was the key witness but the prosecution team also had crucial pieces of forensic evidence. One of the problems with reinvestigating old cases is that the original exhibits have often disappeared or been destroyed. But this is countered by huge advances in scientific techniques.</p> <p>Some of the exhibits from the original inquiry were sent for DNA analysis, a technique not available to investigators in 1986 and the results were a breakthrough: DNA found on two articles of clothing belonging to one of the rape victims matched that of David Mulcahy.</p> <p>There was also one more piece of compelling forensic evidence. A fingerprint found on a piece of masking tape used to gag one of the victims matched that of Mulcahy. It was powerful evidence but the prosecution team always knew that it still may not be enough to convict. The defence could argue that the police deliberately contaminated the evidence to catch a man they'd wanted for years.</p> <p>When David Mulcahy was found guilty of all 15 counts at the Old Bailey on Friday, it ended a 15-year-struggle to win justice at a cost of more than \u00a32 million. The CPS had been working on the case for two years. It was one of the longest murder trials ever to take place in this country.</p> <p>\u0095 The author produced and directed 'The Trial of the Railway Rapist'. Channel 4, Tuesday, 10pm</p>",

It was with this in mind that we set off that winter's morning to visit the scene in East Horsley, Surrey, where in April 1986, Maartje Tamboezer, 15, was raped and murdered. Police led us through Duffy's horrifying account of how he and Mulcahy first spotted their victim, grabbed her from her bike and subjected her to a long and terrifying walk through fields. According to Duffy, he then raped her alone before handing her back to Mulcahy, who hit her across the face with a stone, put a belt around her neck and told Duffy to strangle her. The East Horsley visit made one significant contribution to the prosecution case: it was clear from visiting the scene of Tamboezer's murder that Duffy could not have carried out the attack alone. The distance covered, the disposal of the bike, the fact that no one had heard screaming or seen signs of a struggle, all pointed to the fact that two men must have overpowered the girl. Duffy had confessed to being one of the men. But was Mulcahy the second man? The prosecution could not rely on the evidence of a rapist and murderer. It had to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mulcahy had been the second man. The defence, of course, would try to knock holes in that case. And unlike the prosecution, which has to prove its case, the defence merely has to introduce doubt in order to win. We then visited the scene of the murder of Alison Day, killed in December 1985 near Hackney Wick BR station in north-east London. According to Duffy, the attack involved taking the victim on a walk along railway tracks and canal paths and under a bridge where the two men raped her. At one point, Mulcahy made her walk, at knifepoint, along a thin ledge on the outside of the bridge crossing the canal. According to Duffy, Alison fell into the canal, was pulled out, raped by Mulcahy again and then strangled by him. As the prosecution team examined the ledge of the bridge along which Alison Day was forced to walk, Andy Murphy, head of the police inquiry, said: 'You can see the violence increasing with the rapes. Mulcahy shows he is the dominant force of the two. It's Mulcahy who becomes more violent with the threats and the verbal insults and Mulcahy who threatens to mutilate them with the knife.' The attack was so complicated that the two attackers must have had complete confidence and trust in each other. 'It shows two men, each knowing exactly what the other was doing, confident that one of them isn't going to run off in panic at what the other has done,' said Mark Dennis, the barrister who would put the case for the prosecution in court. Over the next months, the prosecution team were busy finding witnesses who would confirm that Duffy and Mulcahy were close friends from a young age through to their early twenties when the attacks started. Mulcahy had admitted he knew Duffy but maintained that, during the crucial period between 1982 and 1986, they were no longer friends. CPS lawyer Alison Saunders sifted through 8,000 witness statements. A picture began to build up. Duffy was a loner with no other known friends. Crucially, witness after witness confirmed they were still the best of friends and, although both married, they would be out together at weekends until the early hours, the very times that the railway rapes and murders had taken place. Duffy was the key witness but the prosecution team also had crucial pieces of forensic evidence. One of the problems with reinvestigating old cases is that the original exhibits have often disappeared or been destroyed. But this is countered by huge advances in scientific techniques. Some of the exhibits from the original inquiry were sent for DNA analysis, a technique not available to investigators in 1986 and the results were a breakthrough: DNA found on two articles of clothing belonging to one of the rape victims matched that of David Mulcahy. There was also one more piece of compelling forensic evidence. A fingerprint found on a piece of masking tape used to gag one of the victims matched that of Mulcahy. It was powerful evidence but the prosecution team always knew that it still may not be enough to convict. The defence could argue that the police deliberately contaminated the evidence to catch a man they'd wanted for years. When David Mulcahy was found guilty of all 15 counts at the Old Bailey on Friday, it ended a 15-year-struggle to win justice at a cost of more than \u00a32 million. The CPS had been working on the case for two years. It was one of the longest murder trials ever to take place in this country. \u0095 The author produced and directed 'The Trial of the Railway Rapist'. Channel 4, Tuesday, 10pm",

Prepared secretly by Montesinos in the course of a decade, they show in extraordinary detail how the two men corrupted senators, editors, businessmen and army chiefs in South America's biggest political scandal in decades.</p> <p>Suddenly the most closely guarded secrets of the Fujimori years are in the open, scandalising and intriguing Peruvian society in equal measure as new tapes emerge almost daily, detailing the sexual peccadillos and graft of Peru's \u00e9lite that were then used by Montesinos to blackmail, reward and control them for Fujimori.</p> <p>The tapes have emerged like a vast, unravelling South American soap opera, dominating the television and radio chat shows and filling local papers and magazines since the first revelations in September.</p> <p>And the wounds that the tapes have opened in Peruvian society are unlikely to heal for a long time.</p> <p>Already they have damaged several of the candidates for the 8 April elections to replace Fujimori, who was forced to resign and flee the country in November over corruption allegations.</p> <p>Fujimori is now in exile in Japan. Montesinos has simply disappeared, last heard of having plastic surgery to alter his appearance at a private clinic in Venezuela.</p> <p>While the absent figures of Fujimori and Montesinos loom large over the scandal, attention has turned from the fugitives to the luminaries they implicated in their corruption.</p> <p>Among those who have already been disgraced by videos already in public circulation are the editor of the Expreson newspaper, Edu-ardo Cammell del Solar, who appears in one video recorded by Montesinos in 1998 receiving a bribe of $2 million.</p> <p>In other videotapes so far released, Montesinos - who was a close associate of the CIA - is seen manipulating everything from arms deals to mining concessions to fixing the election won by Fujimori last May that led to his downfall.</p> <p>All of Peru is now waiting for details of the contents of the tapes yet to be examined by the anti-corruption commission overseeing the unravelling of Fujimori's and Montesino's rule.</p> <p>Alejandro Toledo, who ran against Fujimori in last year's elections and is one of the front-runners in the present presidential campaign, has been forced to admit that a tape exists showing him having extra-marital sex. Toledo explains his predicament by saying he was kidnapped and set up by Montesino's agents. Other tapes yet to emerge are reported to show leading figures patronising a brothel and taking drugs.</p> <p>In another tape, one that has since disappeared, leading to suspicions that Montesinos can still count on some of his agents, he is seen meeting three of the country's most senior judges, including Alipio Montes de Oca who headed the electoral commission last May. In the video Montesinos offers Montes de Oca a monthly salary of $10,000.</p> <p>The scale of the scandal is also causing headaches for those trying to investigate the scope of the corruption. Peru's congress was last month forced to suspend the work of a commission investigating the origins of some $80m held in Montesinos's foreign bank accounts after a tape was discovered showing one of its members receiving a campaign contribution from one of Montesinos's allies.</p> <p>That videotape was particularly shocking to Peruvians because it apparently showed that congressman Ernesto Gamarra - long one of Montesinos's most strident public critics - was in the pay of the spymaster to limit any investigations into his spy network. Gamarra has denied any wrongdoing, but he has been thrown out of his party.</p> <p>'The videos show that Montesinos had absolute control over the public institutions of this country,' Jos\u00e9 Ugaz, the state attorney who is leading the government's investigation into the former spy chief's activities, told the New York Times this weekend. 'And he taped absolutely everything.' By Ugaz's count, the tapes have already helped lead to the arrests of eight active and retired generals, one Fujimori Cabinet Minister, two senior government prosecutors and one mayor.</p> <p>Now the biggest problem facing the investigators is how to view all the tapes before the presidential elections. While Montesinos may have been careless in keeping so much incriminating evidence of his own wrong-doing, he took the precaution at least of electronically scrambling much of the material, requiring painstaking decoding.</p>",

Prepared secretly by Montesinos in the course of a decade, they show in extraordinary detail how the two men corrupted senators, editors, businessmen and army chiefs in South America's biggest political scandal in decades. Suddenly the most closely guarded secrets of the Fujimori years are in the open, scandalising and intriguing Peruvian society in equal measure as new tapes emerge almost daily, detailing the sexual peccadillos and graft of Peru's \u00e9lite that were then used by Montesinos to blackmail, reward and control them for Fujimori. The tapes have emerged like a vast, unravelling South American soap opera, dominating the television and radio chat shows and filling local papers and magazines since the first revelations in September. And the wounds that the tapes have opened in Peruvian society are unlikely to heal for a long time. Already they have damaged several of the candidates for the 8 April elections to replace Fujimori, who was forced to resign and flee the country in November over corruption allegations. Fujimori is now in exile in Japan. Montesinos has simply disappeared, last heard of having plastic surgery to alter his appearance at a private clinic in Venezuela. While the absent figures of Fujimori and Montesinos loom large over the scandal, attention has turned from the fugitives to the luminaries they implicated in their corruption. Among those who have already been disgraced by videos already in public circulation are the editor of the Expreson newspaper, Edu-ardo Cammell del Solar, who appears in one video recorded by Montesinos in 1998 receiving a bribe of $2 million. In other videotapes so far released, Montesinos - who was a close associate of the CIA - is seen manipulating everything from arms deals to mining concessions to fixing the election won by Fujimori last May that led to his downfall. All of Peru is now waiting for details of the contents of the tapes yet to be examined by the anti-corruption commission overseeing the unravelling of Fujimori's and Montesino's rule. Alejandro Toledo, who ran against Fujimori in last year's elections and is one of the front-runners in the present presidential campaign, has been forced to admit that a tape exists showing him having extra-marital sex. Toledo explains his predicament by saying he was kidnapped and set up by Montesino's agents. Other tapes yet to emerge are reported to show leading figures patronising a brothel and taking drugs. In another tape, one that has since disappeared, leading to suspicions that Montesinos can still count on some of his agents, he is seen meeting three of the country's most senior judges, including Alipio Montes de Oca who headed the electoral commission last May. In the video Montesinos offers Montes de Oca a monthly salary of $10,000. The scale of the scandal is also causing headaches for those trying to investigate the scope of the corruption. Peru's congress was last month forced to suspend the work of a commission investigating the origins of some $80m held in Montesinos's foreign bank accounts after a tape was discovered showing one of its members receiving a campaign contribution from one of Montesinos's allies. That videotape was particularly shocking to Peruvians because it apparently showed that congressman Ernesto Gamarra - long one of Montesinos's most strident public critics - was in the pay of the spymaster to limit any investigations into his spy network. Gamarra has denied any wrongdoing, but he has been thrown out of his party. 'The videos show that Montesinos had absolute control over the public institutions of this country,' Jos\u00e9 Ugaz, the state attorney who is leading the government's investigation into the former spy chief's activities, told the New York Times this weekend. 'And he taped absolutely everything.' By Ugaz's count, the tapes have already helped lead to the arrests of eight active and retired generals, one Fujimori Cabinet Minister, two senior government prosecutors and one mayor. Now the biggest problem facing the investigators is how to view all the tapes before the presidential elections. While Montesinos may have been careless in keeping so much incriminating evidence of his own wrong-doing, he took the precaution at least of electronically scrambling much of the material, requiring painstaking decoding.",

Alfred Sirven has already warned he has information that would 'blow up the republic 20 times'. The 74-year-old former Resistance fighter, allegedly the mastermind of a multi-million pound slush fund when he was an executive at state-owned oil giant Elf-Aquitaine in the early 90s, was arrested in the Philippines on Friday after eluding French justice for four years. Last night, French hopes of putting Sirven on trial suffered a setback when he was detained in Frankfurt. German authorities refused to transfer Sirven to a plane waiting to take him to Paris, insisting on full extradition proceedings. Yesterday Sirven said: 'If I am forced to speak, it will be at the risk and peril of those who force me. 'I could hand over at least 100 names,' he added, words that will send a chill down the spines of many of those embroiled in an affair that has exposed the extent of state corruption during the presidency of the late Francois Mitterrand. The country's biggest postwar corruption trial has heard evidence that the rakish former foreign minister Roland Dumas, his elegant ex-lover Christine Deviers-Joncour and five Elf executives including Sirven siphoned off millions of pounds worth of the com pany's funds and lived luxuriously on the proceeds. Dumas, 78, is accused of forcing Elf to employ Deviers-Joncour, 53, in a highly-paid job with next to no duties. But while the others faced the music in court, Sirven was holed up in a luxury villa near Manila and tried in absentia. Yesterday Sirven denied the corruption charges against him and said he had nothing to fear from being extradited to France. 'I swear on my grandchildren that everything that has been said about me is not true,' he said. A Frankfurt judge's insistence that he face full extradition hearings in Germany next week caught French officials by surprise. The German authorities may want to question him over some 256 million francs (about \u00a330 million) allegedly paid by Elf in commissions during its 1992 purchase of the Leuna oil refinery in eastern Germany. Tomorrow in Paris presiding judge Sophie Portier will hear a motion calling for proceedings to be suspended in the light of Sirven's arrest.",

The jury that sentenced him to death in 1985 heard nothing about his catastrophic childhood, when he sustained severe head injuries, nor a rare medical condition which made him prone to blackouts and out-of-character psychotic rages. It was also unaware that when Housel was being interrogated by police, he was being held in inhumane conditions, and repeatedly assaulted with an electric prod.</p> <p>Despite his long incarceration, it was only last week that the Foreign Office confirmed Housel was born and remains a British national. In an email to Clive Stafford-Smith, the New Orleans-based British lawyer, Mike Tiney, a senior Consular Department official, said: 'We will be seeking advice from the Consul-General in Atlanta as to whether representations should be made at this time, and if so to whom.'</p> <p>The disclosure of Housel's plight and British nationality will add to Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's difficulties in attempting to maintain the 'special relationship' with the United States as he travels to Washington this week to meet the new President, George W.

In his six years as Governor of Texas, Bush was responsible for 139 executions, far more than any governor in American history. Cook is certain to come under heavy pressure from human rights groups to raise the case of Housel at their meeting.</p> <p>Housel is British by virtue of his birth at the King Edward VII hospital in Bermuda, where his parents were working and where he spent his infancy. His mother, Lula, who came from a dirt-poor background in North Carolina, was only 14 when she married Bill Housel, who was 43. Tracy was born the following year.</p> <p>His childhood, spent in impoverished circumstances in North Carolina and Columbia Heights, Rhode Island, a ruined former mill town, was marked by serious illness and injury. He suffered constant headaches and fevers, for which his father - who 'did not believe' in doctors - refused to seek medical help. At the age of seven, he fell off a roof and was knocked unconscious. Badly concussed, his pupils were dilated for several days. Later he was concussed again when another child attacked him with a baseball bat. Finally, at the age of 11, he sustained brain damage after losing consciousness again in a car crash.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bill and Lula became abusive alcoholics. Witnesses at Housel's appeals described how Tracy would try to end their fist-fights, only to find both parents turn their anger on him. After one such incident when he was 14, he ran to the home of one of Lula's friends. When she called his mother, Lula responded: 'If you've got him, you can fucking keep him. Come get his shit.' He ended up staying for three months, and soon after his return, left home for good.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, Housel moved to Iowa, where he formed a relationship with a widow, Robin Banks. Most of the time he was relaxed and easy-going, and acted as a loving father to her children. But he was also prone to sudden mood swings, when he would fail to eat for days on end and drink and take drugs.</p> <p>It was not until years after Housel's trial that his appeal lawyers, Beth Wells and Robert McGlasson, had him examined by two mental health experts and several leading neuro-physicians. They later testified that he suffered from an extreme form of an endocrine disorder, hypoglycaemia, which made him prone to periods when he would lose control of his actions and became unable to distinguish right from wrong. They added that all the available evidence suggested it was during such a psychotic episode that he committed the crime for which he was sentenced to death.</p> <p>Aside from a single conviction for soliciting a prostitute, he had no criminal record when in early 1985, following the break-up of his relationship, he embarked on a violent two-week odyssey across the United States. Police claimed he was responsible for a catalogue of heinous crimes during this fortnight: a near-fatal knife assault on a man in Iowa; raping and cudgeling a man to death in Texas; forcing a woman to perform oral sex in New Jersey; and finally, the beating and fatal strangling of Jean Drew in Gwinnett County, Georgia.</p> <p>Housel was eventually arrested for her murder in Florida, when he tried to use her credit card to buy a cowboy outfit. He confessed to the killing, saying they had consensual sex after he picked her up at an Atlanta truck-stop, but he had then become enraged and perpetrated his murderous attack.</p> <p>This was the only crime with which he was charged. However, the jury, which had to decide if he should live or die, heard details of these other alleged offences, although his guilt had not been established. Earlier, detectives had repeatedly interrogated him about them as he awaited trial in the Gwinnett County jail. After seeking advice from the FBI, they decided to hold these interviews at night. In the jail, he was held in solitary confinement, denied showers and exercise for more than three months, and 'punished' with an electric stun gun, at least once - according to evidence from his fellow prisoners - while standing in water, in order to intensify the pain.</p> <p>Housel's trial lawyer, Walt Brit, was recently qualified, and had never handled a murder case. In later appeal hearings, he admitted he made no attempt to ascertain the facts of Housel's abusive background, nor his medical state.</p> <p>In advising him to plead guilty, he had deprived him of a possible defence of insanity; had he known the full facts, Brit said, he would never have given such advice.</p> <p>There were two main grounds to Housel's appeal to the 11th Federal Circuit Court: that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to effective legal counsel; and that, by adducing evidence of crimes which were unproved, the prosecution deprived him of a fair hearing over whether he should get life or death, rendering his execution a cruel and unusual punishment.</p> <p>On 18 January the three appeal judges, led by a keen advocate of the death penalty, rejected all Housel's arguments.

      "body": "<p>It's called rough music. 'Saucepans, frying-pans, pokers and tongs, marrow-bones and cleavers, bulls' horns, etc, beaten upon and sounded in ludicrous procession,' according to Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue in 1796; it's been with us for a long, long time, as a weapon - wielded most usually by the women of the community - to humiliate or scare a neighbour suspected of filthy morals. So nobody should, in all honesty, have affected shocked surprise, as if this were some new modern outrage when, for seven days last August, the women and children of the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth, led by 33-year-old Katrina Kessell, marched and shouted and swore and bayed for the blood of local paedophiles.</p> <p>But the scenes were still fiercely ugly, in Paulsgrove and elsewhere, particularly to London commentators, of all political hues, who thought this kind of behaviour had been consigned to history along with buboes and ducking-stools. The condemnation was swift and righteous, and made more sustained by anger at the News of the World's 'name and shame' campaign, and the violent stupidity of the mobs it whipped up in the weeks following Sarah Payne's murder. Innocent families were hounded from their homes while convicted paedophiles went safely awol. A group in Gwent attacked a paediatrician by mistake. And right at the centre of it all, it seemed, was this spiky-haired Portsmouth harridan, self-appointed mouthpiece for the worst of the mobs, who became, last week, the first person to be convicted of public-order offences during that tawdry summer.</p> <p>What might surprise us instead is the fact that Katrina Kessell possesses not a brutal manipulative cynicism but a distressing naivety. She is far more vulnerable and nuanced than the cuttings - with their talk of 'aliens' and 'monsters' among us - would suggest. She's wrong-headed and self-deluding, and not given to lengthy discussion of such abstract concepts as irony, principle or the Rule of Law, but she's still not the cardboard cut-out tricoteuse of stereotyping.</p> <p>She's angry, for instance, at that News of the World campaign. 'I think they were wrong; they shouldn't have done it that way. I think it was all too cynical. And I don't think they checked everyone properly, which allowed mistakes, and damaged all of us.' She had been campaigning, she explained, for about a year before the paper's first 'outing', of convicted paedophile Victor Burnett, to have him removed from Paulsgrove. 'We'd been trying for a long time. Parents complained to police. People said things to Burnett. But their statements were just \"noted\" and nothing happened.</p> <p>'Anyway, after the paper came out, other people saw his picture and it kicked off. I went down to the green that night with the rest. There were a lot of people there, just chatting. And I suppose I found myself being shoved up the front. Sometimes I have a big mouth, I'm not afraid to say what I want to say, and I knew about Burnett.' And so she became spokeswoman and leader, and so was born Residents Against Paedophiles - and seven nights of foul vigilantism.</p> <p>Kessell accepts that it wasn't pretty. 'Yes, there can be something ugly about a mob.' And the use of the tiniest of children, chanting 'sex beast!' and 'hang him!'?</p> <p>'Yes, I know, some of that was out of order; they didn't really know what a paedophile was. But they do now.

'If a name came up we wouldn't do anything until we'd checked the library,' says Kessell. 'If a case went to court it would go in the papers; if it wasn't in the papers it wasn't proved.'</p> <p>They're wrong, of course.

She is also careful to distinguish between types of offence, distrusting the scatter-gun approach which brands anyone who has sex with an under-age girl as a paedophile; 'it's not paedophilia if they're given consent. I'm talking about the little ones. The ones who have no idea what's happening.'</p> <p>Such as herself. She talks quietly, hesitantly, with her mother out of the room, of the drive behind her anger, her own sexual abuse at the ages of five and six by her paternal grandfather. 'I was convinced I was just getting extra affection and attention. And no, I still haven't dealt with it, and I don't think I ever will. How do you deal with that? I'll take it to the grave.'</p> <p>Later, she was further abused after she was put into care by her mother. 'I had all of them, all on my own,' says Canizares defensively, 'and her and her brother were legging it off everywhere but I had three babies in the house so I was breaking the law if I went looking for them, so I went to the social services and asked how to cope and they couldn't help so I said fine, take them off my hands.' Did Kessell now, I asked, resent her mother for this? She shook her head. 'Not now, no. I've got children of my own, I know what it's like.' Five, in fact.

Katrina Kessell got a result. Wrongly, stupidly, illegally, and helped by some brutal manipulative cynicism from rich journalists, she got a result.

      "bodyText": "It's called rough music. 'Saucepans, frying-pans, pokers and tongs, marrow-bones and cleavers, bulls' horns, etc, beaten upon and sounded in ludicrous procession,' according to Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue in 1796; it's been with us for a long, long time, as a weapon - wielded most usually by the women of the community - to humiliate or scare a neighbour suspected of filthy morals. So nobody should, in all honesty, have affected shocked surprise, as if this were some new modern outrage when, for seven days last August, the women and children of the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth, led by 33-year-old Katrina Kessell, marched and shouted and swore and bayed for the blood of local paedophiles. But the scenes were still fiercely ugly, in Paulsgrove and elsewhere, particularly to London commentators, of all political hues, who thought this kind of behaviour had been consigned to history along with buboes and ducking-stools. The condemnation was swift and righteous, and made more sustained by anger at the News of the World's 'name and shame' campaign, and the violent stupidity of the mobs it whipped up in the weeks following Sarah Payne's murder. Innocent families were hounded from their homes while convicted paedophiles went safely awol. A group in Gwent attacked a paediatrician by mistake. And right at the centre of it all, it seemed, was this spiky-haired Portsmouth harridan, self-appointed mouthpiece for the worst of the mobs, who became, last week, the first person to be convicted of public-order offences during that tawdry summer. What might surprise us instead is the fact that Katrina Kessell possesses not a brutal manipulative cynicism but a distressing naivety. She is far more vulnerable and nuanced than the cuttings - with their talk of 'aliens' and 'monsters' among us - would suggest. She's wrong-headed and self-deluding, and not given to lengthy discussion of such abstract concepts as irony, principle or the Rule of Law, but she's still not the cardboard cut-out tricoteuse of stereotyping. She's angry, for instance, at that News of the World campaign. 'I think they were wrong; they shouldn't have done it that way. I think it was all too cynical. And I don't think they checked everyone properly, which allowed mistakes, and damaged all of us.' She had been campaigning, she explained, for about a year before the paper's first 'outing', of convicted paedophile Victor Burnett, to have him removed from Paulsgrove. 'We'd been trying for a long time. Parents complained to police. People said things to Burnett. But their statements were just \"noted\" and nothing happened. 'Anyway, after the paper came out, other people saw his picture and it kicked off. I went down to the green that night with the rest. There were a lot of people there, just chatting. And I suppose I found myself being shoved up the front. Sometimes I have a big mouth, I'm not afraid to say what I want to say, and I knew about Burnett.' And so she became spokeswoman and leader, and so was born Residents Against Paedophiles - and seven nights of foul vigilantism. Kessell accepts that it wasn't pretty. 'Yes, there can be something ugly about a mob.' And the use of the tiniest of children, chanting 'sex beast!' and 'hang him!'? 'Yes, I know, some of that was out of order; they didn't really know what a paedophile was. But they do now. And you're right, I couldn't control everything. Every protest is going to have hangers-on. We tried to tell some of the teenagers to calm down. But, look, how else do you get noticed? How else is anyone going to listen to a common person like me? Even the local papers weren't interested before, let alone the nationals. At least we were being listened to, and we got something done.

They're wrong, of course. At least four innocent families fled the estate, and at least one convicted paedophile went to ground.

      "body": "<p>It was how her life was meant to be, but not how it turned out. For nine years, Kathy Blackburn tried a succession of six different fertility treatments, never taking holidays, only working as a temp so she would have flexibility to make hospital appointments.</p> <p>She even tried superstition: she bought Babygros and slept with them under her pillow. Then, aged 30, Kathy made the decision she had been desperately trying to avoid: to give up trying and accept she would never have a baby.</p> <p>'I grew up with the fairy tale that you get married and have children and live happily ever after, and when that doesn't happen, you think: who am I?', she said. Her marriage failed, she had a breakdown, she felt suicidal. 'I found myself in my car with my foot down thinking I don't give a toss. I lost the plot. I felt so isolated,' said Kathy, 33, who now has a new partner and a full-time job.</p> <p>Kathy is among the one in six adults who has problems with fertility, which affects men and women equally. Despite all the advances in fertility treatments, many remain unable to have any children of their own. There are few reliable figures, but it is thought around one in 10 couples is childless involuntarily. Many suffer depression, and one in five considers suicide. One in three of such couples breaks up, blaming childlessness as the cause.</p> <p>Tomorrow the first British charity aimed at helping the involuntary childless, MoreToLife, is officially launched.</p> <p>'There's been no support for people who have not being going through treatment. The biggest problem of involuntary childlessness is loneliness and isolation,' said Joe Thompson, national co-ordinator of MoreToLife, which has set up support groups in all parts of the country. He added: 'One of the first things people want to talk about is, quite simply, the meaning of life.'</p> <p>Until now, despite the multitude of groups prepared to help couples through fertility treatment, there was nobody around once couples decided to stop trying.</p> <p>Involuntary childlessness is a problem that stalks people before they even know they are set to suffer it. After having treatment comes the even more painful decision to stop having it.</p> <p>Kathy and her husband unsuccessfully tried to have a baby for a year before they sought help. The first effort involved artificial insemination by her husband, which they tried monthly over a year. Doctors then found he was producing poor sperm and put him on steroids. When that didn't work, they tried in vitro fertilisation (IVF) - the treatment to produce 'test-tube' babies. That, too, was doomed to failure.</p> <p>'Every time I failed, I said I'm not going to do it again, and I always did. You fall in love with the idea of having children,' said Kathy, who lives outside Norwich. 'You get very hurt and angry. It's like being on an emotional roller-coaster. You're upset anyway and they pump you full of hormones that make it far worse. Sex became just sex, making love was out the window.'</p> <p>After the failure to conceive with her husband's sperm, she tried artificial insemination from a donor. She then discovered she had dysfunctional ovaries, and the doctors tried a new technique injecting the sperm as high up the uterus as possible, a process she went through six times. Finally they tried a new technique, ICSI, where the sperm was injected straight into one of her eggs. It did not work.</p> <p>'Then I decided I couldn't take any more,' she said. 'I'd fought for funding, I fought for treatment, but then I was the one who had given up. I regret how much it took over my life. I should have said five years is enough, but with new treatments constantly developed you always think there's something else you can do, or another doctor who can make a difference.'</p> <p>Even for those who have not endured Kathy's experience, the decision to give up can be heart-breaking, and the regrets just as strong. Suzanne, who did not want to give her real name, spent thousands of pounds trying IVF treatment twice. 'You go for a scan and are told everything's fine, and you're on a high, and then you go along and you're told it doesn't work. Every month is a cycle of hope and despair. It becomes an obsession, it's all you can think about. You think let's not book a holiday, maybe I'll be pregnant,' she said.</p> <p>'It was one of the hardest decisions in my life to stop. You have to realise you can't have everything you want in life. I always thought as soon as I wanted a child it would happen. It came as a shock. Having a child is a gift,' she said.</p> <p>For Suzanne, a teacher, the regrets are not that she tried for so long, but that she left it so late. 'I was 37, I had put my career first. I think, if only I hadn't been so career-minded.'</p> <p>Failing at fertility treatment is far from rare. Although IVF in particular is often seen as a miracle cure, it has a low success rate. There are some clinics with only a 5 per cent chance of success per cycle; the most successful clinic, in London, has a success rate of 40 per cent. Overall, about half of those who try fertility treatment will be successful, with an average of three attempts. In some parts of the country the NHS will pay, in others recipients must produce \u00a33,000 for each attempt. Some people have ended up mortgaging their houses to pay for th treatment. 'Stopping is difficult because you have to come to terms not only that you will have no children, but the fact that you have wasted three years of your life trying, and wasted \u00a310,000 for nothing,' said Phil Holm, director of Issue, the national fertility charity.</p> <p>But even once the decision has been made, the involuntary childless have to come to terms with the fact they failed to have children, they will never have them and with the bitter reality that most of their friends do.</p> <p>'It destroyed my marriage. Being part of my marriage was being part of a failed situation,' said Kathy. Sex remained difficult. 'Having sex is a reminder of not being able to conceive, it put me off for a while.'</p> <p>Even sustaining friendships became a chore. 'Everyone else was going for a Chinese takeaway and \"bang!\" a month later they're pregnant. You get very envious. You're not part of the conversations. They don't know what to say to me, and I don't know what to say to them. I have lost friends on the way.'</p> <p>Then even mundane daily life can become cruel. If you want children and know you can't have them, things other people don't even notice become a source of pain.</p> <p>'There's always two aisles in the supermarket you never get to go down. There's always a special part in the supermarket for mums with babies. They're part of an exclusive club. Buying things for other people's children is very hard. I find it very hard to watch people breastfeed,' said Kathy. 'Christmas, which is so based around children, is particularly hard.'</p> <p>Popular culture doesn't help. Babies are now high fashion with pop stars and actors delighting in parading their charges across the pages of glossy mag azines and newspapers. Images of David and Victoria Beckham, Madonna and Guy Ritchie, add to the anguish for those who will never be parents.</p> <p>For some, the isolation is deepened by the fact that being involuntarily childless is largely a taboo subject. Many couples report feeling that they have to pretend they didn't actually want children.</p> <p>Anthony Bertram, who runs a company supplying knives to London restaurants, spent four years trying for babies with his wife Carolyn, but an endless round of medical tests showed he was azoospermic, producing no sperm at all.</p> <p>'It was immensely difficult. We're normal people - we saw our lives in terms of weddings, children, and funerals, and you have to reassess what you are all about. You start asking why you are here,' he said. 'It affects your self-esteem no end. But you are here for lots of reasons, there are many ways you can contribute - I run a family business.'</p> <p>Some involuntary childless set out to find new meaning by doing new work. Kathy now has a full-time job in Anglia Water, and has worked hard to prove herself. 'I substituted my failure at having a family to being bloody good at work.'</p> <p>Others take up new activities in their spare time. 'I thought my life would be meaningless without them. Now I see I do have a purpose in life, even without children. I have to remind myself I am just as worthy as anyone else,' said Suzanne.</p> <p>Already a teacher, she now does extra voluntary work with children. Her husband has developed an absorbing sideline as an artist. 'If I can't have what I want, I have to look elsewhere to fulfil my maternal instincts - I work with children and have cats,' she said.</p> <p>There are also positive aspects to being childless - and not just in saving money. Many people deliberately chose to have no babies. 'On Sunday mornings, you don't have to get up. You do what you want to do, you have holidays when you want. I have a big motorbike - that's my toy,' said Anthony.</p> <p>Eventually, life returns to a more even keel. 'I've got my life back now; I've got stability. I've gone from someone who was trying to have a child to someone who could never have one,' said Kathy. When people ask her if she has children, she doesn't say she doesn't have any, but 'I can't have any'.</p> <p>'I'm more at peace now,' said Suzanne - although she's still wary of the future. 'It'll be difficult when my friends are grandparents and have grandchildren running around. At least I have a nephew and nieces, but it'll be difficult.'</p> <p><b>The quest for parenthood</b><br><br>\u0095 One in six people is affected by infertility at some point of his or her life</p> <p>\u0095 The problem lies with the man's fertility a third of the time, the woman's a third of the time, and a combination about 20 per cent of the time.

You start asking why you are here,' he said. 'It affects your self-esteem no end. But you are here for lots of reasons, there are many ways you can contribute - I run a family business.' Some involuntary childless set out to find new meaning by doing new work. Kathy now has a full-time job in Anglia Water, and has worked hard to prove herself. 'I substituted my failure at having a family to being bloody good at work.' Others take up new activities in their spare time. 'I thought my life would be meaningless without them. Now I see I do have a purpose in life, even without children. I have to remind myself I am just as worthy as anyone else,' said Suzanne. Already a teacher, she now does extra voluntary work with children. Her husband has developed an absorbing sideline as an artist. 'If I can't have what I want, I have to look elsewhere to fulfil my maternal instincts - I work with children and have cats,' she said. There are also positive aspects to being childless - and not just in saving money. Many people deliberately chose to have no babies. 'On Sunday mornings, you don't have to get up. You do what you want to do, you have holidays when you want. I have a big motorbike - that's my toy,' said Anthony. Eventually, life returns to a more even keel. 'I've got my life back now; I've got stability. I've gone from someone who was trying to have a child to someone who could never have one,' said Kathy. When people ask her if she has children, she doesn't say she doesn't have any, but 'I can't have any'. 'I'm more at peace now,' said Suzanne - although she's still wary of the future. 'It'll be difficult when my friends are grandparents and have grandchildren running around. At least I have a nephew and nieces, but it'll be difficult.' The quest for parenthood \u0095 One in six people is affected by infertility at some point of his or her life \u0095 The problem lies with the man's fertility a third of the time, the woman's a third of the time, and a combination about 20 per cent of the time. In about 10 per cent of cases, the cause of infertility is unknown \u0095 Almost 30,000 couples receive fertility treatment each year in Britain, an increase of 55 per cent in the last five years \u0095 One in 80 children is conceived with medical help \u0095 On average, those going through fertility treatment make three attempts before being successful or giving up \u0095 About half of those going through fertility treatment are unsuccessful \u0095 About one in 10 couples are involuntarily childless \u0095 One in three involuntarily childless couples break down \u0095 One in five involuntarily childless couples consider suicide anthony.browne@observer.co.uk MoreToLife's helpline is 070 500 37905 Useful links: www.moretolife.co.uk New support for the involuntarily childless www.issue.co.uk The national fertility charity, Issue",

He was cut down from the noose but died the following day in hospital.</p> <p>That was on 9 February last year. Now the inquest into his death has refocused attention on a 'three strikes and you're out' law in the states of Northern Territory and Western Australia which requires the courts to jail any juvenile on his third conviction for a property crime.</p> <p>The rule has been fiercely attacked by Australia's other states and the United Nations. Legal critics describe the law as 'draconian and racist', saying it unfairly discriminates against Aborigines because poverty forces them into petty property offences. The rule does not apply to more serious offences or white-collar crime.</p> <p>Mandatory jail terms have recently been handed out to people for stealing slices of pizza, a bottle of cheap whisky and a half-drunk bottle of warm, flat beer.</p> <p>Benjamin himself was sentenced to a mandatory 28 days in jail after he unlawfully entered a building in Groote Eylandt, east of Darwin, and stole paint and pens worth less than \u00a340.</p> <p>The inquest heard last week that he was failed at every turn by the authorities. Although it was his third time before the Bench, his first had been as a minor and should have been disregarded, an error accepted by the Territory's Director of Public Prosecutions, Rex Wild. It was also revealed that alternatives to jail were not offered to the boy by his lawyer, the prosecutor or the magistrate.</p> <p>The inquest was told that before his suicide the boy had displayed clear signs of mental disturbance which had been ignored by the detention centre's staff. Instead they locked him in his room. A few hours later he was found with the sheet around his neck.</p> <p>Louis Schetzer, director of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, said the mandatory sentencing law, introduced in the Territory in 1997, contravened the Convention on Human Rights and ignored recommendations of a Australian Royal Commission on deaths in custody.</p> <p>It has also been condemned by four UN committees, human rights groups, the Labor Party and the Australian Law Council, which represents 36,000 lawyers.</p> <p>'There is overwhelming evidence that the earlier young people penetrate deeply into the criminal justice system, especially through detention, the greater likelihood they will reoffend,' said Schetzer.</p> <p>The president of the Northern Territory Law Society, Jon Tippett, said the law was wrecking Aboriginal communities. 'In Aboriginal communities there is 100 per cent clear-up rate for property crimes. Everybody who commits a crime will be dealt with. In the broader white community the clean-up rate is between 13 and 15 per cent, so inevitably and disproportionately Aboriginals will be imprisoned.'</p> <p>The row has divided Australia's legal community, with senior figures from more liberal states condemning it as misconceived.</p> <p>Victoria's Attorney General, Rob Hulls, said: 'Mandatory sentencing is specifically targeted at young Aboriginal offenders because of the conditions they find themselves in - living in Third World conditions and confronted with situations where they sometimes want for food.'</p> <p>Victoria is planning to build a courtroom where Aboriginal elders will advise magistrates on alternatives to jail, suggesting culturally appropriate sentences such as shaming the offender within the tribe.</p> <p>Benjamin's mother, Hazel Lalara, said: 'This law doesn't get offenders to stop offending. It just gets more of our people in prison, even when they do little things. It's splitting our communities up.'</p> <p>Yet support for mandatory sentencing in Northern Territory and Western Australia is high. Both governments are highlighting it as they go to the polls in state elections this year. Western Australia's Premier, Richard Court, is planning to increase the list of offences carrying a mandatory sentence to include motor vehicle theft from the home.</p>",

Although it was his third time before the Bench, his first had been as a minor and should have been disregarded, an error accepted by the Territory's Director of Public Prosecutions, Rex Wild. It was also revealed that alternatives to jail were not offered to the boy by his lawyer, the prosecutor or the magistrate. The inquest was told that before his suicide the boy had displayed clear signs of mental disturbance which had been ignored by the detention centre's staff. Instead they locked him in his room. A few hours later he was found with the sheet around his neck. Louis Schetzer, director of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, said the mandatory sentencing law, introduced in the Territory in 1997, contravened the Convention on Human Rights and ignored recommendations of a Australian Royal Commission on deaths in custody. It has also been condemned by four UN committees, human rights groups, the Labor Party and the Australian Law Council, which represents 36,000 lawyers. 'There is overwhelming evidence that the earlier young people penetrate deeply into the criminal justice system, especially through detention, the greater likelihood they will reoffend,' said Schetzer. The president of the Northern Territory Law Society, Jon Tippett, said the law was wrecking Aboriginal communities. 'In Aboriginal communities there is 100 per cent clear-up rate for property crimes. Everybody who commits a crime will be dealt with. In the broader white community the clean-up rate is between 13 and 15 per cent, so inevitably and disproportionately Aboriginals will be imprisoned.' The row has divided Australia's legal community, with senior figures from more liberal states condemning it as misconceived. Victoria's Attorney General, Rob Hulls, said: 'Mandatory sentencing is specifically targeted at young Aboriginal offenders because of the conditions they find themselves in - living in Third World conditions and confronted with situations where they sometimes want for food.' Victoria is planning to build a courtroom where Aboriginal elders will advise magistrates on alternatives to jail, suggesting culturally appropriate sentences such as shaming the offender within the tribe. Benjamin's mother, Hazel Lalara, said: 'This law doesn't get offenders to stop offending. It just gets more of our people in prison, even when they do little things. It's splitting our communities up.' Yet support for mandatory sentencing in Northern Territory and Western Australia is high. Both governments are highlighting it as they go to the polls in state elections this year. Western Australia's Premier, Richard Court, is planning to increase the list of offences carrying a mandatory sentence to include motor vehicle theft from the home.",

The National Football League season having ended with the Super Bowl last Sunday, XFL began on American television last night as the league's bastard child. The XFL, conceived by Vince McMahon, the billionaire tsar of the crotch-grabbing, babe-gawking World Wrestling Federation, is billed as a 'more visceral, smash-mouth' version of the game. 'I would suggest the way we're going to cover this is going to revolutionise not only how football is covered, but sports itself,' he says. Believing American football has become too 'panty- waisted', McMahon wants to return to the day when 'the whole idea was to kill the quarterback'. To many Americans, the XFL is set to mark a new low in television broadcasting and for that reason alone it is almost certain to be very successful. 'This latest venture is a blatant attempt to make huge sums of money from a sports-crazed nation addicted to sex and television,' says columnist Bill Koch. With the deep-pocketed backing of broadcasting giant NBC, the XFL has created eight teams of renegade NFL players and coaches prepared to unleash the energy and unrestrained violence that transformed wrestling from the Saturday afternoon spectacle of Giant Haystacks into a billion-dollar operation. Even the names of the teams - Maniax, Xtreme, Outlaws, Rage - leave no doubt what McMahon has in mind. From the start, the game will be amped up.

The catalogue of death in recent times speaks for itself. Fifty-eight Chinese at Dover last year, hundreds drowned annually crossing the Mediterranean to Spain, Italy, and Greece.

We plan to exchange immigration liaison officers between Rome and London within three months, and to favour joint working at ports and airports outside the EU. This will allow us also to enhance bilateral co-operation in certain areas and to prevent and tackle, for example, illegal immigrants using the rail network or transiting the countries of Europe from the Balkans to the UK. We plan to learn from these experiences in planning future exchanges.</p> <p>\u0095 Encourage the EU Police Chiefs' Task Force to drive forward operational work against human traffickers. Trafficking in human beings will be on the agenda for EU police chiefs when they meet in Stockholm on 8 March. We want EU police chiefs to be able to use this, and future meetings, to take forward more joint operations against human trafficking and other major organised crime threats.</p> <p>\u0095 Push for fuller use of Europol and member-state intelligence in fighting human trafficking and people smuggling. We call on member states to join us in committing ourselves fully by sending immigration experts to Europol to increase the exchange of intelligence (for example, against gangs involved in trafficking women) and develop a more tactical focus to identify operational targets. We plan to have our own experts in place within four months.</p> <p>\u0095 Push for tough EU-wide penalties for human trafficking and for transporting illegal immigrants.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has announced urgent measures to stem the flood of up to 50,000 illegal immigrants smuggled by people traffickers through Bosnia and the western Balkans into Europe. It follows the revelation by The Observer last week of the huge scale of migrant trafficking via the notorious 'Sarajevo Route', which the UN estimates now accounts for up to 10% of the illegal immigration into the EU. In an article in today's paper - written with the Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato - Blair unveils a series of measures to target gangs involved in the world's fastest growing criminal activity, worth an estimated $7bn globally last year. They include: \u0095 Sentences of up to 14 years for criminals behind the people trafficking trade who charge up to $4,000 to smuggle migrants through the Balkans; \u0095 The deployment of extra police and immigration officers to Bosnia to help beef up the newly created Bosnian State Border Service; \u0095 Funds for a 'voluntary repatriation' scheme to return would-be migrants to their homes. In addition, Blair - for the first time - publicly throws his weight behind proposals to open up a route of 'legal migration' for skilled workers into Europe, ending almost 30 years of movement towards a 'zero migration' policy. The proposals by Blair and Amato follow the publication late last year by the EU Commission of a discussion document on the future of migration into Europe, calling for managed migration under a US-style 'Green Card' system backed by a tougher enforcement regime on Europe's most vulnerable borders. They fall short, however, of controversial demands by some international experts who want a managed migration scheme into Europe for the unskilled workers who make up the majority of the people traffickers' trade. Home Secretary Jack Straw will pick up the theme in a speech on Tuesday before flying to an informal EU summit in Stockholm at which immigration will top the agenda. Blair's initiative follows the release of official figures showing the UK is the number one target for asylum seekers in Europe. 'Every day we hear of the horrors illegal immigrants endure at the hands of the people-traffickers,' the two Prime Ministers write. 'The catalogue of death in recent times speaks for itself: 58 Chinese at Dover last year, hundreds drowned yearly crossing the Mediterranean to Spain, Italy and Greece. 'There is evidence that traffickers have thrown women and children, many of whom cannot swim, into the Adriatic in the middle of the night simply to avoid detection by police patrol boats. 'In all that we do, we will honour our obligation to provide protection to those fleeing persecution. But we must not allow such tragic loss of life to continue.' Blair's softening of British policy on immigration - for skilled migrants at least - follows statements from Immigration Minister, Barbara Roche, who is working on plans for a limited number of skilled migrants, such as IT workers, to enter Britain. Blair and Amato say the debate 'should focus, not only on the repression of criminal activity connected with immigration, but also on supporting appropriate opportunities, where in the economic and national interest, for legal migration into a diverse and tolerant society'. Other member states have delayed plans for closer EU-wide co-operation, but the UK and Italy are ready to override them, using a 'fast-track' process with tighter controls by a smaller group of interested countries. Blair believes illegal immigration can be controlled only by tackling it before it reaches Britain. Traffickers were driven out of Bosnia by the conflict, but last year began returning in droves, attracted by its continuing lawlessness. In the first 10 months of last year, around 50,000 migrants - mainly from Iraq, Iran, Turkey and China - are estimated to have passed through the region on the way to western Europe. The region is also a haven for the trafficking of drugs, pornography and prostitutes. New checks on lorries coming to Britain through the Channel ports appear to have driven stowaways towards the trains, causing at least two deaths of immigrants trying to cling to freight trains headed for the Channel Tunnel, while another man had his arm torn off.

Perhaps because he writes retrospectively, at a distance from his former object of desire, his book seems to be more about the native land he has now returned to than the city he adopted as an alternative, more permissive home. Paris is recommended, as in the Wildean epigram, because of its dissimilarity to America: the subway is safe, ideas are debated in cafes, and no-one cares about the sexual peccadilloes of politicians. But when it comes to nostalgic alimentary cravings, White rejoices in the subjugation of Europe by American commerce. 'In Paris,' he reports triumphantly, 'you can find Tex-Mex food' - a prospect which doesn't exactly make me itch to phone Eurostar for a reservation. </p> <p>Though his book calls itself a stroll, White does very little walking. (If you really want to be guided to some of the city's more recondite wonders, seek out Le Promeneur de Paris, published in two beautiful, enticing volumes last year by Actes Sud for Paris Mus\u00e9es). There are reverent descriptions of the Sainte-Chapelle or the Louvre courtyard, as well as some cheeky anecdotes about White's cruising days on the Seine embankments, where impromptu sexual entanglements are publicised by the lights from passing tour boats, or voyeuristic visits to the transsexual prostitutes from Brazil who conduct business in the undergrowth of the Bois de Boulogne. But the city's function as an erotic zone is better addressed by Renaud Camus in Tricks, an inventory of alfresco orgasms which - typifying the Parisian accord between sensual indulgence and high-minded intellectuality - boasts a preface by Roland Barthes. </p> <p>Otherwise, White too often retreats from the streets, which are the fl\u00e2neur's proper realm, and takes refuge indoors. He frequents quite a few museums, forbidden to fl\u00e2neurs except on the very wettest days. Even more questionably, he avoids the city centre with its heterodox jumble of humanity and concentrates on the enclaves of marginalised minorities: Arabs, Asians and blacks in the suburbs of Belleville and Barbes, Jews and now gays in the Marais. The chapter on homosexuality abandons strolling altogether in order to complain about France's tardiness in combating Aids. </p> <p>White's interest in racial and sexual outsiders is odd, given his perception that the French do not recognise such politically correct categorisations. Their republic is no confederation of groups with special interests and private gripes; the state treats 'each citizen - regardless of his or her gender, sexual orientation, religion or colour - as an abstract, universal individual'. Then why does he import the rancorous identity politics of the US, and complain that Parisians feel (does he mean fail?) to meet standards they regard as irrelevant? Coming from a country where the social contract has been replaced by that delusive commandment to pursue happiness, White doesn't comprehend the theory of civility which makes Paris so civilised. </p> <p>I recently learnt that a favourite Parisian place of mine, the block of pet shops on the quai near the Samaritaine department store, was under assault from American tourists, who objected to the clean, spacious cages in which the pampered creatures were kept, and threatened to bring class-action law suits on behalf of the rabbits and spaniels.

Just as Joyce's hero is both a Dublin publican and a mythical giant, so Vishnu in The Death of Vishnu, not conscious at any stage of the book, is not just the odd-job man he seems. In the flickering awareness of his last moments, he confronts the possibility that he is in fact an avatar of the god after whom he was named. In a novel by an Indian expatriate shrewdly targeted at an American audience, he experiences something between a Western-style near-death event and the passage of the Hindu soul between incarnations. </p> <p>There is plenty of local detail in these pages, brand names of foods and medications, but a vagueness about time. If one branch of the Irani hotel chain, where Mr Pathak goes to dip Gluco biscuits in his tea, is threatened with replacement by a video store, then the period can hardly be earlier than the 1980s, but the suppressed nostalgia of the tone would fit an earlier setting.</p> <p>The happiest relationship in the book is an arranged marriage, and even a headstrong girl planning to elope with an unsuitable boy finds herself drawn to the possibility of marrying, instead, a man she does not know. The city apartment building which houses all the characters, from the affluent widower in the penthouse to Man Who Sleeps On The Bottom Step, retains something of the feel of a village, where everyone knows everyone and no secret lasts long. Feuds can simmer for years; there are no lightbulbs on the landings any more, after a dispute about how the electricity bill should be divided. </p> <p>With the housewives Mrs Pathak and Mrs Asrani locked in rivalry over status - sharing a kitchen and stealing each other's supplies (one woman marking the level of ghee on the container with eyebrow pencil) - Suri enters familiar territory. Impressed despite herself by the Mexican-style 'tocos' [sic] - really only chapatis wrapped round cauliflower curry, served by the hostess at her last card party - Mrs Pathak sets out to trump them by making Russian-salad samosas, pouring in extra mayonnaise with a manic disregard for the expense. Despite such entertaining moments of broad comedy, it's hard to distinguish between the women, or between their symmetrically henpecked husbands. </p> <p>There's something distasteful, in any case, about a successful emigrant (Suri is a university professor of mathematics in Baltimore) dishing up caricatural portraits of the life he has left. There's nothing a privileged readership likes more than stories about the ridiculous poor (as long as they're exotic enough to trigger no unease); their antics and pretensions, their cowardice and inability to tell the truth. </p> <p>Suri has had short fiction published in the New Yorker; in this first novel, he shows some familiar difficulties in building a larger structure. He has the advantage, as far as plotting goes, that in this apartment block there are no unoccupied spaces, and everything converges on the stairs. At first it seems as though vignettes of apartment life will simply alternate with Vishnu's memories and visions, but gradually a more ambitious pattern emerges. Mr Jalal, an intellectual who has always mocked his wife's unthinking faith, finds himself drawn towards religious experience. He decides to share Vishnu's suffering, and to sleep next to him on the landing. There he has a vision of the odd-job man's godhead. Vishnu is a god, and it follows that Mr Jalal must be his prophet. </p> <p>What makes this awkward for him is that he is an undevout Muslim who has had a Hindu revelation. Convincing his Hindu neighbours will be uphill work, with martyrdom a distinct possibility. The other awkwardness of Mr Jalal's conversion (corroborated by Vishnu's experiences of his own divine self) is purely literary: it breaks the ground plan of comedy. Real religious experience can't be accommodated in this entertainingly stereotyped Bombay any more than bits of the Old Testament could be slotted into Mapp and Lucia. </p> <p>The new perspective does make possible some successful passages, as when Mr Jalal, in hospital, contemplates his surroundings: 'Wasn't medicine, ultimately, a matter of faith? Faith that the doctors knew what they were diagnosing, faith that their prescriptions would make you whole, faith that the tablet dissolving in your mouth would cure you, not kill you? Weren't entire hospitals built on faith?' There's even a certain fascination in how the book will end, but it's less to do with an interest in the fate of the characters than a curiosity about technique. Will Suri force the story into a tragic register once and for all, or will he still be grinding the genre gearbox in the book's last pages?</p>",

The city apartment building which houses all the characters, from the affluent widower in the penthouse to Man Who Sleeps On The Bottom Step, retains something of the feel of a village, where everyone knows everyone and no secret lasts long. Feuds can simmer for years; there are no lightbulbs on the landings any more, after a dispute about how the electricity bill should be divided. With the housewives Mrs Pathak and Mrs Asrani locked in rivalry over status - sharing a kitchen and stealing each other's supplies (one woman marking the level of ghee on the container with eyebrow pencil) - Suri enters familiar territory. Impressed despite herself by the Mexican-style 'tocos' [sic] - really only chapatis wrapped round cauliflower curry, served by the hostess at her last card party - Mrs Pathak sets out to trump them by making Russian-salad samosas, pouring in extra mayonnaise with a manic disregard for the expense. Despite such entertaining moments of broad comedy, it's hard to distinguish between the women, or between their symmetrically henpecked husbands. There's something distasteful, in any case, about a successful emigrant (Suri is a university professor of mathematics in Baltimore) dishing up caricatural portraits of the life he has left. There's nothing a privileged readership likes more than stories about the ridiculous poor (as long as they're exotic enough to trigger no unease); their antics and pretensions, their cowardice and inability to tell the truth. Suri has had short fiction published in the New Yorker; in this first novel, he shows some familiar difficulties in building a larger structure. He has the advantage, as far as plotting goes, that in this apartment block there are no unoccupied spaces, and everything converges on the stairs. At first it seems as though vignettes of apartment life will simply alternate with Vishnu's memories and visions, but gradually a more ambitious pattern emerges. Mr Jalal, an intellectual who has always mocked his wife's unthinking faith, finds himself drawn towards religious experience. He decides to share Vishnu's suffering, and to sleep next to him on the landing. There he has a vision of the odd-job man's godhead. Vishnu is a god, and it follows that Mr Jalal must be his prophet. What makes this awkward for him is that he is an undevout Muslim who has had a Hindu revelation. Convincing his Hindu neighbours will be uphill work, with martyrdom a distinct possibility. The other awkwardness of Mr Jalal's conversion (corroborated by Vishnu's experiences of his own divine self) is purely literary: it breaks the ground plan of comedy. Real religious experience can't be accommodated in this entertainingly stereotyped Bombay any more than bits of the Old Testament could be slotted into Mapp and Lucia. The new perspective does make possible some successful passages, as when Mr Jalal, in hospital, contemplates his surroundings: 'Wasn't medicine, ultimately, a matter of faith? Faith that the doctors knew what they were diagnosing, faith that their prescriptions would make you whole, faith that the tablet dissolving in your mouth would cure you, not kill you? Weren't entire hospitals built on faith?' There's even a certain fascination in how the book will end, but it's less to do with an interest in the fate of the characters than a curiosity about technique. Will Suri force the story into a tragic register once and for all, or will he still be grinding the genre gearbox in the book's last pages?",

It's a common belief that musicians are generally thoughtful people, spending, as they do, their professional lives within the rarefied abstractions of symphonic form. It's a notion, however, which would be quickly cured by a week on tour with an average symphony orchestra.</p> <p>Most musicians wouldn't pretend in any sense to be intellectual, or even curious about music, and the most celebrated virtuosi can be surprisingly ignorant about their art; trombonists who know everything there is to be known about mouthpieces, but couldn't give you the roughest account of sonata form; violinists who have never heard of Luigi Nono and regard Sarasate (if their programmes are any guide) as a towering genius; singers (it isn't unknown) who can't even read music. </p> <p>Alfred Brendel is quite an unusual figure, and this collection of his essays presents a pleasing and fascinating portrait of a first-rate mind which also happens to be a great pianist. Plenty of concert-goers will have had the experience of listening to a performer whose account of the Symphonic Etudes strikes them as not just virtuosic, but profoundly intelligent; if they had the opportunity of going backstage afterwards and talking to the performer, they would probably be dismayed to discover how very misleading such an impression can be. Plenty of the greatest virtuosi are not very far removed from idiots savants, feeling their way in the dark. </p> <p>Even people who don't much like music - even orchestral players who have the luck to accompany him in a concerto - concede the excellence of Alfred Brendel. Which, as Nancy Mitford would say, they can afford to since there's only one of him and he's getting on a bit. Hearing him work through the incomparable intellectual demands of a late Beethoven sonata, one always had that sense of a superb, playful intelligence in dialogue with genius. That, it turns out, was not the usual illusion, and reading his essays has exactly the effect of being taken backstage and listening to a master dissect his art. What he has to say comes from an unusual standpoint; a great performer and a penetrating analytical intelligence.</p> <p>There are other critics - Charles Rosen springs to mind - who are also accomplished concert pianists; there are some pianists, such as Glenn Gould, who have curious, eccentric insights in prose into the works they perform. There isn't another one, however, who is so equally interesting in prose or performance. Neither Brendel's essays nor his concerts need to acquire authority from other aspects of his work; they stand on their own merits. </p> <p>Brendel's career has been a matter of intense focus on a few favourite composers. He is obviously curious about all manner of music, and widely learned in the art - he is a familiar figure at the most recherch\u00e9 of London new music concerts.

      "bodyText": "On Music Alfred Brendel Robson \u00a316.99, pp432 Buy it at a discount at BOL Performing musicians needn't be intelligent, but it's nice when they are. It's a common belief that musicians are generally thoughtful people, spending, as they do, their professional lives within the rarefied abstractions of symphonic form. It's a notion, however, which would be quickly cured by a week on tour with an average symphony orchestra. Most musicians wouldn't pretend in any sense to be intellectual, or even curious about music, and the most celebrated virtuosi can be surprisingly ignorant about their art; trombonists who know everything there is to be known about mouthpieces, but couldn't give you the roughest account of sonata form; violinists who have never heard of Luigi Nono and regard Sarasate (if their programmes are any guide) as a towering genius; singers (it isn't unknown) who can't even read music. Alfred Brendel is quite an unusual figure, and this collection of his essays presents a pleasing and fascinating portrait of a first-rate mind which also happens to be a great pianist. Plenty of concert-goers will have had the experience of listening to a performer whose account of the Symphonic Etudes strikes them as not just virtuosic, but profoundly intelligent; if they had the opportunity of going backstage afterwards and talking to the performer, they would probably be dismayed to discover how very misleading such an impression can be. Plenty of the greatest virtuosi are not very far removed from idiots savants, feeling their way in the dark. Even people who don't much like music - even orchestral players who have the luck to accompany him in a concerto - concede the excellence of Alfred Brendel. Which, as Nancy Mitford would say, they can afford to since there's only one of him and he's getting on a bit. Hearing him work through the incomparable intellectual demands of a late Beethoven sonata, one always had that sense of a superb, playful intelligence in dialogue with genius. That, it turns out, was not the usual illusion, and reading his essays has exactly the effect of being taken backstage and listening to a master dissect his art. What he has to say comes from an unusual standpoint; a great performer and a penetrating analytical intelligence. There are other critics - Charles Rosen springs to mind - who are also accomplished concert pianists; there are some pianists, such as Glenn Gould, who have curious, eccentric insights in prose into the works they perform. There isn't another one, however, who is so equally interesting in prose or performance. Neither Brendel's essays nor his concerts need to acquire authority from other aspects of his work; they stand on their own merits. Brendel's career has been a matter of intense focus on a few favourite composers. He is obviously curious about all manner of music, and widely learned in the art - he is a familiar figure at the most recherch\u00e9 of London new music concerts. But his interests always return to half a dozen figures from the great Austro-German tradition, and it's these that the essays focus on. Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt, Busoni and Schoenberg are here as obviously central to the art of music as they ever were; more marginal figures interest Brendel in exactly that way, marginally. Chopin and Debussy, great as they are, are not at the heart of Brendel's imaginative project, and though he is capable of great sensuality, he prefers to find it buried within the architectural forms of a Mozart slow movement or a Busoni elegy.

The biggest surprise in his new novel, <strong> A Painted House</strong>, is that it isn't a legal thriller. In fact, it isn't really a thriller at all. Instead, Grisham has been inspired by memories of his childhood in rural Arkansas to write a thoughtful, nostalgic story about the dramas surrounding the cotton harvest of 1952 and a hard-working, impoverished farming family. </p> <p>You can take the adventure out of Grisham, but you can't take Grisham out of his adventures, and he has lost none of his storytelling skills. So there are dramas aplenty as the family are joined by migrant Mexicans and a family of 'hill people' to harvest their 80-acre crop. There are powerful set-piece scenes - bare-knuckle fights, fairground wrestling matches, baseball games, typhoons and floods. And there are two murders, although Grisham deliberately avoids making their solution the focus of the story. </p> <p>The narrator is a seven-year-old boy, a device that doesn't always come off, but it means that because of his ignorance and innocence, the story is heavy with secrets. In its nostalgic evocation of times past it's redolent of Norris Church Mailer's crime novel that isn't, Windchill Summer. This is an absorbing, quietly impressive read. </p> <p>Michael Connelly is one of the big-hitters of US mystery fiction, a multi-award winner whose most recent novels - Blood Work, Angels Flight and Void Moon - have all topped the bestseller charts. His prose is vivid and direct and he obviously researches thoroughly - court and crime scenes, police and FBI procedures, the psychology of murderers and their pursuers all have the tang of authenticity. <strong> A Darkness More Than Night</strong> has an intriguing premise: the bringing together of the protagonist of Blood Works, former FBI agent and psychological profiler, Terry McCaleb, with Harry 'Hieronymus' Bosch, the LAPD homicide detective who is the central character in Angels Flight and five earlier novels. </p> <p>They come together because of a grotesque murder that baffles the LAPD. McCaleb, taking it easy in retirement on Catalina Island with his new wife and daughter and a bad heart condition, is asked to profile the murderer. The twist, revealed in the cover blurb so I'm giving nothing away, is that the profile he establishes is a perfect fit for Harry Bosch. </p> <p>The result is a highly proficient, confidently written thriller, particularly good on the conflict McCaleb has between the new, peaceful life he has established with his wife in enforced retirement and the adrenaline rush he feels on his return to the work on which he thrives.

The biggest surprise in his new novel, A Painted House, is that it isn't a legal thriller. In fact, it isn't really a thriller at all. Instead, Grisham has been inspired by memories of his childhood in rural Arkansas to write a thoughtful, nostalgic story about the dramas surrounding the cotton harvest of 1952 and a hard-working, impoverished farming family. You can take the adventure out of Grisham, but you can't take Grisham out of his adventures, and he has lost none of his storytelling skills. So there are dramas aplenty as the family are joined by migrant Mexicans and a family of 'hill people' to harvest their 80-acre crop. There are powerful set-piece scenes - bare-knuckle fights, fairground wrestling matches, baseball games, typhoons and floods. And there are two murders, although Grisham deliberately avoids making their solution the focus of the story. The narrator is a seven-year-old boy, a device that doesn't always come off, but it means that because of his ignorance and innocence, the story is heavy with secrets. In its nostalgic evocation of times past it's redolent of Norris Church Mailer's crime novel that isn't, Windchill Summer. This is an absorbing, quietly impressive read. Michael Connelly is one of the big-hitters of US mystery fiction, a multi-award winner whose most recent novels - Blood Work, Angels Flight and Void Moon - have all topped the bestseller charts. His prose is vivid and direct and he obviously researches thoroughly - court and crime scenes, police and FBI procedures, the psychology of murderers and their pursuers all have the tang of authenticity. A Darkness More Than Night has an intriguing premise: the bringing together of the protagonist of Blood Works, former FBI agent and psychological profiler, Terry McCaleb, with Harry 'Hieronymus' Bosch, the LAPD homicide detective who is the central character in Angels Flight and five earlier novels. They come together because of a grotesque murder that baffles the LAPD. McCaleb, taking it easy in retirement on Catalina Island with his new wife and daughter and a bad heart condition, is asked to profile the murderer. The twist, revealed in the cover blurb so I'm giving nothing away, is that the profile he establishes is a perfect fit for Harry Bosch. The result is a highly proficient, confidently written thriller, particularly good on the conflict McCaleb has between the new, peaceful life he has established with his wife in enforced retirement and the adrenaline rush he feels on his return to the work on which he thrives. How tense you find the novel, however, depends on how seriously you can take the notion that Connelly's regular series character, Harry Bosch, could cross the line and embrace the darkness he formerly fought against.

      "body": "<p>Tim Delaney's typical working day begins at 8.15 in the morning and ends at 9pm. As head of the London advertising agency Leagas Delaney, he frequently expects to put in extra hours on Sunday morning if there is work to be done. And as if that were not enough, much of Saturday is taken up with his other job, as a director of fast-rising football club Fulham, although he concedes that this is largely enjoyment. </p> <p>Delaney is, by most people's definition, a 'workaholic'. He has always worked hard - in childhood he had a paper round, a milk round and other assorted jobs. He says that his long hours are driven by a desire 'to get the work done, to do the right thing, and not to let people down', as well as perfectionism. 'When you are writing an ad,' he points out, 'you can always make it better.' </p> <p>He also expects the people who work for him to put in long hours. 'If someone left the office at 5.30 each day and the results were fabulous, then I'd say OK,' he says. 'But in this business there are so many opportunities to be seized that it's unlikely that anybody would be justified in doing that.' </p> <p>He feels no compunction about asking his staff to work weekends, and says that although they might feel occasional resentment, they respect him. 'Everyone wants their general to be leading them by example. What they don't want is somebody who tells them: you do this, I'm going out to dinner.' </p> <p>Delaney may be an exceptional taskmaster, and advertising a demanding business, but the evidence in recent years indicates that people in the UK are working increasingly long hours. Ten per cent of the population or more could be regarded as 'workaholics' by virtue of the hours they put in. </p> <p>But what is it like to work for someone like that? Is it inspiring, or is it just stressful? The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) has just carried out some research into the subject which appears to show that, for most people, having a workaholic boss is regarded far more positively than might be expected, although there is a clear danger that you will feel under pressure to work longer hours yourself. </p> <p>An earlier piece of research by the CIPD, published last December, showed that the introduction of the Working Time Directive has done little to stop people working long hours. The CIPD's new report, Married to the Job?, looked at how other workers perceived workaholics. Some 38 per cent surveyed said their bosses worked more than 48 hours a week; 28 per cent described that person as a 'workaholic'. But 70 per cent of this latter group regarded the boss in question as a 'good example' and only 3 per cent said they resented the long hours he or she worked. </p> <p>Melissa Compton-Edwards, the report's author, says the research showed that many people are inspired by a boss who works long hours, but it also demonstrated a downside: nearly a third said their workaholic boss would sometimes pressurise or bully them when he or she couldn't cope, and a quarter of those who had a workaholic colleague said they ended up working longer hours themselves in order to avoid looking lazy. </p> <p>Compton-Edwards says: 'I think this demonstrates that there is still a very strong work ethic in this country. People feel a lot of respect for those who are seen to be pulling their weight. But a lot depends on the attitude of the workaholic. If you choose to work long hours, you should be careful as a manager to make it explicitly clear to those who work for you that they don't have to work all hours to keep up with you.' </p> <p>And to those with workaholic bosses? 'Don't feel pressured,' she says. 'Don't take part in the macho \"lunch is for wimps\" culture. You should be judged on what you do, not the hours you put in.' </p> <p>One entrepreneur who has taken a stand against long hours is Jacqueline de Baer, who runs a London-based corporate clothing company called De Baer with 70 employees and a \u00a39 million turnover. She works a regular 9am to 6pm day and encourages her staff to do the same. De Baer believes that it is possible to reduce time in the office by working more efficiently, but that it is also a matter of priorities. 'A lot of people spend long hours at work because they haven't decided that rest is important,' she says. </p> <p>But Roger Spiller, national secretary for health, safety and the environment at the MSF trade union, says that although pressure to work long hours can come from a workaholic boss, it is too often part of the company culture. 'If it's pressure that's institutionalised, then you really have to change the institution, because the individual can't resist in those circumstances,' he argues. </p>",

'If someone left the office at 5.30 each day and the results were fabulous, then I'd say OK,' he says. 'But in this business there are so many opportunities to be seized that it's unlikely that anybody would be justified in doing that.' He feels no compunction about asking his staff to work weekends, and says that although they might feel occasional resentment, they respect him. 'Everyone wants their general to be leading them by example. What they don't want is somebody who tells them: you do this, I'm going out to dinner.' Delaney may be an exceptional taskmaster, and advertising a demanding business, but the evidence in recent years indicates that people in the UK are working increasingly long hours. Ten per cent of the population or more could be regarded as 'workaholics' by virtue of the hours they put in. But what is it like to work for someone like that? Is it inspiring, or is it just stressful? The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) has just carried out some research into the subject which appears to show that, for most people, having a workaholic boss is regarded far more positively than might be expected, although there is a clear danger that you will feel under pressure to work longer hours yourself. An earlier piece of research by the CIPD, published last December, showed that the introduction of the Working Time Directive has done little to stop people working long hours. The CIPD's new report, Married to the Job?, looked at how other workers perceived workaholics. Some 38 per cent surveyed said their bosses worked more than 48 hours a week; 28 per cent described that person as a 'workaholic'. But 70 per cent of this latter group regarded the boss in question as a 'good example' and only 3 per cent said they resented the long hours he or she worked. Melissa Compton-Edwards, the report's author, says the research showed that many people are inspired by a boss who works long hours, but it also demonstrated a downside: nearly a third said their workaholic boss would sometimes pressurise or bully them when he or she couldn't cope, and a quarter of those who had a workaholic colleague said they ended up working longer hours themselves in order to avoid looking lazy. Compton-Edwards says: 'I think this demonstrates that there is still a very strong work ethic in this country. People feel a lot of respect for those who are seen to be pulling their weight. But a lot depends on the attitude of the workaholic. If you choose to work long hours, you should be careful as a manager to make it explicitly clear to those who work for you that they don't have to work all hours to keep up with you.' And to those with workaholic bosses? 'Don't feel pressured,' she says. 'Don't take part in the macho \"lunch is for wimps\" culture. You should be judged on what you do, not the hours you put in.' One entrepreneur who has taken a stand against long hours is Jacqueline de Baer, who runs a London-based corporate clothing company called De Baer with 70 employees and a \u00a39 million turnover. She works a regular 9am to 6pm day and encourages her staff to do the same. De Baer believes that it is possible to reduce time in the office by working more efficiently, but that it is also a matter of priorities. 'A lot of people spend long hours at work because they haven't decided that rest is important,' she says. But Roger Spiller, national secretary for health, safety and the environment at the MSF trade union, says that although pressure to work long hours can come from a workaholic boss, it is too often part of the company culture. 'If it's pressure that's institutionalised, then you really have to change the institution, because the individual can't resist in those circumstances,' he argues.",
