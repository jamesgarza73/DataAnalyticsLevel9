      "bodyText": "\u0095 Weaponry The \"reliability, robustness and 'suppressive capability\"' of the light support weapon used in Kosovo was considered \"insufficient\", said Lt-Col Gibson's report. At night, troops worked more slowly than desired because they were not all equipped with night vision devices. \u0095 Communications Battle communications were a \"hindrance to operations\". Radio operators resorted to using code words and \"nick numbers\" to disguise sensitive security details because their broadcasts could be overheard by anyone with the right equipment. The Clansman radio equipment is \"old and unreliable\" with up to 35% of the units being repaired at any one time. The communications problems were made subject of an urgent request for a secure replacement system, but the equipment was \"not made available to the BG (battle group) before it left theatre,\" says Lt-Col Gibson's report. Brig Freer added that the communications situation was \"unworkable\" for \"anything other than a totally benign environment\". On ground-to-air communications, he wrote: \"We were fortunate that an inadequate system was not put to the test.\" \u0095 Intelligence Tactical intelligence available to the battle groups during the operation in Kosovo was \"disappointing\", according to the leaked reports. \"Considerable intelligence products were available to Nato but these were not disseminated to BG (battle group) level,\" they say. \"In particular, imagery obtained during the air campaign was over classified and consequently not released to BGs.\" They were also denied access to officers with local knowledge, such as those who had served on earlier Nato stints in Kosovo. \u0095 Families A lack of communication meant the families of serving personnel heard deployment details through the media rather than through official sources. Families found out about the initial deployment from the BBC 24 to 36 hours before soldiers had the decision confirmed by their chain of command. \u0095 Equipment A lack of equipment led to soldiers sleeping on floors and rarely being able to take a shower during deployment in Pristina. Many troops purchased their own solar shower bags and camp beds \"to improve their living conditions\", said the leaked reports. Members of the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment bought their own global positioning satellite receivers because there were not enough to go around. There was also a shortage of other items of equipment, such as \"plasticuffs\" for use in public order situations. \u0095 Spin-doctoring One of the reports seems to suggest that \"spin-doctoring\" of the Kosovo campaign by the ministry of defence led to a lot of time being wasted. Lt-Col Gibson wrote that while most media coverage was supportive, \"on the few occasions when adverse articles might have been written, there seemed to be concern and subsequently disproportionate command and staff effort expended over the potential implications of such articles. \"This may be a product of MOD 'spin-doctoring'. \"Commanders and staff need to be much more positive in the face of the media.\" Lt-Col Gibson advocated full co-operation with the media and said \"black-listing\" of news organisations who were not supportive \"denied them access to stories and was an effective solution\". \"Soldiers dealing within the BG were continually briefed on the pitfalls when dealing with the press. Experience suggested that journalists are usually delighted to be spoon-fed with direction, advice and, on occasions, copy.\" \u0095 Command A delay in dividing responsibilities between the national forces and K-For \"meant that soldiers were initially operating in something of a vacuum which lasted for several days\", said the reports. The chain of command left much to be desired. Brigadier Freer commented: \"A clear chain of command is a basic principle of military operations and the blurred lines which existed only served to cause confusion.\" The \"confused and fractured\" lines of command \"may have had a damaging effect on morale\", adds the report. The situation eroded troops' confidence in the chain of command and had the potential to place individual soldiers in \"an invidious position\". \u0095 Legal powers Soldiers in Operation Agricola were not made aware of their legal powers before being deployed in Pristina, says one of the reports. It paints a picture of a confused and legally toothless military force. The report adds: \"Appropriate advice was slow to arrive. Advice often dodged the issue referring the matter back to the judgment of the soldier on the ground. \"There was much discussion about law and legal procedures but little application of justice. There seemed to be a great fear of both adverse publicity and the possibility of future litigation. Suspected war criminals could only be detained for a few hours before they had to be released.\" Lt-Col Gibson added that the Albanian community, in particular, meted out violence on Serbs \"sure in the knowledge that the BG (battle group) was impotent to do anything to stop them\".",

      "bodyText": "Judging by the chaos at the Maracana, the builders believe Manchester United kick off there not in two days but in two months. Forget the heat, Sir Alex Ferguson's team should consider playing their World Club Championship opener in hard hats. Less than 72 hours before United take on Necaxa of Mexico, and less than 11 days before it hosts the final, the Maracana is a building site. Seats are missing, drills are whirring, paint is being hastily slapped on. Work began almost two months ago and is going on round the clock. No fewer than 500 people are trying to transform this crumbling concrete monster into a palace fit for the king of Fifa, Sepp Blatter, by Thursday night. \"It will be fully finished,\" a spokesman insisted. For the first time since it was built half a century ago, the Maracana will be an all-seat stadium; Fifa demands as much. United's 400 travelling fans will not be segregated. An estimated 205,000 people watched the decisive World Cup game there between Brazil and Uruguay in 1950.

Bill Kenwright's entrance was marked by the five-goal destruction of Sunderland but Leicester made sure this was a much more prosaic performance from Everton in front of the watching impresario and owner-in-waiting. At least they preserved their unbeaten home record in the Premiership this season with an improved second half team display that earned the reward of a penalty equaliser from David Unsworth and a point to make it six matches without defeat. However, it was a point that looked unlikely for 20 minutes for half-time as Leicester, typically, made two route one attacks count through the considerable strength in the air of Matt Elliott. Leicester manager Martin O'Neill has constantly complained about a paper-thin squad and a long injury list but, in fact, it proved to be the main threat as his side ended a run of four Premiership defeats. Defender Elliott was pushed into an emergency role alongside Tony Cottee because of the injuries and the suspension to Emile Heskey, and the captain created all the damage. Indeed, Leicester's injury problems worsened in the sixth minute when keeper Tim Flowers was carried off on a stretcher - and taken to hospital with knee ligament trouble - after a collision with Nick Barmby, and replaced by Pegguy Arphexad. And it was the Frenchman whose long-range combination with Elliott produced Leicester's two first half goals after they fell behind in the 16th minute, when a 25-yard drive by David Weir hit Don Hutchison to end up in the back of the net, with the goal likely to be credited to the midfielder. Then the long-range one-two between the Leicester keeper and Elliott stunned the Everton crown in the 25th minute. Arphexad's long clearance was headed on by the Scottish international and he continued his run to pick up a ball from Theo Zagorakis and drill the equaliser passed Paul Gerrard. Weir missed the target badly from 15-yards a minute earlier for Everton and the error was punished severely again in the 32nd minute with Elliott featuring as maker and taker. Another long ball from Arphexah was headed on by Elliott and Cottee's nagging presence prompted a mix up between Dave Watson and Gerrard. Again Elliott profited with a goal. Everton went into shell after Leicester's equaliser but were handed a lifeline in the 57th minute when Frank Sinclair handled in the box and Unsworth stepped up to equalise from the spot. Everton honoured their 10 selected greatest players from the last century but manager Walter Smith acknowledged their performance did not match the memory of names like Dave Hickson, Alex Young and Howard Kendall. \"We didn't play well enough to claim that we should have won and we're all disappointed we didn't produce the level of performance we have in previous home matches,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>A graphic account of how John Major's government was gripped by panic over Princess Diana's uncompromising stance on a worldwide ban on landmines is revealed in previously secret diplomatic cables.</p> <p>They were sent by American ambassadors to the US secretary of state, Madeline Albright, during the princess's visit to Angola. They reveal that the Americans believed Diana had 'bested' John Major and the foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, after a junior defence minister, Earl Howe, had accused her of being a 'loose cannon'.</p> <p>They also contain a revealing insight into how she refused to 'wine and dine' the social elite and snubbed the daughter of an African king in favour of meeting the Angolan people. Such attitudes caused considerable embarrassment for the British ambassador in Angola, Roger Hart, who had to sneak in VIP guests to eat char sui and bean sprouts with the princess.</p> <p>The trip, in January 1997, caused huge controversy in the press when she appeared to endorse Labour's policy of a worldwide ban on landmines. The US cables show that the Americans - who later cooled on the idea of a ban - could scarcely conceal their delight at her strong stance and even told the British ambassador in Angola what a great success her visit had been.</p> <p>Blow-by-blow accounts of the princess's controversial visit were sent to Ms Albright from Admiral William Crowe, then US ambassador to Britain, and Donald Steinberg, then US ambassador to Angola. The cables released to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act would be banned from publication in Britain until 2072 because of their mention of the royal family. Admiral Crowe's cable - written in the same colourful language as his outspoken comments about the royals and William Hague after Diana's death - is headed 'Princess Di trips political landmine'. 'Controversy and/or room for misunderstanding was inherent in the princess's trip' because the British Red Cross wanted an immediate worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines, while the government's position was that Britain would not support a ban until all countries had signed a deal. Once the princess had made her statement supporting a worldwide ban, she was attacked by Earl Howe for being 'ill-informed on the issue of anti-personnel mines' and a 'loose cannon' ' that Her Majesty's government did not need'.</p> <p>Admiral Crowe says: 'Government officials immediately scrambled to repair the public relations damage and issued statements affirming the government's commitment to 'working toward a worldwide ban on landmines'.' A Downing Street spokesman was quoted as claiming there had been a 'misunderstanding' and that the princess's remarks were not 'inconsistent with government policy'. He adds: 'Labour party officials used the flap to highlight differences between Labour and the Conservative government on the landmine issue.'</p> <p>Mr Steinberg tells Ms Albright from Luanda that by the time the three-day trip had finished the princess had 'bested a political furore in London', adding that Mr Major and Mr Rifkind had 'stepped in to cool things off'. He also reports approvingly of how she shunned celebrity status. 'She wanted a serious visit, not to be seen wining and dining with the social elite. The daughter of the king of the Lundas wanted to meet with her British counterpart, but failed. The princess accepted a dinner invitation hosted by first lady Ana Paula Dos Santos (the Angolan president's wife) on condition that it be small (26 guests ate from a catered Chinese food buffet) short (it ended at 8.10pm) and there be no press or speeches. Hart (the British ambassador) managed to get the local directors of Shell, BP and De Beers invited. 'Hart himself held only a dinner for her and Red Cross officials.'</p> <p>The reports also discloses that Mr Major's government had the added problem that Diana had been fully briefed of the British position by the foreign office and the visit had been personally approved by the Queen. 'For her part, the princess was looking for a new public cause to promote that would not conflict with the interests of other members of the royal family.'</p> <p>The US ambassador's report adds that originally the Red Cross wanted to send her to Vietnam or Cambodia but this was ruled out by the foreign office as too dangerous. Mr Steinberg concludes: 'She was excited about the results and talking about more visits to Vietnam, Cambodia, Kuwait and return engagement in Angola. No one can come to Angola and see the human devastation caused by landmines and not be moved. We have told the British ambassador how seriously the United States' government takes this problem and how much we appreciate Diana's support.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "A graphic account of how John Major's government was gripped by panic over Princess Diana's uncompromising stance on a worldwide ban on landmines is revealed in previously secret diplomatic cables. They were sent by American ambassadors to the US secretary of state, Madeline Albright, during the princess's visit to Angola. They reveal that the Americans believed Diana had 'bested' John Major and the foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, after a junior defence minister, Earl Howe, had accused her of being a 'loose cannon'. They also contain a revealing insight into how she refused to 'wine and dine' the social elite and snubbed the daughter of an African king in favour of meeting the Angolan people. Such attitudes caused considerable embarrassment for the British ambassador in Angola, Roger Hart, who had to sneak in VIP guests to eat char sui and bean sprouts with the princess. The trip, in January 1997, caused huge controversy in the press when she appeared to endorse Labour's policy of a worldwide ban on landmines. The US cables show that the Americans - who later cooled on the idea of a ban - could scarcely conceal their delight at her strong stance and even told the British ambassador in Angola what a great success her visit had been. Blow-by-blow accounts of the princess's controversial visit were sent to Ms Albright from Admiral William Crowe, then US ambassador to Britain, and Donald Steinberg, then US ambassador to Angola. The cables released to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act would be banned from publication in Britain until 2072 because of their mention of the royal family. Admiral Crowe's cable - written in the same colourful language as his outspoken comments about the royals and William Hague after Diana's death - is headed 'Princess Di trips political landmine'. 'Controversy and/or room for misunderstanding was inherent in the princess's trip' because the British Red Cross wanted an immediate worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines, while the government's position was that Britain would not support a ban until all countries had signed a deal. Once the princess had made her statement supporting a worldwide ban, she was attacked by Earl Howe for being 'ill-informed on the issue of anti-personnel mines' and a 'loose cannon' ' that Her Majesty's government did not need'. Admiral Crowe says: 'Government officials immediately scrambled to repair the public relations damage and issued statements affirming the government's commitment to 'working toward a worldwide ban on landmines'.' A Downing Street spokesman was quoted as claiming there had been a 'misunderstanding' and that the princess's remarks were not 'inconsistent with government policy'. He adds: 'Labour party officials used the flap to highlight differences between Labour and the Conservative government on the landmine issue.' Mr Steinberg tells Ms Albright from Luanda that by the time the three-day trip had finished the princess had 'bested a political furore in London', adding that Mr Major and Mr Rifkind had 'stepped in to cool things off'. He also reports approvingly of how she shunned celebrity status. 'She wanted a serious visit, not to be seen wining and dining with the social elite. The daughter of the king of the Lundas wanted to meet with her British counterpart, but failed. The princess accepted a dinner invitation hosted by first lady Ana Paula Dos Santos (the Angolan president's wife) on condition that it be small (26 guests ate from a catered Chinese food buffet) short (it ended at 8.10pm) and there be no press or speeches. Hart (the British ambassador) managed to get the local directors of Shell, BP and De Beers invited. 'Hart himself held only a dinner for her and Red Cross officials.' The reports also discloses that Mr Major's government had the added problem that Diana had been fully briefed of the British position by the foreign office and the visit had been personally approved by the Queen. 'For her part, the princess was looking for a new public cause to promote that would not conflict with the interests of other members of the royal family.' The US ambassador's report adds that originally the Red Cross wanted to send her to Vietnam or Cambodia but this was ruled out by the foreign office as too dangerous. Mr Steinberg concludes: 'She was excited about the results and talking about more visits to Vietnam, Cambodia, Kuwait and return engagement in Angola. No one can come to Angola and see the human devastation caused by landmines and not be moved. We have told the British ambassador how seriously the United States' government takes this problem and how much we appreciate Diana's support.'",

      "bodyText": "Russia's centre-left opposition has been plunged into disarray by Boris Yeltsin's snap resignation designed to boost the presidential prospects of his protege, Vladimir Putin. Reeling from the New Year's Eve coup, the opposition appears at a loss about how to mount a credible challenge to the acting president and prime minister. The presidential election is expected on March 26 - three months earlier than scheduled. And the campaign effectively kicked off on New Year's Day, with Mr Putin shown live on state television during a morale-boosting visit to Russian troops in Chechnya. 'Russia thanks you,' he told Russian officers and soldiers. Already the darling of the military because of his hard line on Chechnya, Mr Putin burnished his army credentials further by telling the top brass and the country that the military and not the politicians would decide on the pace and conduct of the war. However, Mr Putin faces three declared candidates in the race for the Kremlin: Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime minister and foreign minister, Grigory Yavlinsky, the liberals' leader, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme nationalist. It is also assumed that Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist party's leader who lost to Mr Yeltsin in 1996, will also stand. The first three all declared their candidatures just before the elections to the duma two weeks ago in an attempt to enhance their vote. But only the Communist vote stood up, although they are 35 seats worse off in the new parlia ment, which is dominated by centrists and promises far greater support for Mr Putin than Mr Yeltsin ever enjoyed. Can Mr Putin be stopped? Mr Yavlinsky's candidacy can be effectively discounted, and Mr Putin's main opposition will come from the centre-left, the Communists and the Fatherland-All Russia movement (OVR) of Mr Primakov and the Moscow mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. The former Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, responded to the Yeltsin resignation by urging the centre-left to unite behind a single candidate, Mr Primakov, to maximise the vote against Mr Putin. The Communists are the best organised and most disciplined party machine in Russia and could probably guarantee Mr Primakov a quarter of the electorate. But that would entail Mr Zyuganov eating humble pie and standing aside. But despite Mr Primakov's declared candidacy two weeks ago, it is no longer clear if he will run. Mr Luzhkov declined to endorse Mr Primakov last Friday, saying there would need to be 'consultations'. Moreover, the number three in the OVR, Vladimir Yakovlev, the mayor of Russia's second city, St Petersburg, faces re-election in May and is already flirting with the Putin camp. Gennady Seleznev, the Communist speaker of the outgoing duma says frankly that Mr Putin looks unbeatable. The interim president has returned the compliment by voicing support for the Communist in his bid to be governor of the greater Moscow region. In short, while the opposition fractures in the face of the Putin phenomenon, the acting president and prime minister is busy building a broader support base - ambitious politicians of all stripes are suddenly eager to bask in his glory. State television propaganda has been hugely instrumental in building up Mr Putin and in securing the strong showing of his allies in the duma election. The next three months will see a continuation of that campaign. And if Mr Primakov, 70, confirms his candidacy, he will be painted as an elderly, unreconstructed communist by state television.

      "body": "<p>At the end of the film When We Were Kings, Norman Mailer recalls that his last meeting with Muhammad Ali was at an Esquire party in New York. As we left the cinema my friend Al recalled the line and said: 'What would you say these days? The last time I saw Jamie Theakston, he was at an Esquire party... '</p> <p>And that is why the job of Esquire editor must be fraught with gloom. Every time you step into your office you are made aware of the huge weight of publishing history resting on your shoulders. The ghost of 1960s US Esquire must sit in the corner, sniffing haughtily as you bung yet another Caprice shoot on the cover and in your heart you must know it will shake its head at almost everything you do. Because, quite simply, 1960s US Esquire was the greatest magazine in the world. Now, Peter Howarth the present editor, says he wants to rediscover that magic.</p> <p>He has a lot to live up to. Which other magazine could claim to have created a new form of journalism and discovered Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer? Which other magazine could boast writers such as Truman Capote, Vladimir Nabokov, Allen Ginsberg and Edward Albee, and yet be confident enough to attack Capote on its own front page? Esquire was the first mainstream US magazine to take an anti-Vietnam war stance. It campaigned for Muhammad Ali's right to fight. It supported actors such as Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman. It was vilified by Nixon and praised by Warhol and managed to disregard them both.</p> <p>In large part, its place in history was guaranteed by its covers. In 1962, editor Harold Hayes abandoned the idea of using the in-house art department to create his cover and turned to a Madison Avenue advertising executive called George Lois. Lois wanted to create powerful images that sold the magazine without reference to the tedious list of features - 'burn off your belly!', '1,000 ways to be wicked!', 'this year's Bond girl - as you've never seen her before!' - that dominate men's magazine covers these days.</p> <p>It was Lois who persuaded Ali to pose like St Sebastian and who dared to put out an all-black cover with the phrase 'Oh my God - we hit a little girl' on the issue that carried the true story of M Company in Vietnam. It was also Lois who was mainly responsible for the way Esquire's UK editor Peter Howarth felt three months ago when looking at yet another bikini blonde on his cover.</p> <p>'I was ashamed,' he says. 'My wife looked at the cover I'd brought home and I felt embarrassed. Around the same time, a friend of mine who runs a bar round the corner told me that he can't leave copies of Esquire out when his friends come round because of the cover. In that issue we had a feature from the only journalist to train with the All Blacks and I was sitting at Twickenham with our deputy managing director and wondered how many people here would have known we had that kind of feature. I figured probably none of them.'</p> <p>Howarth was so ashamed that he did something about it. He decided to redesign his magazine, abandoning his 'girl in pants' cover policy completely and replacing it with a head and shoulders shot of the month's cover star. He decided to put his cover lines on a removable strip which can be thrown away once the magazine has been bought, leaving a pure image of the woman or - much more significantly - the man that Esquire has chosen this month. Because Howarth has also decided to abandon the recently accepted market wisdom that it's only chicks on the cover who sell, and that's why this month's Esquire cover star - on sale next week - is Johnny Depp.</p> <p>'We have this heritage that we publish good writing and great art and that had been lost,' he explains. 'I mean, it's all very well publishing John Updike in the 60s, but we've got some great writers now. We publish people like Martin Amis but we also use the Alex Ferguson principle of playing Eric Cantona alongside Ryan Giggs. That's why we also use new names such as Giles Foden and Matt Seaton, or James Parker or a TV documentary maker called Eamonn O'Neil who does all our investigative stuff.</p> <p>'People like that are exciting. They are the new Tom Wolfes. British Esquire should be about finding the new New Journalism. It's just that our covers didn't suggest that you were holding that sort of magazine in your hands. If we were the only men's magazine in the market, like Arena was in 1985, you could put whatever you wanted on the cover. But we're not. The ones that sell the most are the ones with the most childish content and the most girls with the least clothes. Our covers suggested we were like them and put off the sort of reader we wanted to attract.'</p> <p>And yet, surely something that is accepted market wisdom is usually accepted for a reason. Loaded recently put Dennis Hopper on the cover and saw its circulation instantly dip by about 50,000. The IPC board panicked and a missive shot down to Loaded's offices asking them to redress the situation sharpish. Isn't Howarth's plucky stance merely the doomed effort of a worthy editor to buck the inevitable? Won't he be on the phone to Caprice's agent by April?</p> <p>'The board has given me a year,' he says. 'Well, they've given me forever, but I have said to them that you can't judge this in any less time than a year and they backed me, which was very brave of them. The intention is not to lose circulation, and I think that's achievable.</p> <p>'I should say that this doesn't mean we're abandoning having women in the magazine. This is not a moral crusade. Even Harold Hayes had shoots with Raquel Welch and Angie Dickinson alongside pieces by Wolfe and Mailer. If we were to go down [in circulation], however, then it becomes interesting. Our advertisers are the kind of people who buy predominately on environment. Prada doesn't buy numbers or it would be advertising in FHM. But it isn't.</p> <p>'The question is, when do the numbers stop making sense? Given the momentum of the title over the last eight months, I'm convinced our readers will stay with us and we can keep selling over 100,000.'</p> <p>He's already dipped his toe into the water with the international edition of the magazine's last issue. In the UK the cover star was model Kate Groombridge, who sat naked against a white background. Overseas the cover star was Damon Albarn, that issue's big interview. Already, the overseas change has produced results. Both Prada and Hugo Boss, Howarth says, have welcomed the move and hope Esquire will move even further towards its 60s character. The big question, of course, is how the UK reader will react. Do any liberal British men reading this feel prompted to go out and buy Esquire? Over to you.</p>",

As we left the cinema my friend Al recalled the line and said: 'What would you say these days? The last time I saw Jamie Theakston, he was at an Esquire party... ' And that is why the job of Esquire editor must be fraught with gloom. Every time you step into your office you are made aware of the huge weight of publishing history resting on your shoulders. The ghost of 1960s US Esquire must sit in the corner, sniffing haughtily as you bung yet another Caprice shoot on the cover and in your heart you must know it will shake its head at almost everything you do. Because, quite simply, 1960s US Esquire was the greatest magazine in the world. Now, Peter Howarth the present editor, says he wants to rediscover that magic. He has a lot to live up to. Which other magazine could claim to have created a new form of journalism and discovered Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer? Which other magazine could boast writers such as Truman Capote, Vladimir Nabokov, Allen Ginsberg and Edward Albee, and yet be confident enough to attack Capote on its own front page? Esquire was the first mainstream US magazine to take an anti-Vietnam war stance. It campaigned for Muhammad Ali's right to fight. It supported actors such as Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman. It was vilified by Nixon and praised by Warhol and managed to disregard them both. In large part, its place in history was guaranteed by its covers. In 1962, editor Harold Hayes abandoned the idea of using the in-house art department to create his cover and turned to a Madison Avenue advertising executive called George Lois. Lois wanted to create powerful images that sold the magazine without reference to the tedious list of features - 'burn off your belly!', '1,000 ways to be wicked!', 'this year's Bond girl - as you've never seen her before!' - that dominate men's magazine covers these days. It was Lois who persuaded Ali to pose like St Sebastian and who dared to put out an all-black cover with the phrase 'Oh my God - we hit a little girl' on the issue that carried the true story of M Company in Vietnam. It was also Lois who was mainly responsible for the way Esquire's UK editor Peter Howarth felt three months ago when looking at yet another bikini blonde on his cover. 'I was ashamed,' he says. 'My wife looked at the cover I'd brought home and I felt embarrassed. Around the same time, a friend of mine who runs a bar round the corner told me that he can't leave copies of Esquire out when his friends come round because of the cover. In that issue we had a feature from the only journalist to train with the All Blacks and I was sitting at Twickenham with our deputy managing director and wondered how many people here would have known we had that kind of feature. I figured probably none of them.' Howarth was so ashamed that he did something about it. He decided to redesign his magazine, abandoning his 'girl in pants' cover policy completely and replacing it with a head and shoulders shot of the month's cover star. He decided to put his cover lines on a removable strip which can be thrown away once the magazine has been bought, leaving a pure image of the woman or - much more significantly - the man that Esquire has chosen this month. Because Howarth has also decided to abandon the recently accepted market wisdom that it's only chicks on the cover who sell, and that's why this month's Esquire cover star - on sale next week - is Johnny Depp. 'We have this heritage that we publish good writing and great art and that had been lost,' he explains. 'I mean, it's all very well publishing John Updike in the 60s, but we've got some great writers now. We publish people like Martin Amis but we also use the Alex Ferguson principle of playing Eric Cantona alongside Ryan Giggs. That's why we also use new names such as Giles Foden and Matt Seaton, or James Parker or a TV documentary maker called Eamonn O'Neil who does all our investigative stuff. 'People like that are exciting. They are the new Tom Wolfes. British Esquire should be about finding the new New Journalism. It's just that our covers didn't suggest that you were holding that sort of magazine in your hands. If we were the only men's magazine in the market, like Arena was in 1985, you could put whatever you wanted on the cover. But we're not. The ones that sell the most are the ones with the most childish content and the most girls with the least clothes. Our covers suggested we were like them and put off the sort of reader we wanted to attract.' And yet, surely something that is accepted market wisdom is usually accepted for a reason. Loaded recently put Dennis Hopper on the cover and saw its circulation instantly dip by about 50,000. The IPC board panicked and a missive shot down to Loaded's offices asking them to redress the situation sharpish. Isn't Howarth's plucky stance merely the doomed effort of a worthy editor to buck the inevitable? Won't he be on the phone to Caprice's agent by April? 'The board has given me a year,' he says. 'Well, they've given me forever, but I have said to them that you can't judge this in any less time than a year and they backed me, which was very brave of them. The intention is not to lose circulation, and I think that's achievable. 'I should say that this doesn't mean we're abandoning having women in the magazine. This is not a moral crusade. Even Harold Hayes had shoots with Raquel Welch and Angie Dickinson alongside pieces by Wolfe and Mailer. If we were to go down [in circulation], however, then it becomes interesting. Our advertisers are the kind of people who buy predominately on environment. Prada doesn't buy numbers or it would be advertising in FHM. But it isn't. 'The question is, when do the numbers stop making sense? Given the momentum of the title over the last eight months, I'm convinced our readers will stay with us and we can keep selling over 100,000.' He's already dipped his toe into the water with the international edition of the magazine's last issue. In the UK the cover star was model Kate Groombridge, who sat naked against a white background. Overseas the cover star was Damon Albarn, that issue's big interview. Already, the overseas change has produced results. Both Prada and Hugo Boss, Howarth says, have welcomed the move and hope Esquire will move even further towards its 60s character. The big question, of course, is how the UK reader will react. Do any liberal British men reading this feel prompted to go out and buy Esquire? Over to you.",

      "body": "<p>The Tories have been having such rotten luck recently that you almost feel sorry for them. For months now, their media managers have had about as much trouble generating a positive headline as Neil Hamilton's barrister had getting a word in edgeways with Mohamed Al Fayed.</p> <p>Some elements of the recent run of desperately unhelpful headlines - such as those spawned by the disaster-courting dishonourable former member for Tatton - were the result of a bumper harvest of bad apples, and can hardly be blamed on the luckless party leadership. But in so many day-to-day issues of general political policy, the Tories are constantly coming nowhere in the race for a positive spin on the front pages - even in those papers on whose support it could traditionally count.</p> <p>So when they managed to secure the (unpaid) services of 15 eminent economists to serve on an advisory panel for the beleaguered Tory high command, it was rightly seen as something of a coup. But inept handling of the announcement by a junior party official turned what should have been a minor victory into a major defeat, precipitating the resignation of a prominent member of the committee on the day his appointment was announced. It was yet another Tory fiasco.</p> <p>The 15 names on the Conservative press release were, to most journalists, impressive-sounding but unknown. One name, however, stood out - that of the US economist, Irwin Stelzer. Any mention of Stelzer's name in a British political context always pricks the attention of Westminster-watchers, for Stelzer is not simply the director of a prominent Washington free market-oriented think tank, but one of the few close confidants of a certain Rupert Murdoch.</p> <p>Stelzer, who has known and advised Murdoch for over 20 years, writes columns in the Murdoch-owned New York Post and Sunday Times and is a super-lobbyist on behalf of the media magnet. Almost anywhere around the world where a big Murdoch deal is being pulled off Stelzer's name will not be far from the action. He has been called Murdoch's secret agent. It was doubly interesting that Stelzer should be associated now with the Tories. He is an admirer of Gordon Brown, and a frequent visitor to Downing Street. He is also a staunch Thatcherite who has little time for the political and economic fudges that have stalked the Conservatives since her departure. Murdoch's stable of newspapers has broadly abandoned the Tories, having given themselves up to the prevailing new Labour wind. Stelzer was in on the whole process - reportedly party to a secret, and always-denied deal done between Murdoch and Blair in which the Sun's support for new Labour was guaranteed, provided Blair backed off from outright support of the single currency in the short term.</p> <p>It was a stroke of unseasonal bad luck which made the welcoming of a Murdoch confidant into the bossom of the Conservatives a new year banana skin. The former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, had chosen the same day to launch a vicious broadside against the current leadership, and much of the Westminster press gallery was in Tory meltdown (again) mode.</p> <p>But it was the middle of the holiday period and most publications were operating on skeleton rotas - meaning that Stelzer's appointment, although interesting to the hacks, was surely seen as something of a low priority.</p> <p>But at the Financial Times political desk Cathy Newman's interest was aroused. Perhaps it was her background in media matters - until recently, she was the FT's media correspondent - but whatever the reason, she thought that Stelzer's involvement with the Tories was worthy of note.</p> <p>She sought further comment from Conservative sources, and was rewarded by an off-the-record quote from an adviser to the shadow chancellor Francis Maude - who had assembled the panel. In a comment which was attributed to an 'aide' in the next day's edition, the Maude team member said: 'We're not claiming that Murdoch is back with us or anything of the kind. But it is encouraging that someone so close to Murdoch is happy to sit on our council.'</p> <p>As soon as he read the story in Washington, Stelzer was furious. Despite his close association with the News Corp chief, he hates to be portrayed as a Murdoch frontman, and he dashed off an acidic resignation letter to Maude. 'I do hope that the remaining members [of the committee] will help you to improve the forecasting skills that led you to predict a recession immediately before the nation's rate of economic growth soared and unemployment began to fall,' he concluded acidly.</p> <p>Once again, the Tories were rewarded with a crop of negative headlines. With luckless timing that would have been dismissed as unbelievable had it appeared in a work of political fiction, the Stelzer story broke just as news emerged of further criticism of Hague - this time by his predecessor, John Major.</p> <p>Stelzer himself could not avoid a smile to himself. Sitting at home in his Washington apartment, he remarked that the Tories seem to be getting desperate in their search for a good story. Reflecting on the tale over the weekend, he suggests that the Conservative party must think long and hard about what it stands for if it is to regain the confidence of the traditionally 'Tory' press. Although Stelzer stresses once again that he can't speak for Murdoch, the News International stable is clearly in this category.</p> <p>'I assume media people are intelligent, and there's no reason to believe they are of less than average intelligence, it seems to me the way any politician gets support of media people is through attractive, coherent policies,' he says.</p> <p>As far as Stelzer is concerned, one area where Tory policy is clearly neither attractive nor coherent is European monetary union - a subject close to his heart (he is currently in the process of preparing a Hudson Institute book on European integration). Labour's position of entering economic union when certain criteria are met, Stelzer says, is at least principled - even though he doesn't believe in it.

      "bodyText": "The Tories have been having such rotten luck recently that you almost feel sorry for them. For months now, their media managers have had about as much trouble generating a positive headline as Neil Hamilton's barrister had getting a word in edgeways with Mohamed Al Fayed. Some elements of the recent run of desperately unhelpful headlines - such as those spawned by the disaster-courting dishonourable former member for Tatton - were the result of a bumper harvest of bad apples, and can hardly be blamed on the luckless party leadership. But in so many day-to-day issues of general political policy, the Tories are constantly coming nowhere in the race for a positive spin on the front pages - even in those papers on whose support it could traditionally count. So when they managed to secure the (unpaid) services of 15 eminent economists to serve on an advisory panel for the beleaguered Tory high command, it was rightly seen as something of a coup. But inept handling of the announcement by a junior party official turned what should have been a minor victory into a major defeat, precipitating the resignation of a prominent member of the committee on the day his appointment was announced. It was yet another Tory fiasco. The 15 names on the Conservative press release were, to most journalists, impressive-sounding but unknown. One name, however, stood out - that of the US economist, Irwin Stelzer. Any mention of Stelzer's name in a British political context always pricks the attention of Westminster-watchers, for Stelzer is not simply the director of a prominent Washington free market-oriented think tank, but one of the few close confidants of a certain Rupert Murdoch. Stelzer, who has known and advised Murdoch for over 20 years, writes columns in the Murdoch-owned New York Post and Sunday Times and is a super-lobbyist on behalf of the media magnet. Almost anywhere around the world where a big Murdoch deal is being pulled off Stelzer's name will not be far from the action. He has been called Murdoch's secret agent. It was doubly interesting that Stelzer should be associated now with the Tories. He is an admirer of Gordon Brown, and a frequent visitor to Downing Street. He is also a staunch Thatcherite who has little time for the political and economic fudges that have stalked the Conservatives since her departure. Murdoch's stable of newspapers has broadly abandoned the Tories, having given themselves up to the prevailing new Labour wind. Stelzer was in on the whole process - reportedly party to a secret, and always-denied deal done between Murdoch and Blair in which the Sun's support for new Labour was guaranteed, provided Blair backed off from outright support of the single currency in the short term. It was a stroke of unseasonal bad luck which made the welcoming of a Murdoch confidant into the bossom of the Conservatives a new year banana skin. The former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, had chosen the same day to launch a vicious broadside against the current leadership, and much of the Westminster press gallery was in Tory meltdown (again) mode. But it was the middle of the holiday period and most publications were operating on skeleton rotas - meaning that Stelzer's appointment, although interesting to the hacks, was surely seen as something of a low priority. But at the Financial Times political desk Cathy Newman's interest was aroused. Perhaps it was her background in media matters - until recently, she was the FT's media correspondent - but whatever the reason, she thought that Stelzer's involvement with the Tories was worthy of note. She sought further comment from Conservative sources, and was rewarded by an off-the-record quote from an adviser to the shadow chancellor Francis Maude - who had assembled the panel. In a comment which was attributed to an 'aide' in the next day's edition, the Maude team member said: 'We're not claiming that Murdoch is back with us or anything of the kind. But it is encouraging that someone so close to Murdoch is happy to sit on our council.' As soon as he read the story in Washington, Stelzer was furious. Despite his close association with the News Corp chief, he hates to be portrayed as a Murdoch frontman, and he dashed off an acidic resignation letter to Maude. 'I do hope that the remaining members [of the committee] will help you to improve the forecasting skills that led you to predict a recession immediately before the nation's rate of economic growth soared and unemployment began to fall,' he concluded acidly. Once again, the Tories were rewarded with a crop of negative headlines. With luckless timing that would have been dismissed as unbelievable had it appeared in a work of political fiction, the Stelzer story broke just as news emerged of further criticism of Hague - this time by his predecessor, John Major. Stelzer himself could not avoid a smile to himself. Sitting at home in his Washington apartment, he remarked that the Tories seem to be getting desperate in their search for a good story. Reflecting on the tale over the weekend, he suggests that the Conservative party must think long and hard about what it stands for if it is to regain the confidence of the traditionally 'Tory' press. Although Stelzer stresses once again that he can't speak for Murdoch, the News International stable is clearly in this category. 'I assume media people are intelligent, and there's no reason to believe they are of less than average intelligence, it seems to me the way any politician gets support of media people is through attractive, coherent policies,' he says. As far as Stelzer is concerned, one area where Tory policy is clearly neither attractive nor coherent is European monetary union - a subject close to his heart (he is currently in the process of preparing a Hudson Institute book on European integration). Labour's position of entering economic union when certain criteria are met, Stelzer says, is at least principled - even though he doesn't believe in it. Hague's position is not to enter EMU within a decade. 'It's very hard to ride into battle with the banner 'I want to wait three years longer than Blair wants to wait',' Stelzer says. In some of Stelzer's frequent conversations with Blair, the prime minister has revealed that he can at least understand those who sustain an implacable opposition to the single currency. Michael Portillo, Stelzer suggests, did at least have a position: 'No, never.' It would be one that Hague would do well at least to consider: 'The more you are against it the closer you are to a principle,' Stelzer says. While Hague flounders, Blair's stance is supported by a coherent principle while delivering 'wiggle room' - that all-important room for manoeuvre that all politicians crave.",

On ITV at 6.30, Sir Trevor McDonald has yet to regain the authority which News At Ten gave him. And on Channel 5, a programme built around ITV defector Kirsty Young will now have to be reconstructed.</p> <p>Looking across the main terrestrial bulletins, the lone vibrant exception to this pattern of misery and resentment is Channel 4 News, which has already successfully introduced a Saturday edition and next Sunday (albeit in exchange for losing 30 minutes on Fridays) becomes a seven-day operation.</p> <p>After a year as presenter, reporter, debate referee and celebrity interviewer, anchorman Jon Snow is raring to go. 'I've always had a genuine passion to see a serious Sunday news programme, and I think other channels have missed a trick, that there's a real appetite for something that says, 'the weekend's ending, where are we, what's happened, what's going to happen?' On Saturday, you know, we're getting the best figures of the week, 1.6m heading out to 2m, and my feeling is we could get more. In fact, I'd be disappointed if we don't get 2m.'</p> <p>Jim Gray, lured away from Newsnight by Michael Jackson to edit and overhaul Channel 4 News, says that he soon found that the Saturday bulletin he introduced last year needed to 'rattle along' more than he expected, but is convinced the 'more reflective, more lateral' approach that he initially planned for Saturday will work on a Sunday. Among its other defining features, he adds, will be 'a strong international perspective, investigative stories given room to breathe, and long interviews at the top of the programme.'</p> <p>Asked if he still sees himself as the bolshy 'enemy within' at ITN, Snow laughingly replies, 'not with Jim Gray around - I'm no longer alone. I feel very much part of Channel 4. I feel rather less part of ITN, within which Channel 4 News is a very aberrant creature, but it's ITN who pay me and I haven't worked for anyone else, except briefly in radio. So it's an odd situation, a split-personality thing.'</p> <p>Does the fact that the same organisation is now making bulletins for ITV at 6.30pm and Channel 4 at 7pm cause problems? 'Not really. Because of the way technology has developed, we're able to extract material at the same time. And, anyway, we and ITV are actually rarely scrabbling over the same ground. I don't think, for instance, that we covered the death of Cilla Black's husband in any great depth, but they did it for three minutes.'</p> <p>This is said with dry humour, but his underlying point is serious. 'I mean, ITV's got out of the business of public service broadcasting. News At Ten was a public service. There's a great swathe of people in British society who don't have the time or inclination to watch news before 10pm, and they're entitled to a channel that provides it. By moving the news, ITV have forfeited all right to be called a public service broadcaster.' What's Snow's assessment of the 6.30 bulletin? 'Well, it's 'right for its market',' he replies, grinning broadly.</p> <p>The BBC fares no better, with Newsnight's 11pm Scottish opt-out slated as 'a complete disgrace. In fact, the whole way the BBC has responded to Scotland is very mealy-mouthed. If even Westminster can countenance devolving power, the BBC should certainly have a devolved a 'Scottish Six' news bulletin. The fact that they didn't shows really scared thinking.'</p> <p>Snow has been approached to defect 'from time to time, over the years', but says 'the BBC would have to change profoundly for it to be tempting. It's far better resourced than any of us have ever dreamt of, and it would be wonderful to have all those resources to play with. But on the other hand it would be awful to put up with the stale breath of the bureaucrats who would be peering over your shoulder.</p> <p>'And they do: whenever you meet your BBC counterparts, there's always something burdened about them, they've always got a shoulder sagging - and on that shoulder is the heavy arm of those endless bureaucrats. Even in Jeremy Paxman's case, there's probably four or five layers of accountants and other sorts of creature above him, whereas there's only one person between me and the boss of Channel 4, and that's Jim Gray.'</p> <p>Adding to his enthusiasm for the channel is the way it has belatedly begun to exploit his talents by using him for what he calls 'extra-curricular' work, such as last Thursday's On the Line programme which was Snow's own idea. Alongside the day power was devolved to Northern Ireland - beginning at Seamus Heaney's house in Dublin, and ending at Stormont - and forays to Macedonia and Kosovo, one of his personal highlights of the year was travelling to Australia to chair a rumbustious pre-referendum debate on the monarchy.</p> <p>'Fantastic! I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. If you said to somebody, 'go to a country about which people [here] know nothing and care less, find 80 people nobody here's ever heard of, put them in a studio and make a good programme', they'd think you were mad. But it was wonderful, and it raised issues that are relevant here because in Britain the monarchy is rarely discussed, it's the subject that dares not speak its name.'</p> <p>His interview with Monica Lewinsky is not among the high points he singles out, and he freely admits it was flawed: 'I asked some very fatuous questions, like 'did [Clinton] make you tingle?', which was probably not a very wise idea, but on the other hand nothing about interviewing Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher prepares you for interviewing a young woman who hasn't been found in bed with the President.'</p> <p>Did he fail to ask obvious questions because he was too diffident, as some women profile-writers suggested? 'I might be. It's a difficult problem. You never have to interview 24-year-old women in depth, basically. And as the depths had all sorts of Freudian connotations, I felt I was treading on very, very rocky ground and could have got into really serious trouble - so the fact that I emerged only criticised for not asking more specific questions was OK.</p> <p>'I've often asked myself, 'should I have done a more aggressive, make-the-woman-cry interview?' Barbara Walters did her on the same day and her ambition, which she achieved, was simply to make her cry. But I thought [in my interview] the real Monica came across, perfectly nice and rather naive. And, after all, what's your service to the viewer? It's to share some real insight about who she is. But it would have been interesting to see the difference if Paxo had also intereviewed her.'</p> <p>Famously dubbed 'that pinko' by Denis Thatcher, Snow is unusual among news presenters in the candour of his opinions - about ITN and ITV, for example, or about whether working journalists should accept honours from No 10 (he declined one), but also about political issues. He needs no prompting to defend this openness: 'It's important to stop imagining that there is a human being who is neutral. I don't believe it. There ain't such a thing. What you have to be is fair, to let people state their case, and be aware that the whole way you interview them is shaped by your prejudices, where you're coming from.'</p> <p>Is John Humphrys penning regular columns for the Sunday Times a wholly good thing, then? 'He's a much more irascible and opinionated person than I am, but yes, I believe in an open society, and the more viewers know about what you really think, the more they can form an opinion as to what it is they're being given.</p> <p>'This is probably dangerous territory, but I think it also helps to know how these people live in society. Then you know where they're coming from. There are plenty of presenters with fine stock-holding portfolios and reams of privately educated children, who also come from a particular perspective but don't show their hand.'</p> <p>Describing the movie Broadcast News as 'full of all kinds of truths' about TV journalism, Snow relishes the 'kick bollock and scramble' it depicts, the moments when 'just getting it on air becomes more important than what gets on air' or when 'you hear through your earpiece that something's happened, and you know most of what's been planned is about to go out the window'.</p> <p>He also thinks that news anchors should regularly re-experience the rough-and-tumble of reporting: 'It's a problem that the sausage machine doesn't often release, people such as Trevor [McDonald] and Michael Buerk and Peter Sissons to get the old dust under their feet. And once you become removed from the journalistic process and remain in presenter mode, you begin to lose sight of what's happening.'</p>",

RIA news agency reported today that some 80 more guerrillas had been killed in clashes around Vedeno, home base of rebel commander Shamil Basayev in the mountains south of Grozny. Only three Russian solders were killed, RIA said. Interfax news agency quoted military sources in Mozdok, Russia's main army base in the North Caucasus just outside Chechnya, as saying up to 35 rebel fighters had been killed in the latest clashes in and around Grozny. A spokeswoman for a body representing the mothers of Russian soldiers told Ekho Moskvy radio at least 1,000 federal troops had died and about 3,000 had been wounded during the military operation. The radio said the Russian defence ministry had put the number of federal troops killed until the end of November - roughly two months after the campaign started - at about 300. Acting president Vladimir Putin, propelled into the Kremlin by Boris Yeltsin's shock resignation last Friday, discussed the situation in the Russian-controlled parts of Chechnya today with Nikolai Koshman, Moscow's top representative in the war-racked province.

This erodes confidence and may, in extremis, place individual soldiers in an invidious position.\" Bruce George, the Labour MP for Walsall South who chairs the Commons select committee on defence, said he wanted to see action taken on the shortcomings suggested by the leaked documents. \"The documents ... have raised very interesting points. The defence committee has conducted substantive inquiries after every war, and we have already begun a very serious inquiry into the lessons to be derived from the war in Kosovo,\" said Mr George. \"The defence committee produced a report on the Strategic Defence Review and we reached the conclusion that if the Government wished to achieve its objectives, politically and militarily, then defence expenditure would have to rise beyond the rather miserable level to which it has sunk over the last 15 years. Mr George said he was disturbed about the military's inability to detain war crime suspects. \"This is not a military failure, it is a political inadequacy in which people who were undertaking peace keeping were in fact given inadequate legal tools,\" he said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the equipment failings detailed in the reports would not have damaged the success of any land campaign in Kosovo. The two reports, prepared by a lieutenant colonel and a brigadier, were designed to be as \"critical as possible\" of the armed forces' performance in the campaign, he added. They would form part of a larger review of the military action in Kosovo which will be published later this year. \"We always, after a campaign such as Kosovo, review the events as soon as possible and as critically as possible,\" said the MoD spokesman. \"These reports are two of many such reports. \"They will form part of a balanced overall picture which we will be making public when we publish a report on the campaign later this year.\" He added: \"With our 18 allies in Nato we prepared for a land campaign and were confident that this would have been successfully executed, had it been necessary. Shadow Defence Secretary Iain Duncan Smith called for a wide-ranging inquiry into the military's problems during the Kosovo conflict. Mr Duncan Smith said: \"It's very, very worrying obviously, and it's very worrying that we have to get this via a leaked report. \"The most important thing is that this was pretty much perhaps as good as it will get, because this was done on the previous budget.\" Former Liberal Democrat leader and Balkans expert Paddy Ashdown said the leaked documents suggested serious problems, but added that they contained the kind of complaints frequently voiced following a conflict. \"Well it's undoubtedly very serious and I hope it will be taken seriously. But ... I don't think I can ever remember a single campaign ... in which there were not afterwards natural and proper complaints by frontline soldiers about the inadequacy of the equipment and the staff.\" \"But it has to be put in its context. This was a highly successful operation which was brought off with great skill and courage,\" Mr Ashdown told the Today programme.",

In 18 innings, Hussain, Atherton and Stewart have made 776 runs at an average of 48, which is all you would have expected and a little more, especially given the way they began. It's worth looking at their scores, in chronological order: 0, 0, 0; 0, 16, 86; 108, 82, 15; 3, 70*, 28; 1, 146*, 95; 71, 15, 40. </p> <p>Leaving aside Mark Butcher, who is neither one thing nor the other (like his footwork a lot of the time), the rest of the batting consists of three novices, Vaughan (or his understudy, Darren Maddy), Chris Adams and Andy Flintoff.

      "bodyText": "Home secretary Jack Straw today ordered Konrad Kalejs to leave Britain amid a growing public clamour for the government to throw out the suspected Nazi war criminal. Mr Straw's deportation notice followed an investigation into how Kalejs who was known by Scotland Yard to be suspected of murdering thousands of Jews was allowed into Britain. Kalejs indicated at the weekend that he had seen the writing on the wall. \"I am leaving this country as soon as I can,\" Kalejs told the Mail On Sunday before the deportation notice was officially served on him, \"I have learned my lesson. The police cannot hold me,\" he said. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, which tracks down Nazi war criminals and traced Kalejs to Britain, immediately urged the British government to act. \"We are calling for the British to arrest (Kalejs) and put him on trial for war crimes unless there is an extradition request from Latvia,\" the centre's director, Efraim Zuroff, said. \"Britain should view this as an opportunity to achieve justice rather then as a problem that was thrust in their lap.\" The home office came under heavy criticism since it emerged that Kalejs, an 86-year-old Australian citizen who has previously been deported from Canada and the United States, has been living in a retirement home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire. In a further embarrassment to Mr Straw, the US department of justice told the Guardian it had shared information about Kalejs with the Metropolitan police, while the Yard's now disbanded war crimes unit was investigating another war crimes suspect. Like Kalejs, Harijs Svikeris was also believed to have been part of the notorious Arajs Kommando unit, which was involved in the murder of at least 30,000 people, mainly Jews. Kalejs was identified in his Canadian deportation judgment as a war criminal by Svikeris. The two men are believed to have been joint second in command of the unit. Svikeris, who lived in Milton Keynes, died before he could be prosecuted. A department of justice spokesman said: \"We shared a great deal of our Kalejs material with Scotland Yard for their use in the Svikeris investigation.\" After home office officials admitted they could do nothing to prevent Kalejs leaving Britain, it was feared that he would flee before he could be arrested. He arrived in Britain in July on an Australian passport. Under immigration regulations Kalejs is due to leave on January 6. Australia has said it would take Kalejs back.

Investigators who led the prosecution of Anthony Sawoniuk at the Old Bailey last April have been briefed about Konrad Kalejs, who arrived in Britain last summer and is said by Nazi hunters to be one of the most wanted war criminals still at large. Home office sources admitted yesterday it would be `a race against time'. There is nothing to stop Mr Kalejs, 86, leaving Britain before a proper assessment is made. The UK has not been asked to arrest and extradite him by another country, as in the case of the former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet. And Mr Kalejs has not committed an offence since his arrival in Britain. But with pressure mounting from British and international Jewish groups, specialists from the war crimes unit have reconvened. `Although the unit has been officially disbanded, the expertise remains,' said a home office source. `These cases can take a long time. The officers will consider whether there is enough evidence to make an arrest on the basis of the information they have. If another country requested his arrest then it would be considered in the usual way.' Officers are expected to interview Mr Kalejs within days. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday yesterday, he denied being a war criminal and said he wanted to `leave this country as soon as I can'. He added: `I have learned my lesson. The police cannot hold me. I have been hounded round the world for 15 years, and now I want to be left alone. There's no peace for me here now.' Mr Kalejs arrived in Britain from Australia six months ago and is living in Catthorpe Manor, a retirement home on the Leicestershire/Warwickshire border run by a welfare fund for Britain's Latvian community of 8,000. He checked in under a false name with his common law wife, Austra Kalnins, but she has since returned to Australia. According to the US justice department, Mr Kalejs was joint second in command of the arajs kommandos, a Latvian secret police unit that worked with the Nazis in murdering 30,000 people, mainly Jews. Mr Kalejs, who has held an Australian passport since 1957, is reported to believe that returning to Australia is his best chance of escaping prosecution.

It has never been clear if Richardson's appointment was a calculated gamble by Nixon to give his scandal-ridden administration an air of respectability or whether the president ludicrously misjudged the man he had chosen.</p> <p>Richardson, who has died aged 79, took over the justice department at the height of the senate investigation into the Watergate break-in. The acting director of the FBI, Patrick Gray, had already fallen on his sword for his part in the White House cover-up. Then, on April 30 1973, the president sacked his two principal aides, John Erlichman and Bob Haldeman, and his White House counsel, John Dean. He also accepted that Richard Kleindienst, the attorney general, had been stained by the scandal and must go.</p> <p>Within days, Kleindienst's replacement, Richardson, had decided to get to the bottom of the administration's involvement in this murky affair by selecting Archibald Cox as special prosecutor, asking him to review 'all the documentary evidence available from any source, to which he will have full access'.</p> <p>Unknown outside the administration at the time, the new attorney general was also confronted with unmistakable evidence that vice-president Spiro Agnew had been taking bribes for years.

At one stage, Richardson joked privately that he might soon write a book called Situation Wanted.</p> <p>Matters swiftly came to a head when Alexander Butterfield revealed to senate investigators that President Nixon's Oval Office conversations had been secretly taped for years. The special prosecutor's demand to hear nine of the crucial tapes was rejected by Nixon, on the grounds of executive privilege. The White House offered to summarise the material. Cox stood firm and, on October 20, 1973, Nixon ordered Richardson to sack him and close down the special prosecutor's office. In a tense half-hour confrontation in the Oval Office (with reports flooding in of Israel's penetration into Egypt in the closing stages of the Yom Kippur war) Richardson told the president he had promised Cox full access to all the evidence.</p> <p>He could not obey the president's instruction and would consequently resign. 'Let it be on your head,' said Nixon. 'I'm sorry you can't put the nation's interests above your own concerns.' 'I'd like to feel,' Richardson responded icily, 'that what I'm doing is in the national interest.' Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, was then told to carry out the order. He also refused and resigned. Finally Robert Bork, the solicitor general, formally dismissed Cox, an act which an infuriated senate later avenged by refusing Bork a seat on the supreme court. Alexander Haig, the White House chief of staff, described what followed as 'the days of the firestorm'. Within 48 hours, 150,000 protest telegrams had been delivered to the White House: eventually they totalled 450,000.

Post-war graduation with first-class honours got him a clerkship with the supreme court justice Felix Frankfurter and he moved steadily through the politico-legal landscape of US state and local government. In 1969, Nixon assigned him to the state department, where he helped keep Henry Kissinger and William Rogers from one another's throats.</p> <p>From there he became secretary of health and welfare, a thankless job in which he helped defuse both school desegregation and welfare reform. With this record behind him he was moved to the bureaucratic nightmare facing the secretary of defence; it was not his most glorious hour. As a smooth presenter of even a dodgy brief, he was regularly fielded by the White House to justify its illegal bombing of Cambodia to an increasingly hostile congress. Under President Ford, he served briefly as US ambassador to London and then as commerce secretary: no one else has held as many as four US cabinet posts. His final period in government, which he described as the longest and most demanding, was as head of the US delegation to the UN law of the sea conference from 1977 to 1980.

As he put it, he 'took a cartridge off a record player, taped the crystal to the wood of my violin, attached a shielded wire and plugged it into an amp.''</p> <p>He was born in Pasadena to carnival entertainers and, from the age of six, learned classical violin. At arts high school in Los Angeles, he met Terry and the pair founded the Squires doo-wop vocal group. They also wrote and sang rhythm &amp; blues, as Don &amp; Dewey. They recorded in the early 50s for the Los Angeles Spot and Shade labels, and were then signed by Art Rupe, owner of the Specialty label, for which Little Richard recorded.</p> <p>Between 1957-59, Don &amp; Dewey made singles which often borrowed Little Richard-style rhythms. None was a big hit, although several were later covered by others: I'm Leaving It Up To You was a 1963 hit, which was revived in 1974 by Marie and Donnie Osmond, while the Searchers featured their novelty song. Farmer John.</p> <p>It was while touring with the Johnny Otis review in the late 50s that Harris got his 'Sugarcane' sobriquet, from Otis himself, in recognition of his reputation as a ladies' man. In 1963-64, while with Little Richard's band, Harris played bass as well as violin and featured on the hit Bama Lama Bama Loo.</p> <p>As a teenager, Frank Zappa had been transfixed by Don &amp; Dewey's Soul Motion, which had been produced by Sonny Bono. So Zappa recruited Harris to provide a tough, improvisatory edge to four, mainly instrumental, albums.</p> <p>Harris also toured with and played on blues albums by John Mayall (Union Station) and Harvey Mandel (Choice Cuts). Harris's violin playing, said Mayall, had 'the same sort of vitality that an electric guitar has''.</p> <p>Harris's solo albums included Sugar Cane, which contained an affectionate classical parody, Funk And Wagner, and Fiddler On The Rock (1970) and New Violin Summit (1973) with fellow violinists Jean Luc Ponty and Michael Urbaniak.</p> <p>Harris made several successful European tours. He explained enthusiastic audience reaction there by saying that ''the violin is a very European instrument. Hearing it played so differently, it's a gas to them.'</p> <p>By 1975, reunited with Terry in LA, Don &amp; Dewey were playing oldies' shows. Some attributed his career decline to drug problems and a disinclination to tour. Recordings became infrequent, though in the early 80s, he guested on a ska album with LA punk band Tupelo Chain Sex. According to Terry, he and Harris had recently made new recordings.</p> <p>Harris was divorced and leaves a daughter and two sons.</p> <p>Donald Bowman Harris, musician, born June 18 1938; died November 30 1999</p>",

      "bodyText": "The jazz, blues and rock violinist Don 'Sugarcane' Harris, who has died of pulmonary illness aged 61, played on four of Frank Zappa's albums, including Hot Rats and Weasels Ripped My Flesh; performed with Little Richard's band in the early 60s; and, with his lifelong friend, the pianist Dewey Terry, worked as Don &amp; Dewey from the 50s on. He was also a pioneer in the amplification of the violin. As he put it, he 'took a cartridge off a record player, taped the crystal to the wood of my violin, attached a shielded wire and plugged it into an amp.'' He was born in Pasadena to carnival entertainers and, from the age of six, learned classical violin. At arts high school in Los Angeles, he met Terry and the pair founded the Squires doo-wop vocal group. They also wrote and sang rhythm &amp; blues, as Don &amp; Dewey. They recorded in the early 50s for the Los Angeles Spot and Shade labels, and were then signed by Art Rupe, owner of the Specialty label, for which Little Richard recorded. Between 1957-59, Don &amp; Dewey made singles which often borrowed Little Richard-style rhythms. None was a big hit, although several were later covered by others: I'm Leaving It Up To You was a 1963 hit, which was revived in 1974 by Marie and Donnie Osmond, while the Searchers featured their novelty song. Farmer John. It was while touring with the Johnny Otis review in the late 50s that Harris got his 'Sugarcane' sobriquet, from Otis himself, in recognition of his reputation as a ladies' man. In 1963-64, while with Little Richard's band, Harris played bass as well as violin and featured on the hit Bama Lama Bama Loo. As a teenager, Frank Zappa had been transfixed by Don &amp; Dewey's Soul Motion, which had been produced by Sonny Bono. So Zappa recruited Harris to provide a tough, improvisatory edge to four, mainly instrumental, albums. Harris also toured with and played on blues albums by John Mayall (Union Station) and Harvey Mandel (Choice Cuts). Harris's violin playing, said Mayall, had 'the same sort of vitality that an electric guitar has''. Harris's solo albums included Sugar Cane, which contained an affectionate classical parody, Funk And Wagner, and Fiddler On The Rock (1970) and New Violin Summit (1973) with fellow violinists Jean Luc Ponty and Michael Urbaniak. Harris made several successful European tours. He explained enthusiastic audience reaction there by saying that ''the violin is a very European instrument. Hearing it played so differently, it's a gas to them.' By 1975, reunited with Terry in LA, Don &amp; Dewey were playing oldies' shows. Some attributed his career decline to drug problems and a disinclination to tour. Recordings became infrequent, though in the early 80s, he guested on a ska album with LA punk band Tupelo Chain Sex. According to Terry, he and Harris had recently made new recordings. Harris was divorced and leaves a daughter and two sons. Donald Bowman Harris, musician, born June 18 1938; died November 30 1999",

      "bodyText": "The government took the rare step yesterday of apologising to the thousands of people who had to wait for up to four hours before they were allowed to enter the Millennium Dome on New Year's Eve. Amid widespread criticism of the delays, which marred the event for many specially-invited guests, the minister responsible for the dome blamed \"management problems\". \"It should never have taken as long as it did,\" the cabinet office minister, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said. \"I really apologise to all those people, both VIPs and ordinary people, left waiting.\" His remarks came as the royal family and political leaders took the spiritual lead in ecumenical services around the country. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh joined the prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie at St Paul's cathedral in London, where the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, urged the congregation to remember the Christian values of love and faith in God. The religious services were overshadowed by the continuing fallout over delays at the dome which prompted Greg Dyke, the new director-general of the BBC, to complain to ministers after waiting for three hours at Stratford station, in east London. Lord Falconer did not apportion blame for the delays, but the finger was being pointed last night at the Metropolitan police which placed only one x-ray machine at Stratford station, where many of the dome's 10,500 guests passed through security checks. The mistake by the police compounded the earlier one by the New Millennium Experience Company which failed to mail out thousands of tickets for the opening ceremony on time. Guests who queued for hours for their tickets were then faced by another long queue to pass through the airport-style security system. Lord Falconer insisted last night that the delays had not marred the dome's opening ceremony. \"There were glitches round the edges but the central achievement was very impressive,\" he said. \"In many respects it was the best in the world. People at the dome were united - they were spirited, interested and humorous.\" Lord Falconer joined Mr Blair for yesterday's service at St Paul's, where they heard readings from Bunyan and TS Eliot by the actors Patricia Hodge and Richard Griffiths. Rap singers provided a contemporary touch to Cardiff's millennium service at the Tabernacle church, which was attended by the Prince of Wales and his sons princes William and Harry. In Belfast, the Duke of York joined 2,000 invited guests at the Waterfront hall. Afterwards he joined the Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble at a meeting with groups representing the victims of the Troubles. \"I hope 2000 goes on being very happy over here,\" Prince Andrew said. \"It's very important.\"",

And if nothing else it's another year over and we are still alive - still going strong. Well, most of us, anyway.</p> <p>The days blend together here, all very much the same, but on New Year's Eve we were unlocked late, at 8.30am, to give the officers a lie-in. Lunch was the same as usual - boiled potatoes, steak and kidney pie - but we had exercise in the morning, rather than working or staying in our cells. The sky was fantastically blue and the sun glinted off the razor wire as we walked about in circles.</p> <p>The highlight of the afternoon was a millennium quiz in the small dining room. It was won on the final question: 'Which Teletubby rides a scooter?' The answer, 'Po', secured five phone cards for Grede, the Open University student. Tolerance levels were high - lots of smiling, polite nods all around. Just before lock-up at 7pm the usual round of hand shakes and exchanges of goodwill took place.</p> <p>So, then, to the real excitement. We were locked up alone in our cells at 7pm. I listened to my radio, tuned to Radio 4, 'the prisoner's friend', just waiting for the pips. At ten minutes to midnight every prisoner in the country must have been standing at the door to his cell, blunt instrument in hand. I clutched a coffee tin.</p> <p>At midnight: bedlam. Chaos. Thunderous noise. Everyone banging on their doors together. It only lasts a couple of minutes, I suppose, but it seems to go on for an age. Someone somewhere was playing music - The 1812 Overture - though it was almost drowned out by the swearing, screaming and yowling. I think there were a couple of fires somewhere, as people burned their sheets.</p> <p>On my first new year inside - in the early 80s - I promised myself I wouldn't do the banging. It seemed silly. 'But everybody does it,' said the man who lived in the cell next door to mine as we shuffled along in the breakfast queue. 'It's traditional,' he said.</p> <p>I was in a London prison at the time: all steel gantries and prison officers who wore caps with peaks slashed low over noses. It was not an environment conducive to exuberant expression, unless of course you were being dragged kicking and screaming to the punishment block. And anyway, what if this chap was winding me up? After all we weren't exactly friends. Perhaps he was getting me at it - in the hope of providing himself with a smile at the appointed time. (Him: lying in bed chuckling to the chimes of Big Ben - Me: standing by my cell door waiting for 'the banging' to start, foolishly poised to join in.)</p> <p>By 9 o'clock I was in bed. Sleep, dreams, respite - and then suddenly, noise - lots of noise. My eyes opened wide and stared into the darkness. I pressed the light button at the side of my watch. Twelve midnight.</p> <p>I threw back the bed covers and ran to the door. Pressing my ear to the cold metal I listened in awe. The whole jail was vibrating as cell doors were battered mercilessly by all manner of blunt instruments. The noise was rising to thunderous levels as men by the score joined in.</p> <p>With my heart pounding I rummaged blindly in a locker drawer, until my hand grasped a tin of pilchards. Within seconds I had launched my attack. Bang! Bang! Bang! Ignoring the shock to my hand and arm and using all my strength, I hammered harder. Bang! Bang! Bang! How good it felt. How liberating. How cathartic .</p> <p>A couple of minutes later, save for the sporadic rantings of the more seriously disturbed, it was all over.</p> <p>The following year I was allocated to a long-term jail where I was introduced to more exotic ways of seeing in the new year. Thus I discovered 'shrunken bread syndrome' - and its cause. Illicit homebrew. So much yeast was stolen from the kitchens during the weeks leading up to the end of the year that the bakers were only able to turn out feeble looking loaves barely half the normal size. 'Hooch parties' were all the rage in those days, and 'Hooch masters' paid handsomely for the yeast to make the alcohol. Up to 15 men at a time would squeeze into out-of-the-way cells and guzzle strange brews to their hearts content. No amount of booze could diminish the ritual door banging at midnight however.</p> <p>New Year's Eve 1993 was precarious. The prison officers took the 'Hooch spin' (annual universal cell search) particularly seriously that year, and confiscated 24 gallons of 'Felons' Finest' from one wing. Uproar followed.</p> <p>Eventually a delegation met with the wing governor and heatedly intimated that the wing might be destroyed if the booze was not returned forthwith. Clearly the message had been received, as when the wing was unlocked for evening association there in the corner of the games room, glistening with welcome, stood a wooden cart laden with every type of plastic container imaginable. The evening had been saved. (Of course cannabis users celebrated too, but their festivities tended to be rather on the quiet side, punctuated only by the odd giggling fit.)</p> <p>The authorities have tightened up since then however, and substance abuse of any kind is no longer tolerated. But since the mandatory drug testing programme was introduced in 1994, the use of hard drugs has escalated. (Hard drugs stay in the body's system for a shorter time and so present the smallest risk of a positive test.) Consequently, sitting in a darkened cell with a couple of cohorts sniffing burnt smack (heroin) from the foil of a sweet wrapper seems to have replaced hooch-fuelled singalongs and dope induced catatonia as the most popular method of finding release from the pain of imprisonment these days.</p> <p>But although some things may have changed, the end-of-year rituals remain the same. The same old resolutions are made: the gymnasium is always packed for the first week or so of the new year, but by the second week most aspiring athletes have returned to the safer state of lethargic apathy.</p> <p>Smokers who want to give up bravely fail to buy tobacco on purpose knowing that the prison shop is going to be closed for two weeks. This is good news to their unscrupulous chums who buy extra, knowing that after the first week they'll be able to sell roll-ups for double the normal price.</p> <p>It has to be said however: there seems to be no greater sense of excitement about the arrival of the year 2000 than there was about the arrival of 1999. The nation may be gripped by millennium fever but in here it's passed us by. People are disdainful of all the hype outside, resentful almost, as if it's been forced on them. On New Year's Day we had another late unlock at 9am, but when I came out five minutes later, there was no one around. People emerged slowly through out the morning. No sense of excitement.</p> <p>During morning exercise, I walked with Stu, who we call the Guru. We had towels draped over our heads to protect us from the cold and from a distance we probably looked like a couple of monks. I asked him: 'What d'you make of this new millennium then?'And he said: 'Millennium. What millennium?' It summed up the prevailing attitude in here.</p> <p>Still, a happy new year to you all. And OK, why not? I'll say it for the first time and the last: a happy new millennium to you all.</p>",

But although some things may have changed, the end-of-year rituals remain the same. The same old resolutions are made: the gymnasium is always packed for the first week or so of the new year, but by the second week most aspiring athletes have returned to the safer state of lethargic apathy. Smokers who want to give up bravely fail to buy tobacco on purpose knowing that the prison shop is going to be closed for two weeks. This is good news to their unscrupulous chums who buy extra, knowing that after the first week they'll be able to sell roll-ups for double the normal price. It has to be said however: there seems to be no greater sense of excitement about the arrival of the year 2000 than there was about the arrival of 1999. The nation may be gripped by millennium fever but in here it's passed us by. People are disdainful of all the hype outside, resentful almost, as if it's been forced on them. On New Year's Day we had another late unlock at 9am, but when I came out five minutes later, there was no one around. People emerged slowly through out the morning. No sense of excitement. During morning exercise, I walked with Stu, who we call the Guru. We had towels draped over our heads to protect us from the cold and from a distance we probably looked like a couple of monks. I asked him: 'What d'you make of this new millennium then?'And he said: 'Millennium. What millennium?' It summed up the prevailing attitude in here. Still, a happy new year to you all. And OK, why not? I'll say it for the first time and the last: a happy new millennium to you all.",

George VI said it during a Christmas broadcast in 1939. We had no idea if we would reach 1940 or, more immediately, if he would reach the end of his sentence, given as he was to prolonged silences struggling with a stammer. The quotation propelled an unpretentious poetess called Minnie Haskins blinking into the light.</p> <p>The gate of the year was a revolving door during the BBC's live coverage of the millennium around the world, described as the biggest and most ambitious programme ever made.</p> <p>Everyone on earth wanted light. Nelson Mandela, walking stiff-legged and set-faced, lit a candle in his old cell. Those with money to burn frightened the night with fireworks according to their temperament. Sydney showily. Paris elegantly. Moscow economically, having a more sinister use for gunpowder. Stonehaven swung great balls of fire. Those with no money at all summoned the sun with song and dance.</p> <p>John Simpson, seasick and out of sync, had clearly had a bumpy five days on a tramp steamer reaching Millennium Island, the rising sun's first port of call.

      "bodyText": "A couple of lines, forgotten for 60 years, have been on my mind lately. 'I said to a man who stood at the gate of the year 'Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown'.' I doubt if anyone but a couple of queens remembers it now. George VI said it during a Christmas broadcast in 1939. We had no idea if we would reach 1940 or, more immediately, if he would reach the end of his sentence, given as he was to prolonged silences struggling with a stammer. The quotation propelled an unpretentious poetess called Minnie Haskins blinking into the light. The gate of the year was a revolving door during the BBC's live coverage of the millennium around the world, described as the biggest and most ambitious programme ever made. Everyone on earth wanted light. Nelson Mandela, walking stiff-legged and set-faced, lit a candle in his old cell. Those with money to burn frightened the night with fireworks according to their temperament. Sydney showily. Paris elegantly. Moscow economically, having a more sinister use for gunpowder. Stonehaven swung great balls of fire. Those with no money at all summoned the sun with song and dance. John Simpson, seasick and out of sync, had clearly had a bumpy five days on a tramp steamer reaching Millennium Island, the rising sun's first port of call. Only coconut crabs live there so both celebrants and TV crew had to be bussed in. One singer died on the boat and had to be briskly buried on an offshore island. The survivors refreshed themselves with a magic potion. It had a visibly cheering effect. Substantially built dancers in stout, cotton bras greeted the sun as, he translated, a young woman greets her lover. Their faces shone gold like buttered crumpets.

      "body": "<p>Conservative leader William Hague found his party at the centre of another embarrassing political row yesterday when a senior member of his shadow cabinet called for a speedy Russian victory in Chechnya.</p> <p>In remarks which were immediately condemned by Labour, the shadow foreign secretary John Maples, called on the government to moderate its criticism of the Russians despite their ferocious bombardment of the Chechen capital Grozny.</p> <p>Speaking on Sky News, Mr Maples said: \"We ought to be careful of the tone in which we criticise the Russians because there is nothing we can do about it. The Russians are set upon the policy they are pursuing. The sooner they are successful, the better.\"</p> <p>Mr Maples added that reports of chemical weapons being used by the Chechen rebels showed that the conflict would be brutal.</p> <p>\"All the west can do is try to persuade the Russians to seek a negotiated settlement... and to do whatever we can to alleviate the suffering of refugees,\" Mr Maples said.</p> <p>Labour seized on the latest Tory blunder, which appeared to endorse the Russian assault on Grozny, even though it has been condemned worldwide. Gerald Kaufman, a former shadow foreign secretary, dismissed Mr Maples' remarks.</p> <p>\"It is fortunate that the views of the Conservative party do not count for anything. If they did, the thoughtless statement by John Maples could do serious damage to international efforts to bring the fighting to an end,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It sounds as though he believes the only course of action is a victory by arms. That is not the policy of the United Nations, that is not the policy of the United Kingdom and it should not be the policy of any responsible politician.\"</p> <p>A Tory spokesman insisted last night that Mr Maples stood by his remarks. Tories also pointed out that no minister had responded to Mr Maples because he had spoken the uncomfortable truth.</p> <p>However, Mr Maples's indelicate use of language is likely to raise questions about his future in the shadow cabinet. He is seen as one of the weakest members of Mr Hague's frontbench team and could be eased out later this year to make way for Michael Portillo.</p> <p>Mr Maples's blunder came as Steven Norris added his voice to the growing band of Tory heavyweights who have called on Mr Hague to avoid a lurch to the right.</p> <p>Mr Norris, the frontrunner to win the Tory nomination for the London mayoral election, said Mr Hague should steer clear of \"cheap cheers\" which alienate mainstream voters.</p> <p>\"It is natural for parties to want to regress to what they regard as their heartlands,\" Mr Norris told Radio 4's World This Weekend. \"I think that is a temptation which has to be avoided. You get a great cheer at your party conference but you will be addressing an ever-diminishing audience.\"</p> <p>\"If the Tories were to move back to a hardline, rightwing, law and order party that was nationalistic, antipathetic to minorities and so on then it might appeal to a very small section of the population.</p> <p>\"But it will never appeal to the 40% of the population it needs if it is to win power.\"</p>",

In remarks which were immediately condemned by Labour, the shadow foreign secretary John Maples, called on the government to moderate its criticism of the Russians despite their ferocious bombardment of the Chechen capital Grozny. Speaking on Sky News, Mr Maples said: \"We ought to be careful of the tone in which we criticise the Russians because there is nothing we can do about it. The Russians are set upon the policy they are pursuing. The sooner they are successful, the better.\" Mr Maples added that reports of chemical weapons being used by the Chechen rebels showed that the conflict would be brutal. \"All the west can do is try to persuade the Russians to seek a negotiated settlement... and to do whatever we can to alleviate the suffering of refugees,\" Mr Maples said. Labour seized on the latest Tory blunder, which appeared to endorse the Russian assault on Grozny, even though it has been condemned worldwide. Gerald Kaufman, a former shadow foreign secretary, dismissed Mr Maples' remarks. \"It is fortunate that the views of the Conservative party do not count for anything. If they did, the thoughtless statement by John Maples could do serious damage to international efforts to bring the fighting to an end,\" he said. \"It sounds as though he believes the only course of action is a victory by arms. That is not the policy of the United Nations, that is not the policy of the United Kingdom and it should not be the policy of any responsible politician.\" A Tory spokesman insisted last night that Mr Maples stood by his remarks. Tories also pointed out that no minister had responded to Mr Maples because he had spoken the uncomfortable truth. However, Mr Maples's indelicate use of language is likely to raise questions about his future in the shadow cabinet. He is seen as one of the weakest members of Mr Hague's frontbench team and could be eased out later this year to make way for Michael Portillo. Mr Maples's blunder came as Steven Norris added his voice to the growing band of Tory heavyweights who have called on Mr Hague to avoid a lurch to the right. Mr Norris, the frontrunner to win the Tory nomination for the London mayoral election, said Mr Hague should steer clear of \"cheap cheers\" which alienate mainstream voters. \"It is natural for parties to want to regress to what they regard as their heartlands,\" Mr Norris told Radio 4's World This Weekend. \"I think that is a temptation which has to be avoided. You get a great cheer at your party conference but you will be addressing an ever-diminishing audience.\" \"If the Tories were to move back to a hardline, rightwing, law and order party that was nationalistic, antipathetic to minorities and so on then it might appeal to a very small section of the population. \"But it will never appeal to the 40% of the population it needs if it is to win power.\"",

The babies, Aspen and Saffron Drewitt-Barlow, were conceived after Barrie Drewitt and Tony Barlow found a surrogate mother in California who was willing to carry the children after one of the couple provided the sperm and the egg came from a separate donor. But when they arrived back in Britain last week, immigration officials immediately detained the babies and their parents were questioned for more than an hour. The babies' US passports were confiscated and they were granted temporary admission to Britain for a month while the issue of their immigration status is resolved. Mr Drewitt, 32, a businessman from Danbury, Essex, said he would write to Tony Blair asking for a meeting with the home secretary, as the case appeared to be a case of discrimination against the children of gay couples. He said it had been frightening to be detained at Heathrow airport. He told the Mail on Sunday: 'They asked us if the twins needed anything and put us and the two nannies in a small interview room with no windows or air conditioning for over an hour. 'They were asking who the parents of the children were, and Tony and I said: 'We are.' They could not get their heads round that at all.' His partner, Mr Barlow, 35, told the newspaper: 'We have been told that we were very lucky to get a month. Sometimes they only give you 24 hours.' In an interview with Sky News yesterday, he said: 'It's stressful. We've been through so much before, just to get pregnant and then worrying all through the pregnancy. All we want to do is just get on with our lives.' The US supreme court names both men as the children's parents on their birth certificates, recognising them as 'parent one' and 'parent two', following a ruling. The couple said they would take the matter up with the European court of human rights if necessary. They have consulted a solicitor who has advised them that under UK law, British citizenship can only pass through a father if he is married to a baby's mother. If either of the men had adopted the babies, then they would have automatically gained British citizenship. A home office spokeswoman said: 'As a general principle we will be looking at what is best for the children consistent with UK law and what precedent will be set.'

      "bodyText": "Ministers are planning revolutionary adventure-style summer camps for all 16-year-olds to develop their self-confidence and help them mature more quickly. The scheme, to be announced this week by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, is designed to provide an exciting and enriching experience for all young people at the end of their years of compulsory education. Camps running between June and September will offer outdoor trips including climbing, orienteering and survival skills, some of which may take place abroad. Other options will include extended work experience and voluntary jobs in the local community. Mr Blunkett is particularly anxious to target the thousands of young people who leave school at 16 without qualifications and have no plans for further education, training or work. He fears that many will become permanent dropouts unless something is done to awaken an interest in continuing education. But the government thinks places at the camps should be offered to all 16-year-olds, regardless of academic attainment or family income.

He added that the right balance had now been struck with the unions, and praised Mr Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for rescuing the Labour party from its 'unsatisfactory' state in the 1980s. Lord Callaghan, who calls himself Original Labour rather than New Labour, sympathised with Mr Blair's habit of consulting Baroness Thatcher more often than himself. But this did not say anything about New Labour's policies, he said. 'I think all it says is that he turns to somebody who won four [sic] elections instead of somebody who didn't win any.'",

This show on Chatsworth also has the bonus of the Duke of Devonshire, an engaging gentleman who comes across like PG Wodehouse's batty Lord Emsworth. But with GCSEs.</p> <p><strong>The Oldest Tree On Earth: The Curse Of Methuselah<br>7.30pm, Channel 4</strong><br>Perhaps it's appropriate, but this documentary devoted to the Methuselah Tree, a shabby bristlecone pine growing on a remote Californian mountain which is the world's oldest living organism at a staggering 4,643 years old, begins slowly. But gradually, with the help of especially commissioned poems from Roger McGough, a narrative tracing humanity's history over the course of the tree's life emerges - a tale that encompasses ancient civilisations, the settlement of America by Europeans and the testing of atom bombs 100 miles away in the Nevada Desert. A gentle film that nonetheless grapples with the issue of our own mortality.</p> <p><strong>Longitude<br>8.30pm, Channel 4</strong><br>The second part of this marvellous adaptation of Dava Sobel's bestseller is, quite simply, unmissable. The story picks up with 18th century clockmaker John Harrison (Michael Gambon) still struggling to design a clock accurate enough to help sailors plot their position at sea. At every turn, he faces opposition from a bigoted scientific establishment who hate the idea of a mere artisan solving the problem. Ambitious and intelligent, this is period drama that never gets hidebound by the distracting eye-candy of costumes and settings. Instead, director Charles Sturridge allows the performances of Gambon, Ian Hart as Harrison's son William and Jeremy Irons as Rupert Gould (who restored Harrison's clocks in the 20th century) to shine through. Mesmerising. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Great Estates 12.45pm, Channel 4 Quite why film-makers are so keen to give free PR to Britain's landed nobs is one of TV's eternal mysteries. A subtle plot to hasten the revolution? Whatever, this new series on Britain's stately piles mostly succeeds because it focuses on the staff responsible for maintenance and restoration. This show on Chatsworth also has the bonus of the Duke of Devonshire, an engaging gentleman who comes across like PG Wodehouse's batty Lord Emsworth. But with GCSEs. The Oldest Tree On Earth: The Curse Of Methuselah 7.30pm, Channel 4 Perhaps it's appropriate, but this documentary devoted to the Methuselah Tree, a shabby bristlecone pine growing on a remote Californian mountain which is the world's oldest living organism at a staggering 4,643 years old, begins slowly. But gradually, with the help of especially commissioned poems from Roger McGough, a narrative tracing humanity's history over the course of the tree's life emerges - a tale that encompasses ancient civilisations, the settlement of America by Europeans and the testing of atom bombs 100 miles away in the Nevada Desert. A gentle film that nonetheless grapples with the issue of our own mortality. Longitude 8.30pm, Channel 4 The second part of this marvellous adaptation of Dava Sobel's bestseller is, quite simply, unmissable. The story picks up with 18th century clockmaker John Harrison (Michael Gambon) still struggling to design a clock accurate enough to help sailors plot their position at sea. At every turn, he faces opposition from a bigoted scientific establishment who hate the idea of a mere artisan solving the problem. Ambitious and intelligent, this is period drama that never gets hidebound by the distracting eye-candy of costumes and settings. Instead, director Charles Sturridge allows the performances of Gambon, Ian Hart as Harrison's son William and Jeremy Irons as Rupert Gould (who restored Harrison's clocks in the 20th century) to shine through. Mesmerising.",

Then we were encouraged to look forward to a new international age, free from superpower strife, when efforts would be focused on real problems: poverty, ill-health, injustice and the environment.</p> <p>The UN-led war against Saddam Hussein encouraged optimism: the international body, no longer paralysed by the veto, was able to act against aggression. The US and Russia began to roll back their arsenals and the fear of global obliteration receded.</p> <p>Those forecasts now seem hopelessly utopian. New conflicts have broken out in areas we were hardly aware of; world poverty continues to rise. There are two new nuclear powers. The UN's reputation has been deeply dented by its inadequate response to a string of humanitarian crises. The mood is shifting from utopia to dystopia.</p> <p>What sort of world are we living in where the perspective can change so fast? Predictions remain difficult but four areas will vitally affect our global future - the prospects for China, Africa, the UN and disarmament.</p> <p><b>China</b></p> <p>China enters the new millennium as a giant with shaky foundations. Assessments of its prospects from outside continue to be wildly inconsistent. Will it become the world's second economic power within 20 years or be brought down by massive political and social contradictions? Is a strong China good for Asia or a potential threat?</p> <p>Everyone agrees on one thing: stability in China is crucial for the region and the world - note the huge sigh of relief in 1997-98 when Beijing refrained from devaluing its renminbi currency, and thus saved the Asian economic crisis from becoming a global disaster.</p> <p>The greatest risk now faced by China, many believe, is that the communist regime will fail to adapt and will meet the same fate as that of the Soviet Union, plunging the country into chaos and risking disintegration. Certainly the current leadership of Jiang Zemin has disappointed by maintaining the brake on political reform. Somehow the momentum checked by the 1989 Beijing massacre has to resume. Yet the comparison with the Soviet Union is inexact. China's version of perestroika, unlike that of Mikhail Gorbachev, will continue to deliver enough goods to enough people to buy acquiescence.</p> <p>The politically alienated of 1989 are already returning to make money. More will come back when Beijing joins the World Trade Organisation. Patriotism is not a discredited concept, and a sense of common identity - far stronger than the artificial Soviet version - will endure, reinforced by the overseas Chinese community. The party is not loved, but neither is it hated; instead it is seen as an apparatus of government which in one form or another China needs. Popular protest at corruption and privilege focuses on specific complaints, without demanding the party's overthrow.</p> <p>But China will pay an increasingly high environmental price for the policy of maximising the growth which buys it stability. In the long run, pouring concrete over fertile land is a recipe for disaster. Mounting floods and diminishing naturalresources will hit particularly hard those in poor areas who have already missed out on the economic boom.</p> <p>By the year 2050, a population well above 1.5bn people will face severe water and land shortages, heightened by a growing concentration in urban areas near the coast. Pollution could rise by 600%, with hidden costs to health and productivity. Cities will fail to provide adequate services for the rural migrants on whom they depend, and whose numbers should reach 220m within 10 years.</p> <p>The police and security forces will be strengthened to deal with rising crime. As in Indonesia, an underclass of the under-employed will provide a reservoir of social unrest.</p> <p>China's complete entry into the world market will remove the last barriers which have cushioned its economy: the renminbi will fluctuate and export industries will become increasingly vulnerable to competition from other developing labour forces. Beijing's nightmare scenario - a surge of domestic unrest coinciding with a western economic slump - will one day become reality.</p> <p>China will pour resources into defence and prestige projects to achieve the aim of becoming `the giant of Asia'' by the year 2050, leading to recurrent tensions with Japan and an unstable Russia.</p> <p>The love-hate relationship with the US will be tested to destruction over Taiwan: sooner or later (probably sooner) Beijing will be tempted, or obliged for internal political reasons, to make a challenge across the strait. Repression of alleged `splittism'' in the non-Han Chinese western regions will provoke what it seeks to prevent: the challenge will come first from Muslim militants in Xinjiang, then from Tibetan activists after the death of the Dalai Lama.</p> <p>Slowly new generations will realise that the only solution to these problems is to reject the concepts of centralised rule based on the Chinese empire.</p> <p><b>Africa</b></p> <p>Will Africa be the forgotten orphan of the 21st century? It limped out of the 20th with little more prestige or autonomy than it had at the beginning of it, when most of its states were ruled by European colonialism. It will not be in a position to reverse this powerlessness alone, and it will be in the rest of the world's urgent self-interest to offer massive financial and technical aid. This will be the only way to stem Africa's contribution to the growing problems of global warming, the spread of the Aids pandemic and unrest in Europe as the angry poor outnumber the rich with the influx of men fleeing economic and political insecurity in Africa.</p> <p>The speed of technological change in the 21st century, and the world's domination by a knowledge-based economy will be a threat, rather than an opportunity, for the continent. Inevitably this trend will further marginalise Africa.</p> <p>On present trends, in 15 years three-quarters of all the world's school-age children who are not able to go to school will live in Africa. The yawning education gap will prevent the continent moving towards more democratic and accountable government. Instead it will still be prone to see its people swept easily into the primitive fascist movements which have managed in the late 20th century to destroy country after country in west and central Africa in civil wars.</p> <p>These wars for resources, easily fired by ethnicity, by extensive drug abuse and by the use of impressionable children as cannon fodder could simply spiral on from one generation to another with no political force capable of redrawing the map of these countries' alternative possibilities.</p> <p>One new force of the century will be the increasingly powerful non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The erosion of national sovereignty in the face of the western human rights lobbies was one of the more remarkable phenomena of the last two decades of the 20th century. In the 21st it will be not only the confident and ambitious NGOs which dictate policies to African governments, but the multinationals who will be obliged by their shareholders to answer publicly for every policy or financial transaction in the countries where they operate.</p> <p><b>United Nations</b></p> <p>An effective UN will be crucial for the 21st century, as nation states show no signs of being able to regulate disputes peacefully and ethnic conflict is on the increase.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has been publicly criticised in an independent report for his role in the UN's failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda in 1994. This report came hard on the heels of Nato taking the lead in the Kosovo war; on the long stalemate on Iraq which reduced its people to abject poverty; and on the failure of UN-supervised elections and years of fruitless negotiations in Angola.</p> <p>Meanwhile the US continues to hobble the organisation by failing to pay its dues in full while demanding the right to approve all significant UN initiatives.</p> <p>Yet expectations of the UN are higher than ever, while international law is changing to give it a wider mandate. As environmental and man-made catastrophes multiply, UN agencies will be asked to perform miracles to bring food and medicine to millions of victims.</p> <p>The UN's future will depend on how soon these new pressures lead to structural change. These must include the long postponed enlargement of the security council, more democratic decision-making, more secure funding for specialised agencies and the formation of permanent peacekeeping forces. The prospect of any of this happening may seem unlikely now. But international disaster in the 21st century will concentrate minds and promote a new demand for international solutions.</p> <p><b>Disarmament</b></p> <p>The world will face new types of conflict which national governments and even established groupings like the EU are still not prepared for, despite their rhetoric.</p> <p>The threat of further proliferation will put the prospects for nuclear peace throughout this century to a severe test. A new arms race will also start if the Nato allies fail to dissuade the US from plans for a national anti-ballistic missile shield. President Bill Clinton is expected to give the go-ahead to this expensive `Son of Star Wars', which is enthusiastically backed by the Republican candidate George Bush. The Democratic front-runner, Al Gore. may have to support it reluctantly.</p> <p>The strong security element in the Russian leadership - enhanced by the rise of Vladimir Putin - increases the danger of conflict between a revanchist Moscow and the US, with a side-current of discord between the Nato powers over how far Russia has legitimate security concerns.</p> <p>The Europeans believe that the US wants a series of `regional anti-missile shields'', one to protect Israel, another for Taiwan and Japan. The plan is also directed at China, provoking Beijing's military to a new arms race. Moscow has also reacted angrily to US proposals to amend the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty and is deploying more advanced missiles. European concerns are deepened by the US senate's refusal last year to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty.</p> <p>Prospects for the non-proliferation treaty review conference, to be held in New York in April, do not look good. The five official nuclear weapons states are not giving a lead. Indeed, the US is developing new warheads for its Trident system, on which Britain relies.</p> <p>Instead of constructing nuclear shields, western strategy will have to find new ways of bringing `pariah states'' into the international community.</p> <p>As the environment deteriorates, new sources of conflict will also emerge over scarce resources such as water.</p> <p>The next one or two decades will be make or break time for the choice. We can either continue down the road of nuclear proliferation, with ever smaller weapons, plus chemical and biological weapons, which can also be used by terrorists. Or the nuclear five must take a new road to convince the world that they are serious about disarmament.</p>",

Inevitably this trend will further marginalise Africa. On present trends, in 15 years three-quarters of all the world's school-age children who are not able to go to school will live in Africa. The yawning education gap will prevent the continent moving towards more democratic and accountable government. Instead it will still be prone to see its people swept easily into the primitive fascist movements which have managed in the late 20th century to destroy country after country in west and central Africa in civil wars. These wars for resources, easily fired by ethnicity, by extensive drug abuse and by the use of impressionable children as cannon fodder could simply spiral on from one generation to another with no political force capable of redrawing the map of these countries' alternative possibilities. One new force of the century will be the increasingly powerful non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The erosion of national sovereignty in the face of the western human rights lobbies was one of the more remarkable phenomena of the last two decades of the 20th century. In the 21st it will be not only the confident and ambitious NGOs which dictate policies to African governments, but the multinationals who will be obliged by their shareholders to answer publicly for every policy or financial transaction in the countries where they operate. United Nations An effective UN will be crucial for the 21st century, as nation states show no signs of being able to regulate disputes peacefully and ethnic conflict is on the increase. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has been publicly criticised in an independent report for his role in the UN's failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda in 1994. This report came hard on the heels of Nato taking the lead in the Kosovo war; on the long stalemate on Iraq which reduced its people to abject poverty; and on the failure of UN-supervised elections and years of fruitless negotiations in Angola. Meanwhile the US continues to hobble the organisation by failing to pay its dues in full while demanding the right to approve all significant UN initiatives. Yet expectations of the UN are higher than ever, while international law is changing to give it a wider mandate. As environmental and man-made catastrophes multiply, UN agencies will be asked to perform miracles to bring food and medicine to millions of victims. The UN's future will depend on how soon these new pressures lead to structural change. These must include the long postponed enlargement of the security council, more democratic decision-making, more secure funding for specialised agencies and the formation of permanent peacekeeping forces. The prospect of any of this happening may seem unlikely now. But international disaster in the 21st century will concentrate minds and promote a new demand for international solutions. Disarmament The world will face new types of conflict which national governments and even established groupings like the EU are still not prepared for, despite their rhetoric. The threat of further proliferation will put the prospects for nuclear peace throughout this century to a severe test. A new arms race will also start if the Nato allies fail to dissuade the US from plans for a national anti-ballistic missile shield. President Bill Clinton is expected to give the go-ahead to this expensive `Son of Star Wars', which is enthusiastically backed by the Republican candidate George Bush. The Democratic front-runner, Al Gore. may have to support it reluctantly. The strong security element in the Russian leadership - enhanced by the rise of Vladimir Putin - increases the danger of conflict between a revanchist Moscow and the US, with a side-current of discord between the Nato powers over how far Russia has legitimate security concerns. The Europeans believe that the US wants a series of `regional anti-missile shields'', one to protect Israel, another for Taiwan and Japan. The plan is also directed at China, provoking Beijing's military to a new arms race. Moscow has also reacted angrily to US proposals to amend the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty and is deploying more advanced missiles. European concerns are deepened by the US senate's refusal last year to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty. Prospects for the non-proliferation treaty review conference, to be held in New York in April, do not look good. The five official nuclear weapons states are not giving a lead. Indeed, the US is developing new warheads for its Trident system, on which Britain relies. Instead of constructing nuclear shields, western strategy will have to find new ways of bringing `pariah states'' into the international community. As the environment deteriorates, new sources of conflict will also emerge over scarce resources such as water. The next one or two decades will be make or break time for the choice. We can either continue down the road of nuclear proliferation, with ever smaller weapons, plus chemical and biological weapons, which can also be used by terrorists. Or the nuclear five must take a new road to convince the world that they are serious about disarmament.",

      "body": "<p>It's the voice that arrives first: it doesn't so much waft as cascade down the corridor - a juicy, actor's voice, enjoying its own resonance among the hushed tones of pre-lunch drinks at a sombre London club. Then, there he is, in a sharp navy suit and shiny lavender tie. He is instantly recognisable except for one detail: it's as if someone has ironed his face.</p> <p>Ever since the mid-70s, when John Hurt emerged from the classical theatre into the cathode glare of television, his parchment features have seemed to hold all of life's disappointments, all its bad mornings-after-worse-nights-before, in its creases and folds.</p> <p>Reviews of Krapp's Last Tape, the Samuel Beckett monodrama which brings him back to London this month, give no reason to expect any different. 'What makes Hurt a natural for this role,' wrote one critic, 'is that he possesses a face full of wrecked Rembrandtesque fascination, suggesting acres of pained and mysterious hinterland, and a voice that has an extraordinarily kippered lived-in intimacy.' Another critic suggested that, with his seamed, pouchy features and shock of close-cut, iron-grey hair, he bore a striking resemblance to Samuel Beckett himself.</p> <p>Hurt himself has said that 'what I am now, the man, the actor, is a blend of all that has happened'. Yet today his face looks ironed smooth of past troubles, and there are three possible explanations. One is that he is happy, and his new-found domestic stability - in Ireland, with a woman 20 years his junior - has combined with a new-found sobriety to smooth his features. Another possibility is that he is thriving on being back at centre-stage again. 'When you've been away from an audience as long as I have - and it's four years since I was last on stage, in A Month in the Country - you do begin to miss an audience.'</p> <p>A third possibility, offered by Hurt, is that he doesn't buy the view of Beckett as an old miserabilist. And since part of being an actor is selling what you're doing, John Hurt is selling good humour. 'He had to put up with so many misperceptions, poor old Sam. He's got this reputation for being gloomy but he's actually not at all,' he says. When pressed, he concedes that Krapp is a moving play - 'not just touching but seriously moving; it's a whole life; it's everything. The point about Beckett is that his writing is so good that there is only one way to do it. He seems to distil it and distil it until he's got only the finest alcohol left.'</p> <p>In what depths of his own experience does Hurt find a performance that has been described as invaded by pain? 'Heaven knows where it comes from. It wouldn't have occurred to me that I could do it, but then I don't think actors are very good at choosing their own parts,' he says.</p> <p>I had expected him to be tetchy about personal questions but he only looks awkward when he is asked about acting. 'I dread these questions. You see, you can't talk about it. It's an imaginative leap in the end, not an intellectual leap.' Twenty years ago, when he'd just appeared in Alien, in which his stomach had ripped open to produce a monster, an American reporter asked if he was a method actor. Hurt tore open his shirt to reveal an appendicitis scar, and snarled: 'Listen, if Robert De Niro can put on a few pounds...'</p> <p>Actually, he says, 'Though I've been quoted as saying I don't like method acting, what I don't like is when acting becomes therapy. I find that troublesome.' As he says it, he gives a glimpse of the quiet fretfulness that infused his portrayal of the lonely writer Giles De'Ath in his recent film, Love and Death on Long Island. Besotted with a Hollywood teen idol, and besieged by technology, his features seemed to play obsession like a piano: now tragic, now absurd, now magnificently selfish. He can pack a whole emotional universe into the twitch of an eyebrow, a sardonic slackening of the mouth.</p> <p>It is a performance so compelling, so 'real' that I find myself wondering whether Hurt is obsessive; whether, unlike De'Ath, he can handle a video or a fax machine. This is the irony that has dogged Hurt's career: he is not the sort of heroic actor who annexes roles to his own overwhelming personality. Rather, he is a character actor - 'not,' he says, 'in the American sense of someone who is always the same, but in the English sense of someone who plays characters.'</p> <p>Yet there has been a common thread through three decades of work and 90-odd films - a sense of melancholy, of waste, of self-loathing. It's there in Stephen Ward, the Profumo fall guy of Scandal; it was there in the junkie convict of Midnight Express, in the effete Caligula of I, Claudius and - perhaps most memorably - in The Naked Civil Servant, his TV film based on the autobiography of Quentin Crisp. However accomplished, however technically composed these performances have been, people have always looked for clues to them in his life. He finds this irritating .('I've had people say they had me in mind when they wrote something, and I've always said, 'Which bit of me?'').</p> <p>Yet he has displayed a clumsy genius for allowing his life to hold a mirror up to his art. He has admitted that, while shooting Midnight Express (1978), he got through up to seven bottles of wine a day. After White Mischief (1987), a film about dissolute Kenyan settlers, he and his second wife, Donna, built themselves a mansion in the Kenyan hills and had public spats about his drinking. More troublingly, in the run-up to Champions (1983) - a biopic about the jockey Bob Champion - his long-term partner Marie-Lise was killed in a riding accident. In talking openly and honestly about her death, he allowed it to become a film-marketing dream. Wisely, perhaps, his two young children from his third marriage, which broke down in the mid-90s, have been declared a no-talk zone. He is clearly terrified of endangering his relationship with them.</p> <p>Hurt is as candid as ever about himself, though: 'I suppose I had a reputation as a hellraiser,' he says, 'but it's very odd because I never really was. It's just that I lived very publicly and never pretended to be private. I've always lived in the streets. I still walk everywhere and, of course, I've been drunk like most people have, but I just got unlucky, like I did at school.

      "bodyText": "It's the voice that arrives first: it doesn't so much waft as cascade down the corridor - a juicy, actor's voice, enjoying its own resonance among the hushed tones of pre-lunch drinks at a sombre London club. Then, there he is, in a sharp navy suit and shiny lavender tie. He is instantly recognisable except for one detail: it's as if someone has ironed his face. Ever since the mid-70s, when John Hurt emerged from the classical theatre into the cathode glare of television, his parchment features have seemed to hold all of life's disappointments, all its bad mornings-after-worse-nights-before, in its creases and folds. Reviews of Krapp's Last Tape, the Samuel Beckett monodrama which brings him back to London this month, give no reason to expect any different. 'What makes Hurt a natural for this role,' wrote one critic, 'is that he possesses a face full of wrecked Rembrandtesque fascination, suggesting acres of pained and mysterious hinterland, and a voice that has an extraordinarily kippered lived-in intimacy.' Another critic suggested that, with his seamed, pouchy features and shock of close-cut, iron-grey hair, he bore a striking resemblance to Samuel Beckett himself. Hurt himself has said that 'what I am now, the man, the actor, is a blend of all that has happened'. Yet today his face looks ironed smooth of past troubles, and there are three possible explanations. One is that he is happy, and his new-found domestic stability - in Ireland, with a woman 20 years his junior - has combined with a new-found sobriety to smooth his features. Another possibility is that he is thriving on being back at centre-stage again. 'When you've been away from an audience as long as I have - and it's four years since I was last on stage, in A Month in the Country - you do begin to miss an audience.' A third possibility, offered by Hurt, is that he doesn't buy the view of Beckett as an old miserabilist. And since part of being an actor is selling what you're doing, John Hurt is selling good humour. 'He had to put up with so many misperceptions, poor old Sam. He's got this reputation for being gloomy but he's actually not at all,' he says. When pressed, he concedes that Krapp is a moving play - 'not just touching but seriously moving; it's a whole life; it's everything. The point about Beckett is that his writing is so good that there is only one way to do it. He seems to distil it and distil it until he's got only the finest alcohol left.' In what depths of his own experience does Hurt find a performance that has been described as invaded by pain? 'Heaven knows where it comes from. It wouldn't have occurred to me that I could do it, but then I don't think actors are very good at choosing their own parts,' he says. I had expected him to be tetchy about personal questions but he only looks awkward when he is asked about acting. 'I dread these questions. You see, you can't talk about it. It's an imaginative leap in the end, not an intellectual leap.' Twenty years ago, when he'd just appeared in Alien, in which his stomach had ripped open to produce a monster, an American reporter asked if he was a method actor. Hurt tore open his shirt to reveal an appendicitis scar, and snarled: 'Listen, if Robert De Niro can put on a few pounds...' Actually, he says, 'Though I've been quoted as saying I don't like method acting, what I don't like is when acting becomes therapy. I find that troublesome.' As he says it, he gives a glimpse of the quiet fretfulness that infused his portrayal of the lonely writer Giles De'Ath in his recent film, Love and Death on Long Island. Besotted with a Hollywood teen idol, and besieged by technology, his features seemed to play obsession like a piano: now tragic, now absurd, now magnificently selfish. He can pack a whole emotional universe into the twitch of an eyebrow, a sardonic slackening of the mouth. It is a performance so compelling, so 'real' that I find myself wondering whether Hurt is obsessive; whether, unlike De'Ath, he can handle a video or a fax machine. This is the irony that has dogged Hurt's career: he is not the sort of heroic actor who annexes roles to his own overwhelming personality. Rather, he is a character actor - 'not,' he says, 'in the American sense of someone who is always the same, but in the English sense of someone who plays characters.' Yet there has been a common thread through three decades of work and 90-odd films - a sense of melancholy, of waste, of self-loathing. It's there in Stephen Ward, the Profumo fall guy of Scandal; it was there in the junkie convict of Midnight Express, in the effete Caligula of I, Claudius and - perhaps most memorably - in The Naked Civil Servant, his TV film based on the autobiography of Quentin Crisp. However accomplished, however technically composed these performances have been, people have always looked for clues to them in his life. He finds this irritating .('I've had people say they had me in mind when they wrote something, and I've always said, 'Which bit of me?''). Yet he has displayed a clumsy genius for allowing his life to hold a mirror up to his art. He has admitted that, while shooting Midnight Express (1978), he got through up to seven bottles of wine a day. After White Mischief (1987), a film about dissolute Kenyan settlers, he and his second wife, Donna, built themselves a mansion in the Kenyan hills and had public spats about his drinking. More troublingly, in the run-up to Champions (1983) - a biopic about the jockey Bob Champion - his long-term partner Marie-Lise was killed in a riding accident. In talking openly and honestly about her death, he allowed it to become a film-marketing dream. Wisely, perhaps, his two young children from his third marriage, which broke down in the mid-90s, have been declared a no-talk zone. He is clearly terrified of endangering his relationship with them. Hurt is as candid as ever about himself, though: 'I suppose I had a reputation as a hellraiser,' he says, 'but it's very odd because I never really was. It's just that I lived very publicly and never pretended to be private. I've always lived in the streets. I still walk everywhere and, of course, I've been drunk like most people have, but I just got unlucky, like I did at school. If ever I did anything wrong, I always got caught.' The trouble began at a prep school in Kent, where Hurt - son of a strict Anglican vicar - was regularly beaten. It followed him into his 20s, when he found himself trapped in a shotgun marriage to an actress who said she was pregnant. The baby didn't materialise and the marriage didn't last. 'Sometimes,' he says, 'life is very difficult to take undiluted.' Then he grins at the Beckettian seriousness of the statement, and becomes gleeful in his reminiscences. 'Oh I've been set up many times - like that famous punch-up after the Bafta ceremony. Really it was a non-incident.

As president of Nacods (the national association of colliery overmen, deputies and shotfirers) from 1980 until his retirement in late 1985, Sampey was involved in virtually every step of the year-long miners' dispute, from its beginning with the closure of the Cortonwood pit in 1984. Along with the general secretary of Nacods, Peter McNestry, he led a key section of the mining industry, albeit with a mere 16,000 members at the time; the role of Nacods as 'pit foremen' was crucial to the conduct of that bitter, desperate and historic dispute. </p> <p>It was Sampey who initiated a compromise that might have settled the strike halfway through and, with hindsight, might perhaps have rescued some rump of an industry that had once been the basis of Britain's vast industrial power. </p> <p>Nacods did not join the national union of mineworkers' strike at the outset, though Sampey felt strong sympathy with the NUM protest and was fiercely critical of the way Sir Ian MacGregor ran the coal board. Many Nacods men refused to cross NUM picket lines; even in the Notts coalfield, where the NUM breakaway refused to strike, Nacods members were uneasy. </p> <p>So Sampey put forward his compromise to Sir Pat Lowry, then chairman of Acas. Its main feature was a new and final stage in the review procedure for all pit closures, including those already listed by the coal board. The new independent review body would take evidence from everyone, including local communities. It was an enterprising initiative and came close to succeeding. </p> <p>Sampey and McNestry felt that the chance of peace lay in their hands and, to force the issue, Nacods leaders decided to join the NUM strike from October 25 1984. They were convinced that neither Mrs Thatcher's government nor MacGregor actually wanted a compromise deal, but were concerned mainly to crush the NUM. The Nacods decision rocked the Conservative cabinet. <br>This was the moment when a compromise deal could have been made. The TUC leaders thought so. So did Acas. Mrs Thatcher's cabinet was split and Sir Ian MacGregor was fearful. But Arthur Scargill and the NUM turned away from Sampey's peace plan, and Nacods leaders then decided to settle separately and call off their strike threat, much to the anguish of the TUC and the Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock, who believed a compromise deal was within reach. <br>Even then Sampey personally tried to persuade MacGregor to meet Scargill in one more 'final' bid to salvage something. But it came to nothing. </p> <p>Sampey came from a long line of miners, and was born in the old mining village of Edlington, which was the home of the now defunct Yorkshire main colliery on the outskirts of Doncaster. He worked in the pit, at the coal face, as had his father before him. For although he was educated at Maltby Grammar School, his family couldn't afford to support him in further education, so he went down the pit at 16. </p> <p>When the second world war broke out, he volunteered for the RAF and became a navigator with coastal and bomber command. After the war, he trained as a pit deputy, returned to Yorkshire main colliery and became deeply involved in trade union and local politics. </p> <p>He was soon a member of the Nacods Yorkshire area executive and, shortly afterwards, of the union's national executive. In the early 50s Sampey was elected to Doncaster town council, before being elected to the newly formed South Yorkshire county council in 1974.

      "byline": "Joanna Moorhead and Diane Taylor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Get thee to a nunnery</strong></p> <p><strong>A letter from a friend set Christine Norden on the path to joining a convent</strong></p> <p>'People often ask me, how did you know? And I always say, when something is right, God makes you know.' A stone's throw from the noise and bustle of London's Marble Arch, 40-year-old Mother Aelred, Adorer of the Sacred Heart, is contemplating the idea of 'becoming' a nun. 'People have these ideas of what a nun is like, and one of the reasons my friends were so shocked at what I was doing was that I didn't seem like their idea of a nun. Some people think a nun is someone who can't cope with life; others that you've been hurt in love or had some terrible trauma. I know some of my friends thought something must have been going on in my life that they didn't know about.'</p> <p>Her home, Tyburn Convent, stands near the site where the Catholic martyrs of the Reformation died on the gallows. But Mother Aelred, then Christine Norden, had never heard of Tyburn when, 12 years ago, she went to visit the London convent's sister house on the outskirts of Sydney in her native Australia.</p> <p>Originally Anglican, at 22 she had converted to Catholicism, scandalising her parents. Now she was about to scandalise them further, by entering a silent and enclosed order of Benedictine nuns. 'It didn't seem right for me at all - I love talking, and I really enjoyed the outdoor life,' she says. 'I'd been to university and done a degree, I'd worked as a personnel officer and I could have carved out a good career for myself. But there was something missing.'</p> <p>Mother Aelred says that as she grew older she realised that, whatever she did with her life, it would have to be done wholeheartedly: 'I knew I'd want to give myself totally to it. And I couldn't find a man, or a career, or anything else that I felt was enough to give myself to totally. Until the convent, and that fateful day.</p> <p>'The only way I could do anything totally was to do it for God. For a while, I thought I'd probably become a missionary or join an active religious order. But then a friend wrote and asked me if I'd considered joining this convent in Sydney which had some connection to a convent in London. And while I was thinking about it, by chance, I read an article in a magazine about the Adorers of the Sacred Heart - it was very strange!'</p> <p>The moment she set foot in the chapel of the Sydney convent, Mother Aelred knew it was right for her. 'I could see the sisters across the chapel praying, and I knew this was the life I yearned for, what God was calling me to do,' she says. 'I went to see the prioress and said that if I'd had no commitments I'd join them. And she said, do you mean that? Because if you want to, you can.</p> <p>'I couldn't believe it could be so simple - that I really could take this step. But knowing it could happen didn't deter me at all - I wasn't scared; I was absolutely certain this was the right thing.' Despite the protestations of her family and friends she decided against sitting the final exams in the nursing course she had been taking.</p> <p>'They thought that if the convent didn't work out, I'd at least have finished the course - but I didn't need that kind of insurance policy, I knew it would work out,' she says. Four weeks after her first visit, having sold her car and given all her possessions away to friends, Christine was back on the convent doorstep. She left behind a deeply hurt mother and an angry father, but she has since been reconciled with her parents. And her friends were just incredulous.</p> <p>'The reaction of the friends I told was interesting: they basically divided into two camps. The first were so amazed they never mentioned it again, and the other group were fascinated and they just asked me questions all the time. But most of them thought, give her a fortnight - she'll be back.'</p> <p>Despite being on the other side of the world from many of her friends, Mother Aelred still corresponds with some of them. 'A lot of people I've known keep in touch - and they're not all churchgoers. I hear from people who have no belief, and often they ask me what I think of something or what I'd do if I were them.'</p> <p>The life Christine embraced is, by any standards, an austere one - and radically different from her previous existence. 'When I first entered the order I wore ordinary clothes, but eight months on I was clothed in my habit. Instead of the jeans and shorts I'd always worn, I was in this thick, long habit and veil,' she says.</p> <p>There was no television to watch, no lie-ins to relish - the nuns rise at 5am - and the independent life she had led before was exchanged for the strict rules of a religious order. The level of obedience expected from the nuns is so great that seven years ago, Mother Aelred was summoned to be told she was being transferred from Sydney to her order's mother house at Marble Arch, where she remains today.</p> <p>Has she, for even a moment, regretted her decision? She is laughing before the question is out: she cannot contemplate regret in the context of this decision. 'I'm not saying it's always easy, living here with 18 other women and my family on the other side of the world, but what we are doing here is giving witness to the Gospel values. We are a little oasis of prayer in the midst of a big city, and we mean a lot to a lot of people.' </p> <p><strong>Downshift</strong></p> <p><strong>From restaurant chef to environmental activist</strong></p> <p>All her life, Joyce Hambling has loved food. Wooed by its luscious variety of textures, flavours and colours, she chose a career in restaurants, first as a waitress and later as a chef. Jobs in high-profile establishments such as London's L'Escargot nurtured this love, and five years ago she decided to become a self- employed caterer.</p> <p>Prestigious contracts to provide food for events such as London Fashion Week followed. Then Greenpeace asked her to cook for them. 'I can only describe what happened as a road-to-Damascus conversion. My first thought when I got the Greenpeace contract was that they would look good on my client list. I had always thought of food in terms of its gorgeousness - how much olive oil you could throw at a dish, that sort of thing.'</p> <p>Towards the end of 1996, Greenpeace environmental campaigners were involved in blockading the port of Liverpool to prevent the first genetically modified crops coming into the UK. 'I decided to find out a bit more about why they were doing this, and read an article in Guardian Weekend about the possibilities of growing oranges in Scotland and mange tout in Manchester if these foods were genetically modified to flourish in an alien climate. At first, having been brought up in an age of scientific discoveries, I thought wow, but by the end of the article I was saying, 'Oh, my God, what would that mean for countries in east Africa who have moved away from what they used to grow traditionally so they could have an export crop?' 'It suddenly occurred to me that I couldn't let these Greenpeace campaigners blockade while I just cooked their lunch. I felt that if I didn't make a stand too there would be nothing left to cook with.'</p> <p>What she describes as 'a steep learning curve' followed. She became involved in the Genetic Engineering Network, a loose coalition of people and groups sharing information about genetic engineering. She has abandoned her catering business to work for them full time, collating news and email lists. The job has not been funded, so at the moment she has no salary. 'I've lost all my muscle tone because I no longer rush around carrying huge sacks of potatoes - instead I'm sitting at a desk reading through all this material. I read much more than I used to and always want to know the other side of the story.'</p> <p>Aside from her passionate commitment to the campaign, Hambling, 35, believes the new way of working has liberated her. 'I'm free of all that 'I've worked an extra 15 minutes so that's an extra \u00a33.20' stuff.' Even the luxuries she used to enjoy, such as grabbing a taxi, taking a friend out to dinner or buying a new pair of shoes, she has happily forgone.</p> <p>'My change in direction has made all sorts of differences. I used to be the sort of person who would wear matching lipstick and nail varnish, but now I don't even know where my last dried-out mascara is. Some people think I've taken on sainthood and others think I've joined the ALF. 'The only trouble is that I'm in danger of becoming a bit boring because I love what I do so much and think about it all the time. Let's face it, there aren't many people who want to talk about intellectual property rights when they go to a party.</p> <p><strong>Upshift</strong></p> <p><strong>Sara Denver, nurse turned solicitor</strong></p> <p>At the age of 18, Sara Denver set her heart on becoming a nurse and embarked on almost four years of training - first a degree, then a course to specialise in cardiothoracic intensive care. 'I loved my job, I was doing something practical and I enjoyed working with people.' After spending such a long time training, it never occurred to her that she would want to change, particularly to a career which would involve an even longer period of study. But a chance conversation with a disaffected doctor who had decided to jettison medicine in favour of law had a profound effect on her.</p> <p>She began to find out as much as she could about training and what a job as a solicitor would entail. 'I wanted to find out as much as I could, as once you've left a career it's quite hard to go back to it.'</p> <p>Research completed, she decided that law would suit her perfectly. And she hoped that when she qualified she would be able to use some of her skills gained in the NHS to specialise in medical negligence cases. Another protracted training stint followed - this time for five years - with a one-year law conversion course then two years of legal practice and finally a two-year training contract with a firm of solicitors.</p> <p>'I qualified in September and it feels great. I loved the challenge of studying for something new; law was something I really wanted to do for myself but at the same time I think I've chosen something useful.'</p> <p>While she doesn't know of many lawyers who have changed career direction, Denver, 32, can think of many colleagues from medicine who are now doing different jobs.</p> <p>She says an increasing number of medical negligence cases are being taken out, which means an abundant supply of work is likely. 'I don't know whether the incidences of negligence are increasing or whether people are becoming more aware of legal action as an option.'</p> <p>She is certain there won't be any more lightning career changes. 'This is it now. I'm so much happier in this career; I feel I can really make a difference to people. I would recommend changing direction to anyone. Explore the options thoroughly, but don't be afraid of change.'</p>",

'People have these ideas of what a nun is like, and one of the reasons my friends were so shocked at what I was doing was that I didn't seem like their idea of a nun. Some people think a nun is someone who can't cope with life; others that you've been hurt in love or had some terrible trauma. I know some of my friends thought something must have been going on in my life that they didn't know about.' Her home, Tyburn Convent, stands near the site where the Catholic martyrs of the Reformation died on the gallows. But Mother Aelred, then Christine Norden, had never heard of Tyburn when, 12 years ago, she went to visit the London convent's sister house on the outskirts of Sydney in her native Australia. Originally Anglican, at 22 she had converted to Catholicism, scandalising her parents. Now she was about to scandalise them further, by entering a silent and enclosed order of Benedictine nuns. 'It didn't seem right for me at all - I love talking, and I really enjoyed the outdoor life,' she says. 'I'd been to university and done a degree, I'd worked as a personnel officer and I could have carved out a good career for myself. But there was something missing.' Mother Aelred says that as she grew older she realised that, whatever she did with her life, it would have to be done wholeheartedly: 'I knew I'd want to give myself totally to it. And I couldn't find a man, or a career, or anything else that I felt was enough to give myself to totally. Until the convent, and that fateful day. 'The only way I could do anything totally was to do it for God. For a while, I thought I'd probably become a missionary or join an active religious order. But then a friend wrote and asked me if I'd considered joining this convent in Sydney which had some connection to a convent in London. And while I was thinking about it, by chance, I read an article in a magazine about the Adorers of the Sacred Heart - it was very strange!' The moment she set foot in the chapel of the Sydney convent, Mother Aelred knew it was right for her. 'I could see the sisters across the chapel praying, and I knew this was the life I yearned for, what God was calling me to do,' she says. 'I went to see the prioress and said that if I'd had no commitments I'd join them. And she said, do you mean that? Because if you want to, you can. 'I couldn't believe it could be so simple - that I really could take this step. But knowing it could happen didn't deter me at all - I wasn't scared; I was absolutely certain this was the right thing.' Despite the protestations of her family and friends she decided against sitting the final exams in the nursing course she had been taking. 'They thought that if the convent didn't work out, I'd at least have finished the course - but I didn't need that kind of insurance policy, I knew it would work out,' she says. Four weeks after her first visit, having sold her car and given all her possessions away to friends, Christine was back on the convent doorstep. She left behind a deeply hurt mother and an angry father, but she has since been reconciled with her parents. And her friends were just incredulous. 'The reaction of the friends I told was interesting: they basically divided into two camps. The first were so amazed they never mentioned it again, and the other group were fascinated and they just asked me questions all the time. But most of them thought, give her a fortnight - she'll be back.' Despite being on the other side of the world from many of her friends, Mother Aelred still corresponds with some of them. 'A lot of people I've known keep in touch - and they're not all churchgoers. I hear from people who have no belief, and often they ask me what I think of something or what I'd do if I were them.' The life Christine embraced is, by any standards, an austere one - and radically different from her previous existence. 'When I first entered the order I wore ordinary clothes, but eight months on I was clothed in my habit. Instead of the jeans and shorts I'd always worn, I was in this thick, long habit and veil,' she says. There was no television to watch, no lie-ins to relish - the nuns rise at 5am - and the independent life she had led before was exchanged for the strict rules of a religious order. The level of obedience expected from the nuns is so great that seven years ago, Mother Aelred was summoned to be told she was being transferred from Sydney to her order's mother house at Marble Arch, where she remains today. Has she, for even a moment, regretted her decision? She is laughing before the question is out: she cannot contemplate regret in the context of this decision. 'I'm not saying it's always easy, living here with 18 other women and my family on the other side of the world, but what we are doing here is giving witness to the Gospel values. We are a little oasis of prayer in the midst of a big city, and we mean a lot to a lot of people.' Downshift From restaurant chef to environmental activist All her life, Joyce Hambling has loved food. Wooed by its luscious variety of textures, flavours and colours, she chose a career in restaurants, first as a waitress and later as a chef. Jobs in high-profile establishments such as London's L'Escargot nurtured this love, and five years ago she decided to become a self- employed caterer. Prestigious contracts to provide food for events such as London Fashion Week followed. Then Greenpeace asked her to cook for them. 'I can only describe what happened as a road-to-Damascus conversion. My first thought when I got the Greenpeace contract was that they would look good on my client list. I had always thought of food in terms of its gorgeousness - how much olive oil you could throw at a dish, that sort of thing.' Towards the end of 1996, Greenpeace environmental campaigners were involved in blockading the port of Liverpool to prevent the first genetically modified crops coming into the UK. 'I decided to find out a bit more about why they were doing this, and read an article in Guardian Weekend about the possibilities of growing oranges in Scotland and mange tout in Manchester if these foods were genetically modified to flourish in an alien climate. At first, having been brought up in an age of scientific discoveries, I thought wow, but by the end of the article I was saying, 'Oh, my God, what would that mean for countries in east Africa who have moved away from what they used to grow traditionally so they could have an export crop?' 'It suddenly occurred to me that I couldn't let these Greenpeace campaigners blockade while I just cooked their lunch. I felt that if I didn't make a stand too there would be nothing left to cook with.' What she describes as 'a steep learning curve' followed. She became involved in the Genetic Engineering Network, a loose coalition of people and groups sharing information about genetic engineering. She has abandoned her catering business to work for them full time, collating news and email lists. The job has not been funded, so at the moment she has no salary. 'I've lost all my muscle tone because I no longer rush around carrying huge sacks of potatoes - instead I'm sitting at a desk reading through all this material. I read much more than I used to and always want to know the other side of the story.' Aside from her passionate commitment to the campaign, Hambling, 35, believes the new way of working has liberated her. 'I'm free of all that 'I've worked an extra 15 minutes so that's an extra \u00a33.20' stuff.' Even the luxuries she used to enjoy, such as grabbing a taxi, taking a friend out to dinner or buying a new pair of shoes, she has happily forgone. 'My change in direction has made all sorts of differences. I used to be the sort of person who would wear matching lipstick and nail varnish, but now I don't even know where my last dried-out mascara is. Some people think I've taken on sainthood and others think I've joined the ALF. 'The only trouble is that I'm in danger of becoming a bit boring because I love what I do so much and think about it all the time. Let's face it, there aren't many people who want to talk about intellectual property rights when they go to a party. Upshift Sara Denver, nurse turned solicitor At the age of 18, Sara Denver set her heart on becoming a nurse and embarked on almost four years of training - first a degree, then a course to specialise in cardiothoracic intensive care. 'I loved my job, I was doing something practical and I enjoyed working with people.' After spending such a long time training, it never occurred to her that she would want to change, particularly to a career which would involve an even longer period of study. But a chance conversation with a disaffected doctor who had decided to jettison medicine in favour of law had a profound effect on her. She began to find out as much as she could about training and what a job as a solicitor would entail. 'I wanted to find out as much as I could, as once you've left a career it's quite hard to go back to it.' Research completed, she decided that law would suit her perfectly. And she hoped that when she qualified she would be able to use some of her skills gained in the NHS to specialise in medical negligence cases. Another protracted training stint followed - this time for five years - with a one-year law conversion course then two years of legal practice and finally a two-year training contract with a firm of solicitors. 'I qualified in September and it feels great. I loved the challenge of studying for something new; law was something I really wanted to do for myself but at the same time I think I've chosen something useful.' While she doesn't know of many lawyers who have changed career direction, Denver, 32, can think of many colleagues from medicine who are now doing different jobs. She says an increasing number of medical negligence cases are being taken out, which means an abundant supply of work is likely. 'I don't know whether the incidences of negligence are increasing or whether people are becoming more aware of legal action as an option.' She is certain there won't be any more lightning career changes. 'This is it now. I'm so much happier in this career; I feel I can really make a difference to people. I would recommend changing direction to anyone. Explore the options thoroughly, but don't be afraid of change.'",

      "trailText": "<p>'Think of this show as an ornamental glass of eggnog being poured from a bowl of happiness,' Jackie Clune tells us. She has bounced on stage in a nifty white PVC number, backed up by her two male dancers, and swung into the first Christmas number (Yulesville or Bust) before we even know where we are. Kick, turn, and off to the Christmas log cabin ('I kept the builders up all night to get this ready: ooh my lips were chapped in the morning'). Welcome to the familiar innuendo-filled world of pantomime.  Clune crosses Christmas with her own brand of off-off-West End theatre, paying homage to Abba, James Bond, All Saints and, most importantly of all, herself. The songs are sharp and funny, though some of the surrounding material a bit less so. For the first half some of her gags seem a little tired or misplaced: it is not until just before the interval, and then for the much tighter second half that we feel completely Cluned up.  That is probably where that slight edge comes from: sometimes, when Clune is talking herself up, or down, we are not sure how to take her. She spends half the time making jokes about exhausting men, and the other half telling Richard Whiteley (who calls her up during the show, although we suspect it may be recorded - no, really) to stop pestering her: 'I'm a lesbian, I've told you before.' After Clune's This is Your Life (featuring Mel and Sue coming out of the shower cabinet) and her very own fly-on-the-wall documentary, we make up our minds that though she may be a bit of a cow, she is our kind of cow, the kind of cow you would like to spend a night in the pub with, picking everyone in the room apart.</p>",
