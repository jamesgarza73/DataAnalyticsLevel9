      "body": "<p>Chelsea were a curious mixture here, not least because they fielded as many as four Englishmen. They opened with some unworldly touches by the silver-booted George Weah and finished with impressive gusto. In between, the multinationals muddled along. </p> <p>Aston Villa manfully tried to fill in the gaps with a rejuvenated Paul Merson increasingly imposing his creative abilities on the match. It was a measure of Villa's own rehabilitation that he and his colleagues treated this draw almost like a defeat afterwards. They should not be disheartened; more important games lie ahead. </p> <p>However much Gianluca Vialli and, more improbably, John Gregory press for a European place via a high league placing, it is knockout silverware that is really exercising their minds. Villa and Chelsea have a common enemy - Leicester - and, if this dread- nought can be outmanoeuvred, Wembley beckons. </p> <p>On this evidence Chelsea will be relying as much on Weah, who is eligible for Sunday's FA Cup tie, as Villa do on Merson for progress. The first full pairing of Liberian and \u00a310m signing could not be deemed a success. Chris Sutton was substituted after 74 minutes but not before Weah, on more than one occasion, pointed to the ground only to see his co-striker respond by lofting the ball vaguely in his direction. </p> <p>The reborn Merson may now have to become Renaissance Man since Villa's shortage of strikers points to an out-and-out attacking role in the Worthington semi-final first leg against Leicester tomorrow night. Here he produced virtually all Villa's opportunities with crosses and free-kicks, quite apart from his side's most enterprising moment when he chipped Emerson Thome with one foot and then volleyed just over with the other. </p> <p>Merson, according to Gregory, is now coming off the pitch \"with nothing left in the tank\" - but for all the right reasons. \"He's been totally committed - his fitness level is up - and reminded me that he's first choice. And he's cer tainly commanded a lot of respect in the dressing room for the way he's playing.\" </p> <p>One of several curving free-kicks from Merson offered Villa's best opportunity, an unchallenged header squandered by Ugo Ehiogu after 75 minutes. Much earlier Merson induced panic in Chelsea's penalty area that ultimately saw the impressive Jon Harley clear off the line before Benito Carbone shot wildly. </p> <p>But no one, not even Merson, could match Weah's early silver standard. On one occasion the Liberian appeared to defy geometry in turning past George Boateng; then he demonstrated an extraordinary feat of dexterity to outmanoeuvre the bewildered Ehiogu before grazing a post. </p> <p>Chelsea threw on Tore Andre Flo and Gianfranco Zola but the last word almost lay with Weah. A twisting back-header brought an equally agile tip-over from David James, who then matched the save from his point-blank shot. Weah is not yet match-fit but, ominously, he says: \"I'm getting there. I think I'm going to have a very good time in England.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea were a curious mixture here, not least because they fielded as many as four Englishmen. They opened with some unworldly touches by the silver-booted George Weah and finished with impressive gusto. In between, the multinationals muddled along. Aston Villa manfully tried to fill in the gaps with a rejuvenated Paul Merson increasingly imposing his creative abilities on the match. It was a measure of Villa's own rehabilitation that he and his colleagues treated this draw almost like a defeat afterwards. They should not be disheartened; more important games lie ahead. However much Gianluca Vialli and, more improbably, John Gregory press for a European place via a high league placing, it is knockout silverware that is really exercising their minds. Villa and Chelsea have a common enemy - Leicester - and, if this dread- nought can be outmanoeuvred, Wembley beckons. On this evidence Chelsea will be relying as much on Weah, who is eligible for Sunday's FA Cup tie, as Villa do on Merson for progress. The first full pairing of Liberian and \u00a310m signing could not be deemed a success. Chris Sutton was substituted after 74 minutes but not before Weah, on more than one occasion, pointed to the ground only to see his co-striker respond by lofting the ball vaguely in his direction. The reborn Merson may now have to become Renaissance Man since Villa's shortage of strikers points to an out-and-out attacking role in the Worthington semi-final first leg against Leicester tomorrow night. Here he produced virtually all Villa's opportunities with crosses and free-kicks, quite apart from his side's most enterprising moment when he chipped Emerson Thome with one foot and then volleyed just over with the other. Merson, according to Gregory, is now coming off the pitch \"with nothing left in the tank\" - but for all the right reasons. \"He's been totally committed - his fitness level is up - and reminded me that he's first choice. And he's cer tainly commanded a lot of respect in the dressing room for the way he's playing.\" One of several curving free-kicks from Merson offered Villa's best opportunity, an unchallenged header squandered by Ugo Ehiogu after 75 minutes. Much earlier Merson induced panic in Chelsea's penalty area that ultimately saw the impressive Jon Harley clear off the line before Benito Carbone shot wildly. But no one, not even Merson, could match Weah's early silver standard. On one occasion the Liberian appeared to defy geometry in turning past George Boateng; then he demonstrated an extraordinary feat of dexterity to outmanoeuvre the bewildered Ehiogu before grazing a post. Chelsea threw on Tore Andre Flo and Gianfranco Zola but the last word almost lay with Weah. A twisting back-header brought an equally agile tip-over from David James, who then matched the save from his point-blank shot. Weah is not yet match-fit but, ominously, he says: \"I'm getting there. I think I'm going to have a very good time in England.\"",

Does anybody know of someone who can score us a goal?\" </p> <p>Owen's problems apart, only the ever-present possibility of Paul Ince being sent off on his rather unwelcome return to Merseyside kept the punters awake. </p> <p>Ince's lack of grace after he was thrown out of Liverpool last summer was astonishing - he called for Houllier to be sacked - but he is now a player in sharp decline. </p> <p>Even so, Ince enjoyed the game's only clear-cut chance. After being released by Juninho, he should have gone on to score but, believing he was offside, he hesitated, allowing Sander Westerveld to save with his feet.</p>",

Clearly, all is not well and the possibility of Owen returning to Munich for the laying on of sports injury specialist Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt's healing hands cannot be discounted. Certainly, his chances of playing for his country in next month's friendly against Argentina are slim. Owen had intensive treatment at Liverpool's training ground yesterday and will be looked at again today. He was actually better off out of this morass of incompetence, for Liverpool could have played for ever and a day and still not found a way through Middlesbrough's smartly drilled defence. As Houllier lamented: \"We have had our two main strikers - Robbie Fowler and Michael - for only 60 minutes this season. Does anybody know of someone who can score us a goal?\" Owen's problems apart, only the ever-present possibility of Paul Ince being sent off on his rather unwelcome return to Merseyside kept the punters awake. Ince's lack of grace after he was thrown out of Liverpool last summer was astonishing - he called for Houllier to be sacked - but he is now a player in sharp decline. Even so, Ince enjoyed the game's only clear-cut chance. After being released by Juninho, he should have gone on to score but, believing he was offside, he hesitated, allowing Sander Westerveld to save with his feet.",

Paul Miller pulled one back for Lincoln on the restart but Warren Hackett and John Doolan gave Barnet the points before Tony Battersby's late penalty consolation. Hartlepool and Northampton kept up with the leaders, Tommy Miller's 53rd-minute goal giving Hartlepool a 1-0 win over Carlisle and Northampton eventually overcoming the bottom club Chester. Ally Pickering's second-minute goal gave Chester's new manager Ian Atkins hope of an upset against his old club, but Steve Howard equalised in the 31st minute before Ian Sampson and Carlo Corazzin gave Northampton a 3-1 win. The fastest goal on Saturday was scored by Hull City's Jamaican international Theodore Whitmore after 35 seconds of the 1-1 home draw with Cheltenham.",

      "body": "<p>The people on Barking Road are going somewhere. A black woman with a bundle of clothes is padding down to the Laundromat. A guy with drink on his breath is trying to sell a watch. The people in the taxi office are talking into mobile phones. They are making plans for later. The street buses on their way to Stratford and Plaistow come rolling past with people on the top decks deep into novels or the evening paper.</p> <p>Darryl Fuller is taking up a little corner at Community Links in the old town hall. He sits, smiling, at the end of a group of chairs. This is his classroom. He was born on November 2 1983 in Forest Gate Hospital. When he tries to remember all the houses he has lived in he comes up with a flurry of names: Shaftesbury Road, Upton Park, the Isle of Dogs, Poplar and Beckton, where he lives now with his dad, who is 36, his mother, who is 34, a sister called Sinead, and brothers Daniel and Ricky. They live in a four-bedroom house with a dog called Chloe. He says when he thinks about it he isn't sure if his mum's 34. \"I don't like to ask.\" He doesn't know if the house they live in is rented or bought.</p> <p>Darryl's first memory is of being five years old. He was walking down the street and he looked over at some girls and then crashed into a lamp post. The first school he went to was St Stephen's, in Green Street. He was excluded after a year. Darryl looks into space when he is trying to remember things. \"Some kid wanted to fight me and I just stuck him,\" he says. Then he went to another school in Shaftesbury Road. He was there three weeks, he says, when an Asian kid pulled a knife on him. The kid with the knife was aged 10. Darryl kicked the knife out of his hand and then punched him out. Around then Darryl's mum had another kid and they all moved to a bigger house on the Isle of Dogs. He talks about gangs bullying his sister and he couldn't stand it so he \"flipped\".</p> <p>\"What happens when you flip?\"</p> <p>\"One minute I was all calm,\" he says, \"and then I turned and I'm out of control. I just don't know what'll happen then. It's always fists - if you can't fight with your fists you can't fight at all. I get mad if someone insults my mum or attacks my sister. I search for people who do that.\"</p> <p>Darryl was 10 when they moved to Beckton. He got expelled from North Beckton School and was later allowed back in. Then he went to Brampton Manor and in the first year he was excluded for fighting. They allowed him back in, but he started fighting again and was out by the second year. \"By that time,\" he says, \"I was having fights just every other month. At the same time in my life I started bunking. I bunked nearly the whole of my third year and when I was 15 they asked me to leave.\"</p> <p>\"Did you have friends?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. Virtually the whole school.\"</p> <p>\"Was there anything you liked about school?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. Football. Pottery. Do you want to see my lessons?\"</p> <p>Darryl's doing a thing just now about the different spellings and meanings of words that sound the same. It's all written down in sheets in his folder.</p> <p>\"When you have toothache you have . . . pain.\"</p> <p>\"A sheet of glass in a window is a . . . pane.\"</p> <p>\"White, or having a colourless face . . . pale.\"</p> <p>\"A bucket . . . pail.\"</p> <p>On the arithmetic pages he has shown himself able to add 13 and 34 to make 47. This year he can multiply five by five to make 25. And he can make sense of the proposition that when seven people eat three bars of chocolate each, then altogether they ate 21 bars.</p> <p>Darryl likes the idea of everything about him being known and written down.</p> <p>He is the British Male at 16. Or is he just one of them? His star sign is Scorpio. He is right-handed. People he tries to avoid are Liz, Bob, Gary and Danny. He likes to watch Coronation Street, EastEnders, championship wrestling, South Park, a music channel called The Box and tons of movies. He is brilliant at Nintendo. There's a PlayStation game he likes called Knockabout Kings. It's a boxing game. \"It's quite hard. I'm the WBA champion undefeated,\" he says. Not only that, but he's brilliant as well at Tekken - a fighting game.</p> <p>\"I expect you are.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. I'm brilliant. I like violent games. I've beat everyone there is down my street.\"</p> <p>One time, one of the teachers at one of the schools asked him to come in and play drums at assembly. \"It was brilliant,\" he says. He would love to have a drum kit of his own and he and some of his friends have been trying to fix up a band. His friend Danny's in the band. He doesn't say anything about Danny being one of his people to avoid.</p> <p>He records cool songs off the radio and off the music show on cable. \"Some people say I'm all right on the drums,\" he says. West Ham United is his football team. A guy called Denver takes him and some of his mates for football practice down at the ground every Wednesday. Three hours every time. \"It's brilliant,\" says Darryl, \"I'm a striker. We've had a good start to the season but now we're playing crap.\"</p> <p>\"You mean West Ham?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah.\"</p> <p>Darryl says the prime minister is called John Blair, or something. When he thinks of what he'd like to do if he was in charge of the country, he says right away that he'd stop racism. He hates drugs as well, he says. \"I have a chance to play for Leyton Orient. I'm trying to calm down and if you do that [drugs], you know what'll happen. It'd be impossible to get rid of drugs but I'd like to. I've got a mate who takes drugs and he just looks so ill.\"</p> <p>\"Are you really not interested in drugs?\"</p> <p>\"No way,\" he says, \"they're for mugs.\" He smiles.</p> <p>He paused for ages before saying the third thing he'd do if he ruled the country. \"I know,\" he says, \"I would sort charity out. If people need help they should get it - you know - support and that.\"</p> <p>Listening to Darryl, you find yourself able both to admire him and to worry. He lives in a precarious personal world. He is only beginning to know what he can trust; he is only beginning to want to be trustworthy. No one would find Darryl an impossible proposition now: he is growing up likeable, with more personality than charm, and more charm than free-floating anger.</p> <p>He needs only to be talked away from his difficult traits: given lessons, a football coach, a number of small tasks, a weekend job at the Booker cash-and-carry. He needs to be part of something that is slightly bigger than he is himself. At Community Links, on Barking Road, something of the sort has gripped him. The only worry is, can he stick it?</p> <p>On a typical day, Darryl is woken by his mum at 9am. He gets washed and might eat something, and if his mum's busy he'll iron his own shirt. Then he cycles to Community Links, where he learns the difference between \"pain\" and \"pane\", and where there's an environment that allows him to feel he's going somewhere. He also does odd jobs around the building - \"helping old people downstairs with their tea and that\" - and he sees the time just rolling away with all he's got to do now. \"People up here got respect for me,\" he says. \"They leave me to get on with my work. I get on with everybody now.\"</p> <p>Darryl says he can't think of anyone to blame about his schooldays. He says if he's honest it was him. \"I'm young,\" he says, \"I don't know how my life will go. I just want nothing bad to happen. I just want to be myself.\" He sometimes gets frustrated because he wants things to go faster. He has learned a lot more than he ever did at school, though. There are only six or seven people in his class at Community Links.</p> <p>He's been on planes. He went to Lourdes with some folk who couldn't walk. Darryl doesn't go to church but his mum goes. If he had to die for anything, then he thinks it should be his family. His heroes are his mum and his dad and his nan. He'd like to have a silver Porsche Boxster Turbo. He has no fear of cars, even though he was in a crash once, with his dad. Fifteen stitches in his head. It was somebody else's fault: they jumped the lights.</p> <p>He's not going steady with a girl but he has a few girlfriends he sees all the time. He says that girls admire him for the muscles on his stomach although he doesn't even work out.</p> <p>Outside the strip-lighted classroom other people are coming into the building for classes and meetings and coffee and tea. You can hear music starting up for a dance class downstairs. All over the place the sense rises up of an effort being made; a sense of things being overcome and time being invested. The sound of laughter travels up the stairs and along the corridor.</p> <p>For money Darryl relies on his mum. She gives him a few quid here and there. So does his dad. But one of these days he's going to get a part-time job at Booker in Beckton; he would like it if he could have more money for drums or clothes or that Porsche Boxster Turbo.</p> <p>He is wearing a light green Ben Sherman shirt. He is very pleased with his hooded top from Paul Smith. His trousers cost 60 quid. His favourite shoes are Kickers and the ones he is wearing are brown and comfy. He wears white socks and he thinks that socks are important. His brown hair is cut into a kind of wedge but he says it's not a wedge, it's called curtains.</p> <p>Darryl sticks his tongue out when he makes a joke. When you ask him what he thinks of the police he begins to look a bit shifty. \"They do their job don't they, but I hate the way they pull up my mates just 'cos they've got bald heads.\" He used to have a bald head himself, but then he got into the pop singer Peter Andre who has hair hanging over his face: curtains.</p> <p>\"I feel quite sorted out in my head,\" he says. \"If I wanted to be a gangster I'd know what to do. But I don't want that. Not now. I don't get off on knowing villains or anything.\"</p> <p>He slumps in the chair, smiles in a lop-sided way, and looks around the room where he says good things have happened for him. \"I'd like to have a family some day,\" he says.</p> <p>Darryl's eyes are hazel. He is five foot five. He is 16 years old and proud of it, thank you. His favourite colour is claret. He walks down the stairs of Community Links smiling at every one and making jokes. The last I see of him, he picks up his bike and wheels it towards the doors. It is dark outside. He smiles a big smile as he hops on his bike and heads into Barking Road. Like the rest of the world out there, he is at his best with somewhere to go.</p> <p>On the way out I look at a piece of paper. It carries the words of Betty Young, an 86-year-old woman who helped set up Community Links at an East Ham shop in 1978. \"The shop was damp and it smelt of coal tar from when the chemist used to be there,\" she said.</p> <p>\"There was always boys there, at first three and then more, boys who should have been at school. I know some of them were in trouble but they were always good to me. Gradually we got things going. I remember thinking, I've seen a lot of bad things but this is a good.\"</p> <p>The 86-year-old's words - on a cold night last October - seemed almost to propel the British Male at 16 on his way up Barking Road.</p> <p>\u0095This article was taken from What if . . ? 15 Visions of Change for Britain's Inner Cities, which is published by Short Books today, priced \u00a35.99.

I just don't know what'll happen then. It's always fists - if you can't fight with your fists you can't fight at all. I get mad if someone insults my mum or attacks my sister. I search for people who do that.\" Darryl was 10 when they moved to Beckton. He got expelled from North Beckton School and was later allowed back in. Then he went to Brampton Manor and in the first year he was excluded for fighting. They allowed him back in, but he started fighting again and was out by the second year. \"By that time,\" he says, \"I was having fights just every other month. At the same time in my life I started bunking. I bunked nearly the whole of my third year and when I was 15 they asked me to leave.\" \"Did you have friends?\" \"Yeah. Virtually the whole school.\" \"Was there anything you liked about school?\" \"Yeah. Football. Pottery. Do you want to see my lessons?\" Darryl's doing a thing just now about the different spellings and meanings of words that sound the same. It's all written down in sheets in his folder. \"When you have toothache you have . . . pain.\" \"A sheet of glass in a window is a . . . pane.\" \"White, or having a colourless face . . . pale.\" \"A bucket . . . pail.\" On the arithmetic pages he has shown himself able to add 13 and 34 to make 47. This year he can multiply five by five to make 25. And he can make sense of the proposition that when seven people eat three bars of chocolate each, then altogether they ate 21 bars. Darryl likes the idea of everything about him being known and written down. He is the British Male at 16. Or is he just one of them? His star sign is Scorpio. He is right-handed. People he tries to avoid are Liz, Bob, Gary and Danny. He likes to watch Coronation Street, EastEnders, championship wrestling, South Park, a music channel called The Box and tons of movies. He is brilliant at Nintendo. There's a PlayStation game he likes called Knockabout Kings. It's a boxing game. \"It's quite hard. I'm the WBA champion undefeated,\" he says. Not only that, but he's brilliant as well at Tekken - a fighting game. \"I expect you are.\" \"Yeah. I'm brilliant. I like violent games. I've beat everyone there is down my street.\" One time, one of the teachers at one of the schools asked him to come in and play drums at assembly. \"It was brilliant,\" he says. He would love to have a drum kit of his own and he and some of his friends have been trying to fix up a band. His friend Danny's in the band. He doesn't say anything about Danny being one of his people to avoid. He records cool songs off the radio and off the music show on cable. \"Some people say I'm all right on the drums,\" he says. West Ham United is his football team. A guy called Denver takes him and some of his mates for football practice down at the ground every Wednesday. Three hours every time. \"It's brilliant,\" says Darryl, \"I'm a striker. We've had a good start to the season but now we're playing crap.\" \"You mean West Ham?\" \"Yeah.\" Darryl says the prime minister is called John Blair, or something. When he thinks of what he'd like to do if he was in charge of the country, he says right away that he'd stop racism. He hates drugs as well, he says. \"I have a chance to play for Leyton Orient. I'm trying to calm down and if you do that [drugs], you know what'll happen. It'd be impossible to get rid of drugs but I'd like to. I've got a mate who takes drugs and he just looks so ill.\" \"Are you really not interested in drugs?\" \"No way,\" he says, \"they're for mugs.\" He smiles. He paused for ages before saying the third thing he'd do if he ruled the country. \"I know,\" he says, \"I would sort charity out. If people need help they should get it - you know - support and that.\" Listening to Darryl, you find yourself able both to admire him and to worry. He lives in a precarious personal world. He is only beginning to know what he can trust; he is only beginning to want to be trustworthy. No one would find Darryl an impossible proposition now: he is growing up likeable, with more personality than charm, and more charm than free-floating anger. He needs only to be talked away from his difficult traits: given lessons, a football coach, a number of small tasks, a weekend job at the Booker cash-and-carry. He needs to be part of something that is slightly bigger than he is himself. At Community Links, on Barking Road, something of the sort has gripped him. The only worry is, can he stick it? On a typical day, Darryl is woken by his mum at 9am. He gets washed and might eat something, and if his mum's busy he'll iron his own shirt. Then he cycles to Community Links, where he learns the difference between \"pain\" and \"pane\", and where there's an environment that allows him to feel he's going somewhere. He also does odd jobs around the building - \"helping old people downstairs with their tea and that\" - and he sees the time just rolling away with all he's got to do now. \"People up here got respect for me,\" he says. \"They leave me to get on with my work. I get on with everybody now.\" Darryl says he can't think of anyone to blame about his schooldays. He says if he's honest it was him. \"I'm young,\" he says, \"I don't know how my life will go. I just want nothing bad to happen. I just want to be myself.\" He sometimes gets frustrated because he wants things to go faster. He has learned a lot more than he ever did at school, though. There are only six or seven people in his class at Community Links. He's been on planes. He went to Lourdes with some folk who couldn't walk. Darryl doesn't go to church but his mum goes. If he had to die for anything, then he thinks it should be his family. His heroes are his mum and his dad and his nan. He'd like to have a silver Porsche Boxster Turbo. He has no fear of cars, even though he was in a crash once, with his dad. Fifteen stitches in his head. It was somebody else's fault: they jumped the lights. He's not going steady with a girl but he has a few girlfriends he sees all the time. He says that girls admire him for the muscles on his stomach although he doesn't even work out. Outside the strip-lighted classroom other people are coming into the building for classes and meetings and coffee and tea. You can hear music starting up for a dance class downstairs. All over the place the sense rises up of an effort being made; a sense of things being overcome and time being invested. The sound of laughter travels up the stairs and along the corridor. For money Darryl relies on his mum. She gives him a few quid here and there. So does his dad. But one of these days he's going to get a part-time job at Booker in Beckton; he would like it if he could have more money for drums or clothes or that Porsche Boxster Turbo. He is wearing a light green Ben Sherman shirt. He is very pleased with his hooded top from Paul Smith. His trousers cost 60 quid. His favourite shoes are Kickers and the ones he is wearing are brown and comfy. He wears white socks and he thinks that socks are important. His brown hair is cut into a kind of wedge but he says it's not a wedge, it's called curtains. Darryl sticks his tongue out when he makes a joke. When you ask him what he thinks of the police he begins to look a bit shifty. \"They do their job don't they, but I hate the way they pull up my mates just 'cos they've got bald heads.\" He used to have a bald head himself, but then he got into the pop singer Peter Andre who has hair hanging over his face: curtains. \"I feel quite sorted out in my head,\" he says. \"If I wanted to be a gangster I'd know what to do. But I don't want that. Not now. I don't get off on knowing villains or anything.\" He slumps in the chair, smiles in a lop-sided way, and looks around the room where he says good things have happened for him. \"I'd like to have a family some day,\" he says. Darryl's eyes are hazel. He is five foot five. He is 16 years old and proud of it, thank you. His favourite colour is claret. He walks down the stairs of Community Links smiling at every one and making jokes. The last I see of him, he picks up his bike and wheels it towards the doors. It is dark outside. He smiles a big smile as he hops on his bike and heads into Barking Road. Like the rest of the world out there, he is at his best with somewhere to go. On the way out I look at a piece of paper. It carries the words of Betty Young, an 86-year-old woman who helped set up Community Links at an East Ham shop in 1978. \"The shop was damp and it smelt of coal tar from when the chemist used to be there,\" she said. \"There was always boys there, at first three and then more, boys who should have been at school. I know some of them were in trouble but they were always good to me. Gradually we got things going. I remember thinking, I've seen a lot of bad things but this is a good.\" The 86-year-old's words - on a cold night last October - seemed almost to propel the British Male at 16 on his way up Barking Road. \u0095This article was taken from What if . . ? 15 Visions of Change for Britain's Inner Cities, which is published by Short Books today, priced \u00a35.99.

      "body": "<p>The only niggling concern about England's sauntering victory over South Africa here yesterday was that, if they really are preparing for the 2003 World Cup, they may have peaked too early. </p> <p>They won their opening match in the triangular series, which also features Zimbabwe, with some brio and with 10.3 overs to spare. It was only England's fourth one-day win by nine wickets and Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight took them to within 20 runs of their first by 10 wickets. For the moment blue is most definitely the colour and that World Cup exit after defeat by India at Edgbaston last May is almost forgotten. </p> <p>Hussain had described the South Africa Test side as a military operation and it must be remembered that yesterday they were without three senior officers. The absence of Allan Donald, Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes meant they were travelling incognito at times. </p> <p>Instead it was England who marched out with the parade soldier's measured step.

      "bodyText": "The only niggling concern about England's sauntering victory over South Africa here yesterday was that, if they really are preparing for the 2003 World Cup, they may have peaked too early. They won their opening match in the triangular series, which also features Zimbabwe, with some brio and with 10.3 overs to spare. It was only England's fourth one-day win by nine wickets and Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight took them to within 20 runs of their first by 10 wickets. For the moment blue is most definitely the colour and that World Cup exit after defeat by India at Edgbaston last May is almost forgotten. Hussain had described the South Africa Test side as a military operation and it must be remembered that yesterday they were without three senior officers. The absence of Allan Donald, Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes meant they were travelling incognito at times. Instead it was England who marched out with the parade soldier's measured step. In all departments it was a performance of high professionalism and self-discipline, and the fact that they were ultimately carried to victory by Hussain and Knight was of immense satisfaction to both batsmen.

      "body": "<b>dfic1999</b> <br> With reference to the defeat of the 'Mode of Trial' bill, Jack Straw's criticism of the undemocratic nature of the Lords looks ridiculous. The proposed reforms enshrine precisely that lack of accountability. An elected Lords could still be overruled, so why have the Wakeham/Blair stitch-up? <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> First, our report is certainly not a stitch-up between me and the prime minister. I chaired an independent commission with representatives from each of the main parties and other independent people with relevant experience. We sought to answer three questions. First, what is the second chamber for? What roles and functions should it carry out? Second, what sort of people do you need in order to enable the second chamber to carry out those tasks effectively? And third, how do you go about getting such people? </p> <p>You need to think about the consequences of having a chamber which was accountable to the electorate in the same way as the House of Commons is. Elections can in practice only be won by people with the backing of party machines; an elected second chamber's members will turn out to be the same kind of professional politicians that you see in the Commons. That wouldn't add value to the parliamentary process. </p> <p>That's why we recommend a house with a range of different sources of authority. Its authority will come from the quality of its arguments, the distinction of its members, the breadth of experience and expertise they can bring to bear and the fact that - unlike the Commons - the house will be broadly representative of the whole of British society.</p> <p>As to the suggestion that an elected Lords could still be overruled by the Parliament Act, the reality is that it would be very difficult to justify a situation in which one elected House of Parliament had to give way to another elected house. An elected House of Lords would have the same source of democratic authority as the Commons and that would be a recipe for damaging constitutional conflict.</p> <p>If the electorate votes in a general election to choose a government, that government has a mandate to carry out its policies. Sure, the second chamber should be able to force the government and the Commons to think again and to present a reasoned case for altering legislative proposals if they haven't been thought through properly. But the House of Commons should be the country's decisive political forum.</p> <p><b>Mossop</b><br> So instead of having representation by \"... just another bunch of professional politicians\" it's much better to have representation by a bunch of politicians' unelectable mates. This is authoritarian nonsense and a disgraceful display of contempt towards the electorate. </p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> This comment seems to me to miss the point that under our proposals the new members of the second chamber would be appointed by a totally independent Appointments Commission. Our report envisages an end to prime ministerial control of the size, party balance and individual membership of the second chamber and an end to political patronage. The independence of the Appointments Commission would be guaranteed by statute and its members would be appointed on a basis which had all-party support and couldn't be controlled by the government.</p> <p><b>simon44</b><br> What if you were to extend your proposal of upper house MPs being elected every 15 years for a single term to the entire upper house? That would reduce the hold of party whips. Furthermore, if it was done on a PR voting system (as I believe you propose) the chances of one party having a majority would be remote.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> The report makes clear that a majority of the members of the commission had a preference for using 'partially open' list PR to elect regional members of the second chamber. This would give electors the opportunity to vote for individual candidates or for party lists. But if the elections are to be held on the same day as elections to the European parliament, it seemed sensible to suggest that the same system should be used for both elections in order to avoid confusing the electors.</p> <p>I very much take the point about the need to ensure the independence of members of the reformed House of Lords. If individuals have to compete directly in elections, there is an even greater chance that they will be people who are committed to the parties concerned, bound by party manifesto commitments and dependent on their party for re-nomination, re-election or preferment. The use of a list system of PR would reduce the need for personal electioneering.</p> <p>But our proposals go further in ensuring the independence of members of the second chamber by giving them long terms of office and providing that regional members can only have one term. If they are doing a good job and want to carry on the Appointments Commission could reappoint them to the second chamber once their initial term of office had ended.</p> <p><b>wh52</b><br> There are very many people who have much to contribute to the way society is run, or have great experience in the workings of organisations that governments seek to control, eg experienced teachers, doctors, probation officers. There are also forms of local leadership outside mainstream politics such as tenants' groups, Citizen Advice Bureau organisers, Samaritans' volunteers who can input on the real impact of government decisions. These skills do not co-exist well with the rather self-centred political skills of running for office. Did you consider how to bring these skills into government, without requiring ministerial patronage?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> This is very much in line with what we have recommended in the report. We accept that the kind of skills and experience which people in a range of vocational or voluntary organisations may have are very different from the self-centred political skills of running for office. An independent Appointments Commission's remit would be to bring in people representative of a whole variety of different sectors of society - vocational, professional, cultural, sporting and so on. That will give a second chamber with a range of experience and expertise which is greater than that of the House of Commons so that it is able to bring different perspectives to bear. </p> <p><b>patrickford</b><br> The proposals are very disappointing and undemocratic; I voted Labour for a radical change. The number of proposed members is too high; there should be a maximum of 400 of whom 300 should be directly elected with the power to co-opt up to 100 other members for a fixed term subject to an independent appointments commission. Membership should be subject to similar conditions to those for the US Senate: not less than 30 years of age; British citizen for at least 9 years; resident in the area for which chosen. I suggest that the new assembly could be called the Moot or the Witanmoot reflecting the historical roots of our democracy.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> We want quite a lot of the members to be part-time members so they would have the chance to carry on with their business or professional lives or whatever, and come along to the Lords when there was a subject about which they felt deeply, or where they had a special contribution to make. I would rather have two or three active vice-chancellors in the Lords who could bring some real current knowledge to bear on debates than have one who would have to stop being a vice-chancellor in order to spend the time there.</p> <p><b>CAnselin</b><br> How much power do you feel, personally, upper chambers should possess? Are you saying that genuine bicameral democracies, such as the US and Australia, are inferior to the British system of an \"elective dictatorship\", where the government dominates the Commons AND the Lords?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> The House of Lords' problem has not been its lack of powers but its lack of confidence and authority to use its powers. I think this country needs a moderately powerful second chamber with the confidence and authority to force the government or the Commons to think again and either justify or amend its proposals.</p> <p>We believe parliament should continue to be bicameral and that it should become impossible for the government to dominate the Lords as well as the Commons. Equally, no opposition party should dominate the House of Lords. Our proposals would ensure that the Lords is not a compliant rubber stamp or a source of constitutional gridlock.</p> <p><b>PC49</b><br> I understand that the Commission want the new chamber to be \"broadly representative of the whole of British society\". In opinion polls over recent years a significant minority of the British public have supported the abolition of the monarchy and around one third have stated that they have no belief in any god. Is it your view, therefore, that the new chamber should include appointees who are professed republicans or atheists?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> I would be happy to see the whole spectrum of views held by members of British society reflected in the membership of the second chamber. </p> <p><b>njrq</b><br> As one who gave evidence to the commission in Edinburgh advocating a fully elected upper house, I am naturally disappointed that the commission has not followed this route. But I am also perplexed: what is the point of electing a small proportion of the house? This seems to me to have about as much logic as resolving a custody dispute by cutting the child down the middle (or in the case of your proposed proportions, splitting off 11%, 16% or 35% of said child).</p> <p>I would have thought that most democrats would share the view that a mostly unelected house is undemocratic, and be little happier with this than with a fully non-elected house.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> Our basic overall conclusion is that the chamber should be primarily appointed but that a significant minority of members should be 'regional members' who would be a voice for the nations and regions of the UK. The precise proportion is not crucial and indeed we put forward a range of models for consideration.</p> <p>The point is that a central Appointments Commission would not be very good at identifying the right people to speak for each of the nations and regions of the United Kingdom, alongside all the other people who will be there speaking for other sectors of society; someone selected for the North East by a London-based Appointments Commission would be no substitute for someone selected locally.</p> <p><b>jeffery99</b><br> The profound shifts in economic and political power that have taken place over the last decade - from national governments to unelected and unaccountable institutions, such as the WTO, or powerful transitional companies - means that there is very little public scrutiny over many of the forces that directly shape peoples lives. The Commons is clearly too obsessed with domestic issues and short term political advantage to play this role. Therefore, you and your colleagues should have taken this opportunity to present radical proposals to ensure that the second chamber was given the role of seeking to scrutinise and hold greater accountability over the supranational institutions and companies that preside over the process of globalisation as well as to improve the understanding of the connections between important global issues, such as poverty or the global environment, and the implications for the UK electorate. The failure to address this governance gap holds potentially profound implications for democracy.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> You make an interesting point but it goes beyond the terms of reference of the royal commission. Even parliament as a whole can only really be accountable for matters within its jurisdiction.</p> <p><b>nealbrown</b><br> Has your commission considered the model of the jury in your proposals? Some proportion of a second chamber could selected from the public on a similar basis as jurors are for trial by jury. Public representation would by definition be increased, using a system generally very well respected and considered fair. The apparent arbitrariness of such selection would in fact be a virtue, implying the possibility of a more disinterested participation.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> This was amongst the proposals which were put to us. It has the same kind of disadvantages as for random selection generally. You might get a cross-section of society but you wouldn't necessarily get people with the relevant skills and experience who would, collectively, have sufficient authority to act as a restraining influence on the government.</p> <p><b>rosslare</b><br> Given the appallingly low turnout in recent elections, why have you thought it appropriate to introduce a second chamber that is not directly accountable - surely this will further disillusion the electorate.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> I would put the point the other way round. Given that voters are expected to vote in local government elections, general elections, European elections and, in some areas, in elections for regional parliaments, and in referendums, the introduction of yet another round of elections could well have turned the electorate off even more successfully.</p> <p><b>simon44</b><br> If a third of the house were elected every five years, then the Commons would always have a more recent mandate than at least two thirds of the upper house, which would stop the upper house having a greater authority.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> Long terms would certainly reduce the hold of the party whips, especially if, as we propose, members couldn't be re-elected; but the problem is that you wouldn't get a house which was broadly representative of British society and you would be unlikely to get people with the kind of knowledge, skills and range of expertise which we think the second chamber should have if it is carry out its tasks effectively.</p> <p><b>ajkent</b><br> If an elected second chamber is unacceptable to the government, it would be better if they abolished it altogether. Cheaper, too. There should be a second chamber, with the current or very slightly increased powers, elected by PR. It would be more representative than the Commons and better able to limit excesses than currently when its credibility is impaired by the appointment process. The Commons should remain first-past-the-post, an electoral system better capable of producing strong governments.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> The point of having a second chamber made up in the way we propose is that it will be able to bring a far wider range of experience and expertise to bear on the consideration of proposed legislation and in scrutinising the government, and it will provide a voice in parliament for all sorts of different sectors of society - the nations and regions, minority ethnic groups, vocational, cultural, sporting and other walks of life. Such a chamber would have the authority which comes from being broadly representative of the society it seeks to serve but not the full democratic authority which is properly the preserve of the House of Commons.</p> <p><b>mthacker2</b><br> The majority of the population will have access to the internet in the lifetime of the next parliament. We simply no longer need representation at all. I can represent myself using modern technology to vote. I can ask parliamentary questions via e-mail. I can publish agendas, white papers, Hansard and I can table amendments via bulletin boards. I can debate issues using chat rooms. And I can vote on any topic at any time using simple replies to preformatted e-mails. This process supersedes party politics entirely and there is no further need for proportional representation, or first past the post, or an elected, or an unelected House of Lords. Even with the current levels of internet access it is significantly more democratic to allow these people to vote rather than the House of Lords. I am interested in why the royal commission dismissed this option? </p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> I think I would like to distinguish between the medium and the message. The distinctive feature of being a practising politician is having the skill to articulate people's views and work out practical solutions to the various problems which society faces. Even if everyone was connected to the internet the result would only be to accumulate people's differing views. It wouldn't help identify solutions.</p> <p><b>loesch</b><br> I would be particularly interested to know whether the commission has given consideration to ensuring that the interests of children, and of future generations, are represented in the second house, and that human rights are not just considered in relation to the European legislation?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> Our report specifically makes the point that the second chamber should have a long-term perspective and thus be more likely to take into account the interest of future generations. One way in which we achieve this is by recommending that all members serve for relatively long terms.</p> <p>We recommend the establishment of a committee in the second chamber with a wide-ranging remit to consider the human rights aspects of all proposed legislation.</p> <p><b>brucehuk</b><br> Why have you not taken the opportunity to recommend reform of the law lords to create something more akin to a supreme court, with greater transparency, a proper separation of the judiciary and the legislature, and a more open and representative form of appointment?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> We had to consider whether it was out of the question for the reformed Lords to continue to be the highest court of appeal in the country. On balance, we took the view that the present arrangements can continue pending a further dedicated inquiry. There are advantages in having the senior judiciary in the Lords where they are directly exposed to the thinking behind the formulation of legislation.</p> <p><b>garnerad</b><br> What sort of people would you like to see selected by the independent commission for the new upper house? Would you like to see as many ex-MPs as there are now?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> As a group they should be authoritative, confident, broadly representative with a breadth of experience outside the world of politics and a broad range of expertise. They should have particular skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment of constitutional matters and human rights and the ability to bring a philosophical, moral or spiritual perspective to bear. They should be free of domination by political parties.</p> <p><b>gbest</b><br> Why do you think an independent commission would be better at selecting specialists or people from a cross section of British society than the electorate at large?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> The hard fact is that elections do not tend to produce either relevant specialists or people who are a representative cross section of British society. Increasingly, members of the Commons are drawn from a relatively narrow group of people with a long-standing commitment to political activity. The House of Lords should enable a different range of experience to be brought to bear.</p> <p><b>rohanis</b><br> Might a partly elected, partly appointed house become a two-tier one where elected members are considered to have more \"legitimacy\" than appointees? Also, do you consider it probable that a degree of apathy may attend elections to the second house?</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> We were very concerned to limit the risk of a two-tier membership. Under our recommendations all members would be formally appointed by the Appointments Commission, even those chosen by the regional electorates. They would serve for terms of about the same length and they would all have the same terms and conditions.</p> <p>Both regional members and directly appointed members will be distributed between the parties on a proportional basis. The problem with the Lords until now is that hereditaries tended to be drawn predominantly from one party. Such a situation would not arise under our recommendations.</p> <p><b>Mossop</b><br> The appointees are very likely to come from the ranks of failed politicians, those who the electorate have rejected but that the parties wish to keep. As you admit the commission will be controlled by political parties. So all we as a people end up with is the career politicians we couldn't be persuaded to vote for in the first place. I find it humiliating that this is what we're being offered.</p> <p><b>Lord Wakeham</b><br> I certainly do not accept that the Appointments Commission will be controlled by the political parties. It will be totally independent.</p> <p>This has been an interesting experience. I am glad to have had the opportunity to participate. I welcome the interest which you have all showed in the important issues covered by our report. I hope I have been able to explain a little more of the thinking behind our recommendations.</p>",

This would give electors the opportunity to vote for individual candidates or for party lists. But if the elections are to be held on the same day as elections to the European parliament, it seemed sensible to suggest that the same system should be used for both elections in order to avoid confusing the electors. I very much take the point about the need to ensure the independence of members of the reformed House of Lords. If individuals have to compete directly in elections, there is an even greater chance that they will be people who are committed to the parties concerned, bound by party manifesto commitments and dependent on their party for re-nomination, re-election or preferment. The use of a list system of PR would reduce the need for personal electioneering. But our proposals go further in ensuring the independence of members of the second chamber by giving them long terms of office and providing that regional members can only have one term. If they are doing a good job and want to carry on the Appointments Commission could reappoint them to the second chamber once their initial term of office had ended. wh52 There are very many people who have much to contribute to the way society is run, or have great experience in the workings of organisations that governments seek to control, eg experienced teachers, doctors, probation officers. There are also forms of local leadership outside mainstream politics such as tenants' groups, Citizen Advice Bureau organisers, Samaritans' volunteers who can input on the real impact of government decisions. These skills do not co-exist well with the rather self-centred political skills of running for office. Did you consider how to bring these skills into government, without requiring ministerial patronage? Lord Wakeham This is very much in line with what we have recommended in the report. We accept that the kind of skills and experience which people in a range of vocational or voluntary organisations may have are very different from the self-centred political skills of running for office. An independent Appointments Commission's remit would be to bring in people representative of a whole variety of different sectors of society - vocational, professional, cultural, sporting and so on. That will give a second chamber with a range of experience and expertise which is greater than that of the House of Commons so that it is able to bring different perspectives to bear. patrickford The proposals are very disappointing and undemocratic; I voted Labour for a radical change. The number of proposed members is too high; there should be a maximum of 400 of whom 300 should be directly elected with the power to co-opt up to 100 other members for a fixed term subject to an independent appointments commission. Membership should be subject to similar conditions to those for the US Senate: not less than 30 years of age; British citizen for at least 9 years; resident in the area for which chosen. I suggest that the new assembly could be called the Moot or the Witanmoot reflecting the historical roots of our democracy. Lord Wakeham We want quite a lot of the members to be part-time members so they would have the chance to carry on with their business or professional lives or whatever, and come along to the Lords when there was a subject about which they felt deeply, or where they had a special contribution to make. I would rather have two or three active vice-chancellors in the Lords who could bring some real current knowledge to bear on debates than have one who would have to stop being a vice-chancellor in order to spend the time there. CAnselin How much power do you feel, personally, upper chambers should possess? Are you saying that genuine bicameral democracies, such as the US and Australia, are inferior to the British system of an \"elective dictatorship\", where the government dominates the Commons AND the Lords? Lord Wakeham The House of Lords' problem has not been its lack of powers but its lack of confidence and authority to use its powers. I think this country needs a moderately powerful second chamber with the confidence and authority to force the government or the Commons to think again and either justify or amend its proposals. We believe parliament should continue to be bicameral and that it should become impossible for the government to dominate the Lords as well as the Commons. Equally, no opposition party should dominate the House of Lords. Our proposals would ensure that the Lords is not a compliant rubber stamp or a source of constitutional gridlock. PC49 I understand that the Commission want the new chamber to be \"broadly representative of the whole of British society\". In opinion polls over recent years a significant minority of the British public have supported the abolition of the monarchy and around one third have stated that they have no belief in any god. Is it your view, therefore, that the new chamber should include appointees who are professed republicans or atheists? Lord Wakeham I would be happy to see the whole spectrum of views held by members of British society reflected in the membership of the second chamber. njrq As one who gave evidence to the commission in Edinburgh advocating a fully elected upper house, I am naturally disappointed that the commission has not followed this route. But I am also perplexed: what is the point of electing a small proportion of the house? This seems to me to have about as much logic as resolving a custody dispute by cutting the child down the middle (or in the case of your proposed proportions, splitting off 11%, 16% or 35% of said child). I would have thought that most democrats would share the view that a mostly unelected house is undemocratic, and be little happier with this than with a fully non-elected house. Lord Wakeham Our basic overall conclusion is that the chamber should be primarily appointed but that a significant minority of members should be 'regional members' who would be a voice for the nations and regions of the UK. The precise proportion is not crucial and indeed we put forward a range of models for consideration. The point is that a central Appointments Commission would not be very good at identifying the right people to speak for each of the nations and regions of the United Kingdom, alongside all the other people who will be there speaking for other sectors of society; someone selected for the North East by a London-based Appointments Commission would be no substitute for someone selected locally. jeffery99 The profound shifts in economic and political power that have taken place over the last decade - from national governments to unelected and unaccountable institutions, such as the WTO, or powerful transitional companies - means that there is very little public scrutiny over many of the forces that directly shape peoples lives. The Commons is clearly too obsessed with domestic issues and short term political advantage to play this role. Therefore, you and your colleagues should have taken this opportunity to present radical proposals to ensure that the second chamber was given the role of seeking to scrutinise and hold greater accountability over the supranational institutions and companies that preside over the process of globalisation as well as to improve the understanding of the connections between important global issues, such as poverty or the global environment, and the implications for the UK electorate. The failure to address this governance gap holds potentially profound implications for democracy. Lord Wakeham You make an interesting point but it goes beyond the terms of reference of the royal commission. Even parliament as a whole can only really be accountable for matters within its jurisdiction. nealbrown Has your commission considered the model of the jury in your proposals? Some proportion of a second chamber could selected from the public on a similar basis as jurors are for trial by jury. Public representation would by definition be increased, using a system generally very well respected and considered fair. The apparent arbitrariness of such selection would in fact be a virtue, implying the possibility of a more disinterested participation. Lord Wakeham This was amongst the proposals which were put to us. It has the same kind of disadvantages as for random selection generally. You might get a cross-section of society but you wouldn't necessarily get people with the relevant skills and experience who would, collectively, have sufficient authority to act as a restraining influence on the government. rosslare Given the appallingly low turnout in recent elections, why have you thought it appropriate to introduce a second chamber that is not directly accountable - surely this will further disillusion the electorate. Lord Wakeham I would put the point the other way round. Given that voters are expected to vote in local government elections, general elections, European elections and, in some areas, in elections for regional parliaments, and in referendums, the introduction of yet another round of elections could well have turned the electorate off even more successfully. simon44 If a third of the house were elected every five years, then the Commons would always have a more recent mandate than at least two thirds of the upper house, which would stop the upper house having a greater authority. Lord Wakeham Long terms would certainly reduce the hold of the party whips, especially if, as we propose, members couldn't be re-elected; but the problem is that you wouldn't get a house which was broadly representative of British society and you would be unlikely to get people with the kind of knowledge, skills and range of expertise which we think the second chamber should have if it is carry out its tasks effectively. ajkent If an elected second chamber is unacceptable to the government, it would be better if they abolished it altogether. Cheaper, too. There should be a second chamber, with the current or very slightly increased powers, elected by PR. It would be more representative than the Commons and better able to limit excesses than currently when its credibility is impaired by the appointment process. The Commons should remain first-past-the-post, an electoral system better capable of producing strong governments. Lord Wakeham The point of having a second chamber made up in the way we propose is that it will be able to bring a far wider range of experience and expertise to bear on the consideration of proposed legislation and in scrutinising the government, and it will provide a voice in parliament for all sorts of different sectors of society - the nations and regions, minority ethnic groups, vocational, cultural, sporting and other walks of life. Such a chamber would have the authority which comes from being broadly representative of the society it seeks to serve but not the full democratic authority which is properly the preserve of the House of Commons. mthacker2 The majority of the population will have access to the internet in the lifetime of the next parliament. We simply no longer need representation at all. I can represent myself using modern technology to vote. I can ask parliamentary questions via e-mail. I can publish agendas, white papers, Hansard and I can table amendments via bulletin boards. I can debate issues using chat rooms. And I can vote on any topic at any time using simple replies to preformatted e-mails. This process supersedes party politics entirely and there is no further need for proportional representation, or first past the post, or an elected, or an unelected House of Lords. Even with the current levels of internet access it is significantly more democratic to allow these people to vote rather than the House of Lords. I am interested in why the royal commission dismissed this option? Lord Wakeham I think I would like to distinguish between the medium and the message. The distinctive feature of being a practising politician is having the skill to articulate people's views and work out practical solutions to the various problems which society faces. Even if everyone was connected to the internet the result would only be to accumulate people's differing views. It wouldn't help identify solutions. loesch I would be particularly interested to know whether the commission has given consideration to ensuring that the interests of children, and of future generations, are represented in the second house, and that human rights are not just considered in relation to the European legislation? Lord Wakeham Our report specifically makes the point that the second chamber should have a long-term perspective and thus be more likely to take into account the interest of future generations. One way in which we achieve this is by recommending that all members serve for relatively long terms. We recommend the establishment of a committee in the second chamber with a wide-ranging remit to consider the human rights aspects of all proposed legislation. brucehuk Why have you not taken the opportunity to recommend reform of the law lords to create something more akin to a supreme court, with greater transparency, a proper separation of the judiciary and the legislature, and a more open and representative form of appointment? Lord Wakeham We had to consider whether it was out of the question for the reformed Lords to continue to be the highest court of appeal in the country. On balance, we took the view that the present arrangements can continue pending a further dedicated inquiry. There are advantages in having the senior judiciary in the Lords where they are directly exposed to the thinking behind the formulation of legislation. garnerad What sort of people would you like to see selected by the independent commission for the new upper house? Would you like to see as many ex-MPs as there are now? Lord Wakeham As a group they should be authoritative, confident, broadly representative with a breadth of experience outside the world of politics and a broad range of expertise. They should have particular skills and knowledge relevant to the careful assessment of constitutional matters and human rights and the ability to bring a philosophical, moral or spiritual perspective to bear. They should be free of domination by political parties. gbest Why do you think an independent commission would be better at selecting specialists or people from a cross section of British society than the electorate at large? Lord Wakeham The hard fact is that elections do not tend to produce either relevant specialists or people who are a representative cross section of British society. Increasingly, members of the Commons are drawn from a relatively narrow group of people with a long-standing commitment to political activity. The House of Lords should enable a different range of experience to be brought to bear. rohanis Might a partly elected, partly appointed house become a two-tier one where elected members are considered to have more \"legitimacy\" than appointees? Also, do you consider it probable that a degree of apathy may attend elections to the second house? Lord Wakeham We were very concerned to limit the risk of a two-tier membership. Under our recommendations all members would be formally appointed by the Appointments Commission, even those chosen by the regional electorates. They would serve for terms of about the same length and they would all have the same terms and conditions. Both regional members and directly appointed members will be distributed between the parties on a proportional basis. The problem with the Lords until now is that hereditaries tended to be drawn predominantly from one party. Such a situation would not arise under our recommendations. Mossop The appointees are very likely to come from the ranks of failed politicians, those who the electorate have rejected but that the parties wish to keep. As you admit the commission will be controlled by political parties. So all we as a people end up with is the career politicians we couldn't be persuaded to vote for in the first place. I find it humiliating that this is what we're being offered. Lord Wakeham I certainly do not accept that the Appointments Commission will be controlled by the political parties. It will be totally independent. This has been an interesting experience. I am glad to have had the opportunity to participate. I welcome the interest which you have all showed in the important issues covered by our report. I hope I have been able to explain a little more of the thinking behind our recommendations.",

Their away form has been patchy this season - four wins and four defeats with the defence at times showing uncharacteristic generosity. Wenger may even have offered Gilles Grimandi a silent vote of thanks for missing a penalty in last Wednesday's shoot-out at Filbert Street to send Leicester City through to the last 16 of the FA Cup while at the same time easing Arsenal's fixture list but the team's tepid performance contrasted sharply with their ebullient form in the 4-1 victory over Sunderland at Highbury four days earlier. Tonight's outcome will depend to a large degree on who takes control of the midfield - Roy Keane for United or Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit for Arsenal. Still without Paul Scholes, United will be looking to Ryan Giggs to torment an Arsenal defence now relying more than ever on Martin Keown. Dwight Yorke's form did not improve in Rio but at least Ferguson is not suffering from Wenger's chronic shortage of strikers. With Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars unfit and Nwankwo Kanu away on African Nations Cup duty for Nigeria this is a bad moment for Davor Suker to be serving a one-match suspension. Thierry Henry, whose successful conversion from winger to central striker has done much to offset the loss of Nicolas Anelka's pace through the middle, will lead the Arsenal attack tonight but the Frenchman will find Jaap Stam a rather different proposition from Steve Bould, the old Gunner he consistently beat for speed in the Sunderland match. Wenger's assertion that Mark Bosnich, the Manchester United goalkeeper, is no Peter Schmeichel sounded like a rather desperate mind game. David Seaman is more likely to be given a searching examination this time.

      "bodyText": "The only black member of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, which found that the metropolitan police was institutionally racist, yesterday said he felt demeaned after an officer stopped and searched his car. John Sentamu, the Anglican Bishop of Stepney, was made to get out of his vehicle in the rain after being stopped near St Paul's cathedral. He said it was the eighth time in eight years that he had been questioned by police exercising their stop and search powers, which research has shown is directed disproportionately at black people. The incident is another setback for the police, who are trying to prove they have learned the lessons of the Lawrence inquiry. The bishop, 50, said that when he asked why he had been stopped the officer ordered him to open the boot so it could be searched. The bishop, an internationally respected figure who was jailed by the Ugandan despot, Idi Amin, was driving back to his east London home just after midnight on Tuesday. He said that a taxi and two cars had passed the officer before he was stopped. His clerical collar was hidden by a scarf and an anorak as the City of London officer asked where he was going. The bishop asked him why he had been stopped. \"He said 'just open the boot'. His voice was getting agitated. \"He asked me what I did, and I said 'I'm the Bishop of Stepney'. He said 'whoops'. I revealed my dog collar and he looked as if he'd just seen a ghost.\" Despite repeated requests, the officer would not justify his search to the bishop and had kept saying \"off you go\". The bishop said he did not know why he had been stopped, but added that he did not know of any white bishop who had been treated in such a way by the police. He added: \"When you ask and somebody doesn't give a reason and they seem to be hiding behind a uniform, in terms of human relationships you're not entering into a human dialogue. \"That creates a feeling that they are more powerful than you and can act in any way they want over you. I just felt as if I was being treated like a little boy. \"It shouldn't happen. This is not a police state. They operate with the consent of the public.\" Under the police and criminal evidence act an officer must have reasonable grounds to stop a person and must tell them a reason. Earlier this month Neville Lawrence, whose teenage son Stephen was murdered in a racist attack, was stopped by officers from the Metropolitan police. The bishop said he would not make an official complaint. In a statement the City of London police refused to answer any questions and would only say: \"The information you require is subject to legal privilege and we are therefore unable to discuss the matter any further.\" The bishop was one of three advisers to Sir William Macpherson's public inquiry into the metropolitan police's bungling of the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation. Sir William concluded that stop and search was a valuable tool against crime, but that the police used it in a discriminatory way against ethnic minorities. Last week the prime minister, Tony Blair, called for the power to be used more sensitively. Some officers have claimed that the post-Macpherson climate has left them scared of using the power for fear of being branded racist, and that that has led to a rise in crime.",

      "body": "<p><strong>STAN AND DELIVER</strong></p> <p>Like all great protests, Stanley Collymore's bedroom lock-in has become something of a cause cel\u00e8bre. It seems no dinner party is complete without the chattering classes pledging to free Stanley from his 'pit' (the prime concern being the ever-expanding piles of dirty underwear, which could soon block out all sunlight). But what is really being done to help the Aston One? Here is the situation as it currently stands.</p> <p>Joining the Stanley Liberation Front today are Premiership shortcomers Bradford City. Their membership was approved this morning, only hours after Leicester dropped out of the race (or rather the unsteady stagger) for Stanley's signature. In a cheeky overstatement, Martin O'Neill told the press, \"Right now we are a million miles away from doing anything.\" So the Bantams are now at the front of the Stanley queue. They may be the only ones in the queue, but it's a start.</p> <p>Impediments have arisen already, however. It seems that Bradford aren't too keen on spending a lot of money on someone who's only going to be miserable, although they will take Stanley on a free transfer. Villa meanwhile want some money back on their \u00a37m 'investment'. \"We have been given permission to talk to the player by Aston Villa,\" said Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond. \"However, we are not in agreement with them with regard to the terms on which he could join.\"</p> <p>So, as the crisis moves into its seventh month, the impasse remains as intractable as ever. And until both parties realise that the only terms Stanley will agree to are his own, the outlook is bleak. This is the Fiver, reporting for the Fiver, outside Stanley's bedroom.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>MAKE YOUR OWEN MIND UP</strong></p> <p>Michael Owen is not seriously injured. How many times do we have to say it? Just because England's wonder kid limps off 10 minutes into almost every match he plays, it does not mean his career is almost over. He's just saving himself, or simply learning how to limp (no mean feat, as the Fiver can attest after trying to get a reduced one-legged rate at Alton Towers last week). So stop worrying.</p> <p>After all, Gerard Houllier isn't worried. He spoke to the press about the injury Owen sustained against Middlesbrough on Saturday and said: \"Obviously we are a bit worried.\" Er. \"It's not the same muscle, but it's a problem with the group of muscles. I was told one of the main causes could be to do with the back or the pelvis.\" That sounds terrible. Could you hang on a second? Feeling a little dizzy.</p> <p>Better now. As we were saying, there is absolutely nothing to worry about at all whatsoever. Just listen to Liverpool spokesman Ian Cotton: \"Michael received treatment this morning on his hamstring problem.\" But there is no problem! \"We hope he will be back for the game against Leeds on February 5th.\" At last. See, we told you there's no long-term injury problem. And as for Robbie Fowler...</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We have to go out there thinking we are playing someone like Bradford.\" - Ray Parlour indulges in subtle mind manipulation techniques ahead of tonight's battle with Manchester United.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WHIPPING THE GAME INTO SHAPE</strong></p> <p>We don't imagine the entire staff of the Scottish Football Association have visited an S&amp;M convention lately, but you'd be excused for thinking they had on the evidence of this morning. Because they've gone discipline crazy!</p> <p>Celtic's head of golf, Kenny Dalglish, was the first to be flogged to within an inch of his life with a stick which has a rule-book attached to it by a piece of string. The young rascal rushed into referee John Rowbotham's room yesterday following his team's 2-1 win at Dundee and had a quick pop over the dismissal of Vidar Riseth. He won't be doing that again - he's been warned about his future conduct.</p> <p>Next up for a thrashing was Rangers boss Dick Advocaat. After the Old Firm match in November, this tearaway had the temerity to burst into Mr Rowbotham's room and complain that Paul Lambert hadn't been sent off after an incident with Jorg Albertz (instead he'd been stretchered off minus some teeth). Dick's been severely censured today - let that be a lesson to him.</p> <p>Having dealt with these rapscallions in no uncertain terms, the SFA could be forgiven for licking its lips at the prospect of a little session with Ian Wright. The cheeky chat-show chappie may yet avoid chastisement, the SFA promising to \"wait until we receive the referee's report\". But seeing that Wrighty squared up to Kilmarnock defender Jim Lauchlan and got himself \"involved in an incident\" with the fourth official after Celtic's game at Rugby Park, we think the SFA may not be able to resist, the state they're in at present.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Liverpool will attempt to sign Pierre van Hooijdonk on loan from Vitesse Arnhem until the end of the season as cover for Michael Owen.</p> <p>Chelsea will bid \u00a312m for Sunderland striker Kevin Phillips, according to Teamtalk.</p> <p>Juventus are prepared to pay \u00a35m for West Brom teenager Enzo Maresca.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>This year's FA Cup semi-finals may be played a week apart.

      "bodyText": "STAN AND DELIVER Like all great protests, Stanley Collymore's bedroom lock-in has become something of a cause cel\u00e8bre. It seems no dinner party is complete without the chattering classes pledging to free Stanley from his 'pit' (the prime concern being the ever-expanding piles of dirty underwear, which could soon block out all sunlight). But what is really being done to help the Aston One? Here is the situation as it currently stands. Joining the Stanley Liberation Front today are Premiership shortcomers Bradford City. Their membership was approved this morning, only hours after Leicester dropped out of the race (or rather the unsteady stagger) for Stanley's signature. In a cheeky overstatement, Martin O'Neill told the press, \"Right now we are a million miles away from doing anything.\" So the Bantams are now at the front of the Stanley queue. They may be the only ones in the queue, but it's a start. Impediments have arisen already, however. It seems that Bradford aren't too keen on spending a lot of money on someone who's only going to be miserable, although they will take Stanley on a free transfer. Villa meanwhile want some money back on their \u00a37m 'investment'. \"We have been given permission to talk to the player by Aston Villa,\" said Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond. \"However, we are not in agreement with them with regard to the terms on which he could join.\" So, as the crisis moves into its seventh month, the impasse remains as intractable as ever. And until both parties realise that the only terms Stanley will agree to are his own, the outlook is bleak. This is the Fiver, reporting for the Fiver, outside Stanley's bedroom. * * * * * * * * * * * * * MAKE YOUR OWEN MIND UP Michael Owen is not seriously injured. How many times do we have to say it? Just because England's wonder kid limps off 10 minutes into almost every match he plays, it does not mean his career is almost over. He's just saving himself, or simply learning how to limp (no mean feat, as the Fiver can attest after trying to get a reduced one-legged rate at Alton Towers last week). So stop worrying. After all, Gerard Houllier isn't worried. He spoke to the press about the injury Owen sustained against Middlesbrough on Saturday and said: \"Obviously we are a bit worried.\" Er. \"It's not the same muscle, but it's a problem with the group of muscles. I was told one of the main causes could be to do with the back or the pelvis.\" That sounds terrible. Could you hang on a second? Feeling a little dizzy. Better now. As we were saying, there is absolutely nothing to worry about at all whatsoever. Just listen to Liverpool spokesman Ian Cotton: \"Michael received treatment this morning on his hamstring problem.\" But there is no problem! \"We hope he will be back for the game against Leeds on February 5th.\" At last. See, we told you there's no long-term injury problem. And as for Robbie Fowler... * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We have to go out there thinking we are playing someone like Bradford.\" - Ray Parlour indulges in subtle mind manipulation techniques ahead of tonight's battle with Manchester United. * * * * * * * * * * * * * WHIPPING THE GAME INTO SHAPE We don't imagine the entire staff of the Scottish Football Association have visited an S&amp;M convention lately, but you'd be excused for thinking they had on the evidence of this morning. Because they've gone discipline crazy! Celtic's head of golf, Kenny Dalglish, was the first to be flogged to within an inch of his life with a stick which has a rule-book attached to it by a piece of string. The young rascal rushed into referee John Rowbotham's room yesterday following his team's 2-1 win at Dundee and had a quick pop over the dismissal of Vidar Riseth. He won't be doing that again - he's been warned about his future conduct. Next up for a thrashing was Rangers boss Dick Advocaat. After the Old Firm match in November, this tearaway had the temerity to burst into Mr Rowbotham's room and complain that Paul Lambert hadn't been sent off after an incident with Jorg Albertz (instead he'd been stretchered off minus some teeth). Dick's been severely censured today - let that be a lesson to him. Having dealt with these rapscallions in no uncertain terms, the SFA could be forgiven for licking its lips at the prospect of a little session with Ian Wright. The cheeky chat-show chappie may yet avoid chastisement, the SFA promising to \"wait until we receive the referee's report\". But seeing that Wrighty squared up to Kilmarnock defender Jim Lauchlan and got himself \"involved in an incident\" with the fourth official after Celtic's game at Rugby Park, we think the SFA may not be able to resist, the state they're in at present. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Liverpool will attempt to sign Pierre van Hooijdonk on loan from Vitesse Arnhem until the end of the season as cover for Michael Owen. Chelsea will bid \u00a312m for Sunderland striker Kevin Phillips, according to Teamtalk. Juventus are prepared to pay \u00a35m for West Brom teenager Enzo Maresca. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF This year's FA Cup semi-finals may be played a week apart. The move is being considered by Adam Crozier, the FA's new chief executive, to resolve the problem caused by the FA's decision to play both semi-finals at Wembley. A Sunday double header has been ruled out by police, while a televised Saturday game would clash with the league programme and the Grand National. Spurs have signed Swedish U-17 captain Jon Jonssen. Former Leicester and Coventry manager Gordon Milne is set to become Director of Football at Newcastle, according to the Newcastle Evening Chronicle. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (12.35am) You want goals?

      "body": "<p>Through all the speculation as to who would land the plum role of ITN political editor upon the retirement of Michael Brunson, no one tipped John Sergeant. Least of all the man himself, who was at the time engaged in discussions with the Antiques Roadshow and very much set to be the new Hugh Scully. </p> <p>Having reached his mid-50s with 30 years of BBC reporting behind him and, in his words, \"with BBC printed through and through like a stick of rock\", Sergeant did not imagine he was in the running. There was also - though he is too delicate to frame it in such a way - the concern that he might be a bit past it. John Simpson, he notes, is the only one left of his contemporaries who you could have heard on a bulletin in 1970. </p> <p>So as names such as Adam Boulton, James Mates - even BBC colleagues Jeremy Vine and John Kampfner - were mentioned by such distinguished commentators as Charlie Whelan, Sergeant was applying himself with careful consideration to the question of what form his career should take in five years' time. </p> <p>\"I honestly wasn't bothered. I didn't see how they'd want someone so identified with the BBC. I was in discussions about whether I might present the Antiques Roadshow. And in negotiations to do a funny anecdote book. </p> <p>\"That's the stage of my career. I knew I had to get an answer to, not so much what am I doing now, but what am I going to do at 60? For the last 18 months I've been very concerned with that. That's where the comedy programmes come in.\" </p> <p>A sparkling appearance on Have I Got News For You, which only arose because Jon Snow had to go to Belfast, propelled this most unlikely of the new breed of celebrity into the showbiz limelight. Room 101 followed, along with Call My Bluff and The News Quiz and Sergeant's stock was suddenly rising. As one BBC insider said last week, \"ITN was attracted by his 'showbiz appeal' - on ITV you need the solemnity, but you also need the personality.\" </p> <p>That ITN was motivated by its new signing's ability to make Paul Merton laugh, rather than his trenchant analysis born of decades of experience, seems unlikely. But Sergeant, while in no sense the victim of false modesty, is the first to be slightly bemused by their choice. </p> <p>\"No one's offered me a job ever. Ever. So I thought 'fantastic.' \" They made him an offer - \"jolly nice and generous\" - the terms of which he will not discuss but which is reported to be worth either \u00a3110,000 or \u00a3140,000 (\"it just might conceivably involve a salary increase\", he notes drily ) - and the deal was there would be no bidding war. </p> <p>It was out of the frame of his experience, he says. \"Make the pitch, go to the [appointments] board, get rejected. That's what I'm used to.\" </p> <p>He is referring, you suspect among other setbacks, to the appointment over his head of Robin Oakley as political editor of BBC News. \"Was I disappointed when he was brought in? Of course I was. He was an outsider, he was from print journalism - I've always thought that broadcast journalism was extremely difficult and extremely specialist.\" </p> <p>He compares his relationship with Oakley to that between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Take from that what you will. \"He's one of the genuine nice people in journalism. Not like me - I can be horrible. I can be trouble. Having me as a deputy is almost invariably difficult.\" </p> <p>Talk was that the two could barely be civil to each other, such was the resentment. \"The deal was we would not row with each other. It's too combustible and too tricky. I'm not saying it's always the case and we've always managed it, but he has been from that point of view impeccable and he's put up with me appearing on comedy programmes and so on.\" </p> <p>He is endeavouring to be discreet about leaving the BBC. Yet there are a couple of glimpses of the troublesome Sergeant beneath the urbane wit. He describes the negotiations surrounding his first appearance on Have I Got News For You, when like a good BBC employee he asked permission to appear and was emailed with a firm no. </p> <p>But \"like Lord Nelson,\" he laughs, he didn't receive the message. So when, on the eve of the recording, he was tackled about this, he said: \"Well now the decision is a different one, because we have told the programme that we intend to go ahead, and it now looks as if it's pull out time . . . And I can't guarantee that won't be 'BBC fails test'.\" </p> <p>He says this so innocently, that you almost miss the implied threat - you pull me out of this programme and I will ensure that the world knows about it. </p> <p>Was he, as the Times reported last week, being forced out by the BBC News management? Told to make way for the younger correspondents? Flat denial. There was no such meeting. (The BBC deny it too). </p> <p>He was, though, at the crossroads of broadcasting - whether to carry on in political journalism or to forge a new career in the panel game merry-go-round of light entertainment. He says it's no longer an issue. It will be considerably easier for him to write the book at ITN than at the BBC, and \"I've got The Job. I feel much more sated. </p> <p>\"But you mustn't write that I was reduced to a decision between Antiques Roadshow or politics. Antiques Roadshow is a fine job for a broadcaster. It gets 8.9m viewers . . .\" </p> <p>His colleagues and peers in the political lobby frequently use the word \"obsessive\" to describe him, though they mean it with respect. What about his interviewees? Does he have over-anxious subjects who interpret his reaction to their thoughts?

      "bodyText": "Through all the speculation as to who would land the plum role of ITN political editor upon the retirement of Michael Brunson, no one tipped John Sergeant. Least of all the man himself, who was at the time engaged in discussions with the Antiques Roadshow and very much set to be the new Hugh Scully. Having reached his mid-50s with 30 years of BBC reporting behind him and, in his words, \"with BBC printed through and through like a stick of rock\", Sergeant did not imagine he was in the running. There was also - though he is too delicate to frame it in such a way - the concern that he might be a bit past it. John Simpson, he notes, is the only one left of his contemporaries who you could have heard on a bulletin in 1970. So as names such as Adam Boulton, James Mates - even BBC colleagues Jeremy Vine and John Kampfner - were mentioned by such distinguished commentators as Charlie Whelan, Sergeant was applying himself with careful consideration to the question of what form his career should take in five years' time. \"I honestly wasn't bothered. I didn't see how they'd want someone so identified with the BBC. I was in discussions about whether I might present the Antiques Roadshow. And in negotiations to do a funny anecdote book. \"That's the stage of my career. I knew I had to get an answer to, not so much what am I doing now, but what am I going to do at 60? For the last 18 months I've been very concerned with that. That's where the comedy programmes come in.\" A sparkling appearance on Have I Got News For You, which only arose because Jon Snow had to go to Belfast, propelled this most unlikely of the new breed of celebrity into the showbiz limelight. Room 101 followed, along with Call My Bluff and The News Quiz and Sergeant's stock was suddenly rising. As one BBC insider said last week, \"ITN was attracted by his 'showbiz appeal' - on ITV you need the solemnity, but you also need the personality.\" That ITN was motivated by its new signing's ability to make Paul Merton laugh, rather than his trenchant analysis born of decades of experience, seems unlikely. But Sergeant, while in no sense the victim of false modesty, is the first to be slightly bemused by their choice. \"No one's offered me a job ever. Ever. So I thought 'fantastic.' \" They made him an offer - \"jolly nice and generous\" - the terms of which he will not discuss but which is reported to be worth either \u00a3110,000 or \u00a3140,000 (\"it just might conceivably involve a salary increase\", he notes drily ) - and the deal was there would be no bidding war. It was out of the frame of his experience, he says. \"Make the pitch, go to the [appointments] board, get rejected. That's what I'm used to.\" He is referring, you suspect among other setbacks, to the appointment over his head of Robin Oakley as political editor of BBC News. \"Was I disappointed when he was brought in? Of course I was. He was an outsider, he was from print journalism - I've always thought that broadcast journalism was extremely difficult and extremely specialist.\" He compares his relationship with Oakley to that between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Take from that what you will. \"He's one of the genuine nice people in journalism. Not like me - I can be horrible. I can be trouble. Having me as a deputy is almost invariably difficult.\" Talk was that the two could barely be civil to each other, such was the resentment. \"The deal was we would not row with each other. It's too combustible and too tricky. I'm not saying it's always the case and we've always managed it, but he has been from that point of view impeccable and he's put up with me appearing on comedy programmes and so on.\" He is endeavouring to be discreet about leaving the BBC. Yet there are a couple of glimpses of the troublesome Sergeant beneath the urbane wit. He describes the negotiations surrounding his first appearance on Have I Got News For You, when like a good BBC employee he asked permission to appear and was emailed with a firm no. But \"like Lord Nelson,\" he laughs, he didn't receive the message. So when, on the eve of the recording, he was tackled about this, he said: \"Well now the decision is a different one, because we have told the programme that we intend to go ahead, and it now looks as if it's pull out time . . . And I can't guarantee that won't be 'BBC fails test'.\" He says this so innocently, that you almost miss the implied threat - you pull me out of this programme and I will ensure that the world knows about it. Was he, as the Times reported last week, being forced out by the BBC News management? Told to make way for the younger correspondents? Flat denial. There was no such meeting. (The BBC deny it too). He was, though, at the crossroads of broadcasting - whether to carry on in political journalism or to forge a new career in the panel game merry-go-round of light entertainment. He says it's no longer an issue. It will be considerably easier for him to write the book at ITN than at the BBC, and \"I've got The Job. I feel much more sated. \"But you mustn't write that I was reduced to a decision between Antiques Roadshow or politics. Antiques Roadshow is a fine job for a broadcaster. It gets 8.9m viewers . . .\" His colleagues and peers in the political lobby frequently use the word \"obsessive\" to describe him, though they mean it with respect. What about his interviewees? Does he have over-anxious subjects who interpret his reaction to their thoughts? Confidingly, Sergeant near-whispers, \"the truth is the good ones don't\". He is known as an extremely able interviewer and interpreter of the story - skills which are arguably far more valuable to modern broadcast journalism than the print tradition of breaking the damn story. Indeed, suprisingly, he reveals himself to be a bit of a softie at heart. Though \"extremely competitive\", he hates the idea of hurting anyone, be they the competition or the subject of the story. \"When John Major was prime minister, there was a slight feeling that he was calling out for help at some points and I found that much more difficult to cope with because then my emotions are engaged. \"I want to be able to go into an interview with the prime minister and hit them with the strongest punch I can, then hit them with a really strong follow-up question and then move on. \"It's not 'get this story and make my reputation and they'll have to resign'.

      "body": "<p>Behind the plate glass doors of the Aston Martin showroom on Park Lane lies an exclusive air- conditioned world that smells of leather, reeks of money and provides temporary marble-floored garage space to a handful of the most sought after and expensive motors in the world. The Newport Pagnell-based company produces just 650 cars a year, most of which are sold to princes, playboys, sheiks and the super-rich, and Aston has provided a showroom in which such distinguished punters will feel at home. </p> <p>Last week however, when Mike Tyson popped into this elegant oasis for a peek at an Aston accompanied by his entourage and half of Fleet Street, the \"sales specialists\" (the company is far too posh to employ straightforward salesmen) were faced with an unfamiliar dilemma. What do you do when someone with a wallet bursting with cash, a love of British sports cars, a rape conviction and a record of violent crime walks in and says he wants to buy one of your cars? Do you sell him the car and have your distinguished marque associated with the \"World's Baddest Man\", or do you preserve the firm's good name and tell him, sorry, but has he thought about a Jaguar? </p> <p>Actually, you don't become an Aston Martin sales specialist without being smarter than that. Tyson was told that the model he was interested in, a V8 Vantage, a snip at \u00a3189,950, \"did not conform to emission standards in the United States\". The power of the Vantage's 5.3 litre, twin-supercharged engine is such that it is indeed only available in markets \"where legislation allows\". </p> <p>Remarkably, given Tyson's attitude to US motoring law - he was jailed for a road-rage attack last year - this dissuaded the former heavyweight world champion. (For McLaren it was easier: when Tyson inquired about the \u00a3600,000 F1, they could honestly tell him that no more would be made.) </p> <p>Publically, Aston Martin expressed ambivalence about the prospect of Iron Mike purchasing one of their cars. \"Were Mike Tyson to buy an Aston Martin we wouldn't think 'oh great', but neither would we be throwing our head in our hands at the prospect,\" says spokeswoman Barbara Prince. \"While we certainly would never condone any criminal act, we are simply the manufacturer and would never seek to intervene.\" </p> <p>It's fair to assume however that a firm that counts Prince Charles among its customers and is quietly content to be associated with James Bond, can do without being associated with the man labelled by one paper last week as \"London's most shameful tourist\". </p> <p> The question of celebrity endorsements is a difficult one for car companies. Many major manufacturers have embraced the idea, banking on the notion that a star can raise the profile and perception of a mass-produced model in a way that can not be achieved by stressing the merits of the actual vehicle. Citro\u00ebn recently ran a campaign for the Xsara featuring Claudia Schiffer, Vauxhall enlisted the help of Ruby Wax for their Corsa ads, while Renault reinforced the success of the Nicole campaign for the Clio by marrying her off to Bob Mortimer. </p> <p>Such tactics are all very well if you can guarantee your celebs are not about to be mired in scandal. Volkswagen received yards of publicity when they loaned Tara Palmer-Tompkinson a new Beetle, but since the party girl checked into rehab for treatment for drug and alcohol dependency, their PR department is eager to remind journalists that she only had the car for a week, and under the normal conditions of a test-drive. As Julia Hobsbawm of Hobsbawm Macaulay PR says, \"A celebrity is only of any use until they get into a scandal, and then they're nothing but trouble.\" </p> <p>Public relations guru Max Clifford says Aston Martin would be well advised to resist any further attempts by Tyson to buy one of their cars. \"Such is the reputation of the man that it could be embarrassing to them, given the controversy he attracts. There's no doubt that such controversy in boxing means bums on seats, but it wouldn't do much for Aston Martin.\" As befits the acknowledged master of turning even the most appalling reputation to a client's advantage Clifford says that despite Tyson's dubious record he might yet be a suitable candidate to endorse a certain type of car. </p> <p>\"If I was working for a car company which wanted to market a fast and dangerous car, then I might be saying 'Mike, drive our car.' It would have to be someone willing to take a risk, but such a model would be in keeping with the man. Having said that, I can't think of a car company that would take such a chance.\"</p> <p>Porsche avoid such risks altogether by avoiding any direct connection with celebrities.

      "bodyText": "Behind the plate glass doors of the Aston Martin showroom on Park Lane lies an exclusive air- conditioned world that smells of leather, reeks of money and provides temporary marble-floored garage space to a handful of the most sought after and expensive motors in the world. The Newport Pagnell-based company produces just 650 cars a year, most of which are sold to princes, playboys, sheiks and the super-rich, and Aston has provided a showroom in which such distinguished punters will feel at home. Last week however, when Mike Tyson popped into this elegant oasis for a peek at an Aston accompanied by his entourage and half of Fleet Street, the \"sales specialists\" (the company is far too posh to employ straightforward salesmen) were faced with an unfamiliar dilemma. What do you do when someone with a wallet bursting with cash, a love of British sports cars, a rape conviction and a record of violent crime walks in and says he wants to buy one of your cars? Do you sell him the car and have your distinguished marque associated with the \"World's Baddest Man\", or do you preserve the firm's good name and tell him, sorry, but has he thought about a Jaguar? Actually, you don't become an Aston Martin sales specialist without being smarter than that. Tyson was told that the model he was interested in, a V8 Vantage, a snip at \u00a3189,950, \"did not conform to emission standards in the United States\". The power of the Vantage's 5.3 litre, twin-supercharged engine is such that it is indeed only available in markets \"where legislation allows\". Remarkably, given Tyson's attitude to US motoring law - he was jailed for a road-rage attack last year - this dissuaded the former heavyweight world champion. (For McLaren it was easier: when Tyson inquired about the \u00a3600,000 F1, they could honestly tell him that no more would be made.) Publically, Aston Martin expressed ambivalence about the prospect of Iron Mike purchasing one of their cars. \"Were Mike Tyson to buy an Aston Martin we wouldn't think 'oh great', but neither would we be throwing our head in our hands at the prospect,\" says spokeswoman Barbara Prince. \"While we certainly would never condone any criminal act, we are simply the manufacturer and would never seek to intervene.\" It's fair to assume however that a firm that counts Prince Charles among its customers and is quietly content to be associated with James Bond, can do without being associated with the man labelled by one paper last week as \"London's most shameful tourist\". The question of celebrity endorsements is a difficult one for car companies. Many major manufacturers have embraced the idea, banking on the notion that a star can raise the profile and perception of a mass-produced model in a way that can not be achieved by stressing the merits of the actual vehicle. Citro\u00ebn recently ran a campaign for the Xsara featuring Claudia Schiffer, Vauxhall enlisted the help of Ruby Wax for their Corsa ads, while Renault reinforced the success of the Nicole campaign for the Clio by marrying her off to Bob Mortimer. Such tactics are all very well if you can guarantee your celebs are not about to be mired in scandal. Volkswagen received yards of publicity when they loaned Tara Palmer-Tompkinson a new Beetle, but since the party girl checked into rehab for treatment for drug and alcohol dependency, their PR department is eager to remind journalists that she only had the car for a week, and under the normal conditions of a test-drive. As Julia Hobsbawm of Hobsbawm Macaulay PR says, \"A celebrity is only of any use until they get into a scandal, and then they're nothing but trouble.\" Public relations guru Max Clifford says Aston Martin would be well advised to resist any further attempts by Tyson to buy one of their cars. \"Such is the reputation of the man that it could be embarrassing to them, given the controversy he attracts. There's no doubt that such controversy in boxing means bums on seats, but it wouldn't do much for Aston Martin.\" As befits the acknowledged master of turning even the most appalling reputation to a client's advantage Clifford says that despite Tyson's dubious record he might yet be a suitable candidate to endorse a certain type of car. \"If I was working for a car company which wanted to market a fast and dangerous car, then I might be saying 'Mike, drive our car.' It would have to be someone willing to take a risk, but such a model would be in keeping with the man. Having said that, I can't think of a car company that would take such a chance.\" Porsche avoid such risks altogether by avoiding any direct connection with celebrities. According to James Pillar of their UK marketing division, they would never attempt stop someone buying a Porsche. \"We wouldn't stop someone from buying our car on the basis of their reputation, we wouldn't be that arrogant,\" he says. \"If Mike Tyson wanted to buy a car from us we would be delighted to sell him one, although we would advise him to purchase the car in America, where Porsches are available to American specifications. \"We are asked almost on a monthly basis by tabloid newspapers to provide them with the names of celebrity Porsche owners, and we only ever give the name of someone who has already publically expressed their preference for a Porsche,\" he says. \"We're a small manufacturer and we can't afford to provide fleets of our cars to celebrities. We sell just 3,500 cars a year in the UK - we operate in a niche within a niche. Having said that we do have many celebrity customers,\" concludes Pillar, demonstrating a canny knack of having it both ways. Ferrari are similarly reticent about their celebrity owners, perhaps unsuprisingly given that three of the most high-profile - David Beckham, Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke - all found themselves in court in the last three months for various motoring misdemeanours. Such associations are a predictable consequence of appealing to the rich and occasionally reckless, but by refusing to offer an opinion, Ferrari at least limit the damage such events cause to their glossy reputation.

If choice is too much for us, we'll lose it, and the risk for the brand managers is that they assume that we don't really want choice. But there is a more powerful force than advertising or customer databases - it is called word of mouth. A film can become a cult success because people tell their friends about it. You can choose one internet provider over another because someone you like tells you its OK. You can decide not to buy, not to take a particular holiday, as a result of talking to your friends and relations. This process can be understood but can't be predicted with any degree of certainty. It will continue to undermine brands in all kinds of subtle ways - and means that we may well continue to be spoilt for choice. Bridget Rosewell is chairman of Volterra Consulting",

      "body": "<p>The first blink-and-you-won't-miss-it shock advert of the year caught the public's attention as soon as it was launched on Friday. Initially intended to run in the Saturday and Sunday supplements of most broadsheet newspapers, it caused such a fuss within three hours of its appearance that the charity who commissioned it - Barnardo's - began trying to persuade politicians such as Mo Mowlam to offer verbal support. </p> <p>It's an advert based on the sort of solid truth that flashes through your mind every time you hand over 50p to a beggar - that everyone is born an innocent baby, and what is it that goes so wrong as to put that little ball of trust and love out on the Strand at midnight? </p> <p>Indeed, you've probably seen earlier adverts in the campaign already. One shows a three-year-old child about to jump off a multi-storey car park. Another shows a small boy slumped on the street under a dingy bridge. Yet another features a little girl in a sleeping bag in a rain-soaked high street. All carry wording similar to that in the latest ad: \"Battered as a child, it was always possible that John would turn to drugs. With Barnardo's help, child abuse need not lead to an empty future. Although we no longer run orphanages, we continue to help thousands of children and their families.\" </p> <p>Of course, the baby wasn't hurt in making of the advert. His face was a composite of him sitting in a studio and his mouth wrestling with a huge bar of chocolate. The child's image was superimposed on the grimy surroundings. It was all very clever. Should we be at all bothered? It is surely a laudable aim for a worthwhile charity to use state-of-the-art advertising practice at one of Britain's leading agencies - Levi's agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty - to raise funds to help children. </p> <p>It's not as if Barnardo's is the first charity to be attacked for its advertising. In November 1998 the RSPCA launched a hard-hitting anti-fox hunting campaign showing a fox having its bowels ripped out by a pack of dogs under the line: \"Whatever else you think about foxes, you have to admire their guts.\" </p> <p>Other RSPCA campaigns have featured a harrowing photograph of a dog with its jaw hanging loose, its mouth half open in a grimace of pain and its left eye hanging out of its socket; a dead horse hanging from a meathook; and a pile of dead dogs. </p> <p>In October 1995, environmental pressure groups and charities, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, were criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority for making overzealous and exaggerated claims. In September 1998, the Commission for Racial Equality ran three overtly racist ads, building up to the catchline: \"What was worse? This ad, or your failure to complain?\" The organisation suffered weeks of flak from politicians and newspapers alike. </p> <p>The problem Barnardo's faces is that the advertising industry is becoming increasingly divided over the use of such powerful images. Last week David Abbott, the founder of the UK's largest advertising agency, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, attacked the Advertiser of the Year award to French Connection UK for its fcuk campaign. </p> <p>\"Fcuking great idea to put fcuking four-letter words on fcuking big posters where every fcuking eight-year-old can see them,\" he wrote, in a letter to Campaign, the magazine that sponsors the awards. \"What a fcuking cool way to get up the noses of those fcuking parent and teacher tossers who are trying to bring their kids up as fcuking goody-goodies. That's the way to sell a youth brand, though haven't I seen it fcuking before on the lav walls?\" </p> <p>Abbott has become something of a champion of gentler publicity and has spoken out against shock advertising on a number of occasions. Gradually, elements of the industry are coming round to his point of view, many of them because they fear a Labour government could bring in legal rules to an industry that is currently self-regulated. </p> <p>It is in this climate that the Committee for Advertising Practice - which writes the rules that the Advertising Standards Authority enforces - moved extremely fast on Friday morning by ruling that the Barnardo's advert was likely to cause offence. The CAP issued an ad alert, advising the media not to carry it. </p> <p>As the campaign was booked into many Saturday and Sunday supplements, most of the magazines had gone to press before the warning was issued. The agency had booked the advert into the Guardian, the Observer, the Independent, the Independent on Sunday and the Daily Telegraph. The Mail had previously refused the advert but agreed to carry an earlier version. </p> <p>Barnardo's fought the ruling, arguing that the CAP was wrong to invoke two clauses on offence and sensitivity. It said that other CAP clauses suggested that, since the charity's motives were pure, the environment for the advert was mature and the advert was unlikely to encourage three-month-old babies to use heroin, the ban was unnecessary. </p> <p>\"This execution has been carefully planned and considered,\" says Andrew Nebel, Barnardo's director of marketing and communications. \"We have invested over a year in this campaign, during which time it was researched, and at no time did our findings give us cause for concern that our audience found it unduly shocking or distressing.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, one of the reasons Barnardo's has turned to this form of advertising is that it needs to draw itself to our attention. After all, in charity terms it's in something of a brand graveyard. Apart from the old donors who have been donating to Barnardo's on the understanding that it runs those children's homes where everyone gets long country rambles and healthy breakfasts, few members of the British public seem to think the charity has any function now that Queen Victoria is dead. </p> <p>\"We're a well-known charity,\" explains Nebel. \"We've been around for 130 years, but if you ask people what we do they still think we run orphanages, something we've been disengaging from since the 60s. We now work in the community to help children stay with their family and friends and hopefully help them meet the threats which could end up putting them on the streets or turning them to drugs when they are older. Whenever you see a homeless person and sniff that it's all their own fault, it's worth remembering that it was probably something in their childhood that pushed them into it.\" </p> <p>But is an image of a baby with a syringe really appropriate for a high-profile rebranding strategy? Isn't there a danger that cash-laden punters will be so turned off by the horror of the message that they will turn from the charity in disgust, withholding any potential payment? </p> <p>\"If you accepted that argument you would only cater to the lowest common sensitivity,\" says John O'Keeffe, creative director at Bartle Bogle Hegarty. \"I don't think anyone would be served by advertising that only exists within parameters set down by Mary Whitehouse. When I used to work on the NSPCC account, I'd actually see the police surgeons' log books and, let me assure you, the truth is so much worse than anything you or I could imagine. We do shield people from the worst of it, but I don't think the population should be shielded from everything bad that happens in the world.\" </p> <p>But what about the oldest problem in advertising?

      "bodyText": "The first blink-and-you-won't-miss-it shock advert of the year caught the public's attention as soon as it was launched on Friday. Initially intended to run in the Saturday and Sunday supplements of most broadsheet newspapers, it caused such a fuss within three hours of its appearance that the charity who commissioned it - Barnardo's - began trying to persuade politicians such as Mo Mowlam to offer verbal support. It's an advert based on the sort of solid truth that flashes through your mind every time you hand over 50p to a beggar - that everyone is born an innocent baby, and what is it that goes so wrong as to put that little ball of trust and love out on the Strand at midnight? Indeed, you've probably seen earlier adverts in the campaign already. One shows a three-year-old child about to jump off a multi-storey car park. Another shows a small boy slumped on the street under a dingy bridge. Yet another features a little girl in a sleeping bag in a rain-soaked high street. All carry wording similar to that in the latest ad: \"Battered as a child, it was always possible that John would turn to drugs. With Barnardo's help, child abuse need not lead to an empty future. Although we no longer run orphanages, we continue to help thousands of children and their families.\" Of course, the baby wasn't hurt in making of the advert. His face was a composite of him sitting in a studio and his mouth wrestling with a huge bar of chocolate. The child's image was superimposed on the grimy surroundings. It was all very clever. Should we be at all bothered? It is surely a laudable aim for a worthwhile charity to use state-of-the-art advertising practice at one of Britain's leading agencies - Levi's agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty - to raise funds to help children. It's not as if Barnardo's is the first charity to be attacked for its advertising. In November 1998 the RSPCA launched a hard-hitting anti-fox hunting campaign showing a fox having its bowels ripped out by a pack of dogs under the line: \"Whatever else you think about foxes, you have to admire their guts.\" Other RSPCA campaigns have featured a harrowing photograph of a dog with its jaw hanging loose, its mouth half open in a grimace of pain and its left eye hanging out of its socket; a dead horse hanging from a meathook; and a pile of dead dogs. In October 1995, environmental pressure groups and charities, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, were criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority for making overzealous and exaggerated claims. In September 1998, the Commission for Racial Equality ran three overtly racist ads, building up to the catchline: \"What was worse? This ad, or your failure to complain?\" The organisation suffered weeks of flak from politicians and newspapers alike. The problem Barnardo's faces is that the advertising industry is becoming increasingly divided over the use of such powerful images. Last week David Abbott, the founder of the UK's largest advertising agency, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, attacked the Advertiser of the Year award to French Connection UK for its fcuk campaign. \"Fcuking great idea to put fcuking four-letter words on fcuking big posters where every fcuking eight-year-old can see them,\" he wrote, in a letter to Campaign, the magazine that sponsors the awards. \"What a fcuking cool way to get up the noses of those fcuking parent and teacher tossers who are trying to bring their kids up as fcuking goody-goodies. That's the way to sell a youth brand, though haven't I seen it fcuking before on the lav walls?\" Abbott has become something of a champion of gentler publicity and has spoken out against shock advertising on a number of occasions. Gradually, elements of the industry are coming round to his point of view, many of them because they fear a Labour government could bring in legal rules to an industry that is currently self-regulated. It is in this climate that the Committee for Advertising Practice - which writes the rules that the Advertising Standards Authority enforces - moved extremely fast on Friday morning by ruling that the Barnardo's advert was likely to cause offence. The CAP issued an ad alert, advising the media not to carry it. As the campaign was booked into many Saturday and Sunday supplements, most of the magazines had gone to press before the warning was issued. The agency had booked the advert into the Guardian, the Observer, the Independent, the Independent on Sunday and the Daily Telegraph. The Mail had previously refused the advert but agreed to carry an earlier version. Barnardo's fought the ruling, arguing that the CAP was wrong to invoke two clauses on offence and sensitivity. It said that other CAP clauses suggested that, since the charity's motives were pure, the environment for the advert was mature and the advert was unlikely to encourage three-month-old babies to use heroin, the ban was unnecessary. \"This execution has been carefully planned and considered,\" says Andrew Nebel, Barnardo's director of marketing and communications. \"We have invested over a year in this campaign, during which time it was researched, and at no time did our findings give us cause for concern that our audience found it unduly shocking or distressing.\" Nonetheless, one of the reasons Barnardo's has turned to this form of advertising is that it needs to draw itself to our attention. After all, in charity terms it's in something of a brand graveyard. Apart from the old donors who have been donating to Barnardo's on the understanding that it runs those children's homes where everyone gets long country rambles and healthy breakfasts, few members of the British public seem to think the charity has any function now that Queen Victoria is dead. \"We're a well-known charity,\" explains Nebel. \"We've been around for 130 years, but if you ask people what we do they still think we run orphanages, something we've been disengaging from since the 60s. We now work in the community to help children stay with their family and friends and hopefully help them meet the threats which could end up putting them on the streets or turning them to drugs when they are older. Whenever you see a homeless person and sniff that it's all their own fault, it's worth remembering that it was probably something in their childhood that pushed them into it.\" But is an image of a baby with a syringe really appropriate for a high-profile rebranding strategy? Isn't there a danger that cash-laden punters will be so turned off by the horror of the message that they will turn from the charity in disgust, withholding any potential payment? \"If you accepted that argument you would only cater to the lowest common sensitivity,\" says John O'Keeffe, creative director at Bartle Bogle Hegarty. \"I don't think anyone would be served by advertising that only exists within parameters set down by Mary Whitehouse. When I used to work on the NSPCC account, I'd actually see the police surgeons' log books and, let me assure you, the truth is so much worse than anything you or I could imagine. We do shield people from the worst of it, but I don't think the population should be shielded from everything bad that happens in the world.\" But what about the oldest problem in advertising? That people will remember the shocking image of baby and needle but forget who used it and what they used it for? After all, monster.co.uk is using images of children to flog job adverts on the internet. Won't the messenger be drowned by the message? \"Our work is a medium-term job,\" O'Keeffe says. \"It takes time but when people hear 'Vorsprung durch Technik' they don't think of Ford. And this sort of advertising works. Again when I worked on the NSPCC, we ran what were considered shocking ads, but we managed to raise a lot of money through those ads which the NSPCC put to very good use. I think the results will bear this campaign out.\" Finally, of course, there are those that think this sort of charity activity has gone way too far and yearn for a quieter and more respectful age. What, for example, would Dr Barnardo think? Well, considering that the combative Dr Barnardo set up one of the UK's first photographic studios in order to develop his pictures of starving, homeless children - which he shoved in middle-class faces as part of his shock-tactic fund raising - one imagines the good doctor would approve wholeheartedly.",

Newsnight is 20 years old and Paxman is fronting the programme dedicated to its impact. He reads the letter, laughs and puts it to one side. A lot of people hate Jeremy Paxman. A lot of them write to him to tell him so. You've got to laugh, haven't you? </p> <p>Paxman sits in his small, airless office to the side of the main Newsnight newsroom. Today he is pre-occupied with the changes to the RUC being announced by Peter Mandelson. He watches the monitor transmitting prime minister's questions, grumping and raising his eyebrows as one political platitude is followed by another. \"That's crap,\" he says at one point and it's not clear whether he's talking about the PM or some other issue burning a hole in his intellect. Either way, Tony Blair is probably well aware that Paxman thinks a lot of things are crap. </p> <p>Newsnight has been called many things. An important part of the democratic process (Will Hutton); a traitor in our midst (the Sun); dangerous (Margaret Thatcher); increasingly irrelevant (Alastair Campbell). Newsnight made Paxman a household name, from attacks for \"sneering interviews\" (Sir John Birt) to that Michael Howard encounter. </p> <p>From its start in 1980, Newsnight also made itself a household name - from the Falklands to Arthur Scargill tripping up Peter Snow, from Vincent Hanna at the Darlington by-election to the sandpit of the Gulf war, from the meltdown of the Tories to New Labour's control machine. </p> <p>Cajoling, intimidating, aggressive, revealing, persistent. Paxman, Kirsty Wark and Jeremy Vine - the unholy triumvirate, the interviewers from hell. Howard says it sacrifices light for a lot of heat; Sin Kevill, the present editor, admits it was once all too \"macho and Oxbridge\". But it's still there, a needle in the thigh of the establishment. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, there are two establishment figures who won't be featuring in the anniversary programme. Outgoing BBC director general John Birt was asked to appear, took an age to reply, couldn't work out a time and \"sort of drifted out of the mix\", according to one source. Birt is known not to like Newsnight's interrogatory style, preferring the \"let people explain\" culture of interviews. The fact that he isn't in the programme, and the new director general, Greg Dyke, is, says volumes for the relationship between Birt and the BBC's top news programme. </p> <p>\"Will I be glad to see the back of John Birt?\" Paxman says. \"That is rather a 'When did you stop beating your wife?' type of question. I've met the guy a few times; I don't think he's my greatest fan.\" And Paxman isn't Birt's either because Paxman isn't a man who likes structures and Birtist strategy meetings and focus group management. </p> <p>\"I firmly believe this organisation only has any raison d' etre if it lives on ideas,\" Paxman says. \"It doesn't live on structures, or editorial chains of command. It lives on ideas, and clever, talented people who ought to be given their head. Frankly, I can't see any other justification for the licence fee apart from creating an environment where people can create.\" </p> <p>The other notable absence from the programme is the clip that put Newsnight into the headlines for weeks in October 1998. Times columnist Matthew Parris was being interviewed by Paxman about the resignation of Ron Davies, the former Welsh secretary, who indulged in a \"moment of madness\" on Clapham Common. Parris suddenly said that there were members of the cabinet who were gay and, when asked by Paxman, yes, one of them was Peter Mandelson. </p> <p>Paxman quickly and inelegantly changed the subject, probably sensing that this was going to cause an almighty stink. And it did. All sorts of allegations flew around: that Paxman and Parris had cooked up the wheeze to \"out\" Mandelson; that Paxman's note of apology to Mandelson was rebuffed; that the BBC handled it as well as an elephant playing baseball. </p> <p>The BBC high command sent out a memo following the incident warning editors and presenters not to mention it. This caused another row. \"I thought the BBC dealt with it ludicrously,\" Paxman says. \"It revealed the flat-footed and heavy-handed way that bureaucracies have, it made the whole issue that much bigger than it actually would have been.\" </p> <p>Many criticised Paxman for writing to Mandelson - something which seemed to smack of special treatment for the former secretary of state for trade and industry. \"I don't socialise with politicians but Mandelson is one of the few people that I do bump into socially because we have mutual friends. I did feel that it was unfortunate. What the letter said was that I took the view that people's private lives are their own affair unless they make it a public issue and I hope that he accepted that.\" And Mandelson's reportedly prickly response? \"You would have to ask him about that.\" </p> <p>The fact that the clip has been omitted has led some to the obvious conclusion: censorship. \"I can't see any reason why it shouldn't [be in the programme],\" Paxman says. \"I don't think it was our greatest hour and it was rather a mistake. I think there is a good argument for putting it in. But in the 20 years there are loads of things that are much more dramatic. Actually-\" He pauses, a long Paxman pause that leaves you wondering if he's forgotten you're there. \"I don't think it should be in. By comparison with things like the spat over the Falklands or the Gulf or the Michael Howard interview, those things strike me as things that Newsnight did as opposed to that particular moment.\" </p> <p>Senior staff on Newsnight considered the Mandelson clip but knew it would entail a huge fight with the dead hand of BBC bureaucracy. \"It just wasn't something it was worth fighting for,\" said a source. \"There was so much other ground to cover.\" </p> <p>Alastair Campbell once said that Newsnight was becoming increasingly irrelevant because of its \"dwindling\" audience. \"That's balls,\" is Paxman's succinct reply. Indeed. Newsnight has had a good year. Viewing figures are up 8% to 1.1m as the public searches out more serious analysis in a world of increasing consumer news. </p> <p>Kevill, who oversaw the programme's relaunch last January, says it now has a broader, more accessible agenda - from the documentary-style films from a Salford housing estate to arts and culture - but not at the expense of depth. \"I'm quite traditional,\" she says. \"I prefer three items in the programme rather than four. It gives more time.\" The scrapping of News at Ten has also been a factor. </p> <p>One part of the \"accessibility\" package was the surprising announcement that Nicky Campbell, former host of Wheel of Fortune and Radio 5 presenter, was to join the team. Was Paxman surprised when he heard the announcement last August? \"No.\" Why not? \"Because someone had phoned me to tell me about it.\" He pauses. He knows he's not answering the question. Was he surprised? \"Mind your own business.\" There is another long pause. \"I think he is very good on radio.\" </p> <p>There is the rub. Many Newsnight staff were unhappy at what they saw as the overpromotion of Campbell's role when it was revealed in Media Guardian last year. Campbell's press people insisted it was a presenting role; BBC sources said it would be a few outside broadcasts. Whatever the agreement, it looks like it's coming to an end. Campbell is deemed not to have fitted in with the tough, journalist-led ethic of the programme. Senior staff say he'll probably do a couple more packages before saying farewell. </p> <p>Paxman has the weary air of a man who works long and hard in an organisation famed for its inability to use one manager where eight could do the job less effectively. The rest of the Newsnight team suffer the same. Last week the BBC announced it was ridding itself of the nine \"super-editors\" it had put in place less than two years earlier to \"increase communication\" between television and radio news - another step along the dreaded route of bi-media. Paxman hated the idea of \"super-editors\" then, and sees the U-turn as embarrassing but necessary. </p> <p>\"Another inspired decision. This whole thing has been built, this great news centre palace.\" He waves his hands towards the new news and current affairs floor outside his office. \"The World Tonight [Radio 4] sits over there, we sit over here and there is not a great deal of cross- fertilisation. The super-editors thing was a stupid idea which has been recognised as a stupid idea. It is unfortunate that it took two years for that to happen. </p> <p>\"I still believe that this is a fantastic organisation if you treat it like a publisher. But if you decide to spend your time concerned with the politics of it, that is a recipe for self-destruction.\" </p> <p>But not concerning yourself with the politics of the BBC is like a golfer not concerning herself with that big bunker just before the 18th green. It's just there, always getting in the way. Take the Scottish and Welsh opt-outs from the main Newsnight programme at 11pm. </p> <p>\"It's a problem,\" Paxman, who once called it a \"damn fool idea\", admits. \"Instead of dealing with a 45-minute canvas what you have is a 30-minute programme plus a 10- or 15-minute appendix. It is not the case that this merely affects viewers in Scotland, who are deprived of the last 15 minutes of the programme. It affects the whole make-up of the programme. </p> <p>\"The thing was cooked up as a bureaucratic way of buying off the demand for a Scottish six o'clock news, and the sooner it's dead and buried, the better.\" </p> <p>Does Paxman ever think that he should change his style to something more amenable to the caring, sharing new millennium? Of course he doesn't. \"Any self-respecting journalist must be concerned to define for themselves what the important issue is and then to pursue it and not blindly to follow some line laid down by the vested interest in question,\" he says. \"I wouldn't want to work for a programme that didn't have that policy.\" </p> <p>The programme's role as the nagger of the nation's conscience is becoming all the more important as viewers and listeners are increasingly overwhelmed by rolling news which, of necessity, lacks the one thing Newsnight has - context. \"There is a lack of analysis and generally finding out if people are telling the truth,\" Paxman says. \"Things rush on [to television] at a fantastic speed, get recycled, pushed out and not thought about again. The fight is about controlling what goes through that sausage machine, which is what the spin doctors are about.\" </p> <p>There have been discussions about a regular, highbrow interview programme on BBC2 for Paxman in the style of his head-to-head with Bill Gates. Broadcast magazine reported last week that he has drawn up a wish list of people he would like to interview - Hillary Clinton, Rupert Murdoch, Steven Spielberg. But that doesn't mean he's retiring. </p> <p>\"Assuredly someone will come along at some stage and say, 'Let's get rid of this bloke,'\" he says. \"'Let's get someone who's younger, older, different sex, different race.' I don't suppose that one will go on for ever. </p> <p>\"I love it. Even on days when it is very thin, when you are trying to make bricks without straw, it is tremendous fun. The thought that you're being paid to do what's not really a proper job is fantastic. I've no plans to shuffle off this mortal coil yet.\" Happy birthday, Newsnight. </p> <p><strong>History in the making</strong></p> <p><strong> Falklands war (1982)</strong> </p> <p>Peter Snow caused a storm of protest for prefacing his report with the statement that it was the British government's version rather than simply the truth. </p> <p>\u0095 \"There are traitors in our midst. What is it but treason to talk on TV, as Peter Snow talks, questioning whether the government's version of the sea battles was to be believed?\" - The Sun</p> <p>\u0095 \"We were all surprised that . . . laying out the facts for people to make up their own minds, should be misconstrued as something that was essentially traitorous.\" - Tony Hall, BBC News chief executive and ex-Newsnight producer </p> <p><strong> Darlington by-election (1983)</strong> </p> <p>Vincent Hanna launched the political sketch on TV by tailing SDP candidate Tony Cook. Labour won by a landslide, much of it put down to Hanna's merciless treatment of Cook. </p> <p>\u0095 \"I was always aware of Vincent hovering. He was either participating by trying to get an interview or he was just around. And I felt at one stage that he was actually trying to intimidate me.\" -Tony Cook </p> <p><strong> Arthur Scargill interview (1984)</strong> </p> <p>Arthur Scargill asks Peter Snow if he has read the full text of a speech he made in Moscow. Snow says yes, but under questioning later in the interview admits he hasn't. </p> <p>\u0095 \"It was a major personal disaster. It was disgraceful. I didn't do my homework.\" - Peter Snow </p> <p><strong> Michael Howard interview (1997)</strong> </p> <p>Jeremy Paxman asks Michael Howard the same question 14 times over the Derek Lewis prison affair. Paxman says he persevered because his producer said the next tape wasn't ready. </p> <p>MH: I was entitled to express my views. I was entitled to be consulted. </p> <p>JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? </p> <p>MH: I was not entitled to instruct Derek Lewis and I did not instruct him. And the truth of it is . . . JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? </p> <p>MH: And the truth of the matter is Mr Marriott was not suspended. I did not . . . </p> <p>JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? </p> <p>MH: I did not overrule Derek Lewis. </p> <p>JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? </p> <p>MH: I took advice on what I could and could not do . . . </p> <p>JP: Did you threaten to overrule him, Mr Howard? </p> <p>MH: . . . and I acted scrupulously in accordance with that. </p> <p>\u0095 \"I realised it hadn't been the best interview I'd ever given, but it's not entirely uncommon for a politician not to answer a question directly. It's pretty uncommon for them to be asked the same question.\" - Michael Howard <br><strong>Carolyne Ellis</strong></p> <p> <strong>Newsnight at 20 is on BBC2 at 5.50pm on Saturday January 29</strong></p>",

This caused another row. \"I thought the BBC dealt with it ludicrously,\" Paxman says. \"It revealed the flat-footed and heavy-handed way that bureaucracies have, it made the whole issue that much bigger than it actually would have been.\" Many criticised Paxman for writing to Mandelson - something which seemed to smack of special treatment for the former secretary of state for trade and industry. \"I don't socialise with politicians but Mandelson is one of the few people that I do bump into socially because we have mutual friends. I did feel that it was unfortunate. What the letter said was that I took the view that people's private lives are their own affair unless they make it a public issue and I hope that he accepted that.\" And Mandelson's reportedly prickly response? \"You would have to ask him about that.\" The fact that the clip has been omitted has led some to the obvious conclusion: censorship. \"I can't see any reason why it shouldn't [be in the programme],\" Paxman says. \"I don't think it was our greatest hour and it was rather a mistake. I think there is a good argument for putting it in. But in the 20 years there are loads of things that are much more dramatic. Actually-\" He pauses, a long Paxman pause that leaves you wondering if he's forgotten you're there. \"I don't think it should be in. By comparison with things like the spat over the Falklands or the Gulf or the Michael Howard interview, those things strike me as things that Newsnight did as opposed to that particular moment.\" Senior staff on Newsnight considered the Mandelson clip but knew it would entail a huge fight with the dead hand of BBC bureaucracy. \"It just wasn't something it was worth fighting for,\" said a source. \"There was so much other ground to cover.\" Alastair Campbell once said that Newsnight was becoming increasingly irrelevant because of its \"dwindling\" audience. \"That's balls,\" is Paxman's succinct reply. Indeed. Newsnight has had a good year. Viewing figures are up 8% to 1.1m as the public searches out more serious analysis in a world of increasing consumer news. Kevill, who oversaw the programme's relaunch last January, says it now has a broader, more accessible agenda - from the documentary-style films from a Salford housing estate to arts and culture - but not at the expense of depth. \"I'm quite traditional,\" she says. \"I prefer three items in the programme rather than four. It gives more time.\" The scrapping of News at Ten has also been a factor. One part of the \"accessibility\" package was the surprising announcement that Nicky Campbell, former host of Wheel of Fortune and Radio 5 presenter, was to join the team. Was Paxman surprised when he heard the announcement last August? \"No.\" Why not? \"Because someone had phoned me to tell me about it.\" He pauses. He knows he's not answering the question. Was he surprised? \"Mind your own business.\" There is another long pause. \"I think he is very good on radio.\" There is the rub. Many Newsnight staff were unhappy at what they saw as the overpromotion of Campbell's role when it was revealed in Media Guardian last year. Campbell's press people insisted it was a presenting role; BBC sources said it would be a few outside broadcasts. Whatever the agreement, it looks like it's coming to an end. Campbell is deemed not to have fitted in with the tough, journalist-led ethic of the programme. Senior staff say he'll probably do a couple more packages before saying farewell. Paxman has the weary air of a man who works long and hard in an organisation famed for its inability to use one manager where eight could do the job less effectively. The rest of the Newsnight team suffer the same. Last week the BBC announced it was ridding itself of the nine \"super-editors\" it had put in place less than two years earlier to \"increase communication\" between television and radio news - another step along the dreaded route of bi-media. Paxman hated the idea of \"super-editors\" then, and sees the U-turn as embarrassing but necessary. \"Another inspired decision. This whole thing has been built, this great news centre palace.\" He waves his hands towards the new news and current affairs floor outside his office. \"The World Tonight [Radio 4] sits over there, we sit over here and there is not a great deal of cross- fertilisation. The super-editors thing was a stupid idea which has been recognised as a stupid idea. It is unfortunate that it took two years for that to happen. \"I still believe that this is a fantastic organisation if you treat it like a publisher. But if you decide to spend your time concerned with the politics of it, that is a recipe for self-destruction.\" But not concerning yourself with the politics of the BBC is like a golfer not concerning herself with that big bunker just before the 18th green. It's just there, always getting in the way. Take the Scottish and Welsh opt-outs from the main Newsnight programme at 11pm. \"It's a problem,\" Paxman, who once called it a \"damn fool idea\", admits. \"Instead of dealing with a 45-minute canvas what you have is a 30-minute programme plus a 10- or 15-minute appendix. It is not the case that this merely affects viewers in Scotland, who are deprived of the last 15 minutes of the programme. It affects the whole make-up of the programme. \"The thing was cooked up as a bureaucratic way of buying off the demand for a Scottish six o'clock news, and the sooner it's dead and buried, the better.\" Does Paxman ever think that he should change his style to something more amenable to the caring, sharing new millennium? Of course he doesn't. \"Any self-respecting journalist must be concerned to define for themselves what the important issue is and then to pursue it and not blindly to follow some line laid down by the vested interest in question,\" he says. \"I wouldn't want to work for a programme that didn't have that policy.\" The programme's role as the nagger of the nation's conscience is becoming all the more important as viewers and listeners are increasingly overwhelmed by rolling news which, of necessity, lacks the one thing Newsnight has - context. \"There is a lack of analysis and generally finding out if people are telling the truth,\" Paxman says. \"Things rush on [to television] at a fantastic speed, get recycled, pushed out and not thought about again. The fight is about controlling what goes through that sausage machine, which is what the spin doctors are about.\" There have been discussions about a regular, highbrow interview programme on BBC2 for Paxman in the style of his head-to-head with Bill Gates. Broadcast magazine reported last week that he has drawn up a wish list of people he would like to interview - Hillary Clinton, Rupert Murdoch, Steven Spielberg. But that doesn't mean he's retiring. \"Assuredly someone will come along at some stage and say, 'Let's get rid of this bloke,'\" he says. \"'Let's get someone who's younger, older, different sex, different race.' I don't suppose that one will go on for ever. \"I love it. Even on days when it is very thin, when you are trying to make bricks without straw, it is tremendous fun. The thought that you're being paid to do what's not really a proper job is fantastic. I've no plans to shuffle off this mortal coil yet.\" Happy birthday, Newsnight. History in the making Falklands war (1982) Peter Snow caused a storm of protest for prefacing his report with the statement that it was the British government's version rather than simply the truth. \u0095 \"There are traitors in our midst. What is it but treason to talk on TV, as Peter Snow talks, questioning whether the government's version of the sea battles was to be believed?\" - The Sun \u0095 \"We were all surprised that . . . laying out the facts for people to make up their own minds, should be misconstrued as something that was essentially traitorous.\" - Tony Hall, BBC News chief executive and ex-Newsnight producer Darlington by-election (1983) Vincent Hanna launched the political sketch on TV by tailing SDP candidate Tony Cook. Labour won by a landslide, much of it put down to Hanna's merciless treatment of Cook. \u0095 \"I was always aware of Vincent hovering. He was either participating by trying to get an interview or he was just around. And I felt at one stage that he was actually trying to intimidate me.\" -Tony Cook Arthur Scargill interview (1984) Arthur Scargill asks Peter Snow if he has read the full text of a speech he made in Moscow. Snow says yes, but under questioning later in the interview admits he hasn't. \u0095 \"It was a major personal disaster. It was disgraceful. I didn't do my homework.\" - Peter Snow Michael Howard interview (1997) Jeremy Paxman asks Michael Howard the same question 14 times over the Derek Lewis prison affair. Paxman says he persevered because his producer said the next tape wasn't ready. MH: I was entitled to express my views. I was entitled to be consulted. JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? MH: I was not entitled to instruct Derek Lewis and I did not instruct him. And the truth of it is . . . JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? MH: And the truth of the matter is Mr Marriott was not suspended. I did not . . . JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? MH: I did not overrule Derek Lewis. JP: Did you threaten to overrule him? MH: I took advice on what I could and could not do . . . JP: Did you threaten to overrule him, Mr Howard? MH: . . . and I acted scrupulously in accordance with that. \u0095 \"I realised it hadn't been the best interview I'd ever given, but it's not entirely uncommon for a politician not to answer a question directly. It's pretty uncommon for them to be asked the same question.\" - Michael Howard Carolyne Ellis Newsnight at 20 is on BBC2 at 5.50pm on Saturday January 29",

Faced with a repairs backlog of about \u00a322bn, and thousands of abandoned homes on difficult-to-let estates, councils are increasingly incapable of providing low-cost social housing, ministers believe. They are preparing to launch what insiders call a \"big bang\" under which authorities will be persuaded - and eventually forced - to offload the remaining 3.2m council homes by 2010. Internal policy papers in the department, which monitors and funds local government, show that hiving-off council housing - what critics have labelled back-door privatisation - has gained a new urgency with the treasury and Downing Street anxious to find new ways of providing affordable homes. Ministers are concerned that poorly maintained and derelict housing is further tarnishing Labour's already battered image in big cities and the party's heartlands - where the Liberal Democrats are now seriously challenging Labour. Much of the impetus for the drive will come from a new inspection regime in the environment department, in which under-performing councils with poor housing management will be told to put services out to competition. They will be threatened with spending cuts if they refuse. So far only 110, mainly smaller, authorities have transferred 360,000 houses all told to non-profit making companies and housing associations, which are funded by the government's housing corporation. But 23 councils have said they plan to transfer a total of 270,000 homes. Significantly, this includes Birmingham, England's largest council landlord, with 90,000 houses and flats. The council has a multi-billion pound repairs backlog. Under current progress, however, it will take almost 20 years to transfer all housing stock to new companies and housing associations. One adviser said: \"Ministers feel this is far too long a time-frame and that much more pressure is needed to force the pace. \"Councils increasingly will be charged with setting housing standards in their areas, but not owning and controlling houses.\" With the condition of council housing worsening by the day, authorities are unable to provide sufficient funds for modernisation. Under treasury rules, they are prevented from using assets, or future income from rents, as security to borrow on the open market. Housing associations, or new social companies, face no such restrictions. Problems have intensified since the 1980s when 1.6m homes, mainly better properties, were sold to tenants under the Conservative government's right-to-buy policy - raising \u00a37bn in the biggest privatisation of all. This has left councils with old, and poorly maintained homes on \"sink\" estates, which are proving increasingly difficult to let. While some might have to be abandoned, ministers believe that redevelopment - tied to a new image for council housing - could turn others round. That task will now fall on new companies and housing associations. The magazine Inside Housing says transferring ownership will \"kill a number of birds with one stone\". \"The government will not have to worry about the \u00a322bn albatross for putting housing right currently hanging around the taxpayer's neck.\" The only problem is that, under present guidelines, tenants have to approve hiving-off their homes in special transfer ballots, usually organised by the Electoral Reform Society. About one in 10 transfers is currently rejected. In Cambridge last year, for instance, 67% of the city's council tenants rejected the transfer option on a 72% turnout.",

It compels him to tap people's shoulders, to number his actions, to mimic others' movements - and it enslaves him to obsessive wordplay (his name becomes Unreliable Chessgrub, or Ironic Pissclam) and volcanic eruptions of speech. \"I'm an airbag in a dashboard,\" he says, \"packed up layer upon layer in readiness to explode, expand all over you, fill up every available space.\" </p> <p>Author Jonathan Lethem - a former painter, student contemporary of Bret Easton Ellis, and writer of four acclaimed novels in the past five years - has created, from what sounds like a ludicrous gimmick, one of fiction's most memorable narrators. Through Lionel - nickname Freakshow - he explores the relationship between what makes us tic and what makes us tick. \"I came across Tourette's the way anyone might,\" says the 35-year-old Lethem, \"by reading about it in Oliver Sacks. The germ of inspiration, that really freeing sense that this was an image of human life that I could inhabit, turn inside out and make my own, was right there in Sacks's essay.\" </p> <p>Lethem's interest in the condition was based not only on a psychological fascination - \"it hovered in my mind as a metaphor for that aspect of human existence that is helpless, compulsive, twitchy\" - but on a keen sense of its literary potential. \"I've always had an element of Joycean wordplay in my books, some characters who were in charge of the babbling or frothing at the mouth.

Lethem's reputation in the US is as a writer who combines and reanimates genres. Having spent his formative years at work in a second-hand bookshop, he is fiction's answer to Quentin Tarantino. He may insist that his genre-mashing is an increasingly incidental by-product of the \"omnivorous cross-genre enthusiasm in my reading\", but Motherless Brooklyn slots neatly into an oeuvre that already includes Girl in Landscape (western meets dystopia) and Gun, With Occasional Music (detective fiction meets sci-fi). </p> <p>Lethem found it natural to place his obsessively twitchy protagonist within a crime-novel plot. \"The manic pace of the detective investigation was what I needed to set off that digressive inertia of the Tourettic consciousness,\" he says. The effect is gleefully absurd, even if the formulaic gumshoe plot pales next to the twinkle-toed narrative footwork. </p> <p>\"On one level,\" Lethem says, \"the book hinges on the joke of replacing the hard-boiled narrator - who's supposed to be this Bogart figure impressing everyone with his Machiavellian control of circumstances and conversation - with this absolutely soft-boiled chaos of language.\" The out-of-control Essrog takes to an extreme what Lethem describes as \"the undermining of the traditional American male figure\" in 50s film noir. \"It's almost a given that my heroes will be incompetent.\" </p> <p>At points, Lethem's conception of Lionel's syndrome is brilliantly vivid. \"Tourette's,\" Lionel declares, \"is just one big lifetime of tag, really. The world (or my brain - same thing) appoints me it , again and again. So I tag back. Can it do otherwise?\" Elsewhere, the condition lends itself a little too easily to Lethem's genre gameplay and literary pyrotechnics, and you start to wonder how realistic this is. </p> <p>Lethem concedes that \"Lionel's vast proliferation of utterances and the number of different kinds of Tourettic symptoms he displays all at once are probably pretty unlikely. But there's nothing impossible about him; he's just a hypertrophied, literarily decorated version.\" The most remarkable feature of his spin on the condition is how Lionel's ultimate tic is to \"relate everything to my Tourette's\". The recreation of the world in Tourettic terms is a considerable imaginative feat, which Lethem admits is \"my own invention. I have a weakness for meta-fiction, for sentences that think about themselves and characters on whom it dawns that they might be characters.

How times have changed. Now men want to be more like women, sometimes even to be women. Failing that, the question today seems to be: \"Can a man think, feel and therefore write like (or possibly as) a woman?\" </p> <p>Last week, the poet Hugo Williams won the 1999 T.S. Eliot Award for his new collection, Billy's Rain. The book contains a poem called Rhetorical Questions in which the narrator, the \"I\" who dominates most of the poems, asks his lover (rhetorically) how she thinks he feels when she sets off \"alone/down the hall of collapsing columns\", a metaphor for orgasm. One (male) critic said Williams had written \"as fine a description of female orgasm as a man can\". Which begs the question: can a man really know how a woman feels and vice versa? And is it possible for a male writer to understand, really understand, what it's like to be a woman and vice versa? </p> <p>The subject of last week's In Our Times, the Radio 4 discussion programme presented by Melvyn Bragg, was masculinity in literature. In it, Martin Amis and Cora Kaplan, an American feminist critic who is also Professor of English at Southampton University, discussed the way men had been portrayed in fiction in the 20th century and how that portrayal had changed as a result of feminism. </p> <p>Amis' novel Night Train, published in 1997, was written in the voice of an American policewoman, Detective Mike Hoolihan. Note the masculinity of the name and note also the opening sentence of the book: \"I am a police.\" It continues: \"That may sound like an unusual statement - or an unusual construction. But it's a parlance we have. Among ourselves, we would never say I am a policeman or I am a policewoman or I am a police officer. We would just say I am a police.\" This, in turn, leads one to wonder to what degree political correctness has influenced matters - and to what extent Amis, who claimed a new, softer attitude towards women, was sending up political correctness. </p> <p>Often the reason writers want to experiment with not just another voice (from another social or economic group or nationality, as Kazuo Ishiguro did in The Remains Of The Day) but with another gender is to see whether they can bring it off. It is also to see whether it liberates them, frees them up to express feelings, thoughts and opinions that might sit oddly in their \"normal\" voice. </p> <p>Sometimes writers like to tease the reader by refusing to reveal the sex of the narrator, as in Rose Tremain's The Towers Of Trebizond, Virginia Woolf's Orlando or Jeanette Winterson's Written On The Body. Winterson said of the mystery she had created: \"It is not important, it doesn't matter to me which it is - my own feeling is that it is both throughout the book and that it changes, that it is sometimes female, sometimes male, and that is perfectly all right.\" </p> <p>If the narrator is not apparently driven by issues of masculinity or femininity (ie sex), is he, she or it not free to concentrate on higher things? This is all very well in theory. In practice, when you have a gender-free narrator, the reader keeps looking for clues and that can be distracting. </p> <p>I am not suggesting that such political correctness should prevail in creative writing where only gay men are permitted to write gay novels, only lesbians lesbian novels, etc. This limits the imagination. If this perspective ruled, there would have been no science fiction, no crime stories, no Book of Revelations. If writers had been permitted to write just from their own experience, the canon of literature would consist only of a kind of dreary social realism. </p> <p>There is a difference, however, between, say, Tolstoy creating a wonderful fictional female character like Anna Karenina and a male writer trying to write as a woman. Like the outcome of a sex-change operation, it is rarely totally convincing. </p> <p>When the French sado-masochistic novel The Story Of O was first published, it was attributed to Pauline R\u00e9age. For a long time, however, it was believed to have been written by a man (because, I imagine, it was thought to have been too sexy for a woman). Years after its publication, and after her death, it was revealed to have been the work of Dominique Aury. She had written the book in an attempt (successful, it turned out) to re-kindle the interest of her lover, Jean Paulhan. </p> <p>Victorian pornographic novels were often written as if by a young girl, presumably in order to reassure the (male) reader that the girls were ready and willing. The girls always gave their repeated spankings and gamuchings (a Victorian term for cunnilingus) a terrific write-up. </p> <p>A good writer almost always has the potential to be interesting, whatever voice he or she chooses to adopt. (Incidentally, Martin Amis described a discussion with Will Self on the use of pronouns: instead of always using the pronoun \"he\", Amis said he opted for \"they\"; Self said he made a point of often using \"she\", a gesture of what he described as \"war reparations\". Adam Phillips apparently does the same.) Some experiences are universal: death, loss, exile, bereavement, fatigue, itching, hunger, headaches. Headaches may (famously) have feminine causes, but a headache does not differentiate between men and women. </p> <p>The reader should not be fooled, however, into believing that a man can know what the pain of childbirth (or indeed menstrual cramps) feels like just because he has read or heard or thought about it. By the same token, a man can't know, or describe, what a female orgasm feels like. Nor can a woman know what a male orgasm feels like, or how mind-numbingly boring it is to shave every day. Orgasms are a bit like that remark about the piece of string (as in \"how long is\"). Each is different. </p> <p>Tiresias, a Theban seer who lived for seven generations, had the unusual experience of living first as a man, then as a woman, then again as a man. When Zeus and Hera were arguing about whether a man or a woman enjoyed sex more, Tiresias was called in to arbitrate. His opinion, having seen it from both sides, was that sex was nine times as pleasurable for a woman. </p> <p>Now, his would have been a view worth having. </p> <p>\u0095 Lucretia Stewart's novel Making Love: A Romance is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.</p>",

The reader should not be fooled, however, into believing that a man can know what the pain of childbirth (or indeed menstrual cramps) feels like just because he has read or heard or thought about it. By the same token, a man can't know, or describe, what a female orgasm feels like. Nor can a woman know what a male orgasm feels like, or how mind-numbingly boring it is to shave every day. Orgasms are a bit like that remark about the piece of string (as in \"how long is\"). Each is different. Tiresias, a Theban seer who lived for seven generations, had the unusual experience of living first as a man, then as a woman, then again as a man. When Zeus and Hera were arguing about whether a man or a woman enjoyed sex more, Tiresias was called in to arbitrate. His opinion, having seen it from both sides, was that sex was nine times as pleasurable for a woman. Now, his would have been a view worth having. \u0095 Lucretia Stewart's novel Making Love: A Romance is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.",

We've asked British lawyers to do all they can and tomorrow it's ready to go to the high court if necessary,\" the source told Reuters.</p> <p>Belgium is one of four countries that issued warrants against the general. The others are Spain, France and Switzerland.</p> <p>The representation from the Belgian government follows Jack Straw's announcement two weeks ago that he was \"minded\" to halt extradition proceedings against Gen Pinochet on humanitarian grounds following a medical examination earlier this month.</p> <p>The home office last night confirmed that it had received an approach via the Belgian government's solicitors and that it was being considered. A spokeswoman added that a final decision on whether to allow Gen Pinochet to leave Britain would not be made before Thursday.</p> <p>Mr Straw gave interested parties a week to make representations, and last week requested clarification of some of these from Amnesty International, the Spanish government and Gen Pinochet's lawyers. The deadline for those to be received is 5pm this afternoon.</p> <p>Sources close to the general have ruled out the possibility that he would undergo further medical tests at the behest of any of the countries seeking his extradition.</p> <p>\"The general does not accept the jurisdiction of Spain or any other country in this matter,\" the source said.</p> <p>Amnesty International and the representations of other human rights groups to the home secretary centred on the inadequacy of the tests.</p> <p>The groups claimed that the fact the general was not examined by an old-age psychiatrist specialising in the diagnosis of dementia invalidated the findings of the medical team. They also claimed it was impossible for them to make adequate submissions to the home secretary without seeing the medical evidence.</p> <p>However according to the home office Mr Straw cannot release medical records without Gen Pinochet's consent. The general has already indicated he will not grant it.</p> <p>Any legal challenge to Mr Straw's final decision seems unlikely to succeed as the home secretary has wide powers of discretion to release a fugitive on humanitarian grounds.</p> <p>A Chilean airforce jet ready to fly Pinochet to Santiago will remain in Bermuda until a decision is reached.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The long-running saga of former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet took a new twist last night when sources close to the Belgian foreign ministry indicated it would launch a legal challenge if Jack Straw, the home secretary, halts extradition proceedings against the general. A spokesman for the Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, said its government would be seeking a new medical investigation of the general's health on \"an objective and independently verifiable basis\". \"We are trying to defend our interests in the best way possible. We've asked British lawyers to do all they can and tomorrow it's ready to go to the high court if necessary,\" the source told Reuters. Belgium is one of four countries that issued warrants against the general. The others are Spain, France and Switzerland. The representation from the Belgian government follows Jack Straw's announcement two weeks ago that he was \"minded\" to halt extradition proceedings against Gen Pinochet on humanitarian grounds following a medical examination earlier this month. The home office last night confirmed that it had received an approach via the Belgian government's solicitors and that it was being considered. A spokeswoman added that a final decision on whether to allow Gen Pinochet to leave Britain would not be made before Thursday. Mr Straw gave interested parties a week to make representations, and last week requested clarification of some of these from Amnesty International, the Spanish government and Gen Pinochet's lawyers. The deadline for those to be received is 5pm this afternoon. Sources close to the general have ruled out the possibility that he would undergo further medical tests at the behest of any of the countries seeking his extradition. \"The general does not accept the jurisdiction of Spain or any other country in this matter,\" the source said. Amnesty International and the representations of other human rights groups to the home secretary centred on the inadequacy of the tests. The groups claimed that the fact the general was not examined by an old-age psychiatrist specialising in the diagnosis of dementia invalidated the findings of the medical team. They also claimed it was impossible for them to make adequate submissions to the home secretary without seeing the medical evidence. However according to the home office Mr Straw cannot release medical records without Gen Pinochet's consent. The general has already indicated he will not grant it. Any legal challenge to Mr Straw's final decision seems unlikely to succeed as the home secretary has wide powers of discretion to release a fugitive on humanitarian grounds. A Chilean airforce jet ready to fly Pinochet to Santiago will remain in Bermuda until a decision is reached.",

      "bodyText": "American Beauty (pictured) has swept the board at this year's Golden Globe awards. The film, a dark comedy about mid-life crisis and teenage angst in America's suburbia, directed by Britain's Sam Mendes, won awards for Best Drama, Director and Screenplay. The Golden Globes, staged by the 82 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, is regarded as a good indication of who will win Oscars in March. It was also a good night for Britain's other hopefuls. Janet McTeer won Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her performance as the hippy southern mother in Tumbleweeds, while Phil Collins won the Best Original Song for You'll be in My Heart (from Tarzan). The Golden Globe awards ceremony, which has been increasing in popularity and credibility over the last few years, was estimated to have been watched by 300m people worldwide. The full results are as follows: Best Picture, Drama: American Beauty. Best Actress, Drama: Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry. Best Actor, Drama: Denzel Washington in The Hurricane. Best Picture, Musical or Comedy: Toy Story 2. Best Actress, Musical or Comedy: Janet McTeer in Tumbleweeds. Best Actor, Musical or Comedy: Jim Carrey in Man on the Moon. Best Foreign Language Picture: All About My Mother. Best Supporting Actress, Drama, Musical or Comedy: Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted. Best Supporting Actor, Drama, Musical or Comedy: Tom Cruise in Magnolia. Best Director: Sam Mendes for American Beauty. Best Screenplay: Alan Ball for American Beauty. Best Original Score: Ennio Morricone for The Legend of 1900. Best Original Song: You'll be in My Heart from Tarzan by Phil Collins. Full-length Blackadder movie to be made Rowan Atkinson is to make a film version of Blackadder, with our hero playing a pop manager who misses out on signing the Beatles. There have been rumours of a feature-length version of the popular BBC series for a number of years now, intensified recently by the reunion of the characters in Back and Forth, the short film currently showing at the millennium dome in the Skyscape cinema. But the stumbling block for Atkinson and co-writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis has been the period in which to set the film. However, according to cast member Stephen Fry, the team have finally decided on the 60s. \"We have had great fun thinking what the next one ought to be. We've decided it should be set in the 60s, where Rowan would be a manager of a band that was on the night after the Beatles played at the Cavern Club - so he just misses [them]... and he's enraged with bitterness,\" he said. Atkinson will play the Svengali Brian Epstein-esque manager Edmund Blackadder, and as usual will be joined by Tony Robinson, this time as the band's bald drummer, Rick. The remainder of the band will be played by Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerney and Rik Mayall. Together they spend the 60s trying and failing to make it big by emulating the Beatles. It is not yet known when the film will go into production. Ministers prepare to woo Spielberg The government hopes to persuade Steven Spielberg to make Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in the UK, and are preparing a charm offensive to woo the director over here. Ministers will highlight the success of Aardman Animations, the company that make Wallace and Gromit, which signed a \u00a3150m deal with Spielberg's DreamWorks studio last year to produce five films. One option for the dome at the end of the year is to turn it into a studio: a plan backed by Ministers. They believe that the move would plug one of the main weaknesses of the British film industry - lack of studio space. Government support for the project will be a boost to the consortium headed by the Madame Tussaud's group, which is behind the plan to turn the dome into a state-of-the-art film and TV studio. In brief As well as cleaning up at the Golden Globes, American Beauty also did pretty well at the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards. It won Best Film, while Kevin Spacey walked away with the Best Actor award. Other winners include Haley Joel Osment for The Sixth Sense, and director Spike Jonze for Being John Malkovich. The awards themselves will be presented in late February. Casting couch \u0095 Nicole Kidman is to star in Ang Lee's next film, a world war two drama set in Berlin.

Subs: Winterburn, Wreh, Manninger, Malz, Luzhny. </p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> P Durkin (Dorset) </p> <p>Arsenal are up against it for this crunch match at Old Trafford, which is tonight entertaining the largest Premiership crowd ever - 58,293. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is without Tony Adams, Marc Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp who are injured, while Davor Suker is suspended and Nwankwo Kanu is on international duty with Nigeria in the African Nations Cup. If Wenger believes his team are stronger with \"their backs against the wall\" then tonight would be the night to prove it.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Arsenal kick off, after a delay caused by Mark Bosnich wearing the same colour shirt as the Arsenal team. They immediately play it back to David Seaman for the first clearance of the game.<br> <strong>2</strong> Arsenal put some early pressure on the United goal but the ball is cleared for Nicky Butt to race onto the clearance. Seaman beats him to it.<br> <strong>4</strong> Patrick Viera passes to Ray Parlour who attempts to forge a break down the right, but the ball goes for an Arsenal throw. Thierry Henry unable to find space on the edge of the United area. <br> <strong>7</strong> Both teams still looking to find their rhythm but Arsenal come close when Fredrik Ljungberg dispossess Gary Neville and crosses to Henry in the six-yard box. The Frenchman gets his header in and forces Bosnich to make a great save. <br> <strong>9</strong> Arsenal getting the better of the early play as Jaap Stam gives the ball away and allows the Gunners to attempt another break.<br> <strong>10</strong> Lee Dixon feeds Parlour on the right but his attempt to get behind the defence is too heavy-handed. <br> <strong>11 GOAL: Manchester United 0 - 1 Arsenal</strong> Arsenal take their chance when Stam is again caught in possession by Ljungberg on the edge of the penalty area. Ljungberg looks up and shoots through the legs of the advancing Bosnich into the bottom far corner for his fifth goal of the season.<br> <strong>15</strong> Arsenal win a corner. Emmanuel Petit takes it and the ball is immediately played back out. Back in again to Henry on the edge of the area but his first touch lets him down and United clear.<br> <strong>17</strong> Bosnich appears unable to get any length to his goal-kicks and Arsenal are immediately able to pick up where they left off.<br> <strong>19</strong> A long ball finds Ryan Giggs out the left; he cuts inside and fires towards David Beckham who is advancing towards the six-yard box. Seaman gathers.<br> <strong>20</strong> Beckham, in space on the right, finds Dwight Yorke on the edge of the penalty area; he swivels and cuts the ball square to Andy Cole, who plays it back for Roy Keane to fire in a shot from 25 yards - Seaman saves at the second attempt.<br> <strong>21</strong> Ljungberg comes close again when he turns Mickael Silvestre inside the United penalty area. His shot goes just wide of the right-hand upright.<br> <strong>22</strong> United beginning to wake up as they realise their holiday is well and truly over. Ryan Giggs, 20 yards out, gets his head to a long ball but he puts it wide of Seaman's goal.<br><strong>24</strong> Substitution: Nigel Winterburn on for Silvinho. <br><strong>26</strong> Arsenal almost get a second when Ljungberg finds space in the middle of the park and runs up with Henry in support; he loses possession and the ball comes to Henry who cuts in to shoot from the left corner of the area, but Stam deflects what looks to have a goal-bound effort.<br> <strong>27</strong> United's best chance so far when Cole races into the left of the Arsenal area and finds Yorke six yards out. Yorke skies his chance under pressure, while United appeal for a penalty after Giggs appeared to have been held back.<br> <strong>32</strong> Keane side-foots a shot from just outside the penalty area; goes nowhere but comes out to Beckham on the right. He plays it back in but the ball is lost in the goalmouth crowd and goes out for a corner. Beckham takes and plays it deep onto the head of Yorke just inside the area - a great effort down that fails to find the foot of the turning Cole and the ball is kept out by Gilles Grimandi with more than a hint of handball. <br> <strong>38</strong> A golden chance for Arsenal after some poor defensive work by United. Henry gets the better of Silvestre and charges up with only Bosnich to beat - somehow he doesn't.<br> <strong>41</strong> Booking: Grimandi for obstruction on Yorke.<br> <strong>42</strong> United win a corner; Beckham takes but the ball is put behind by Grimandi. Beckham takes again but an Arsenal head again gets there first and the ball is cleared. <br> <strong>44</strong> United win a free kick 35 yards out. Beckham has a crack but fails to find the target.<br> <strong>45</strong> Top chance for United after Beckham plays a long ball to Cole 30 yards out. Cole immediately finds Nicky Butt who runs at and through the defence and toe-pokes a shot for Seaman to make a superb diving save. The ball comes out to Giggs who rifles a shot into the side netting. Half-time. </p> <p><strong>46</strong> The second half starts with a good deal more urgency than the first as United search for an equaliser.<br> <strong>47</strong> Arsenal win a corner on the right. Petit takes and Bosnich apparently gets a hand to it; the ball lofts up and comes down for Denis Irwin who falls on top of Henry before recovering to make a goal-line clearance. Arsenal claim that the ball was over the line while United claim that it was Henry who handled to make the clearance. <br> <strong>51</strong> End-to-end long balls as both teams search for an opening.<br> <strong>52</strong> Nigel Winterburn intercepts Beckham on the break and the ball eventually finds Parlour out on the right. He cuts inside but is challenged on the edge of the United area.<br> <strong>54</strong> Petit wins the ball inside the United half and slides a pass behind Stam to Henry who is mustered well by Silvestre.<br> <strong>57</strong> Arsenal win a corner on the right. Petit takes but it is too deep and misses everyone.<br> <strong>59</strong> Giggs races away down the left, crosses from the corner flag but Seaman rises to make the catch.<br> <strong>60</strong> Beckham tries something similar down the right; he crosses from a deeper position but his effort is wasted when no United players get themselves into position in front off goal. Beckham has a good shout at everyone.<br> <strong>63</strong> Beckham and Stephen Hughes appear to be enjoying an on-off barney as Beckham races half way up the pitch to make a crunching tackle on Hughes.<br> <strong>65</strong> Arsenal's defence look up to the task of keeping United at bay - every time United get the ball the Arsenal back four drop back to smother any chance for Cole and Yorke to take advantage.<br> <strong>66</strong> Substitution: Teddy Sheringham on for Cole. Keane lucky to avoid a booking after he barges Ljungberg off the ball and then chests referee Paul Durkin as he whistles for the foul.<br> <strong>68</strong> United step up the pressure as first Keown blocks a shot from Butt and then Grimandi gets in the way of a vicious strike from Keane. <br> <strong>69</strong> Keane again at the centre of things as he finds Sheringham on the edge of the area; Sheringham works a one-two with Yorke but he plays the return too long and Seaman gathers.<br><strong>70</strong> Substitution: Stefan Malz on for Hughes. <br><strong>71</strong> Ljungberg comes close to getting a second. He picks up the ball on the left of the six-yard box but his shot is deflected over the bar under pressure from Silvestre.<br> <strong>72</strong> Man Utd appear to have been galvanised by the arrival of Sheringham while Arsenal are visibly tiring.<br><strong>73 GOAL: Manchester United 1 - 1 Arsenal</strong> Keane finds Giggs wide on the left; he puts in a fine cross that Seaman gets a hand to, but Beckham knocks the ball back to Sheringham in space on the edge of the six-yard box to side-foot the equaliser into an unguarded net. <br><strong>76</strong> A Keown error just inside the Arsenal half almost allows Butt to run clear but the defender recovers to make a vital interception while still on the ground.<br> <strong>81</strong> United win a corner on the left, Arsenal clear but give the ball away to Irwin as United push up in search of a winner. <br> <strong>83</strong> The game has died down as Arsenal try to stifle United's frenzied attacks by pushing up themselves.<br> <strong>86</strong> Arsenal's second wind continues as Ljungberg plays a one-two with Henry before the Frenchman slides the ball out Parlour on the right. Keane gets back to make a great covering tackle.<br> <strong>88</strong> Substitution: P Neville on for Irwin. A drop-ball is awarded; it falls in United's favour and the move results in a corner for United. Beckham takes and plays it back to P Neville who loops the ball to Stam on the edge of six-yard box; his header goes over.<br> <strong>90</strong> Four minutes of stoppage time. United again step up a gear as Arsenal give the ball away with disturbing frequency. They will surely thank their defence if they secure a draw tonight. Scrappy stuff as Arsenal win the ball back. Henry wins a corner, Grimandi heads the ball across the face of goal. United clear. Full-time. It's a draw, and it's a fair result.<br></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/Match_Report/0,1527,-23904,00.html\">Sheringham the saviour</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,128669,00.html\">Perfect pitch helps champions hold ground</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Man Utd: Bosnich, G. Neville, Stam, Silvestre, Irwin, Beckham, Keane, Butt, Giggs, Cole, Yorke. Subs: Van Der Gouw, P. Neville, Berg, Solskjaer, Sheringham. Arsenal: Seaman, Dixon, Keown, Grimandi, Silvinho, Parlour, Vieira, Petit, Hughes, Ljungberg, Henry. Subs: Winterburn, Wreh, Manninger, Malz, Luzhny. Referee: P Durkin (Dorset) Arsenal are up against it for this crunch match at Old Trafford, which is tonight entertaining the largest Premiership crowd ever - 58,293. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is without Tony Adams, Marc Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp who are injured, while Davor Suker is suspended and Nwankwo Kanu is on international duty with Nigeria in the African Nations Cup. If Wenger believes his team are stronger with \"their backs against the wall\" then tonight would be the night to prove it. 1 Arsenal kick off, after a delay caused by Mark Bosnich wearing the same colour shirt as the Arsenal team. They immediately play it back to David Seaman for the first clearance of the game. 2 Arsenal put some early pressure on the United goal but the ball is cleared for Nicky Butt to race onto the clearance. Seaman beats him to it. 4 Patrick Viera passes to Ray Parlour who attempts to forge a break down the right, but the ball goes for an Arsenal throw. Thierry Henry unable to find space on the edge of the United area. 7 Both teams still looking to find their rhythm but Arsenal come close when Fredrik Ljungberg dispossess Gary Neville and crosses to Henry in the six-yard box. The Frenchman gets his header in and forces Bosnich to make a great save. 9 Arsenal getting the better of the early play as Jaap Stam gives the ball away and allows the Gunners to attempt another break. 10 Lee Dixon feeds Parlour on the right but his attempt to get behind the defence is too heavy-handed. 11 GOAL: Manchester United 0 - 1 Arsenal Arsenal take their chance when Stam is again caught in possession by Ljungberg on the edge of the penalty area. Ljungberg looks up and shoots through the legs of the advancing Bosnich into the bottom far corner for his fifth goal of the season. 15 Arsenal win a corner. Emmanuel Petit takes it and the ball is immediately played back out. Back in again to Henry on the edge of the area but his first touch lets him down and United clear. 17 Bosnich appears unable to get any length to his goal-kicks and Arsenal are immediately able to pick up where they left off. 19 A long ball finds Ryan Giggs out the left; he cuts inside and fires towards David Beckham who is advancing towards the six-yard box. Seaman gathers. 20 Beckham, in space on the right, finds Dwight Yorke on the edge of the penalty area; he swivels and cuts the ball square to Andy Cole, who plays it back for Roy Keane to fire in a shot from 25 yards - Seaman saves at the second attempt. 21 Ljungberg comes close again when he turns Mickael Silvestre inside the United penalty area. His shot goes just wide of the right-hand upright. 22 United beginning to wake up as they realise their holiday is well and truly over. Ryan Giggs, 20 yards out, gets his head to a long ball but he puts it wide of Seaman's goal. 24 Substitution: Nigel Winterburn on for Silvinho. 26 Arsenal almost get a second when Ljungberg finds space in the middle of the park and runs up with Henry in support; he loses possession and the ball comes to Henry who cuts in to shoot from the left corner of the area, but Stam deflects what looks to have a goal-bound effort. 27 United's best chance so far when Cole races into the left of the Arsenal area and finds Yorke six yards out. Yorke skies his chance under pressure, while United appeal for a penalty after Giggs appeared to have been held back. 32 Keane side-foots a shot from just outside the penalty area; goes nowhere but comes out to Beckham on the right. He plays it back in but the ball is lost in the goalmouth crowd and goes out for a corner. Beckham takes and plays it deep onto the head of Yorke just inside the area - a great effort down that fails to find the foot of the turning Cole and the ball is kept out by Gilles Grimandi with more than a hint of handball. 38 A golden chance for Arsenal after some poor defensive work by United. Henry gets the better of Silvestre and charges up with only Bosnich to beat - somehow he doesn't. 41 Booking: Grimandi for obstruction on Yorke. 42 United win a corner; Beckham takes but the ball is put behind by Grimandi. Beckham takes again but an Arsenal head again gets there first and the ball is cleared. 44 United win a free kick 35 yards out. Beckham has a crack but fails to find the target. 45 Top chance for United after Beckham plays a long ball to Cole 30 yards out. Cole immediately finds Nicky Butt who runs at and through the defence and toe-pokes a shot for Seaman to make a superb diving save. The ball comes out to Giggs who rifles a shot into the side netting. Half-time. 46 The second half starts with a good deal more urgency than the first as United search for an equaliser. 47 Arsenal win a corner on the right. Petit takes and Bosnich apparently gets a hand to it; the ball lofts up and comes down for Denis Irwin who falls on top of Henry before recovering to make a goal-line clearance. Arsenal claim that the ball was over the line while United claim that it was Henry who handled to make the clearance. 51 End-to-end long balls as both teams search for an opening. 52 Nigel Winterburn intercepts Beckham on the break and the ball eventually finds Parlour out on the right. He cuts inside but is challenged on the edge of the United area. 54 Petit wins the ball inside the United half and slides a pass behind Stam to Henry who is mustered well by Silvestre. 57 Arsenal win a corner on the right. Petit takes but it is too deep and misses everyone. 59 Giggs races away down the left, crosses from the corner flag but Seaman rises to make the catch. 60 Beckham tries something similar down the right; he crosses from a deeper position but his effort is wasted when no United players get themselves into position in front off goal. Beckham has a good shout at everyone. 63 Beckham and Stephen Hughes appear to be enjoying an on-off barney as Beckham races half way up the pitch to make a crunching tackle on Hughes. 65 Arsenal's defence look up to the task of keeping United at bay - every time United get the ball the Arsenal back four drop back to smother any chance for Cole and Yorke to take advantage. 66 Substitution: Teddy Sheringham on for Cole. Keane lucky to avoid a booking after he barges Ljungberg off the ball and then chests referee Paul Durkin as he whistles for the foul. 68 United step up the pressure as first Keown blocks a shot from Butt and then Grimandi gets in the way of a vicious strike from Keane. 69 Keane again at the centre of things as he finds Sheringham on the edge of the area; Sheringham works a one-two with Yorke but he plays the return too long and Seaman gathers. 70 Substitution: Stefan Malz on for Hughes. 71 Ljungberg comes close to getting a second. He picks up the ball on the left of the six-yard box but his shot is deflected over the bar under pressure from Silvestre. 72 Man Utd appear to have been galvanised by the arrival of Sheringham while Arsenal are visibly tiring. 73 GOAL: Manchester United 1 - 1 Arsenal Keane finds Giggs wide on the left; he puts in a fine cross that Seaman gets a hand to, but Beckham knocks the ball back to Sheringham in space on the edge of the six-yard box to side-foot the equaliser into an unguarded net. 76 A Keown error just inside the Arsenal half almost allows Butt to run clear but the defender recovers to make a vital interception while still on the ground. 81 United win a corner on the left, Arsenal clear but give the ball away to Irwin as United push up in search of a winner. 83 The game has died down as Arsenal try to stifle United's frenzied attacks by pushing up themselves. 86 Arsenal's second wind continues as Ljungberg plays a one-two with Henry before the Frenchman slides the ball out Parlour on the right. Keane gets back to make a great covering tackle. 88 Substitution: P Neville on for Irwin. A drop-ball is awarded; it falls in United's favour and the move results in a corner for United. Beckham takes and plays it back to P Neville who loops the ball to Stam on the edge of six-yard box; his header goes over. 90 Four minutes of stoppage time. United again step up a gear as Arsenal give the ball away with disturbing frequency. They will surely thank their defence if they secure a draw tonight. Scrappy stuff as Arsenal win the ball back. Henry wins a corner, Grimandi heads the ball across the face of goal. United clear. Full-time. It's a draw, and it's a fair result.

But their technique - injecting a cold virus modified to carry \"good\" genes directly into the bloodstream of a sufferer - was known to carry a risk of triggering an immune system reaction.</p> <p>Prof Nevin said that 11 gene therapy studies were under way in Britain using the cold virus, or adenovirus, but none involved injecting into the blood.</p> <p>Sufferers from inherited diseases fear that kneejerk public hostility to genetic medicine could rob them of a cure.</p> <p>Bill Gleeson, spokesman for Britain's 200,000 sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic defect which causes blindness, said: \"There's a difference between clamping down on someone who might be a bit of a rogue and stopping research altogether.

      "bodyText": "When Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old volunteer from Arizona, died during trials of an experimental gene-based medical treatment last September, his father called him a hero and praised the scientists treating him. But at the weekend, after US investigators probing an astonishing catalogue of safety violations and deception shut down all experiments at the once-esteemed Pennsylvania Institute for Gene Therapy, a shattered Paul Gelsinger was seeing his son in a new light: that of victim. \"Everybody was wrong,\" he said in a US interview. \"Even me.\" The Arizona teenager is the first person to die as a direct result of gene therapy, the medical revolution-in-waiting which promises to cure scores of incurable diseases but has yet to cure one. In the wake of his death increasingly troubling accounts began to emerge of the institute's cavalier practices. But the radical move on Friday by the US food and drug administration to suspend indefinitely all seven gene therapy studies at the institute, one of the world's biggest, still shocked the international genetic research community. In Britain, Norman Nevin, chairman of the government's gene therapy advisory committee (GTAC), said that there were no plans to re-examine the 40-odd gene therapy trials under way here in the light of the FDA's move. About 350 patients are involved in the trials. The GTAC, which licenses all gene therapy experiments in the UK, had already reviewed its programme after Gelsinger's death, Professor Nevin said. None of the British trials was directly comparable to what was going on in Pennsylvania. Risk \"I'm very happy that no patient in the UK is at risk as a result of what happened to Jesse,\" said Prof Nevin. Jesse Gelsinger suffered from an inherited liver complaint called ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC). The institute was testing a method of helping sufferers by using a modified cold virus to carry the gene which produced the deficient enzyme into their liver. After he was injected with the virus, Gelsinger's immune system launched a massive counter-attack to reject it which destroyed his liver and spleen and badly damaged other organs, killing him four days later. The institute is accused of giving Gelsinger too high a dose of the virus, ignoring clinical signs that Gelsinger was not fit to take part in the test and concealing from the authorities that previous volunteers had shown toxic reactions to the virus. Investigators could find no evidence that all the 18 patients recruited for the trial had been fully informed of the risks beforehand. Consent forms were doctored without the authorities' permission to omit the fact that monkeys who took part in a similar trial had died. Instead of screening the 18 for eligibility before they were recruited, the institute printed up eligibility forms only after Gelsinger died, leaving them unsigned and undated. The institute, which has an annual budget of $25m, is headed by the distinguished James Wilson, past president of the American Society for Gene Therapy. Dr Wilson has yet to respond publicly to the FDA's latest move. As founder of the biotech firm Genovo, he stood to benefit financially from a successful outcome of the trial which led to Gelsinger's death. Genetic researchers and biotech lobbyists were trying to distance themselves at the weekend from what happened at Pennsylvania, arguing that it was down to bad administrative practice rather than bad science and that a crackdown by the regulators would ultimately be good for the field's image. \"I think the public will have more confidence if they know the FDA will enforce the rules,\" said Michael Werner of BIO, the Biotechnology Industry Organisation. The crisis at Pennsylvania comes as biotech shares are surging on world stock markets. Wake-up call \"This is really a wake-up call, where perhaps we get a little comfortable with things as they're going on and then get a little cavalier,\" said Estuardo Aguilar-Cordova, a gene therapy adviser to the US national institutes of health. The first gene therapy trials were in 1990. Hundreds are now under way around the world, none yet offering a definitive cure but all sustained by the enthusiasm of drugs companies, the desperate eagerness of sufferers from inherited illnesses and the conviction of scientists that breakthroughs are near. Gene therapy covers a multitude of treatments, all involving somehow getting artificially manipulated genes into the human body to alter the way it works. This can mean changing the genes of a virus to kill cancer cells, using a gene to trigger an otherwise inert drug, or - the greatest challenge - replacing genes which do not work properly. It was this last method that the Pennsylvania team was trying to use. But their technique - injecting a cold virus modified to carry \"good\" genes directly into the bloodstream of a sufferer - was known to carry a risk of triggering an immune system reaction. Prof Nevin said that 11 gene therapy studies were under way in Britain using the cold virus, or adenovirus, but none involved injecting into the blood. Sufferers from inherited diseases fear that kneejerk public hostility to genetic medicine could rob them of a cure. Bill Gleeson, spokesman for Britain's 200,000 sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic defect which causes blindness, said: \"There's a difference between clamping down on someone who might be a bit of a rogue and stopping research altogether. Early surgery costs lives. Early anaesthesia costs lives. You wouldn't want to turn the clock back on anaesthesia, would you?\"",

Since the final newsreel was shown in 1970, some of the footage has been reshown in television documentaries, commemorative videos, and movies, but thousands more hours of rushes and out-takes have lain relatively untouched in the company's archive. </p> <p>Rarely seen images include Queen Victoria at a garden party, the suffragette Emily Davison being fatally injured when she threw herself under the King's horse at the 1913 Derby, and Winston Churchill cracking jokes on the Empire State Building in the 1930s. </p> <p>Julian Aston, the managing director, said: \"Some of this stuff has never been opened since the day the editor put it in the can.\" </p> <p>The company was founded in Paris in 1896 by the visionary Charles Path\u00e9 and his brothers, who quickly realised the potential of 35mm film as a newsgathering medium.

      "bodyText": "From the Wright brothers' flying experiments to Mussolini's march on Rome, Path\u00e9 News documented many of the defining moments of the 20th century, yet barely a quarter of its footage made it to the screens. Now the newsreel company's 3,000-hour archive is being rescued from the obscurity of its Pinewood vaults to be put on the internet, in an ambitious project to make these images of history freely available. In Path\u00e9's 74-year film-making history, 50 million feet of 35mm film was canned and meticulously catalogued. Since the final newsreel was shown in 1970, some of the footage has been reshown in television documentaries, commemorative videos, and movies, but thousands more hours of rushes and out-takes have lain relatively untouched in the company's archive. Rarely seen images include Queen Victoria at a garden party, the suffragette Emily Davison being fatally injured when she threw herself under the King's horse at the 1913 Derby, and Winston Churchill cracking jokes on the Empire State Building in the 1930s. Julian Aston, the managing director, said: \"Some of this stuff has never been opened since the day the editor put it in the can.\" The company was founded in Paris in 1896 by the visionary Charles Path\u00e9 and his brothers, who quickly realised the potential of 35mm film as a newsgathering medium. A London office was opened in 1900. From 1910 until 1970, when Path\u00e9 gave up the fight against the might of television news, it produced twice-weekly bulletins which were shown in cinemas around the country and abroad. At the height of their popularity, particularly in the inter-war period, these newsreels drew huge crowds. They were the public's only visual source of information on world events. When the last one flickered from the cinema screens, British Path\u00e9, by now separate from its parent organisation in France, moved into the lucrative business of selling licences to film-makers and broadcasters.

The cash was said to be part of a \u00a328m payment made in 1992 by the French oil consortium Elf Aquitaine to the Kohl government for the giant east German Leuna refinery and a chain of petrol stations in the region in the same year. The allegations, the most serious yet in the Kohl scandal, were made by Germany's ARD television and the French France Deux channel after a joint investigation into the roles played by Mitterrand and Elf Aquitaine in the affair. German and French television quoted what they said was a high-ranking informant from Mr Mitterrand's immediate circle who denied that the \u00a310m payment to Mr Kohl's CDU was illicit. \"It was not a bribe: the money was for an election campaign. The payment was in the interests of the state - for Europe,\" the informant was quoted as saying. The cash handover was said to have been overseen by German intelligence officers and to have taken place at the Richmond hotel in Geneva. From there it was secretly transferred to banks in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the TV channels said. In France justice officials said that a French businessman, Pierre Gu\u00e9lfi, who handled the transfer of some \u00a310m to Germany in 1993, would be questioned about whether Mr Mitterrand ordered the payment to the CDU. They said Mr Gu\u00e9lfi was already under investigation about the transaction, which he has said was a \"commission\" paid in the Leuna deal. Although from different ends of the political spectrum, Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand enjoyed a long-standing and close personal friendship. Both leaders viewed the Franco-German axis as a cornerstone of European integration and as a foundation for the successful reunification of Germany.

Mr Iddes, who now lives in Mexico was quoted at the weekend as saying: \"I have never done anything I should not have done.\"",

Now that's a different story. </p> <p>The average advert on the net consists of a series of glaring, over-busy images, a flashing logo and - nine times out of 10 - a \"click here\" or \"press me\" button. That's because research carried out a year ago found that advertisers increased the chances of users accessing their sites by 50% if they specifically instructed them to. </p> <p>And this, it would appear, is as sophisticated as most net advertising is at the moment.

We are learning all the time about how to influence online customers, and ads are becoming more refined.\" </p> <p>Indeed, so new is it that traditional agency creatives are still not really getting involved. It is more often than not left to the technical IT person at a web development company to devise the adverts rather than a properly trained traditional agency creative, hence the, erm, lack of creativity. </p> <p>Frank Harrison, director of strategic resources at Zenith Media, says: \"Net advertising is like radio was 20 years ago. The sort of people who used to be given radio adverts to do were the most junior or the least talented. It's just not sexy, and creatively is still very limited. So people who are IT knowledgeable are the ones producing the ads.\" </p> <p>Advertising on the web so far has also just been about getting hits rather than looking pretty - but this is something that is likely to change as the medium matures. Last week, Revolution magazine reported on Sony's first ever web campaign for the launch of its digital camera, Mavica. \"Rather than follow the herd with a selection of static banners [the panels across the top of websites] it entered the arena by specially tailoring video banners for the internet,\" the magazine said. </p> <p>The adverts show people actually using the Mavica over the line - \"save your memories to floppy disc and upload them to the world\". The adverts appeared on sites for FHM and Maxim as dotmusic.com and Trinity Mirror's ic24 portal. Actually demonstrating the product? For the web, that's innovative. </p> <p>Simon King, business development manager of Pixel Park, a full-service new media agency specialis ing in online marketing, explains why this is still the exception rather than the norm: \"Net advertising does not have much thought about it, but it is about direct marketing and interaction. It's not about looking at an advert and thinking, 'That's really brilliant.' It's about eliciting a reaction, not looking nice.\" </p> <p>The opportunities to advertise on the web consist, mostly, of banners. Aside from these there are buttons, or smaller boxes, usually at the bottom right, that are rather more subtle sponsorship arrangements with the site owner. There are also \"landing pages\" or \"microsites\", very small sites dedicated to specific subjects, and even something called virtual marketing, which involves highly targeted emails that exploit people's contacts or distribution lists by a type of electronic chain letter. </p> <p>Given this complexity, it is perhaps not surprising that campaigns are also currently media-led, not creative-led, driven more by media buyers within agencies and web design companies, rather than creative teams, because they understand all the different opportunities. </p> <p>Rob Watts, media manager at Pixel Park, says: \"Unlike the traditional offline advertising route, where the creative arm of the agency will produce a full campaign to a client's brief and the media arm adapts to place it, here a campaign is media-led. I come up with a strategy then go to the creative team who will do the design.\" </p> <p>The creatives will be told, for instance, that they have to devise buttons or banners of a certain dimension and they will simply be asked to come up with the strapline, the corporate colours and the tone of voice. But creatives need not be too nervous. Some basic rules of advertising apply as much to the net as to traditional offline media. As with press adverts, there are three ways to grab the consumer's attention: first with the headline, second via a picture or graphic, and third by means of a familiar logo that the consumer knows and trusts. Once they are dragged in, they can then be targeted with longer copy and a fuller advertising message. </p> <p>Wisdom is also building regarding advertising creativity on the web. Doubleclick, a company that delivers banner ads to a network of internet sites, has even erected a list of creative dos and don'ts on its website. These involve top tips such as what colours to use (blue, green and yellow work best, apparently); how animation can increase response rates by 25%; how the \"click here\" button should be located on the right hand side rather than the left; and how using questions in the copy rather than state ments can increase the click-through rate by up to 16%. The ultimate block to creativity to date, however, has been the technology itself. Restrictions in bandwidth, for instance, have meant that media-rich sites, or sites that contain lots of complicated graphics and visuals - ie, stuff that excites the average agency creative - still take time to download. Given that most users find this frustrating, advertisers are stubbornly sticking to the simple \"click me\" approach. Harrison says: \"An increase in bandwidth will mean video capability, for example. The medium is in rapid transition and what works today won't necessarily work tomorrow. The timescale is extremely compressed. The whole infrastructure and hardware and software are changing all the time.\" </p> <p>Despite all this, some advertisers are achieving a degree of inventiveness in their net adverts. Comet recently mounted a campaign that consisted of more than 40 banners, instead of the usual four or five, each of which was specifically tailored to the separate host sites. </p> <p>IBM, too, last year ran one of the most successful banner campaigns so far, targeted at students who were leaving university. The company bought up a database enabling it to talk to users about the specific university they had been to: such highly personalised messages meant that 50% of those who saw the site clicked on it. </p> <p>Some banners are also dropping the click-through mechanism altogether and incorporating more information in themselves, so the user does not have to leave the host site and go meandering off into cyberspace. Interflora's banners, meanwhile, include a device for ordering and addressing flowers without users having to visit their site at all. </p> <p>Whether creativity improves or not, advertising on the internet is obviously here to stay. Recent studies have suggested that consumers are becoming increasingly punch-drunk by offline advertising and so compa nies are turning more to the web as a medium. Amazon.com also found at the end of last year that people admit they are highly influenced by online ads - more so, even, than traditional advertising. </p> <p>In the light of this almost guaranteed, even limitless, expansion of the net as a medium, it would be good to think the advertising will get a little prettier. It can't get much worse.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC yesterday admitted that a third of the participants in the Castaway 2000 series, who were supposed to be living rough on a remote Scottish island, had been staying in holiday cottages on the island of Harris. Illness and bad weather meant that 12 of the volunteers had been taken by helicopter from Taransay to Tarbert on neighbouring Harris, said the programme's makers. The \u00a32.4m Castaway 2000, the preliminary episodes of which have been a welcome ratings hit for BBC1, was supposed to document 36 people living together away from modern civilisation for a year on an inhospitable island. The first fortnight of what the BBC billed as a \"unique social experiment\" was dogged by problems as the castaways struggled to settle on the unforgiving island. Some volunteers were taken off earlier this month with flu; the others left after gale force winds ripped roofs from their huts. The series was intended to be about how the 28 adults and eight children organised themselves as a community and dealt with problems, said its executive producer, Jeremy Mills. The \"teething problems\" had not undermined the project because it was unfair to expect the modern day castaways to live in unfinished accommodation. \"It was just temporary until the builders finished. We had 20 people, including children, sleeping in one room, and many of them had flu. We couldn't risk it.\" Some of the 12 were still in the holiday flats, he said, but he promised that once the series got started properly nothing other than a medical emergency would allow the volunteers to leave Taransay. All the early misfortunes are being covered in the programme, which will continue on BBC1 on Tuesday and Wednesday. \"Two-thirds of the people are still there and have always been there. This is not a physical survival series; it is a sur vival series of the emotional and psychological aspects of leaving the world you know behind. \"The viewers have not been conned. The intention was to see if you could create a society for disparate people from different backgrounds. \"The very fact that things have been forced upon them by bad weather and illness is something we thought would always happen.\" A BBC spokeswoman said that \"in those circumstances it would have been irresponsible to keep people on the island\".",

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin said yesterday that rescue teams had found the body of a senior Russian general who disappeared in fighting in Grozny last week. Last week Russia admitted that one of its top military commanders, Major-General Mikhail Malofeyev, was missing after leading an attack on the rebels in the no man's zone in the Chechen capital. The rebels had claimed that Malofeyev had been captured and interrogated outside Grozny, and said they had video footage to prove it. But news agencies yesterday quoted a spokesman for the acting president and prime minister, Vladimir Putin, as saying the general's body had been found by rescue teams. The wife of the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, had earlier contradicted Russian reports that he had been wounded. Kusama Maskhadov said that she had spoken to him by phone and he was \"alive and well\". Despite severe winter weather, Russian forces continued to hammer Chechen rebel positions in mountain gorges and in the shattered capital but reported little headway in their gruelling week-long drive to storm the city. On Saturday pro-Moscow Chechen militiamen raised a Russian flag over a residential district on the edge of Grozny. But the city centre remains in guerrilla hands. The city's maze-like streets and Soviet-era nuclear bunkers make it a haven for urban guerrillas working in small groups of snipers, machinegunners and mortar grenadiers. Between 10,000 and 40,000 civilians remain, trapped in cellars. Malik Saidullayev, a pro-Moscow Chechen businessman, had been due to fly to Chechnya from Moscow last night to meet the leaders of armed groups and try to bring them onto Russia's side. But he postponed his visit till later this week. Rebels have dismissed his initiative. Far from adopting a conciliatory tone, they opened an embassy in Afghanistan yesterday. A green, white and black flag with six stars and a wolf was raised over a building in Kabul's city centre. The Taliban, ruling a country where thousands of Russian soldiers were killed by Islamist guerrillas during the Soviet army's 1979-89 intervention, is the first movement to have recognised a Chechen separatist government. The Taliban's deputy foreign minister, Abdul Rehman, praised Chechen separatists for putting up what he called stiff resistance to a vast Russian force which has been trying to crush their resistance in Grozny. He urged other Muslim states to rally behind the Chechen people. Reuters",

I'm not, myself, a great admirer of movies set in the future, but the special effects were above average and the science-fiction story more intelligent than usual.</p> <p>But I still can't work out why Cherie Booth QC and her colleagues should have named their new barristers' chambers after the film. Matrix Chambers will no doubt have chairs similar to the ones you had to sit on to be whisked into the cinematic Matrix; but surely the barristers will not need to be fitted with electrodes in order to be transported into court? Perhaps the link is symbolic. In the movie, the normal world was awful and derelict; only the Matrix was wonderful.</p> <p>But I approve of the trend of calling the new breed of dynamic, thrusting chambers after films, and I eagerly await Lethal Weapon 3 and The Terminator; or, more honestly, For a Few Dollars More, or Greed. (One barrister grumpily suggested to me that the Booth Bunch should have called themselves Mammon Chambers).</p> <p>Or have I got it wrong? Perhaps the reference is to the Matrix Churchill (Arms to Iraq) affair, in which case the new trend is towards naming chambers after scandals during Tory rule. Cash for Questions Chambers, anyone?</p> <p>It's only fair to say what matrix really means. The OED says it's a place or medium in which something is bred, produced or developed; a place or point of origin and growth - like the jam-jar in which I once grew an avocado.

      "bodyText": "It was, of its kind, an impressive film, with Keanu Reeves giving one of his better performances. I'm not, myself, a great admirer of movies set in the future, but the special effects were above average and the science-fiction story more intelligent than usual. But I still can't work out why Cherie Booth QC and her colleagues should have named their new barristers' chambers after the film. Matrix Chambers will no doubt have chairs similar to the ones you had to sit on to be whisked into the cinematic Matrix; but surely the barristers will not need to be fitted with electrodes in order to be transported into court? Perhaps the link is symbolic. In the movie, the normal world was awful and derelict; only the Matrix was wonderful. But I approve of the trend of calling the new breed of dynamic, thrusting chambers after films, and I eagerly await Lethal Weapon 3 and The Terminator; or, more honestly, For a Few Dollars More, or Greed. (One barrister grumpily suggested to me that the Booth Bunch should have called themselves Mammon Chambers). Or have I got it wrong? Perhaps the reference is to the Matrix Churchill (Arms to Iraq) affair, in which case the new trend is towards naming chambers after scandals during Tory rule. Cash for Questions Chambers, anyone? It's only fair to say what matrix really means. The OED says it's a place or medium in which something is bred, produced or developed; a place or point of origin and growth - like the jam-jar in which I once grew an avocado. Jam-jar Chambers hasn't quite got the same ring. So the Wakeham Commission has chickened out of proposing that the law lords should no longer be part of the legislature. One of the reasons given is really curious: that, by being part of the law-making chamber, senior judges could be made aware of the social developments and political balances that underlay most legislation.

In the latest case, she alleges she was unfairly rejected for promotion as one of the 42 chief crown prosecutors who head up the service's regional offices.</p> <p>The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) gave the CPS notice that it would launch a formal inquiry this month unless the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, and CPS chief executive Mark Addison showed sufficient determination to put things right. After accusations of foot-dragging, the CRE has now agreed to allow the service three months more to demonstrate its commitment to change. This week an independent investigator, Sylvia Denman, commissioned and paid for by the CPS, will start trying to pinpoint how its procedures and practices have failed black and Asian lawyers. The CRE, which has only suspended its threat of a formal inquiry, has demanded a preliminary report from her by the end of April.</p> <p>The CPS has a good record for employing a diverse workforce - in London 30 per cent of lawyers come from ethnic minorities - but the top ranks are largely white and male. A painstaking selection process for the 42 new chief crown prosecutors appointed last year laid much emphasis on equal opportunities, and included the black chairman of the Bar's race relations committee, Lincoln Crawford, on the interview panel. Yet all 42 who won through were white and only eight were women, though one black woman, Melanie Werrett, was chosen as one of three assistant chief crown prosecutors in London, the next level down.</p> <p>Few ethnic minority lawyers applied: few had progressed far enough in their careers to be in the running for the top jobs, it seems. Like Hackney - also the subject, in 1997, of an independent investigation - the CPS seems to have been satisfied that it was doing its bit for equality in recruitment, but failed to follow through with equal opportunities for promotion and career development.</p> <p>Mark Addison admits: \"Overall our representation isn't bad, in terms of the national benchmark, but it's very, very skewed. The further up the structure you go, the fewer ethnic minority staff we have. So if you look at the most senior managers, in particular at the chief crown prosecutors and the directors, it looks thin.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"If you asked a lot of our ethnic minority staff in the areas and in HQ whether they feel that they're fairly treated and whether they have confidence in the procedures that we have for looking at things like recruitment, appraisal and promotion, and for selection for special types of opportunities which might come up, I think we would find that they don't have confidence that those procedures are fair by any means. So we have a problem in terms of the way the staff think about the way we as a management treat them.\"</p> <p>The problem is one Addison and Calvert-Smith, who took over what was widely seen as a \"poisoned chalice\" in 1998, inherited from the previous administration. Apart from dissatisfaction with promotion prospects for ethnic minority lawyers, staff generally were beleaguered, swamped by a tide of bureaucracy and paperwork, and morale had plummeted.</p> <p>The new administration says it is determined to solve the race problem. Addison says the CRE thinks that \"although our hearts are in the right place, we haven't actually put enough oomph into tackling these issues and giving a big enough lead from the top that we mean business and we want to speed up the process of reform.\"</p> <p>Sir Herman Ouseley, chairman of the CRE, confirms: \"We reached the point in December where we were very frustrated by the lack of progress and the way we were being fobbed off. But by the early part of January we felt the CPS were demonstrating sufficient urgency and commitment to tackle the problems about which we were concerned.\"</p> <p>Barbados-born Denman, who qualified as a barrister, worked as an academic lawyer and now chairs Camden and Islington health authority, is a former member of the Race Relations Board (the CRE's predecessor). She faces a daunting task in producing an initial report in three months. \"In three months I can no more than get a sense of what the size of the problem is, before I can go forward to analyse properly and prescribe what the organisation should be doing.\"</p> <p>The job is a delicate one too: when independent investigators come into an organisation buffeted by tribunal claims, there is often a climate of fear in which staff are reluctant to be seen coming forward. Management at the CPS's Ludgate Hill headquarters were uncertain last week that they could find Denman a room there: she might have to be billeted at a satellite office at Victoria, they warned. But Denman made it clear she was determined to set herself up at Ludgate Hill, where most of the senior staff work and the bulk of the papers she will need to study are held. She plans to operate an open door policy, ready to see anyone who chooses to turn up, and will probably move later to another location more acceptable to staff who are reluctant to come to HQ. \"I don't want people who might feel vulnerable to think that they're being spied on.\"</p> <p>The first phase will be to get a feel of the organisation and find out what happened in the tribunal cases. She will go on to make findings about where the problems lie, draw up an action plan to implement change, and then she hopes to oversee the monitoring of the changes and suggest any necessary adjustments.</p> <p>Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, says ethnic minority staff still feel \"passed over, left out and marginalised\". He adds: \"It's an odd situation when the Met and most of the police are further forward than the CPS in terms of equality. Our view is they have to take a pounding before there's an improvement.\"</p>",

She faces a daunting task in producing an initial report in three months. \"In three months I can no more than get a sense of what the size of the problem is, before I can go forward to analyse properly and prescribe what the organisation should be doing.\" The job is a delicate one too: when independent investigators come into an organisation buffeted by tribunal claims, there is often a climate of fear in which staff are reluctant to be seen coming forward. Management at the CPS's Ludgate Hill headquarters were uncertain last week that they could find Denman a room there: she might have to be billeted at a satellite office at Victoria, they warned. But Denman made it clear she was determined to set herself up at Ludgate Hill, where most of the senior staff work and the bulk of the papers she will need to study are held. She plans to operate an open door policy, ready to see anyone who chooses to turn up, and will probably move later to another location more acceptable to staff who are reluctant to come to HQ. \"I don't want people who might feel vulnerable to think that they're being spied on.\" The first phase will be to get a feel of the organisation and find out what happened in the tribunal cases. She will go on to make findings about where the problems lie, draw up an action plan to implement change, and then she hopes to oversee the monitoring of the changes and suggest any necessary adjustments. Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, says ethnic minority staff still feel \"passed over, left out and marginalised\". He adds: \"It's an odd situation when the Met and most of the police are further forward than the CPS in terms of equality. Our view is they have to take a pounding before there's an improvement.\"",

      "bodyText": "The European Union ended an embarrassing row over foreign policy yesterday by effectively dropping an invitation to the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadafy, to visit Brussels. Romano Prodi, the European commission president, issued the invitation just before Christmas, but decided after talks on Friday that Col Gadafy was not yet ready to meet EU terms. Mr Prodi's invitation had raised hackles because he failed to consult member states, the EU's foreign policy supremo, Javier Solana, or Chris Patten, the commissioner in charge of external relations. A statement from Brussels said Libya had not accepted EU conditions for the visit: unequivocal commitments to human rights, democracy, free trade and support for the Middle East peace process. Diplomats said Libya had continued to demand that Israel and the Palestinian Authority be excluded from the 27-strong Barcelona grouping of the EU and Mediterranean littoral states. The EU decision is a blow to Col Gadafy's attempts to end his pariah status after finally handing over the Lockerbie bombing suspects and securing an end to UN sanctions. The commission said talks between Mr Prodi and Col Gadafy on Friday had \"made clear that the conditions are not there for a prompt and constructive visit\". Mr Prodi insisted he had the right to issue the invitation, but EU sources said the former Italian prime minister had not accepted that he no longer has the autonomy of a head of government. The episode caused embarrassment amid EU attempts to increase its clout in the Middle East, with high-profile diplomacy and signals that it will bankroll a final peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, meets EU foreign ministers in Brussels today as Mr Solana reports on his visit to the region. Last week the former Spanish foreign minister went to Egypt, Syria and Israel, where he told leaders the EU was concerned about delays in peacemaking. Diplomats said Mr Arafat would be asked to strengthen transparency and the rule of law in the spending of the Palestinian Authority. \"Arafat has already responded positively,\" said one official. \"But the message will be repeated. It is important to maintain the willingness of the donors to provide further assistance.\" The EU gave more than 600m euros (\u00a3367m) to help reconstruct the Palestinian infrastructure in 1994-98, making it the most generous international donor.",

The brain is cleared and whitewashed. But then come the nightmares. Who will empty the kitchen while it is transformed and where will the mountain of crockery/food/cutlery/dog's bed go? How will we eat/cook/live/not go raving mad? I wake up in a panic and rush out to buy a cooker. This is our priority. Once we have a cooker, the new life will have begun. But cookers have changed. Dual fuel is in vogue. This means gas hob and minuscule electric oven barely large enough to roast half a quail. You must lie on the floor to inspect your oven and grill. At last we find a gas cooker with double oven. Perfect. Just what we want. It is not in stock. Neither is my second choice. They may be available in six weeks. I stamp out of John Lewis in a temper and have a scream on the pavement. I have no cooker and a parking ticket. No roast dinners for weeks and I have automatically bought a chicken. I run round to Rosemary's house and put it in her oven. However will I manage if she moves? Will the new start ever begin?",

      "bodyText": "Party activists in Iowa will cast the first votes of the 2000 US presidential race tonight amid clear signs that the volatile battle for the Republican nomination is being pulled to the right over the contentious issue of abortion. Fears of a stronger-than-expected showing in tonight's Iowa caucuses by the staunch anti-abortion Republican candidates Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes forced the party frontrunner, George W Bush, to bolster his own anti-abortion stance at the weekend. But the renewed battle for conservative support for abortion could ultimately harm Mr Bush's chances in the fight with the pro-choice Democrats later this year. Mr Bush had been under mounting pressure from conservative Republicans to stiffen his stance on abortion as voting day neared in Iowa. This weekend he stated that the US supreme court had exceeded its constitutional authority by proclaiming a right to abortion in the 1973 Roe v Wade case, the anniversary of which yesterday was marked by anti-abortion protests in many US cities. By saying he believed that state legislatures should have the right to determine their own abortion laws, Mr Bush was hoping to solidify his support in Iowa, where a poll this week by the Des Moines Register showed that 40% of the state's Republican voters considered themselves born-again Christians. By emphasising the states' rights issue, Mr Bush was also looking ahead to the first post-New Hampshire primary in South Carolina, where the same issue is at boiling point over the display of the pro-slavery southern Confederacy flag. The millionaire publisher Mr Forbes has spent more than $3m this year in Iowa in an effort to establish himself as the leading conservative alternative to Mr Bush. He describes Mr Bush as a \"Johnny-come-lately to the pro-life cause\" and has recently lambasted him in campaign advertisements as \"a pro-life pacifist\". Unlike Mr Bush, Mr Forbes pledges to have an anti-abortion vice-presidential running mate, and to make overturning Roe v Wade a litmus test for any appointments to the supreme court that he might make as president. Mr Bauer and Mr Keyes in turn regard Mr Forbes as less than a whole-hearted believer in the anti-abortion cause, and they are both fighting hard to capture the conservative vote in a state with powerful religious networks. Mr Bauer mounted the most dramatic anti-abortion campaign event of a highly charged weekend by visiting the grave of a foetus in a Des Moines cemetery to commemorate the Roe v Wade decision. \"We have taken a whole class of Americans - our unborn children - and said to them they have no rights,\" Mr Bauer said after laying two roses on the grave. \"We treat our own flesh and blood like styro-foam cups. If we can't get this issue right, we're not going to get any of them right.\" No one, including his opponents, expects Mr Bush to do anything except win tonight's Republican caucuses in the predominantly conservative plains state. But in a contest where the media's portrayal of the candidates' showings is at least as important as the actual result, the Bush campaign is now trying to dampen earlier expectations of a record win. Mr Bush's conservative opponents have gambled most of their time and money on a strong showing in tonight's Iowa contest, hoping for a boost which will carry through to the February 1 primary in New Hampshire. The most recent Iowa polls have suggested Mr Forbes, in particular, is building a late surge of support, which threatens to keep Mr Bush's vote tonight under 50%. Any lesser showing would risk being seen as a defeat in the all-important expectations game. The danger from Mr Bush's perspective is that he could become the victim of a pincer movement by his opponents, with the conservatives wounding him in Iowa, and Senator John McCain, who is not competing in Iowa, then defeating him from the left in New Hampshire. Current polls put Mr McCain six points ahead of Mr Bush in the New Hampshire contest. The wider problem for the Republican favourite is that too many concessions to the right in the race for the party nomination may come back to plague him in the presidential contest itself. A new Gallup poll shows that abortion ranks 19th out of 25 issues in importance to US voters and is seen as \"extremely important\" by only one in five Americans. How the caucus works The caucus is a form of decision making that was once commonplace in US politics but which has now been largely replaced by the system of primaries, such as that which begins in New Hampshire next week. In contrast to the primaries - in which registered supporters vote in secret in polling booths - the caucuses are the domain of party activists and well-organised (for which, read well-financed) candidates. In Iowa tonight each of the 2,100 state precincts (roughly equivalent to a British electoral ward) will hold party meetings. Recent experience suggests that approximately 10% of Iowa's 1.8m, overwhelmingly white, registered voters will answer the call and brave the winter weather to turn out tonight. Since there is a contest in both the Democratic and Republican parties this year, candidate turnout is likely to be split fairly evenly between the two parallel state elections. Voting at the caucus meetings is normally effected by a show of hands, which are then totalled up state-wide. On the Republican side, the result is a straight count of heads for each candidate. The Democrats, by contrast, require each caucus to divide up the votes among candidates with at least 15% support at each meeting.",

      "bodyText": "A care worker charged with raping a woman with a mental age of two years and eight months has walked free without standing trial, angering professionals working with people with severe learning disabilities who fear the law leaves such people with too little protection. The crown prosecution service may ask the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, to refer the case to the appeal court for a ruling on the law, though that would not affect the outcome of the case. David Jenkins, a former support worker at a project providing supported housing for about 100 adults with learning disabilities in Ealing, west London, admitted a sexual relationship with the woman after she was found to be pregnant and DNA testing was carried out. The CPS decided to charge Jenkins, aged 61, with rape, rather than the possible alternative charge of \"sexual intercourse with a woman who is defective\" under the 1956 sexual offences act, which carries a maximum sentence of two years. When the case opened two weeks ago at the Old Bailey, Glynis Murphy, professor of clinical psychology of learning disability at the University of Kent, gave evidence during legal argument in the jury's absence that in order to consent to sex a woman must be able to understand \"what is proposed and its implications and must be able to exercise choice\".

The party general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, is among those making the case for change as the party embarks on candidate selections for the next election. MPs and the Fawcett Society, a women's lobby, warn that, particularly in Scotland and Wales, where MPs have moved to the devolved parliament or assembly, few vacancies in what are safe Labour seats are expected to go to women. So far four of Labour's 101 female MPs intend to step down at the election, and more are in vulnerable marginal seats. Women MPs are calling on the government to legislate to allow parties to present all-women shortlists for Westminster selections. Labour used such lists prior to 1997 until forced to stop when successfully challenged at a tribunal. Labour's first 1,000 days will today be marked with a robust defence of its women MPs. A Fabian pamphlet, written by Fiona Mactaggart, MP for Slough, fiercely rejects the \"Blair Babes\" media tag. Analysing weekly prime minister's questions, she concludes \"these women are not more sycophantic than men\", and finds that in parliament women are \"not silent\" but ask as many questions as their male counterparts. In answer to alleged failures of nerve, such as the 1997 benefit cut for lone parents, she argues \"women are less tempted than men to have a public profile offered by the opportunity to rebel without actually changing the policy, and are more likely to persist with the long, slow campaign\". This month Deborah Mattinson, of Opinion Leader Research, whose research work contributed to Labour's appeal to \"Worcester woman\" in 1997, reported that female floating voters were significantly less likely to be \"satisfied\" than men when asked how the government was doing. According to research for the Fawcett Society, women voters are keen to see more female MPs, but they suspect that the effort made by Labour to redress the balance prior to 1997 was a one-off, a \"plot\" aimed at winning their votes. Harriet Harman, the former social security secretary and minister for women, last week warned her party to seek out women's votes if it wanted to retain its majority. Women MPs calling for positive action, whether all-women shortlists or \"twinning\" of constituencies so as to ensure half of them choose women candidates, acknowledge that they are too late to alter the gender outcome of the next election. One party source said: \"We'll see how we go this time. \"But, if we do have some attrition in the numbers, that will help make the case for the future. \"The problem is that, though most minds have changed at the top, it's still difficult to persuade the local parties.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Archbishop of Canterbury last night intervened in the debate on the repeal of Section 28, raising the prospect of a new outcry over the legislation, which bans the promotion of homosexuality in schools and local authorities. George Carey said that he could not see homosexual relationships as an acceptable alternative to marriage, and called for safeguards to be put in place for schools and pupils. His comments came as the leader of Scotland's Roman Catholics, Cardinal Thomas Winning, denied that he had compared the homosexual lobby with the Nazi forces during the war; and as a Catholic priest went public about a secret support network for homosexual priests in Scotland. Repeal of Section 28 is a Labour manifesto commitment from the 1997 election. For England and Wales, the repeal had been progressing through the Westminster parliament almost unnoticed. But for Scotland, the Edinburgh parliament is holding a public consultation, which has caused great controversy. Dr Carey, speaking in London to church leaders of various denominations, said that the issue was a matter of concern to him. \"I condemn totally prejudice against anyone on the basis of sexual orientation,\" he said. \"But I also resist placing homosexual relationships on an equal footing with marriage as the proper context for sexual intimacy. \"With or without Section 28, we need to be sure that there are adequate safeguards in place for schools and pupils. I know that the education secretary, David Blunkett, is aware of such concerns, and has been considering them carefully.\" Tim Hopkins, of the Equality Network in Edinburgh, said that Dr Carey was entitled to his view, but he hoped that his intervention would not lead to the same kind of bitter debate that had gripped Scotland: \"It would be unfortunate if there was a similar huge explosion about this in England.\" Cardinal Winning yesterday expressed regret if any offence had been taken at his remarks, but denied that he had drawn an analogy between gay activists and Nazi forces. In a speech in Malta at the weekend, the cardinal was reported to have said: \"All over Europe an active and militant homosexual lobby is pushing for greater power and the threat to the Christian family is very real. \"I would ask you to cast your minds back to the dark days of the second world war... in place of the bombs of 50 years ago you find yourselves bombarded with images, values and ideas which are utterly alien.\" Yesterday he said his words had been misrepresented: \"The section of my speech dealing with homosexuality made no reference whatsoever to the war. \"The word 'Nazi' does not appear at any point in my address, and I believe it would be inappropriate, offensive and fatuous to compare the current debate to what happened in Germany in the war years.\" George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Kelvin, said the cardinal's words were \"so loaded and so pernicious\" as to further poison the debate, after the cardinal had used the word \"perverted\" in a previous comment. \"Cardinal Winning is not fit for the great office that he holds,\" said Mr Galloway. \"I think that his contribution to the debate has perhaps been the worst contribution of all.\" It was also reported yesterday that a network of gay priests has been set up in Scotland in the light of the cardinal's attacks.

It emerged yesterday that the fund has 75,000 shares in Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), Europe's largest research laboratory and a frequent target for animal rights protests after it was condemned by the home office in 1997 for cruelty to dogs. A Labour party spokeswoman admitted the fund had investments in the firm, but said the trustees were already involved in drawing up new \"socially responsible\" investment guidelines. However, in carrying out a review they are doing no more than obeying new government rules requiring trustees of all pension funds to examine the option of restricting investments to socially responsible companies. Privately Labour sources acknowledged that the revelations were already provoking a reaction from retired staff. \"Labour party pensioners won't like it,\" said one official. The source added: \"The pension fund is likely to be withdrawn from Huntingdon.\" The research centre, in Cambridgeshire, conducts experiments on live rats, mice, cats, dogs and baboons for companies testing products such as detergents and soaps, agrochemicals and industrial pesticides. A home office investigation into HLS in April 1997 found unsatisfactory conditions at the Cambridgeshire research centre and its licence was revoked for six months. News of the investments brought fierce protests from animal rights campaigners. The International Fund for Animal Welfare, which made a \u00a31m donation to Labour before the 1997 general election, said it was unlikely to make future contributions unless the shares are sold. An IFAW spokesperson said: \"We will be writing to the prime minister to ensure that this situation is changed as quickly as possible.

      "bodyText": "A mother who claims she became pregnant because her boyfriend used a faulty condom will break new legal ground today when she takes her \u00a3120,000 compensation claim against the manufacturers to the high court. Marion Richardson, 36, is claiming damages from LRC Products (formerly the London Rubber Company) for loss of earnings, the discomfort, pain and inconvenience of the pregnancy and birth, and the cost of bringing up her daughter Kara, who will be four next month. She and her boyfriend, Anthony Pugh, kept the sheath as possible future evidence after it broke unexpectedly while they were having sex in May 1995. It was later scientifically tested. The case is thought to be the first claim for the cost of bringing up a child born as a result of a defective contraceptive. Ms Richardson, who is on legal aid, is suing the condom's manufacturers under the consumer protection act 1987 for supplying a defective product. The little-used act introduced \"strict liability\" for faulty products, making it unnecessary to prove that the manufacturers were negligent. However, there has not yet been a case where a court has ruled in a claimant's favour against a manufacturer. The case is also the first of its kind to come to court since the House of Lords ruled last November that mothers who conceive as a result of a doctor's negligence - usually through a botched sterilisation or a failure to warn that a small number of vasectomies are not permanent - may no longer claim the cost of bringing up a healthy child. That ruling reversed a line of court judgments stretching back more than 10 years which led to six-figure settlements in scores of cases, including the cost of school fees for parents who were having their other children privately educated. Ms Richardson's lawyers are pinning their hopes on an indication by the law lords that the position might be different where claims were not based on negligence. Her solicitor, Carole Watts of the Norfolk law firm Cunningham John, said: \"In a clinical negligence case the courts decide that it is not possible to sue for the birth of a healthy child. \"But although Ms Richardson's daughter is perfectly healthy, this case is brought under product liability legislation and so the decision of the court may be different.\" The law lords ruled that mothers could still claim for the discomfort and expenses of the birth. But in the case of a Scottish couple who had a fifth child after the husband's vasectomy, they disallowed the bulk of the claim covering the cost of the child's upbringing. In papers filed with the high court, Ms Richardson says she already had two children, Nicolle, nine, and Courtney, six, and did not want any more. The writ says the pregnancy led to the breakdown of the couple's relationship and the shelving of a business project they planned together. Kara's birth by caesarean caused her \"considerable pain\", Ms Richardson adds, and she was forced to buy a larger car to accommodate an extra child. To succeed, Ms Richardson, of Carlton Colville, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, will have to satisfy the court not only that the condom was defective but that the pregnancy happened on the occasion it burst. The company may also decide to argue that she should have prevented the birth by taking the morning-after pill once she realised the condom had split. LRC Products states in literature supplied with condoms that they \"offer protection against unwanted pregnancy\" if used correctly. But the leaflet states: \"No method of contraception can provide 100% protection against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. \"Be careful. Condoms are very strong, but can be torn by sharp fingernails, rings or rough skin.\"",

The group's vice-chairman, Angus Parker, said: \"At last we have medical evidence that proves beyond all doubt that veterans are ill and that that illness is in some way linked to what they were injected with back then.\" He added: \"This is an unforgivable crime committed against the loyal soldiers of this country. The ministry of defence must be held accountable for this crime, which I believe breaks national and international law.\" Squalene, which is derived from shark livers, has been identified in the past by sufferers as the cause of the mysterious ailment. Gulf war veterans have long accused British authorities of covering up the results of an alleged experiment on the chemical's effects. Thousands of veterans of the conflict have claimed to be suffering from memory loss, tiredness, rashes and constant pain. A spokesman from the ministry of defence last night said that no British soldiers had been injected with squalene during the Gulf conflict.",

      "body": "<p>There are two fashionable phrases which television executives use when planning the publicity for a new series: \"We've got to help viewers find it\" and \"We've got to get those fingers on the button.\" </p> <p>These sentiments apply in an unusually literal way to The Clitoris Uncovered, the opening episode of Private Parts (Thursday, 10pm, Channel 4) billed as a three-part series on human sexual organs. Part two tackles the penis, which, in what is presumably a hint to male viewers, comes second. Rumours that the third episode would touch on the bottom - guaranteeing outrage from tabloids and politicians - have proved false. The trilogy finishes with breasts.</p> <p>Just as teenagers have traditionally ranked sexual activity on numerical scales (from one for kissing to 10 for sex), so it is that the terrestrial television channels become filthier as the digits go up. BBC1 is the most prudish, while Channel 5 has introduced soft porn to mainstream broadcasting. The network with the number 4 has been increasingly explicit but still a little short of 5. But on Thursday, Channel 4 goes all the way to 5.</p> <p>The first two parts of Private Parts are the most sexually explicit films shown on a major channel. The speakers in the penis film are interviewed sitting naked astride a chair. This is very much on the basis that Arthur Negus, when talking about a vase, liked to be able to lift it up and show it to the viewers. In the clitoris documentary, the concealed location of the subject necessitates the kind of pictures - peeled-back lips and close-in cameras - generally restricted to the badlands of the Internet.</p> <p>The series presents itself as education and will certainly find its most devoted viewers among those in full-time schooling.

      "bodyText": "There are two fashionable phrases which television executives use when planning the publicity for a new series: \"We've got to help viewers find it\" and \"We've got to get those fingers on the button.\" These sentiments apply in an unusually literal way to The Clitoris Uncovered, the opening episode of Private Parts (Thursday, 10pm, Channel 4) billed as a three-part series on human sexual organs. Part two tackles the penis, which, in what is presumably a hint to male viewers, comes second. Rumours that the third episode would touch on the bottom - guaranteeing outrage from tabloids and politicians - have proved false. The trilogy finishes with breasts. Just as teenagers have traditionally ranked sexual activity on numerical scales (from one for kissing to 10 for sex), so it is that the terrestrial television channels become filthier as the digits go up. BBC1 is the most prudish, while Channel 5 has introduced soft porn to mainstream broadcasting. The network with the number 4 has been increasingly explicit but still a little short of 5. But on Thursday, Channel 4 goes all the way to 5. The first two parts of Private Parts are the most sexually explicit films shown on a major channel. The speakers in the penis film are interviewed sitting naked astride a chair. This is very much on the basis that Arthur Negus, when talking about a vase, liked to be able to lift it up and show it to the viewers. In the clitoris documentary, the concealed location of the subject necessitates the kind of pictures - peeled-back lips and close-in cameras - generally restricted to the badlands of the Internet. The series presents itself as education and will certainly find its most devoted viewers among those in full-time schooling. These will be the most freeze-framed scenes on television since the disputed goal in the 1966 World Cup Final. The first film ends with a statement about the importance of encouraging people to discuss sex, but the season is mainly concerned with encouraging potential Channel 4 advertisers to discuss money: another illustration of the assumption among the minority channels that sexual content is the most reliable Viagra for ratings. Framed by the now familiar device of facetious vox pop - market traders and old dears in a rest home being asked if they know their way around a vagina - The Clitoris Uncovered first offers biology: all embryos have a clitoris, which, in those which will develop as males, is swollen by hormones until it becomes the subject of the second episode of this series. Next comes history: the discovery of the female form's delicious little secret by dissection in the 16th century and its subsequent naming by scholars, initially as the amor veneris.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone has moved to cement his developing alliance with former transport minister Glenda Jackson by promising to appoint her his deputy, and as chairwoman of the Metropolitan Police authority and roving ambassador for the capital, if he is elected mayor of London. The unconditional triple offer is made in a letter today to all London constituency Labour parties, backed by a demand that Labour add Ms Jackson to the party's \"top-up\" list of candidates for the London assembly elections so she can be given the deputy's job. The Brent East MP's pledge - aimed, he says, at mobilising Labour and Londoners \"behind a united team\" - was described by Ms Jackson's spokesman yesterday as welcome and flattering. But the spokesman added that, while she would not rule out taking a mayoral job if she were defeated, she was \"not accepting any offers from either of the other candidates at this stage\". Mr Livingstone's promise, which follows a failed attempt by former health secretary Frank Dobson to woo Ms Jackson with a less exalted job offer earlier this month, comes at the start of what could prove to be the most important week of the mayoral contest. Ballot papers will be posted to all paid-up Labour party members in London mid-week, and all the available polling and balloting evidence suggests that the Labour hierarchy's recent onslaught on Mr Livingstone has done little to dent his commanding lead over Mr Dobson. However, individual members account for only one third of Labour's mayoral electoral college. In the affiliated organisations' section, three unions and one co-op organisation are not balloting and the MPs' and MEPs' section is expected to deliver an overwhelming majority for Mr Dobson. The overall result is therefore expected by all camps to be close and the second preferences cast by Ms Jackson's supporters could prove decisive. Ms Jackson is holding a separate ballot of Labour party members in her Hampstead and Highgate constituency to decide which way to cast her own second preference. The expectation is that the majority will opt for Mr Livingstone. How far that will influence other Jackson supporters remains to be seen. A member of her campaign team declared yesterday that Ms Jackson was \"now effectively the kingmaker\". In his letter to London Labour constituencies, Mr Livingstone said Ms Jackson had \"won both widespread affection and respect from Londoners who have been impressed by her honesty and forthrightness\". He also said that, if elected, he would ask Mr Dobson to join his cabinet to \"coordinate the fight against poverty in London,\" and offer Trevor Phillips, Mr Dobson's running-mate, the job of vice-chairman of the police authority. If Mr Livingstone were selected as Labour's candidate, he would ask Labour's vetting panel to \"respect my choice for deputy\" and put Ms Jackson first on Labour's top-up list of assembly candidates, moving Mr Phillips into second place. A spokesman for Mr Dobson said the former health secretary was not in the business of offering jobs to other candidates. But he added: \"Let's see what the situation is in May and whether other people show themselves to be team players.\" \u0095 Mr Livingstone yesterday accused the Dobson camp of a crude smear attempt over his earnings outside parliament, writes Kevin Maguire. Details of Mr Livingstone's financial affairs have been circulated by a prominent Dobson supporter. The former GLC leader was branded a \"hypocrite\" for channelling earnings on top of his \u00a347,000 MP's salary, mainly from journalism, into his Brighton-based company Localaction Ltd. The pro-Dobson figure claimed the manoeuvre meant 30% corporation tax was due instead of income tax at 40%, while the Brent East MP advocates a new 50% top rate for high earners. And the Livingstone critic said the company would escape higher businesses taxes in the capital proposed by the leftwinger. Mr Livingstone denied using the company to avoid personal tax and said his income from the firm was taxed at the normal rate.",

      "body": "<p>E W \"Jim\" Swanton, who has died aged 92, was one of the most capable and respected cricket writers of his time. He wielded most influence as cricket correspondent of the Daily Telegraph from 1946-75. He also edited and wrote books on the game and, for many years, broadcast about it. His was a traditionalist approach to cricket; his standards were high and he never hesitated to speak out against any abuse of its values.</p> <p>Educated at Cranleigh, he reported sport, including cricket, for the prewar Evening Standard and, from 1948-64, doubled rugby football with cricket for the Daily Telegraph. Increasingly, however, he became involved with cricket at many levels. Indeed, the small daughter of a friend once referred to him as \"sort of a cricket person\". It was a description he relished, and employed as the title of his first volume of autobiography.</p> <p>He joined the army in 1939, and was an acting major in the Bedfordshire Yeomanry when he was captured at Singapore, and became, for three years, a Japanese prisoner-of-war.</p> <p>Swanton had broadcast running commentary on cricket for the BBC as early as 1934, and, when he returned from war service, he took it up again. He was an outstanding summariser, coming on at lunchtime and close of play with a shrewd and well-balanced ad lib account and evaluation of the game. His deep, rather fruity voice and style conveyed authority.</p> <p>In all, he made 20 Test tours - to Australia, the West Indies, South Africa and New Zealand - and wrote books about several of them. He was also joint author (after its first edition) of the authoritative A History Of Cricket, and general editor of The World Of Cricket (later Barlays World Of Cricket).</p> <p>A founder member of the Cricket Writers' Club, he was its chairman for the first two years. As a speaker he was sometimes weighty, but invariably sound and considerate of his audience.</p> <p>Tall and powerfully built, he was also a useful batsman at club level, and in three prewar matches, for Middlesex against Oxford and Cambridge universities, he scored 67 runs at an average of 13.40. In 1935 he founded the wandering club known as the Arabs, and made several tours with them, to the West Indies, Malaya and the Far East.</p> <p>Fastidious about his clothing and his car, Swanton was essentially a serious man with little sense of humour. In his early professional days he was often autocratic, fussy and even pompous. Indeed, the name \"Jim\" was bestowed on him as a humorous reference to \"Gentleman Jim, the Journalist.\" To this, his own players proved an admirable corrective, pulling his leg until he came to accept it with a slightly wry smile. He was, at bottom, shy and most anxious to be liked.</p> <p>In May 1973, Swanton became editorial director of the Cricketer, the magazine which had been founded by Sir Pelham Warner in 1921. He modernised it without disturbing its traditions and, when he retired from the Daily Telegraph, the magazine provided him with a platform for his views and recollections. In retirement he also became a committee member of the MCC and of Kent county cricket club (of which he was president, 1980-81). In 1976, he was made president of the Cricket Society. He was awarded the CBE in 1994.</p> <p>Swanton ensured accuracy in his reports by engaging a series of assistants, and often, too, a scorer, so that when, like every cricket reporter, he was forced to turn his head away from the play, someone else took care that no event was missed.

      "bodyText": "E W \"Jim\" Swanton, who has died aged 92, was one of the most capable and respected cricket writers of his time. He wielded most influence as cricket correspondent of the Daily Telegraph from 1946-75. He also edited and wrote books on the game and, for many years, broadcast about it. His was a traditionalist approach to cricket; his standards were high and he never hesitated to speak out against any abuse of its values. Educated at Cranleigh, he reported sport, including cricket, for the prewar Evening Standard and, from 1948-64, doubled rugby football with cricket for the Daily Telegraph. Increasingly, however, he became involved with cricket at many levels. Indeed, the small daughter of a friend once referred to him as \"sort of a cricket person\". It was a description he relished, and employed as the title of his first volume of autobiography. He joined the army in 1939, and was an acting major in the Bedfordshire Yeomanry when he was captured at Singapore, and became, for three years, a Japanese prisoner-of-war. Swanton had broadcast running commentary on cricket for the BBC as early as 1934, and, when he returned from war service, he took it up again. He was an outstanding summariser, coming on at lunchtime and close of play with a shrewd and well-balanced ad lib account and evaluation of the game. His deep, rather fruity voice and style conveyed authority. In all, he made 20 Test tours - to Australia, the West Indies, South Africa and New Zealand - and wrote books about several of them. He was also joint author (after its first edition) of the authoritative A History Of Cricket, and general editor of The World Of Cricket (later Barlays World Of Cricket). A founder member of the Cricket Writers' Club, he was its chairman for the first two years. As a speaker he was sometimes weighty, but invariably sound and considerate of his audience. Tall and powerfully built, he was also a useful batsman at club level, and in three prewar matches, for Middlesex against Oxford and Cambridge universities, he scored 67 runs at an average of 13.40. In 1935 he founded the wandering club known as the Arabs, and made several tours with them, to the West Indies, Malaya and the Far East. Fastidious about his clothing and his car, Swanton was essentially a serious man with little sense of humour. In his early professional days he was often autocratic, fussy and even pompous. Indeed, the name \"Jim\" was bestowed on him as a humorous reference to \"Gentleman Jim, the Journalist.\" To this, his own players proved an admirable corrective, pulling his leg until he came to accept it with a slightly wry smile. He was, at bottom, shy and most anxious to be liked. In May 1973, Swanton became editorial director of the Cricketer, the magazine which had been founded by Sir Pelham Warner in 1921. He modernised it without disturbing its traditions and, when he retired from the Daily Telegraph, the magazine provided him with a platform for his views and recollections. In retirement he also became a committee member of the MCC and of Kent county cricket club (of which he was president, 1980-81). In 1976, he was made president of the Cricket Society. He was awarded the CBE in 1994. Swanton ensured accuracy in his reports by engaging a series of assistants, and often, too, a scorer, so that when, like every cricket reporter, he was forced to turn his head away from the play, someone else took care that no event was missed. Indeed, it is probable that he was the most thorough, reliable, and accurate cricket correspondent of his period. He was not an imaginative recorder of play in the manner of Neville Cardus, and he had no striking turn of phrase. But he was a sound, professional journalist who wrote lucidly and without affectation. His judgment and values were sound and he always maintained a historical and moral perspective. In the D'Oliveira affair, to the horror of some of his Daily Telegraph faithfuls, he eventually came down on the side of the angels, and firmly against the South African government. A bachelor until the age of 50, he married Ann Carbutt, the widow of an old friend, and they settled in Sandwich. There he could follow his other hobby, golf, which he played, significantly, hard, and to the letter of the law. He was as proud of his membership of the Royal and Ancient as of the MCC (of which he became a life vice-president). Swanton was loyal; he could be generous; and, beyond his autobiographical title, he was very much indeed a cricket person. John Arlott Stanley Reynolds writes: Jim Swanton continued his long and active life after the late, great John Arlott wrote the above obituary \"for the files\" in 1983.

Kin joked that they would put the money aside for their old age. With an average life span of 83 for women, and one of the globe's lowest birthrates, Japan has the fastest ageing population in the world. This has led many commentators to express concern about the implications for pension schemes and medical costs. But Kin-san and Gin-san, as they are affectionately known, have been the smiling faces of this rapidly greying society. Until recently they appeared remarkably healthy. For their 107th birthday they wielded pink shovels to take part in a tree-planting ceremony. Although Kin lived to see three different centuries, she reportedly had more ambitions. \"After living all those years, she just wanted to live a little bit longer and become the oldest person in Japan,\" her grandson Yukio Narita said. He said she died in her sleep. Kin is survived by 11 children, 11 grandchildren, seven great grandchildren and one great-great grandchild. The greatest sympathy, however, will go to her sister, who lived 20 minutes away. \"We never thought we would live this long,\" Kin said on her 100th birthday. \"We could survive because we were twins. We need each other more than anyone else in the world.\"",

Hundreds of documents relating to the party's membership and financial structure were seized. The raids come amid allegations of impropriety surrounding One Nation, and represent a serious blow to Ms Hanson's hopes of making a political comeback. Ms Hanson, the party's founder, lost her seat as a Queensland MP in the last federal election but had planned to stand for the senate. The party is riven with highly publicised splits, mass defections to rival parties and damaging court cases. But the raids late last week by the Queensland police fraud squad mark the most serious blow yet to the ailing party and an increasingly isolated Ms Hanson. Ms Hanson claimed the police raids were politically motivated and were the result of attempts by the media and the Queensland and federal governments to destabilise her party. \"It has been a witch hunt on One Nation, and they are determined to get rid of me and get rid of One Nation,\" she said. \"They need to denigrate us. They need to have a go at us.

The party is expected to appeal against the ruling. In another serious threat to One Nation's survival, the state electoral office of New South Wales is investigating whether the party is legally registered. There are also claims of a missing \u00a31m in membership fees and donations to the party, which is tightly controlled by Ms Hanson and her deputies, David Oldfield and David Ettridge. \"The members have wanted answers to this for a long time and somebody has to look at it,\" said Heather Hill, secretary of the breakaway City Country Alliance (CCA), which was formed by One Nation's five Queensland MPs, who quit the party last month.

No one volunteered.</p> <p>The city council warned that anyone who helped to toss a live goat would be subject to fines ranging from 250,000 pesetas to 2.5m pesetas (about \u00a3900-\u00a39,000).</p> <p>\"We're angry,\" said a mechanic from a nearby village who has attended the celebration for years. \"It's a tradition and the people are disgusted that the ecologists have put a stop to it.\"</p> <p>The town council's announcement that the goat would not be tossed this year did not stop several hundred people from gathering below the bell tower in the tiny square in front of the stone church. A band played and several dozen people danced, dressed in carnival masks and colourful costumes.</p> <p>As the afternoon wore on and it grew dark, people began chanting, \"Toss the goat! Toss the goat!\"</p> <p>Cheers broke out when several young men arrived with the goat, but one of them told the crowd the \"ecologists\" wanted them to kill the goat first.</p> <p>\"Do you want us to kill the goat?\" he shouted through a magaphone.</p> <p>\"No!\" the crowd roared.</p> <p>The town was fined about \u00a3100 by the regional government after the National Association of Animal Welfare and Protection filed a complaint.</p> <p>Protests in 1992 persuaded the local governor to ban the toss. Villagers used ropes to lower the goat that year, but a year later the ropes were abandoned and the tradition was resumed.</p> <p>The origins of the ritual are unclear but, according to one legend, a priest's goat - whose milk fed the poor - accidentally fell from the bell tower and was saved by villagers holding a blanket.</p> <p>The toss also serves as an initiation ceremony for young men and women who have just reached military enlistment age. Traditionally, they carry the goat to the tower and catch it in a tarpaulin below when it is thrown. Last year the goat survived unhurt. AP</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the annual tug of war between animal rights activists and the people of a small Spanish village, the goat won yesterday. For the first time in years, Manganeses de la Polvorosa, a village 155 miles north-west of Madrid, held its patron saint's celebration without throwing a live goat 50ft from the church bell tower. \"That's Spain today,\" a tipsy villager muttered disgustedly to his wife after men leading a goat on a rope said they would toss it from the tower only if the crowd accompanied them. No one volunteered. The city council warned that anyone who helped to toss a live goat would be subject to fines ranging from 250,000 pesetas to 2.5m pesetas (about \u00a3900-\u00a39,000). \"We're angry,\" said a mechanic from a nearby village who has attended the celebration for years. \"It's a tradition and the people are disgusted that the ecologists have put a stop to it.\" The town council's announcement that the goat would not be tossed this year did not stop several hundred people from gathering below the bell tower in the tiny square in front of the stone church. A band played and several dozen people danced, dressed in carnival masks and colourful costumes. As the afternoon wore on and it grew dark, people began chanting, \"Toss the goat! Toss the goat!\" Cheers broke out when several young men arrived with the goat, but one of them told the crowd the \"ecologists\" wanted them to kill the goat first. \"Do you want us to kill the goat?\" he shouted through a magaphone. \"No!\" the crowd roared. The town was fined about \u00a3100 by the regional government after the National Association of Animal Welfare and Protection filed a complaint. Protests in 1992 persuaded the local governor to ban the toss. Villagers used ropes to lower the goat that year, but a year later the ropes were abandoned and the tradition was resumed. The origins of the ritual are unclear but, according to one legend, a priest's goat - whose milk fed the poor - accidentally fell from the bell tower and was saved by villagers holding a blanket. The toss also serves as an initiation ceremony for young men and women who have just reached military enlistment age. Traditionally, they carry the goat to the tower and catch it in a tarpaulin below when it is thrown. Last year the goat survived unhurt. AP",

Each of the three sections will wield 33.3% of the college's final vote, meaning that the vote of each MP will carry 1,000 times more weight than those of an ordinary card carrying member. More ominously, MPs' votes will be recorded, so the whips will know what they did.</p> <p>As a result, a substantial, perhaps even a decisive number of party members will use their vote not to choose the right candidate but to poke a burnt stick in Tony Blair's eye for his blatant gerrymandering. Present signs are that Ken Livingstone will get a majority in the rank-and-file section, and that Dobbo, if he is to have any chance whatever, will have to rely on the deeply tainted votes of the MPs - a group who have, in any case, no business voting in the ballot at all, whether whipped or unwhipped.</p> <p>But if this is the outcome, it will be a cruel injustice to poor old Dobbo. True, he might have made a fuss rather earlier about the blatant dishonesty of his Downing Street backers. But he can't be blamed for what they did, and he has made it pretty clear that he didn't like it. The question should be which candidate would make the best mayor, not whose election would annoy the prime minister most. It is infantile to kick Dobbo just to hurt Blair.</p> <p>There is a further complication, however. Even if members set aside their annoyance with New Labour's dirty tricks, it has been plain from the start that the choice was going to be made on the basis of which of the three had the more appealing personality, rather than on any discernible matter of policy.</p> <p>On the whole, Londoners love cheeky-chappies, and Livingstone's reputation as a tweaker of the Thatcherite nose back in the 80s transformed him almost overnight from a loony-lefty into the ultimate cheeky-chappy. On that basis, Red Ken started as favourite and has remained so.</p> <p>But one significant policy difference has emerged between the candidates during the campaign - the complex, almost esoteric, question of how to finance the massive investment programme needed to keep London's Underground system running.</p> <p>So far, this too has tended to favour Red Ken, at least among Labour party members, since he has been able to portray the ballot as a sort of referendum between his method of funding the Tube by the sale of bonds, and Dobson's plan for a public-private partnership (PPP) in which the public sector runs the railway and the private sector does the construction and maintenance.</p> <p>For many \"old\" Labourites, Red Ken's version looks appealingly like a kind of socialism, while Dobbo's looks suspiciously like the thin end of a quasi-Thatcherite wedge.</p> <p>But the reality is that Red Ken's plan isn't socialism, and Dobbo's isn't Thatcherism, either.</p> <p>In essence, both are convoluted ways of getting round that fortress of financial orthodoxy, the treasury, whose idiotically rigid rules of accountancy continue to stand in the way of direct state funding for the Tube -or for any other state enterprise, come to that.</p> <p>These treasury rules insist that, in the best Thatcherite style, public borrowing is inflationary and therefore bad, while private borrowing for the same purpose is non-inflationary and therefore good.</p> <p>Though these rules have been slightly relaxed as a result of the EU's formula for calculating the deficits of member governments, they are still applied with baleful rigour by that paragon of presbyterian prudence, chancellor Gordon Brown.</p> <p>As an unrepentant old Labourite, I am in no doubt that state funding would be preferable to either Livingstone's or Dobson's schemes. But short of some inconceivable cabinet revolution, that option isn't on offer.</p> <p>So the question is, what is on offer? The answer is Dobbo's PPP - which isn't just his plan, but is also the government's. The stark reality is that Ken Livingstone, even as mayor, simply would not have the power to go for a bond issue. In other words, he is engaging in gesture politics, just as he always has. I'll settle for Dobbo.</p>",

Present signs are that Ken Livingstone will get a majority in the rank-and-file section, and that Dobbo, if he is to have any chance whatever, will have to rely on the deeply tainted votes of the MPs - a group who have, in any case, no business voting in the ballot at all, whether whipped or unwhipped. But if this is the outcome, it will be a cruel injustice to poor old Dobbo. True, he might have made a fuss rather earlier about the blatant dishonesty of his Downing Street backers. But he can't be blamed for what they did, and he has made it pretty clear that he didn't like it. The question should be which candidate would make the best mayor, not whose election would annoy the prime minister most. It is infantile to kick Dobbo just to hurt Blair. There is a further complication, however. Even if members set aside their annoyance with New Labour's dirty tricks, it has been plain from the start that the choice was going to be made on the basis of which of the three had the more appealing personality, rather than on any discernible matter of policy. On the whole, Londoners love cheeky-chappies, and Livingstone's reputation as a tweaker of the Thatcherite nose back in the 80s transformed him almost overnight from a loony-lefty into the ultimate cheeky-chappy. On that basis, Red Ken started as favourite and has remained so. But one significant policy difference has emerged between the candidates during the campaign - the complex, almost esoteric, question of how to finance the massive investment programme needed to keep London's Underground system running. So far, this too has tended to favour Red Ken, at least among Labour party members, since he has been able to portray the ballot as a sort of referendum between his method of funding the Tube by the sale of bonds, and Dobson's plan for a public-private partnership (PPP) in which the public sector runs the railway and the private sector does the construction and maintenance. For many \"old\" Labourites, Red Ken's version looks appealingly like a kind of socialism, while Dobbo's looks suspiciously like the thin end of a quasi-Thatcherite wedge. But the reality is that Red Ken's plan isn't socialism, and Dobbo's isn't Thatcherism, either. In essence, both are convoluted ways of getting round that fortress of financial orthodoxy, the treasury, whose idiotically rigid rules of accountancy continue to stand in the way of direct state funding for the Tube -or for any other state enterprise, come to that. These treasury rules insist that, in the best Thatcherite style, public borrowing is inflationary and therefore bad, while private borrowing for the same purpose is non-inflationary and therefore good. Though these rules have been slightly relaxed as a result of the EU's formula for calculating the deficits of member governments, they are still applied with baleful rigour by that paragon of presbyterian prudence, chancellor Gordon Brown. As an unrepentant old Labourite, I am in no doubt that state funding would be preferable to either Livingstone's or Dobson's schemes. But short of some inconceivable cabinet revolution, that option isn't on offer. So the question is, what is on offer? The answer is Dobbo's PPP - which isn't just his plan, but is also the government's. The stark reality is that Ken Livingstone, even as mayor, simply would not have the power to go for a bond issue. In other words, he is engaging in gesture politics, just as he always has. I'll settle for Dobbo.",

      "bodyText": "Sunday Times German telecoms group Mannesmann is planning to buy UK telecoms group Energis for \u00a312bn. The deal is possible if Mannesmann succeeds in fighting the hostile bid from Vodafone AirTouch. Chief executive Klaus Esser is believed to have made his interest known to Energis and its 46.6% shareholder National Grid. Mannesmann is also thought to have contacted AOL about a European link. Energis is third in the UK market after BT and Cable &amp; Wireless. William Hill , the second biggest bookmaker in Britain, is holding exploratory talks with investment bankers about spinning off its internet betting arm into a quoted company. The net business is generating\u00a31m a week, and if floated would have a high market rating. British Midland will finally gain rights this week to fly across the Atlantic, breaking the domination of transatlantic routes from Heathrow by four airlines. Founder and main shareholder Sir Michael Bishop is understood to have secured permission for four flights a day from Heathrow. Sunday Telegraph Leading retailer bank Lloyds TSB is to spin off insurance subsidiary Abbey Life for more than \u00a31bn. Analysts say the decision to sell the subsidiary, which has \u00a312bn under management and 1m customers, is part of chief executive Peter Ellwood's strategy to focus the group on its core businesses. Scottish &amp; Southern Energy, created from the consolidation of Southern Electric and Scottish Hydro, is seeking a merger with United Utilities, the multi-utility group. Analysts said the combined group would be valued at about \u00a38bn. Executives at Arcadia are preparing to sell up to a quarter of the retailer's shops in an attempt to reduce the \u00a3235m annual rent bill and avoid breaking banking agreements. Industry sources say as many as 500 of its 2,000 outlets, including Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins, could be closed in the face of falling sales, pressure on gross margins and a debt of \u00a3250m after the acquisition of Sears' chains last year. Mail on Sunday British Airways will disclose cost-cutting plans today which may force hundreds of travel agents out of business. It is abolishing commission payments for agents who sell its tickets in a move likely to be followed by other airlines. BA announced in December that it wanted to save \u00a3500m in the next financial year and generate more ticket sales via the net. Arriva , the transport group, is completing an agreed bid of more than \u00a360m for MTL , the debt-laden rail and bus group. MTL was put up for sale in December with debts of \u00a350m. Arriva's move could prompt rival offers from Stagecoach and managers in MTL's bus division. MTL is owned by the 2,500 staff involved in the 1992 buyout.

Buildings that delight. Buildings that are only just Architecture. Buildings that, for the most part, have never been touched by the hand, T-square or computer of the architect. </p> <p>I'm thinking of that lovely litany of small-scale structures that includes potting sheds, shacks, cabins and shelters, the sort of buildings that stand, often a little skewwhiff, in fields, on slipways and causeways, by the sides of half-forgotten roads and among tall lupins and rusty lawn-mowers in summer. </p> <p>Many of the best of these truly vernacular buildings are hideaways. There's the allotment shed (fashionable now that many families are learning to grow their own food as a reaction to the GM stuff beloved of supermarket billionaires) where men used to escape the family row, roll their own and tipple whisky from flasks hidden among the spiders' webs that laced the crude rafters. There's the bird-hide, where twitchers come weighed down with improbable camera equipment to spend days recording Britain's fast disappearing song-birds, come foul or fair weather. And, here's one, designed by an architect, that combines several enthusiasms, pastimes and delights under one animated roof. </p> <p>This little building (pictured below right) was shaped by Niall McLaughlin, an Irish architect born in Switzerland, raised in Dublin and based in London for the past 15 years. It combines a hide for the photography of insects - dragonflies in particular - a sauna and a pondside bedroom. The building is one of several being built in the rambling gardens of a house in Northamptonshire that stands on the site of what was once the US airforce base at Harrington. B24 bombers flew from here, many on secret missions, dropping spies working for the Resistance into France. After the second world war it became a missile base. The concrete silos are still here, waiting for a new use. McLaughlin's clients have been adding one folly-like building after the other in the shadow of their unpretentious house. The hide-sauna-bedroom is the latest. </p> <p>\"No, it's not a conventional brief,\" says McLaughlin, \"but a delightful one. Originally, the idea was to build an insect-hide for my client, Gina. She takes close-up photographs of natural life, but insects are her speciality. The hide sits by a pond that has become a breeding ground for dragonflies. A camera boom can be swung from the hide to get very close to the insects. Gina's husband, Jeff, agreed it was a great idea, provided he could have the sauna he's always wanted. So we added the sauna to the hide. Then their daughter wanted a little bedroom where she could come and sleep away from the house, by the pond and under the stars. So we added a bedroom.\" </p> <p>McLaughlin drew together the structure's three disparate elements under a sloping, winged roof. This gives the building the look of an insect crossed with an old aircraft, which his clients found compelling. \"We always like to have small-scale projects like this in our office,\" he says. \"They're our professional folly, if you like. Everyone in the office has one up their sleeves. My latest is a new bandstand for the De La Warr Pavilion [a 30s Modern Movement masterpiece by Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff] at Bexhill-on-Sea. They're fun to do and allow us to play with ideas that might seem too flippant for large-scale buildings.\" </p> <p>Is there a danger of over-designing such small, low-key structures? Aren't they best kept well away from the hands of self-conscious architects? \"I know what you mean,\" says McLaughlin. \"It's the lashed-together, slightly wobbly character of shacks and shelters that give them their appeal. And there is a difference between what I call a shack and a folly.\" </p> <p>In McLaughlin's view, a folly, or at least a folly as architects see it, is a highly self-conscious jewel or oddity. Its design is very often an extreme or pure form of much grander buildings released from the restraints of function. Think of the follies in the gardens of Stowe, or Vanbrugh's Tower of the Four Winds in the grounds of Castle Howard. A shack, on the other hand, serves a function, albeit a simple one, and delights us by its essentially ad-hoc character. Think of Captain Scott's cabin in the Antarctic or the shacks you see dotted and potted about the allotments. </p> <p>In recent years there have been several books, mostly published in the US, studying the shack or cabin and aimed at architects. The purpose of these is not essentially to encourage a rash of shack building (local authorities in Britain tend to despise genuine vernacular buildings - they're not posh enough - preferring hideous \"vernacular-style\" cottages, their details a pot-pourri of the most embarrassing moments in the catalogue of trashy English housing). No, it is more a way of getting architects, brought up in a highly eclectic, postmodern era to get back to basics - to clear designery clutter from their designing minds. It's the same quest, in fact, that architects have pursued at various times in post-Renaissance history, not least in the second half of the 18th century, when their holy grail was the \"primitive hut\", or the source of architecture. </p> <p>The Abb\u00e9 Laugier described the primitive hut in his hugely influential Essai sur l'Architecture (1753). It was a miniature Greek Doric temple built of logs lashed together with tendrils. This was a deeply Romantic understanding of how architecture came about - Romantic not only in its artistry, but also in the idea that even the greatest temple is, at root, no more and no less than an elaborate form of primitive shelter. </p> <p>Small wonder, then, that in an overhyped and highly spun era of bombastic new architecture, a growing number of architects, including McLaughlin and his colleagues, are looking longingly at the simplicity and innocence of the shack, cabin, shelter and hide. </p> <p>Even so, such small and innocent buildings need not be primitive in terms of form or materials.

      "body": "<p>Richard Johnson was earning serious money in Hollywood 35 years ago. \"It comes as a curious shock to me now to realise that I was making around \u00a31m a year in today's money. And I managed to spend it all having a hell of a good time,\" he says, a bright grin emerging from his grey beard and illuminating the hitherto rather tired and crumpled features of the ageing matinee idol. </p> <p>After flying in from a short winter break in Sweden, he has spent a long day grappling with Chekhov in the Royal Shakespeare Company's rehearsal room, next door to a drive-thru Burger King on south London's Clapham High Street. It's now early evening and we are across the road in a bar offering a vast range of Belgian brews. Johnson asks for red wine instead and carries it to a little cubicle where his actor's voice has no trouble competing with the background music. </p> <p>Yes, he's looking forward to going back to Stratford, where it all began for him. \"It's a bit like revisiting an old lover,\" he says. \"Back in 1957, I was in love both with Shakespeare and with the idea of a company of top actors bringing his works to life in a small town. When I arrived there, Charles Laughton was playing Lear and Paul Robeson was doing Othello. Soon I was Orlando to Peggy Ashcroft's Rosalind. It was a wonderful experience.\" </p> <p>Exactly 40 years ago, Johnson was one of the happy few selected by Peter Hall to be an associate artist when the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre became the RSC. He's been returning at roughly 10-year intervals ever since. \"It would have been nice to be able to afford to go back more often,\" he says, the grin playing around the beard again. \"Unfortunately, what my agent used to call the 'shit factor' comes into play - the better quality the work, the less the money.\" </p> <p>The RSC was still in its infancy when Johnson's name used to appear in the programme \"by permission of MGM\". He had been spotted as one of the \"roaring boys\" of British theatre, along with Richard Burton, Albert Finney, Peter O'Toole and Robert Stephens.

      "bodyText": "Richard Johnson was earning serious money in Hollywood 35 years ago. \"It comes as a curious shock to me now to realise that I was making around \u00a31m a year in today's money. And I managed to spend it all having a hell of a good time,\" he says, a bright grin emerging from his grey beard and illuminating the hitherto rather tired and crumpled features of the ageing matinee idol. After flying in from a short winter break in Sweden, he has spent a long day grappling with Chekhov in the Royal Shakespeare Company's rehearsal room, next door to a drive-thru Burger King on south London's Clapham High Street. It's now early evening and we are across the road in a bar offering a vast range of Belgian brews. Johnson asks for red wine instead and carries it to a little cubicle where his actor's voice has no trouble competing with the background music. Yes, he's looking forward to going back to Stratford, where it all began for him. \"It's a bit like revisiting an old lover,\" he says. \"Back in 1957, I was in love both with Shakespeare and with the idea of a company of top actors bringing his works to life in a small town. When I arrived there, Charles Laughton was playing Lear and Paul Robeson was doing Othello. Soon I was Orlando to Peggy Ashcroft's Rosalind. It was a wonderful experience.\" Exactly 40 years ago, Johnson was one of the happy few selected by Peter Hall to be an associate artist when the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre became the RSC. He's been returning at roughly 10-year intervals ever since. \"It would have been nice to be able to afford to go back more often,\" he says, the grin playing around the beard again. \"Unfortunately, what my agent used to call the 'shit factor' comes into play - the better quality the work, the less the money.\" The RSC was still in its infancy when Johnson's name used to appear in the programme \"by permission of MGM\". He had been spotted as one of the \"roaring boys\" of British theatre, along with Richard Burton, Albert Finney, Peter O'Toole and Robert Stephens. And, like them, he evidently felt impelled to live up to the tag. \"I knew it wasn't going to last for ever, but I also knew I had to enjoy it while the time was right.\" So there were the latest Aston Martins, the rented villa in St Tropez and the marriage to Kim Novak, closely followed by the expensive divorce. And there were the best hotel suites and the late-night parties with Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson. Not to mention Frank Sinatra, who called him Dicky Boy. \"The whole world stopped for Sinatra,\" he recalls. \"He had the most astounding personality and energy.\" But the West End stage beckoning with John Mortimer's The Wrong Side of the Park. \"My Hollywood agent said, 'What do you want to go back to London for?

In its final defence against the competing bids, NatWest is expected to release early profit figures for last year of about \u00a32.4bn, and to try to persuade shareholders that it can develop the business in the future better than either of the assailants, BoS and Royal Bank of Scotland. NatWest will argue that its new management team led by Sir David Rowland, who faces court action next month as a result of a case dating back to his former role at Lloyd's of London, can run the bank better and without incurring the risk it believes would be associated with a takeover. The clearing bank recently bolstered its management with the recruitment of Gordon Pell, a former executive of Lloyds TSB, who has begun to lobby shareholders even though he does not officially join until next month. The Scottish banks have until next Monday to raise their bids and, in a nail-biting fight to the finish, both are expected to find some extra firepower to increase the cash element of their offers. In what has become a bitter battle, Royal Bank has toned down a pollsters' questioning of private investors while BoS financial advisers have run into hot water with the takeover panel over claims of fund manager support.",

      "body": "<p>For the first months of your child's life you want to be at home without chucking your career out of the window. You are a parent working full-time but you need to pick up your children from school or nursery each day. You are bringing up children alone, and if one of them is sick and off school, you have no option but to skip work. </p> <p>These are the daily dilemmas facing the average working parent. But let's be honest. When we say parent, we really mean woman. For despite a raft of \"family friendly\" government policies, new technology and the emergence of a so-called softer management style, women are still bearing the brunt of childcare responsibility and are forced into making unhappy compromises between home, office and children. </p> <p>Traditionally, family pressures have often dictated the type of work women undertake. The secretarial sector has always attracted huge numbers of women, not least because its hours have been relatively child-friendly. But the dramatic change in the secretarial role, combined with a fitter and faster workplace, has conspired to make any job a juggling act of home and work pressures. </p> <p>It's not a joyful task. A survey by Lloyds/TSB revealed this month that in the last quarter of the 20th century, working mothers were the most dissatisfied group of people in society, thanks to the pressures of running a modern family. </p> <p>Wendy Neusone, 28, who has a two-year old son and works as a full-time secretary for the legal department of the Equal Opportunities Commission, knows those pressures too well. \"I set my standards quite high and I don't like to mention it if something goes wrong at home,\" she says. \"You do worry in case it's looked on badly. My husband is away on business a lot because he is a sales rep, and although he helps where he can, nine times out of ten the burden falls on me. It can be a struggle to balance it all.\" </p> <p>The government has changed the law to make it easier for women and especially lone parents to stay at work. The Working Family Tax Credit allows eligible parents to claim up to 70% of childcare costs. But with the average yearly cost for two children in full-time care around \u00a36,000, returning to work is still not economically feasible for many women earning middle or lower incomes. Campaigners argue that the only effective way to help working parents is to provide adequate childcare facilities, but currently only one in ten employers offer any kind of help, from creches to information service lines. </p> <p>So what if you could pick and choose your working hours? Neusone, for instance, works flexitime, which allows her to beat the rush-hour traffic and pick up her son before 6pm, when his nursery shuts. Flexibility is the latest buzzword and new patterns are attracting working parents, since flexitime allows employees to choose within set limits the times they start and finish work. Part-time employment, job-sharing and working from home are now protected by law and are attracting both men and women. </p> <p>But many employers resist the idea of a more fluid and flexible workforce, and workers in support roles are by definition often less free to design their own working schedules. They often need to shadow the hours of their bosses - who may be hostile to flexitime or jobshare initiatives. \"For the employer it's the continuity factor,\" says Ruth Lea, head of policy at the Institute of Directors. \"Employees have responsibilities as well as rights. If you're a PA to a go-getting chap or woman, you've got to be there.\" </p> <p>She argues that recent legislation has only made it harder for women to break through the glass ceiling. \"When we surveyed our members, 45% said they found women of child-bearing age less attractive to employ than other groups. Basically, you've got to make a hard choice. The future is not female - the truth is if you are talking about the workplace there are a lot of constrictions and limitations.\" </p> <p>Her assessment is shocking, partly because it contrasts so sharply with the language of empowerment usually employed about working parents. And instead of believing the workplace will become more family-friendly, she thinks the future will be \"surprisingly similar to the present\". Childcare, believes Lea, is entirely the responsibility of the worker. \"When employers take people on, they know about their family commitments. But they expect them to be adult enough to be able to handle these pressures themselves. It's not up to us to do it.\" </p> <p>That view was painfully illustrated last week when a City lawyer won her case for unfair dismissal after contending that her boss deliberately increased her workload when she first became pregnant, and sacked her when she had her fourth child. Even though Aisling Sykes was prepared to take work home to carry on her 14-hour day, her employer, JP Morgan, wanted her in the office. Having children, Sykes claimed, was considered a lifestyle choice, like playing squash. </p> <p>If the Sykes case is an exceptional example (she was, after all, able to afford three full-time nannies), her dilemma does reflect a worrying trend. Merryn Wells, advice services manager for the Equal Opportunities Commission, tells the story of a pregnant PA who was forced to quit her job when she asked for a little compromise. </p> <p>\"She used to work long hours but once she got pregnant she asked her employer if she could work her contractual hours - 9am to 5pm. Basically, the employer said no, so she tried to work full-time after the birth and could not cope.

      "bodyText": "For the first months of your child's life you want to be at home without chucking your career out of the window. You are a parent working full-time but you need to pick up your children from school or nursery each day. You are bringing up children alone, and if one of them is sick and off school, you have no option but to skip work. These are the daily dilemmas facing the average working parent. But let's be honest. When we say parent, we really mean woman. For despite a raft of \"family friendly\" government policies, new technology and the emergence of a so-called softer management style, women are still bearing the brunt of childcare responsibility and are forced into making unhappy compromises between home, office and children. Traditionally, family pressures have often dictated the type of work women undertake. The secretarial sector has always attracted huge numbers of women, not least because its hours have been relatively child-friendly. But the dramatic change in the secretarial role, combined with a fitter and faster workplace, has conspired to make any job a juggling act of home and work pressures. It's not a joyful task. A survey by Lloyds/TSB revealed this month that in the last quarter of the 20th century, working mothers were the most dissatisfied group of people in society, thanks to the pressures of running a modern family. Wendy Neusone, 28, who has a two-year old son and works as a full-time secretary for the legal department of the Equal Opportunities Commission, knows those pressures too well. \"I set my standards quite high and I don't like to mention it if something goes wrong at home,\" she says. \"You do worry in case it's looked on badly. My husband is away on business a lot because he is a sales rep, and although he helps where he can, nine times out of ten the burden falls on me. It can be a struggle to balance it all.\" The government has changed the law to make it easier for women and especially lone parents to stay at work. The Working Family Tax Credit allows eligible parents to claim up to 70% of childcare costs. But with the average yearly cost for two children in full-time care around \u00a36,000, returning to work is still not economically feasible for many women earning middle or lower incomes. Campaigners argue that the only effective way to help working parents is to provide adequate childcare facilities, but currently only one in ten employers offer any kind of help, from creches to information service lines. So what if you could pick and choose your working hours? Neusone, for instance, works flexitime, which allows her to beat the rush-hour traffic and pick up her son before 6pm, when his nursery shuts. Flexibility is the latest buzzword and new patterns are attracting working parents, since flexitime allows employees to choose within set limits the times they start and finish work. Part-time employment, job-sharing and working from home are now protected by law and are attracting both men and women. But many employers resist the idea of a more fluid and flexible workforce, and workers in support roles are by definition often less free to design their own working schedules. They often need to shadow the hours of their bosses - who may be hostile to flexitime or jobshare initiatives. \"For the employer it's the continuity factor,\" says Ruth Lea, head of policy at the Institute of Directors. \"Employees have responsibilities as well as rights. If you're a PA to a go-getting chap or woman, you've got to be there.\" She argues that recent legislation has only made it harder for women to break through the glass ceiling. \"When we surveyed our members, 45% said they found women of child-bearing age less attractive to employ than other groups. Basically, you've got to make a hard choice. The future is not female - the truth is if you are talking about the workplace there are a lot of constrictions and limitations.\" Her assessment is shocking, partly because it contrasts so sharply with the language of empowerment usually employed about working parents. And instead of believing the workplace will become more family-friendly, she thinks the future will be \"surprisingly similar to the present\". Childcare, believes Lea, is entirely the responsibility of the worker. \"When employers take people on, they know about their family commitments. But they expect them to be adult enough to be able to handle these pressures themselves. It's not up to us to do it.\" That view was painfully illustrated last week when a City lawyer won her case for unfair dismissal after contending that her boss deliberately increased her workload when she first became pregnant, and sacked her when she had her fourth child. Even though Aisling Sykes was prepared to take work home to carry on her 14-hour day, her employer, JP Morgan, wanted her in the office. Having children, Sykes claimed, was considered a lifestyle choice, like playing squash. If the Sykes case is an exceptional example (she was, after all, able to afford three full-time nannies), her dilemma does reflect a worrying trend. Merryn Wells, advice services manager for the Equal Opportunities Commission, tells the story of a pregnant PA who was forced to quit her job when she asked for a little compromise. \"She used to work long hours but once she got pregnant she asked her employer if she could work her contractual hours - 9am to 5pm. Basically, the employer said no, so she tried to work full-time after the birth and could not cope. She felt she had no choice but to resign.\" Carolyn Jones, director of the Institute of Employment Rights, is depressed by this climate. \"I think back to when the former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson talked about the 'white heat' revolution of technology, predicting it would bring more leisure and family time. Something has gone wrong. Today we are working longer hours, for less pay and less leisure time.\" She argues that a flexible workforce makes business sense. \"If you adapt the workplace to the workers, you get a more committed team because they are not spending most of their energy simply juggling their lives.
