      "bodyText": "The United States secretly supported the ethnic Albanian extremists now behind insurgencies in Macedonia and southern Serbia. The CIA encouraged former Kosovo Liberation Army fighters to launch a rebellion in southern Serbia in an effort to undermine the then Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, according to senior European officers who served with the international peace-keeping force in Kosovo (K-For), as well as leading Macedonian and US sources. They accuse American forces with K-For of deliberately ignoring the massive smuggling of men and arms across Kosovo's borders. The accusations were made in a series of interviews by The Observer . They emerge as America has been forced into a rapid U-turn over its support for Albanian extremists in Kosovo seeking a 'Greater Kosovo' that would include Albanian communities in Serbia and Macedonia. In the past week ethnic Albanian guerrillas have intensified their campaign of attacks in the two areas, threatening a new war in the region which last week put US troops in the firing line in the Balkans for the first time. The accusations have led to tension in K-For between the European and US military missions. European officers are furious that the Ameri cans have allowed guerrilla armies in its sector to train, smuggle arms and launch attacks across two international borders. One European K-For battalion commander told The Observer yesterday: 'The CIA has been allowed to run riot in Kosovo with a private army designed to overthrow Slobodan Milosevic. Now he's gone the US State Department seems incapable of reining in its bastard army.' He added: 'Most of last year, there was a growing frustration with US support for the radical Albanians. US policy was and still is out of step with the other Nato allies.' The claim was backed by senior Macedonian officials in the capital, Skopje. 'What has been happening with the National Liberation Army [which has been responsible for a series of attacks on Macedonia's borders in recent weeks] and the UCPMB [its sister organisation in southern Serbia] is very similar to what happened when the KLA was launched in 1995-96,' said one. 'I will say only this: the US intelligence agencies have not been honest here.' The claims were given extra credence from an unexpected source - Arben Xhafari, leader of Macedonia's main Albanian party who tried to prevent the crisis on the border igniting an ethnic civil war inside Macedonia itself. A US State Department official blamed the last administration. There had now been 'a shift of emphasis'.",

      "body": "<p>My mother Francesca is 73. A little over seven years ago she gave up houses. She lives in a converted delivery van; an F-reg VW LT35. It contains a toilet, a shower, a fridge and a cooker, a small dining table and a fold-out bed. Not much else. </p> <p>In the summer, she goes north, visiting grandchildren and keeping up with old acquaintances. In the autumn, she migrates southwards to Portugal. </p> <p>When she started travelling, we, her children, put it down as eccentricity. An act of parental dottiness, perhaps, that she'd grow out of. But she shows no sign of doing so. What's more, as we fly out to visit her, two things become clear. </p> <p>First, she is enjoying herself. We dash in from our frantic work and family lives to find her over-wintering in the Algarve, chugging at a leisurely pace from place to place as the whim takes her. There she enjoys an excellent Da\u00f5 for under two quid a bottle. She knows a shop where a good gin will set you back \u00a32.50 a litre. A great olive oil is just as cheap. </p> <p>Secondly, she is not alone. If her lifestyle is an eccentric one, it is one she shares with tens of thousands of other northern European pensioners. </p> <p>Right now, parked up in motorhomes and caravans along Europe's southern shores, in Morocco, Sicily and Turkey, a massive army of Old Age Travellers sits sipping G&amp;Ts. It is a growing phenomenon: pensioners, fed up with the quality of life offered in our cold, dark winters, are deserting us. The resorts intended for the summer's lager louts are being taken over by another, more refined generation: the SAGA louts, the Old Age Travellers, the OATs. </p> <p>No one is quite sure how many OATs there are. The Caravan Club - which provides information and insurance to many of the British OATs - says: 'All we really know is that the number of people who live this lifestyle seems to be growing each year.' That's be cause, while some use official camp sites, many others call themselves 'free campers' - or, more romantically still, 'wild campers'. Much like the New Age Travellers before them, they make their homes on roadsides, waste ground, beauty spots and car parks. </p> <p>Like most, my mother started on camp sites where, if you book in for a few months, a pensioner can pay as little \u00a320 or \u00a330 a week on site fees in the winter. Five years ago, while visiting a mechanic in Silves to patch a chronic rust spot, she noticed a gaggle of vans parked by the river nearby, and asked if she could join them. There is, you quickly learn, a kind of camaraderie among the OATs, a collective sense that they're doing something naughtier than they should be doing at their age. </p> <p>Wild campers exchange news of which sites are the best: which have been closed, which have been discovered. 'The bush telegraph soon gets to work,' one newly converted 65-year-old says. 'They'll tell you where the water is. Where the best place is to empty your toilet.' </p> <p>Leaving my mother parked up at her site, I drive around some of her old haunts. Caba\u00f1as is a spot that has been popular for years. At the eastern end of a nondescript tourist development is small car park. Behind it, in the old dunes, are a few acres of scrub. Among the 20-odd huge white vehicles, there are the old familiar faces who pass through each year. Lance, a tattooed and combative septuagenarian, wanders about the site in shorts and sandals, boasting of the 150 watts he generates with his three solar panels. 'I can get four hours of satellite TV out of that,' he boasts. </p> <p>A few yards further inland, Richard boils a kettle for tea. 'Long-life milk, unfortunately,' he apologises. With Richard, everything is numbers and specifications. 'I have 42 lockers in my van,' he announces, proudly. He is 71. Since leaving the RAF, he's done a bit of everything. 'I've had 49 occupations,' he says. For a while, he was a hotelier. Latterly, he ran a letter-press printing service. He finally quit that after an American customer demanded that he mix Univers Expanded typeface with Optima. Richard wrinkles his nose: 'I don't like doing something if it's not right.' Like my mother, Richard is a full-timer. At his home in Devon, you might have mistaken Richard for a slightly finicky obsessive. But here, among the massive white-flowering broom bushes, he is transformed into something far more adventurous. </p> <p>Richard tells the story of how he started. He had loved camper vans since he borrowed one in '87. The woman who persuaded him to go full-time was his 91-year-old mother. One Christmas, Richard took her out of her nursing home and cooked her dinner in his van: she couldn't bear restaurants at her age. The seats were always wrong. That summer, Richard took his mother out of the home and the two started to work themselves slowly around Britain, visiting relations and equally ancient acquaintances. It was, says Richard with a broad smile on his face, 'bloody hard work. She was damn fussy. Impossibly exacting. It was a challenge.' </p> <p>The tour complete, the summer ended. He thinks she just gave up after that: she had done all she'd wanted to do. 'I took her to hospital. She was dead exactly a week later.' Richard's voice cracks and his eyes water. He takes a deep breath. 'It still hits,' he says quietly. That summer changed Richard. 'And I haven't slept in a house since.' </p> <p>The year before last, he finally burned his boats, selling up his house in Devon, cashing in his old Kontiki van and shelling out \u00a344,000 for an all-mod-cons Hymer motorhome. It's meticulously kept. Like Lance, Richard swears by his solar panels. But he uses his to power a household vacuum cleaner. 'That's my luxury,' he says, opening one of his 42 lockers to show it off. Proudly, he shows me his spotless bathroom. 'Only use liquid soap,' he cautions. 'Bar soap leaves scum.' </p> <p>Every OAT has a wealth of such tips. My mother, for example, advises that one should use white-wine vinegar to stop toilets from smelling: at 35p a litre, it's far cheaper than the proprietary brands. </p> <p>The OATs live a deliciously stripped-down existence: anything that doesn't fit in a van is jettisoned. My mother says the most successful present I ever gave her was a set of adhesive hooks. Technology is making life easier for the OATs. (Francesca is getting her first solar panel fixed as I write, though she has no plans yet for satellite TV.) These days, every traveller carries a mobile phone. Some use internet caf\u00e9s to keep in touch. </p> <p>Francesca sees no possible reason to stop travelling until physical infirmity forces her to. 'This van will last longer, much longer, than I will,' she says. </p> <p> A couple of years ago, my mother pulled on to the site at Caba\u00f1as, and had barely time to set up house before the Guarda Na\u00e7ional Republicana arrived, with mounted police, to turf her and her fellow OATs off the site. That winter, the GNR closed down Caba\u00f1as. But they had reckoned without the shopkeepers and restaurateurs. For them, their winter trade vanished with the camper vans. Besides, many have befriended the itinerant pensioners over the years. </p> <p>The shopkeepers threatened a boycott. The authorities backed down. Caba\u00f1as is open again. For now, at least. </p> <p>About 10 miles to the west, 68-year-old Norm announces: 'In three or four years, it'll be finished.' People are going to look back and realise that this was the golden period, he says. Norm reckons 95 per cent of the motorhomes here are owned by pensioners. </p> <p>Norm is another full-timer. A bluff, rotund Londoner, he's been camping since 1946. 'But I've been in motorcaravans for 26 years,' he says proudly. He and his wife Paul (Pauline) gave up a house in Enfield for van number nine, and shelled out \u00a355,000 for their Hymer. 'With garage,' Norm jokes, showing off the huge locker at the rear where they sometimes store their Honda C70. </p> <p>Hardcore OATs know each others' vans, flashing headlights as they pass each other. You'd recognise Norm and Paul if you saw them: their numberplate is POO 100. </p> <p>Right now, Norm and Paul are travelling with three other couples: a Belgian, a Dutch woman, two New Zealanders and two fellow Brits. The men have spent the morning hooking up one of their motorhomes to Norm's generator using a bewildering conjunction of cables and chargers that stretches across the gravel. For men who tinker, OAT-ing offers endless opportunities. </p> <p>Now the cooperative has moved on to tackling the next shared task. Lunch. The Belgian, Alfons, arranges the tables in the hot winter sunshine. Frank, a white-haired man, appears with a tablecloth and a couple of bottles of Cte du Rhone. Alfons peels a prickly pear, carefully. Sometimes he picks the wild asparagus that grows here in midwinter. The marshes here are full of fresh samphire, too. </p> <p>'Look at what you've got. You go to different places. You meet different people. Right now we've got four nationalities here. It's a friendship,' says Norm, expansively. </p> <p>It's impossible to disagree. OATs make the same point, over and over. At home, they would spent their winters sitting inside, seeing few people, slowly vegetating. </p> <p> Until her late forties, my mother had always travelled. She grew up in Italy, Egypt and the Balkans, the daughter of a Times foreign correspondent. Marrying a man with equally itchy feet, she raised her children in the Sudan, Afghanistan, Brazil, Nigeria and Ghana. When my father left her, she landed with a bump in Leeds. For 20 years she stuck it out, but it almost drove her nuts. Now she's travelling again: you can see how happy she is. </p> <p>Tonight, she's parked at Quatra Aguas, just outside the port of Tavira. She's cooking dinner by candlelight. Curlew song drifts over the salt pans around her. Storks nest on the chimney stacks of abandoned canning factories. Avocets, redshanks and spoonbills still pick their way through the mud around the old quay in the dying light. In a few weeks, the flamingos will start appearing. </p> <p>Most people travel as couples: single women travellers are fairly rare. 'Some people say, \"Oooh you are brave!\"' says Francesca, sipping a glass of wine. 'To which I reply: \"I'd have to be a damn sight braver sitting it out in my street in Leeds.\"'</p>",

It is not yet clear if they will be allowed to reopen before the ski season finishes soon after Easter.

It was the weirdest packing I'd ever done for a holiday, but at least it was ea sy to recognise other members of our party at the airport. They were the ones with the strange - shaped luggage: bubble-wrapped spades and hoes, kneeling pads, garden shears and loppers. </p> <p>We were an organic gardening brigade on our way to dig city vegetable plots in Havana, and in so doing to help Cuba survive the United States economic embargo, with which the most powerful nation in the world hopes to intimidate the most obstinate. </p> <p>I expected my fellow organic embargo-busters to be chisel-jawed men and rosy-cheeked, head-scarved women out of a Fifties constructivist poster. Alas, no. We were all surprisingly ordinary: dietician, therapist, artist, designer, maintenance man and a dozen more, including three professional gardeners. </p> <p>Top of the age range were the brigadistas for whom the Cuban revolution once represented a romantic revolutionary ideal, or at least a poster of Che Guevara on some 1968 student bedroom wall. At the younger end were those for whom the triumph of Fidel Castro's revolutionaries in 1959 is now as ancient a piece of history as the Russian Re volution. Their commitment was to a better organic world - and maybe also to Havana's legendary nightlife. </p> <p>For whatever reason, we were on our way to Havana to work in the capital's huertos, small urban vegetable plots, and to dance a bit, drink and swim from beautiful beaches. Jet-lagged and culture shocked, our first serious problem was the least expected: the weather. We hit a rare cold patch, cold enough for us to wear fleeces and jackets intended only for the cold British end of the journey. </p> <p>The first morning, I wandered down to the nearest bit of seafront, a ghost town of a Fifties holiday resort, with an empty swimming pool, crumbling concrete balustrades and run-down hotels. A furious sea was thumping waves on to the potholed promenade, leaving in its wake bulbous blue creatures which turned out to be Portuguese men-of-war. I am not brave about jellyfish. </p> <p>This wasn't quite the Caribbean idyll I'd had in mind. Lesson one: don't go to Cuba with fixed ideas. </p> <p>A couple of days later, shovelling compost into black plastic bags and planting saplings in a fruit tree nursery, I started to warm up. Since these were destined for city plots to provide food and/or medicine, it felt useful. Carlos, the fruit farmer, beamed with pleasure at our labour. The sun, and a different Cuba, started to emerge. </p> <p>We fell into a pattern: a bit of digging in a huerto, or organic farm, usually with some talk about Cuba's organic revolution or herbal medicine triumphs. We did a lot of listening. Cubans can really talk. And they love you for listening, maybe because they feel strongly that the rest of the world isn't. </p> <p>It is barely 10 years since Cuba lost four-fifths of its income with the collapse of the Soviet bloc economies. The impact was felt most keenly in the food sector: Cuba imported more than half its calorific intake, and was particularly dependent on imported protein. Even the food that Cuba grew herself needed fertilisers and pesticides, 80 per cent of them imported. The urgent problem was to feed Havana, whose 2.5 million residents were 20 per cent of the population. </p> <p>Without the chemicals, yields dropped dramatically. In the mid-Nineties there were food riots, and thousands of people tried to flee abroad. But Cuba has slowly recovered. Overall, food production in Havana grew from 40,000 tonnes in 1995 to 115,000 in 1998, all of it organic. We are here to make a tiny contribution, and to listen. </p> <p>But the evenings are for music and mojitos (a cocktail of rum, lime, sugar and mint leaves). Music is everywhere and almost always excellent. Modern disco music has been banished to the tourist resorts, so the sounds of central Havana are the traditional son, rumba, danzon and bolero - sounds that, thanks to Ry Cooder and the Buena Vista Social Club, the entire Western world has now gone mad for. </p> <p>One night four or five of us followed our ears and found what appeared to be a Buena Vista tribute band of eight elderly men, one of whom seemed frighteningly close to keeling over as he performed a spirited solo dance. After playing the obligatory 'Chan Chan' - now almost Cuba's second national anthem - the group had a break and a concerned lady friend took the dancing man's pulse and solicitously fed him a cake. </p> <p>We bought their CD, which they all signed with shaky signatures, telling us they hoped to be at Ronnie Scott's in London in the summer, so watch out for Ren\u00e9 Son. At about 11pm, as the rest of Havana started to emerge for dancing, the band ambled off. </p> <p>Another night, when the waves were crashing over the sea defences on to the Malecon, Havana's waterfront promenade - in normal weather, this is where young lovers sit listening to the soft lapping of the tropical sea below - we returned to explore the nightlife of our own sleepy suburb of Miramar. I later learnt that Castro and his student revolutionary buddies used to meet in Miramar to plot the overthrow of Batista. </p> <p>Inland from our hotel we found ourselves among the posher houses. 'There won't be any music here - they wouldn't allow it,' I said with total certainty. That was the cue for a dramatic drum burst and flashing lights. </p> <p>We turned up a drive into a magical garden party with a full-blooded dance band and a fabulously robed, deep-throated black woman singer,who strutted among the audience punctuating her singing with a commentary. </p> <p>We paid nothing, though such a venue could cost up to $40 in town, and the dancing went on for hours. We wouldn't have grudged paying, but the hunger for dollars elsewhere is beginning to corrupt. When the average doctor or fruit farmer earns only $5 (about \u00a33) a week, it feels wrong to hand over two or three weeks' salary just to dance. </p> <p>So far, Cuba lives with these contradictions mainly by keeping tourists and Cubans apart. But why would you choose to visit such an inefficient, crumbling country with its shortages and cold snaps and jellyfish and poor service if it weren't for the people? The best thing about visiting Cuba is meeting and working with the proud, stubborn and witty people that so infuriate the giant across the water.

But why would you choose to visit such an inefficient, crumbling country with its shortages and cold snaps and jellyfish and poor service if it weren't for the people? The best thing about visiting Cuba is meeting and working with the proud, stubborn and witty people that so infuriate the giant across the water. And the music... How to arrange a working holiday in Cuba \u0095 Organic gardening holidays cost around \u00a3950, including flights, good hotel accommodation, with breakfast and evening meal, a work programme and additional cultural visits. The Cuba Organic Support Group is at 58 Broad Lane, Coventry CV5 7AF. Tel: 024 7667 3491. \u0095 A more spartan working holiday can be arranged through the Cuba Solidarity Campaign. Brigadistas live for three weeks in a purpose-built camp near Havana and do farm or construction work alongside Cubans. The programme includes visits to factories, hospitals, schools and the like. Trips cost around \u00a3750, including air fare, basic accommodation, food and some visits. Send SAE to CSC, 129 Seven Sisters Road, London, N7 7QG. Tel: 020 7263 6452. \u0095 The US-based Send A Piana to Havana (sic) campaign organises annual brigades of piano tuners and technicians to restore clapped-out Cuban pianos and help train Cuban tuners. Participants stay in dormitory-like accommodation. \u0095 Combine learning Latin-American Spanish with voluntary work through Languages Abroad. \u0095 The School of Latin American Spanish, Docklands Enterprise Centre, 11 Marshalsea Road, London SE1 1EP, offers seven-week courses in Cuba. Tel: 020 7237 2197 \u0095 In December, the Antonio Nu\u00f1ez Jimenez Foundation for Nature and Man offers an 11-day photography and cave exploration expedition. Tuition, photographic materials, travel within Cuba and accommodation is included in the $550 (about \u00a3366) price. For further information email virginia@fanj.cult.cu \u0095 Arts courses are offered by the Instituto Superior de Arte's Oficina de Relaciones. Email isa@reduniv.edu.cu \u0095 For further information contact the Cuban embassy and tourist office: 154 Shaftesbury Ave, London WC2H 8JT. Tel: 020 7240 6655. Tourist cards are valid for one month. Passports must have at least six months to run. Flying there - British Airways (0845 773 3377). Returns start at \u00a3496; Cubana (020 7734 1165) has returns from \u00a3401; Iberia (020 7830 0011) offers returns from \u00a3406.

      "body": "<p>The prospect of driving from London to Cornwall did not excite me and, besides, I thought it would be nice - and a bit special - to take my 10-year-old daughter on the sleeper from Paddington. And, sure enough, she enjoyed the doll's house-size of our compartment, the staying up late, the little switches, the fold-down basin, the bunk bed, the furtiveness, and the thrill of knowing we'd be waking up in Cornwall. </p> <p>Her dad, however, didn't wake up in Cornwall. Because, to wake up, you have to go to sleep. Sadly, this didn't happen. More sleepless than sleeper. Perhaps it was just me, but the modest compartment meant that lying in bed was akin to trying to sleep on an ironing board travelling at 60mph. Only less comfortable. </p> <p>So it wasn't in the best possible spirits that we landed in St Austell at 7am (though my daughter, naturally, slept brilliantly). St Austell is almost certainly a sweet little town but arriving on a dark, damp, misty morning isn't as exciting as it sounds. </p> <p>Things took a turn for the worse when I asked the taxi driver if there was anywhere to have breakfast. 'At this hour of the morning?' </p> <p>We trooped off towards a newsagent which was, remarkably, open. 'Breakfast? Nobody gets up before nine around here.' After sensing our desperation (perhaps sparked by my disbelieving... 'Nine?... What, nowhere?... Really?'), he asked if a Little Chef would do. Do? DO? Absolutely, fantastic that would be. </p> <p>And so, 25 minutes later having completed the '10-15 minute walk' we settled into a roadside Little Chef and spent an unfeasibly long 90 minutes warming up and eating muffins. </p> <p>If there is a moral to this tale, it may be that whatever else you say about the Eden Project, it is conceivable that the surrounding towns may not be geared up to take advantage of what may be about to occur in a deprived corner of the county. </p> <p>The taxi ride to the <a href=\"http://www.edenproject.com\">Eden Project</a> from St Austell is a little longer than 10 minutes. You leave the town and head out into a desolate landscape. Craters and disused china clay-pits. And not much else. And then, suddenly, you glimpse the top of one of the domes; teasingly it disappears as you spin away, then you catch another glimpse and finally you wind your way down and there, in the middle of absolutely nothing, is this most remarkable of sights. Four interconnecting domes on either side of a grass-roofed building nestling in an excavated, landscaped crater. It looks incongruous and wonderful - this most modern of buildings nestling next to earth and clay and grass and gravel. It looks as though it has landed rather than been built. </p> <p>For many people the attraction of the Eden Project will be in the horticulture and the botany and the plants. But for others it will be experiencing Nicholas Grimshaw's buildings. There are, after all, dozens of conservatories throughout Britain - but none looks like this. This is not so much a building as an event. </p> <p>The visitor centre, which stands on a raised cliff opposite the domes, offers a splendid vantage point (complete with viewing deck). You can look out at the landscaped garden which winds its way down the crater and laps on to the domes. </p> <p>The centre - all hardwood, steel, glass and warm curves - is itself beautifully designed. From this moment the project immediately feels meant - handsome, solid, and confident. Once you've paid through the barriers you can dawdle in the shop or the cafe or read a few Blue Peter -style manifesto boards. </p> <p>From there it is a short walk through the landscaped gardens and into the 'biomes'. To the left is the Humid Tropic Biome, a massive bulbous structure of four interconnecting domes. Simply to stand and gawp is terrific, even if you never venture inside. To find this building anywhere would be a treat, to happen on it in the middle of a cratered countryside adds to the mystique. </p> <p>Step inside and you are immediately transported to a tropical rainforest - the sight all the more remarkable because the vegetation rises up the cliff opposite. Momentarily you can forget you're in an oversize glasshouse. By the time you walk to the top through myriad paths and walkways you look down on the hissing, misting greenery (hundreds of sprinklers spray mist every five minutes) and you half expect Francis Ford Coppola to send in a fleet of helicopters so he can begin shooting his latest film. It feels that real. </p> <p>Needless to say it's hot, with palms, a rubber plantation and a mangrove swamp among the plants from the Amazon, Malaysia, the Oceanic Islands and West Africa. So it's best to go dressed in layers which you can then shed as you shuffle about. </p> <p>The grass-covered roof building in the middle houses a huge restaurant and on the other side is the Warm Temperate Biome. Here you have a dry, hard heat with plants from the Mediterranean, California and South Africa - olive trees, vineyards and flowers. </p> <p>The landscaped garden outside is a third zone - the Cool Temperate Biome. This showcases plants from Britain and - as it benefits from the Gulf Stream and is a sheltered cratered valley - it will sustain vegetation from New Zealand, Chile and Australia. </p> <p>There will be a battery of initiatives at the Eden Project - educational ones, and artistic ones and all manner of ways of interacting with plant life (the Cool Temperate Biome will eventually grow tea which will be sold at a tea stall). They have lots of ideas, plans, and dreams - the people strike you not so much as workers as disciples- hugely enthused by the 'project' and quite evangelical with it. It feels a bit like Glastonbury with plants. </p> <p>There is, it seems, some debate as to whether the Eden Project is horticulturally sound - whether the science is being in some way debased by commerce. Some claim it's Disney with dahlias. Not that that sounds like such a bad idea. </p> <p>But this doesn't feel like Disney. There is an Eden Institution to monitor and develop its science, and much of the curator talent has been scooped up from Kew. It feels genuine. Many people who will never visit Kew or other conservatories will be attracted by the triumphant and giddy architecture and the Eden's sense of fun and excitement. It will undoubtedly open up to a new audience who may, literally, stumble on the plants having come merely to sample the project. </p> <p>It cost less than \u00a340 million of millennium funding (an equal amount was raised from a variety of other sources) and it will draw favourable comparisons with the other dome. It's the idea of Tim Smit (who restored the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall) but he was helped by others, not least the architect Nicholas Grimshaw, who originally agreed to work on it for free, such was his enthusiasm for the project. </p> <p>Michael Heseltine and Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair and Charlie Falconer and the others who plundered \u00a3750m for a one-year theme park should visit the Eden Project and see what can be achieved when the driving force is not political fashion but fierce passion. </p> <p>See what can be achieved when the motivation is an exciting idea, not an expedient initiative. The difference with the other dome is plain to see - here you had a guiding principle pursued with real vigour towards a clear objective. Now, suppose you offered that other dome to Tim Smit?</p> <p>\u0095 Tickets: Adults \u00a39.50, Children 5-15 \u00a34.00, Under-fives free, OAPs \u00a37.50, Students \u00a35, Family ticket \u00a322.

St Austell is almost certainly a sweet little town but arriving on a dark, damp, misty morning isn't as exciting as it sounds. Things took a turn for the worse when I asked the taxi driver if there was anywhere to have breakfast. 'At this hour of the morning?' We trooped off towards a newsagent which was, remarkably, open. 'Breakfast? Nobody gets up before nine around here.' After sensing our desperation (perhaps sparked by my disbelieving... 'Nine?... What, nowhere?... Really?'), he asked if a Little Chef would do. Do? DO? Absolutely, fantastic that would be. And so, 25 minutes later having completed the '10-15 minute walk' we settled into a roadside Little Chef and spent an unfeasibly long 90 minutes warming up and eating muffins. If there is a moral to this tale, it may be that whatever else you say about the Eden Project, it is conceivable that the surrounding towns may not be geared up to take advantage of what may be about to occur in a deprived corner of the county. The taxi ride to the Eden Project from St Austell is a little longer than 10 minutes. You leave the town and head out into a desolate landscape. Craters and disused china clay-pits. And not much else. And then, suddenly, you glimpse the top of one of the domes; teasingly it disappears as you spin away, then you catch another glimpse and finally you wind your way down and there, in the middle of absolutely nothing, is this most remarkable of sights. Four interconnecting domes on either side of a grass-roofed building nestling in an excavated, landscaped crater. It looks incongruous and wonderful - this most modern of buildings nestling next to earth and clay and grass and gravel. It looks as though it has landed rather than been built. For many people the attraction of the Eden Project will be in the horticulture and the botany and the plants. But for others it will be experiencing Nicholas Grimshaw's buildings. There are, after all, dozens of conservatories throughout Britain - but none looks like this. This is not so much a building as an event. The visitor centre, which stands on a raised cliff opposite the domes, offers a splendid vantage point (complete with viewing deck). You can look out at the landscaped garden which winds its way down the crater and laps on to the domes. The centre - all hardwood, steel, glass and warm curves - is itself beautifully designed. From this moment the project immediately feels meant - handsome, solid, and confident. Once you've paid through the barriers you can dawdle in the shop or the cafe or read a few Blue Peter -style manifesto boards. From there it is a short walk through the landscaped gardens and into the 'biomes'. To the left is the Humid Tropic Biome, a massive bulbous structure of four interconnecting domes. Simply to stand and gawp is terrific, even if you never venture inside. To find this building anywhere would be a treat, to happen on it in the middle of a cratered countryside adds to the mystique. Step inside and you are immediately transported to a tropical rainforest - the sight all the more remarkable because the vegetation rises up the cliff opposite. Momentarily you can forget you're in an oversize glasshouse. By the time you walk to the top through myriad paths and walkways you look down on the hissing, misting greenery (hundreds of sprinklers spray mist every five minutes) and you half expect Francis Ford Coppola to send in a fleet of helicopters so he can begin shooting his latest film. It feels that real. Needless to say it's hot, with palms, a rubber plantation and a mangrove swamp among the plants from the Amazon, Malaysia, the Oceanic Islands and West Africa. So it's best to go dressed in layers which you can then shed as you shuffle about. The grass-covered roof building in the middle houses a huge restaurant and on the other side is the Warm Temperate Biome. Here you have a dry, hard heat with plants from the Mediterranean, California and South Africa - olive trees, vineyards and flowers. The landscaped garden outside is a third zone - the Cool Temperate Biome. This showcases plants from Britain and - as it benefits from the Gulf Stream and is a sheltered cratered valley - it will sustain vegetation from New Zealand, Chile and Australia. There will be a battery of initiatives at the Eden Project - educational ones, and artistic ones and all manner of ways of interacting with plant life (the Cool Temperate Biome will eventually grow tea which will be sold at a tea stall). They have lots of ideas, plans, and dreams - the people strike you not so much as workers as disciples- hugely enthused by the 'project' and quite evangelical with it. It feels a bit like Glastonbury with plants. There is, it seems, some debate as to whether the Eden Project is horticulturally sound - whether the science is being in some way debased by commerce. Some claim it's Disney with dahlias. Not that that sounds like such a bad idea. But this doesn't feel like Disney. There is an Eden Institution to monitor and develop its science, and much of the curator talent has been scooped up from Kew. It feels genuine. Many people who will never visit Kew or other conservatories will be attracted by the triumphant and giddy architecture and the Eden's sense of fun and excitement. It will undoubtedly open up to a new audience who may, literally, stumble on the plants having come merely to sample the project. It cost less than \u00a340 million of millennium funding (an equal amount was raised from a variety of other sources) and it will draw favourable comparisons with the other dome. It's the idea of Tim Smit (who restored the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall) but he was helped by others, not least the architect Nicholas Grimshaw, who originally agreed to work on it for free, such was his enthusiasm for the project. Michael Heseltine and Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair and Charlie Falconer and the others who plundered \u00a3750m for a one-year theme park should visit the Eden Project and see what can be achieved when the driving force is not political fashion but fierce passion. See what can be achieved when the motivation is an exciting idea, not an expedient initiative. The difference with the other dome is plain to see - here you had a guiding principle pursued with real vigour towards a clear objective. Now, suppose you offered that other dome to Tim Smit? \u0095 Tickets: Adults \u00a39.50, Children 5-15 \u00a34.00, Under-fives free, OAPs \u00a37.50, Students \u00a35, Family ticket \u00a322.

      "body": "<p>Six years ago it was a self-professed hobby for its founders; today Yahoo! is a global brand that personifies the new information economy and American technological leadership as much as Microsoft or Apple do. No other country could have done what the Americans have done with their information technology revolution; the mixture of innovation, technical daring and swashbuckling attitude to financial risk is something the rest of the world can only envy. Who has not tried Yahoo! as a search engine and internet portal?</p> <p>But last week even the mighty Yahoo! joined the list of dotcom and IT companies either in the graveyard or fatally wounded - and raised fundamental questions about the durability and sustainability of the dotcom revolution. As its advertising revenues buckle and share price plunges, its chief executive was asked to leave - but who wants to take on a job that is almost condemned to fail? Yahoo!'s share price once stood at a mighty $220 - now it trades at less than a tenth that. What the American system delivers, it also takes away. Maybe Europeans should be just a little less credulous about the US - and prouder of their own economic and social model. For Yahoo! is not one of the frothier products of the hi-tech boom, it is absolutely at its heart. It has built advertising revenues of some $1 billion a year, and it should be able to make a profit; it is rich in cash and if any IT company can survive the US economic downturn it should be Yahoo!. But its apparent durability has proved illusory. Yahoo! was made possible only by the boom in hi-tech shares; that is how it raised its cash and, because other dotcom companies advertised on its websites, what fuelled its revenue growth. But that same boom has left all the companies built around it with profound structural weaknesses.</p> <p>For they are organisations whose organisational glue is greed. Yahoo!'s founders have become rich, and the attraction for those that came to work at Yahoo! was a chance to make similar fortunes; hence the way its senior managers chose to be paid not in orthodox salaries but in share options. But as the shares ail and the options are worthless, the reality is not the promise of wealth - but day-to-day poverty and gruelling hours in a failing business. They leave and can't be replaced.</p> <p>Nor are the founders any more committed. They have made their fortunes, and sold their shares to others; and those others, as in a game of musical chairs, were hoping to pass on their shares at inflated prices to some greater fool. This has always been the case in stock markets whose casino proclivities are never far from the surface, but the dotcom revolution has made the issue starker than ever. The average length of time a Yahoo! shareholder holds Yahoo! shares is seven days. If any incoming chief executive is hoping for a committed shareholder base to support a painful restructuring, they can think again. The fate of Yahoo! is obvious; massive retrenchment, takeover sooner or later to release 'value' - and eventual emasculation.</p> <p>This process, now increasing in severity, has been at work in the US for the past 30 years, undermining its technological leadership and slowing down its productivity growth. Only 10 years ago American bookshops were full of volumes detailing the decline in American industry and Sunday morning chat shows crammed with pundits offering their own pet solutions. It was in this mood of gloom that Clinton won the 1992 presidential election with the cry of 'It's the economy, stupid.'</p> <p>The arrival of the new economy, a long stock market boom and a record of jobs growth that was much better than Europe's changed that perception - but we are about to discover that the old account was much nearer the truth than the recent wave of over the top enthusiasm.

      "bodyText": "Six years ago it was a self-professed hobby for its founders; today Yahoo! is a global brand that personifies the new information economy and American technological leadership as much as Microsoft or Apple do. No other country could have done what the Americans have done with their information technology revolution; the mixture of innovation, technical daring and swashbuckling attitude to financial risk is something the rest of the world can only envy. Who has not tried Yahoo! as a search engine and internet portal? But last week even the mighty Yahoo! joined the list of dotcom and IT companies either in the graveyard or fatally wounded - and raised fundamental questions about the durability and sustainability of the dotcom revolution. As its advertising revenues buckle and share price plunges, its chief executive was asked to leave - but who wants to take on a job that is almost condemned to fail? Yahoo!'s share price once stood at a mighty $220 - now it trades at less than a tenth that. What the American system delivers, it also takes away. Maybe Europeans should be just a little less credulous about the US - and prouder of their own economic and social model. For Yahoo! is not one of the frothier products of the hi-tech boom, it is absolutely at its heart. It has built advertising revenues of some $1 billion a year, and it should be able to make a profit; it is rich in cash and if any IT company can survive the US economic downturn it should be Yahoo!. But its apparent durability has proved illusory. Yahoo! was made possible only by the boom in hi-tech shares; that is how it raised its cash and, because other dotcom companies advertised on its websites, what fuelled its revenue growth. But that same boom has left all the companies built around it with profound structural weaknesses. For they are organisations whose organisational glue is greed. Yahoo!'s founders have become rich, and the attraction for those that came to work at Yahoo! was a chance to make similar fortunes; hence the way its senior managers chose to be paid not in orthodox salaries but in share options. But as the shares ail and the options are worthless, the reality is not the promise of wealth - but day-to-day poverty and gruelling hours in a failing business. They leave and can't be replaced. Nor are the founders any more committed. They have made their fortunes, and sold their shares to others; and those others, as in a game of musical chairs, were hoping to pass on their shares at inflated prices to some greater fool. This has always been the case in stock markets whose casino proclivities are never far from the surface, but the dotcom revolution has made the issue starker than ever. The average length of time a Yahoo! shareholder holds Yahoo! shares is seven days. If any incoming chief executive is hoping for a committed shareholder base to support a painful restructuring, they can think again. The fate of Yahoo! is obvious; massive retrenchment, takeover sooner or later to release 'value' - and eventual emasculation. This process, now increasing in severity, has been at work in the US for the past 30 years, undermining its technological leadership and slowing down its productivity growth. Only 10 years ago American bookshops were full of volumes detailing the decline in American industry and Sunday morning chat shows crammed with pundits offering their own pet solutions. It was in this mood of gloom that Clinton won the 1992 presidential election with the cry of 'It's the economy, stupid.' The arrival of the new economy, a long stock market boom and a record of jobs growth that was much better than Europe's changed that perception - but we are about to discover that the old account was much nearer the truth than the recent wave of over the top enthusiasm. Don't get me wrong. I am writing this column, which I will email to The Observer , on a Dell laptop using a Microsoft Word programme. I am more than aware of what I owe American technology. I also believe the consequences of the information and communication revolution will be transforming. What I don't accept is that the system that incubated the revolution is best able to exploit it - or that Europe should copy it in every respect.

The list goes on. All are business sectors where Americans can no longer claim technological leadership - and all because, just like Yahoo!, the stock market's appetite for short-term gains and accompanying short-term time horizons has undermined the capacity to innovate. The US likes to blame subsidy for the reason that Airbus is going to build the next generation of wide-bodied superjumbos; the real explanation is that Wall Street would no more back Boeing in a $10bn development than pigs can fly. But, you will be shaking your head, what about American productivity growth and their record in job generation? Will Hutton is losing his marbles.

      "body": "<p>Who would have believed it? Certainly not one of the insecure trio who invented. New Labour. Had you told Tony Blair four years ago that the Conservatives would become such an outlandish irrelevance that right-wing newspapers, the natural prejudices of their editors and proprietors outvoted by their readers, would be falling over each other to declare that he had his second term in the bag, Mr Blair would have suggested you should seek help from a psychiatrist.</p> <p>Had you told Gordon Brown that he would be near-universally applauded as Golden Brown, the outstanding Chancellor of modern times, he would have told you he had more important things to do than listen to silly jokes.</p> <p>Had you told Peter Mandelson that the Government would be cruising to re-election with a double-figure poll lead, even though Tony Blair had not once, but twice, sacked him from the Cabinet, Mr Mandelson would have archly inquired how long you had been a user of hallucinogenic drugs. He would have been calling for a straitjacket before you had a chance to explain how it was that he was completely exonerated by the official inquiry into his second dismissal and yet his great friend, Tony Blair, was still insistent that Peter Mandelson's brilliant career was history.</p> <p>These past four days have exemplified the best and the worst of the last four years. The Budget placed the central accomplishment of this government on self-confident display. The inquiry into the Hinduja affair exposed the chaos and hysteria of New Labour's private life.</p> <p>Gordon Brown personified the assured side of the Government, as his acolytes, chafing in anticipation of the hour when their master supplants Mr Blair as Prime Minister, have not been shy of pointing out. So monumental is his mastery of this moment that the Chancellor could afford to disdain the theatrics traditionally associated with pre-election Budgets. He steamrollered through his disbursements with the \u00e9lan of a man reading from the Treasury phone directory. Where every one of his Labour predecessors ended an invariably brutish and short period in office swamped by financial calamity, charged with betrayal by his party and mistrusted by the electorate, this Labour Chancellor dominates economy, country, and Cabinet.</p> <p>With a magisterially casual sweep of the arm, he announced that the spending Ministers would later fill in the tedious details he had dictated to them, as if the rest of the Cabinet were his Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. The Treasury, in the words of one Blairite, is presently 'rampant' within government. With most of the emphasis on measures to please the heartlands, bar a tax cut worth 69p a week, there were virtually no concessions to the 'new' part of the New Labour coalition.</p> <p>The Chancellor's supporters tend to be rather contemptuous of the Prime Minister's obsession with sweetening Middle Britain. They are reluctant to concede that Tony Blair can sometimes be right. Yet Mr Brown can be too cunning for his own good. His habit of raising revenues by stealth, a scheme, I often think, designed not so much to fool the country as to sneak tax rises past the wary eyes of Number 10, has led him to put up the burden on more than a million middle-earners just before polling day. That was gratuitous and unnecessary from a Chancellor presiding over a surplus in excess of \u00a320 billion.</p> <p>It is not quite right to say that his was not a pre-election Budget. Mr Brown, who looks further ahead than most of us, simply has a different election in mind. He has so arranged things that money will really be pouring into public services by the mid-term of the next parliament, just the moment when he hopes that Mr Blair will honour his promise, if such a pledge truly exists beyond the realms of rumour, to retire in favour of the older man.</p> <p>The Chancellor's power and ambition cause queasiness among those protective of the Prime Minister. They will have gagged at a magazine cover depicting a diminutive Blair perched on the knee of a titanic Brown. Yet his achievements are undeniable even to his detractors. If Gordon Brown is an arrogant man, he has much to be arrogant about. For the first time in more than a century, Labour has successfully married competent stewardship of the economy to social justice. The terms of political trade with the Conservatives have been inverted. Throughout the Eighties and the first half of the Nineties, the Tories used the menace of tax rises to exclude the Left from power. In a total reversal of fortune, now Mr Brown makes the Tory threat to cut his spending on public services the dividing issue, a change which is massively to Labour's advantage. When Labour wins its first proper second term ever, to him will go a massive share of credit. As unrivalled chieftain of the election campaign, he is positioned to attempt to grab all of it.</p> <p>There was a revealing moment during his Budget performance, a moment that illustrated that body language can sometimes speak more eloquently than a thousand words. Finishing his speech to ritual flapping from Labour MPs and a profound cloud of depression over the Tories, the Chancellor sat down to a con gratulatory pat on the left arm from Tony Blair. If the granite sphinx of the Treasury felt it, he did not show it. Acknowledging his neighbour not at all, the Chancellor pursed his lips and continued to stare ahead. Consciously or not, he seemed to want to indicate that he was much too colossal to need the endorsement of the mere Prime Minister.</p> <p>Behind the turbulent couple, amid the sea of happy-clappy faces of Labour MPs, we could just make out the third man. Palely loitering on a distant backbench sat the ghost of Peter Mandelson, spectre at the pre-election feast. He is now, thanks to the Hammond inquiry, if not exactly resurrected, at least raised the ranks of the undead.</p> <p>Sir Anthony Hammond is known to his friends as Wally. I had assumed that this must be a jocular reference to Antipodean antecedents. Having read his report, I'm now inclined to believe that the sobriquet indicates Sir Wally's credulity. Everyone, he tells us, acted out of the best possible motives. Everyone is telling the truth, even when their accounts of the tangled events that led to the Mandelson resignation are palpably contradictory.</p> <p>Our Wally's investigations have not located a smoking gun. There might be a smoking post-it note, but that has been lost. At most, there is a smouldering mango. You can find it, like nearly all of the interesting bits of the Hammond report, buried in the appendix. We learn that the Hinduja brothers showered the former Northern Ireland Secretary with gifts of the exotic fruit. My own inquiries can reveal that Mr Mandelson disposed of these mangoes by presenting them as a substitute for the usual flowers or chocolates to unsuspecting hostesses who had invited him for dinner. Sir Wally concludes that no one is to be blamed for anything. True to the tradition of internal investigations by a civil servant, his conclusions paint everything and everyone in Whitehall magnolia.</p> <p>And yet the report should not be just dismissed as whitewash. Intentionally or not, Sir Wally casts the most unforgiving light on the inner wirings of this Government. We learn, with further and damaging particulars, about New Labour's weakness for rich men of - ahem - fascinating provenance. The Foreign Office warned that 'at the very least, the Hinduja brothers sailed close to the wind in building their business empire' and granting them citizenship could bring 'embarrassment' on Britain. Sir Wally carefully reports that the secret services had gathered 'a certain amount of intelligence', raising the possibility that the Indian billionaires might have been involved in 'dubious practices, in some cases potentially amounting to criminal behaviour'. Mr Mandelson wrote a minute describing the brothers as 'above average risk' and wondering how to 'reduce our exposure to them'. And yet the Hindujas were allowed to draw the Prime Minister, and a startling array of his colleagues, into their orbit.</p> <p>You can see more clearly why Mr Mandelson feels so acutely wronged. His head alone has been stuck on the spike when so many others, notably Keith Vaz, remain in office even though they were entangled with the brothers. In the memo he wrote for the Prime Minister on the evening before the defenestration, the Cabinet Secretary suggested that 'the line should simply be' that 'no one has produced a shred of evidence that anything improper took place'. Observe how Sir Richard Wilson, that august and most senior of civil servants, has become so immersed in New Labour's presentationally driven culture that he writes 'the line should simply be', as if he has been taking tutorials in spin from Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>The Chief Press Secretary was, a few weeks ago, suggesting that Mr Mandelson had mislaid his marbles. Now, Number 10 tells us that the ex-Minister has emerged 'without a stain on his character'. The Prime Minister declares his friend to be 'a person of immense ability and integrity... with much to give'. Why, then, is there 'no question of him coming back to government'? Why was this pillar of talent and rock of probity pitchforked out of the Cabinet?</p> <p>On the evidence of the report commissioned by the Prime Minister, Mr Mandelson's QC seems to be right that the former Northern Ireland Secretary would have a cast-iron case for unfair dismissal. But this is not justice; it's politics. Moreover, it is high politics of the lowest kind. The real reason he was sacked was beyond the scope of Sir Wally's narrow investigations, and it is simply too embarrassing for the Prime Minister to furnish a candid answer. Peter's friends sacrificed him at the critical moment because, on the evidence placed before Tony Blair during the frantic few hours which sealed his fate, the Prime Minister concluded that he had been deceived. To those most closely involved, it was not the first time they felt they had been misled, with the result that a Mandelsonian scandal was screaming from every media orifice. There were previous convictions, notably Mr Mandelson's failure to fess up to Mr Blair about the Robinson home loan, to be taken into consideration. This builds our knowledge of the workings of the innermost sanctums of the Government in ways which do not invite appealing conclusions. The paranoia, mistrust and hysteria within the Blair court is so pronounced that the Prime Minister rushed to the assumption that one of his oldest friends and closest political allies had to be lying. It is clearer than ever that the decision to terminate Peter Mandelson with extreme prejudice was made in a frenzied panic to meet deadlines imposed by the media. Had they all taken a deep breath, sat it out and waited for the official inquiry, the headlines could hardly have been more damning than the ones they got.</p> <p>Tony Blair is said to harbour deep regrets about the sacking. Not half as bitter, mind you, as the grievances nursed by Mr Mandelson with whom the Prime Minister is now back in regular, secret contact. I very much doubt that this will make one jot of difference to the outcome of the election. I do not see them leafing through annotated copies of the Hammond report in the snug bar of the Swinging Voter and slamming down their pints with the angry cry: 'I was going to put my cross next to Labour. But seeing how disgracefully Tony Blair shafted that Peter Mandelson, I can never vote Labour again.'</p> <p>The aftershock is more to be measured in terms of the complex balance of power within the Government. Mr Blair was a fool to bring his friend back into the Cabinet the second time - or he was a fool when he sacked him the second time. Either way, his reputation for sound judgment is diminished. Labour MPs will draw their own conclusions from his readiness to sacrifice his old and close confidant. They may wonder whether their personal, long-term prospects are best served by aligning themselves with the Prime Minister or whether they should be making their dispositions with the Chancellor that they know is hungry to move next door.</p> <p>As for Peter Mandelson, no one who knows him expects that self-confessed 'exotic' to be content to devote his next 20 years to serving as an obscure Labour backbencher. That is like expecting Madonna to disappear into a nunnery.</p> <p>His unquiet, undead ghost will haunt this government yet. He will be a permanent reminder to Tony Blair - and to Gordon Brown - about the fragility of political friendship. As they march towards their second term without him, he will be a warning to them both that triumph is invariably pregnant with the possibility of nemesis.</p> <p>The rest of us can only gawp in awe and wonderment that people who have made a remarkably good fist of running the country are so abjectly hopeless at governing themselves. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc287/hc287/287.htm\">The Hammond Inquiry: full text</a></p> <p><b>Hammond report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449064,00.html\">Summary of the main points</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/\">Special report: Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449014,00.html\">09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449038,00.html\">09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449071,00.html\">09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449016,00.html\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,448982,00.html\">09.03.2001: Report gives Mandelson no way back</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a><br><br><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0309mandelson.ra\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7ffde\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

Had you told Peter Mandelson that the Government would be cruising to re-election with a double-figure poll lead, even though Tony Blair had not once, but twice, sacked him from the Cabinet, Mr Mandelson would have archly inquired how long you had been a user of hallucinogenic drugs. He would have been calling for a straitjacket before you had a chance to explain how it was that he was completely exonerated by the official inquiry into his second dismissal and yet his great friend, Tony Blair, was still insistent that Peter Mandelson's brilliant career was history. These past four days have exemplified the best and the worst of the last four years. The Budget placed the central accomplishment of this government on self-confident display. The inquiry into the Hinduja affair exposed the chaos and hysteria of New Labour's private life. Gordon Brown personified the assured side of the Government, as his acolytes, chafing in anticipation of the hour when their master supplants Mr Blair as Prime Minister, have not been shy of pointing out. So monumental is his mastery of this moment that the Chancellor could afford to disdain the theatrics traditionally associated with pre-election Budgets. He steamrollered through his disbursements with the \u00e9lan of a man reading from the Treasury phone directory. Where every one of his Labour predecessors ended an invariably brutish and short period in office swamped by financial calamity, charged with betrayal by his party and mistrusted by the electorate, this Labour Chancellor dominates economy, country, and Cabinet. With a magisterially casual sweep of the arm, he announced that the spending Ministers would later fill in the tedious details he had dictated to them, as if the rest of the Cabinet were his Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. The Treasury, in the words of one Blairite, is presently 'rampant' within government. With most of the emphasis on measures to please the heartlands, bar a tax cut worth 69p a week, there were virtually no concessions to the 'new' part of the New Labour coalition. The Chancellor's supporters tend to be rather contemptuous of the Prime Minister's obsession with sweetening Middle Britain. They are reluctant to concede that Tony Blair can sometimes be right. Yet Mr Brown can be too cunning for his own good. His habit of raising revenues by stealth, a scheme, I often think, designed not so much to fool the country as to sneak tax rises past the wary eyes of Number 10, has led him to put up the burden on more than a million middle-earners just before polling day. That was gratuitous and unnecessary from a Chancellor presiding over a surplus in excess of \u00a320 billion. It is not quite right to say that his was not a pre-election Budget. Mr Brown, who looks further ahead than most of us, simply has a different election in mind. He has so arranged things that money will really be pouring into public services by the mid-term of the next parliament, just the moment when he hopes that Mr Blair will honour his promise, if such a pledge truly exists beyond the realms of rumour, to retire in favour of the older man. The Chancellor's power and ambition cause queasiness among those protective of the Prime Minister. They will have gagged at a magazine cover depicting a diminutive Blair perched on the knee of a titanic Brown. Yet his achievements are undeniable even to his detractors. If Gordon Brown is an arrogant man, he has much to be arrogant about. For the first time in more than a century, Labour has successfully married competent stewardship of the economy to social justice. The terms of political trade with the Conservatives have been inverted. Throughout the Eighties and the first half of the Nineties, the Tories used the menace of tax rises to exclude the Left from power. In a total reversal of fortune, now Mr Brown makes the Tory threat to cut his spending on public services the dividing issue, a change which is massively to Labour's advantage. When Labour wins its first proper second term ever, to him will go a massive share of credit. As unrivalled chieftain of the election campaign, he is positioned to attempt to grab all of it. There was a revealing moment during his Budget performance, a moment that illustrated that body language can sometimes speak more eloquently than a thousand words. Finishing his speech to ritual flapping from Labour MPs and a profound cloud of depression over the Tories, the Chancellor sat down to a con gratulatory pat on the left arm from Tony Blair. If the granite sphinx of the Treasury felt it, he did not show it. Acknowledging his neighbour not at all, the Chancellor pursed his lips and continued to stare ahead. Consciously or not, he seemed to want to indicate that he was much too colossal to need the endorsement of the mere Prime Minister. Behind the turbulent couple, amid the sea of happy-clappy faces of Labour MPs, we could just make out the third man. Palely loitering on a distant backbench sat the ghost of Peter Mandelson, spectre at the pre-election feast. He is now, thanks to the Hammond inquiry, if not exactly resurrected, at least raised the ranks of the undead. Sir Anthony Hammond is known to his friends as Wally. I had assumed that this must be a jocular reference to Antipodean antecedents. Having read his report, I'm now inclined to believe that the sobriquet indicates Sir Wally's credulity. Everyone, he tells us, acted out of the best possible motives. Everyone is telling the truth, even when their accounts of the tangled events that led to the Mandelson resignation are palpably contradictory. Our Wally's investigations have not located a smoking gun. There might be a smoking post-it note, but that has been lost. At most, there is a smouldering mango. You can find it, like nearly all of the interesting bits of the Hammond report, buried in the appendix. We learn that the Hinduja brothers showered the former Northern Ireland Secretary with gifts of the exotic fruit. My own inquiries can reveal that Mr Mandelson disposed of these mangoes by presenting them as a substitute for the usual flowers or chocolates to unsuspecting hostesses who had invited him for dinner. Sir Wally concludes that no one is to be blamed for anything. True to the tradition of internal investigations by a civil servant, his conclusions paint everything and everyone in Whitehall magnolia. And yet the report should not be just dismissed as whitewash. Intentionally or not, Sir Wally casts the most unforgiving light on the inner wirings of this Government. We learn, with further and damaging particulars, about New Labour's weakness for rich men of - ahem - fascinating provenance. The Foreign Office warned that 'at the very least, the Hinduja brothers sailed close to the wind in building their business empire' and granting them citizenship could bring 'embarrassment' on Britain. Sir Wally carefully reports that the secret services had gathered 'a certain amount of intelligence', raising the possibility that the Indian billionaires might have been involved in 'dubious practices, in some cases potentially amounting to criminal behaviour'. Mr Mandelson wrote a minute describing the brothers as 'above average risk' and wondering how to 'reduce our exposure to them'. And yet the Hindujas were allowed to draw the Prime Minister, and a startling array of his colleagues, into their orbit. You can see more clearly why Mr Mandelson feels so acutely wronged. His head alone has been stuck on the spike when so many others, notably Keith Vaz, remain in office even though they were entangled with the brothers. In the memo he wrote for the Prime Minister on the evening before the defenestration, the Cabinet Secretary suggested that 'the line should simply be' that 'no one has produced a shred of evidence that anything improper took place'. Observe how Sir Richard Wilson, that august and most senior of civil servants, has become so immersed in New Labour's presentationally driven culture that he writes 'the line should simply be', as if he has been taking tutorials in spin from Alastair Campbell. The Chief Press Secretary was, a few weeks ago, suggesting that Mr Mandelson had mislaid his marbles. Now, Number 10 tells us that the ex-Minister has emerged 'without a stain on his character'. The Prime Minister declares his friend to be 'a person of immense ability and integrity... with much to give'. Why, then, is there 'no question of him coming back to government'? Why was this pillar of talent and rock of probity pitchforked out of the Cabinet? On the evidence of the report commissioned by the Prime Minister, Mr Mandelson's QC seems to be right that the former Northern Ireland Secretary would have a cast-iron case for unfair dismissal. But this is not justice; it's politics. Moreover, it is high politics of the lowest kind. The real reason he was sacked was beyond the scope of Sir Wally's narrow investigations, and it is simply too embarrassing for the Prime Minister to furnish a candid answer. Peter's friends sacrificed him at the critical moment because, on the evidence placed before Tony Blair during the frantic few hours which sealed his fate, the Prime Minister concluded that he had been deceived. To those most closely involved, it was not the first time they felt they had been misled, with the result that a Mandelsonian scandal was screaming from every media orifice. There were previous convictions, notably Mr Mandelson's failure to fess up to Mr Blair about the Robinson home loan, to be taken into consideration. This builds our knowledge of the workings of the innermost sanctums of the Government in ways which do not invite appealing conclusions. The paranoia, mistrust and hysteria within the Blair court is so pronounced that the Prime Minister rushed to the assumption that one of his oldest friends and closest political allies had to be lying. It is clearer than ever that the decision to terminate Peter Mandelson with extreme prejudice was made in a frenzied panic to meet deadlines imposed by the media. Had they all taken a deep breath, sat it out and waited for the official inquiry, the headlines could hardly have been more damning than the ones they got. Tony Blair is said to harbour deep regrets about the sacking. Not half as bitter, mind you, as the grievances nursed by Mr Mandelson with whom the Prime Minister is now back in regular, secret contact. I very much doubt that this will make one jot of difference to the outcome of the election. I do not see them leafing through annotated copies of the Hammond report in the snug bar of the Swinging Voter and slamming down their pints with the angry cry: 'I was going to put my cross next to Labour. But seeing how disgracefully Tony Blair shafted that Peter Mandelson, I can never vote Labour again.' The aftershock is more to be measured in terms of the complex balance of power within the Government. Mr Blair was a fool to bring his friend back into the Cabinet the second time - or he was a fool when he sacked him the second time. Either way, his reputation for sound judgment is diminished. Labour MPs will draw their own conclusions from his readiness to sacrifice his old and close confidant. They may wonder whether their personal, long-term prospects are best served by aligning themselves with the Prime Minister or whether they should be making their dispositions with the Chancellor that they know is hungry to move next door. As for Peter Mandelson, no one who knows him expects that self-confessed 'exotic' to be content to devote his next 20 years to serving as an obscure Labour backbencher. That is like expecting Madonna to disappear into a nunnery. His unquiet, undead ghost will haunt this government yet. He will be a permanent reminder to Tony Blair - and to Gordon Brown - about the fragility of political friendship. As they march towards their second term without him, he will be a warning to them both that triumph is invariably pregnant with the possibility of nemesis. The rest of us can only gawp in awe and wonderment that people who have made a remarkably good fist of running the country are so abjectly hopeless at governing themselves.

And Willetts is now back on the Tory front bench and about to draft the Conservative election manifesto. But he was found guilty only once.

My Birmingham constituents had no more chance of having their citizenship application treated in the Hinduja way than they had of Blair accepting an invitation to one of their parties. And, although, the Prime Minister was right to act decisively in the removal of Mandelson, he must take some responsibility for not changing the Whitehall view that to those who have much, more shall be given. It is hard for him to make the Home Office change its ways with so much rich men's money swilling about Labour.</p> <p>New Labour is right to denounce old-fashioned socialism's antagonism to success. But success is not a virtue. The least we can accept is that, after the election, the Labour will show some discretion in its choice of millionaires.

A series of high-profile peers, thought to include the Government's adviser on health, Lord Winston, and the senior Labour Party figure and multimillionaire, Lord Alli, are expected to speak against an outright ban when the issue is debated in the Lords tomorrow. Baroness Jay, the Leader of the Lords, and Baroness Hayman, the Agriculture Minister, have already said they do not agree with stopping hunting in Britain. The Labour peers will argue that rather than a ban the Government should agree to a 'middle-way' option where hunts are given statutory regulation and are more closely controlled. They have given firm pledges to hunt supporters that they will vote against the ban in the Lords on 26 March. The pro-hunting Countryside Alliance is delighted that so many high-profile Labour members will vote against a ban, saying that it reveals that the issue is not one of Labour versus the Tories.

When the issue was last voted on in the Commons last January, the Prime Minister was absent. Last week John Jackson, the chairman of the alliance, was invited to see Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff and one of the most influential people in the Government, at No 10 where there was discussion of a possible compromise.

      "body": "<p>Peter Mandelson told no lies, attempted no deception and made no overt effort to influence the outcome of the Hinduja brothers' passport application. But he had to go. And no Prime Minister with an instinct for self-preservation will ever bring him back.</p> <p>Technically his crime was nothing like as serious as David Willetts's attempt to deceive a House of Commons select committee. And Willetts is now back on the Tory front bench and about to draft the Conservative election manifesto. But he was found guilty only once. Mandelson has been in a succession of scrapes, and, innocent or not, the pattern of his conduct had become intolerable. He enjoyed living dangerously, and fell off the high wire far too often.</p> <p>Although Mandelson was acquitted of all charges, the report exposes a Whitehall machine which is complacent, incompetent and (in a very gentlemanly fashion) institutionally corrupt. The indictment is not that Ministers and civil servants treated the Hindujas in an exceptional way, nor that they helped them by breaking the rules. The report reveals that the rules which are regularly applied - when compounded by a demeaning reverence for wealth - are a disgrace.</p> <p>Among the working-class black and Asian British, the Home Office is notorious for the unsympathetic way in which it treats run-of-the-mill nationality applications. Yet in 1998 Ministers and civil servants competed with each other to give Strichand Hinduja a swift and easy passage. Shameful, but neither improper nor illegal.</p> <p>It is possible to relax some of the basic citizenship requirements 'in the special circumstances of any particular case'. So Andrew Walmsley, head of the Nationality Directorate, suggested that Rule D - which requires 450 days' residence in the UK during the five years before application - might be waived. Hinduja had been paying British taxes.</p> <p>There is no doubt why Hinduja was treated with such deference. In his note to Ministers, Walmsley emphasised a special attribute which he regarded as worthy of 'consideration' when the application for citizenship was considered: 'The family business empire has a corporate wealth of $6-$8 billion and their personal wealth was estimated in 1991 at \u00a3500m.'</p> <p>That wide-eyed description of the brothers' fortune solves the whole Hinduja riddle. It explains why William Hague was photographed with him, Tony Blair accepted invitations to his parties and Peter Mandelson acted as his messenger boy. Sadly, New Labour, no less than the Tories, is hypnotised by big bank balances. Wealth is regarded as synonymous with virtue and success. The mafia of power and money binds Ministers to men who should not be allowed within a mile of No 10.</p> <p>And the money buys privilege. The Hammond Report is explicit about that. Most people who know how Whitehall works will believe that the Mandelson phone call, whatever its formal purpose, guaranteed Hinduja special consideration. But the evidence proves that he was getting it already. As head of the Nationality Directorate, Walmsley 'tended to deal with high-profile cases himself'. And, partly because of his rank and partly because of his lighter case load, his applications progressed more quickly than those processed by his staff. Ergo, high visibility guaranteed speedy attention. So much for equality before the law.</p> <p>Walmsley has moved on. We should be grateful for that. He was not sure of the exact number of days Strichand Hinduja had spent in the country immediately before his nationality application, and he did not require him to apply again after his first attempt had failed. References, he said, were useless since they were usually complimentary.</p> <p>Not all of them. Caroline Elmes of the Foreign Office wrote to say that: 'At the very least, the Hinduja brothers can be said to sail close to the wind.' When he reported to Ministers, Walmsley put it differently. 'At the time of his earlier application there were doubts about the brothers' ability to meet the requirements to be of good character... These were, however, resolved concerning Mr Gopichand Hinduja's application and there is no reason to believe that Mr Strichand Hinduja would not now meet the requirement.' Tell that to the Indian government which will not let him out of the country.</p> <p>The problem, as so often, is the whole culture. Money talks. My Birmingham constituents had no more chance of having their citizenship application treated in the Hinduja way than they had of Blair accepting an invitation to one of their parties. And, although, the Prime Minister was right to act decisively in the removal of Mandelson, he must take some responsibility for not changing the Whitehall view that to those who have much, more shall be given.

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson told no lies, attempted no deception and made no overt effort to influence the outcome of the Hinduja brothers' passport application. But he had to go. And no Prime Minister with an instinct for self-preservation will ever bring him back. Technically his crime was nothing like as serious as David Willetts's attempt to deceive a House of Commons select committee. And Willetts is now back on the Tory front bench and about to draft the Conservative election manifesto. But he was found guilty only once. Mandelson has been in a succession of scrapes, and, innocent or not, the pattern of his conduct had become intolerable. He enjoyed living dangerously, and fell off the high wire far too often. Although Mandelson was acquitted of all charges, the report exposes a Whitehall machine which is complacent, incompetent and (in a very gentlemanly fashion) institutionally corrupt. The indictment is not that Ministers and civil servants treated the Hindujas in an exceptional way, nor that they helped them by breaking the rules. The report reveals that the rules which are regularly applied - when compounded by a demeaning reverence for wealth - are a disgrace. Among the working-class black and Asian British, the Home Office is notorious for the unsympathetic way in which it treats run-of-the-mill nationality applications. Yet in 1998 Ministers and civil servants competed with each other to give Strichand Hinduja a swift and easy passage. Shameful, but neither improper nor illegal. It is possible to relax some of the basic citizenship requirements 'in the special circumstances of any particular case'. So Andrew Walmsley, head of the Nationality Directorate, suggested that Rule D - which requires 450 days' residence in the UK during the five years before application - might be waived. Hinduja had been paying British taxes. There is no doubt why Hinduja was treated with such deference. In his note to Ministers, Walmsley emphasised a special attribute which he regarded as worthy of 'consideration' when the application for citizenship was considered: 'The family business empire has a corporate wealth of $6-$8 billion and their personal wealth was estimated in 1991 at \u00a3500m.' That wide-eyed description of the brothers' fortune solves the whole Hinduja riddle. It explains why William Hague was photographed with him, Tony Blair accepted invitations to his parties and Peter Mandelson acted as his messenger boy. Sadly, New Labour, no less than the Tories, is hypnotised by big bank balances. Wealth is regarded as synonymous with virtue and success. The mafia of power and money binds Ministers to men who should not be allowed within a mile of No 10. And the money buys privilege. The Hammond Report is explicit about that. Most people who know how Whitehall works will believe that the Mandelson phone call, whatever its formal purpose, guaranteed Hinduja special consideration. But the evidence proves that he was getting it already. As head of the Nationality Directorate, Walmsley 'tended to deal with high-profile cases himself'. And, partly because of his rank and partly because of his lighter case load, his applications progressed more quickly than those processed by his staff. Ergo, high visibility guaranteed speedy attention. So much for equality before the law. Walmsley has moved on. We should be grateful for that. He was not sure of the exact number of days Strichand Hinduja had spent in the country immediately before his nationality application, and he did not require him to apply again after his first attempt had failed. References, he said, were useless since they were usually complimentary. Not all of them. Caroline Elmes of the Foreign Office wrote to say that: 'At the very least, the Hinduja brothers can be said to sail close to the wind.' When he reported to Ministers, Walmsley put it differently. 'At the time of his earlier application there were doubts about the brothers' ability to meet the requirements to be of good character... These were, however, resolved concerning Mr Gopichand Hinduja's application and there is no reason to believe that Mr Strichand Hinduja would not now meet the requirement.' Tell that to the Indian government which will not let him out of the country. The problem, as so often, is the whole culture. Money talks. My Birmingham constituents had no more chance of having their citizenship application treated in the Hinduja way than they had of Blair accepting an invitation to one of their parties. And, although, the Prime Minister was right to act decisively in the removal of Mandelson, he must take some responsibility for not changing the Whitehall view that to those who have much, more shall be given. It is hard for him to make the Home Office change its ways with so much rich men's money swilling about Labour. New Labour is right to denounce old-fashioned socialism's antagonism to success. But success is not a virtue. The least we can accept is that, after the election, the Labour will show some discretion in its choice of millionaires. The Hammond Report proves - almost absentmindedly - the danger of being dazzled by wealth.

Who has not tried Yahoo! as a search engine and internet portal?</p> <p>But last week even the mighty Yahoo! joined the list of dotcom and IT companies either in the graveyard or fatally wounded - and raised fundamental questions about the durability and sustainability of the dotcom revolution.

Yahoo!'s share price once stood at a mighty $220 - now it trades at less than a tenth that. What the American system delivers, it also takes away. Maybe Europeans should be just a little less credulous about the US - and prouder of their own economic and social model. For Yahoo! is not one of the frothier products of the hi-tech boom, it is absolutely at its heart. It has built advertising revenues of some $1 billion a year, and it should be able to make a profit; it is rich in cash and if any IT company can survive the US economic downturn it should be Yahoo!. But its apparent durability has proved illusory.

      "body": "<p>Who would have believed it? Certainly not one of the insecure trio who invented New Labour. Had you told Tony Blair four years ago that the Conservatives would become such an outlandish irrelevance that right-wing newspapers, the natural prejudices of their editors and proprietors outvoted by their readers, would be falling over each other to declare that he had his second term in the bag, Mr Blair would have suggested you should seek help from a psychiatrist.</p> <p>Had you told Gordon Brown that he would be near-universally applauded as Golden Brown, the outstanding Chancellor of modern times, he would have told you he had more important things to do than listen to silly jokes.</p> <p>Had you told Peter Mandelson that the Government would be cruising to re-election with a double-figure poll lead, even though Tony Blair had not once, but twice, sacked him from the Cabinet, Mr Mandelson would have archly inquired how long you had been a user of hallucinogenic drugs. He would have been calling for a straitjacket before you had a chance to explain how it was that he was completely exonerated by the official inquiry into his second dismissal and yet his great friend, Tony Blair, was still insistent that Peter Mandelson's brilliant career was history.</p> <p>These past four days have exemplified the best and the worst of the last four years. The Budget placed the central accomplishment of this government on self-confident display. The inquiry into the Hinduja affair exposed the chaos and hysteria of New Labour's private life.</p> <p>Gordon Brown personified the assured side of the Government, as his acolytes, chafing in anticipation of the hour when their master supplants Mr Blair as Prime Minister, have not been shy of pointing out. So monumental is his mastery of this moment that the Chancellor could afford to disdain the theatrics traditionally associated with pre-election Budgets. He steamrollered through his disbursements with the \u00e9lan of a man reading from the Treasury phone directory. Where every one of his Labour predecessors ended an invariably brutish and short period in office swamped by financial calamity, charged with betrayal by his party and mistrusted by the electorate, this Labour Chancellor dominates economy, country, and Cabinet.</p> <p>With a magisterially casual sweep of the arm, he announced that the spending Ministers would later fill in the tedious details he had dictated to them, as if the rest of the Cabinet were his Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. The Treasury, in the words of one Blairite, is presently 'rampant' within government. With most of the emphasis on measures to please the heartlands, bar a tax cut worth 69p a week, there were virtually no concessions to the 'new' part of the New Labour coalition.</p> <p>The Chancellor's supporters tend to be rather contemptuous of the Prime Minister's obsession with sweetening Middle Britain. They are reluctant to concede that Tony Blair can sometimes be right. Yet Mr Brown can be too cunning for his own good. His habit of raising revenues by stealth, a scheme, I often think, designed not so much to fool the country as to sneak tax rises past the wary eyes of Number 10, has led him to put up the burden on more than a million middle-earners just before polling day. That was gratuitous and unnecessary from a Chancellor presiding over a surplus in excess of \u00a320 billion.</p> <p>It is not quite right to say that his was not a pre-election Budget. Mr Brown, who looks further ahead than most of us, simply has a different election in mind. He has so arranged things that money will really be pouring into public services by the mid-term of the next parliament, just the moment when he hopes that Mr Blair will honour his promise, if such a pledge truly exists beyond the realms of rumour, to retire in favour of the older man.</p> <p>The Chancellor's power and ambition cause queasiness among those protective of the Prime Minister. They will have gagged at a magazine cover depicting a diminutive Blair perched on the knee of a titanic Brown. Yet his achievements are undeniable even to his detractors. If Gordon Brown is an arrogant man, he has much to be arrogant about. For the first time in more than a century, Labour has successfully married competent stewardship of the economy to social justice. The terms of political trade with the Conservatives have been inverted. Throughout the Eighties and the first half of the Nineties, the Tories used the menace of tax rises to exclude the Left from power. In a total reversal of fortune, now Mr Brown makes the Tory threat to cut his spending on public services the dividing issue, a change which is massively to Labour's advantage. When Labour wins its first proper second term ever, to him will go a massive share of credit. As unrivalled chieftain of the election campaign, he is positioned to attempt to grab all of it.</p> <p>There was a revealing moment during his Budget performance, a moment that illustrated that body language can sometimes speak more eloquently than a thousand words. Finishing his speech to ritual flapping from Labour MPs and a profound cloud of depression over the Tories, the Chancellor sat down to a con gratulatory pat on the left arm from Tony Blair. If the granite sphinx of the Treasury felt it, he did not show it. Acknowledging his neighbour not at all, the Chancellor pursed his lips and continued to stare ahead. Consciously or not, he seemed to want to indicate that he was much too colossal to need the endorsement of the mere Prime Minister.</p> <p>Behind the turbulent couple, amid the sea of happy-clappy faces of Labour MPs, we could just make out the third man. Palely loitering on a distant backbench sat the ghost of Peter Mandelson, spectre at the pre-election feast. He is now, thanks to the Hammond inquiry, if not exactly resurrected, at least raised the ranks of the undead.</p> <p>Sir Anthony Hammond is known to his friends as Wally. I had assumed that this must be a jocular reference to Antipodean antecedents. Having read his report, I'm now inclined to believe that the sobriquet indicates Sir Wally's credulity. Everyone, he tells us, acted out of the best possible motives. Everyone is telling the truth, even when their accounts of the tangled events that led to the Mandelson resignation are palpably contradictory.</p> <p>Our Wally's investigations have not located a smoking gun. There might be a smoking post-it note, but that has been lost. At most, there is a smouldering mango. You can find it, like nearly all of the interesting bits of the Hammond report, buried in the appendix. We learn that the Hinduja brothers showered the former Northern Ireland Secretary with gifts of the exotic fruit. My own inquiries can reveal that Mr Mandelson disposed of these mangoes by presenting them as a substitute for the usual flowers or chocolates to unsuspecting hostesses who had invited him for dinner. Sir Wally concludes that no one is to be blamed for anything. True to the tradition of internal investigations by a civil servant, his conclusions paint everything and everyone in Whitehall magnolia.</p> <p>And yet the report should not be just dismissed as whitewash. Intentionally or not, Sir Wally casts the most unforgiving light on the inner wirings of this Government. We learn, with further and damaging particulars, about New Labour's weakness for rich men of - ahem - fascinating provenance. The Foreign Office warned that 'at the very least, the Hinduja brothers sailed close to the wind in building their business empire' and granting them citizenship could bring 'embarrassment' on Britain. Sir Wally carefully reports that the secret services had gathered 'a certain amount of intelligence', raising the possibility that the Indian billionaires might have been involved in 'dubious practices, in some cases potentially amounting to criminal behaviour'. Mr Mandelson wrote a minute describing the brothers as 'above average risk' and wondering how to 'reduce our exposure to them'. And yet the Hindujas were allowed to draw the Prime Minister, and a startling array of his colleagues, into their orbit.</p> <p>You can see more clearly why Mr Mandelson feels so acutely wronged. His head alone has been stuck on the spike when so many others, notably Keith Vaz, remain in office even though they were entangled with the brothers. In the memo he wrote for the Prime Minister on the evening before the defenestration, the Cabinet Secretary suggested that 'the line should simply be' that 'no one has produced a shred of evidence that anything improper took place'. Observe how Sir Richard Wilson, that august and most senior of civil servants, has become so immersed in New Labour's presentationally driven culture that he writes 'the line should simply be', as if he has been taking tutorials in spin from Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>The Chief Press Secretary was, a few weeks ago, suggesting that Mr Mandelson had mislaid his marbles. Now, Number 10 tells us that the ex-Minister has emerged 'without a stain on his character'. The Prime Minister declares his friend to be 'a person of immense ability and integrity... with much to give'. Why, then, is there 'no question of him coming back to government'? Why was this pillar of talent and rock of probity pitchforked out of the Cabinet?</p> <p>On the evidence of the report commissioned by the Prime Minister, Mr Mandelson's QC seems to be right that the former Northern Ireland Secretary would have a cast-iron case for unfair dismissal. But this is not justice; it's politics. Moreover, it is high politics of the lowest kind. The real reason he was sacked was beyond the scope of Sir Wally's narrow investigations, and it is simply too embarrassing for the Prime Minister to furnish a candid answer. Peter's friends sacrificed him at the critical moment because, on the evidence placed before Tony Blair during the frantic few hours which sealed his fate, the Prime Minister concluded that he had been deceived. To those most closely involved, it was not the first time they felt they had been misled, with the result that a Mandelsonian scandal was screaming from every media orifice. There were previous convictions, notably Mr Mandelson's failure to fess up to Mr Blair about the Robinson home loan, to be taken into consideration. This builds our knowledge of the workings of the innermost sanctums of the Government in ways which do not invite appealing conclusions. The paranoia, mistrust and hysteria within the Blair court is so pronounced that the Prime Minister rushed to the assumption that one of his oldest friends and closest political allies had to be lying. It is clearer than ever that the decision to terminate Peter Mandelson with extreme prejudice was made in a frenzied panic to meet deadlines imposed by the media. Had they all taken a deep breath, sat it out and waited for the official inquiry, the headlines could hardly have been more damning than the ones they got.</p> <p>Tony Blair is said to harbour deep regrets about the sacking. Not half as bitter, mind you, as the grievances nursed by Mr Mandelson with whom the Prime Minister is now back in regular, secret contact. I very much doubt that this will make one jot of difference to the outcome of the election. I do not see them leafing through annotated copies of the Hammond report in the snug bar of the Swinging Voter and slamming down their pints with the angry cry: 'I was going to put my cross next to Labour. But seeing how disgracefully Tony Blair shafted that Peter Mandelson, I can never vote Labour again.'</p> <p>The aftershock is more to be measured in terms of the complex balance of power within the Government. Mr Blair was a fool to bring his friend back into the Cabinet the second time - or he was a fool when he sacked him the second time. Either way, his reputation for sound judgment is diminished. Labour MPs will draw their own conclusions from his readiness to sacrifice his old and close confidant. They may wonder whether their personal, long-term prospects are best served by aligning themselves with the Prime Minister or whether they should be making their dispositions with the Chancellor that they know is hungry to move next door.</p> <p>As for Peter Mandelson, no one who knows him expects that self-confessed 'exotic' to be content to devote his next 20 years to serving as an obscure Labour backbencher. That is like expecting Madonna to disappear into a nunnery.</p> <p>His unquiet, undead ghost will haunt this government yet. He will be a permanent reminder to Tony Blair - and to Gordon Brown - about the fragility of political friendship. As they march towards their second term without him, he will be a warning to them both that triumph is invariably pregnant with the possibility of nemesis.</p> <p>The rest of us can only gawp in awe and wonderment that people who have made a remarkably good fist of running the country are so abjectly hopeless at governing themselves. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc287/hc287/287.htm\">The Hammond Inquiry: full text</a></p> <p><b>Hammond report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449064,00.html\">Summary of the main points</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/\">Special report: Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449014,00.html\">09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449038,00.html\">09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449071,00.html\">09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449016,00.html\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,448982,00.html\">09.03.2001: Report gives Mandelson no way back</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a><br><br><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0309mandelson.ra\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7ffde\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

That was gratuitous and unnecessary from a Chancellor presiding over a surplus in excess of \u00a320 billion. It is not quite right to say that his was not a pre-election Budget. Mr Brown, who looks further ahead than most of us, simply has a different election in mind. He has so arranged things that money will really be pouring into public services by the mid-term of the next parliament, just the moment when he hopes that Mr Blair will honour his promise, if such a pledge truly exists beyond the realms of rumour, to retire in favour of the older man. The Chancellor's power and ambition cause queasiness among those protective of the Prime Minister. They will have gagged at a magazine cover depicting a diminutive Blair perched on the knee of a titanic Brown. Yet his achievements are undeniable even to his detractors. If Gordon Brown is an arrogant man, he has much to be arrogant about. For the first time in more than a century, Labour has successfully married competent stewardship of the economy to social justice. The terms of political trade with the Conservatives have been inverted. Throughout the Eighties and the first half of the Nineties, the Tories used the menace of tax rises to exclude the Left from power. In a total reversal of fortune, now Mr Brown makes the Tory threat to cut his spending on public services the dividing issue, a change which is massively to Labour's advantage. When Labour wins its first proper second term ever, to him will go a massive share of credit. As unrivalled chieftain of the election campaign, he is positioned to attempt to grab all of it. There was a revealing moment during his Budget performance, a moment that illustrated that body language can sometimes speak more eloquently than a thousand words. Finishing his speech to ritual flapping from Labour MPs and a profound cloud of depression over the Tories, the Chancellor sat down to a con gratulatory pat on the left arm from Tony Blair. If the granite sphinx of the Treasury felt it, he did not show it. Acknowledging his neighbour not at all, the Chancellor pursed his lips and continued to stare ahead. Consciously or not, he seemed to want to indicate that he was much too colossal to need the endorsement of the mere Prime Minister. Behind the turbulent couple, amid the sea of happy-clappy faces of Labour MPs, we could just make out the third man. Palely loitering on a distant backbench sat the ghost of Peter Mandelson, spectre at the pre-election feast. He is now, thanks to the Hammond inquiry, if not exactly resurrected, at least raised the ranks of the undead. Sir Anthony Hammond is known to his friends as Wally. I had assumed that this must be a jocular reference to Antipodean antecedents. Having read his report, I'm now inclined to believe that the sobriquet indicates Sir Wally's credulity. Everyone, he tells us, acted out of the best possible motives. Everyone is telling the truth, even when their accounts of the tangled events that led to the Mandelson resignation are palpably contradictory. Our Wally's investigations have not located a smoking gun. There might be a smoking post-it note, but that has been lost. At most, there is a smouldering mango. You can find it, like nearly all of the interesting bits of the Hammond report, buried in the appendix. We learn that the Hinduja brothers showered the former Northern Ireland Secretary with gifts of the exotic fruit. My own inquiries can reveal that Mr Mandelson disposed of these mangoes by presenting them as a substitute for the usual flowers or chocolates to unsuspecting hostesses who had invited him for dinner. Sir Wally concludes that no one is to be blamed for anything. True to the tradition of internal investigations by a civil servant, his conclusions paint everything and everyone in Whitehall magnolia. And yet the report should not be just dismissed as whitewash. Intentionally or not, Sir Wally casts the most unforgiving light on the inner wirings of this Government. We learn, with further and damaging particulars, about New Labour's weakness for rich men of - ahem - fascinating provenance. The Foreign Office warned that 'at the very least, the Hinduja brothers sailed close to the wind in building their business empire' and granting them citizenship could bring 'embarrassment' on Britain. Sir Wally carefully reports that the secret services had gathered 'a certain amount of intelligence', raising the possibility that the Indian billionaires might have been involved in 'dubious practices, in some cases potentially amounting to criminal behaviour'. Mr Mandelson wrote a minute describing the brothers as 'above average risk' and wondering how to 'reduce our exposure to them'. And yet the Hindujas were allowed to draw the Prime Minister, and a startling array of his colleagues, into their orbit. You can see more clearly why Mr Mandelson feels so acutely wronged. His head alone has been stuck on the spike when so many others, notably Keith Vaz, remain in office even though they were entangled with the brothers. In the memo he wrote for the Prime Minister on the evening before the defenestration, the Cabinet Secretary suggested that 'the line should simply be' that 'no one has produced a shred of evidence that anything improper took place'. Observe how Sir Richard Wilson, that august and most senior of civil servants, has become so immersed in New Labour's presentationally driven culture that he writes 'the line should simply be', as if he has been taking tutorials in spin from Alastair Campbell. The Chief Press Secretary was, a few weeks ago, suggesting that Mr Mandelson had mislaid his marbles. Now, Number 10 tells us that the ex-Minister has emerged 'without a stain on his character'. The Prime Minister declares his friend to be 'a person of immense ability and integrity... with much to give'. Why, then, is there 'no question of him coming back to government'? Why was this pillar of talent and rock of probity pitchforked out of the Cabinet? On the evidence of the report commissioned by the Prime Minister, Mr Mandelson's QC seems to be right that the former Northern Ireland Secretary would have a cast-iron case for unfair dismissal. But this is not justice; it's politics. Moreover, it is high politics of the lowest kind. The real reason he was sacked was beyond the scope of Sir Wally's narrow investigations, and it is simply too embarrassing for the Prime Minister to furnish a candid answer. Peter's friends sacrificed him at the critical moment because, on the evidence placed before Tony Blair during the frantic few hours which sealed his fate, the Prime Minister concluded that he had been deceived. To those most closely involved, it was not the first time they felt they had been misled, with the result that a Mandelsonian scandal was screaming from every media orifice. There were previous convictions, notably Mr Mandelson's failure to fess up to Mr Blair about the Robinson home loan, to be taken into consideration. This builds our knowledge of the workings of the innermost sanctums of the Government in ways which do not invite appealing conclusions. The paranoia, mistrust and hysteria within the Blair court is so pronounced that the Prime Minister rushed to the assumption that one of his oldest friends and closest political allies had to be lying. It is clearer than ever that the decision to terminate Peter Mandelson with extreme prejudice was made in a frenzied panic to meet deadlines imposed by the media. Had they all taken a deep breath, sat it out and waited for the official inquiry, the headlines could hardly have been more damning than the ones they got. Tony Blair is said to harbour deep regrets about the sacking. Not half as bitter, mind you, as the grievances nursed by Mr Mandelson with whom the Prime Minister is now back in regular, secret contact. I very much doubt that this will make one jot of difference to the outcome of the election. I do not see them leafing through annotated copies of the Hammond report in the snug bar of the Swinging Voter and slamming down their pints with the angry cry: 'I was going to put my cross next to Labour. But seeing how disgracefully Tony Blair shafted that Peter Mandelson, I can never vote Labour again.' The aftershock is more to be measured in terms of the complex balance of power within the Government. Mr Blair was a fool to bring his friend back into the Cabinet the second time - or he was a fool when he sacked him the second time. Either way, his reputation for sound judgment is diminished. Labour MPs will draw their own conclusions from his readiness to sacrifice his old and close confidant. They may wonder whether their personal, long-term prospects are best served by aligning themselves with the Prime Minister or whether they should be making their dispositions with the Chancellor that they know is hungry to move next door. As for Peter Mandelson, no one who knows him expects that self-confessed 'exotic' to be content to devote his next 20 years to serving as an obscure Labour backbencher. That is like expecting Madonna to disappear into a nunnery. His unquiet, undead ghost will haunt this government yet. He will be a permanent reminder to Tony Blair - and to Gordon Brown - about the fragility of political friendship. As they march towards their second term without him, he will be a warning to them both that triumph is invariably pregnant with the possibility of nemesis. The rest of us can only gawp in awe and wonderment that people who have made a remarkably good fist of running the country are so abjectly hopeless at governing themselves.

      "bodyText": "More than 70 Labour peers are set to vote against an outright ban on fox hunting, effectively sinking Tony Blair's personal pledge that the sport would be made illegal under a Labour Government. A series of high-profile peers, thought to include the Government's adviser on health, Lord Winston, and the senior Labour Party figure and multimillionaire, Lord Alli, are expected to speak against an outright ban when the issue is debated in the Lords tomorrow. Baroness Jay, the Leader of the Lords, and Baroness Hayman, the Agriculture Minister, have already said they do not agree with stopping hunting in Britain. The Labour peers will argue that rather than a ban the Government should agree to a 'middle-way' option where hunts are given statutory regulation and are more closely controlled. They have given firm pledges to hunt supporters that they will vote against the ban in the Lords on 26 March. The pro-hunting Countryside Alliance is delighted that so many high-profile Labour members will vote against a ban, saying that it reveals that the issue is not one of Labour versus the Tories. The strength of Labour feeling against the ban is also expected to strengthen calls within Downing Street that Blair should compromise on the issue. The peers will join Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, the Education Secretary, Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, and John Reid, the Northern Ireland Secretary, who all support the middle-way option. The alliance said that it was important that 'modern- thinking' peers such as Alli and the broadcaster, Lord Bragg, were standing up and saying that the Government was wrong. The Lords debate is expected to give the strongest indication yet that Blair's desire to ban hunting is running into the sand. More than 80 peers have said they want to speak during the debate, with the vast majority taking up positions against a ban. Although the Bill has little chance of becoming law before the general election - and no chance if the general election is held as expected on 3 May - the peers' actions will give a boost to the pro-hunting lobby, which is seeking to persuade the Prime Minister to drop the pledge from the party manifesto. Senior party sources said that such a move was unlikely, as it would anger many backbenchers. 'I think what will happen will be that the direct link between having a free vote and banning hunting will not be made so strongly,' said one backbench MP.

'Actually what we are saying is that we will allow a free vote for all Members of Parliament. It is up to them to decide. As a party we don't actually have to have an opinion on it. So there will far fewer pictures of foxes this time around.' There are increasing signs that Blair wants to find a way to neutralise the issue. Although he said during a BBC Question Time programme in 1999 that he still agreed with a ban, some Downing Street officials are concerned that the Government is setting up an unnecessary confrontation with country interests. When the issue was last voted on in the Commons last January, the Prime Minister was absent. Last week John Jackson, the chairman of the alliance, was invited to see Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff and one of the most influential people in the Government, at No 10 where there was discussion of a possible compromise. Although Richard Burge, the chief executive of the alliance, ruled out any softening of the alliance's position on only agreeing to voluntary regulation, he admitted that there would have to be discussions on any proposals that were put on the table 'in the fullness of time'.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair believes the loss of Peter Mandelson has been a severe blow to the Government and left him isolated in a Cabinet dominated by Chancellor Gordon Brown.</p> <p>The Prime Minister has told colleagues that without one of his oldest political friends he feels the Blairite wing in the Government could suffer and he regrets having had to sack the former Northern Ireland Secretary, according to sources close to Mandelson.</p> <p>In comments that will revive speculation about ten sions between the Blair and Brown camps, friends of the Prime Minister say that he feels exposed and that 'Gordon is rampant'.</p> <p>Although Downing Street sources insisted that Blair, if presented with the same facts on the Hinduja passport affair, would act in the same way again, they admit that the loss of Mandelson has produced a 'big hole' in the Prime Minister's political life.</p> <p>Blair and Mandelson are now in regular telephone contact, revealing the importance that Blair still places on the man he once thanked for masterminding his campaign to become Labour leader.</p> <p>'The relationship is much the same as it was before all this happened,' said one senior party source. In addition, relations between Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, Blair's official spokesman, were described as warm, despite allegations that Campbell had been feuding with the ex-Minister.</p> <p>The fact that Mandelson has been so readily rehabilitated into Blair's inner circle will alarm many in the Government who thought that the former Minister misjudged the seriousness of the passports issue which led to his resignation six weeks ago. Many in the party, some of them enemies of Mandelson, were predicting that he would be cast into the political wilderness and that Blair would turn his back on him. But the Prime Minister is now expected to use Mandelson as a sounding board on issues such as Northern Ireland, Europe and the general election. He specifically refused to say what he felt about Mandelson's resignation when asked about the crisis on Friday after the publication of the Hammond inquiry report which cleared Mandelson of any impropriety over the Hinduja passport applications. Last week the ex-Minister admitted adding to the 'muddle' over the issue, and said he would not seek a return to government.</p> <p>The revelations come as the Prime Minister faces increasing pressure to reveal whether he saw intelligence documents suggesting the Hindujas 'had been involved in a number of dubious practices, in some cases potentially amounting to illegal activities'.</p> <p>The Hammond report confirms that while Trade Secretary and in charge of the Dome, Mandelson was shown security briefings but decided to accept Hinduja funds for the Dome's faith zone.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair believes the loss of Peter Mandelson has been a severe blow to the Government and left him isolated in a Cabinet dominated by Chancellor Gordon Brown. The Prime Minister has told colleagues that without one of his oldest political friends he feels the Blairite wing in the Government could suffer and he regrets having had to sack the former Northern Ireland Secretary, according to sources close to Mandelson. In comments that will revive speculation about ten sions between the Blair and Brown camps, friends of the Prime Minister say that he feels exposed and that 'Gordon is rampant'. Although Downing Street sources insisted that Blair, if presented with the same facts on the Hinduja passport affair, would act in the same way again, they admit that the loss of Mandelson has produced a 'big hole' in the Prime Minister's political life. Blair and Mandelson are now in regular telephone contact, revealing the importance that Blair still places on the man he once thanked for masterminding his campaign to become Labour leader. 'The relationship is much the same as it was before all this happened,' said one senior party source. In addition, relations between Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, Blair's official spokesman, were described as warm, despite allegations that Campbell had been feuding with the ex-Minister. The fact that Mandelson has been so readily rehabilitated into Blair's inner circle will alarm many in the Government who thought that the former Minister misjudged the seriousness of the passports issue which led to his resignation six weeks ago. Many in the party, some of them enemies of Mandelson, were predicting that he would be cast into the political wilderness and that Blair would turn his back on him. But the Prime Minister is now expected to use Mandelson as a sounding board on issues such as Northern Ireland, Europe and the general election. He specifically refused to say what he felt about Mandelson's resignation when asked about the crisis on Friday after the publication of the Hammond inquiry report which cleared Mandelson of any impropriety over the Hinduja passport applications. Last week the ex-Minister admitted adding to the 'muddle' over the issue, and said he would not seek a return to government. The revelations come as the Prime Minister faces increasing pressure to reveal whether he saw intelligence documents suggesting the Hindujas 'had been involved in a number of dubious practices, in some cases potentially amounting to illegal activities'. The Hammond report confirms that while Trade Secretary and in charge of the Dome, Mandelson was shown security briefings but decided to accept Hinduja funds for the Dome's faith zone. If Blair had seen the reports it would have been before Blair and his wife, Cherie, attended a Diwali party thrown by the brothers. The intelligence material emerged after Jen nie Page, then chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company, sought a thorough check on the Indian-born businessmen. One intelligence expert told The Observer that with a project as sensitive as the Dome it would be 'inconceivable' that intelligence briefings on controversial businessman such as the Hindujas had not reached Downing Street. It has also emerged that in the Nineties the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, and her Home Secretary, David Waddington, were advised by officials to stay away from the Hindujas' Diwali party because of fears that it would lead to embarrassment. Ann Widdecombe, Shadow Home Secretary, said: 'The Prime Minister must tell whether he or any of staff were aware of intelligence material on the Hindujas, and if so why did he continue to do business with them?' Opposition MPs are calling on Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, to answer a number of questions emerging from the Hammond inquiry, particularly the role he played in helping the third Hinduja brother, Prakash, last May. A minute reveals that Straw wanted the case to be dealt with 'helpfully'. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker, whose parliamentary question originally helped tease out ministerial involvement in the passport applications, said this weekend that the Home Secretary 'must explain why he was willing do such favours'.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was fighting a fresh sleaze row last night over a leaked memo suggesting Downing Street intervened in a planning application by billionaire arms broker Wafic Said. The Syrian-born tycoon had been locked in a lengthy and highly controversial dispute over the building of a business school in his name in Oxford. The note from a planning official dealing with the case complains of coming 'under pressure from the Prime Minister's office not to delay the decision' over the project, which was to be set up in a listed building. The row hits close to home because Sir Charles Powell, brother of Blair's chief of staff Jonathan, is chair of the school's trustees and a director of several Said companies. Said is also a friend of Peter Mandelson: they have a mutual friend in Powell's wife Carla. But last night Downing Street hit back, insisting it had played no part in the actual decision over whether the business school could go ahead. Officials had only been in touch with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to check when the announcement was being made because it was potentially newsworthy, sources insisted, dismissing the allegations as 'ridiculous' and based on innuendo. 'The facts are that neither the Prime Minister, nor any of his officials had anything to do with the decision. The only involvement of Number 10 was an enquiry about the timing of the announcement of the decision after that decision had already been taken,' said one Downing Street source. But opposition MPs are bound to exploit the affair to ask fresh questions about Labour's relationship with its rich friends. It comes just as Blair was hoping to put the whiff of sleaze behind him after the Hammond inquiry into the obtaining of passports by the millionaire Hinduja brothers cleared Ministers of any impropriety. Said is no stranger to controversy: he helped broker the \u00a320 billion al Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, and was famously a guest in the Ritz hotel in Paris the same weekend as Jonathan Aitken's fateful stay. The memo from south-east regional planning official Avis Gerry to planning Minister Nick Raynsford, dating back to October 1998, responds to complaints from local Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris that he was not given formal notification of the decision going through as is normal procedure. 'This was because we were under pressure from the Prime Minister's office not to delay the decision, and exceptionally we issued it and phoned the MP's office before sending draft letters to the MPs,' it adds. It suggests the excuse that should be given to Harris is the 'sheer volume of correspondence in Ministers' offices' but adds: 'Feel free to change this as appropriate.' Raynsford later wrote to Harris apologising, saying that he was unable to sign correspondence at the time as he was abroad on government business. Last night Harris demanded an explanation. 'The Prime Minister's involvement means this is either control freakery taken to the extreme, a sudden interest in old railway buildings or something more suspicious,' he added. 'There must be a full explanation of why the Prime Minister's office was involved.' Said has donated \u00a320 million to build the business school but the project has been fraught with difficulty. Its original site on the playing field in central Oxford was rejected and the decision to build it near the old railway station, threatening a Victorian building, has provoked local controversy.

I love the way it sticks out into the Atlantic and makes you feel you're not in England. When I can't sleep because of worries about work, money, or other trivia, I imagine myself floating in the blue Cornish water, without any cares beyond what to have for lunch. It usually does the trick. </p> <p>My fianc\u00e9 is a keen surfer so when we were looking for somewhere to get married last year Cornwall was the obvious choice. Our ideal venue was a beautiful old building, with a marriage licence, near a surfing beach. After the law change in 1994, there are now more than 3,000 premises licensed for civil weddings in England and Wales (none in Scotland or Northern Ireland) from castles to the London Eye. About 23 per cent of the 162,000 couples who opted for a civil wedding last year made their vows somewhere other than a Register Office and more than 30,000 couples married abroad. So combining travel and weddings is no longer confined to honeymoons or even to the bridal couple. Whole wedding parties are travelling around the country. </p> <p>We imagined that one of the 3,000 venues might satisfy our requirements, but had no idea how to find it. Salvation came through a website called confetti.co.uk. The site is a symphony of pastel colours and cute drawings designed to help couples plan their wedding. Last year, confetti incorporated a venue-finding service and it came up with a couple of pages of options for us. Nestling between a Best Western hotel and a disused convent on Cornwall's south coast was an old fort, with a marriage licence, next to a surfing beach. </p> <p>'Cornwall? Excellent,' said the first friend we told. 'Oh, lovely!' added my mum. Nobody, it seemed, minded travelling. Sadly, the fort was hot property and fully booked all year, forcing us to snap up a date for this summer. Apparently, everybody wants to get married where the beaches are sandy, the water is clear, and the surfers look like shiny black seals in the sea. A brief trawl through the confetti site today suggests that the venue finding service has been scaled down. All I was able to do now was to ask for Cornwall and a civil venue and I was given 10 pages to trawl. I did revisit the message board to look up 'Hiring candlesticks', 'wedding insurance?' and that perennial 'Brighton hen night - where to go?' </p> <p>When we visited the fort, we found it was everything we had been seeking. The headland was shrouded in fog so thick that we missed the turning several times, but the building was perfect, with high ceilings, a lawn and spectacular sea views. Furthermore, it was staffed by friendly and professional women who, although they do this every week, appeared genuinely excited for us. </p> <p>With their help, I have discovered that it's surprisingly easy to organise a Cornish wedding from Brighton. In fact, it has been almost bizarrely easy to find a local photographer, caterers, a string quartet and a florist. The nice women sent detailed instructions and phone numbers for everyone we might like to contact. With a few trips to the area, we think we now have everything in place for the summer. </p> <p>There's one thing I hadn't imagined for the honeymoon, though: lots of friends joining us on the beach.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.polhawn-fort.co.uk\">www.polhawn-fort.co.uk</a></p>",

But here's the twist: he's a member of staff. In Teachers, a new Channel 4 series, the format of the school drama is thrown up in the air. This is a very different beast to Jimmy McGovern's Hearts and Minds, where teachers were forever discussing government education policy during morning break, or Lucy Gannon's Hope and Glory, where staff hit the bottle and, occasionally, pupils. In Teachers, as in This Life, North Square and Attachments, the professional setting informs, rather than dictates, what happens to the characters. The school is an excuse for the drama, rather than its point, and at a time when Labour's attitude to state education is a hot political topic, Teachers seems almost wilfully unaware of the issues. </p> <p>'The series is open to so much abuse because of the subject matter,' says Andrew Lincoln, who sprang to fame as Egg in This Life, and now has a lead role in Teachers as Simon. 'It'll be a target: people will say it's irresponsible TV. But you've got to see it for what it is, a lighthearted look at the lives of a few people. It's just about gags, basically.' </p> <p>He's right. And they're great. There are overtones of David Lodge here, and of Lucky Jim: The feckless, ambivalent protagonist finds himself trapped in an institution and has to puzzle his way through it, without much common sense to help him along. With its genial teens and profound lack of interest in Ofsted reports, paperwork and underfunding, Teachers may be pure escapism, but the writing is pin-sharp, the direction often touched with genius, and the show is further distinguished by a breezy lack of sentimentality. </p> <p>Since sentimentality tends to be as intrinsic to the genre as chalk and bad food, the three writers (Tim Loane, Julie Rutterford and Andrew Rattenbury) have done well in avoiding the usual scenes of fat kids being bullied or broken spectacles on the gymnasium floor. The students aren't the ones having the problems in this show: instead, they're all reserved for Simon, an English teacher fresh out of training college who is having difficulties adapting to his sudden elevation into a position of responsibility. At 27, he is a very reluctant adult indeed. </p> <p>'I never, ever thought of anyone else for the part,' says Jane Fallon, executive producer, who first worked with Lincoln on This Life. 'We didn't talk to anyone else, we just went straight to Andy, and luckily he was able to do it. Simon, on paper, could be very irritating. We needed someone who could make him more than that, who could make him boyish, charming and funny, and I knew Andy could do it.' </p> <p>Lincoln liked the idea as soon as Fallon approached him, but he was anxious about how it might come across, so he asked his older brother to have a look at the script. His brother, who teaches RE and philosophy at a school in Surrey, loved it. 'If he'd thought it was offensive, taking the piss, I wouldn't have done it. But he read it and said it was just a laugh. He said, \"Oh do it, it's great, it's not saying anything about the school system!\" The school isn't a real school: it's a heightened, trippy, dreamy, oddball place.' </p> <p>No kidding. In the world of Summerdown comprehensive, bells and rules no longer count. Simon, who would rather be seen as a dude than a beak, gets stoned with his pupils, is humiliated when a new girlfriend turns out to be a copper, and hands out textbooks in the pub in order to get his essays marked in time. There's a lot of editorial skittishness, narrative detours into fantasy sequences and imaginary outcomes, as pioneered in Dream On and finessed in Ally McBeal; but the whimsy count is thankfully low. Much of this boils down to Lincoln's ability to play a character whom you warm to, against your better judgment. Lincoln describes Simon as 'a jerk, frankly. He's Woody Allenesque: self-obsessed, juvenile, refusing to grow up. He's so neurotic, and yet charming at the same time'. </p> <p>One might assume that by the end of the series, Simon has wised up a little, but Lincoln, who is optioned for a second series, assures me this is not the case. </p> <p>'He doesn't! That's my dilemma. But then again, how many people do evolve? How long does it take someone to get out of adolescence? Some people never leave it. But it is a key question, where would the second series go?' </p> <p>When a character central to a TV drama refuses to grow or learn, audiences tend to get restless. The recent slump of interest in Ally McBeal is a case in point: what was initially novel and engaging soon turns deathly dull, and not even a broadening of focus, taking in Ally's agonisingly wacky co-workers, can get that show on the road again. </p> <p>But the omens for Teachers are more promising because Simon is surrounded by colleagues - wry confidante Susan; twin geeks Brian and Kurt; and Jenny, his icy nemesis - who might shine if allowed a more prominent role. </p> <p>'I think the other characters need to be developed more,' agrees Lincoln. 'That needs to happen, otherwise people may get bored.' But for now, at least, boredom is not on the curriculum.

However, she said that she had some fundamental disagreements with Paranoid Parenting : 'He concludes that governments should not get involved, but I cannot think of a more appropriate issue for policy than children's issues.' </p> <p>Furedi is no stranger to controversy. He was a prominent member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, a Trotskyite group whose members founded the magazine Living Marxism or LM . The magazine was forced to close last year after it lost a libel case against ITN, which it had accused of doctoring footage of Serb concentration camps. LM was one of the few British publications sympathetic to the Serb cause. </p> <p>In his new book, Furedi argues children are introduced to the culture of fear from the moment they are born. This begins with new measures to guard against hospital babynappers and is followed by guidelines about the minimal risk of cot death. Arriving home, they are surrounded by an army of midwives, health visitors and doctors. They then hem themselves in even more by buying childcare books. As their babies grow, their insecurity makes them easy prey for manufacturers. </p> <p>Furedi is also concerned about the mixed messages in the news. One day a national charity will be castigating parents for turning their children into couch potatoes; the next, he argues, it will announce that letting children play outdoors on their own is a form of child abuse. </p> <p>Add to this fears about accidents in the home and paedophiles, and it's small wonder many parents are inclined to be overprotective, says Furedi. Fear of abuse means no one dares to watch over children who are outside without their adult 'owners'. But in watching their backs, they are undermining what Furedi calls 'adult solidarity'. The casual neighbourhood safety net has disappeared, leaving children who do venture beyond their front doors far less protected than they were before. The author also attacks Dr Jane Healy, a childcare specialist who received publicity last year for telling a parenting conference that young children should not be put in front of computers because this changed the way their brains were wired. Supporters of Healy have said her argument was misrepresented in media scare stories that followed. They say that her central argument was that parents need not think they have to buy all the latest educational gizmos, as research showed the children learnt more when parents put their child on their knee and read them a storybook - a position not dissimilar to Furedi's. </p> <p>According to Paranoid Parenting , it is cruel to keep children inside. They need room to explore the world around them, they need time to make their own friendships in their own way without an army of anxious adults monitoring their every movement. </p> <p>But at the heart of the Furedi argument is an attack on government interference and in particular Labour's social policy: 'The politicisation of parenthood is a failure of the political imagination. Unable to work out effective social policies that can tackle the real problems facing British society, some politicians have been persuaded that if they can re-educate parents everything would turn out fine. Politicians, who have failed to provide Britain with a decent system of education, somehow assume that nevertheless they are fit to educate parents.' </p> <p>Furedi told The Observer that he hopes the book will help parents put their anxieties in perspective, and understand that 'most of the really big issues that plague parents have little to do with problems instrinsic to child-rearing'. He believes they should turn their backs on experts and build on their own experiences. Rather than seek support from professionals in all matters, he'd like parents to pay more attention to friends and relatives familiar with their way of life. </p> <p>Critics of Furedi, such as Guardian columnist Catherine Bennett, argue that he is simply giving parents more to worry about. Writing last week, Bennett quoted Furedi's concern that playground areas are now covered with rubber to limit the damage when a child falls. 'Should they, perhaps be constructed from something more challenging: shards of broken glass, say, or the traditional grit which was once so successful at lacerating young knees?'</p>",

A laid-back and lavishly gifted teenager gliding through his first full season in the high life, absorbing his 'frightening' progress as a West Ham regular and new addition to the England squad is more than enough to be getting along with. </p> <p>But when he does sit down for a moment to imagine just what may happen to his club if the EU and Fifa proposals are in place for next season, he doesn't like what he sees. It's not beyond the realms of possibility that he could come back from his summer holidays to find any number of West Ham's most coveted talents, Paolo Di Canio, Freddie Kanout\u00e9, Joe Cole et al - and even Carrick himself - tempted by tantalisingly fat contracts elsewhere. </p> <p>Maturing beautifully at a club where he feels secure and comfortable, around players he sees as mates and inspirations, the thought that all of a sudden no one will know whether they (or anyone else) are coming or going is not Carrick's idea of football. 'Weird' is the word that springs to his 19-year-old mind. 'It's good for the players in the money sense but in the footballing sense we'll be all over the place,' he laments. 'Without stability you don't know where you are. If you chop and change that quickly you won't know who you are playing with in the end. Team spirit and camaraderie are massively important to me. You've got to look out for each other. That's one of the strengths of me, Lamps [Frank Lampard] and Joe [Cole]. We all look out for each other on the pitch and if somebody is having a bad time we try to help out and gee each other along.' </p> <p>The blossoming rapport between this homegrown midfield trio has been a highlight of West Ham's season. Carrick may be least heralded, considering Lampard is three years his senior and Cole was earmarked for greatness before his voice had broken, but those in the know believe that the lean and elegant Geordie is destined to shine the brightest of them all. His perception, in the way he seems to instinctively know where ball, players and movement are headed at all times, reminds more than a few Hammers of Bobby Moore. </p> <p>And Joe Cole thought he had a lot to live up to... With the voyeurs gawking at Upton Park to see if Cole really was the new Gazza, Carrick is grateful that he was able to emerge more naturally. You sense the greatest expectation he feels comes from within. 'Sustaining high standards week in week out is the hardest thing,' he notes. His eagerness to learn holds him in good stead, and he owes a great deal of that learning to the age-defying leader who talks him through life on and off the field, Stuart Pearce. Carrick can't disguise his amazement for a man who cares so much 'he wants to fight you if you've done something wrong'. It's an approach which is rubbing off. 'When a 39-year-old has the attitude to come in and train like he does, it spurs you on. I don't know how he does it considering he's got a Zimmer-frame coming soon. The effort he puts in is unbelievable - that's one of the best lessons a young player can learn. If you don't have that hunger it will all pass you by. All the top players have desire. Someone like Luis Figo has talent but he also has the determination to be the best. I think I have that naturally but it can be improved, and that's what makes an ordinary player into a great player. Determination makes the difference.' </p> <p>Carrick's willingness to push himself was evident in his response to his first major setback. During his first few games he felt reasonably pleased with his contribution - but then came Old Trafford. When the champions destroyed West Ham on New Year's Day it was a wake up call: 'That was the game I thought: You have to take a step back and take a look at yourself and realise you are not as good as you thought you were. I learned from it, which showed when we played them the second time.' </p> <p>Euphoric revenge exacted a month later at the same venue in the FA Cup, suddenly gave the Hammers a sneaky feeling about claret and blue ribbons in May. 'If you go away to Man U and win, after that you think you can beat anyone,' Carrick confirms. For some of his team-mates, the giddy celebrations were tempered when news came through that Sunderland away was next on the agenda. Not Carrick. As a fully fledged member of the Toon Army, who used to scrabble for tickets to watch Kevin Keegan's Newcastle, it was another trip to relish. </p> <p>So how did a proud and prodigious Geordie who honed his talents at the legendary Wallsend Boys' Club end up in the smoke to learn his trade? It is a scathing indictment of Keegan's shortsighted decision to dispense with a reserve team, thus cutting off the main avenue of hope for aspiring kids. Carrick looked at the set-up, thought 'I've no chance of coming through here', and chose West Ham because of their reputation for promoting youngsters, coupled with their warm East End welcome. </p> <p>Now he calls it his home from home. He lives in the same Romford cul-de-sac as Cole, and has no hesitation in encouraging his younger brother to come on down. Once Graham Carrick - a chip off the old block by all accounts - has finished his GCSEs he too will join the West Ham family. Graham has a lot to live up to. Michael is almost bamboozled by what he has achieved so soon. Having set himself the target of 10 games this season - a decent improvement on last year - he has been virtually ever present. </p> <p>Then came the England call-up, unluckily cut short because of a hamstring strain. He thoroughly enjoyed going to meet the squad to play Spain, before returning to watch the match on TV at home - 'Aw, I was gutted,' he groans - but his chance will surely come again soon. Is he ready for international football? 'You don't actually know if you'll be ready for England until you play,' he replies, sensibly. 'I'm only 19 and I've got plenty of time, but it would be nice to be part of the new set-up as it evolves.' </p> <p>Now his name is being touted as Young Player of the Year. It's an accolade he would be thrilled with, but he would swap it for an FA Cup medal any day of the week. To those who wonder why West Ham are bothering to turn up against Tottenham when the year ends in their lucky number, he retorts with a mischievous laugh. He admits it looks like a very even contest, but insists he and his mates can swing the balance: 'If we can take our game to them we've got a really good chance of winning. If you look at me, Lamps and Joe we're not a team of ball-winners who fight and scrap, but if we can get the ball down and pass it we can come out on top.' </p> <p>The young claret-and-blue brotherhood is essential to West Ham's future. Carrick only hopes it will stay that way for a few more years to come. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Doctors are set for 'golden hellos' to lure them into general practice under new plans to tackle a shortage of GPs. </p> <p>Cash incentives for young doctors to take up less popular jobs in the community, plus 'golden handcuffs' deals to persuade older family doctors not to retire early, are expected to form the heart of the \u00a3135 million package being drawn up by Health Secretary Alan Milburn. </p> <p>Ministers have bowed to warnings from the profession that there are not enough GPs to meet promises of better, faster treatment. 'We know GPs are under pressure and that the only real answer to the service challenges they are facing is to address the numbers,' said one source close to Milburn. 'Our recruitment and retention package will ensure we deliver on the target of 2,000 more by 2004 - and if we can deliver that earlier than promised, all the better.' </p> <p>Milburn was working out detailed proposals this weekend, after securing funding in last week's Budget. The scheme is expected to be modelled on similar incentives for teachers, where graduates are to be offered \u00a32,000 'golden hellos' to pay off student debts if they stay in teaching. </p> <p>Doctors' leaders say rising workloads, organisational upheaval and a 'culture of blame' after episodes such as the Shipman murders are putting young doctors off general practice. Older colleagues are also becoming disillusioned: a recent survey of Scottish GPs found 60 per cent considering leaving for other careers, with nearly three-quarters less happy now than five years ago. </p> <p>Thousands of GPs recruited abroad in the Sixties and Seventies are approaching retirement, leaving more holes to be plugged. </p> <p>'When people of my generation and younger entered general practice it was the exciting place to be: there was considerable competition for vacancies. That has completely turned around in the last 10 years,' said Dr John Chisholm, chair of the BMA's general practice committee. 'As far as young doctors are concerned, about half are going to need to become GPs and that is just not happening.' </p> <p>Likely options include changes to pension entitlements for older doctors, making it more worthwhile to stay on after 60; family-friendly policies for women returning after career breaks; and allowing GPs who have retired early to come back without damaging their pension entitlements.</p>",

Cash incentives for young doctors to take up less popular jobs in the community, plus 'golden handcuffs' deals to persuade older family doctors not to retire early, are expected to form the heart of the \u00a3135 million package being drawn up by Health Secretary Alan Milburn. Ministers have bowed to warnings from the profession that there are not enough GPs to meet promises of better, faster treatment. 'We know GPs are under pressure and that the only real answer to the service challenges they are facing is to address the numbers,' said one source close to Milburn. 'Our recruitment and retention package will ensure we deliver on the target of 2,000 more by 2004 - and if we can deliver that earlier than promised, all the better.' Milburn was working out detailed proposals this weekend, after securing funding in last week's Budget. The scheme is expected to be modelled on similar incentives for teachers, where graduates are to be offered \u00a32,000 'golden hellos' to pay off student debts if they stay in teaching. Doctors' leaders say rising workloads, organisational upheaval and a 'culture of blame' after episodes such as the Shipman murders are putting young doctors off general practice. Older colleagues are also becoming disillusioned: a recent survey of Scottish GPs found 60 per cent considering leaving for other careers, with nearly three-quarters less happy now than five years ago. Thousands of GPs recruited abroad in the Sixties and Seventies are approaching retirement, leaving more holes to be plugged. 'When people of my generation and younger entered general practice it was the exciting place to be: there was considerable competition for vacancies. That has completely turned around in the last 10 years,' said Dr John Chisholm, chair of the BMA's general practice committee. 'As far as young doctors are concerned, about half are going to need to become GPs and that is just not happening.' Likely options include changes to pension entitlements for older doctors, making it more worthwhile to stay on after 60; family-friendly policies for women returning after career breaks; and allowing GPs who have retired early to come back without damaging their pension entitlements.",

Cathy Pharoah, research director at Charities Aid Foundation, is aware of the gulf and the main reason for it. 'US charitable giving is higher because of giving by the rich. For individuals worth below $1 million it is about the same,' she says. </p> <p>The effects on the charitable sectors in each country are startling. The \u00a33.3 billion donated by Bill Gates last year was almost three times the combined income of the UK's top 10 charities in 1999. Such largesse boosts the average US giving per household to five times that in the UK. Clearly, something needs to be done about the wealthy. Now something has. </p> <p>Describing itself as 'A new organisation to make it easier for philanthropy to thrive' The Institute for Philanthropy was established in London at the end of 2000. Peter Mimpriss, a partner in Allen and Overy, one of its backers, says: 'The institute's objective is to bring the level of charitable giving up to that of the States.' Hilary Browne-Wilkinson, director of the institute, explains its philosophy. 'The Institute's founders believe that philanthropy will thrive when private wealth is matched with more sympathetic Government policy towards tax allowances and a society that encourages and rewards giving.' </p> <p>She says the Institute of Philanthropy intends to inject fresh thinking. 'We will be looking at how philanthropy works overseas, in particular the US, to see whether there are lessons we can take advantage of in this country.' In addition, it will conduct and encourage independent research, to boost giving and to ensure that good causes receive the maximum benefit from donations. </p> <p>Browne-Wilkinson intends that the whole charity sector will benefit rather than specific charities. 'We won't advise charities individually, but will dispense advice so they will be informed.' </p> <p>Mimpriss says part of the institute's work will be to educate people about how to give. 'We will help them to go through in some detail each of the many ways available to them, and help them to embark on a culture of giving.' The institute will focus on 'anyone who feels they might have some money left over,' he says. In reality this is more likely to be the wealthy. </p> <p>Browne-Wilkinson believes the time is right. 'There is wealth now that there hasn't been for many years, and the significant changes brought about by last year's Budget, mean there are now tax incentives which will encourage individual private giving.' </p> <p>Clive Mackintosh, head of private clients at Price Waterhouse Coopers, accepts that a benign tax regime can make a significant difference. He says: 'Tax breaks are very important, though some people would deny they are giving for that reason.' </p> <p>But even for the non-wealthy, understanding the tax implications of the different ways of giving can make a big difference to the donor and to the charity. And following last year's Budget, which brought in some important changes, here are some of the main ways both can benefit. </p> <p><strong> Gift Aid </strong></p> <p> The Gift Aid scheme now applies to any donation: it was previously limited to one-off donations greater than \u00a3250. The donation is treated as a net amount after deduction of basic rate income tax. The charity can then claim this from the Inland Revenue. Higher tax rate donors may claim higher rate tax relief via their self assessment form. </p> <p>Cathy Pharoah says this change could see extra revenue of \u00a3200- \u00a3400 million per annum over the next few years. Barnardo's say: 'Gift Aid will increase our income by at least \u00a3500,000 a year.' </p> <p>According to Clive Mackintosh: 'As income tax is the most difficult to get relief from, it is the most important way of giving for our clients.' </p> <p><strong> Give As You Earn </strong></p> <p> With Give As You Earn the donor pays direct from their gross salary before tax has been deducted, and the Government adds an extra 10 per cent. </p> <p>There is now no maximum donation. Barnardo's say: 'The 10 per cent top-up on payroll giving from Government will add a further \u00a3300,000 over a three-year period.' </p> <p><strong> Shares and Securities </strong></p> <p> UK taxpayers donating quoted shares or securities to a charity can obtain double relief. They avoid capital gains tax liability on the gift and gain relief at their marginal rate of income tax. </p> <p>Here is an example: A higher rate income tax payer (40 per cent) makes a gift of quoted shares worth \u00a320,000. His income tax liability reduces by \u00a38,000 (\u00a320,000 at 40 per cent) making the after income tax cost \u00a312,000. If the shares included a capital gain of \u00a310,000, capital gains tax liability of \u00a34,000 is avoided. This reduces the full after-tax cost of the gift to \u00a38,000. </p> <p>Stephen Burgess, charities consultant to accountants Saffery Champness, says: 'If you organise it properly the value to charity can be up to five times the after-tax costs to the donor.' Christine Cryne, director of marketing at Help the Aged, says: 'Giving of shares and securities is tiny. There is low awareness, and companies haven't really thought about it. We would prefer the cash, but it is early days.' </p> <p><strong> Charitable Trusts </strong><br> </p> <p> Anyone setting up a charitable trust can benefit from generous tax breaks. Donors may benefit by using any of the methods mentioned. Where basic rate tax relief is claimed, it is added to the trust. However, where quoted shares and securities are gifted, the tax benefits go to the donor while the trust receives the shares. </p> <p>The Charities Aid Foundation says: 'A personal charitable trust is the perfect way to support causes, even beyond your lifetime.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>For Michael Jackson to set himself up as a defender of children's rights seems hardly more plausible than Mullah Omar, head of the Taleban, declaring himself curator-in-chief of the Buddhist statuary of Afghanistan. Seven years ago, Jackson reached a multi-million dollar, out-of-court settlement with Jordan Chandler, a boy who claimed that the singer had had sex with him. While the payment does not imply guilt in Jackson, who denied the allegations, the episode left an unpleasant aftertaste never quite dispelled until last week, when the star, his china-doll face currently adorned with a nose on which you could squeeze lemons, bewitched the Oxford Union. </p> <p>There Mr Jackson delivered his \"planet-healing\" message that \"childhood has become the great casualty of modern living\". He retold the well-rehearsed story of his bad relationship with his father. He launched his Heal the Kids foundation, which has now been asked by the Charity Commissioners to \"clarify a number of issues\". A tear drizzled through his eye-liner and his enraptured audience gave him a three-minute standing ovation. </p> <p>Most newspapers reported the speech politely and prominently. The Guardian devoted a slab of its front page to the story, appending the \"universal bill of rights\" compiled by Mr Jackson and enshrining, among other sugared garbage, \"the right to be thought of as adorable [even if you have a face only a mother could love]\". By coincidence, on the same day but tucked towards the back, the papers carried the brief story of a child never deemed adorable by an \"unfeeling\" mother or by the father who slammed her against the ceiling and hurled her bruised body into the air to \"toughen her up\", shortly before shaking her to death. </p> <p>Chelsea Brown was two when she was murdered. A social worker had visited often but took no action despite Chelsea's many injuries and her father's violent record. A hospital doctor who treated a black eye said the damage was accidental. And so another child was left to die, like Anna Climbie a few weeks ago and, before her, a long litany in which only the names and the faces vary. The mistakes, always similar, eventually herald the muted reportage, stripped of shock or anger, that marked Chelsea's death. What is there left to say? But hopelessness does not betoken heartlessness. Of course we care. Hence the emotional reaction to Michael Jackson's maudlin tales of childhood and the deference paid to his banal bill of rights. When child abuse is too disturbing or dispiriting to confront, then the sanitised version, filtered through the prism of celebrity, becomes a new reality. </p> <p>Perhaps as a respite from a diet of decline - bad hospitals, bad transport, bad schools - we are all starstruck now. Almost every debate has been correspondingly lobotomised. On racism, the big story is Anne Robinson being nasty to the Welsh. Of course she would be. If rudeness is your hallmark, and if you must confess your loathings on television, you are not going to say you have never been mad about pop socks or over-boiled Brussels sprouts. So the Welsh get teased. Cue fabricated fury, acres of lovely publicity for Robinson and, surreally, squeaks by two MPs for her to be hauled before the Welsh affairs select committee and forced to apologise for her 'racist' remarks. Is this what Sir William Macpherson had in mind? </p> <p>Forget violent crime statistics. What we need to know is who gunned down EastEnder Phil Mitchell. More expensive spectacles for the elderly? The only optical story around is the ban by Coronation Street 's style police on the windshield glasses favoured, these days, only by arc-welders and Deirdre Rachid. The scandal of Dr Harold Shipman (aka James Bolam of The Likely Lads) is being turned into a \u00a31.5 million TV docu-drama even before inquiries are concluded.

      "bodyText": "For Michael Jackson to set himself up as a defender of children's rights seems hardly more plausible than Mullah Omar, head of the Taleban, declaring himself curator-in-chief of the Buddhist statuary of Afghanistan. Seven years ago, Jackson reached a multi-million dollar, out-of-court settlement with Jordan Chandler, a boy who claimed that the singer had had sex with him. While the payment does not imply guilt in Jackson, who denied the allegations, the episode left an unpleasant aftertaste never quite dispelled until last week, when the star, his china-doll face currently adorned with a nose on which you could squeeze lemons, bewitched the Oxford Union. There Mr Jackson delivered his \"planet-healing\" message that \"childhood has become the great casualty of modern living\". He retold the well-rehearsed story of his bad relationship with his father. He launched his Heal the Kids foundation, which has now been asked by the Charity Commissioners to \"clarify a number of issues\". A tear drizzled through his eye-liner and his enraptured audience gave him a three-minute standing ovation. Most newspapers reported the speech politely and prominently. The Guardian devoted a slab of its front page to the story, appending the \"universal bill of rights\" compiled by Mr Jackson and enshrining, among other sugared garbage, \"the right to be thought of as adorable [even if you have a face only a mother could love]\". By coincidence, on the same day but tucked towards the back, the papers carried the brief story of a child never deemed adorable by an \"unfeeling\" mother or by the father who slammed her against the ceiling and hurled her bruised body into the air to \"toughen her up\", shortly before shaking her to death. Chelsea Brown was two when she was murdered. A social worker had visited often but took no action despite Chelsea's many injuries and her father's violent record. A hospital doctor who treated a black eye said the damage was accidental. And so another child was left to die, like Anna Climbie a few weeks ago and, before her, a long litany in which only the names and the faces vary. The mistakes, always similar, eventually herald the muted reportage, stripped of shock or anger, that marked Chelsea's death. What is there left to say? But hopelessness does not betoken heartlessness. Of course we care. Hence the emotional reaction to Michael Jackson's maudlin tales of childhood and the deference paid to his banal bill of rights. When child abuse is too disturbing or dispiriting to confront, then the sanitised version, filtered through the prism of celebrity, becomes a new reality. Perhaps as a respite from a diet of decline - bad hospitals, bad transport, bad schools - we are all starstruck now. Almost every debate has been correspondingly lobotomised. On racism, the big story is Anne Robinson being nasty to the Welsh. Of course she would be. If rudeness is your hallmark, and if you must confess your loathings on television, you are not going to say you have never been mad about pop socks or over-boiled Brussels sprouts. So the Welsh get teased. Cue fabricated fury, acres of lovely publicity for Robinson and, surreally, squeaks by two MPs for her to be hauled before the Welsh affairs select committee and forced to apologise for her 'racist' remarks. Is this what Sir William Macpherson had in mind? Forget violent crime statistics. What we need to know is who gunned down EastEnder Phil Mitchell. More expensive spectacles for the elderly? The only optical story around is the ban by Coronation Street 's style police on the windshield glasses favoured, these days, only by arc-welders and Deirdre Rachid. The scandal of Dr Harold Shipman (aka James Bolam of The Likely Lads) is being turned into a \u00a31.5 million TV docu-drama even before inquiries are concluded. The Townsend Report on 'Breadline Europe' is eclipsed by pre-publicity for the BBC's fatuously-entitled Pants To Poverty initiative and, amid the tributes to John Diamond, a leading surgeon's warning that the government's cancer plan is dangerously flawed merits only a paragraph or two.

      "bodyText": "A century ago it chronicled the lives of the rich and famous. But the Dictionary of National Biography was seen as a flawed work for its refusal to include certain prominent figures because of scandals in their private lives or undesirable professional behaviour. Now, in the first fully revised edition of the DNB, people such as the spy Guy Burgess, Lord Randolph Churchill, previously ignored because of his alcoholism, and others who were shunned for being homosexual will be included. The slogan of the DNB - founded in 1901 and open only to the dead - may have been 'all human life is there' but critics argued that it neglected an array of colourful characters because of its moral censorship. The Oxford University Press editors of the New DNB say it is time to reflect changing social attitudes. 'The original Victorian edition recognised that many people who attract attention in the historical record do so for the wrong reasons,' said Robert Faber, director of the project. In the new edition, there is an acknowledgement for an 18th-century Oxford college head, Warden Thistlethwayte of Wadham, previously shunned for involvement in a homosexual scandal. One of those who makes it in for the first time is George Washington - omitted when British imperialism was rampant - as part of the new policy of including candidates with links to the British Isles. Even Jack the Ripper, although never identified, will make an appearance as will Robert Maxwell and Rillington Place killer John Christie. The DNB plans to revise all existing 36,000 articles and add 14,000 new ones over the next four years. Women will also be given greater prominence as the editors try to modernise the dictionary. Diana, Princess of Wales, will be included along with the lesser known Phyllis Pearsall who brought out the first London A-Z maps. Pop stars, comedians, sports men and women and what the editor, Brian Harrison, calls 'non-metropolitan' people will be also feature more heavily.

      "body": "<p>The last time I saw Zo\u00eb Wanamaker was not on the stage. I was walking along a residential street in Islington, north London, when I saw a woman climbing into a cab. Everything about her expressed haste, as if she were on the run, like the White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland. Her face was unmistakable. I stared at her, pleasantly conscious of my invisibility. I wondered how it must be to have a life in which you could not be sure of your privacy, never be confident that some curious stranger was not spying on you. </p> <p>Zo\u00eb arrived late at the Donmar Warehouse offices in Covent Garden, as if discharged from the same cab in which I had seen her all those months ago. She looked excessively pale, as though persecuting herself. Her haircut spikily conspired with the overall effect. 'Forgive me,' she panted, calling for vodka and ice as if in a drought, rolling up her liquorice cigarette as if in a whirlwind and subsiding opposite me. </p> <p>She is rehearsing in a stunning David Mamet play, A Boston Marriage, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. It is about two lesbians who have an intrigue over a splendid emerald necklace, a young woman and each other. It is about possession and reads, at times, like a tryst between Oscar Wilde and Henry James. 'I'd love to get hold of those emeralds,' Zo\u00eb reflected, conjuring them in her mind's eye: 'I am sure they are massive, Edwardian...' She held her glass up to the light and the ice-cubes tinkled in a receptively neurotic way. </p> <p>Zo\u00eb's acting career began when she was in her late twenties. Had she ever played a really small part? 'No,' she admitted eventually. To say that she is versatile is an understatement: she can do Shakespeare and Sophocles (her Electra won her a Tony in 1997); she can do 'character' parts of every kind. She recently played Cora, a mad aunt in Gormenghast for the BBC. And she has broken the mould by playing a dog (in A.R. Gurney's Sylvia ) and a leprechaun (in an American mini-series, directed by John Henderson). But Zo\u00eb is best known, at least by non-theatre goers, as Tessa Piggott, the have-it-all heroine of Love Hurts, the television series in which she co-starred with Adam Faith. </p> <p>I told Zo\u00eb about my last sighting of her. Did she pine for invisibility? She leant over and pointed her finger so close to my face it almost touched it. 'This is what some people would do', she said. She blames television. 'People stared at me and I found it very intrusive. It unnerved me.' It was as if she were public property, and although she would not wish success away, she longs to deflect such attentions. </p> <p>In interviews, I note, she welcomes the chance to talk about her late, much-loved father, actor and producer Sam Wanamaker, founder of the Globe theatre in Southwark. It is another way of bypassing herself. And when she talks about him, it is as if she were sitting in the shade of a safe rock. </p> <p>Zo\u00eb is tiny, a pixie in grey. She seems much smaller in the flesh than on stage. She has a fascinating face: she can look like a cat and then, suddenly, like a bird. How strange to be both! She has a thin mouth, as if an animator had drawn it at speed, a turned-up nose and quizzical blue eyes. She has never been pleased with her looks. 'Who is?' she wondered. She quickly amended this to 'What woman is? If they are, I wouldn't want to know them.' </p> <p>It is impossible to believe she is 52. I was looking at her in profile because she sat side-saddle in her chair. Her audience was the ceiling, the middle distance, the ground. Occasionally, she looked my way, a direct look that might have coincided with tipping the ash off the end of her cigarette. It is ironic that she should be so disturbed by the idea of possession now that she is in a play about ownership. 'Mamet wrote A Boston Marriage for his wife,' she told me. She revels in the 'sense of surprise' in his writing. 'He wrong-foots you...' she explained. She thinks the play has an 'intrigue that resembles Victorian melodrama'. </p> <p>I mentioned the line in the play: 'Always accept gracefully what you dare not refuse', a quotation from Gertrude Stein, and suggested that A Boston Marriage could be summed up by turning the quote inside out: always give away gracefully what you dare not keep. But Zo\u00eb is busy scribbling down 'Gertrude Stein'. She is diligent, bothered, doing homework. The play is the thing. </p> <p>What is her greatest weakness as an actress? It is the thing that children assume, usually mistakenly, to be the hardest thing about acting. She finds it difficult to learn her lines. And: 'I do get ill. Nervous is not the right word. I don't want to fuck up.' She is afraid of 'not doing my job, not being a creative human being, of being stumped. I never feel ready. It takes me too long to be comfortable before an opening night.' Was she pleased with her work in the end? 'Eventually.' </p> <p>She betrayed no nerves about the new Harry Potter film in which she will play Madam Hooch. Hooch has 'short grey hair and yellow eyes like a hawk' and can tell Harry and his chums how to mount their broomsticks and get a grip correctly. Hooch is a bit of a school marm, barking at young wizards, silver whistle in hand. Zo\u00eb's Madam Hooch will be all bird, 'definitely an eagle'. She looks forward to the flying lessons (they have not shot the flying yet because the actress playing Hermione Grainger fell ill). The action, Zo\u00eb revealed, will take place in a 'quasi turn-of-the-century boarding school full of gowns and cloaks and hats.' Zo\u00eb has an exclamatory laugh, 'Hah!' Like catching someone else red-handed, it is a laugh of discovery. Discovery is her thing. She talks about 'finding' parts, as though they had gone missing. She finds rehearsing 'invigorating and exhausting,' an exacting sequence of choices: 'Every line is a decision that may hinder or help.' </p> <p>She speaks as though roles had to be worn - she describes trying to 'feel comfortable' in them. She will have to work hard to feel comfortable as Mamet's Anna. The writing is deliberately, exorbitantly overdressed, which makes reading the script like trying to imagine someone naked. Zo\u00eb compares it to music. She has been in plays that left her feeling tone deaf. </p> <p>To distract her from the stage and get her to look my way again, I asked her, on impulse, what food she would like to take to a desert island (we had touched on her 'Desert Island Discs' earlier). She turned round, looked fiercely at me, assessing my question in all its triviality. Then she threw her head back and bellowed: 'Salad! I love it to death!' </p> <p>And music? What did she listen to when she wanted to unwind? 'Craig David - whatever the kids are listening to.' She has two teenage stepchildren - a boy and a girl by her husband, writer and actor Gawn Grainger. I told her I did not know she was married. 'Didn't you? Oh cool.' She sounded endearingly like a teenager herself. She loves being a stepmother, she said. She enjoys the fact that she does not have to pretend to be the children's mother: 'You can only be their friend - you just want to be there for them.' </p> <p>She married at 45. She announced proudly and curiously, as though she could not believe it was herself she was describing: 'We are in our seventh year.' She sometimes regrets the time spent unmarried, but: 'You are so pleased that you are there. You think: how lucky is that?' For years, she avoided marriage. She had her opportunities, she implied, but it never felt right. She resists the way women are made to feel invisible without a husband. 'I refuse to be browbeaten into thinking a man in your life means you exist and without one you don't'. And yet she seems to find marriage a relief to these embattled feelings. </p> <p>Love came to her without warning - as it does in Auden's 'Tell me the truth about Love' - and, as in that poem, changed her life altogether. Sam Wanamaker had just died of prostate cancer. Her mother, Charlotte Holland, finding life lustreless without him, died not long after. 'The death of my father and the appearance of this person [Gawn Grainger] coincided. And I realised then that half my life was gone.' The awareness of mortality was strong for Gawn and Zo\u00eb. Grainger's wife, Janet Key (whom Zo\u00eb used to know) also died of cancer. </p> <p>Zo\u00eb is a spokesperson for the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. When her father was dying he did not want to linger. She once confessed that she and her sister discussed whether to smother him with a pillow to end his misery. </p> <p>She came to England from America when she was three; her parents were in flight from McCarthyism. She went to King Alfred's, a co-ed, private, progressive school in north London and always knew she wanted to act. Disguises appealed. Her father used to come back from California with outlandish clothes for her. 'I remember the wonderful striped tights.' She wanted to give her own name the slip. She didn't like 'Zo\u00eb' and preferred 'Mandy'. Unthinkable, I protested: she would never have got where she is today as 'Mandy'. She laughed. Later, when she was studying drama at Central, she wished she could shed 'Wanamaker'. It was the name given to her great-grandparents, Russian Jews, when they fled the pogroms for New York. It is also, she has discovered, the name of an uneventful street in Pensylvania 'with one rooming house and a store'. </p> <p>Her father asked: 'Why are you ashamed of your name? They are going to find out who you are anyway.' Now she is grateful for it: 'It got my foot in the door.' Neither of her sisters (she is the middle one) felt tempted to act. Zo\u00eb's advice to any young person wanting to do so is plain: 'You really have to want to do it, that's all. It's got to be: you're going to die if you don't do it. It is full of rejection, particularly for women. And you don't retire at 60.' </p> <p>We strolled out into Neal Street together. Our pace was leisurely. Without warning, she said goodbye and turned down a side street. Now you see her, now you don't. </p> <p>\u0095 Boston Marriage runs at Donmar Warehouse, London WC2 until 14 April.

      "body": "<p>Wine lovers who want to make prats of themselves usually have to wait until the third Thursday in November, when Beaujolais Nouveau Day gives them the chance to don black berets and Breton shirts or windsurf across the Channel with a bottle of youthful Gamay tucked inside their wetsuits. This year, they can get involved in Red Nose Day and its spin-off, Wine Relief. </p> <p>The vinous part of Red Nose Day was launched at Vinopolis in London a couple of weeks ago, when celebs wearing red noses stripped to their boxer shorts, climbed into a makeshift lagar and trod grapes for charity. You won't find me in a paddling pool, let alone a lagar, on 16 March, but in the spirit of Comic Relief I will drink nothing but British, Bolivian and Zimbabwean wines next Friday. </p> <p>It's tempting to be cynical about Comic Relief. The dreadful, semi-literate slogan ('Say pants to poverty'), the relentless luvvieness of it all can be hard to swallow. But when I read a report by a colleague involved in Wine Relief 1999, who had been to Rwanda and seen the difference fund-raising can make, my cynicism faltered. </p> <p>In 1999, Wine Relief raised \u00a3350,000.

This year, they can get involved in Red Nose Day and its spin-off, Wine Relief. The vinous part of Red Nose Day was launched at Vinopolis in London a couple of weeks ago, when celebs wearing red noses stripped to their boxer shorts, climbed into a makeshift lagar and trod grapes for charity. You won't find me in a paddling pool, let alone a lagar, on 16 March, but in the spirit of Comic Relief I will drink nothing but British, Bolivian and Zimbabwean wines next Friday. It's tempting to be cynical about Comic Relief. The dreadful, semi-literate slogan ('Say pants to poverty'), the relentless luvvieness of it all can be hard to swallow. But when I read a report by a colleague involved in Wine Relief 1999, who had been to Rwanda and seen the difference fund-raising can make, my cynicism faltered. In 1999, Wine Relief raised \u00a3350,000. The aim this time is to reach \u00a3500,000, according to Nick Lander, restaurant critic of the Financial Times , whose wife, wine writer Jancis Robinson, is leading the initiative.

      "body": "<p>So you'd like to run your own restaurant? Well, of course you would: you hold fabulous dinner parties and your friends are always raving about the food. They adore that thing you do with lamb, and the ginger-spiced beans you serve on the side, and your ironic take on the pavlova. And each time, as your guests leave, sated and content, you stand by the door waving them off and think: why the hell am I giving this stuff away? Why don't I do it for a living? Pack up the job, dig into savings, touch the mother-in-law for a loan. It will be a gas. I'm a natural. </p> <p>Stop! This is the story of three groups of people who also decided to open their own restaurants: Iqbal Wahhab, Jonathan and Jane Wright, and Richard Neat. None of them are amateurs like you. They are all old hands, with decades of experience in the restaurant business between them. They know what they are doing, which is handy because the combined cost of their dreams is now close to \u00a34.5m. Yet for all their professionalism, their detailed understanding of the money to be made from human pleasure, none of their plans has gone smoothly. Each has faced their own peculiar disasters and their crises and their setbacks. And each of them will tell you exactly the same thing: that when it comes to the restaurant business, the very last thing you get to do is turn on the stove and start cooking. </p> <p>Some time next week, they will do exactly that at a new restaurant on London's Great Smith Street, near the Houses of Parliament. Probably. Where the Cinnamon Club is concerned, a little caution is wise, so often has its launch been postponed. There are many reasons for this, not least the big mouth of the man whose project this is, Iqbal Wahhab. For years Iqbal, a former journalist and public-relations man, has nurtured a dream: to open a restaurant that takes Indian food to new levels of sophistication. He has long wanted to own the first Indian restaurant in Britain to gain a Michelin star. 'I had seen the scale of service at Michelin-starred restaurants,' he says, 'and the kind of presentation, and I wanted to bring that experience over to Indian food. I knew it could be done.' </p> <p>In late 1997, he formed a company, Indian Restaurants Ltd, raised \u00a3100,000 from investors and found himself a chef, Vineet Bhatia, who had been at the well-regarded Star of India in Fulham, London. 'I told Vineet \"I don't want poppadoms at the Cinnamon Club\",' Iqbal says. 'Vineet understood immediately. It's a cluttered start to the meal, and it's associated with the lager brigade. I don't want that.' Lager would not be available by the pint at the Cinnamon Club. </p> <p>Soon they had a location for their restaurant on Kensington High Street: 5,000sq ft of space looking out over Kensington Gardens. It was just the thing. The budget was set at \u00a31.1m-\u00a3700,000 to come from investors, the rest from the bank. That was how much Iqbal reckoned his dream would cost. </p> <p>Then, a few months later, he kicked over his own apple cart. He wrote a column for Tandoori Magazine , which serves the Indian restaurant sector, in which he criticised the standard of service at most curry houses. 'Walk into any Indian restaurant,' he wrote, 'and no matter how posh, more likely than not you will be greeted by a miserable git.' The effect was almost instantaneous. 'One guy wanted to invest \u00a3500,000 but he said he couldn't now because he was Bangladeshi and the community had turned against me.' </p> <p>The financing fell apart because everybody had been waiting for the big investor to put his money in before getting involved. They lost the High Street Kensington site - now a branch of the Japanese noodle chain Wagamama - because they couldn't pay the rent. And then Bhatia gave up waiting and took a new job as head chef at Zaika. 'By Christmas 1998, we were restaurantless and chefless,' Iqbal says. 'How I regret writing that column. It was just something I did in a rush.' </p> <p>Two years in the wilderness followed, as he looked at site after site, placed deposits on some and was rejected by others, until he came across the old Public Library in Westminster, a grand lump of red-brick Victoriana with two floors and a mezzanine gallery. It had parquet floors and wood panelling. It would be the perfect place for an upmarket Indian restaurant with no poppadoms. The lease was up for grabs and every other major player in the London restaurant business - the Conran group among them - had designs on it. Iqbal's interest was rejected. He was a first-timer, the property agents told him. He didn't have enough money behind him. He was a risk. 'I had to force my way in to see the chairman of the company who owns the freehold. I told him the Cinnamon Club would bring him prestige.' He got the lease. </p> <p>Now costs spiralled from that original \u00a31.1m to the \u00a31.75m it would cost to convert a library, but he managed to raise it. He parted company with his architects and the costs rose again, this time topping \u00a32m. He managed to raise that, too. Then investors dropped out and the whole deal looked shaky. 'About a year ago, my brother took me out to lunch and said, \"Set yourself a deadline for this\". No one could have tried harder, but you've got to know when to stop.' </p> <p>He didn't. In India, at a friend's wedding, he found a new chef, Vivek Singh, who was cooking at the Rajvilas Hotel in Jaipur, one of the best in the world. He arranged for 10 other chefs to follow him direct from India, plus a container-load of fresh herbs and spices which would be flown over every week. He drew up plans for 50 waiters and a members-only club. It was the year 2000 and, two years after he first thought his restaurant would open, Iqbal reckoned the Cinnamon Club would finally become a reality. </p> <p>Only not quite yet. By the time we first met last November, the buzz was that Iqbal's great project - which has been muttered about in London restaurant circles for years - would finally open just before Christmas. So would it? 'Unfortunately not,' he says. 'We've had to put it back into next year. I'm looking at Valentine's Day now.' Why the new delay? 'We've had to find an extra \u00a3225,000 VAT on the builders' costs. And cash upfront for furniture.' He's raised the money, of course. Iqbal always seems to raise the money. The budget has gone to \u00a32.4m. At this point, what he has to show for it is an old Victorian library on the outside and a building site on the inside. There is rubble everywhere. It will, he says confidently, be terrific. </p> <p> In 1995, a new restaurant called Bank opened on London's Aldwych. It was sharp and modern and cool, cost \u00a33m to get up and running, and set the record for a British launch. Since then, that record has been broken by China House on Piccadilly, which cost \u00a35m, though the owners argue they got value for money because it is home to two restaurants. Either way, there is no doubt that the cost of opening restaurants has exploded, and the only place for those costs to go is on to the bill. 'Up to about five years ago, you could probably get away with opening a good neighbourhood restaurant for around \u00a3300,000,' says Ian McKerracher, chief executive of the Restaurant Association, who has done it. 'Now it's at least half a million.' </p> <p>Partly, McKerracher says, it's the rents. But it's also staff wages: a fascination with food has led to a restaurant boom, and that in turn has led to a shortage of staff, who can demand bigger pay packets. 'You have to understand that in the restaurant business, you will spend 80 to 90 per cent of your time simply trying to keep your workforce happy.' </p> <p>Jonathan Wright knows all about that. He has hair made for day-time television and a serious pedigree in the kitchen. He has been head chef at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons and has helped oversee the 17 separate restaurants at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. But all along what he really wanted was his own place which, like his hair, he could shape into a style of his own. 'I wanted to be my own person,' Jonathan says. In 1997 he and his then girlfriend, now wife, Jane scraped together \u00a310,000 and found an investor to put in the same amount. 'But we couldn't find a site because we didn't have enough cash behind us.' They lost all their own money - plus all of their investor's cash. Now needing an income, Jonathan took the job of executive chef at Terence Conran's new London hotel, the Great Eastern, near Liverpool Street. 'I knew after three months it was the wrong job. All I did was sit in an office, dealing with staffing issues.' </p> <p>So he quit and, like Iqbal, started looking for a site. 'We could have bought a de-listed pub but I didn't want that,' says Jonathan. 'I wanted something big enough to have a certain opulence. We must have looked at a dozen sites in and around Oxford, but none of them was right.' Finally, he and Jayne found a mock villa on the outskirts of the city. It was perfect. It would cost \u00a31.1m to open it as their dream restaurant which, with great effort, they have managed to raise. They will call it La Gousse d'Ail - French for 'clove of garlic'. </p> <p>Around us, deep-orange paint is still going on the walls. Lights are still being fitted into the ceiling. The bar is still being fitted. 'We'll be ready,' says Jane. 'Everybody's working round the clock.' At the moment, the real problem is staff: they just can't find enough good cooks, certainly not for the intense 'modern haute French' food they are planning. 'I had a pastry chef who arrived yesterday and who left today,' Jonathan says. 'He said he couldn't find his way to the restaurant from his flat. He was whingeing and moaning. He had to go. So me and my deputy, we'll do the pastry.' But, for all that, he's confident. He's sure there are enough people in Oxford willing to pay the \u00a340 a head he'll be charging \u00e0 la carte. In about four days time, he'll find out. The day before my visit, five days before the first paying customers were due, he turned on the new stoves in his new kitchen for the first time. </p> <p> It is January and Iqbal is showing me around his building site. There is now a concrete staircase down to where the kitchens will be, though there are no kitchens to speak of, just a brace of industrial-scale tandoor ovens sitting alone in the middle of the floor. 'There's one piece of kit, the kitchen hood, which has to go in before everything else, and that's holding it all up.' As we survey the unfinished floors and the unplastered walls, the truth becomes blindingly obvious. You're not going to open on Valentine's Day, are you? 'No we're not,' he says. But isn't this just eating money? After all, his chef is already here and being paid. 'We're funded to see the project through,' he says. 'The budget has gone to \u00a32.6m. And Vivek isn't sitting on his arse. He's sourcing ingredients. He's planning menus.' </p> <p>But still, these delays must be infuriating. 'Look, the focus now is on what we need to do to make it work. It's not the time for recriminations. But believe me, heads will roll. We've started an in-depth analysis of the delays and where they came from and how much they cost, and I will be discussing it with my lawyers.' He continues showing me around. Suddenly he says: 'It's terribly frustrating. It's not just that I want my restaurant. There's credibility involved both with investors and with the media.' </p> <p> It has been an interesting first few weeks at La Gousse d'Ail. On the day of the launch cocktail party, they were trying to fit two enormous glass sliding doors on the front of the wine store, which are a design feature of the restaurant. In the modern restaurant business, you need design features. The punters expect them. The glass was toughened but hadn't been allowed to cool for the full five days and, as they were being fitted, exploded across the room. 'A few of our builders were cut,' Jane says. The piping in the kitchen above where the food goes out also sprang a leak on opening night, but they solved that with a couple of bowls. The more serious problem was - still - staffing. Within a week, they had parted company with their restaurant manager. 'The public loved him, but on the management side it was just too much. We also lost a couple of the younger chefs who simply couldn't do the job to the standard we wanted.' So they are all working round the clock in the kitchen to keep up. </p> <p>The menu has seen some changes, too, with the withdrawal of one starter, a ravioli of quail. 'It was the most expensive and the least selling,' Jonathan says. 'It wasn't necessary.' So what's going well? 'The best starter is roasted scallops with pan-fried ceps, and the main course is the crispy duck with spiced figs. But you can never know what's going to be popular.' Any other problems? 'I've had to ask one table to leave. They were an hour late, and there were 10 of them instead of six, and then they wouldn't come through to the restaurant. They started complaining when we tried to get them to the table. One of them was leaning over the cheese with his burning cigarette. We don't need that.' </p> <p> The chef Richard Neat is now on to his fifth restaurant launch, 'so I should know what the hell I'm doing by now,' he says languorously. (He does almost everything languorously, except cook.) Even he and his partners, though, have been bugged by the same problem affecting almost every restaurateur in Britain: the search for a location. 'Over the past year we have looked at loads of properties and kept being second on all of them,' says Richard's business partner Robert Saunders. 'There was a former Japanese house of ill repute in the West End that we wanted, but that went. And then there were the 35th and 36th floors of CityPoint tower in the City of London. We really wanted that one.' Finally, Saunders heard that the second floor of the Oxo Tower, on the south bank of the Thames by Blackfriars Bridge, was up for grabs. It had previously been a restaurant called Bistro Two, was therefore fully kitted out (the first rule of opening a new restaurant: find an old one - it's much cheaper) and had the added interest of being a few floors below the well-known but often criticised Oxo Tower restaurant. 'I brought Richard over to see it on a wet grey day when the colours off the river were just unbelievably awful. He didn't get it at all.' </p> <p>So they carried on looking and 18 months after they first started planning their restaurant they have finally settled on a location: the second floor of the Oxo Tower. It seems the colours are not that bad after all. There are lots of expensive company headquarters nearby, hungry for business lunches, there's a nice view of the river, and it is a landmark building. What's more, there's space enough for both a gastronomic restaurant for 120 and a more relaxed bistro seating 150. It would need a staff of more than 70 and would use the two fully functioning kitchens. It's ambitious stuff, but then it has to be: Richard Neat has a reputation to live up to. In 1996, he became the youngest chef in Britain to win two Michelin stars (at Pied \u00e0 Terre) before disappearing off to Cannes in the south of France (via India), where he became the first British chef to win a star in France. While the Cannes restaurant will continue, the new place marks a return to the capital. </p> <p>'I want to do something intricate and clever,' says Richard. 'I enjoy intricate. Simple bores me. Furthermore, you attract a more exotic breed of chef by doing intricate.' There will also be a few innovations and a few retro touches, he says. For example, all prices will include service. On the retro side, Richard announces that he wants to bring back that great 70s favourite, the sweet trolley. 'The thing is, if you can see what's there you're more likely to have pudding, which has to be good,' he says. 'We can lay out some great old-fashioned tarts and flans.' </p> <p>Their vision - dishes such as truffle and asparagus souffl\u00e9 or rabbit in an olive sauce in the restaurant - will cost the punters at least \u00a3100 for two (significantly less in the bistro). Is Richard not concerned the prices will frighten the customers away? The chef sighs. 'You have to look at costs,' he says. 'Wages account for 25 per cent of the total. Rent is another 5 per cent. Then there's the VAT, which we don't see any of.' He runs on and on through the various sums, the profit margin slicing thinner than bresaola as he speaks. A top chef must, it seems, know his numbers as well as his sauces. 'It's not like chefs are thieves,' he says. In any case, he adds, while the pricing may be standard for London, the quality will be much higher. Anybody who has tried Richard's cooking knows it is not an idle boast. The cost of this dream is - like the others - set at \u00a31.1m. Last October, they set about raising it, with the hope of opening their doors this month. </p> <p> Three months after opening, La Gousse d'Ail in Oxford is, to all intents and purposes, a success: its food has been generally well received, even if one critic suggested it was trying a little too hard. The service, though, has been praised to the stars; as far as customers are concerned, everything there is working beautifully. In the kitchen, however, it's another story. 'We're at least four cooks down at the moment,' Jonathan Wright says, as he plates up dishes during the lunchtime rush, carefully positioning confit duck legs and fillets of cod on their plates. </p> <p>'What that means is that we're on our knees when it comes to preparation. The service itself is going perfectly but we're all having to get in here at ungodly hours to get ready. We don't have time to stop.' There is, apparently, a shortage of 15,000 chefs in Britain at the moment and La Gousse d'Ail is suffering. They still don't have a pastry chef. As for bookings, they are brilliant in the evenings, less so at lunchtime, for which they have introduced a few bargain deals to entice in the punters. But these, they say, are the details. Despite the staffing problems, the exploding glass doors and the rare troublesome customer fagging away over the Brie de Meaux, this is what they hoped for. 'Our investors are happy,' he says. 'And so are we.' </p> <p>Richard Neat's investors are also happy, though there are slightly fewer of them than they hoped for. They will not say exactly how big their budget is, but they haven't reached the \u00a31.1m they originally intended. It will still be a fully fitted out restaurant but 'It will be a work in progress,' says Richard. 'Our customers will be able to watch the restaurant develop.' One thing is certain: for the number of covers, the scale of operation and the location, the Neat launch represents the best value for money for its investors of the three. There is one disappointment. They have concluded they can't include service in the prices as they hoped. 'If it's included in the price, it has to incur VAT, which service added to the bill doesn't,' says Robert Saunders. 'That will mean around an extra 2 per cent on the bill, and we don't want to do that. It's bloody irritating.' On the plus side, they will still do the sweet trolley. They will start wheeling in April when they open their doors. Then again, it may be May. </p> <p>As to the Cinnamon Club, 6 March has been and gone and the restaurant has not opened. 'It's going to be 21 March,' says Iqbal. 'Definitely.' There were no specific delays this time. It just all took longer than was expected. But then it always has. Now, though, it really is happening. They even have a menu: there will be sandalwood-flavoured Tandoori chicken breasts and home-smoked lamb kebabs. There will be turbot in a Kerala red-curry sauce and wild-boar chops with Indian rice vermicelli. And no poppadoms. It reads beautifully. It might even be the sort of thing that the inspectors from Michelin would go for. It could get the Cinnamon Club that first star for an Indian restaurant which Iqbal Wahhab so craves. </p> <p>There's only one problem. In January Michelin announced its ratings for 2001. Two Indian restaurants, Tamarind and Zaika, were given one star each. To rub salt in the wound, the chef at Zaika is Vineet Bhatia, the first chef at the nascent Cinnamon Club all those years ago. 'Everybody knows I wanted to be the first to get a Michelin star, so there's no point denying it,' he says. 'But I'm pleased for them.' And then he says: 'I'll just have to go for two stars.' Only a fool would think he was bluffing; Iqbal Wahhab has a reputation for sticking with it.</p> <p>\u0095 La Gousse d'Ail, 268 Woodstock Road, Oxford (01865 311 936).

      "bodyText": "So you'd like to run your own restaurant? Well, of course you would: you hold fabulous dinner parties and your friends are always raving about the food. They adore that thing you do with lamb, and the ginger-spiced beans you serve on the side, and your ironic take on the pavlova. And each time, as your guests leave, sated and content, you stand by the door waving them off and think: why the hell am I giving this stuff away? Why don't I do it for a living? Pack up the job, dig into savings, touch the mother-in-law for a loan. It will be a gas. I'm a natural. Stop! This is the story of three groups of people who also decided to open their own restaurants: Iqbal Wahhab, Jonathan and Jane Wright, and Richard Neat. None of them are amateurs like you. They are all old hands, with decades of experience in the restaurant business between them. They know what they are doing, which is handy because the combined cost of their dreams is now close to \u00a34.5m. Yet for all their professionalism, their detailed understanding of the money to be made from human pleasure, none of their plans has gone smoothly. Each has faced their own peculiar disasters and their crises and their setbacks. And each of them will tell you exactly the same thing: that when it comes to the restaurant business, the very last thing you get to do is turn on the stove and start cooking. Some time next week, they will do exactly that at a new restaurant on London's Great Smith Street, near the Houses of Parliament. Probably. Where the Cinnamon Club is concerned, a little caution is wise, so often has its launch been postponed. There are many reasons for this, not least the big mouth of the man whose project this is, Iqbal Wahhab. For years Iqbal, a former journalist and public-relations man, has nurtured a dream: to open a restaurant that takes Indian food to new levels of sophistication. He has long wanted to own the first Indian restaurant in Britain to gain a Michelin star. 'I had seen the scale of service at Michelin-starred restaurants,' he says, 'and the kind of presentation, and I wanted to bring that experience over to Indian food. I knew it could be done.' In late 1997, he formed a company, Indian Restaurants Ltd, raised \u00a3100,000 from investors and found himself a chef, Vineet Bhatia, who had been at the well-regarded Star of India in Fulham, London. 'I told Vineet \"I don't want poppadoms at the Cinnamon Club\",' Iqbal says. 'Vineet understood immediately. It's a cluttered start to the meal, and it's associated with the lager brigade. I don't want that.' Lager would not be available by the pint at the Cinnamon Club. Soon they had a location for their restaurant on Kensington High Street: 5,000sq ft of space looking out over Kensington Gardens. It was just the thing. The budget was set at \u00a31.1m-\u00a3700,000 to come from investors, the rest from the bank. That was how much Iqbal reckoned his dream would cost. Then, a few months later, he kicked over his own apple cart. He wrote a column for Tandoori Magazine , which serves the Indian restaurant sector, in which he criticised the standard of service at most curry houses. 'Walk into any Indian restaurant,' he wrote, 'and no matter how posh, more likely than not you will be greeted by a miserable git.' The effect was almost instantaneous. 'One guy wanted to invest \u00a3500,000 but he said he couldn't now because he was Bangladeshi and the community had turned against me.' The financing fell apart because everybody had been waiting for the big investor to put his money in before getting involved. They lost the High Street Kensington site - now a branch of the Japanese noodle chain Wagamama - because they couldn't pay the rent. And then Bhatia gave up waiting and took a new job as head chef at Zaika. 'By Christmas 1998, we were restaurantless and chefless,' Iqbal says. 'How I regret writing that column. It was just something I did in a rush.' Two years in the wilderness followed, as he looked at site after site, placed deposits on some and was rejected by others, until he came across the old Public Library in Westminster, a grand lump of red-brick Victoriana with two floors and a mezzanine gallery. It had parquet floors and wood panelling. It would be the perfect place for an upmarket Indian restaurant with no poppadoms. The lease was up for grabs and every other major player in the London restaurant business - the Conran group among them - had designs on it. Iqbal's interest was rejected. He was a first-timer, the property agents told him. He didn't have enough money behind him. He was a risk. 'I had to force my way in to see the chairman of the company who owns the freehold. I told him the Cinnamon Club would bring him prestige.' He got the lease. Now costs spiralled from that original \u00a31.1m to the \u00a31.75m it would cost to convert a library, but he managed to raise it. He parted company with his architects and the costs rose again, this time topping \u00a32m. He managed to raise that, too. Then investors dropped out and the whole deal looked shaky. 'About a year ago, my brother took me out to lunch and said, \"Set yourself a deadline for this\". No one could have tried harder, but you've got to know when to stop.' He didn't. In India, at a friend's wedding, he found a new chef, Vivek Singh, who was cooking at the Rajvilas Hotel in Jaipur, one of the best in the world. He arranged for 10 other chefs to follow him direct from India, plus a container-load of fresh herbs and spices which would be flown over every week. He drew up plans for 50 waiters and a members-only club. It was the year 2000 and, two years after he first thought his restaurant would open, Iqbal reckoned the Cinnamon Club would finally become a reality. Only not quite yet. By the time we first met last November, the buzz was that Iqbal's great project - which has been muttered about in London restaurant circles for years - would finally open just before Christmas. So would it? 'Unfortunately not,' he says. 'We've had to put it back into next year. I'm looking at Valentine's Day now.' Why the new delay? 'We've had to find an extra \u00a3225,000 VAT on the builders' costs. And cash upfront for furniture.' He's raised the money, of course. Iqbal always seems to raise the money. The budget has gone to \u00a32.4m. At this point, what he has to show for it is an old Victorian library on the outside and a building site on the inside. There is rubble everywhere. It will, he says confidently, be terrific. In 1995, a new restaurant called Bank opened on London's Aldwych. It was sharp and modern and cool, cost \u00a33m to get up and running, and set the record for a British launch. Since then, that record has been broken by China House on Piccadilly, which cost \u00a35m, though the owners argue they got value for money because it is home to two restaurants. Either way, there is no doubt that the cost of opening restaurants has exploded, and the only place for those costs to go is on to the bill. 'Up to about five years ago, you could probably get away with opening a good neighbourhood restaurant for around \u00a3300,000,' says Ian McKerracher, chief executive of the Restaurant Association, who has done it. 'Now it's at least half a million.' Partly, McKerracher says, it's the rents. But it's also staff wages: a fascination with food has led to a restaurant boom, and that in turn has led to a shortage of staff, who can demand bigger pay packets. 'You have to understand that in the restaurant business, you will spend 80 to 90 per cent of your time simply trying to keep your workforce happy.' Jonathan Wright knows all about that. He has hair made for day-time television and a serious pedigree in the kitchen. He has been head chef at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons and has helped oversee the 17 separate restaurants at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. But all along what he really wanted was his own place which, like his hair, he could shape into a style of his own. 'I wanted to be my own person,' Jonathan says. In 1997 he and his then girlfriend, now wife, Jane scraped together \u00a310,000 and found an investor to put in the same amount. 'But we couldn't find a site because we didn't have enough cash behind us.' They lost all their own money - plus all of their investor's cash. Now needing an income, Jonathan took the job of executive chef at Terence Conran's new London hotel, the Great Eastern, near Liverpool Street. 'I knew after three months it was the wrong job. All I did was sit in an office, dealing with staffing issues.' So he quit and, like Iqbal, started looking for a site. 'We could have bought a de-listed pub but I didn't want that,' says Jonathan. 'I wanted something big enough to have a certain opulence. We must have looked at a dozen sites in and around Oxford, but none of them was right.' Finally, he and Jayne found a mock villa on the outskirts of the city. It was perfect. It would cost \u00a31.1m to open it as their dream restaurant which, with great effort, they have managed to raise. They will call it La Gousse d'Ail - French for 'clove of garlic'. Around us, deep-orange paint is still going on the walls. Lights are still being fitted into the ceiling. The bar is still being fitted. 'We'll be ready,' says Jane. 'Everybody's working round the clock.' At the moment, the real problem is staff: they just can't find enough good cooks, certainly not for the intense 'modern haute French' food they are planning. 'I had a pastry chef who arrived yesterday and who left today,' Jonathan says. 'He said he couldn't find his way to the restaurant from his flat. He was whingeing and moaning. He had to go. So me and my deputy, we'll do the pastry.' But, for all that, he's confident. He's sure there are enough people in Oxford willing to pay the \u00a340 a head he'll be charging \u00e0 la carte. In about four days time, he'll find out. The day before my visit, five days before the first paying customers were due, he turned on the new stoves in his new kitchen for the first time. It is January and Iqbal is showing me around his building site. There is now a concrete staircase down to where the kitchens will be, though there are no kitchens to speak of, just a brace of industrial-scale tandoor ovens sitting alone in the middle of the floor. 'There's one piece of kit, the kitchen hood, which has to go in before everything else, and that's holding it all up.' As we survey the unfinished floors and the unplastered walls, the truth becomes blindingly obvious. You're not going to open on Valentine's Day, are you? 'No we're not,' he says. But isn't this just eating money? After all, his chef is already here and being paid. 'We're funded to see the project through,' he says. 'The budget has gone to \u00a32.6m. And Vivek isn't sitting on his arse. He's sourcing ingredients. He's planning menus.' But still, these delays must be infuriating. 'Look, the focus now is on what we need to do to make it work. It's not the time for recriminations. But believe me, heads will roll. We've started an in-depth analysis of the delays and where they came from and how much they cost, and I will be discussing it with my lawyers.' He continues showing me around. Suddenly he says: 'It's terribly frustrating. It's not just that I want my restaurant. There's credibility involved both with investors and with the media.' It has been an interesting first few weeks at La Gousse d'Ail. On the day of the launch cocktail party, they were trying to fit two enormous glass sliding doors on the front of the wine store, which are a design feature of the restaurant. In the modern restaurant business, you need design features. The punters expect them. The glass was toughened but hadn't been allowed to cool for the full five days and, as they were being fitted, exploded across the room. 'A few of our builders were cut,' Jane says. The piping in the kitchen above where the food goes out also sprang a leak on opening night, but they solved that with a couple of bowls. The more serious problem was - still - staffing. Within a week, they had parted company with their restaurant manager. 'The public loved him, but on the management side it was just too much. We also lost a couple of the younger chefs who simply couldn't do the job to the standard we wanted.' So they are all working round the clock in the kitchen to keep up. The menu has seen some changes, too, with the withdrawal of one starter, a ravioli of quail. 'It was the most expensive and the least selling,' Jonathan says. 'It wasn't necessary.' So what's going well? 'The best starter is roasted scallops with pan-fried ceps, and the main course is the crispy duck with spiced figs. But you can never know what's going to be popular.' Any other problems? 'I've had to ask one table to leave. They were an hour late, and there were 10 of them instead of six, and then they wouldn't come through to the restaurant. They started complaining when we tried to get them to the table. One of them was leaning over the cheese with his burning cigarette. We don't need that.' The chef Richard Neat is now on to his fifth restaurant launch, 'so I should know what the hell I'm doing by now,' he says languorously. (He does almost everything languorously, except cook.) Even he and his partners, though, have been bugged by the same problem affecting almost every restaurateur in Britain: the search for a location.

While the Cannes restaurant will continue, the new place marks a return to the capital. 'I want to do something intricate and clever,' says Richard. 'I enjoy intricate. Simple bores me.

At the far end of the long, bleached-out room stands an open kitchen with a large rotisserie oven. It is this which dominates.

Which is to say that it contains lots of things which I am happiest eating. </p> <p>For my starter, I went for the toasted focaccia bread with roasted red onions and cheese at \u00a31.95. It was light and crisp and came with a sharp slick of oil and vinegar that lifted the caramelised onions away from the cloying. Tim chose the soup of the day (\u00a33.95), a rustic tomato with cheese, so dense it could have been eaten with a fork.

The chicken, and all the grills, come with chips or mash and a choice of two sauces from a list of a dozen. Some, like curried lychee with mango, may well have been put there for a laugh. I went for a rich onion gravy and a creamy honey mustard: both had real depth and had been made with some care. As to the half chicken, at \u00a38.75, it was a very good bit of bird but oddly disappointing.

      "byline": "Monty Don",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The rot has set in. I dug up an Allium giganteum to move it (incredible how bulbs end up in straight lines despite being planted as naturally as possible) and I found that half the bulb had rotted to a yellow ooze. The top growth, though, was surprisingly healthy, other than the blackened tips which almost all our late-flowering bulbs have, including the daffodils, as a result of the sharp frosts. I can live quite happily with blackened tips, and so it seems can they, but the rot is worrying. The reason is, I suppose, the appalling wet of last autumn. </p> <p>All these giant allium bulbs were planted with a good handful of grit beneath them, but clearly this was not enough to stop them sitting in water. Most summer bulbs originally come from places that have dry, cold winters for their dormancy and warm, dampish summers in which to grow and flower. We seem only to be able to supply half of that equation. Spring bulbs tend to want hot dry summers and wetter, milder winters, so the two types of bulb are unlikely to grow successfully in the same patch. It will be interesting to see how our giant alliums go on to perform and to what extent they recover and heal themselves. But the good news is that the most important thing for a summer-flowering bulb is getting the summer growing conditions right. Rich, free-draining soil with plenty of moisture - and for the uninitiated that means flowers such as alliums, lilies, crocosmia, dahlias, gladioli, galtonia and - euch, spit - begonias. </p> <p>The reason I moved some of the Allium giganteum was to make room for irises. No other flower sucks in light so voluptuously and returns it with such velvet intensity of pigment as an iris. We are pitifully under supplied with irises of any kind. As I get older, there are more and more spaces in my life where things just drop through, things that I really want, things that I could have, can afford and have time and room for, but somehow they just slip by. But this spring I shall make good the iris slippage. I know that unlike the spring irises such as Iris reticulata o I histrioides , the bearded irises are not really bulbs, growing as they do from rhizomes, but, hell, rhizome shizome, they are all family. </p> <p>There are loads of cultivars of beardless irises ranging from Miniature Dwarf Bearded that are officially less than 8in tall to the Tall Bearded, which must weigh in at 28in or more, and they come in every shade save red. Iris 'Dusky Dancer' is as near to black as dammit and there are quite a few that are genuinely brown, such as 'Jungle Shadows' and 'Wild Ginger'. Beardless include the Pacific Coast and Siberian Irises. The Pacific Coast irises like acidic, sandy soil, have evergreen leaves and tend to have subtler colours and gentler form than the bearded ones, spreading more rapidly to form large clumps, but share the same requirement of good drainage above all else. They will tolerate some shade. There are a whole clutch of named varieties of beardless Siberian iris other than the species Iris sibirica , I chrysographes , I clarkei and I forrestii . It seems to me that the choice is clear: if you have very heavy, poorly drained soil, then the beardless Pacific Coast and Siberian irises will give you the best iridescent hit, but if you have reasonably well-drained soil and a sunny site, then you must choose bearded irises for the full iris experience. </p> <p>Normally one reckons to plant summer bulbs at the same time as spring bulbs, in early autumn, but certainly things such as gladioli, dahlia or crocosmia should be left until the worst of the frost is past in spring and there is no reason to delay planting any summer-flowering bulb until next October. Our alliums, for example, were planted in January of last year. I have only just put some Lilium henryi in the ground and fully expect them to be flowering with orange Turk's-cap flowerheads by mid-July. We have grown lilies in pots for years and they do very well in containers as long as you get the compost mix right. We use sieved leaf mould and grit on a 2:1 ratio (it is probably nothing like that as I always do these things entirely by eye) and this works fine, although I read that the conventional mix is one part grit, one part coir or leaf mould (actually they say peat, but when it comes to peat, Just Say No) and one part loam. I have become a great fan of using loam in my compost mixes because it makes sense to me to start things in the medium in which they are to grow. Therefore, unsterilised loam will have all the microbes and tiny fungi of our garden soil and this must make the final transference from container to border more successful. </p> <p>I should have repotted the lilies in late summer, about a month or so after they finished flowering, but we have got in the habit of doing it about now and they don't seem to mind. The key thing about lilies in pots is to give them enough room - about three bulbs for a 5-litre or bigger pot - and then they will grow strongly and produce masses of flowers over a longer period. My plan from now on is to plant out all of last year's lilies into the garden and pot up fresh ones in their place. That way the garden stock will gradually increase. </p> <p>Of course, this regime presupposes that the bulbs will be left where they are once planted outside, which, on the whole, is fine for lilies, alliums, crocosmia, but a bit risky for many of the summer bulbs. I dig up and bring in dahlias and chocolate cosmos ( Cosmos atrosanguineus ) after the first proper frost, although occasionally I miss one and they always seem to grow back the following spring. This could mean that there is no need to dig them up but there could be yet more that I miss which fail to get through the winter, so they come in all the same. Dahlia tubers are easy to store, as long as they are in a cool yet frost-free dark place and packed in some kind of loose medium. I used to use perlite but this was a bit dry, so now we use potting compost, which seems to have the right balance of moisture and dryness. You do not want them to shrivel up and yet they must not rot. Cosmos are much more temperamental and we seem to lose as many as we save. I am not sure why. Plant your dahlia tubers at the beginning of April, setting them at least 4in deep so that the new shoots don't get frosted. </p> <p>I want to include agapanthus in this batch of summer 'bulbs' and you will find them included in various bulb books although they are not really a bulb at all. All ours are still in pots under fleece in the tunnel, but I suspect most did not make it past that big frost after Christmas. I have not dared to check yet. In a few weeks, I will take them all out of their containers, see what is quick and what is dead and repot them.

      "bodyText": "The rot has set in. I dug up an Allium giganteum to move it (incredible how bulbs end up in straight lines despite being planted as naturally as possible) and I found that half the bulb had rotted to a yellow ooze. The top growth, though, was surprisingly healthy, other than the blackened tips which almost all our late-flowering bulbs have, including the daffodils, as a result of the sharp frosts. I can live quite happily with blackened tips, and so it seems can they, but the rot is worrying. The reason is, I suppose, the appalling wet of last autumn. All these giant allium bulbs were planted with a good handful of grit beneath them, but clearly this was not enough to stop them sitting in water. Most summer bulbs originally come from places that have dry, cold winters for their dormancy and warm, dampish summers in which to grow and flower. We seem only to be able to supply half of that equation. Spring bulbs tend to want hot dry summers and wetter, milder winters, so the two types of bulb are unlikely to grow successfully in the same patch. It will be interesting to see how our giant alliums go on to perform and to what extent they recover and heal themselves. But the good news is that the most important thing for a summer-flowering bulb is getting the summer growing conditions right. Rich, free-draining soil with plenty of moisture - and for the uninitiated that means flowers such as alliums, lilies, crocosmia, dahlias, gladioli, galtonia and - euch, spit - begonias. The reason I moved some of the Allium giganteum was to make room for irises. No other flower sucks in light so voluptuously and returns it with such velvet intensity of pigment as an iris. We are pitifully under supplied with irises of any kind. As I get older, there are more and more spaces in my life where things just drop through, things that I really want, things that I could have, can afford and have time and room for, but somehow they just slip by. But this spring I shall make good the iris slippage. I know that unlike the spring irises such as Iris reticulata o I histrioides , the bearded irises are not really bulbs, growing as they do from rhizomes, but, hell, rhizome shizome, they are all family. There are loads of cultivars of beardless irises ranging from Miniature Dwarf Bearded that are officially less than 8in tall to the Tall Bearded, which must weigh in at 28in or more, and they come in every shade save red. Iris 'Dusky Dancer' is as near to black as dammit and there are quite a few that are genuinely brown, such as 'Jungle Shadows' and 'Wild Ginger'. Beardless include the Pacific Coast and Siberian Irises. The Pacific Coast irises like acidic, sandy soil, have evergreen leaves and tend to have subtler colours and gentler form than the bearded ones, spreading more rapidly to form large clumps, but share the same requirement of good drainage above all else. They will tolerate some shade. There are a whole clutch of named varieties of beardless Siberian iris other than the species Iris sibirica , I chrysographes , I clarkei and I forrestii . It seems to me that the choice is clear: if you have very heavy, poorly drained soil, then the beardless Pacific Coast and Siberian irises will give you the best iridescent hit, but if you have reasonably well-drained soil and a sunny site, then you must choose bearded irises for the full iris experience. Normally one reckons to plant summer bulbs at the same time as spring bulbs, in early autumn, but certainly things such as gladioli, dahlia or crocosmia should be left until the worst of the frost is past in spring and there is no reason to delay planting any summer-flowering bulb until next October. Our alliums, for example, were planted in January of last year. I have only just put some Lilium henryi in the ground and fully expect them to be flowering with orange Turk's-cap flowerheads by mid-July. We have grown lilies in pots for years and they do very well in containers as long as you get the compost mix right. We use sieved leaf mould and grit on a 2:1 ratio (it is probably nothing like that as I always do these things entirely by eye) and this works fine, although I read that the conventional mix is one part grit, one part coir or leaf mould (actually they say peat, but when it comes to peat, Just Say No) and one part loam. I have become a great fan of using loam in my compost mixes because it makes sense to me to start things in the medium in which they are to grow. Therefore, unsterilised loam will have all the microbes and tiny fungi of our garden soil and this must make the final transference from container to border more successful. I should have repotted the lilies in late summer, about a month or so after they finished flowering, but we have got in the habit of doing it about now and they don't seem to mind. The key thing about lilies in pots is to give them enough room - about three bulbs for a 5-litre or bigger pot - and then they will grow strongly and produce masses of flowers over a longer period. My plan from now on is to plant out all of last year's lilies into the garden and pot up fresh ones in their place. That way the garden stock will gradually increase. Of course, this regime presupposes that the bulbs will be left where they are once planted outside, which, on the whole, is fine for lilies, alliums, crocosmia, but a bit risky for many of the summer bulbs. I dig up and bring in dahlias and chocolate cosmos ( Cosmos atrosanguineus ) after the first proper frost, although occasionally I miss one and they always seem to grow back the following spring. This could mean that there is no need to dig them up but there could be yet more that I miss which fail to get through the winter, so they come in all the same. Dahlia tubers are easy to store, as long as they are in a cool yet frost-free dark place and packed in some kind of loose medium. I used to use perlite but this was a bit dry, so now we use potting compost, which seems to have the right balance of moisture and dryness. You do not want them to shrivel up and yet they must not rot. Cosmos are much more temperamental and we seem to lose as many as we save. I am not sure why. Plant your dahlia tubers at the beginning of April, setting them at least 4in deep so that the new shoots don't get frosted. I want to include agapanthus in this batch of summer 'bulbs' and you will find them included in various bulb books although they are not really a bulb at all. All ours are still in pots under fleece in the tunnel, but I suspect most did not make it past that big frost after Christmas. I have not dared to check yet. In a few weeks, I will take them all out of their containers, see what is quick and what is dead and repot them. There is absolutely no reason why I should not plant them into the borders, treating them just like dahlias, but they look so good in terracotta pots there does not seem any advantage in it. Then there is the begonia thing. They are summer bulbs, too. I am sure there are those that love them, but I completely fail to see why.",

The Home Office confirmed that this was one of the alternatives Ministers were currently considering. </p> <p>Observers fear this untried formula will waste money and drive down prison workforce pay and conditions. Last December, Martin Narey, the Director-General of the Prison Service, suggested that some of the 37 old and outdated jails could be sold to property developers and the proceeds used to build new prisons on derelict city centre land. </p> <p>Given New Labour's public borrowing phobia, its love affair with big business and its mistrust of the public sector, new jails will inevitably be privately built and managed under the PFI. </p> <p>For critics, this raises uncomfortable issues. In the eight years since the private sector has run jails, the prison population has leapt 20,000 to 65,000. By 2005, it is projected that there could be 92,000 people locked up in England and Wales. </p> <p>Professor Allyson Pollock, an expert on the public sector at University College London, said: 'The private sector needs prison numbers to increase in order to make a return. More prisons means bigger potential profits.

Who shapes criminal justice policy? Is it professionals, politicians and the public? Or is it Group 4 shareholders?' </p> <p>A senior IPPR official confirmed that Group 4 had helped fund IPPR research. But he stressed that Group 4 had neither contributed funds nor evidence to its report into PFI, due out in May. </p> <p>Since the Thatcher government allowed the private sector into prisons following lobbying by companies and the Adam Smith Institute, its performance hasn't exactly pulled up any trees.

This seems a moot point. </p> <p>Carillion and Group 4, the consortium that financed, designed, built and runs Altcourse prison in Liverpool, made an extra \u00a313m from a refinancing package, it emerged last year. Last June, the National Audit Office disclosed that Carillion and Group 4 raised their expected rate of return on the deal by 75 per cent once the project was running. Refinancing gave them a \u00a314m gain, of which the Prison Service received only \u00a31m. </p> <p>Peter Gershon, head of the Office of Government Commerce, and Sir Steve Robson, then second permanent secretary at the Treasury, warned private sector consortiums last summer that they risked 'killing the goose that lays the golden egg' if they did not share windfall profits with the public sector. </p> <p>Wholesale privatisation would be too disruptive - but no matter who wins the next election, prisons will increasingly be run by the private sector. </p> <p> <strong>The captive market</strong></p> <p><strong> Privately managed prisons</strong><br> </p> <p> (Prison Service still owns the buildings) </p> <p> <strong> Wolds, Humberside </strong> UK's first privately run remand prison - which cost \u00a338m - opened in 1992.

      "byline": "Peter Preston",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Labour's master spinners are haunted by an election worry about what's left of the Tory press. Not that they face blasting as usual in 'Nightmare on Kinnock Street' fashion - but rather, as Willie Whitelaw might have put it, the spectre of 'newspapers going round the country stirring up apathy'. </p> <p>For this time, as Millbank sees it, apathy kills. Every point by which election day turn-out drops hacks a swathe of seats from Blair's majority. While William Hague, shivering patriotic timbers, is getting the core Tory vote out, Labour floaters from 1997 will yawn and stay at home with their new Popstars. The general enemy is the assumption - from pundit to couch potato - that Labour has it in the bag and that a second term can be taken for granted. The specific enemy - welcome back our old chum, the Daily Mail - is a series of stinking, stinging attacks designed to build cynicism. It is a theory with substance, worth looking at down the press end of the telescope. </p> <p>First, Labour's poll lead is cavernous. If everybody assumes it's all over, it probably is. Second, smaller majorities make better headlines and - pace Francis Pym - better governments. Third, the pall of predictability reaches deep inside editorial offices themselves. </p> <p>We pretty much know already who'll endorse who. We could write the final editorials now. The Telegraph will vote Conservative. (Small earthquake in Canary Wharf: nobody wakes up.) The Mirrors , the FT, the Guardian and the Independent will stick to Labour with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The Express will commune with Posh Spice and then back Blair (to show that it's not the Mail). </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch said the other day he hadn't made his mind up yet, but never kid a kidder. The Sun made up its (Good on yer, Gordon) mind on Budget day. The Sunday Times chunters so much about Europe that perhaps nobody cares what it says elsewhere. The Times has a rare loathing for Hague. </p> <p>'Losing an election is a serious matter for any political democracy,' it observed last week after the foreign country fulminations, 'but losing a reputation for honour and decency is a much more serious one.' Change here will only come with the arrival of El Portillo. </p> <p>So, for a flicker of unpredictability, we are back with the b\u00eate noire of Derry Street. Even the Mail jumped ship four years ago as its benign proprietor announced his antipathy to modern Toryism. Well, Vere Harmsworth is in his grave and balances shift: the Mail is crabby about Blairism these days and occasionally - on married family tax breaks - mildly encouraging to Mr Hague. </p> <p>Nevertheless, nobody in Smith Square should expect a clear conversion. No editor - especially Paul Dacre, trailing his most-powerful-man-in-Britain glory - likes backing a losing side. No editor lightly urges his readers to do something they won't do. Thus, as the Millbank mob deduce, there will be opportunistic plagues on Labour's houses coupled with suitably agonised leaders. </p> <p>That may have the chilling effect the spinners fear. It may be the only byzantine way of helping a hapless Hague. But it also tugs at a dismal truth that afflicts all newspapers. </p> <p>This is simply that elections - moments of great decision - ought to herald buoyant sales figures. Engaged electorates equal paying customers, so there are two reasons for editors to get excited. Yet that is not the reality. </p> <p>Look at May 1997.

      "bodyText": "Labour's master spinners are haunted by an election worry about what's left of the Tory press. Not that they face blasting as usual in 'Nightmare on Kinnock Street' fashion - but rather, as Willie Whitelaw might have put it, the spectre of 'newspapers going round the country stirring up apathy'. For this time, as Millbank sees it, apathy kills. Every point by which election day turn-out drops hacks a swathe of seats from Blair's majority. While William Hague, shivering patriotic timbers, is getting the core Tory vote out, Labour floaters from 1997 will yawn and stay at home with their new Popstars. The general enemy is the assumption - from pundit to couch potato - that Labour has it in the bag and that a second term can be taken for granted. The specific enemy - welcome back our old chum, the Daily Mail - is a series of stinking, stinging attacks designed to build cynicism. It is a theory with substance, worth looking at down the press end of the telescope. First, Labour's poll lead is cavernous. If everybody assumes it's all over, it probably is. Second, smaller majorities make better headlines and - pace Francis Pym - better governments. Third, the pall of predictability reaches deep inside editorial offices themselves. We pretty much know already who'll endorse who. We could write the final editorials now. The Telegraph will vote Conservative. (Small earthquake in Canary Wharf: nobody wakes up.) The Mirrors , the FT, the Guardian and the Independent will stick to Labour with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The Express will commune with Posh Spice and then back Blair (to show that it's not the Mail). Rupert Murdoch said the other day he hadn't made his mind up yet, but never kid a kidder. The Sun made up its (Good on yer, Gordon) mind on Budget day. The Sunday Times chunters so much about Europe that perhaps nobody cares what it says elsewhere. The Times has a rare loathing for Hague. 'Losing an election is a serious matter for any political democracy,' it observed last week after the foreign country fulminations, 'but losing a reputation for honour and decency is a much more serious one.' Change here will only come with the arrival of El Portillo. So, for a flicker of unpredictability, we are back with the b\u00eate noire of Derry Street. Even the Mail jumped ship four years ago as its benign proprietor announced his antipathy to modern Toryism. Well, Vere Harmsworth is in his grave and balances shift: the Mail is crabby about Blairism these days and occasionally - on married family tax breaks - mildly encouraging to Mr Hague. Nevertheless, nobody in Smith Square should expect a clear conversion. No editor - especially Paul Dacre, trailing his most-powerful-man-in-Britain glory - likes backing a losing side. No editor lightly urges his readers to do something they won't do. Thus, as the Millbank mob deduce, there will be opportunistic plagues on Labour's houses coupled with suitably agonised leaders. That may have the chilling effect the spinners fear. It may be the only byzantine way of helping a hapless Hague. But it also tugs at a dismal truth that afflicts all newspapers. This is simply that elections - moments of great decision - ought to herald buoyant sales figures. Engaged electorates equal paying customers, so there are two reasons for editors to get excited. Yet that is not the reality. Look at May 1997. The Sun's circulation lost nearly 200,000 as campaigning began. April and May were way below the first three months of the year. The Mirror sold fewer copies in April and May than in January and February. The Express slid as usual. Nothing happened at the Mail until July (when politics went to the beaches). More glumly still, the April tallies for Telegraph, Guardian, Independent, Times and FT were all down on March. In short, elections are circulation downers, not uppers. The broadsheets get a boost the morning after the vote, but otherwise apathy barely needs stirring. And this was an election of upheaval, of change - the high tide of Blairism. One set of figures, of course, can't be the whole story. Yet, if you go back to 9 April, 1992, things were not so different. The Mirror, Sun and Express were all losers again; the Mail trod water; the Telegraph and the Times slipped back. Only the Guardian and the Independent, of surviving newspapers, made worthwhile gains. And here, significantly, may be the only kiss of life elections still provide. The really big winner in 1992 was Today, up from 460,000 to 533,000 over eight weeks. Like the Independent, it benefited from sampling and shopping around.

      "body": "<p>If you can't compete with Hollywood on its own terms, you need a hook, a gimmick. Think of the breakthrough films associated with the independent, low-budget Sundance Film Festival over the years and each had a unique selling point. The Blair Witch Project had the shaking cameras and the tease of cinema verit\u00e9 while Reservoir Dogs had the ear-slicing. </p> <p>With Clerks, it was the story behind the story of how Kevin Smith made the film for next to nothing at the store he was working at; with Slacker, it was the dozens of monologuing freaks, while Sex, Lies, and Videotape had the instantly immortal title. It was something you could grab straightaway, something that said: 'This Is Not Hollywood.' </p> <p>This year, the fuss has been about Richard Linklater's Waking Life, a conventional, talkie indie movie rendered extraordinary by its unsettling animation, and Memento, which is already something of a cult over here. </p> <p>Last year, Sundance's Grand Jury Prize was split between two films. One was the excellent Girlfight. Although it is a superb piece of ghetto realism, it also has a title that explains everything you need to know, and provokes debates about whether women should box. But the other winner, was You Can Count On Me. And here's the odd thing: You Can Count On Me has no obvious must-see factor. </p> <p>There is no high-concept reason why you should see this low-budget, small-town drama. It doesn't even have true outsider status: its writer-director Kenneth Lonergan wrote Analyze This and The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Matthew Broderick is in the cast and Martin Scorsese was executive producer. </p> <p>The bare outline of the plot doesn't help much either. The main characters are an orphaned brother (Mark Ruffalo) and sister (Laura Linney), now grown up. The sister is a single mother, who has stayed in the town and is trying to live a respectable life working at the bank; the brother is a slacker who escaped as soon as he could. That, and the title, had cynics suggesting it was going to resemble a TV movie. </p> <p>All You Can Count On Me has going for it is that it is a brilliantly subtle, intelligent, compassionate and terrifically-acted movie. And for once, the Academy has recognised its virtues, giving Laura Linney a best actress nomination and putting Lonergan in the running for best original screenplay. Linney can't win - this is Julia Roberts's year - but Lonergan just might, having already picked up a Writers' Guild award. </p> <p>'I like awards a lot when they give them to me, but I feel that one should not attach too much importance to them if one wants to avoid becoming a shoddy person,' Lonergan says on the phone from his New York apartment. Surely it is exciting to be nominated for an Oscar? 'Very exciting,' Lonergan says in a deliberate voice that is slightly unsettling. 'It's the highest honour our civilisation has to bestow.' </p> <p> You Can Count On Me is built around its fully-realised characters, right from the beginning, where we learn of the parents' death in an exquisitely-executed prologue. 'I do try hard to make sure that the story is driven by the personalities of the people involved, or by the circumstances they're in, and not by more general structural concerns. I generally follow what I think would happen.' The unexpected benefit of this is that the narrative of the film surprises you in a way that many films don't. 'I don't set out to to be unpredictable, but I don't want it to be predictable because not just in films but in plays you can always see what's coming a mile away.' </p> <p>Given that this is Lonergan's debut film and it has such an immediacy, the easy assumption - the one I made - is that it must be autobiographical. Not so. The small-town setting has nothing to do with Lonergan's upbringing in Manhattan's well-heeled Upper West Side. His take on small-town America is interesting, while dodging both the idyllic clich\u00e9s of Old Hollywood and its subversion by the likes of David Lynch. </p> <p>'The first isn't true, because nothing is absolutely wonderful, and the second is not the most interesting point to make anymore; it's been made many times by many fine plays and novels. I was mostly interested in two aspects of small-town life - the sense of peacefulness, quiet and serenity in town in a beautiful setting, combined with this feeling of isolation and constriction, and which of those two aspects come to the fore at what point.' </p> <p>Lonergan acts in the film - he plays the church minister who is called in by Sam (Linney) to try to get Terry (Ruffalo) to find some purpose in his life. Some critics have seen this as an authorial intervention, Lonergan arriving in the text like an eighteenth-century novelist to lay down the law. </p> <p>Lonergan dismisses the idea gently: 'That's a lovely idea that comes from their imaginations.' So is Lonergan a religious person? 'No, I was brought up in a very secular household, and don't believe in God or anything like it. Nobody believed in God in my house.' </p> <p>He is 38, son of a 'non-believing Irish-Catholic father and a non-believing Jewish mother'. He went to private school with Matthew Broderick, a lifelong friend who is superb in You Can Count On Me as Sam's officious new boss at the bank. 'People are starting to get the idea that he's not just the sweet, innocent Matthew, who does not exist in any form, by the way.' </p> <p>After NYU and a brief stint at the Royal Court, his writing career developed along two fronts: a growing reputation as a playwright in New York, and an attempt to establish himself as a screenwriter for hire in Hollywood, which mostly consisted of years of hawking Analyze This around. </p> <p>He has never seen the film, but says reports of his bitterness about what was done to his script, and his unsatisfactory time working on The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, are grossly exaggerated. </p> <p>'They were standard Hollywood experiences. I did not enjoy that process, and without approving of that process, I entered those situations with eyes wide open. I don't think I went in there with some artistic vision and got burned by bad people. I wrote Analyze This to sell it and make money and that's what happened.' </p> <p>What is clearly true is that the writing in You Can Count On Me owes nothing to the commercial strictures of his Hollywood scripts and a lot to his plays. 'I see myself as both a playwright and filmmaker. I'm very comfortable in the theatre.' </p> <p>That You Can Count On Me was a relatively unproblematic experience is due largely to Scorsese - Lonergan slightly self-consciously refers to him as 'Marty'. Knowing they were unlikely to give final cut to someone who had never directed anything on film before, Lonergan suggested to the company that they entrust the last say to Scorsese. With America's finest living director backing his decisions, Lonergan got his way. In return, Lonergan spent the winter in Rome doing script rewrites on Scorsese's epic Gangs of New York. </p> <p>Kenneth Lonergan is an interesting character, bright and strong. He's certainly got a lot more interesting work in him. But right now, he is waiting to see whether the Hollywood establishment will bestow an award on a film that has nothing to sell it but good writing, good acting and a laudable refusal to tie up loose ends. </p> <p>\u0095 You Can Count On Me opens on 23 March</p>",

      "body": "<p>Opinion has always been divided on Channel 5. Commercially, few in television would argue that it has been anything other than a pretty hefty success. Critically - well, that's another matter. </p> <p>However, as the fifth terrestrial broadcaster nears its fourth birthday later this month, it is a given that if Channel 5 is to continue driving up its audience share and advertising revenue, it needs to move away from the cheap, cheerful and sometimes saucy programmes that have so vexed TV puritans. </p> <p>Instead, it needs to invest more money to create its own EastEnders and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? - compelling shows that attract big audiences, week in, week out. </p> <p>So far, so simple. Except that Channel 5's owner, the French RTL Group, which holds 65 per cent, and United Business Media, which owns the other 35 per cent, appear at loggerheads over its future. </p> <p>There is a strong argument to be made that critics who bang on about shoddy Channel 5 programming are missing the point. The channel was not set up, like Channel 4, to encourage programming diversity and win bucket-loads of Baftas. It was always an out-and-out commercial beast that gave advertisers an alternative to ITV. </p> <p>And Channel 5 has achieved this goal fantastically well, in the process creating a business already valued at around \u00a31 billion.

      "bodyText": "Opinion has always been divided on Channel 5. Commercially, few in television would argue that it has been anything other than a pretty hefty success. Critically - well, that's another matter. However, as the fifth terrestrial broadcaster nears its fourth birthday later this month, it is a given that if Channel 5 is to continue driving up its audience share and advertising revenue, it needs to move away from the cheap, cheerful and sometimes saucy programmes that have so vexed TV puritans. Instead, it needs to invest more money to create its own EastEnders and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? - compelling shows that attract big audiences, week in, week out. So far, so simple. Except that Channel 5's owner, the French RTL Group, which holds 65 per cent, and United Business Media, which owns the other 35 per cent, appear at loggerheads over its future. There is a strong argument to be made that critics who bang on about shoddy Channel 5 programming are missing the point. The channel was not set up, like Channel 4, to encourage programming diversity and win bucket-loads of Baftas. It was always an out-and-out commercial beast that gave advertisers an alternative to ITV. And Channel 5 has achieved this goal fantastically well, in the process creating a business already valued at around \u00a31 billion. From a standing start in March 1997, it went on to achieve an average 5.4 per cent share of the national audience in 1999. In the second quarter of last year, the station hit an average of 6 per cent. Since then Channel 5 has hit a plateau, partly because of the Big Brother effect last September. It reached 6 per cent again in October, but slipped to an average of 5.6 per cent across the eight months to the end of last month.

      "body": "<p>Two years ago Paddy Considine played the obsessive loner in Shane Meadows's A Room For Romeo Brass. Considine, a non-professional who got the chance to make his screen debut partly due to a long-standing friendship with the director, gave a finely balanced performance that crackled with menace. </p> <p>Both Considine and the film received a rousing reception at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Here was a star in the making. But not yet. The following Monday he was back at the dole office in Burton-on-Trent. </p> <p>Considine, who initially trained to be a photographer, decided to concentrate on acting. His new film, Pawel Pawlikowski's The Last Resort, is another substantial effort from the British independent sector. In this Edinburgh favourite from last year he plays the unlikely romantic exiled to dreary Margate where he is a benign small-time entrepreneur. Catering to the needs of the local refugee population, he combines altruism and self-interest by deciding to help an attractive Russian illegal immigrant (Dina Korzun). </p> <p>A delicate romance unfolds, framed by Pawlikowski's expressionist vision of the Kent coastal town as a Kafka-esque final destination. Considine is superb as an aspirant everyman; rich in sentiment but rarely sentimental. </p> <p>The 27-year-old grew up on a council estate in Burton-on-Trent. After school he took a college drama course and met Meadows. The pair collaborated on a series of anarchic short films and formed a band. Then he completed a photography course, and later published and exhibited his images. </p> <p>Considine has a scene-stealing cameo in the British comedy Born Romantic and last year he also filmed Happy Now, a black comedy starring Ioan Gruffudd and Susan Lynch. </p> <p>He's currently working on 24 Hour Party People, the much-anticipated film about Factory Records and the Madchester scene. It will be only his fourth major film role but his choices to date are to be applauded. There are no wonky Britflick crime capers on his CV. Long may it continue. </p> <p>\u0095 Last Resort opens on Friday </p> <p><strong> Five things you need to know about Paddy Considine</strong><br> </p> <p> 1 He studied at Brighton University. 2 He got a first-class degree in photography. 3 He specialises in photographic studies of bare-knuckle fighters. 4 He likes to improvise a lot on set. 5 In 24-Hour Party People he plays Rob Gretton, the man who discovered Joy Division. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Two years ago Paddy Considine played the obsessive loner in Shane Meadows's A Room For Romeo Brass. Considine, a non-professional who got the chance to make his screen debut partly due to a long-standing friendship with the director, gave a finely balanced performance that crackled with menace. Both Considine and the film received a rousing reception at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Here was a star in the making. But not yet. The following Monday he was back at the dole office in Burton-on-Trent. Considine, who initially trained to be a photographer, decided to concentrate on acting. His new film, Pawel Pawlikowski's The Last Resort, is another substantial effort from the British independent sector. In this Edinburgh favourite from last year he plays the unlikely romantic exiled to dreary Margate where he is a benign small-time entrepreneur. Catering to the needs of the local refugee population, he combines altruism and self-interest by deciding to help an attractive Russian illegal immigrant (Dina Korzun). A delicate romance unfolds, framed by Pawlikowski's expressionist vision of the Kent coastal town as a Kafka-esque final destination. Considine is superb as an aspirant everyman; rich in sentiment but rarely sentimental. The 27-year-old grew up on a council estate in Burton-on-Trent. After school he took a college drama course and met Meadows. The pair collaborated on a series of anarchic short films and formed a band. Then he completed a photography course, and later published and exhibited his images. Considine has a scene-stealing cameo in the British comedy Born Romantic and last year he also filmed Happy Now, a black comedy starring Ioan Gruffudd and Susan Lynch. He's currently working on 24 Hour Party People, the much-anticipated film about Factory Records and the Madchester scene. It will be only his fourth major film role but his choices to date are to be applauded. There are no wonky Britflick crime capers on his CV. Long may it continue. \u0095 Last Resort opens on Friday Five things you need to know about Paddy Considine 1 He studied at Brighton University. 2 He got a first-class degree in photography. 3 He specialises in photographic studies of bare-knuckle fighters. 4 He likes to improvise a lot on set. 5 In 24-Hour Party People he plays Rob Gretton, the man who discovered Joy Division.",

Dogs have brought disparate people together (the homophobic Jack Nicholson and his gay neighbour in As Good as It Gets), and have helped solve crimes (Nick and Nora Charles's schnauzer Asta in the Thin Man films; Tom Hanks's giant watchdog in Turner and Hooch) and been the victims of murderers (Hitchcock's Rear Window). </p> <p>Before this column attracts the comment: 'Enough four-footed-friend flicks - Ed', let me proceed to the film that caused my mind to scamper down memory lane, the consistently funny Best in Show. It's directed and co-scripted by the American comedian Christopher Guest, who co-wrote and passed himself off as the English rock musician Nigel Tufnel in This is Spinal Tap.

Christopher Guest himself plays a North Carolina backwoods store owner, who has a bloodhound and counts as his hobbies hunting, reeling off lists of nuts, and ventriloquism. </p> <p>Next up the social scale is a lower-middle-class couple from Florida, with a tiny Norwich terrier; the husband (Eugene Levy, the film's co-author) quite literally has two left feet and is constantly being made aware of the raunchy past of his wife (Catherine O'Hara). From Illinois comes a yuppie couple (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), both lawyers and in therapy along with their weimaraner bitch dog that's been traumatised by seeing them have sex. </p> <p>New York contributes a pair of outrageous Cage aux Folles-style gays, the leading hairdresser Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean, another Spinal Tap alumnus) and his lover Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins), who dote on two fluffy little shih-tzus. Top of the social scale, but tackiest of all, is the gold-digging Sherri (Jennifer Coolidge), who's married a senile Pennsylvanian multimillionaire, but is on the brink of a lesbian affair with the expert dog handler (Jane Lynch), who cares for Rhapsody in White, Sherri's champion poodle. Guest never runs a scene too long or lets the actors (who improvised a lot of the material) step out of character. </p> <p>The hearts of all five couples are set on their dogs winning the best in their class, then going on to get the blue riband for 'best in show' at the annual Mayflower Dog Show, which has, we're persuaded, been held in Philadelphia since 1875. Here we meet another splendid collection of characters - the prissy descendant of the show's patrician founder, the manager of the coliseum where the event is staged and, most amusingly, the toffee-nosed manager (Ed Begley Jr) of the hotel where the dog owners traditionally stay.

Joe Maloney is a strange, dreamy boy who doesn't fit in and constantly plays truant. He feels different. 'It was so hard to separate what existed in his head from what existed in the world.' He lives with his mother, who loves him, doesn't understand him, but accepts him, in Helmouth, in a wasteland full of old names such as the Ratty Paddocks and the Lostleg Railway. When a circus full of eccentric and mysterious characters arrives, Joe is visited in his dreams by a tiger. 'The huge head hung over him. The glittering cruel eyes stared into him.' He is drawn to the circus and finds the bizarre people there seem to know all about him and the way he sees more than others see. Almond writes - and this could be his motto as a writer: 'Sometimes the most important things are the most mysterious.' At the end, the real world and the circus world come together in a delightful scene. For 10-ups.",

      "body": "<p>Five o'clock, Bloom's Hotel, Dublin. Shane MacGowan tumbles out of the lift into my waiting arms. The photographer and his assistant and I have been waiting since three, with a cheery Irish PR saying, 'Oh, this is nothing - he kept a journalist waiting four hours yesterday!' I want to murder him. We made various sorties to Shane's hotel room but were blocked by a burly man who seemed to be acting as his minder. </p> <p>So on the one hand I am relieved to see Shane at last. On the other hand, I quite want to bundle him back in the lift and forget him. I was prepared for the teeth, the famous blackened stumps, but the suit is an unanticipated horror show, with its thickening patina of stains down the trousers culminating in big blobby spatters on the shoes. If he has not been sick down his trousers several dozen times, he must have a very good stylist. His skin has the shiny pallor of someone who has never seen daylight. He lurches towards the bar. The photographer tries to head him off, saying he wants to do photographs outside before the daylight fades. Shane says, 'Ginantonic' and plonks himself in a chair. I chatter brightly about James Joyce; Shane mumbles unintelligibly; the photographer tears his hair. </p> <p>But eventually, with coaxing from the photographer, the assistant, the PR and me, we get him out into the street. He flinches as the last rays of sunlight hit him and sinks into a doorway - luckily a very photogenic doorway - and the photographer clicks away. Every single person who passes down the street stops and says, 'Shane, good on yer!' or 'How're you doing?' A few bravely rush up and hug him. I didn't realise till then that he is a sort of god in Dublin - or not a god, more a prodigal son. Everyone seems to know him, everyone seems to love him, even little old ladies who surely can't ever have been Pogues fans shake their heads fondly and say, 'Shane! God love you!' </p> <p>After the photographs, we stagger back to the hotel. I remark that the bar is terribly noisy - couldn't we sit somewhere else? Shane says, with sudden furious clarity - 'It's a bar . It's meant to be noisy.' The bar it is then - our home for the next six hours. Of all the Irish bars in all the world, this must be the most thoroughly charmless. It looks like a motorway Travelodge. </p> <p>But it is Shane's bar and no doubt after his death it will be called Shane's Bar - maybe the hotel will be rechristened Shane's Hotel. Gin and tonics begin to appear as if by magic - rows and rows of them filling the table, perhaps materialised by fairy folk because I never see them coming. </p> <p>I start by saying I very much enjoyed his book A Drink with Shane MacGowan - it is one of the freshest, most original biographies I've ever read. It's written as a conversation with his girlfriend, Victoria Mary Clarke, and it's a picture of their relationship as much as of his life. Shane, truculently, mumbles that it's not his book, and he is not happy with it. He doesn't like the title - 'a drink with Shane MacGowan' is not accurate because of course it is many drinks over many years. And then he doesn't like the byline - why is he credited as co-author when it was all Victoria's work? It was just an interview , he insists, just her sometimes switching on the tape recorder when they were talking. And he doesn't 'stand by' anything he is quoted as saying because he might say one thing one day and something else the next. </p> <p>So is he cross with her for writing the book? 'I can't be cross with her ,' he says indignantly, 'I love her!' But he is cross with the book. And with the publishers, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. There is some ongoing saga whereby he claims they agreed to pay his hotel bill and haven't done so. They say they did agree to pay - for two days while he was doing interviews - not the six weeks (and counting) he has stayed there. </p> <p>Anyway, he says ominously that he has not finished cutting the book. The press release claims that it recounts his days as a rent boy in London, but there is nothing about being a rent boy in the book. 'I can't believe you were a rent boy,' I say rudely, 'who would pay to rent you?' 'You'd be surprised,' he says. 'There are women who would climb over their grandmothers to get to a celebrity - Victoria, for instance!' and he emits the first of his exploding coffee-machine laughs. </p> <p>Where is Victoria now? 'Off ligging with U2 in London,' he says. She is Irish but prefers living in London - he prefers Dublin or Tipperary. He was meant to go to the U2 concert but couldn't face travelling to England. Travel must be a serious problem for him - Victoria in the book mentions the hours or even days spent in airports waiting to find a flight willing to take him. Once when he was booked to join Bob Dylan in the States, four flights came and went without him. </p> <p> And yet Victoria is obviously devoted - she calls him Sweet Pea throughout the book. They have been together 15 years, so why haven't they married? 'Because we never had enough celebrities in the same place at the same time.' (This gnomic utterance is later explained by Victoria - they plan to sell their wedding to Hello! or OK!.) 'But we're getting married this year. Hopefully.' And will they start a family? 'I think when we grow up we should [he is 43, she 35] - it's something we've discussed. But probably I'm dropping myself in the shit even talking about it.' </p> <p>His mother told him never to have children till he was rich. He was rich, he made millions with the Pogues, but he says now he's spent it all. 'If you hug money, you clog up the cash flow, know what I mean?' He says he's not destitute - he still gets enough from songwriting royalties to keep him in booze and fags - but he missed out on the rock-star mansions. All he owns is a flat in Gospel Oak which he shares with Victoria, and the old family farm in Tipperary which has no running water. His current group, the Popes, has never achieved success by Pogues standards. Supposing he never makes another record, will he have enough to live on? 'Well,' he sputters, 'I could always open supermarkets!' </p> <p>The wit is quick and comes like a wake-up call to me, reminding me of Bono's remark, 'Shane is more together than people imagine.' (Bono obviously respects him, because he lent him his Martello Tower to live in for a year after the Pogues split up.) Shane's speech may be slurred, his movements uncoordinated, he sometimes gets stuck on saying, 'Know what I mean? Know what I mean? Know what I mean?' till you want to scream - but he is not 'out of it'. On the contrary, he seems to be controlling this interview much better than me. When he doesn't want to answer a question, he ignores it, or mumbles into his G&amp;T. But every time he mentions an Irish name, he spells it out carefully, complete with accents, into my tape recorder. Moreover, unlike me, he remembers everything he says. This was brought sharply home a couple of hours into our conversation when the barman called him over to take a phone call. It was from Victoria and he came back saying, 'You've got to take out that line about her climbing over her grandmother to get to a celebrity. She didn't think it was funny. So take it out, or I'll fucking sue you, right?' (Later, in London, I persuaded Victoria to let me keep it in - she says it's OK because her grandmother is dead - but fancy him remembering.) </p> <p>Shane sees it as his duty to educate me in Irish history, so I'm in for a lot of lecturing about Brian Bor\u00fa, the Black and Tans, Michael Collins, Partition, 'Ireland is a woman', the craic, the whole tear-stained Emerald-Isle package. And yet if you step outside Bloom's Hotel, you can see that Dublin today is just about the glossiest, yuppiest place in Europe - it has such full employment it actually has to import workers. Hasn't Shane noticed? </p> <p>Evidently not. 'I live in the past. It doesn't feel like 2001 to me.' In any case, his Ireland is an entirely personal construct of songs and myths and stories his relatives told him in infancy, ie an Ireland that was probably extinct by the time he was born, if it ever even existed. He has lived in England since he was six - he won a scholarship to Westminster, for heaven's sake! (Admittedly only for a year, but still...) There are people who knew him in his teens who say he didn't have an Irish accent then. But, on the other hand, all his songwriting inspiration comes from Ireland and he achieved his 'crusade' with the Pogues to make Irish music hip and popular, to build Irish self-esteem. In fact, he was one of the founders of the current Irish cultural renaissance - it is just unfortunate that he looks more like a relic of the old pre-boom Ireland of hopeless old pissheads doing zilch. </p> <p>Shane's father 'likes a drink', his uncles, aunts, cousins ditto. Shane claims that when he was a small child in Tipperary, they gave him two Guinnesses a night as his bedtime drink and later, when he was eight, an uncle introduced him to Powers whiskey. He says he never really drew a sober breath after the age of 14. 'In our family it was like, if the kid likes a drink, let him have a drink - because all the kids who weren't allowed to have a drink turned into raging alcoholics.' Mmm, yes, Shane - and...? Even he notices some logical flaw in his argument because he starts sputtering, 'We'd never even heard of alcoholism. We'd have thought it was some kind of weird religion. Our household was an open house where no one was refused, there was a continuous ceilidh going on, people would come from miles around for a drink, 24 hours, there's always one or two people awake.' </p> <p>This was his mother's family's house in Tipperary, where he lived till he was six, while his parents worked in England. He says in the book, 'My life was a happy dream when I was a little boy.' But when he came to live with his parents in London, the picture grows darker and there are glimpses in the book of a deeply dysfunctional family - father out boozing every night, mother lying in bed with arthritis or depression, pilled out of her head, Shane trying to look after his little sister Siobhan. In the book he talks about his mother having a nervous breakdown but now he retracts that and says: 'I was just projecting you know. I was depressed.' </p> <p>When he was 17, he had a major breakdown and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for six months. 'I was drinking a lot and I'd been put on a heavy prescription of tranquillisers by the GP. This was a big thing in the 70s - there's thousands of people in mental hospitals who were made zombies by downers. Anyway, they got me off the gear, the drugs that had put me there, and I started drinking again - but then they wouldn't let me drink, which is where the trouble started. It was called Acute Situational Anxiety - which basically meant I didn't like being in London. Perpetual panic - I panic in London.' </p> <p>Does he panic about performing? 'No, that isn't the panic at all. My family were, are, all singers, performers. No, just sitting in a goddamn bloody flat in bloody London, that's a panic situation. Basically, I've been holding my breath half my fucking life. I can only relax when I'm in Ireland or one or two other places - Thailand, Spain, Japan and certain parts of America. I actually feel physically sick when I think of London.' </p> <p>And yet, Victoria told me later he seemed happy enough living in London till Christmas, but then he went to Dublin for a Popes concert and never came back. He now claims to live in Tipperary, in the old family farmhouse with the sign on the door saying 'Trespassers will be shot'. His parents live in a new house down the road. He describes them as 'very young at heart, intelligent, warm, loving sociopaths!' (Everyone else describes them as 'characters'.) But actually he seems to have been living in Bloom's Hotel, Dublin, since January. </p> <p>What it seems to boil down to is that he feels happy and sociable and safe drinking in Ireland, and depressed and lonely and paranoid drinking in London. But what about not drinking - is that ever a possibility? Yes, he says, 'I don't have to drink.' Victoria took him to the Priory last autumn for a dryout and he says it worked. But, er, what are all these glasses on the table? 'This isn't drinking. We're just having a couple of drinks, you know?' Right. How long did he stay sober after the Priory? 'As long as it took to get to the nearest bar.' So is that his pattern - to dry out, then start drinking again? 'I don't have a pattern. I can't remember from one day to the next.' </p> <p>At one point I said something about his attraction to drink and drugs, and he was suddenly beadily alert. 'What! I'm a drinker. I drink. But drugs, you said - I don't take drugs.' What? Never ? 'So long ago I can't remember.' He should read Victoria's book, then, because it's full of drugs - uppers and downers and acid and cocaine. He once said that by the time the Pogues ended in 1991 he was taking 50 tabs of acid a day - 'You get used to it, you can function on it.' </p> <p>But it has obviously become a touchy subject since November 1999, when Sinead O'Connor shopped him to the police for taking heroin. She told The Sun she went round to his flat and found him practically in a coma on the floor and called the police because 'I love Shane and it makes me angry to see him destroy himself.' He says he was sitting peacefully on the sofa watching a Sam Peckinpah video. Whatever - no police charges were brought. So was he ever on heroin? 'What - addicted to heroin?' Well, on heroin? 'I've tried it a long time ago.' The only drugs he will admit to taking now are prescription tranquillisers - 'If the doctor prescribes them, I take them, and sometimes quite a heavy dose, for stress. But at least I go to a doctor, know what I mean?' </p> <p> Midway through the evening, a man comes into the bar, sees Shane, and rushes over. Shane lurches to his feet and hugs him for a good five minutes. He is Gerry O'Boyle, former owner of Filthy MacNasty's bar in Islington, and they 'go back a long way'. Gerry rustles up a few more G&amp;Ts but, I notice, drinks water. He stays with us for the rest of the evening, and Shane seems happy to have him. Later, when I am drunk as a skunk, Gerry serves the useful purpose of changing the tape when necessary. </p> <p>At some point they decide to teach me how to say a rosary and both whip out their rosaries and an amazing array of medals and scapulas and plastic folders saying: 'I am a Catholic. If I am dying, please call a priest.' Shane says he would certainly want a priest if he were dying. One reason why he likes St John of God - a Dublin drying-out home he sometimes uses - is that it's run by nuns, and priests come round to hear your confession. 'I haven't been to mass for a long time. But I pray every day, every night. I pray all the time. I pray whenever I'm struck by fear and worry, and I pray in gratitude when the release is given to me, you know?' </p> <p>As a Catholic, doesn't he feel bad about not having children? 'I've got children!' How many? 'I don't know. I only know about one. He's a young man. He lives in Scotland. He knows where to get hold of me. I saw him once, when he was three. He knows I'm his father. Years ago, me and Lesley agreed that any time he wanted to come and see me he could come and see me and I'd take him out for a drink, get him whatever he wants. But she married a good man, and he seems to be satisfied with him as his father.' </p> <p>Later in the evening Shane and Gerry announce that they have decided they can trust me, so they will cut me in on the bank robbery they are doing tomorrow. They are driving to a country town, about an hour out of Dublin, and they need a getaway driver. 'She'd be a fucking brilliant driver!' Shane opines. 'She'd be a good driver, yes,' Gerry agrees. 'Well, I don't know. I stop at zebra crossings. I'm rather a slow driver,' I warn them. Both nod eagerly, 'See, if you were a fast driver, it would be very obvious. A slow getaway driver is good!' </p> <p>The evening reels on. Shane sings me ' Woman come in the name of love ' and ends with the plea - 'Can I not convince you to come out with us and rob a bank?' I tell him my husband wouldn't like it and he accepts that - obeying your husband is good. But, he suggests with great delicacy, perhaps my husband will die before me and then I can come out and rob a bank? I promise to think about it. </p> <p>Gerry reminds Shane periodically that there's a party at the Clarence they should go to. 'You come!' Shane orders. 'I haven't got anything to wear,' I whimper - rather a feeble excuse in view of Shane's suit. 'Come as you are,' he says magnanimously. So several hours or aeons later, we stagger into the glossy streets of Temple Bar round to the Clarence, which luckily is only a few yards. Apparently le tout Dublin is there - Candace Bushnell and Marianne Faithfull and two Corrs! But my vision isn't too great by this stage and in a sudden flash of clarity I realise I must go to bed or I will die. I totter over to Shane and say, 'Gorra go' - and somehow the big friend from his hotel room appears at my elbow and steers me gently back to the hotel. </p> <p>In the morning, badly hungover, I wander downstairs about nine to ask the receptionist what time I can decently phone Shane to say goodbye. 'Ask him,' she says cheerily. 'He's in the bar.' Ohmigod, he is - sitting at the bar with four or five G&amp;Ts in front of him, chatting to the barman. The barman looks near death but Shane looks much as usual. 'Where were you?' he says quite sharply - 'you missed a good night.' Apparently he and his friends went from the party to a club to another party and another club, where he sang a few songs. Then they came back to talk. But now everyone else has gone to bed, and he is quite eager to start chatting all over again. But sorry, Shane, I just can't face it and anyway I have to catch a plane. I tell him it was a joy to meet him and he lurches to his feet and says with great formality, 'The pleasure's all mine.' What a well-brought-up boy! </p> <p> Back in London, I immediately ring Victoria Clarke, agog to see what Shane's girlfriend can be like. She says she would love to meet but she's going to some place in Kennington for a five-day residential fast. Next day, however, she rings to say she is having a sauna at her health club in Hampstead and I can join her there. I drive there thinking - sauna, health club, fast - and this is Shane's girlfriend? My jaw actually drops when I met her - she is peachy-skinned and milkmaid-wholesome, as fresh and glowing as a yogurt ad. How can she bear to marry an alky who by his own admission never has a bath? </p> <p>But she doesn't see Shane like that: she thinks he is beautiful. She first met him 20 years ago when she was 15 and 'I thought he was gorgeous. At first I didn't like him as a person - I always fancied him, but thought he was really arrogant. I know he's not conventionally handsome but he is beautiful.' And yes, she confirms, they are getting married as soon as they can get someone to pay. 'I hear Hello! pay to up 500 grand! You've got to get lots of celebrities to come, though, for that.' </p> <p>Gosh, what can I say? I just sit there gawping at her. But hasn't she noticed this, er, problem with Shane? Yes, she says calmly, she knows about alcoholism. She's been to AA and Al Anon (she prefers AA, found Al Anon 'very gloomy'). She thinks Shane could stop drinking if he wanted to - in fact, she says he drinks much less at home than when he's on show - part of his problem is social anxiety, which he covers up with booze. 'But I would hate it if someone said to me, \"You've got to stop drinking.\" I love wine.' </p> <p>In any case, she sympathises with addiction because she suffers it herself - she has a mild addiction to food and a major addiction to fame, and has had therapy for both. But now she plans to cure her fame addiction by hiring herself a publicist - she thinks probably Matthew Freud - to make her famous so she can get it out of her system. 'Because it's one of those things, like with heroin - you've got to try it before you can decide that you're going to give it up.' </p> <p>But doesn't this fame obsession make her relationship with Shane a bit suspect? Doesn't he worry that she might leave him for someone more famous? 'I've already done that. [Apparently she had an affair with Van Morrison.] We've been through it, we've had the affairs, we've had the breakups, we've had the nervous breakdowns. But with me it didn't last - the connection was never strong enough with anyone else - so it must be that I actually genuinely like him more than anyone else. And also we did meet before he was famous.' </p> <p>Shane told me sweetly: 'I would never pretend to understand Victoria - or if I did understand her, I probably wouldn't love her, you know?' I do know. He is so lucky to have the love of a good woman, but at least he knows it - he writes in the foreword to her book, 'God bless the day I found her, and I feel like the luckiest fucker alive.' I hope they get married; I hope they live happily ever after. A few days later I bumped into Sir Bob Geldof at a party and asked him whether he thought Hello! would pay for their wedding. 'Well,' he said, 'I'll pay for it if Hello! won't - I just want to see it happen!' Me too - perhaps we should start a Victoria and Shane Wedding Appeal.

      "bodyText": "Five o'clock, Bloom's Hotel, Dublin. Shane MacGowan tumbles out of the lift into my waiting arms. The photographer and his assistant and I have been waiting since three, with a cheery Irish PR saying, 'Oh, this is nothing - he kept a journalist waiting four hours yesterday!' I want to murder him. We made various sorties to Shane's hotel room but were blocked by a burly man who seemed to be acting as his minder. So on the one hand I am relieved to see Shane at last. On the other hand, I quite want to bundle him back in the lift and forget him. I was prepared for the teeth, the famous blackened stumps, but the suit is an unanticipated horror show, with its thickening patina of stains down the trousers culminating in big blobby spatters on the shoes. If he has not been sick down his trousers several dozen times, he must have a very good stylist. His skin has the shiny pallor of someone who has never seen daylight. He lurches towards the bar. The photographer tries to head him off, saying he wants to do photographs outside before the daylight fades. Shane says, 'Ginantonic' and plonks himself in a chair. I chatter brightly about James Joyce; Shane mumbles unintelligibly; the photographer tears his hair. But eventually, with coaxing from the photographer, the assistant, the PR and me, we get him out into the street. He flinches as the last rays of sunlight hit him and sinks into a doorway - luckily a very photogenic doorway - and the photographer clicks away. Every single person who passes down the street stops and says, 'Shane, good on yer!' or 'How're you doing?' A few bravely rush up and hug him. I didn't realise till then that he is a sort of god in Dublin - or not a god, more a prodigal son. Everyone seems to know him, everyone seems to love him, even little old ladies who surely can't ever have been Pogues fans shake their heads fondly and say, 'Shane! God love you!' After the photographs, we stagger back to the hotel. I remark that the bar is terribly noisy - couldn't we sit somewhere else? Shane says, with sudden furious clarity - 'It's a bar . It's meant to be noisy.' The bar it is then - our home for the next six hours. Of all the Irish bars in all the world, this must be the most thoroughly charmless. It looks like a motorway Travelodge. But it is Shane's bar and no doubt after his death it will be called Shane's Bar - maybe the hotel will be rechristened Shane's Hotel. Gin and tonics begin to appear as if by magic - rows and rows of them filling the table, perhaps materialised by fairy folk because I never see them coming. I start by saying I very much enjoyed his book A Drink with Shane MacGowan - it is one of the freshest, most original biographies I've ever read. It's written as a conversation with his girlfriend, Victoria Mary Clarke, and it's a picture of their relationship as much as of his life. Shane, truculently, mumbles that it's not his book, and he is not happy with it. He doesn't like the title - 'a drink with Shane MacGowan' is not accurate because of course it is many drinks over many years. And then he doesn't like the byline - why is he credited as co-author when it was all Victoria's work? It was just an interview , he insists, just her sometimes switching on the tape recorder when they were talking. And he doesn't 'stand by' anything he is quoted as saying because he might say one thing one day and something else the next. So is he cross with her for writing the book? 'I can't be cross with her ,' he says indignantly, 'I love her!' But he is cross with the book. And with the publishers, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. There is some ongoing saga whereby he claims they agreed to pay his hotel bill and haven't done so. They say they did agree to pay - for two days while he was doing interviews - not the six weeks (and counting) he has stayed there. Anyway, he says ominously that he has not finished cutting the book. The press release claims that it recounts his days as a rent boy in London, but there is nothing about being a rent boy in the book. 'I can't believe you were a rent boy,' I say rudely, 'who would pay to rent you?' 'You'd be surprised,' he says. 'There are women who would climb over their grandmothers to get to a celebrity - Victoria, for instance!' and he emits the first of his exploding coffee-machine laughs. Where is Victoria now? 'Off ligging with U2 in London,' he says. She is Irish but prefers living in London - he prefers Dublin or Tipperary. He was meant to go to the U2 concert but couldn't face travelling to England. Travel must be a serious problem for him - Victoria in the book mentions the hours or even days spent in airports waiting to find a flight willing to take him. Once when he was booked to join Bob Dylan in the States, four flights came and went without him. And yet Victoria is obviously devoted - she calls him Sweet Pea throughout the book. They have been together 15 years, so why haven't they married? 'Because we never had enough celebrities in the same place at the same time.' (This gnomic utterance is later explained by Victoria - they plan to sell their wedding to Hello! or OK!.) 'But we're getting married this year. Hopefully.' And will they start a family? 'I think when we grow up we should [he is 43, she 35] - it's something we've discussed. But probably I'm dropping myself in the shit even talking about it.' His mother told him never to have children till he was rich. He was rich, he made millions with the Pogues, but he says now he's spent it all. 'If you hug money, you clog up the cash flow, know what I mean?' He says he's not destitute - he still gets enough from songwriting royalties to keep him in booze and fags - but he missed out on the rock-star mansions. All he owns is a flat in Gospel Oak which he shares with Victoria, and the old family farm in Tipperary which has no running water. His current group, the Popes, has never achieved success by Pogues standards. Supposing he never makes another record, will he have enough to live on? 'Well,' he sputters, 'I could always open supermarkets!' The wit is quick and comes like a wake-up call to me, reminding me of Bono's remark, 'Shane is more together than people imagine.' (Bono obviously respects him, because he lent him his Martello Tower to live in for a year after the Pogues split up.) Shane's speech may be slurred, his movements uncoordinated, he sometimes gets stuck on saying, 'Know what I mean? Know what I mean? Know what I mean?' till you want to scream - but he is not 'out of it'. On the contrary, he seems to be controlling this interview much better than me. When he doesn't want to answer a question, he ignores it, or mumbles into his G&amp;T. But every time he mentions an Irish name, he spells it out carefully, complete with accents, into my tape recorder. Moreover, unlike me, he remembers everything he says. This was brought sharply home a couple of hours into our conversation when the barman called him over to take a phone call. It was from Victoria and he came back saying, 'You've got to take out that line about her climbing over her grandmother to get to a celebrity. She didn't think it was funny. So take it out, or I'll fucking sue you, right?' (Later, in London, I persuaded Victoria to let me keep it in - she says it's OK because her grandmother is dead - but fancy him remembering.) Shane sees it as his duty to educate me in Irish history, so I'm in for a lot of lecturing about Brian Bor\u00fa, the Black and Tans, Michael Collins, Partition, 'Ireland is a woman', the craic, the whole tear-stained Emerald-Isle package. And yet if you step outside Bloom's Hotel, you can see that Dublin today is just about the glossiest, yuppiest place in Europe - it has such full employment it actually has to import workers. Hasn't Shane noticed? Evidently not. 'I live in the past. It doesn't feel like 2001 to me.' In any case, his Ireland is an entirely personal construct of songs and myths and stories his relatives told him in infancy, ie an Ireland that was probably extinct by the time he was born, if it ever even existed. He has lived in England since he was six - he won a scholarship to Westminster, for heaven's sake! (Admittedly only for a year, but still...) There are people who knew him in his teens who say he didn't have an Irish accent then. But, on the other hand, all his songwriting inspiration comes from Ireland and he achieved his 'crusade' with the Pogues to make Irish music hip and popular, to build Irish self-esteem. In fact, he was one of the founders of the current Irish cultural renaissance - it is just unfortunate that he looks more like a relic of the old pre-boom Ireland of hopeless old pissheads doing zilch. Shane's father 'likes a drink', his uncles, aunts, cousins ditto. Shane claims that when he was a small child in Tipperary, they gave him two Guinnesses a night as his bedtime drink and later, when he was eight, an uncle introduced him to Powers whiskey. He says he never really drew a sober breath after the age of 14. 'In our family it was like, if the kid likes a drink, let him have a drink - because all the kids who weren't allowed to have a drink turned into raging alcoholics.' Mmm, yes, Shane - and...? Even he notices some logical flaw in his argument because he starts sputtering, 'We'd never even heard of alcoholism. We'd have thought it was some kind of weird religion. Our household was an open house where no one was refused, there was a continuous ceilidh going on, people would come from miles around for a drink, 24 hours, there's always one or two people awake.' This was his mother's family's house in Tipperary, where he lived till he was six, while his parents worked in England. He says in the book, 'My life was a happy dream when I was a little boy.' But when he came to live with his parents in London, the picture grows darker and there are glimpses in the book of a deeply dysfunctional family - father out boozing every night, mother lying in bed with arthritis or depression, pilled out of her head, Shane trying to look after his little sister Siobhan. In the book he talks about his mother having a nervous breakdown but now he retracts that and says: 'I was just projecting you know. I was depressed.' When he was 17, he had a major breakdown and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for six months. 'I was drinking a lot and I'd been put on a heavy prescription of tranquillisers by the GP. This was a big thing in the 70s - there's thousands of people in mental hospitals who were made zombies by downers. Anyway, they got me off the gear, the drugs that had put me there, and I started drinking again - but then they wouldn't let me drink, which is where the trouble started. It was called Acute Situational Anxiety - which basically meant I didn't like being in London. Perpetual panic - I panic in London.' Does he panic about performing? 'No, that isn't the panic at all. My family were, are, all singers, performers. No, just sitting in a goddamn bloody flat in bloody London, that's a panic situation. Basically, I've been holding my breath half my fucking life. I can only relax when I'm in Ireland or one or two other places - Thailand, Spain, Japan and certain parts of America. I actually feel physically sick when I think of London.' And yet, Victoria told me later he seemed happy enough living in London till Christmas, but then he went to Dublin for a Popes concert and never came back. He now claims to live in Tipperary, in the old family farmhouse with the sign on the door saying 'Trespassers will be shot'. His parents live in a new house down the road. He describes them as 'very young at heart, intelligent, warm, loving sociopaths!' (Everyone else describes them as 'characters'.) But actually he seems to have been living in Bloom's Hotel, Dublin, since January. What it seems to boil down to is that he feels happy and sociable and safe drinking in Ireland, and depressed and lonely and paranoid drinking in London. But what about not drinking - is that ever a possibility? Yes, he says, 'I don't have to drink.' Victoria took him to the Priory last autumn for a dryout and he says it worked. But, er, what are all these glasses on the table? 'This isn't drinking. We're just having a couple of drinks, you know?' Right. How long did he stay sober after the Priory? 'As long as it took to get to the nearest bar.' So is that his pattern - to dry out, then start drinking again? 'I don't have a pattern. I can't remember from one day to the next.' At one point I said something about his attraction to drink and drugs, and he was suddenly beadily alert. 'What! I'm a drinker. I drink. But drugs, you said - I don't take drugs.' What? Never ? 'So long ago I can't remember.' He should read Victoria's book, then, because it's full of drugs - uppers and downers and acid and cocaine. He once said that by the time the Pogues ended in 1991 he was taking 50 tabs of acid a day - 'You get used to it, you can function on it.' But it has obviously become a touchy subject since November 1999, when Sinead O'Connor shopped him to the police for taking heroin. She told The Sun she went round to his flat and found him practically in a coma on the floor and called the police because 'I love Shane and it makes me angry to see him destroy himself.' He says he was sitting peacefully on the sofa watching a Sam Peckinpah video. Whatever - no police charges were brought. So was he ever on heroin? 'What - addicted to heroin?' Well, on heroin? 'I've tried it a long time ago.' The only drugs he will admit to taking now are prescription tranquillisers - 'If the doctor prescribes them, I take them, and sometimes quite a heavy dose, for stress. But at least I go to a doctor, know what I mean?' Midway through the evening, a man comes into the bar, sees Shane, and rushes over. Shane lurches to his feet and hugs him for a good five minutes. He is Gerry O'Boyle, former owner of Filthy MacNasty's bar in Islington, and they 'go back a long way'. Gerry rustles up a few more G&amp;Ts but, I notice, drinks water. He stays with us for the rest of the evening, and Shane seems happy to have him. Later, when I am drunk as a skunk, Gerry serves the useful purpose of changing the tape when necessary. At some point they decide to teach me how to say a rosary and both whip out their rosaries and an amazing array of medals and scapulas and plastic folders saying: 'I am a Catholic. If I am dying, please call a priest.' Shane says he would certainly want a priest if he were dying. One reason why he likes St John of God - a Dublin drying-out home he sometimes uses - is that it's run by nuns, and priests come round to hear your confession. 'I haven't been to mass for a long time. But I pray every day, every night. I pray all the time. I pray whenever I'm struck by fear and worry, and I pray in gratitude when the release is given to me, you know?' As a Catholic, doesn't he feel bad about not having children? 'I've got children!' How many? 'I don't know. I only know about one. He's a young man. He lives in Scotland. He knows where to get hold of me. I saw him once, when he was three. He knows I'm his father. Years ago, me and Lesley agreed that any time he wanted to come and see me he could come and see me and I'd take him out for a drink, get him whatever he wants. But she married a good man, and he seems to be satisfied with him as his father.' Later in the evening Shane and Gerry announce that they have decided they can trust me, so they will cut me in on the bank robbery they are doing tomorrow. They are driving to a country town, about an hour out of Dublin, and they need a getaway driver. 'She'd be a fucking brilliant driver!' Shane opines. 'She'd be a good driver, yes,' Gerry agrees. 'Well, I don't know. I stop at zebra crossings. I'm rather a slow driver,' I warn them. Both nod eagerly, 'See, if you were a fast driver, it would be very obvious. A slow getaway driver is good!' The evening reels on. Shane sings me ' Woman come in the name of love ' and ends with the plea - 'Can I not convince you to come out with us and rob a bank?' I tell him my husband wouldn't like it and he accepts that - obeying your husband is good. But, he suggests with great delicacy, perhaps my husband will die before me and then I can come out and rob a bank? I promise to think about it. Gerry reminds Shane periodically that there's a party at the Clarence they should go to. 'You come!' Shane orders. 'I haven't got anything to wear,' I whimper - rather a feeble excuse in view of Shane's suit. 'Come as you are,' he says magnanimously. So several hours or aeons later, we stagger into the glossy streets of Temple Bar round to the Clarence, which luckily is only a few yards. Apparently le tout Dublin is there - Candace Bushnell and Marianne Faithfull and two Corrs! But my vision isn't too great by this stage and in a sudden flash of clarity I realise I must go to bed or I will die.

I certainly did not know that I would be spending many months in the compelling company of a woman whose artistic originality was lodged in a battling personality, as if Margaret Thatcher were united with Joan of Arc. </p> <p>A twelfth-century German abbess, it is true, was hardly the obvious non-fiction choice for a bestseller (one can but dream). Yet cult nuns elicit a strange frisson in which fascination combines with distaste, admiration with aversion. Hildegard (1098-1179) is particularly susceptible to such a response. A nun who composed music and who set up her own monastery on the Rhine in the face of strong monkish resistance, who wrote apocalyptic tracts and had lurid, fantastical visions, who chastised popes and emperors and who, as far we can tell, fell in love with another nun, invites trouble. </p> <p>Neglected for some eight centuries, her reappraisal in the 1970s coincided with hippies, feminism, New Age-ism, Greens and, critically, the explosion of interest in early music. Thus, through no fault of her own, Hildegard seemed to meet the criteria for membership of every conceivable special interest group - cranky, outlandish, profane or sacred. Each felt proprietorial about her and adopted her as a mascot, however flimsy their surmise or unfounded their justification. Almost certainly a migraine sufferer, as Oliver Sacks has argued in his study of that affliction, she is unofficial patron saint of the ailment. The St Aelred and St Hildegard Gay and Lesbian Ministry at the Episcopal Church of the Messiah, Santa Ana, California, however, seem to me to push their luck in harnessing her to their cause. Hildegard, in the words of one American feminist fan, sure was 'one tough sister'. Would I be able to understand, stand up to or even stand her? </p> <p>But I was committed. Suddenly my challenge had become clear. For secretly, in my ignorance, I had felt a degree of resistance to her myself. Her name had almost become a clich\u00e9, her reputation summed up over and over again like a mantra in those same CD liner notes - theologian, scientist, musician, artist, prolific correspondent, friend of the twelfth-century high and mighty. The rest was left to scholars poring over obscure medieval Latin texts. Yet even the bare storyline that emerged was amazing and baffling enough, starting with a living death as an anchorite confined to a cell at the age of eight and ending up in old age with international fame and universal notoriety. </p> <p>My only brush with nuns was a year spent at an Ursuline convent in the Italian Alps where I once taught English literature (Beowulf to Virginia Woolf) to young contessas. These nuns, not in the least bit Germanic but straight out of Boccaccio, swigged wine, giggled and eavesdropped. Struggle as I might, I could not make a useful connection across nations or centuries to ease my task. </p> <p>Having assumed that source material would be scarce, my immediate worry was how to verify the existing information about her, some quite audacious. The shock, daunting in itself, was to discover how prolific she was, and how much of her work, including nearly 400 letters, a contemporary biography and several weighty theological tomes, had survived. Sources were often insecure, editions dodgy or abridged. Hundreds of books had been written about her in the past century, examining every aspect of her life and works. </p> <p>Restless, driven and stubborn, Hildegard had a theory on everything, from sexuality and conception (about which she is explicit) to Creation and the cosmos. She founded two monasteries and inspired the painting of extraordinary visionary images. She made encyclopedic studies of fish and fowl, animals and trees. Her writings on health matters, some of the earliest surviving of their kind, have been pounced upon by practitioners of alternative medicine. She analyses the onset and suggests causes for all kinds of disease, from ulcers and depression to cancer in its various recognisable stages. Many of her cures are based on sound medical sense and tally with modern homeopathy. </p> <p>Not all her remedies appeal today (partridge bile mixed with old fat to banish lice; water with a mouse steeped in it to chase off epilepsy), but two German doctors have recently based an entire theory of medicine on her teachings. Health-food addicts, too, have found in her a friend. Her advocacy of spelt, an inferior form of wheat, has stimulated recipe books and food products (pasta, biscuits, cereal, a grim kind of coffee) bearing her name. In addition, our fashionable belief in the efficacy of crystals had an ancient precursor in Hildegard: according to her writings, sapphires cure styes and conjunctivitis as well as quenching lust; chalcedony encourages confident speech; tumours will shrink if rubbed with amethyst. </p> <p>Yet she is best known as a composer which surely, one would think, escapes temporal faddism. That was why I was writing the book, even though I was instructed that it 'should not be a book about chant'. Chant, not my own favoured musical medium, has its ardent supporters. Following the surprise success of a highly specialised CD of Hildegard's music by Christopher Page and Gothic Voices, A Feather on the Breath of God, her cult grew in the 1980s and 1990s. Commerce beckoned. Chanting monks were all the rage. What better than a swung nun? </p> <p>Soon her music reached far beyond concert halls and churches and entered the charts. It was mixed with disco rhythms in that musical no-man's-land known as 'fusion' and played in the discotheques of Ibiza and the bars of Manhattan. But her fame as a composer is new. She did not appear in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians until the 1980 edition. Even those who knew of her compositions had seen no reason to take them seriously. The birth of feminist musicology changed all that. To find that one of the first named composers in the history of Western music was a woman aroused understandable excitement. The question now asked - and this too came as a surprise - is whether Hildegard even wrote the works which bear her name, a subject still hotly debated. Art history still has to engage in a similar debate over the paintings that she seems to have masterminded. </p> <p>If it has taken me a while to acquire a taste for the pure, single vocal line of Hildegard's hymns, my enthusiasm for the period in which it was written - often viewed as a rehearsal for the Renaissance - remains as irrepressible as it is irrational. We all have our foibles. Faced with a Romanesque arch or stone carving my pulse quickens. The chance to immerse myself in an era that witnessed the First and Second Crusade, Abelard and Eloise, The Song of Roland, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, the building of the great Cistercian monasteries and the cathedrals which track the pilgrim routes across Europe, was what made me yearn to engage with Hildegard, one of its liveliest personalities. </p> <p>What else would have possessed me to drag my family to Bingen in the middle of a sodden August in quest of her spirit, if not her footsteps. This sad Rhineland town, flattened by Allied bombing in 1945, has scarcely a pre-war building, let alone a medieval stone still standing. The site of this formidable woman's monastery, the building of which she herself oversaw, is now covered in a Spaghetti Junction of railway lines built partly upon its rubble.

On that day only, her shrouded skull is exposed to the world. Some biographers of the living are lucky enough to have met their subjects.

It is also, in its way, an ethical parable both for our times and and our trade. </p> <p>The homonymous pair first cosied up to each other on the internet. Dave was dubious (he'd been hurt before) but David sent emails which begged: 'Please please please.' Who could resist such raw need, such a flattering lube-job? Dave surrendered. 'You sound like a normal, even warm person,' he whispered down the wire. Within days, David betrayed Dave by blabbing his secretist thoughts. Then, in retaliation, Dave made David's urgent mash notes electronically available to the world at large and kissed off his former confidant as a 'bitter little bastard'. </p> <p>Let me explain. Dave is Dave Eggers, the J.D. Salinger of Generation X, whose tragicomic memoir, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, published last year, just about lived up to its ironically boastful title. David is David Kirkpatrick, a dim hack from the New York Times, who craved an interview with Eggers to coincide with the paperback edition of his book. </p> <p>Dave was wary about meeting in person - you never now what you might catch from personal contact. He agreed to answer questions by email, and David handsomely offered the chance to approve quotes before publication. But by the time the article appeared in mid-February, Dave had decamped from New York to New Zealand. The international dateline, like the hostile astrological signs in Romeo and Juliet, meant he didn't see the proof until too late; just how star-crossed can two buddies be? </p> <p>David's piece was a dull, bland combination of puffery and anodyne tittle-tattle. It could hardly have been anything else, since its instigator was Dave's publisher. The errors were negligible (David got the name of a New Jersey town wrong). Nevertheless, Dave reviled David for hypocrisy and malice, and paid him back by publishing their correspondence - complete with the New York Times man's spelling mistakes - grocers' apostrophes and semi-literate burbling - on a website he edits. </p> <p>Reading through those pages at <a href=\"http://www.mcsweeneys.net\">www.mcsweeneys.net</a> - an online literary journal - I wondered if they gave away rather more about the gladiatorial erotics of literary collaboration and competition than the participants might have wished. 'I'm not married to anything,' hints David, meaning he has no advance notion of what kind of piece he's going to write. He fumbles for a month with an article no longer than the one you are reading, and his incompetence cues a spasm of misogyny: 'I'm having a bitch of a time getting it down.' Then he offers Dave the right of approval, the equivalent of lying face-down on the bed. 'Your willingness to bend is great,' says Dave. In cyberspace, no one has a face, but do I intuit a triumphal smirk from a seducee who pretended to be so hard to get? </p> <p>The bender, however, only pretends submissiveness. Misled, mistreated, Dave finally impugns David's masculinity by claiming online that at weekends he sheds his business suit, wears eyeliner and smokes clove cigarettes. </p> <p>Laughably trivial as it is, the hissy fit raises larger issues about journalistic procedures and the hoity-toity privileges of celebrity. The affair is a labyrinth of double-standards. According to Dave, David, like the far more distinguished Janet Malcolm, a New Yorker profile writer who was sued for breach of confidence and fabrication of quotes by one of her subjects, the psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson - is a 'hatchet-wielder', happy to conceal or alter the truth if it suits his story. Malcolm herself admitted that journalists are instinctively and justifiably treacherous; aren't they entitled to their own artistic licence? And Dave's fulminations, madly excessive given the deferential nature of David's article, somehow miss the point that his own book owed its success to his defiance of the same rules he accuses David of flouting. </p> <p> A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, a non-fiction novel, regaled readers with a mordant account of the deaths of Dave's parents. He now zealously prizes his privacy and will only be interviewed by email. But he thought nothing of publishing the phone numbers of friends who were conscripted as characters in his book. (As it happened, the friends weren't besieged by crank callers; readers assumed the numbers were false.) </p> <p>Dave's mercurial irony evinces a genuine anxiety or distress about his own artistic morality, which battens on disaster and misery and fortuitously makes money from the wreckage of other people's lives. What he sees in David, I think, is a replica of himself - it takes one to know one. Of course, David is a less talented and successful facsimile. You can tell he's not very bright when, checking facts, he asks Dave: 'Are you still 29? Or older now?' </p> <p>In fact, both Dave and David were case-hardened harlots. This was no feckless fling, but a shrewd commercial transaction. Celebrities only give interviews when they have something to sell. Dave was under pressure from his publisher to help them earn back the $1.4 million advance they'd paid him. And David, with cynical candour, conceded during the wooing process that he too had economic reasons for obtaining a commission from the New York Times: 'I have an occupational obligation to try to talk you into talking with me.' </p> <p>What was the value, then, of the fulsome compliments he paid Dave? This was the hooker's unfelt rhetoric of solicitation and encouragement. </p> <p>Dave's chastening of David is not about ethics at all, since morally they're on a par. It's about the supposedly superior rights of the celebrity. Dave's fame exempts him from the customary moral laws, and from emotional qualms that we might otherwise feel about his behaviour. His book turns his family tragedy into a soap opera. Now his angry pedantry about David's inaccuracy is an episode from a sitcom (think of Frasier on the rampage over a lapse of etiquette). </p> <p>Humbling David, he reminds him of what the celebrity is entitled to get away with. Stars possess the power of indifference, a chilling refusal to reciprocate the adoration they're offered; Dave reprints David's emails and also his own non-responses, snubbing the intrusive fan all over again. </p> <p>Nevertheless, in spurning David, Dave has committed an act of hubris. The celebrity is a personality marketed for popular consumption. Dave happens to be a fine writer, but the publicity campaign for the paperback treated him like any other commodity, a product to be exchanged for cash. David, coaxed to write the profile by Dave's publicist, was essential to the selling strategy. </p> <p>This is where Dave's arrogant error comes in. Celebrities are invented by the hacks who celebrate them, and they exist only so long as those cheerleaders maintain public interest in their carryings-on. Princess Diana knew this, and courted the press; her in-laws, fancying themselves above such vulgarity, fatally froze out the photographers and gossip columnists. </p> <p>Dave is now asserting his own proud disconnection from his fan base. The Queen and the reclusive Salinger give no interviews; Dave gives them, if at all, only in cyber-limbo. But where would these aloof creatures be if their names and pictures no longer appeared in the papers? </p> <p>My message to Dave and David is this: guys, get over it. Make up, meet for latte. See if the flame can be rekindled. You depend on each other. More than that, you deserve each other.</p>",

David, coaxed to write the profile by Dave's publicist, was essential to the selling strategy. This is where Dave's arrogant error comes in. Celebrities are invented by the hacks who celebrate them, and they exist only so long as those cheerleaders maintain public interest in their carryings-on. Princess Diana knew this, and courted the press; her in-laws, fancying themselves above such vulgarity, fatally froze out the photographers and gossip columnists. Dave is now asserting his own proud disconnection from his fan base. The Queen and the reclusive Salinger give no interviews; Dave gives them, if at all, only in cyber-limbo. But where would these aloof creatures be if their names and pictures no longer appeared in the papers? My message to Dave and David is this: guys, get over it. Make up, meet for latte. See if the flame can be rekindled. You depend on each other. More than that, you deserve each other.",

Not only are our individual lives haunted by our forthcoming absence, but every work of art - and art, for Steiner, is at once our grand inquisitor and the best way life has come up with of justifying itself - is 'attended by a two-fold shadow: that of its own possible or preferable inexistence, and that of its disappearance'.</p> <p>The phrase 'two-fold shadow' is worth attending to here because it keeps in focus the very difficulty that Steiner is exploring: the way our ideas of creativity and creation (in the theological sense) are ways of countering and acknowledging the absences, the disappearances we have to live with.

      "body": "<p>This column likes to provoke a response, but it has only once received a death threat (from an enraged sci-fi enthusiast). Second only to the science-fiction buffs in prickliness are the devotees of the book club, or reading group. </p> <p>A few years ago, I wrote a lighthearted piece about book clubs, flippantly suggesting that they were a fundamentally American import and that the focus of their interests was - shall we say? - not entirely to do with books. All hell broke loose. Round robins were drafted; letters were signed; retractions demanded. My long-suffering wife was obliged to pretend that divorce papers were in the post. I made a pact with myself to leave the subject well alone for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>Today, I am breaking that vow, and I am doing so chiefly because I was 100 per cent wrong. Reading groups are not a passing fad or fancy. They are not just a girls' night out. They have become an essential part of civilised life up and down the country. So much so, indeed, that savvy publishers like Random House and HarperCollins now issue reading guides (available free at most bookshops) as a way of promoting an interest in their backlists. </p> <p>What's more, this holds good internationally; today, book clubs are flourishing from Spain to Singapore. In America, where the idea originated in the aftermath of the women's liberation movement, you will find book clubs up and down east and west coasts. The online magazine Slate also has a weekly online book club initiated by journalists, to which the reading public contributes. Oprah Winfrey's celebrated TV show features a reading group segment, whose capacity to create overnight bestsellers has been widely reported. </p> <p>These literary lightning strikes are all very well. In fact, the appeal of the book club is precisely its indifference to hype, and the warmth of its embrace of the solitary, the bored and the independent-minded. In a jangling, culturally overloaded time, the book club is a riposte to big- city anomie and the relentless, atomising pressure of modern life, as well as the yuppy answer to that old complaint: 'I just don't get time to read any more.' </p> <p>Proof, if proof were needed, that this phenomenon has finally arrived comes this week with the publication of Jenny Hartley's survey, Reading Groups (OUP \u00a35.99, pp198). This fascinating study inevitably reinforces some of the conventional wisdom about reading groups, a movement that numbers some 50,000 in the UK. For instance, 69 per cent of the 350 groups surveyed across the United Kingdom are indeed all-female (only 4 per cent are all-male). The reported reasons for this ranged from: 'We can't find any men who read' and: 'Men don't seem to enjoy the process of discussion as much' to: 'We felt the men would dominate... and the women would slide into the background and make the tea.' </p> <p>More surprisingly, Dr Hartley's research reveals that about a fifth of all groups has been running for more than 10 years; that they can be found in schools, pubs, libraries, even a zoo; that some groups only meet via their computer screens and that one group dates back to 1799. The Bristol Friendly Reading Society takes us back to the sober, self-improving ethos of the early nineteenth century. It's also a reminder that, as recently as 100 years ago, the Victorian working-men's clubs were offering a proto-reading group experience. Similarly, the women's suffrage movement derived much of its initial strength from the reading groups of the day. </p> <p>Dr Hartley, who is evangelical about her subject, demonstrates that there's a strong drive among reading group members to fight complacency. Consciousness-raising is an important part of the book group's appeal. Not surprisingly, some respondents to her survey reported 'shouting matches and power struggles' over the choice of the week's book, together with a general fear of 'long and heavy' classics such as The Brothers Karamazov and Tristram Shandy. Unlike those classics, the books enjoyed by the clubs of the nineteenth century are now long forgotten. </p> <p>It's odd, and slightly chilling, to think that the same fate almost certainly awaits the writers whom Ms Hartley reports to be 'most read' by the groups she surveyed: Louis de Berni\u00e8res, Anne Tyler, Jane Smiley, Pat Barker, Frank McCourt, Beryl Bainbridge, Arundhati Roy, Sebastian Faulks and Margaret Atwood. </p> <p>Dr Hartley's list implicitly challenges those who have bewailed the 'dumbing down' of our culture by the pressures of rival media - video, TV and the internet. But it also confirms that, if there's one kind of book the British reading public favours over all others, it's a novel, preferably in the English language, and ideally by a woman. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Read your books letters online at <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/review\">www.observer.co.uk/review</a></p>",

I made a pact with myself to leave the subject well alone for the foreseeable future. Today, I am breaking that vow, and I am doing so chiefly because I was 100 per cent wrong. Reading groups are not a passing fad or fancy. They are not just a girls' night out. They have become an essential part of civilised life up and down the country. So much so, indeed, that savvy publishers like Random House and HarperCollins now issue reading guides (available free at most bookshops) as a way of promoting an interest in their backlists. What's more, this holds good internationally; today, book clubs are flourishing from Spain to Singapore. In America, where the idea originated in the aftermath of the women's liberation movement, you will find book clubs up and down east and west coasts. The online magazine Slate also has a weekly online book club initiated by journalists, to which the reading public contributes. Oprah Winfrey's celebrated TV show features a reading group segment, whose capacity to create overnight bestsellers has been widely reported. These literary lightning strikes are all very well. In fact, the appeal of the book club is precisely its indifference to hype, and the warmth of its embrace of the solitary, the bored and the independent-minded. In a jangling, culturally overloaded time, the book club is a riposte to big- city anomie and the relentless, atomising pressure of modern life, as well as the yuppy answer to that old complaint: 'I just don't get time to read any more.' Proof, if proof were needed, that this phenomenon has finally arrived comes this week with the publication of Jenny Hartley's survey, Reading Groups (OUP \u00a35.99, pp198). This fascinating study inevitably reinforces some of the conventional wisdom about reading groups, a movement that numbers some 50,000 in the UK. For instance, 69 per cent of the 350 groups surveyed across the United Kingdom are indeed all-female (only 4 per cent are all-male). The reported reasons for this ranged from: 'We can't find any men who read' and: 'Men don't seem to enjoy the process of discussion as much' to: 'We felt the men would dominate... and the women would slide into the background and make the tea.' More surprisingly, Dr Hartley's research reveals that about a fifth of all groups has been running for more than 10 years; that they can be found in schools, pubs, libraries, even a zoo; that some groups only meet via their computer screens and that one group dates back to 1799. The Bristol Friendly Reading Society takes us back to the sober, self-improving ethos of the early nineteenth century. It's also a reminder that, as recently as 100 years ago, the Victorian working-men's clubs were offering a proto-reading group experience. Similarly, the women's suffrage movement derived much of its initial strength from the reading groups of the day. Dr Hartley, who is evangelical about her subject, demonstrates that there's a strong drive among reading group members to fight complacency. Consciousness-raising is an important part of the book group's appeal. Not surprisingly, some respondents to her survey reported 'shouting matches and power struggles' over the choice of the week's book, together with a general fear of 'long and heavy' classics such as The Brothers Karamazov and Tristram Shandy. Unlike those classics, the books enjoyed by the clubs of the nineteenth century are now long forgotten. It's odd, and slightly chilling, to think that the same fate almost certainly awaits the writers whom Ms Hartley reports to be 'most read' by the groups she surveyed: Louis de Berni\u00e8res, Anne Tyler, Jane Smiley, Pat Barker, Frank McCourt, Beryl Bainbridge, Arundhati Roy, Sebastian Faulks and Margaret Atwood. Dr Hartley's list implicitly challenges those who have bewailed the 'dumbing down' of our culture by the pressures of rival media - video, TV and the internet. But it also confirms that, if there's one kind of book the British reading public favours over all others, it's a novel, preferably in the English language, and ideally by a woman. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk \u0095 Read your books letters online at www.observer.co.uk/review",

They appear to disclose themselves to the viewer, utterly and without qualification. What indeed could be more self-evident than the markings on a canvas, exposed on a wall to our closest scrutiny? And yet they contain mysteries. That they do so is not generally assumed, however. While literary works are assumed to be opaque, difficult - a whole school of criticism emerged in the early twentieth century dedicated solely to the investigation of poetry's ambiguities - pictures are taken to be transparent, accessible, readily intelligible. </p> <p>So while it is conceded that literary critics, successors to interpreters of the Bible, do a necessary job, art critics have a somewhat harder time making a case for their profession. Many do not even try to make that case, but Alberto Manguel, though not a professional art critic, is persuaded that pictures need interpreters and in Reading Pictures he sets out to explain why. </p> <p>Manguel is the celebrated author of A History of Reading and his point of departure is, inevitably, the written word. His opening move is to treat pictures as stories. They reveal their mysteries, that is to say, by being treated as texts. 'Much as I love reading words,' says Manguel, 'I also love reading pictures, and I enjoy finding the stories woven into them.' These are not just the stories told by the pictures but the stories that can be told about them and also about their creators. </p> <p>Manguel's book itself is woven out of stories. It is a text about images that treats images as texts. The book is resolutely anti-professional, but not philistine. Manguel explains that he has not attempted to devise a systematic method for reading pictures such as those proposed by great art historians. He is guided not by a theory of art but by curiosity. His book grew out of the need to reclaim for common viewers the right to 'read' images. As he says: 'When we try to read a painting, it may seem lost to us in an abyss of misunderstanding or, if we prefer, a vast no-man's abyss of multiple interpretations.' </p> <p>His task is to retrieve paintings from these depths. And so, for example, in one chapter, 'The Image as Riddle', he unravels the complexities of Christian iconography, illuminating a number of images of mothers nursing their infant children, pictures that withhold their complexities by the surface simplicity of their subject. </p> <p>Following no conventional classification, Manguel organises pictures into 12 kinds. He writes about them as: story; absence; riddle; witness; understanding; nightmare; reflection; violence; subversion; philosophy; memory; theatre. A chapter is devoted to each. These are not, I think, hard and fast categories for him. Indeed, many are not categories at all. He would concede that many of the works that he considers could also fit in several other chapters. His approach is entirely pragmatic. Long after his thesis has been forgotten, the memory will persist of his smoothly deployed learning. </p> <p>Manguel writes especially well about photography, noting that it allows, perhaps more than any other art, for manipulation and censorship to become an integral part of its own creative process. A piece of writing or a sculpture, he points out, may well suppress information, but such works define themselves as subjective, and thus accept their own fictions; photography is different. It purports to communicate what was there at the time of record and so it can lie. The artist deals in fictions; the photographer trades in the higher currency of truth. And this has a great many consequences for the development of art in the twentieth century because, as Manguel says, photography was undeniably that century's 'emblematic art form'. </p> <p>This leads Manguel into a discussion of the career of Edward Weston who, in his attempt to 'see' his subject with the least possible interference, refused to crop his final prints. But, as Manguel goes on to note, this commitment to the 'truth' can become addictive and lead to the abandonment of art - photography, even - altogether. This was the fate of the artist Tina Modotti who gave up photography because seeing and portraying the social reality of Mexico's poor was too mediated a form of witness. She had to get much closer than her camera would allow and so she retreated into artistic silence. </p> <p>This book is in a line of works of eccentric scholarship: Pliny the Elder's Natural History (the founding work of the genre), Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, Isaac D'Israeli's Curiosities of Literature. In this kind of work, wide and eclectic reading is put at the service of a large thesis, one which is not so rigorous as to exclude the entertaining anecdote or the curious fact. (Manguel pays homage to his master Pliny in his chapter 'The Image as Witness'.) The book is thus midway between a treatise and a book of quotations. It is too personal, too idiosyncratic, to be either the one or the other.</p> <p>Part of the pleasure to be taken in Manguel's work (every one of his books, indeed) is in his retrieval of obscure aphorisms; the other part is his ability to give these aphorisms a context. So he quotes Beckett: 'To restore silence is the role of objects', which is a wonderfully taciturn statement in itself, and he uses it as the epigraph to his opening chapter, on the image as 'absence'. </p> <p>In a concluding chapter of great modesty, he lists his omissions: prehistoric art, the arcane pictorial vocabulary of the renaissance, the political iconography of the nineteenth century, the arts of graffiti, of installations, of fashion, of pornography, of madness and dreams, of billboards and neon lights. The list puzzles - what exactly is the art of dreams? - but this only adds to its charm.

      "body": "<p><strong>Arthur the Dragon King: the Barbarian Roots of Britain's Greatest Legend</strong><br>Howard Reid<br>Headline, \u00a318.99, pp255<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000437932,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>In the opening pages of this book, the author makes one of his least controversial assertions: 'A vast amount of material of very variable quality has poured forth over the centuries about King Arthur.' How very true. </p> <p>The difficulty in writing about Arthur is that nothing is known of him. He is not referred to at all in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. The very first mention of his name comes in a passing observation by a late sixth-century Welsh poet, who remarks that a certain warrior, though brave, 'was not Arthur'. Three centuries later, a monk called Nennius provides an outline of Arthur's life, though he admits that his sources are a rag-bag compilation. </p> <p>The most famous subsequent account is Malory's Morte D'Arthur, which gives us the familiar details of the knights of the Round Table, the doomed love of Lancelot and Guinevere, the quest for the Holy Grail, etc. In considering this as a historical document, however, we should bear in mind that it was written perhaps 1,000 years after the events it purports to describe. </p> <p>The subject of Arthur is therefore wide open to speculation, and plenty of speculation there has been. Arthur was a Briton, or perhaps a Celt resisting the Romans; no, he was a Roman fighting off barbarians; on the contrary, he was an Anglo-Saxon, perhaps driving back the Norsemen, and so on. Welsh writers have argued that Arthur was a Welshman, Scottish writers that he was a Scot and French writers that he was French. Since nothing is known about him, almost anything can be said and almost everything has been. </p> <p>Now Howard Reid, a documentary filmmaker, has come along with a new theory: Arthur came from one of the nomadic tribes attacking the declining Roman Empire from the east. These were not Huns, Vandals or Goths, but the less familiar Alans, tall, blond tourists arriving in Europe by horse. </p> <p>He comes from, well, we're not quite sure where until the very end of the book, though Reid drops various hints that Arthur's home may have been somewhere around the Caucasus. </p> <p>This startling notion is founded on the author's comparison of the Arthurian legend as it has come down to us, in particular, the idea of warriors on horseback,with the few facts that are known of the peoples around when Arthur was supposed to have lived. 'It is impossible for any of us to imagine an Arthur who has to dismount before doing battle,' the author proclaims. Right, so Arthur can't have been a Celt. The trouble with this method is that it involves projecting back in time elements of the Arthurian legend, such as chivalry and courtly love, that are almost certainly later embellishments. It is like trying to build a house by starting with the roof. </p> <p>Reid's argument is scattered with phrases such as 'may well have been', 'almost inconceivable', 'seems entirely in keeping with,' and - my favourite - 'it is surely not too great a step to go on to...' Evidence being scarce, he is forced to use any that he can find, referring, for example, to 'eunuchs and castration', both of course, Arthurian themes. Just run that one past me again, will you, Howard? </p> <p>His text does not seem to have been sullied by the attention of an editor. The same facts are trotted out again and again, as if for the first time, often word-for-word as before. One howler I particularly enjoyed was the use of 'populous' to mean 'populace'. </p> <p>In the search for Arthur, Howard Reid takes us ever further east, daringly roaming across two continents and three millennia. Barbarian wave follows barbarian wave; armies, kings and warriors flash past at bewildering speed. The author tries to keep the reader's attention with his lively prose, but towards the finish even he tires: 'History, however, was rushing on and in 451 the Romans were once again calling on the Alans to aid them in their hour of need.' </p> <p>He saves his most astounding conclusion until the very end. Perhaps Arthur was not an Alan after all? Once all the pieces in the jigsaw have been placed in the correct position, we can see that the real King Arthur may have been - remember, reader, you saw it here first - Japanese.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Arthur the Dragon King: the Barbarian Roots of Britain's Greatest Legend Howard Reid Headline, \u00a318.99, pp255 Buy it at a discount at BOL In the opening pages of this book, the author makes one of his least controversial assertions: 'A vast amount of material of very variable quality has poured forth over the centuries about King Arthur.' How very true. The difficulty in writing about Arthur is that nothing is known of him. He is not referred to at all in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles. The very first mention of his name comes in a passing observation by a late sixth-century Welsh poet, who remarks that a certain warrior, though brave, 'was not Arthur'. Three centuries later, a monk called Nennius provides an outline of Arthur's life, though he admits that his sources are a rag-bag compilation. The most famous subsequent account is Malory's Morte D'Arthur, which gives us the familiar details of the knights of the Round Table, the doomed love of Lancelot and Guinevere, the quest for the Holy Grail, etc. In considering this as a historical document, however, we should bear in mind that it was written perhaps 1,000 years after the events it purports to describe. The subject of Arthur is therefore wide open to speculation, and plenty of speculation there has been. Arthur was a Briton, or perhaps a Celt resisting the Romans; no, he was a Roman fighting off barbarians; on the contrary, he was an Anglo-Saxon, perhaps driving back the Norsemen, and so on. Welsh writers have argued that Arthur was a Welshman, Scottish writers that he was a Scot and French writers that he was French. Since nothing is known about him, almost anything can be said and almost everything has been. Now Howard Reid, a documentary filmmaker, has come along with a new theory: Arthur came from one of the nomadic tribes attacking the declining Roman Empire from the east. These were not Huns, Vandals or Goths, but the less familiar Alans, tall, blond tourists arriving in Europe by horse. He comes from, well, we're not quite sure where until the very end of the book, though Reid drops various hints that Arthur's home may have been somewhere around the Caucasus. This startling notion is founded on the author's comparison of the Arthurian legend as it has come down to us, in particular, the idea of warriors on horseback,with the few facts that are known of the peoples around when Arthur was supposed to have lived. 'It is impossible for any of us to imagine an Arthur who has to dismount before doing battle,' the author proclaims. Right, so Arthur can't have been a Celt. The trouble with this method is that it involves projecting back in time elements of the Arthurian legend, such as chivalry and courtly love, that are almost certainly later embellishments. It is like trying to build a house by starting with the roof. Reid's argument is scattered with phrases such as 'may well have been', 'almost inconceivable', 'seems entirely in keeping with,' and - my favourite - 'it is surely not too great a step to go on to...' Evidence being scarce, he is forced to use any that he can find, referring, for example, to 'eunuchs and castration', both of course, Arthurian themes. Just run that one past me again, will you, Howard? His text does not seem to have been sullied by the attention of an editor. The same facts are trotted out again and again, as if for the first time, often word-for-word as before. One howler I particularly enjoyed was the use of 'populous' to mean 'populace'. In the search for Arthur, Howard Reid takes us ever further east, daringly roaming across two continents and three millennia. Barbarian wave follows barbarian wave; armies, kings and warriors flash past at bewildering speed. The author tries to keep the reader's attention with his lively prose, but towards the finish even he tires: 'History, however, was rushing on and in 451 the Romans were once again calling on the Alans to aid them in their hour of need.' He saves his most astounding conclusion until the very end. Perhaps Arthur was not an Alan after all? Once all the pieces in the jigsaw have been placed in the correct position, we can see that the real King Arthur may have been - remember, reader, you saw it here first - Japanese.",

The characters' names - Ydlbert von Iggislau, Ion Gansev\u00f6ort - are a mongrel blend of pseudo-Flemish, Old Testament and Brothers Grimm, and the life Yves presents is a bleak one, of rudimentary farming, hostile elements, superstition, devout religion and fear of pestilence, all of which contribute to the medieval flavour. </p> <p>Yet it gradually becomes apparent that the story is set in the present, and that Yves's village of Mandragora is a quite real but forgotten community, nestling on an unnamed island off the coast of Scotland which is marked on no map and has entertained no foreigners since the time of Yves's grandmother (provoking pedantic questions about the origin of their European names, English dialect and where they might have learned the phrase 'Piss off'). Ruth Blum, an anthropology student, arrives in this lost, pre-industrial hamlet and is invited into Yves's home while she studies the villagers, whose suspicions of her 'witchcraft' fester as the modern world begins to intrude in her wake. </p> <p>The strangeness and originality of the world Barton has created make the novel difficult to accept at first. Yves's cod-Shakespearean voice appears over-egged, but as the reader becomes acclimatised to the language, the gradual accumulation of detail - of farming practices, weaving and cooking, the personalities and feuds of the village's families - builds an absorbing picture of a self-contained and almost fantastical country with its own lore. </p> <p>The novel is also a fairly obvious parable about the development of technology as a mixed blessing. Though the villagers endure hardships, they also enjoy simple pleasures and an innocent community with one another and with the land, which is threatened as Yves's inventions grow more ambitious and the desire for greater productivity increases. The careful grafting of Ruth Blum's story on to Yves's own, and the eventual uniting of these two complementary threads, is tenderly and affectionately worked out, and the novel champions the idea of an essential shared humanity that can bridge extreme cultural divides. </p> <p> The Testament of Yves Gundron is an impressive work of imagination, bewitching, pertinent and yet, like the best parables, seemingly timeless.</p>",

These issues are worthy of investigation, though the investment industry will argue that competition and government initiatives such as capping of charges on stakeholder pensions, product benchmarking through the Catmark system, and educational initiatives by the Financial Services Authority, are helping to cut charges. But change has come slowly, and many people are still buying unsuitable products. Further scrutiny of the industry will only pay off, however, if the Government has the stomach to face deep-rooted problems in the business. The main one is commission, the traditional method of payment for financial 'advisers'. So far, the Government has shown no enthusiasm for outlawing this, preferring blunt instruments such as the capping of charges on stakeholder pensions and attempts at improving information for consumers. Further investigation of these industries is warranted, but it will be worthwhile only if the Government is prepared for a real showdown. Education is one of the ways in which the Government, through the Financial Services Authority, believes consumers will become better equipped to avoid being fleeced. The FSA is encouraged by a survey showing that 11-to-16-year-olds are more interested in learning about money than about sex - hoping this shows enthusiasm for personal finance as a school subject. A more likely explanation is that these pupils already know plenty about sex. And while they may be interested in money, the mind-boggling complexity of Britain's financial services system means that many aspects of it will remain beyond the ken of educators and students alike. If regulators hope education will allow them to exert a lighter touch, they will have a long wait.",

But while these may not have gone up over the four years - indeed the basic rate is down from 23 to 22 per cent - the Government is collecting more tax than in 1997. </p> <p>Revenues can rise for reasons other than individuals having to pay more. But there is a consensus among analysts that some of us really are handing over a greater proportion of our incomes than we did. </p> <p>The winners have been poorer families and elderly people. The losers are middle-income earners, particularly the childless, although their pain has probably been masked by a healthy economy and pay rises. </p> <p>The difference between old Labour and new is the way that we are taxed. Gordon Brown has withdrawn various reliefs such as mortgage interest, the Married Couple's Allowance - only partially restored by the new Children's Tax Credit - and increased the cost of paying for a private pension by taxing pension funds. </p> <p>Parents may even see the full withdrawal of student grants under Labour and the arrival of tuition fees as back-door taxation. </p> <p>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies is analysing the full effects of five Labour Budgets, including last week's, but researcher Michal Myck says: 'The general picture is easy to formulate - lower-income families with children have certainly gained. Pensioners have gained substantially.' </p> <p>But while the Conservatives are keen to promote the idea that middle England has been hit by a slew of 'stealth' taxes, the institute suggests this is an over-simplification. </p> <p>The effect of Brown's changes vary greatly according to individual circumstances. For example, a single taxpayer without a mortgage gained from cuts in direct taxes, mainly income tax. Scrapping mortgage interest tax relief has hit all homeowners with loans. Smokers and car owners lost out as a result of big increases in duties. </p> <p>An analysis carried out before last week's Budget, which took into account changes in direct and indirect taxation, showed that the poorest 10 per cent of households were, on average, 8.8 per cent better off from all the measures introduced after May 1997. </p> <p>'Further deciles gain proportionately less on average, and the richest 30 per cent of households experience a fall in post-tax income once all the reforms are considered,' said the IFS. </p> <p>The poorer households gain mainly from increases in benefits for those out of work and the introduction of the Working Families' Tax Credit for those in work.The loss of income for richer households comes from rises in National Insurance and the abolition of mortgage tax relief and the Married Couple's Allowance. </p> <p>However, within most income groups, even the poorest, there are losers as well as winners. Among the poorest 10 per cent, for example, 2.9 per cent were more than \u00a310 a week worse off. Among the richest, 1.7 per cent were more than \u00a310 a week better off. </p> <p>Two-earner couples with children gain less than other types of families with children as they are least likely to benefit from the Working Families' Tax Credit and income support allowances, and are most likely to see the Children's Tax Credit withdrawn. Non-earning couples with children gain most: on average, \u00a318.70 per week. </p> <p>According to the IFS's initial conclusions about the overall effect of last week's measures, the position of people towards the top end of the income scale - but not the wealthiest 10 per cent - will have improved. </p> <p>The improvement to pensioners' incomes results from increased age-related income tax allowances, increased income support, winter fuel allowances and retention of the Married Couple's Allowance for those born before 6 April 1935. On average, a single pensioner household has gained \u00a36.10 and a pensioner couple \u00a34.20 a week. </p> <p>Despite the obvious efforts the Chancellor has made to redirect resources, there are concerns about some of his set-piece changes. A strong theme has been a move towards increased means-testing, particularly for pensioners. The institute reckons that by 2003 the average single pensioner will gain \u00a39.68 a week from the package of measures foreshadowed by the Chancellor in his November 2000 Pre-Budget Report, and confirmed last week. </p> <p>The average couple should pocket \u00a311.05. The extra money comes from above-inflation rises in the basic state pension in 2001 and 2002; above-inflation rises in the means-tested Minimum Income Guarantee - which tops up the basic state pension in low-income pensioner households - in each of the next three years and, from April 2003, the new pension credit, designed to reward saving for poorer pensioners. </p> <p>By 2003 the average incomes of the poorest 10 per cent of pensioners should be up by more than 20 per cent, according to the IFS. </p> <p>Its researcher, Tom Clark, says: 'The Government is diverting significant extra resources to pensioners. But its basic strategy is still to extend means-testing.' The IFS fears that this could discourage younger people from saving. </p> <p>This view is supported by an Institute of Actuaries analysis, which concludes that means-testing leads to people who reach retirement with small savings having to pay high marginal tax rates. It also discriminates against women, because they are less inclined to claim for their entitlements yet are among the poorest pensioners. </p> <p>The actuaries conclude that means-testing and the poorer returns likely on money put aside for old age are 'likely to make saving for a pension considerably less attractive for increasing numbers of people'. </p> <p>They suggest that a higher basic state pension may be preferable to means-testing, as it would do more to encourage saving. </p> <p>The charity Age Concern, long opposed to means-testing, is continuing to campaign for a substantial increase in the basic state pension, and for it to go up in line with average earnings, rather than prices. </p> <p>There is concern, too, that reforms aimed at low-income families are missing their tar get. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has criticised the Working Families Tax Credit, pointing out that some employers are refusing to employ people entitled to it because of the high cost of the the bureaucracy involved in paying the money. In one case a single parent was dismissed from her part-time job when WFTC had to be paid through her pay packet. </p> <p>Parents complain that once they receive the benefit it means they lose free school meals and help with rent and council tax. </p> <p>The Government's emphasis on lower-income groups seemed to be called into question 24 hours after last week's Budget by a report into poverty across Europe, which found that more than 5 million Britons are living at levels thought to exist only in the developing world. </p> <p>But poverty is concentrated among lone parents, where households may have missed out on the work-ori ented means-tested benefits Labour has introduced. </p> <p>Despite the shortcomings of some of these changes, their general thrust has been welcomed by the Child Poverty Action Group. Its director, Martin Barnes, says: 'In the last two years we have seen a fairly significant shift in resources towards poorer families with children.' </p> <p>Even if the Conservatives' claims about stealth taxes are exaggerated, there has been some pain for Middle England. Around 20 per cent more people are paying income tax at the 40 per cent tax rate now than when Labour came to office. This is mainly because earnings have risen more quickly than the higher-rate threshold. </p> <p>Accountant PricewaterhouseCooper points out that the starting rate is now barely one and a half times' average earnings. </p> <p>From the new tax year, someone earning just under \u00a334,000 will be a higher-rate taxpayer. Yet an income like this probably wouldn't support a mortgage large enough for a flat in London; financial well-being isn't just about tax. </p> <p>Ian Brinkley, senior economist at the Trades Union Congress, says that, for the moment, means-testing is extending far enough up the income scale - higher rate taxpayers can get the Children's Tax Credit, for example - for it not to have become offensive. </p> <p>But Brinkley says: 'If you don't have universality [of benefits] will the middle classes get fed up? Will higher-rate taxpayers say, \"Enough is enough. Why should I pay for universal benefits which I can't get?\"' </p> <p>Middle England, as repre sented by teachers, nurses, policemen and other members of the salaried classes, may begin to wonder why people much higher up the income scale are being left relatively unscathed. </p> <p>Labour has not so far targeted the super-rich. Despite long-running rumours that such moves were coming, there has been no move to cut back on inheritance tax breaks, or higher rate relief on pension contributions. Such moves could, of course, upset the moderately well off as much as the super-rich. </p> <p>Patrick Stevens, tax partner at accountant Ernst &amp; Young, agrees that a disproportionate amount of pain is probably being felt by people in the \u00a312,000 to \u00a330,000 a year income bracket.

      "body": "<p>He can be very stimulating and amusing when he wants to be, but Gordon Brown has resoundingly succeeded in his self-imposed task of boring the country into submission. The Chancellor surpassed himself in last week's Budget speech, setting records for the sheer speed of his delivery of worthy but tedious measures, many of which belonged in written technical annexes. </p> <p>It all reminded one of Beachcomber's List of Huntingdonshire Cabmen. Only the latter seems in retrospect to have had a certain air of excitement about it. A Roy Jenkins or a Nigel Lawson would have choked with laughter as detail followed detail. Perhaps in retirement the Chancellor should go on the stage and give readings from Yellow Pages. </p> <p>It may be one's imagination, but the general impression is that much of the sense of occasion has disappeared from the Budget. Indeed, it was difficult to find people last Wednesday who knew there was going to be a Budget at all. Perhaps this was all part of the Chancellor's long-term strategy: it may be that the goal of elimination of the 'boom and bust' requires the elimination of the Budget itself. It is, after all, the Budget ritual which most reminds people of past booms and busts. </p> <p>The Chancellor has got the art of repeating measures and phrases down to a fine art. By reiterating 'stability', 'a balanced approach' and 'the need to avoid boom and bust' he has perfected the political art of not answering any question that is inconvenient. It is a breathtakingly successful technique, and Brown seldom stops for breath when answering, or not answering, questions. </p> <p>The 'balanced approach' - of public spending increases but also tax cuts - is confirmation that, even now, the Government is only frolicking in the margins of any plan it may have to alter the ground rules it inherited after 18 years in the wilderness. There is no sign of any major attempt to raise tax and spending plans to continental levels. </p> <p>Labour's recent conversion to the cause of higher public sector investment in education, health and transport is certainly welcome; but it comes terribly late.

      "bodyText": "He can be very stimulating and amusing when he wants to be, but Gordon Brown has resoundingly succeeded in his self-imposed task of boring the country into submission. The Chancellor surpassed himself in last week's Budget speech, setting records for the sheer speed of his delivery of worthy but tedious measures, many of which belonged in written technical annexes. It all reminded one of Beachcomber's List of Huntingdonshire Cabmen. Only the latter seems in retrospect to have had a certain air of excitement about it. A Roy Jenkins or a Nigel Lawson would have choked with laughter as detail followed detail. Perhaps in retirement the Chancellor should go on the stage and give readings from Yellow Pages. It may be one's imagination, but the general impression is that much of the sense of occasion has disappeared from the Budget. Indeed, it was difficult to find people last Wednesday who knew there was going to be a Budget at all. Perhaps this was all part of the Chancellor's long-term strategy: it may be that the goal of elimination of the 'boom and bust' requires the elimination of the Budget itself. It is, after all, the Budget ritual which most reminds people of past booms and busts. The Chancellor has got the art of repeating measures and phrases down to a fine art. By reiterating 'stability', 'a balanced approach' and 'the need to avoid boom and bust' he has perfected the political art of not answering any question that is inconvenient. It is a breathtakingly successful technique, and Brown seldom stops for breath when answering, or not answering, questions. The 'balanced approach' - of public spending increases but also tax cuts - is confirmation that, even now, the Government is only frolicking in the margins of any plan it may have to alter the ground rules it inherited after 18 years in the wilderness. There is no sign of any major attempt to raise tax and spending plans to continental levels. Labour's recent conversion to the cause of higher public sector investment in education, health and transport is certainly welcome; but it comes terribly late. The Government has wasted most of its first term summoning up courage to do the things it was elected for in 1997. This is an awfully long time.

Inflation is negligible, thanks in part to his early delegation of responsibility for interest rates to the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee. The proportion of the adult population in work is well above the EU average. Economic stability has replaced the stop-go cycles of the past 50 years. </p> <p>The UK ranks among the top handful of economies in terms of how its market-friendly policies have affected economic outcomes. By most measures, it is just behind the US and way ahead of Germany or France. Its product markets are the least regulated of all the economies in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, compared with sixth place for Germany and fourteenth for France. </p> <p>The Fraser Institute's index of 'economic freedom' ranks the UK in fifth place (Germany 22, France 24) and the Heritage Foundation's equivalent puts it seventh in the world (Germany 20, France 39). It is easier to form a new business in the UK than in almost any other advanced country. </p> <p>You may have thought that the combination of macro-stability and 'supply side' reforms would have put the UK among the top advanced countries in productivity and standards of living. At a minimum, the reforms of the past two decades should have lifted the country in the league tables of output per head and per person. But it has not. </p> <p>In 1980, before Margaret Thatcher started her programme of pro-free market reforms, the UK was ranked number 15 among advanced countries in per capita GDP.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown justifiably proud of his prudent stewardship of the British economy when he presented his pre-election Budget last week. The Government's achievements are real. Inflation is negligible, thanks in part to his early delegation of responsibility for interest rates to the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee. The proportion of the adult population in work is well above the EU average. Economic stability has replaced the stop-go cycles of the past 50 years. The UK ranks among the top handful of economies in terms of how its market-friendly policies have affected economic outcomes. By most measures, it is just behind the US and way ahead of Germany or France. Its product markets are the least regulated of all the economies in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, compared with sixth place for Germany and fourteenth for France. The Fraser Institute's index of 'economic freedom' ranks the UK in fifth place (Germany 22, France 24) and the Heritage Foundation's equivalent puts it seventh in the world (Germany 20, France 39). It is easier to form a new business in the UK than in almost any other advanced country. You may have thought that the combination of macro-stability and 'supply side' reforms would have put the UK among the top advanced countries in productivity and standards of living. At a minimum, the reforms of the past two decades should have lifted the country in the league tables of output per head and per person. But it has not. In 1980, before Margaret Thatcher started her programme of pro-free market reforms, the UK was ranked number 15 among advanced countries in per capita GDP. Twenty years later it was at 17. Productivity per employee and per hour are still 20-30 per cent below the US, Germany, or France. GDP per employee is 26 years behind the US, 12 years behind France, and nine years behind Germany. The UK is no longer falling behind these countries, but it has barely gained on them. So the big economic question Brown has to face is what can be done to close the productivity gap and create an economy where living standards can rise more rapidly. A policy that relies on still more liberation of market forces - more privatisation, more market deregulation, yet lower tax rates - is unlikely to do the trick for two reasons. First, so much has already been done in making the UK market-friendly that the return on further moves in the same direction will be increasingly marginal. Second, more private ownership does not by itself guarantee greater economic efficiency. On average, private markets are better at allocating resources than the state, but not in all cases. For the UK to move up the economic league tables, the next government will have to develop policies that advance beyond the now orthodox 'free market' mantra. Here are some suggestions: \u0095 The Government must improve the UK's infrastructure and bring the performance of public services up to world standards. Anyone who uses UK public transport knows that it is a barrier to productivity. Workers who spend hours travelling to work under appalling conditions cannot possibly be as productive as they could be with a proper public transport system. Most UK privatisations have improved economic performance. Rail privatisation has not. Rethink this one fast, Messrs Blair and Brown.

Maybe if I just...' </p> <p>I rush in and wrestle him out of my swivel chair before he manages to pull the plug out and everything goes gurgling round the U-bend again, to use a metaphor best suited to my understanding of computer science. The fact is, I am hysterically fearful for the health of my mischievously marketed 'just get behind the wheel and drive' iMac, which imploded a few weeks ago while I was in the middle of downloading some important Elvis Costello lyrics, thus obliging me to call out an emergency husband-and-wife team of flying computer doctors who then spent five hours using magic software designed to piece together the virtual smithereens of my hard disk and in the process rake through all my long-deleted (or so I thought) emails, the sensitively handled bedroom scene from my forthcoming (July, actually) novel about a blameless northern journalist who accidentally exchanges bodily fluids with someone he isn't married to, and pages of internet idlings that on the face of things seem not exactly to betoken a man 100 per cent occupied in arduous employment.</p> <p>'This is how Gary Glitter got caught!' says John, who is the husband part of the unnecessarily cheerful doctoring team scrolling so quickly through the names of every website I have ever visited that I don't quite get the chance to explain how I came to hit upon the 'Hot Baps' er, organic bread home delivery service, or retell the hilarious story of how I keyed in 'Bygones' - the Victorian museum in Torquay - and ended up with 'Big Ones' instead. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

'Dad, how can we get a video off the internet?' </p> <p>'Not possible,' I say. </p> <p>They give me a list of 14 schoolchums who have done the not possible. I explain that the reason it is not possible is that they'll have to get past me first, which I admit is a rash challenge since three of them boast yellow belts in karate while I only have a bad back and a certificate commemorating the day I swam two widths of our local non-Olympic-sized municipal pool in 1964. </p> <p>My wife chooses this moment to shout up from the kitchen and remind me that the subject of today's cruel irony is that she is about to gambol off delightedly to her IT training course, which is the first strand of a reskilling money-disposal programme designed to free her from the tyranny of teaching and create exciting, flexible opportunities in who knows - online shopping perhaps! I give the children a stern warning and pop down to warm the little one's milk and in the process break two of my wife's favourite rules by standing in full view of the neighbours eating spaghetti from the pan using my fingers. I get back upstairs to find that my computer alert message has been changed from a pleasant pipe-organ effect to a loud 'Oi, what do you think you're doing!'

The fact is, I am hysterically fearful for the health of my mischievously marketed 'just get behind the wheel and drive' iMac, which imploded a few weeks ago while I was in the middle of downloading some important Elvis Costello lyrics, thus obliging me to call out an emergency husband-and-wife team of flying computer doctors who then spent five hours using magic software designed to piece together the virtual smithereens of my hard disk and in the process rake through all my long-deleted (or so I thought) emails, the sensitively handled bedroom scene from my forthcoming (July, actually) novel about a blameless northern journalist who accidentally exchanges bodily fluids with someone he isn't married to, and pages of internet idlings that on the face of things seem not exactly to betoken a man 100 per cent occupied in arduous employment. 'This is how Gary Glitter got caught!' says John, who is the husband part of the unnecessarily cheerful doctoring team scrolling so quickly through the names of every website I have ever visited that I don't quite get the chance to explain how I came to hit upon the 'Hot Baps' er, organic bread home delivery service, or retell the hilarious story of how I keyed in 'Bygones' - the Victorian museum in Torquay - and ended up with 'Big Ones' instead. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Rarely have I laughed so uncontrollably in a situation that could only be brought to an end with the presentation of a large bill, since which moment I have been anxious not to have my expensive new innards clogged up with rubbish that has not even the distinction of being of my own making. The eldest comes clattering back up the stairs, with the other three in tow. 'Dad, how can we get a video off the internet?' 'Not possible,' I say. They give me a list of 14 schoolchums who have done the not possible. I explain that the reason it is not possible is that they'll have to get past me first, which I admit is a rash challenge since three of them boast yellow belts in karate while I only have a bad back and a certificate commemorating the day I swam two widths of our local non-Olympic-sized municipal pool in 1964. My wife chooses this moment to shout up from the kitchen and remind me that the subject of today's cruel irony is that she is about to gambol off delightedly to her IT training course, which is the first strand of a reskilling money-disposal programme designed to free her from the tyranny of teaching and create exciting, flexible opportunities in who knows - online shopping perhaps! I give the children a stern warning and pop down to warm the little one's milk and in the process break two of my wife's favourite rules by standing in full view of the neighbours eating spaghetti from the pan using my fingers. I get back upstairs to find that my computer alert message has been changed from a pleasant pipe-organ effect to a loud 'Oi, what do you think you're doing!' The answer to which is, of course, I've no idea. \u0095 phil.hogan@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Thomssi was still not convinced. A day trader, he spent most of Thursday lounging around one of Yahoo's financial chat rooms swapping idle gossip. Ironically, most of last week's gossip was about Yahoo, the internet portal now valued at a tenth of the $100 billion it was worth at the peak of the dotcom boom. </p> <p>Another trader, who went by the handle Coolguy, believed the internet company's share price was due for a rebound. Things couldn't really get much worse, Coolguy figured. </p> <p>But Thomssi was dubious. 'I still think it's better looking for value in traditionals for the next six months,' was his sober assessment. </p> <p>Thomssi may be proved right. As the chat rooms hummed with gossip about the world's second favourite online site - the Yahoo portal is visited by nearly 200 million unique users a month - the company's share price ticked ever lower. </p> <p>It could go further south in the coming weeks. Even Thomssi's professional counterparts over on Wall Street are struggling to find anything positive to say about the business. </p> <p>After all, this was a company that last week hit the markets with a devastating triple whammy. Revenues, the California-based firm was forced to admit, would be between $170 million and $180m for the latest quarter, compared with an analysts' consensus of $240m. </p> <p>On the back of the dreadful earnings figures, Tim Koogle, the company's race car-driving, guitar-strumming chief executive, announced he was stepping down, although he would stay on as chairman. </p> <p>Then, in a lamentable attempt to woo the market, Yahoo unveiled a $500m share buy-back plan. Nonplussed analysts pointed out this would represent only about 5 per cent of the company's outstanding shares based on its current price - hardly enough to have an effect. </p> <p>'What a difference eight weeks makes,' noted heavyweight Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget, a man whose sparkling predictions for the dotcom sector have spectacularly and repeatedly failed to materialise. Blodget, at the start of this year a buyer of Yahoo, has now gone cold on the stock, noting that 'Yahoo's business has deteriorated significantly... with the market for online advertising falling off a cliff'. </p> <p>Dotcom companies are Yahoo's biggest headache. As market sentiment has shifted away from them, they have pared back their online ad spend. Merrill Lynch estimates that the dotcom sector was responsible for 33 per cent of Yahoo's revenues in the fourth quarter of last year but will represent only 20 per cent this quarter. </p> <p>This might not be as worrying as it sounds. Jeffrey Mallett, Yahoo's brash and combative president, has been keen to cut revenues generated by dotcom firms to 15 per cent by the end of the year. But not everyone is convinced Yahoo is well-positioned to grow revenues from the old bricks and mortar world. For a start, fears of a US slowdown have caused companies to cut their ad budgets. </p> <p>And those companies that are still spending are suspicious of Yahoo. In the past the company, despite its seemingly laid-back West Coast persona, has liked to play hardball, negotiating directly with businesses rather than using the big advertising houses to help forge long-standing relationships. </p> <p>For a while the approach worked, simply because the ad agencies were slow to embrace the net. But as the markets slide Yahoo may wish it had started to develop closer relationships with its clients much earlier. </p> <p>It might also have wished that in the past it had been a bit more flexible when negotiating with them. Its heavy-handed manner has left many ill-disposed to Yahoo at a time when it needs friends. </p> <p>Most alarming of all, the number of unique users has not grown by nearly as much as analysts were hoping. The likes of Blodget were, until recently, suggesting that Yahoo would be capable of drawing in 500 million unique users a month in five to seven years' time. </p> <p>But in January the company announced that user traffic was up only 3 per cent to 185 million visitors, compared with 180 million in December. Wall Street had been hoping for a 12 per cent rise. </p> <p>As the company's fortunes slide, there's a growing and damaging suspicion that Yahoo's management team is losing the plot, divided over whether the company should put up a For Sale sign. </p> <p>Yahoo has been fiercely keen to stay independent since it was founded in 1994 by two Stanford University students, Jerry Yang and David Filo. But it seems that someone high in Yahoo is keen to cut a deal. Disney is certainly interested in the portal. Michael Eisner, its chief executive, has said as much, provided the price was right. Viacom is mentioned as a possible stalking horse. Vivendi Universal wants some sort of relationship. </p> <p>Some even punt the idea that ever-hungry Vodafone might fancy it. But Yahoo, not to mention its rivals, is split on whether the move would make sense. </p> <p>'Do they need to do a deal? I'm not convinced. They remain a strong player in the market,' said Alex Kovach, managing director of Lycos UK. </p> <p>There are also suggestions that Koogle, Yang and Mallett are split over future strategy. Mallett is keen to remove Yahoo's reliance on advertising revenues by diversifying. He has plans to develop its e-commerce arm as well as its web-conferencing businesses, turning it into much more of a business to business player. </p> <p>Others within Yahoo appear cautious. What is irrefutable, though, is that the jury has yet to make up its mind on whether Yahoo can make such a leap, and the markets are not known for patience. Further acquisitions to help spread the company's portfolio of interests are effectively ruled out by the slide in Yahoo's share price. </p> <p>Despite its collapse, Yahoo's shares are still valued at 39 times earnings, compared with an average 21 for US equities. Or, to put it another way, it still has a long way to fall if it continues to disappoint. Such concerns seem to have given rise to something of a bunker mentality at Yahoo's Santa Clara HQ. In a bid to preserve cash and weather the bad times, the company, which declined to talk to The Observer , now seems to be focusing on its US operations at the expense of Europe and Asia. </p> <p>In short, critics say as its fortunes have slumped, Yahoo has taken its eye off becoming a global player. This is perhaps understandable. As one senior executive with a rival portal put it: 'When you're up to your arse in alligators, it's hard to remember your objective was to drain the swamp.' </p> <p>Disgruntled by the way the parent company was refusing to invest in its operations outside the US, the managing director of Yahoo Europe, Fabiola Arredondo - recently voted the most powerful European businesswoman - quit last month. 'Yahoo seems to have been struggling with investment in international expansion recently and this is no doubt what has been frustrating Fabiola,' said Judy Gibbons, vice president of Microsoft MSN Europe. </p> <p>Time was MSN could only look on in awe as Yahoo grew. But by November it had 230 million unique users, overtaking Yahoo. Now the company's diminishing place in the world, which so frustrated Arredondo, has sparked an exodus. </p> <p>Within a couple of days of Arredondo's departure, Yahoo's Asian head Savio Chow threw in the towel. Earlier this month Mark Rubinstein, managing director of Yahoo's Canadian operations, joined the exit club. He is unlikely to be the last: other executives are said to be contemplating the departure lounge. Will the last one to leave Santa Clara please turn out the lights... </p> <p><strong>From Yahoo! to dotcom hell</strong></p> <p><strong> 1994</strong> </p> <p>Stanford graduates David Filo and Jerry Yang develop the! search engine for their own amusement.

Leoni Wiring Systems, based in the traditional pit town of Newcastle-under-Lyme in north Staffordshire, was one of the troubled carmaker's bigger suppliers. Almost two-thirds of its sales - and the livelihoods of most of its 1,800 employees - were dependent on Rover and Land Rover. </p> <p>Ironically, Leoni is not British, but German-owned. The factory, which used to belong to Lucas, had been in German hands for only 10 days before BMW pulled the plug. More poignantly, it was the BMW link which had encouraged Leoni to buy the old Lucas Rists Wires &amp; Cables in the first place. </p> <p>The story of Lucas Rists also takes in the troubles of British manufacturing and Britain's motor industry in microcosm. Since the Rover crisis, around 900 jobs - half the workforce - have gone in Newcastle. Sister plants in Accrington and Luton have been closed, with the loss of 700 more jobs. But the firm's gritty determination to survival, both management and unions hope, shows that British engineering expertise has a vibrant and valued future. </p> <p>'Last year we could have ended up with no Rover and no Land Rover,' said Jack Grindrod, general manager of Leoni Wiring Systems UK. 'But we still have engineers, which Germany is crying out for. It has been a hard year, but we've diversified and won new contracts. And Leoni is committed to building us here into their second centre of engineering excellence.' </p> <p>Lucas Rists was founded in 1927. At its height in the 1970s it was the Potteries town's biggest employer, with 5,000 people manufacturing electrical wiring systems, power leads and battery cables. Before the Rover crisis, it had already been through Lucas' traumatic and short-sighted multi-billion merger with debt-laden US rival Varity. In one fell swoop a great British name in motor components was dismembered and destabilised. </p> <p>In 1999, when the new LucasVarity was picked off by TWH, another predatory US component maker, Rists found itself surplus to requirements. No wonder, then, that BMW's purchasing people preferred a reliable German firm to snap up a key Rover supplier. </p> <p>Formed from a merger in 1917, Leoni traces its roots to the sixteenth century, when a French craftsman from Lyon - where the art of drawing wire was developed - set up shop in Nuremberg. In the last five years, while British firms have retreated, sales have tripled to \u00a3600 million as it has snapped up rivals and expanded rapidly into eastern Europe, the Americas and Africa. But when it moved on the UK, sadly for Leoni, it was completely unaware of BMW's secret plans to offload Rover. </p> <p>The reality is, however, that to stem looming losses the Rover crisis simply accelerated what was going to happen to Lucas Rists anyway. Under relentless price pressure from the carmakers, component firms have long been shifting manufacturing from high-cost countries such as the UK and Germany to eastern Europe, Asia and even North Africa. Wiring assemblies for the Rover 75 were already destined for Leoni's brand new plant in Romania (opened, ironically, by the British ambassador to Bucharest) and cable manufacture has transferred to the Czech Republic.. </p> <p>'We have lost far more manufacturing jobs as a result of pressure from carmakers to leave these shores than from the collapse of Rover,' said Tony Woodley, the Transport &amp; General worker's Union's national organiser for the motor industry. 'From where we could have been, Rover and its suppliers have done reasonably well in tough circumstances.' </p> <p>West Midlands suppliers have certainly suffered hundreds of job losses since Rover was taken over. But the total is a fraction of the 50,000 predicted had Rover shut down and difficult to differentiate from the other pressures facing the industry. </p> <p>Since the crisis, Leoni has worked more, not less, closely with Rover. It has just won new contracts for the Rover 25 and MGF. While the design work will be done in the UK, however, the contracts have been priced to be made abroad. </p> <p>But from adversity has also come opportunity. Leoni is forging strong ties with Premier Automotive Group, part of Ford, the US car-maker which bought Land Rover, Lucas Rists' biggest customer. Following the ending of carmaking at Luton, Leoni UK is hoping that the Newcastle factory's proximity to Vauxhall's Merseyside plant at Ellesmere port will also bring new opportunities. As part of a strategy to develop specialised lower-volume business, Leoni has also wooed construction equipment makers and engine manufacturers. The new, medium-sized Bentley, to be made by Volkswagen nearby at Crewe, is another major opportunity for Leoni. </p> <p>With price pressure unrelenting, however, doubts remain over whether much manufacturing - even specialised small-volume work - will be carried out in the UK in future. For staff and the unions, the question is crucial: of the 850 workers left at Newcastle, about two-thirds are hourly paid assembly workers. </p> <p>'The future isn't rosy, but the good thing is that the Germans at Leoni have shown a long-term commitment here,' said TGWU regional official Margaret Armstrong. 'When the Rover crisis hit and Leoni had only been in the picture a matter of weeks, I had great reservations. They could have upped sticks and said we bought a pig in a poke, but they haven't. They have had to change the focus, but at the same time they haven't tried to save costs by cutting wages and eroding terms and conditions.' </p> <p>At Leoni's European works council, British union delegates get little tea and sympathy from their German comrades. Over the past few years, Leoni's engineering centre at Kitzingen in Bavaria has gone through the same mill. Ironically, the one big carmaker Leoni does not yet supply in Germany is BMW.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a company in the West Midlands that should think of putting 'dotcom' at the end of its name. Like most dotcom firms, it racks up multi-million pound losses. And like most dotcom firms it explains this away by saying that it's on a long-term path to profitability, so analysing its bottom line now makes no sense. Like many dotcom firms, it faces huge competition from a plethora of (bigger and tougher) rivals with deeper pockets. But unlike most dotcom companies, Rover actually makes something. But for how much longer? A year after Phoenix snatched Rover away from venture capitalists Alchemy Partners, its future is still uncertain. The company says it is confident that it will move into the black next year. And it points with pride to the launch of three new MG-badged cars - the X10, X20 and X30 - as evidence that its development plans are on course.

      "body": "<p>A year ago on Wednesday a small report appeared on the news agency wires. The German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung had a story that Munich-based carmaker BMW was to dump its \u00a3880 million loss-making Rover subsidiary. </p> <p>The next day - 15 March - it emerged that the buyer was London venture capitalist Alchemy Partners, whose head Jon Moulton quickly outlined his plan. </p> <p>At a packed press conference on 16 March, Moulton coolly said he intended to cut the output of Rover's Longbridge plant in Birmingham from 230,000 cars a year to fewer than 100,000 and to concentrate on MG sports cars. </p> <p>The implications were horrendous. Experts forecast that Longbridge's 8,000 workforce would fall as low as 1,500, with thousands more jobs lost at suppliers. </p> <p>BMW had kept everyone in the dark, while reportedly calling its UK arm 'the English Patient' in private. Industry Secretary Stephen Byers was furious. Only the previous Friday he had met Rover boss Werner Samann, who made only anoblique remark about BMW's future involvement. </p> <p>In fact BMW had been negotiating with Alchemy for six months, and had effectively carved Rover up, giving Moulton Longbridge and the Rover and MG names. Land Rover was sold separately to Ford, while the Germans kept the Cowley factory to build the new Mini. </p> <p>Byers travelled to Longbridge on 17 March to set up an emergency task force. He also met John Towers, a former Rover executive, and suggested he should rescue the group. This idea also came to local businessman and councillor John Hemming, and to Tony Woodley of the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union. All three claim they had it first. </p> <p>Towers' Phoenix consortium emerged amid much back-biting. Hemming was soon distanced: Byers was worried about his non-Labour political connections. </p> <p>Byers told BMW of a rival bid at the DTI in London on 6 and 7 April. On 10 April, again at the DTI, Towers presented his plan to BMW. There were problems. Towers had no financial backing. He wanted BMW's new Mini. </p> <p>The Germans would not agree. Alchemy was to take over Longbridge on 28 April. </p> <p>Towers struggled to find the \u00a3200 million he needed to persuade BMW. DTI officials say the Germans were nervous about being liable for redundancies if his consortium failed. </p> <p>The clock continued ticking, but BMW's board in Munich - pressed by Woodley and concerned at the ferocious response in the UK - swung in favour of Phoenix, which promised fewer job losses. </p> <p>Then Moulton unexpectedly pulled out. The field was clear for Towers, who found the \u00a3200m from US company Burdale Financial. On 9 May his company, Techtronic 2000, took over at Longbridge, paying only \u00a310. </p> <p>For his tenner Towers and his fellow directors - Nick Stephenson, local car dealer John Edwards and the finance director of Edwards' firm, Peter Beale - picked up assets and stock at Longbridge worth \u00a3740m, an interest-free \u00a3500m loan or BMW 'dowry', to come in three tranches - and no debts. BMW, which had invested \u00a33 billion in Rover, took responsibility for those. </p> <p>Yet sceptics felt the new company was thin on resources - a view that took hold partly because, as a private operation, it gave out little information. And experts did not believe Rover could take on giants such as Ford and General Motors in an oversupplied global market. </p> <p>Nor did Rover's 200,000-car-a-year target impress. It would not be enough to compete with high-volume, low-cost giants. When Rover announced sales of 205,000 last year, there was concern over margins: Rover had twice cut its prices. </p> <p>And when Towers said the revamped small and medium R25 and R45 and the executive R75 would be the basis for the medium term, experts snorted, pointing to a flow of gleaming new rival models. </p> <p>Towers had to forge a partnership with a major manufacturer to share the estimated \u00a3400m-plus costs of developing new car platforms. But as the months wore on, no details emerged. Then a name did appear, little Proton of Malaysia, which seemed interested only in a partnership to produce engines. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the squabbling continued. Towers' strategy was not always clear. In October he was reported as wanting to sell the company. Later that month unhappy non-executive directors were said to be planning to bid for MG. The same week, directors Terry Whitmore and Brian Parker resigned. There were also wrangles with BMW about the valuation of the company and the Longbridge Powertrain engine plant, which Rover wants and BMW still owns. </p> <p>These last two problems are expected to be resolved soon. but the scepticism persists. Critics point to the US, where Ford, GM and Chrysler announced profits warnings before Christmas, and to UK closures by Vauxhall and Ford. </p> <p>Experts say the solution is new models at lower cost with higher technology. 'They must be joking, with their model range,' says one observer. </p> <p>Chief executive Kevin Howe argues that the renamed MG Rover can turn the \u00a3880m loss by BMW's old Rover into a financial improvement of \u00a3600m - of which \u00a3100m would come from Land Rover and \u00a3500m from stripping out BMW losses over two years. But losses will go on for two years: \u00a3300m for eight months of 2000, and half that expected in 2001. </p> <p>The cash position is vital. Rover ended last year with \u00a3200m in the bank: \u00a3200m from BMW's first dowry payment, and working capital from the sale of 30,000 of the 70,000 cars left by BMW. Set against this are losses, among other things, the \u00a3100m it cost to develop the new MGZ-badged 25, 45 and 75, along with the 75 estate and two new MGFs. </p> <p>Howe believes he can finance new models from the balance sheet and cash generated by sales for five years. </p> <p>Rover is cagey about costs, partly because they depend on whether it stays alone. If it does, Howe says, the R75 platform can be used for new small, medium and large cars. On this basis, the new range would cost more than \u00a3300m. </p> <p>But Rover's Plan A is still to find a credible partner. Howe says there are three options: first, a collaboration with a components and systems supplier such as the UK's Mayflower (a partner in the MGF), or with Magna of Canada to develop the 75 platform; second, a new platform developed with a supplier; or third, a new one with a manufacturer. Observers point to Peugeot, VW and Fiat as partners. Howe will not discuss names. </p> <p>Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School says: 'I expect more than half of development costs [to come] from revenues. The less of the dowry is used, the more attractive the company to a partner or buyer.' </p> <p>Howe is sticking to Towers' 200,000 target. Rhys says it is achievable, with 50,000 MGs, 50,000 R75 saloons and estates, and 100,000 split between the 25 and 45. But 180,000 is more likely for 2001. </p> <p>Not all are convinced. One critic says: 'We don't know how many cars they produced last year. I suspect it will be much lower than 200,000. They have cleared out people. They are concentrating on sporty MGs. It looks similar to Alchemy.' </p> <p>Howe claims the number of employees fell last year from 6,800, to 5,500. Rhys says: 'What has been done in steadying the ship has been done well.' Now, 'they have to make up their mind which strategy to go for... Whatever happens an autonomous future is not on the cards.' </p> <p>At least when that comes about - whether Rover is sold or a partnership is announced - we will not read about it first in the German press.</p>",

The difficulty is that it has now become a precondition.' Dissident republicans have been responsible for a spate of attacks including last week end's bomb at the BBC's news centre in west London. Police believe the Real IRA and Continuity IRA were involved. Republican and security sources said that, by reactivating its England department, the IRA was 'keeping all options open' in the event of the Good Friday Agree ment collapsing after the general election. It is understood Ministers have been made aware of the unit's presence in England and that it is being run by a senior Provisional from west Belfast who masterminded a plot to smuggle guns from Florida in 1999. He is said to be a close ally of Adams. The British and Irish governments are understood to be perplexed that the Provisionals have intensified their 'targeting' in Britain. A senior Irish source said: 'They are creating the impression that they might go back to war if the Agreement fails. But in reality it does not fit the strategy of their political leadership at the talks.' Security sources believe the activities of the Provisional IRA are entirely separate from those of the Real IRA, led by former IRA quartermaster Michael McKevitt. Republicans say the organisation is growing all over Ireland including west Belfast, the Adams stronghold. The Real IRA is a relatively small organisation compared to the Provisionals, with only a couple of hundred members on either side of the Irish border. What it lacks in numbers it makes up for in experience. Security in Lisburn was stepped up yesterday to prevent what security sources called an 'imminent' terrorist attack. Sources said there were fears the Real IRA was behind a plan to carry out a major bombing in the town. The move followed the discovery of a stolen white van, which was abandoned three miles outside the town last Tuesday. The vehicle had been hijacked in Dundalk. Security forces believe it was left there as a decoy.",

      "body": "<p>Harry Berger was in despair yesterday. As he looked out across the rocky fells of the Eskdale valley in the Lake District, speckled with white dots of sheep, he knew foot-and-mouth disease meant his ruin.</p> <p>Yet Berger is not a farmer. He is a hotelier. He has lost \u00a317,000 since the outbreak. 'We may have to close permanently if this goes on much longer,' he said. It may not sound like a fortune. But Berger's situation is replicated across the country - and means Britain's tourist industry faces devastation.</p> <p>With tracts of hill and lakes still banned to humans because of an illness that means only that farm animals fetch less at market, the rural tourist industry has already lost \u00a3200 million - all sacrificed to save farmers.</p> <p>While rescue packages are in place to save the people involved in animal farming, there will be no help for Berger and thousands like him. Tourist authorities yesterday warned the industry was being devastated by the closure of much of the countryside. It is being deluged with cancellations.</p> <p>Hundreds of jobs are being lost, and some hotels have closed permanently. Owners are bitter that the slaughter policy is costing their industry far more than any of the possible benefits to farming. As the crucial Easter weekend approaches, the damage to the industry will escalate.</p> <p>The English Tourist Council, which estimates countryside tourism is worth \u00a312 billion a year, says business is 75 per cent below normal. Rural tourism should be worth about \u00a3150m a week at this time of year, meaning losses of more than \u00a3100m a week. The cost to farmers so far been a fraction of that, estimated at less than \u00a330m.</p> <p>Thousands of people from overseas have cancelled bookings - and the images have even put them off cities such as Edinburgh and London.</p> <p>'We are very concerned about what the foot-and-mouth outbreak is doing to Britain's reputation overseas,' said Philippa Swaine of the British Tourist Authority.</p> <p>She added: 'Call centres for foreign travel are very quiet. The worrying thing is that we are having cancellations from France and the US, which are our biggest markets. This is also the time of year that people are planning holidays for the summer, and they are thinking they will give Britain a miss this year.'</p> <p>This weekend, the number of cases of foot and mouth reached 139, and chief vet Jim Scudamore admitted the scale of the epidemic had come as a shock. It was hoped that the ban on moving livestock would have helped win the battle against the virus, but the disease is being spread by wind. More than 100,000 animals have been earmarked for slaughter.</p> <p>As the disease continued to spread yesterday because of the tradition of not vaccinating, cases were confirmed at four farms in Cumbria, three in Scotland, two in Devon, two in Co Durham and one in Anglesey.</p> <p>The total number of animals facing slaughter was now 114,000, of which 82,000 had already been killed. The Government justifies its strategy of slaughter on the grounds that it will work out cheaper for the livestock industry in the long run than vaccination. But tourism - worth \u00a363bn a year - is being crippled by the moves to protect livestock exports, worth \u00a31.2bn a year. Tourism contributes about four times as much to the national economy as farming, and employs four times as many people.</p> <p>Not that this will last if the crisis in the tourist industry is not tackled, says Berger, who has already had to lay off three staff at his hotel. 'Maff [the Agriculture Ministry] is running all this, but they're not thinking about other businesses,' he said.

      "bodyText": "Harry Berger was in despair yesterday. As he looked out across the rocky fells of the Eskdale valley in the Lake District, speckled with white dots of sheep, he knew foot-and-mouth disease meant his ruin. Yet Berger is not a farmer. He is a hotelier. He has lost \u00a317,000 since the outbreak. 'We may have to close permanently if this goes on much longer,' he said. It may not sound like a fortune. But Berger's situation is replicated across the country - and means Britain's tourist industry faces devastation. With tracts of hill and lakes still banned to humans because of an illness that means only that farm animals fetch less at market, the rural tourist industry has already lost \u00a3200 million - all sacrificed to save farmers. While rescue packages are in place to save the people involved in animal farming, there will be no help for Berger and thousands like him. Tourist authorities yesterday warned the industry was being devastated by the closure of much of the countryside. It is being deluged with cancellations. Hundreds of jobs are being lost, and some hotels have closed permanently. Owners are bitter that the slaughter policy is costing their industry far more than any of the possible benefits to farming. As the crucial Easter weekend approaches, the damage to the industry will escalate. The English Tourist Council, which estimates countryside tourism is worth \u00a312 billion a year, says business is 75 per cent below normal. Rural tourism should be worth about \u00a3150m a week at this time of year, meaning losses of more than \u00a3100m a week. The cost to farmers so far been a fraction of that, estimated at less than \u00a330m. Thousands of people from overseas have cancelled bookings - and the images have even put them off cities such as Edinburgh and London. 'We are very concerned about what the foot-and-mouth outbreak is doing to Britain's reputation overseas,' said Philippa Swaine of the British Tourist Authority. She added: 'Call centres for foreign travel are very quiet. The worrying thing is that we are having cancellations from France and the US, which are our biggest markets. This is also the time of year that people are planning holidays for the summer, and they are thinking they will give Britain a miss this year.' This weekend, the number of cases of foot and mouth reached 139, and chief vet Jim Scudamore admitted the scale of the epidemic had come as a shock. It was hoped that the ban on moving livestock would have helped win the battle against the virus, but the disease is being spread by wind. More than 100,000 animals have been earmarked for slaughter. As the disease continued to spread yesterday because of the tradition of not vaccinating, cases were confirmed at four farms in Cumbria, three in Scotland, two in Devon, two in Co Durham and one in Anglesey. The total number of animals facing slaughter was now 114,000, of which 82,000 had already been killed. The Government justifies its strategy of slaughter on the grounds that it will work out cheaper for the livestock industry in the long run than vaccination. But tourism - worth \u00a363bn a year - is being crippled by the moves to protect livestock exports, worth \u00a31.2bn a year. Tourism contributes about four times as much to the national economy as farming, and employs four times as many people. Not that this will last if the crisis in the tourist industry is not tackled, says Berger, who has already had to lay off three staff at his hotel. 'Maff [the Agriculture Ministry] is running all this, but they're not thinking about other businesses,' he said. 'Tourism is much bigger in this county than farming, producing more income, and it's being ignored.' In the next valley along from Berger's empty hotel, in Wasdale, Howard Christie has been doing the calculations. Since Maff started telling visitors to steer clear, his Wasdale Head Inn has lost \u00a326,000 of business, with cancellations from the Netherlands, Belgium and the US.

Large parts of the Scottish Highlands are now closed to walkers and climbers, with mountain guides and hotel owners around Fort William, Glencoe and Ben Nevis saying they face financial ruin. At Northcote Manor in High Hampton in Devon, the phone stopped ringing on Wednesday, when the exclusion zone around a cattle market 15 miles away was extended to its front gate. The South West Tourism Board reckons the industry in its area will lose \u00a3500m. One hotel owner in Devon, already burdened with debt, has simply left his keys and fled.

Their community mobile phone network has allowed them to get to the scene of trouble within minutes and defuse tensions between loyalist and republican youths. But now the scheme, which has prevented riots escalating into widespread communal conflict, is closing down.

      "body": "<p>At first glance the Macedonian village of Tanusevci and the Bosnian city of Mostar do not have much in common. The houses of the former - sitting on the Kosovo-Macedonia border - straggle over a forested ridge sown with mines. It is a dirt-poor place. Its few score inhabitants survive on subsistence farming, cutting timber and smuggling across the border.</p> <p>Mostar, by contrast, is a vibrant city that still bears the scars of its siege during the Bosnian war. The streets of its old quarter are lined with Ottoman buildings of honey-coloured stone. It is also divided. Not by an international border but by the ethnic divide that keeps Bosniaks in the city's east and Croats in the west.</p> <p>Their similarity is this: events in Mostar and Tanusevci in the last two weeks have been ringing alarm bells across the international community as the most visible signs of a new crisis gripping the Balkans from Bosnia to Bulgaria and from Belgrade to Athens.</p> <p>It is a crisis that is reversing all the assumptions of the international community's experience in the Balkans - one that is turning enemies into friends and old friends into bitter foes. In the new Serbia of Vojislav Kostunica, Nato is suddenly being feted for its tough stance on Albanian extremists in the south of Serbia. In Washington, Paris and London it is the Kosovo Albanians - saved from the hands of Slobodan Milosevic - and the Montenegrans (who supported Nato over Kosovo), who are suddenly the problem.</p> <p>The heart of the problem is a resurgence in nationalism across the region among minority extremists that some fear could spark a new regional conflagration. In Tanusevci ethnic Albanian guerrillas who fought with the KLA in Kosovo against the Serbs are now fighting the Macedonian security forces. Their aim apparently: to create a 'Greater Kosovo' linking ethnic Albanian communities that live just outside its borders in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, threatening wider ethnic violence between Macedonia's majority Slav population and one third Albanian minority.</p> <p>For a decade analysts have warned of the risk of war in Macedonia - a conflict, they say, that could suck in countries such as Bulgaria and Greece. Last week - as if on cue - Bulgaria sent military aid to Macedonia's armed forces while Greece sent a mission to report on the crisis on the border.</p> <p>In Mostar the events have been no less alarming. Last weekend, a congress of the nationalist Bosnian Croat party - the HDZ - voted to set up a Croat ministate. In reply, the international community's administrator in Bosnia - Wolfgang Petritsch - 'fired' the HDZ's leader, Ante Jelavic, disbarring him from politics for threatening the fragile Dayton peace deal that ended the Bosnian war.</p> <p>And it is not just events in Tanusevci and Mostar that are alarming Western governments. A dangerous coincidence of events is increasing tension across the region. In Serbia, the US government has imposed a deadline of 31 March for the arrest of former Yugoslav dictator Milosevic, if its new rulers want US aid. A few days later the citizens of Montenegro - which, with Serbia, constitutes the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - go to the polls in an election expected to set the scene for a referendum on independence within three months. In Kosovo itself, where province-wide elections are due later in the year, pressure for independence is growing, amid a slew of murders of ethnic minorities.</p> <p>And the former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army are also accused of backing the fighters of the new National Liberation Army that appeared for the first time last month in Tanusevci, and its sister organisation the UCPMB - which is fighting to establish autonomy for Albanian villages in the Presevo Valley of south Serbia.</p> <p>'The one thing these crises have in common is borders,' says Chris Bird, a spokesman for the Office of the High Representative which oversees Bosnia's administration.

      "bodyText": "At first glance the Macedonian village of Tanusevci and the Bosnian city of Mostar do not have much in common. The houses of the former - sitting on the Kosovo-Macedonia border - straggle over a forested ridge sown with mines. It is a dirt-poor place. Its few score inhabitants survive on subsistence farming, cutting timber and smuggling across the border. Mostar, by contrast, is a vibrant city that still bears the scars of its siege during the Bosnian war. The streets of its old quarter are lined with Ottoman buildings of honey-coloured stone. It is also divided. Not by an international border but by the ethnic divide that keeps Bosniaks in the city's east and Croats in the west. Their similarity is this: events in Mostar and Tanusevci in the last two weeks have been ringing alarm bells across the international community as the most visible signs of a new crisis gripping the Balkans from Bosnia to Bulgaria and from Belgrade to Athens. It is a crisis that is reversing all the assumptions of the international community's experience in the Balkans - one that is turning enemies into friends and old friends into bitter foes. In the new Serbia of Vojislav Kostunica, Nato is suddenly being feted for its tough stance on Albanian extremists in the south of Serbia. In Washington, Paris and London it is the Kosovo Albanians - saved from the hands of Slobodan Milosevic - and the Montenegrans (who supported Nato over Kosovo), who are suddenly the problem. The heart of the problem is a resurgence in nationalism across the region among minority extremists that some fear could spark a new regional conflagration. In Tanusevci ethnic Albanian guerrillas who fought with the KLA in Kosovo against the Serbs are now fighting the Macedonian security forces. Their aim apparently: to create a 'Greater Kosovo' linking ethnic Albanian communities that live just outside its borders in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, threatening wider ethnic violence between Macedonia's majority Slav population and one third Albanian minority. For a decade analysts have warned of the risk of war in Macedonia - a conflict, they say, that could suck in countries such as Bulgaria and Greece. Last week - as if on cue - Bulgaria sent military aid to Macedonia's armed forces while Greece sent a mission to report on the crisis on the border. In Mostar the events have been no less alarming. Last weekend, a congress of the nationalist Bosnian Croat party - the HDZ - voted to set up a Croat ministate. In reply, the international community's administrator in Bosnia - Wolfgang Petritsch - 'fired' the HDZ's leader, Ante Jelavic, disbarring him from politics for threatening the fragile Dayton peace deal that ended the Bosnian war. And it is not just events in Tanusevci and Mostar that are alarming Western governments. A dangerous coincidence of events is increasing tension across the region. In Serbia, the US government has imposed a deadline of 31 March for the arrest of former Yugoslav dictator Milosevic, if its new rulers want US aid. A few days later the citizens of Montenegro - which, with Serbia, constitutes the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - go to the polls in an election expected to set the scene for a referendum on independence within three months. In Kosovo itself, where province-wide elections are due later in the year, pressure for independence is growing, amid a slew of murders of ethnic minorities. And the former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army are also accused of backing the fighters of the new National Liberation Army that appeared for the first time last month in Tanusevci, and its sister organisation the UCPMB - which is fighting to establish autonomy for Albanian villages in the Presevo Valley of south Serbia. 'The one thing these crises have in common is borders,' says Chris Bird, a spokesman for the Office of the High Representative which oversees Bosnia's administration. 'People are trying to redraw borders across the region. Our view is that if the international community allows that to happen it will mean dead people.' In the Balkans, it was ever thus: rival ethnic groups competing with their neighbours for imagined national spaces. 'What defines this rather dangerous phase,' adds a Foreign Office analyst, 'is that we are dealing with losers who are struggling for their survival. We are not looking at a repeat of the circumstances when Yugoslavia began to disintegrate at the beginning of the 1990s. The people we are dealing with now are the fanatics who became wealthy out of nationalist politics, crime and war. They feel that their power is being eroded and they will fight to survive.' Another dangerous factor, he believes is the complacency that emerged after the removal of Milosevic last October. 'There was a mis placed idea that when Milosevic was ousted things would immediately get better in the Balkans. Instead, his departure has revealed a series of unresolved problems which the international community has yet to get to grips with.' Biggest among those problems will be what happens in Montenegro. Encouraged by the Americans to believe it would be permitted to split from Serbia, the departure of Milosevic saw the same officials tell Montenegro to forget those aspirations, and renegotiate its ties with Serbia for a looser Yugoslav federation. It is an idea that angers many in Montenegro who argue that all of the other republics of the old Yugoslavia of General Tito - Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia and Macedonia - have won their independence. Why, they argue, should Montenegro be the exception? But while European Union and US policy is that Montenegro should remain in some federal relationship with the new Serbia of Vojislav Kostunica, privately officials believe there is little they can do to stop it seceding. Their concern, however, is less about the future of Montenegro itself but over the psychological impact that a voting for independence would have elsewhere: not least in neighbouring Kosovo itself, which the international community has decreed should stay within Serbia and not enjoy independence.

This is much higher than the \u00a31.7m widely reported last week. </p> <p>The accounts, for the calendar year, were issued on Budget day, last Wednesday, the busiest day of the year in the City. </p> <p>Since Barrett's arrival in autumn 1999, Barclays has snapped up the Woolwich and forged an insurance alliance with Legal &amp; General. It has also, sources close to the bank confirm, been exploring a possible merger with Dutch bank ABN Amro. </p> <p>But it ambitions to re-enter investment banking proper will unsettle the City following the disastrous performance and final disposal of BZW in 1998. </p> <p>This weekend a Barclays spokeswoman declined to discuss the ABN Amro talks or the bonuses. 'We never comment on speculation,' she said. 'Our approach to salaries is to reflect the market and pay for performance.' </p> <p>Recent City talk has been of 100 bonus millionaires at Barclays Capital. That is an exaggeration, Barclays' sources say, although investment banking chief Bob Diamond - hired on a \u00a35m package - is undoubtedly the bank's biggest earner. The division, which runs Barclays' bond market operations, made \u00a3403m last year, up from \u00a3311m. Its income, however, rose by \u00a3310m - and more than half of that was eaten up by rising costs, principally the huge bonuses. </p> <p>Barclays put the improved performance down to hectic activity last year in the bond and debt markets. In June, however, it transferred its top 250 corporate loan accounts to Barclays Capital. The effect of this was not disclosed. </p> <p>Sources close to the bank said the growing power of Barclays Capital had cost shareholders dear. 'Greedy investment bankers still take so much out,' said one. 'For every \u00a31 of income transferred to Canary Wharf, they pocket 50p or more.' </p> <p>Despite the recovery, Barclays' Capital is still the bank's worst performing division. Its operating return was just 0.25 per cent on its \u00a3157bn of assets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barclays Bank splashed out more than \u00a3150 million in City bonuses to executives at its investment banking and fund management arms last year. The news will infuriate its 50,000 high street staff, who have borne the brunt of massive cost-cutting and branch closures. The performance-related bonuses paid to 6,300 staff at Barclays Capital (in Canary Wharf) and Barclays Global Investors made up the lion's share of a \u00a3172m increase in the group's salary-related costs last year. Close analysis of Barclays' annual report also shows that Canadian chief executive Matt Barrett earned a total of \u00a32.8m, including profits on share options. This is much higher than the \u00a31.7m widely reported last week. The accounts, for the calendar year, were issued on Budget day, last Wednesday, the busiest day of the year in the City. Since Barrett's arrival in autumn 1999, Barclays has snapped up the Woolwich and forged an insurance alliance with Legal &amp; General. It has also, sources close to the bank confirm, been exploring a possible merger with Dutch bank ABN Amro. But it ambitions to re-enter investment banking proper will unsettle the City following the disastrous performance and final disposal of BZW in 1998. This weekend a Barclays spokeswoman declined to discuss the ABN Amro talks or the bonuses. 'We never comment on speculation,' she said. 'Our approach to salaries is to reflect the market and pay for performance.' Recent City talk has been of 100 bonus millionaires at Barclays Capital. That is an exaggeration, Barclays' sources say, although investment banking chief Bob Diamond - hired on a \u00a35m package - is undoubtedly the bank's biggest earner. The division, which runs Barclays' bond market operations, made \u00a3403m last year, up from \u00a3311m. Its income, however, rose by \u00a3310m - and more than half of that was eaten up by rising costs, principally the huge bonuses. Barclays put the improved performance down to hectic activity last year in the bond and debt markets. In June, however, it transferred its top 250 corporate loan accounts to Barclays Capital. The effect of this was not disclosed. Sources close to the bank said the growing power of Barclays Capital had cost shareholders dear. 'Greedy investment bankers still take so much out,' said one. 'For every \u00a31 of income transferred to Canary Wharf, they pocket 50p or more.' Despite the recovery, Barclays' Capital is still the bank's worst performing division. Its operating return was just 0.25 per cent on its \u00a3157bn of assets.",

Within weeks, he had acquired the first C\u00e9zanne ever owned by a museum. Ignoring his predecessor's 20-year struggle to show anything more than patriotic propaganda, he even had the gall to hang this French daub on the wall. At this scandal, the Prussian Parliament erupted in fury and called for Kaiser Wilhelm to intervene. The picture was removed and so, a few years later, was Tschudi himself - following a last brave bid to introduce Delacroix to Berlin. </p> <p>If it hadn't been for Tschudi, there would be very little foreign painting in the Nationalgalerie at all. There isn't much as it is - a handful of works by Courbet, Manet and Monet, plus the offending C\u00e9zanne. To understand what Tschudi was up against you need only read the diktat that confronted him every morning - 'To German Art' emblazoned in gold on the neo-classical facade of the building. </p> <p>Every director before or since has had to contend with this nationalist imperative. Those who made the effort to resist the Prussian patriots were generally wounded in action. The director who tried to defend the avant garde by constructing a 'Nordic' tradition - from Friedrich to German expressionism - was swiftly sacked by the Nazis. In 1937, almost all of the twentieth century art was seized and the modern wing was shut down. </p> <p>It is worth remembering that golden diktat as you walk through Spirit of an Age at London's National Gallery. Seventy-seven works have been borrowed from Berlin, all but seven painted in the nineteenth century. A filleted edition of an entire museum, the show is inevitably incomplete. It is also extremely various and wildly uneven, ranging from the outstanding to the strikingly bad. But every one of these pictures has had to conform at some time to an ever-changing ideal of German art. </p> <p>In the nineteenth century, that meant Gothic castles, swooning damsels and lovelorn heroes in medieval footwear. It meant Frederick the Great performing flute recitals to rapt audiences at Sanssouci and William I receiving a grand send-off to the Prussian Front. It meant Protestant sermons and national legends, divine sunsets over Bohemia and classical ruins transposed to Black Forest glades. Above all, at the beginning and end of the century, it meant the romantic yearnings of Caspar David Friedrich. </p> <p>There are seven paintings by Friedrich in this show, all of them purest content. Here are his mighty German oaks, shattered or snowbound, but still thrusting upwards like signposts to a future of national resurgence and hope. Here are his moons, seen from mountains and cliff-tops by lone figures silhouetted against the screen of glowing light - the immanence of God as revealed to awestruck mortals. </p> <p>One of these, Moonrise Over the Sea, is among the transcendent images of German art. A man and two women are seated on a rock, gazing out over a motionless sea. It is not clear exactly what they're looking at - Friedrich's onlookers experience such diffuse visions - the tall ships, the violet light on the water or the moon itself, rising behind a distant veil of clouds. Nor can one easily decipher the Christian allegory Friedrich compressed into this small picture in 1822. What remains is the powerful aura of significance: the spectacle of religious contemplation has become a contemplative object in itself. </p> <p>Beautiful as they are, these images are also coercive. In the flat plane of Friedrich's paint, so dead and uninflected, there is nowhere for the eye to go except where the master directs - to the top of the German tree, or out across the peaks to God in his Sudeten sunset. Friedrich's vision of the infinite is always circumscribed by the banality of his brushwork. So it's good to know, in the context of this show, that he had subversive aims as well. The figures in these paintings are wearing altdeutsch costumes - banned as the uniform of liberals in 1819. </p> <p>The seaside figures in Carl Blechen's Gulf of Naples are gazing into a wild blue never found in nature. Overexcited by the Italian skies, Blechen squeezed the cobalt directly from the tube. He was one of a dozen artists in this show who went south to Goethe's 'land where the lemons flower' for the landscape, the classical ruins and the example of the Renaissance. The 'Nazarenes' settled in a ruined monastery, painting each other in their cells and studying Raphael with religious fervour. Their stiff and pious works are remarkably hard to look at today. But at least one of them had a sense of humour. Carl Spitweg sketched English tourists among the ruins: bored, querulous and deeply buried in their guidebooks. </p> <p>All roads led to Rome for nineteenth century artists. The unexpected connection in Spirit of an Age is between Germany and its once and future enemy - France. You see this relationship flourish in the room where Manet and Courbet hang next to their German peers. Hans Thoma's Bunch of Wild Flowers is a beautiful variation on a Manet still life, elaborated around a spray of Bavarian gentians and buttercups. Wilhelm Liebl's realist portraits of villagers stand comparison with Courbet, who admired the Munich artist. But the most international of all these painters is probably the least well known - Adolph Menzel, the dwarfish Berliner whose career spanned more than half the century. </p> <p>Menzel was so versatile that it's hard to fix on his peculiar gift - but it has something to do with freedom, a resistance to the orthodox or predictable in any picture. Eyes conditioned by decades of impressionism may think they see it prefigured in his Balcony Room from 1845. But there is more to this bare interior, painted on a small rectangle of cardboard. </p> <p>Menzel is certainly interested in light, the way it fumbles among the gauze at the window, swims across the polished floor and dwindles to a mute opacity in the darkened mirror. But his brushwork is even more volatile, performing a single squiggle for a lamp, sidling along a chairback, shifting from matt shadow to melting reflection without any apparent transition. The room is empty. But the painting is full, vibrating with quixotic motion. </p> <p>Look at his ballroom scene, crammed with guests assaulting the buffet, and you see these transitions multiplied on a massive scale. Menzel works the room with amazing dexterity - slipping between the figures as they laugh, flirt or try to eat while standing upright, goblets precariously balanced on plates. Degas copied this painting, fascinated by its dissolves and shifts of focus as Menzel skims the social theatre, from lonely shadows to super-lit mirth, conversation surging and becalmed. </p> <p>Menzel painted steam trains, iron works, gas-lit theatres - a modern Germany the Nationalgalerie could accept. He even painted that image of Frederick at Sanssouci, 'like a shop assistant', as he put it, 'piping to mothers on a Sunday'. For Menzel, the real subject of the picture was the blazing light of the chandelier, igniting in a flurry of paint. That is what makes him so different from many of the artists in this show - his painting is independent, not hitched to some ideal of German art. </p>",

That is what makes him so different from many of the artists in this show - his painting is independent, not hitched to some ideal of German art.",

In London, Anthony Dowell paid tribute to her as one of the twentieth century's most influential figures in the arts, before touching on his personal memories of her. Foremost among her qualities, he said, was her practicality - there could be no question of cancelling performances to mourn her death. 'Get on with it, dear,' she would have decreed, and so her two companies did, as always, what she wanted. </p> <p>The Royal Ballet's latest programme showcases work by two of its own choreographers: a new ballet by Ashley Page and Kenneth MacMillan's 1972 Triad. Dowell chose to revive Triad for his last season as director because the role of the older brother had been created for him and he wanted to see the ballet again after its 17-year absence. Coincidentally, de Valois had sent MacMillan a cable after Triad 's opening night, saying: 'For me your finest work.' </p> <p>MacMillan's seashore ballet seems an elegy for the end of innocence. Set to Prokofiev's first violin concerto, it recalls the pangs of first love and the pain of being unwanted. Childhood allegiances shift as a girl comes between two brothers. She is drawn to the older one, sending the younger boy wild with a resentment he barely understands. He comes between them with the rage of a child trying to separate parents whose sexual passion excludes him. </p> <p>As danced by Jamie Tapper, the girl is unconsciously provocative. She seems a wanton water creature who tumbles with the two boys like an otter or a mermaid. The older brother (Johan Persson) knows how to handle her. He shows his younger sibling (Edward Watson in the first cast) what the holds are; the boy copies him until his eyes are shielded by his brother's hand: don't look now, this is not for you - yet. </p> <p>Watson lays bare the agony of adolescence - the conviction that life will never come right, that he will never know love. Hectically out of control as a dancer, he makes the ballet come alive; the other two are featureless, their intimacy shutting out the audience as well as the desolate youngster. </p> <p>Ashley Page's This House Will Burn could almost be a projection of the same boy's overheated imagination. It starts with Watson keeling over like a cokehead at a gruesome party. Maybe it's not a party but the overlapping stories of three couples and a child molester. Or a serial murderer and a prostitute. Maybe the two pyromaniac kids fantasised the whole thing. Whatever. </p> <p>Page has taken his inspiration from tantalising paintings by Stephen Chambers (who co-designed the set and costumes with Jon Morrell). This is today's world seen through disturbed children's eyes: adults do strange things to each other, trading partners and identities. Courtship rituals are games of violence whose rules remain a mystery. The nine dancers appear to know what is going on; we cannot focus on their simultaneous activities, which take place in a junkyard of a house, including the proverbial kitchen sink. </p> <p>Orlando Gough has supplied a suitably rackety score, whose jazzy sonorities are punctuated by hoarse cries and grunts. Urged on by the music, the dancers couple with fierce intensity. Each duet is in a different style, bringing out the particular qualities of the astonishing performers; to what end, though, is impossible to tell. After 40 minutes, Johan Kobborg is lit up like a bogeyman, Zenaida Yanowsky climbs the wall, Watson wears a frock and the nameless children have presumably gone for counselling. </p> <p>Birmingham Royal Ballet's dancers and audiences are considerably less challenged by Stanton Welch's Powder, created for the company three years ago. Its revival, like Welch's reputation, is a puzzle even in a low period for choreography. He embroiders Mozart's lucid clarinet concerto with funky footwork, twitching fingers and wagging heads. There is just one coherent solo for Dorcas Walters among meaningless flourishes, impassioned hugs and rushings in and out in fluffy skirts. </p> <p>Welch's lack of rigour is shown up by Balanchine's Concerto Barocco, to Bach's double violin concerto in D minor. BRB's cast are decorous rather than daring but they grasp the logic of dancing these steps to this music. The ballet will teach them how to dance it better, faster, with more surprises. Balanchine is bracingly ruthless - no emoting, no distracting sets or costumes. </p> <p>After 20 minutes (half the length of Page's ballet), the dancers are at the end of their tether and we are left wanting more. </p> <p><strong>Dame Ninette de Valois</strong></p> <p>1898-2001</p> <p>Right to the end, Madam (as Dame Ninette de Valois was known to the Royal Ballet) refused to dwell on her glory days. She was far too concerned with the present, with how and what her two companies were dancing. She questioned visitors for their opinions rather than delivering hers. In her hundredth year she said to me, wickedly: 'I'm interviewing you now, aren't I?' </p> <p>She always had a clear vision of what she wanted to achieve. Her rival as the midwife of British ballet, Marie Rambert, operated on a hand-to-mouth basis; De Valois knew her long-term plan for a national ballet company needed support from the British establishment. She had to communicate her enthusiasm to them as well as build audiences. Above all, she needed to ensure that the institutions she put in place could survive without her. </p> <p>In this, she was wiser than Diaghilev, whose Ballets Russes she joined as a dancer from 1923-25. 'Diaghilev gave us all something, but you took something from him,' one of his former ballerinas told de Valois years later. She took the understanding that a great company had to be founded on a strong classical training, however experimental its choreographers might be. </p> <p>De Valois was a versatile choreographer herself, creating 110 works, 40 of them complete ballets. The two she wanted to be remembered by are Checkmate and The Rake's Progress, which have been shown all over the world.

Oddly, there were all sorts of mildly cheeky, yet laboriously scripted digs, from Cleese about 'Janet's' acting ability ('I told 'em to get Judi Dench'), so one can only assume she was there to wear yet another catsuit and prove herself to be a jolly good sport in the process. </p> <p>Hurley-burlesque costume changes aside, it was possible to watch 50 minutes of The Human Face without learning a single thing one couldn't have picked up from a 10-year-old copy of Cosmo: laughing and smiling is good for you; too much time spent in front of computer screens is alienating and married couples who display sneering expressions of contempt while in each other's company are likely to be heading for divorce... er, run that by me again, John! </p> <p>Cleese is such a national treasure that he could propose a history of toasted sandwiches and the BBC wouldn't hesitate to commission a 10-part series! </p> <p>It's been, oh, easily weeks since the last highly emotive, breast-beating, whither-our-children documentary, but along came Horizon's Taming The Problem Child to scare the hell out of parents, while putting everyone else off procreation. Given the choice between procuring the services of Michael 'Heal the Kids' Jackson as a childminder or hiring American psychologist Dr Ron Federici to tame your troubled offspring, don't hesitate: at least with Jackson the kids would get to pet a llama. </p> <p>In Sussex, five-year-old Hayley's parents were at the end of their tether - mildly autistic and prone to spectacular tantrums, Hayley had been excluded from school for fighting. While in Texas, 12-year-old Sergei had been adopted by an American couple from a Russian orphanage at the age of eight (he had been found wandering the streets of St Petersburg like a stray puppy four years earlier). Sergei's rages were now threatening the very stability of his family. </p> <p>These were two very different cases but Federici chose to treat them exactly the same way: deprived of their 'personality', with books, toys and computer games consigned to packing cases, the two kids were expected to spend several weeks no further than three feet away from their parents, obeying orders at all times. Violations and tantrums were punishable by being held face down on the floor until the children complied, and then in order to recreate what Federici perceives to be a broken parent-child bond responsible for the bad behaviour, there was also enforced hugging. </p> <p>In the event, the hold-downs made for grim viewing and while it was one thing to watch a little girl being forced to sit on her mother's knee, it was quite another to witness burly Sergei being made to do the same: his fury was palpable. In children's homes this kind of behaviour might prompt an investigation, but elsewhere it seems documentary camera crews can stop by to watch. I hasten to qualify this, however, by stressing that Hayley's and Sergei's parents were patently decent well-meaning souls with all the right motivations. In other hands, though, one shivered to think how such a radical course of 'treatment' might be employed. </p> <p>And the outcome was predictable: at five, Hayley was, presumably, sufficiently emotionally and physically malleable to learn the 'correct' responses. She 'improved' at home but once back at school, carried on fighting: 'two steps forward, one step back' reported her mother. Unsurprisingly, Sergei lapsed immediately. Nobody knows about the first four years of Sergei's life (not even Sergei, who has 'forgotten'), but surely any doctor who prescribes treatment for a patient without knowledge of their medical and psychological history is potentially in violation of the code of medical ethics? </p> <p>This was enormously distressing television and I remain entirely ambivalent about whether Horizon should have given Federici the airtime without also carrying a warning. </p> <p>In comparison, Fertility Tourists came as light relief. Here we met the Mastertons, the grieving parents of four sons whose only daughter had died in an accident, and who were now wanting selective fertility treatment to ensure another female child - a procedure outlawed in Britain. To Italy then, where sixtysomething would-be mother Jenny has also been seeking a child. Back in 1992, she was the subject of a documentary in which her Italian doctor was confronted by a pre-peerage Robert Winston, questioning the ethics of assisting post-menopausal women with conception. </p> <p>Jenny, a mildly eccentric retired zoologist, had no doubt it was the right choice, despite the fact that she seemed only to have noticed the lack of a child in her life when it was far too late to have one by normal methods - perhaps it was when she'd stopped working with animals? I couldn't help feeling that if maternal yearnings kick in when you're about to pick up your bus pass, one should probably just shrug and visit Battersea dogs home. Either way, Jenny's treatment has been unsuccessful, even though she says she'll probably still be at it when she's 70 - 'well, why not?' No, Jenny, not 'why not?' but why? </p> <p>Unlike Jenny, the Mastertons could only afford one shot - and it failed. Or rather, though successfully fertilised, the result wasn't female, which was as good as a failure in this case. </p> <p>Though one sympathised with the couple, the lesson seemed to be that four healthy sons could be more than enough children for anybody. Fertility Tourists followed another couple, too - from the Middle East to Harley Street - but their story was entirely dull for the simple reason that, being Muslims who were in defiance of religious law, their faces were necessarily hidden. As Cleese had reminded us, it's very hard to engage with people whose faces you can't see, never mind those who speak only through an interpreter. For all we knew the couple were cracking jokes, but without the close-ups of joy and grief, even the most potentially heart-string-tugging documentary comes across as dry as a medical text. </p> <p>More mad medics, manipulatively-tugged heart-strings and desperate 'our-baby-heartbreak' plots than you could poke a thermometer at in ER, including a premature birth and the resultant breathing doll fighting hopelessly for its spooky little plastic life. </p> <p>Oh and I had intended to review Crossroads (the creaky old 'brand' has been revived as a robust and bustling four-star hotel for no reason other than that soapland's holy grail is the cloistered co-dependent community and we've got enough squares, streets and hospitals already) but, frankly, how many emergency resuscitations can one survive in a week?</p>",

As Cleese had reminded us, it's very hard to engage with people whose faces you can't see, never mind those who speak only through an interpreter. For all we knew the couple were cracking jokes, but without the close-ups of joy and grief, even the most potentially heart-string-tugging documentary comes across as dry as a medical text. More mad medics, manipulatively-tugged heart-strings and desperate 'our-baby-heartbreak' plots than you could poke a thermometer at in ER, including a premature birth and the resultant breathing doll fighting hopelessly for its spooky little plastic life. Oh and I had intended to review Crossroads (the creaky old 'brand' has been revived as a robust and bustling four-star hotel for no reason other than that soapland's holy grail is the cloistered co-dependent community and we've got enough squares, streets and hospitals already) but, frankly, how many emergency resuscitations can one survive in a week?",

You need only say one word - Richter. </p> <p>On Wednesday night, Radio 3 cleared its schedules and devoted the entire evening to the life and work of Sviatoslav Richter, often described as the greatest pianist of the century. There was no particular peg, no anniversary or centenary (Richter was born in the Ukraine in 1915 and died in Moscow four years ago), but pegs are too often an excuse and an event like this needed no excuses. The only requirements for a broadcasting marathon on this scale are a fascinating subject and a presenter who can maintain the listener's interest in said subject for five whole hours without repetition, hesitation or deviation. Fortunately, in Sviatoslav Richter and Sir John Drummond, we had both. </p> <p>Much of Richter's fascination is due to the fact that we in the West knew so little about the legendary Russian musician until he was well into middle age. For political reasons the man who played at Stalin's funeral was not permitted to travel abroad until 1960, when he gave his first international concert in Helsinki. </p> <p>Of the many revealing anecdotes from the programme's contributors - there was a wealth of both - I liked the one about that concert in Finland. At the time, every recording manager in the West was desperate to get Richter to sign a record deal. One enterprising aspirant, having failed to get a ticket to the Helsinki concert, climbed into the hall by a back window and found himself fortuitously in the artist's dressing room. He persuaded Richter to come to Paris to record, the proviso being that there must be at least three pianos for him to choose from - two Steinways from Hamburg and a B\u00f6sendorfer. He loved B\u00f6sendorfers. </p> <p>The great musician arrived in Paris, tinkled, chose one of the Steinways and decided on Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy for his first record. The following morning he was taken ill and remained indisposed for a week. On his return he said he was ready to start, but in the meantime he had changed his mind about the piano; he wanted the B\u00f6sendorfer. This meant major upheavals but eventually they started to record. </p> <p>Richter was a perfectionist insisting on playing on into the night until he considered the piece perfect. At last he was presented with the final edited version. He listened critically and then said: 'Well, I think we'll remake it on the Steinway after all.' </p> <p>It's hard to imagine any other medium but radio, or any other station but Radio 3, giving as comprehensive a portrait of musical genius as this. Drummond paced it perfectly, giving us just the right amount of personal opinion, studio chat, technical analysis, recorded reminiscences from people like Vladimir Ashkenazy, readings from Richter's diary and, of course, punctuating all these, the music. </p> <p>I've contributed to the odd radio programme with musical interludes, during which the guests drink plonk and chat. On Wednesday night you knew that Drummond and his guests were listening as intently to Richter playing Prokofiev, Schumann and Liszt as we were; you could feel their involvement. Drummond's style is uncompromising in that he demands and gets the same commitment from his listeners. His knowledge of his subject is awesome (look at his CV - former director of the Edinburgh Festival, controller of Radio 3, governor of the Royal Ballet) but his manner is so conversational, so intimate, it never intimidates. </p> <p>Programmes like this one remind you - as if you needed it - that Radio 3 is quite simply the most intelligent radio station on earth.</p>",

Amit Lahav - wall-eyed, wild-haired - swerves deliciously between the frenzied and the sepulchral. It features the endlessly transforming Kathryn Hunter, whose character is in turn a fluidly gesturing deaf-mute, a corpse with awkwardly sticking-out limbs, and an appealing wife who pops back, lust-filled, from the dead. It twists between lurid spoof and love story. It trades in puns: while anatomical pictures of a crimson human heart are flashed on to a video screen, a white-frocked siren croons 'Love Letters' ('straight from yo' heart'). Its mood is, you might say, campassionate. </p> <p>And sometimes it's even more extraordinary than that, risking a shift from the scary to the disturbing. At the centre of the action is the wheelchair-bound actor Sophie Partridge, whose legs and arms are not fully grown. She waves a wand above the scrambled action, smiling seraphically, speaking with a snap of steel as she inquires of those around her, on and off the stage: 'Am I really so frightening?' </p> <p>More than once in Northern Broadsides' staging of Shakespeare's King John, war chariots mounted on castors - like giant television trolleys - fluttering with national flags and bearing huge drums, rumble towards each other, while on them English and French beat out great martial rolls. The loud simplicity of this is the essence of a production directed by Barrie Rutter, the company's founder who appears, actor-manager-style, like a latter-day Welles or Hitchcock, in unexpected incarnations in his own productions: here, he is a cardinal, patrolling political exchanges with his head cocked like a bird of prey. </p> <p>Anyone enrolling for the degree in Yorkshire Studies announced this week by Hull University should go at once to Dean Clough: B. Rutter will surely be a module on their course. The Yorkshireness of his company lies only partly in the uniform dialect of the actors, which has proved an enlightening factor in the speaking of Shakespearean verse: why, after all, should Ophelia sound like Princess Anne? </p> <p>It's a thoroughgoing notion of Northernness that's being projected: from the moment when the director signs his introductory notes, in a single bark, 'Rutter', through to the no-nonsense design, with its black body-warmers, bright sashes and a red carpet dropped on to the vaulted cellars of the old mill at Dean Clough. It's as if each actor had been handed notes printed with 'gritty' and 'flinty' in capital letters. And, in the case of King John, 'angry'. Everybody roars. </p> <p>Nevertheless, not for the first time, Northern Broadsides have got on to a good wheeze ahead of the game. It's over a decade since the last major production of King John , a play steeped in political argument but skimpy in the human busyness which makes Shakespeare's other histories so appealing: there are hardly any underlings here, and no bawdy. </p> <p>The richness of the drama is intermittent: it comes from the sound of unusual, eloquent voices. The regal John himself may (as ably shown here by Fine Time Fontayne) be an intellectual and moral weed, but he's surrounded by characters who, though disqualified from power by sex or parentage, command attention. It's not hard to detect a precursor of Shakespeare's Edmund and Richard III in Philip the Bastard, the calculating spin-doctor who ends up by sounding like the voice of principle: Conrad Nelson's rendition is too muted. There's a trio of magnificent women characters, the strongest of which is violently over-played - all heaving bosom and rolling eye - by Marie Louise O'Donnell. </p> <p>By a strange coincidence, at the end of the month King John will also be staged at Stratford. Meanwhile, the RSC have commissioned a series of modern dramas to form a counterpart to the terrific Shakespearean history cycle which has been making the company look once again like a contender. </p> <p> Loveplay is the first of these. Moira Buffini's speculations on English history are snippets strung together on a dogged sex-in-the-absence-of-love theme and an it-was-ever-thus attitude. A sloppy, sniggery opening scene - whose jokes could be refugees from a heavy-handed student skit - features a Roman soldier, an early-English whore and banter about latrines. A far more acute episode - set in a dating agency and starring a pair of wrangling lesbians - closes the sequence of short scenes, proving once again that the taxi driver's - and publisher's reader's - test of a book doesn't work for a play. There may be no good novel which has a terrible first page, but there are plays which begin feebly and get stronger.</p>",

The loud simplicity of this is the essence of a production directed by Barrie Rutter, the company's founder who appears, actor-manager-style, like a latter-day Welles or Hitchcock, in unexpected incarnations in his own productions: here, he is a cardinal, patrolling political exchanges with his head cocked like a bird of prey. Anyone enrolling for the degree in Yorkshire Studies announced this week by Hull University should go at once to Dean Clough: B. Rutter will surely be a module on their course. The Yorkshireness of his company lies only partly in the uniform dialect of the actors, which has proved an enlightening factor in the speaking of Shakespearean verse: why, after all, should Ophelia sound like Princess Anne? It's a thoroughgoing notion of Northernness that's being projected: from the moment when the director signs his introductory notes, in a single bark, 'Rutter', through to the no-nonsense design, with its black body-warmers, bright sashes and a red carpet dropped on to the vaulted cellars of the old mill at Dean Clough. It's as if each actor had been handed notes printed with 'gritty' and 'flinty' in capital letters. And, in the case of King John, 'angry'. Everybody roars. Nevertheless, not for the first time, Northern Broadsides have got on to a good wheeze ahead of the game. It's over a decade since the last major production of King John , a play steeped in political argument but skimpy in the human busyness which makes Shakespeare's other histories so appealing: there are hardly any underlings here, and no bawdy. The richness of the drama is intermittent: it comes from the sound of unusual, eloquent voices. The regal John himself may (as ably shown here by Fine Time Fontayne) be an intellectual and moral weed, but he's surrounded by characters who, though disqualified from power by sex or parentage, command attention. It's not hard to detect a precursor of Shakespeare's Edmund and Richard III in Philip the Bastard, the calculating spin-doctor who ends up by sounding like the voice of principle: Conrad Nelson's rendition is too muted. There's a trio of magnificent women characters, the strongest of which is violently over-played - all heaving bosom and rolling eye - by Marie Louise O'Donnell. By a strange coincidence, at the end of the month King John will also be staged at Stratford. Meanwhile, the RSC have commissioned a series of modern dramas to form a counterpart to the terrific Shakespearean history cycle which has been making the company look once again like a contender. Loveplay is the first of these. Moira Buffini's speculations on English history are snippets strung together on a dogged sex-in-the-absence-of-love theme and an it-was-ever-thus attitude. A sloppy, sniggery opening scene - whose jokes could be refugees from a heavy-handed student skit - features a Roman soldier, an early-English whore and banter about latrines. A far more acute episode - set in a dating agency and starring a pair of wrangling lesbians - closes the sequence of short scenes, proving once again that the taxi driver's - and publisher's reader's - test of a book doesn't work for a play. There may be no good novel which has a terrible first page, but there are plays which begin feebly and get stronger.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Born Romantic</strong> (100 mins, 15) <br>Directed by David Kane; starring Ian Hart, Craig Ferguson, Adrian Lester, Jane Horrocks, Olivia Williams </p> <p><strong> The Watcher</strong> (97 mins, 16) <br>Directed by Joe Charbanic; starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader, Marisa Tomei </p> <p><strong> Dark Days</strong> (86 mins, 15)<br> Directed by Marc Singer </p> <p> Second movies can be difficult. Either you're recovering from a failure or trying to live up to a promising start. David Kane's Born Romantic is a disappointment after his lively 1999 debut This Year's Love, though it too is performed by a gifted cast of familiar faces. It's another tale of the aimless lives of thirtysomethings - the women assertive, the men surlily submissive - drinking, having casual sex and moaning about their relationships. The form is reminiscent of those old portmanteau movies of couples meeting in dance halls like Ealing Studios' Dance Hall and Merchant-Ivory's Roseland. </p> <p>Here three couples in search of romantic love meet in a small east London nightclub called El Corozon exclusively devoted to salsa dancing. Liverpool musician David Morrissey finds his long lost girlfriend (Jane Horrocks) there. A handsome, unemployed Scot (Craig Ferguson), recently divorced, and living in a subsiding house he can't sell, encounters a no-nonsense picture restorer (Olivia Williams). Ineffectual thief Jimi Mistry meets neurotic professional grave-minder Catherine McCormack when he steals her purse while she's sitting it out. The problem is that none of these guys can dance, a metaphor you can take with a pinch of salsa, which is indeed what they all do as they get a handsome Cuban couple to give them lessons. </p> <p>As commentators on this world of the lovelorn we have mini-cab drivers Ian Hart and Adrian Lester. Hart dispenses advice of a Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus sort to fellow customers in the Kismet Caf\u00e9. Lester, a recent widower of great wisdom, hears the confessions of his fares and stops just short of saying 'I had that Claire Rayner in the back of the cab once'. </p> <p>Joe Charbanic comes to feature films from years spent making music videos (some for Dogstar, Keanu Reeves's band) and it shows in his self-consciously arty thriller The Watcher, with every pretentious few seconds in slow motion, speeded up, shown in negative, optically distorted, or shot with a tilted camera. The film is this week's serial killer picture, the mass murderer (Keanu Reeves) being a mad genius who, having driven brilliant FBI agent James Spader crazy in Los Angeles, pursues him to Chicago to commit another series of bizarre killings. Symbiosis is the name of this specious game. </p> <p>Spader is consulting the world's most unlikely shrink (Marisa Tomei) whom we instantly spot as the next victim, though it takes some days for this to dawn on the cops. To stir up his malevolent protagonist, Spader tells him: 'There are five serial killers here in Chicago I could be chasing, and a dozen within a hundred miles - you're just paperwork.' Whether Spader is referring to real murderers or to films currently in production in the Midwest is not clear. </p> <p>Five years ago in Michael Apted's thriller Extreme Measures, a doctor (played by Hugh Grant) discovered that in the bowels of New York, living in abandoned tunnels, shafts and vaults, was a community of homeless derelicts, who were being kidnapped by sinister research scientists for illicit medical experiments. <strong> Dark Days</strong>, a black-and-white documentary by expatriate British filmmaker Marc Singer, shows us that such a band of troglodytes actually exists, or did until very recently. </p> <p>Singer's labour of love is the result of two years he spent living underground with these people in disused Amtrak railway tunnels. Not only are they the subjects of the film but they actually helped to make it, learning to operate the technical equipment, building camera dollies to use on railway tracks, tapping into municipal power cables for lighting. They talk with a curious equanimity about their lives and backgrounds and why they've opted out of the world to live in this rat-infested Stygian ante-room to hell. </p> <p>One describes himself as 'homeless but not hopeless'. Another speaks of spending 'five years of my motherfucking life down this motherfucker'. Picking through the garbage outside a caf\u00e9, a third remarks that 'I only eat what I'm familiar with', adding that kosher restaurants are the best because they don't mix the food up when they throw it out. One of the few women in the group speaks ruefully of a daughter raped at the age of seven who subsequently had an arm cut off, lost a leg and then suffered terrible burns in a ghetto fire. </p> <p>A couple of years ago Amtrak decided to clear the tunnel-dwellers out, presumably as part of Mayor Giuliani's zero tolerance clean-up campaign. Fortunately an organisation called Coalition for the Homeless managed to secure federal housing for them all and we last see them relaxing happily in their new clean well-lighted places.</p>",

David Kane's Born Romantic is a disappointment after his lively 1999 debut This Year's Love, though it too is performed by a gifted cast of familiar faces. It's another tale of the aimless lives of thirtysomethings - the women assertive, the men surlily submissive - drinking, having casual sex and moaning about their relationships. The form is reminiscent of those old portmanteau movies of couples meeting in dance halls like Ealing Studios' Dance Hall and Merchant-Ivory's Roseland. Here three couples in search of romantic love meet in a small east London nightclub called El Corozon exclusively devoted to salsa dancing. Liverpool musician David Morrissey finds his long lost girlfriend (Jane Horrocks) there. A handsome, unemployed Scot (Craig Ferguson), recently divorced, and living in a subsiding house he can't sell, encounters a no-nonsense picture restorer (Olivia Williams). Ineffectual thief Jimi Mistry meets neurotic professional grave-minder Catherine McCormack when he steals her purse while she's sitting it out. The problem is that none of these guys can dance, a metaphor you can take with a pinch of salsa, which is indeed what they all do as they get a handsome Cuban couple to give them lessons. As commentators on this world of the lovelorn we have mini-cab drivers Ian Hart and Adrian Lester. Hart dispenses advice of a Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus sort to fellow customers in the Kismet Caf\u00e9. Lester, a recent widower of great wisdom, hears the confessions of his fares and stops just short of saying 'I had that Claire Rayner in the back of the cab once'. Joe Charbanic comes to feature films from years spent making music videos (some for Dogstar, Keanu Reeves's band) and it shows in his self-consciously arty thriller The Watcher, with every pretentious few seconds in slow motion, speeded up, shown in negative, optically distorted, or shot with a tilted camera. The film is this week's serial killer picture, the mass murderer (Keanu Reeves) being a mad genius who, having driven brilliant FBI agent James Spader crazy in Los Angeles, pursues him to Chicago to commit another series of bizarre killings. Symbiosis is the name of this specious game. Spader is consulting the world's most unlikely shrink (Marisa Tomei) whom we instantly spot as the next victim, though it takes some days for this to dawn on the cops. To stir up his malevolent protagonist, Spader tells him: 'There are five serial killers here in Chicago I could be chasing, and a dozen within a hundred miles - you're just paperwork.' Whether Spader is referring to real murderers or to films currently in production in the Midwest is not clear. Five years ago in Michael Apted's thriller Extreme Measures, a doctor (played by Hugh Grant) discovered that in the bowels of New York, living in abandoned tunnels, shafts and vaults, was a community of homeless derelicts, who were being kidnapped by sinister research scientists for illicit medical experiments. Dark Days, a black-and-white documentary by expatriate British filmmaker Marc Singer, shows us that such a band of troglodytes actually exists, or did until very recently. Singer's labour of love is the result of two years he spent living underground with these people in disused Amtrak railway tunnels. Not only are they the subjects of the film but they actually helped to make it, learning to operate the technical equipment, building camera dollies to use on railway tracks, tapping into municipal power cables for lighting. They talk with a curious equanimity about their lives and backgrounds and why they've opted out of the world to live in this rat-infested Stygian ante-room to hell. One describes himself as 'homeless but not hopeless'. Another speaks of spending 'five years of my motherfucking life down this motherfucker'. Picking through the garbage outside a caf\u00e9, a third remarks that 'I only eat what I'm familiar with', adding that kosher restaurants are the best because they don't mix the food up when they throw it out. One of the few women in the group speaks ruefully of a daughter raped at the age of seven who subsequently had an arm cut off, lost a leg and then suffered terrible burns in a ghetto fire. A couple of years ago Amtrak decided to clear the tunnel-dwellers out, presumably as part of Mayor Giuliani's zero tolerance clean-up campaign. Fortunately an organisation called Coalition for the Homeless managed to secure federal housing for them all and we last see them relaxing happily in their new clean well-lighted places.",

      "body": "<p>It was just after 9 am on a sunny Saturday last June that the Millennium Bridge first began to wobble. Roger Ridsdill-Smith, the young engineer who had been involved with every aspect of the project since his famous paper napkin sketch of a blade of light had so impressed Norman Foster and Anthony Caro, was waiting for the start of a sponsored walk. As the bridge began to fill with people, he spotted the first sign of movement. 'It happened quite fleetingly, but you could tell it wasn't just a judder; it was a resonant movement. 'I thought, 'That's interesting', but as the numbers thinned out, the bridge calmed down again.' </p> <p>Then, at lunch time when the bridge finally opened to the public; the crowds swarmed on from both ends. And that's when the bridge really started to move. All 690 tons of its steel-and-aluminium deck began to sway left and right like a giant, executive desktop toy, so much so that pedestrians, suspended above the Thames on slender steel cables, began to clutch at handrails to steady themselves, and throw themselves against the sway, to stay upright. As they did, so the swings began to get increasingly violent. </p> <p>Ridsdill-Smith and the police working on crowd-control looked at each other. In his mind, Ridsdill-Smith went back over all the calculations, all the safety assessments, all the wind-tunnel tests, even the giant hydraulic tank in Canada used to measure resistance to water. None of them had predicted anything like this. This was simply not supposed to be happening. </p> <p>All his experience as an engineer told him that the bridge ought to be stable and that it was certainly safe. But even he must have seen an image of the great Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge near Tacoma, Washington in 1940, shaking itself to pieces, flashing through his mind. </p> <p>'We asked ourselves, \"Is it dangerous?\" You could see that the movement was self-limiting. Beyond a certain point, it simply becomes impossible to get any more people on the bridge. As it gets fuller and fuller, people stop moving and the effect subsides, long before structural safety limits are reached. We knew it wouldn't fall down, but suppose granny takes a tumble and breaks a hip?' </p> <p>The next day, Nicholas Serota lent the bridge his security staff from the Tate to limit the numbers crossing at any one time. But the wobble didn't go away. The Millennium Bridge Trust hesitated for 24 hours before making the decision to close it altogether. </p> <p>As engineering disasters go, the great wobbly bridge fiasco might seem pretty tame. But to see such a high-profile design closed down so soon after opening was a humiliation for Arup, the fiercely proud engineers who have made everything from the Sydney Opera House to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank possible. They could build skyscrapers and nuclear-power stations all over the world, but here, in their own backyard, they were conspicuously failing to make a simple footbridge stand still long enough for people to stroll across it. </p> <p>What made their embarrassment so irresistible to the more pedantic of their fellow engineers, who rushed in to make judgments about what had happened, was that they seemed to have brought it on themselves. The word was that they had allowed Foster, an architect determined to make his mark on the bridge, push them into flouting the sensible limits of design. 'Of course this bridge was going to wobble, just look at it,' was the consensus. With its low-slung outriggers and its very flat profile, the 'blade of light' looked like no other bridge. It was presented as a piece of typical, too-clever-by-half arrogance. Stray too far from tried-and-tested traditional designs and you'll get in trouble was the subtext of much of the debate. </p> <p>To the enormous relief of both Arup and Foster, it turns out that the striking looks of the bridge have nothing to do with the causes of the wobble. Arup's analysis has been checked by two independent engineers and three university departments. </p> <p>'It's not what is different about the bridge that caused the problem,' says Tony Fitzpatrick, who has lead the Arup team struggling to find a solution. 'Every issue about the bridge that was innovative was properly researched and it worked perfectly. What hit us in the back of the head was that bit of the bridge that was the same as every other long-span bridge. We assumed it would work like other bridges have until now; that was the mistake, but there has to be a first time for everything.' </p> <p>What Arup eventually discovered was a previously misunderstood phenomenon. Once the number of pedestrians on a bridge passes a critical mass, their footsteps start to make it move and the more that they react to that movement to stay upright the more the bridge shakes. It could potentially effect any pedestrian bridge over a given length. Fitzpatrick believes that there are least 70 such bridges in Britain alone, with hundreds more around the world. </p> <p>'We are not ashamed,' says Fitzpatrick, who is presenting Arup's findings in a guidance note to John Prescott's DETR. 'We want the full story to be out there. We are very clear about what we have done; we are happy for others to judge us. Any conspiracy to keep quiet about the bridge only makes us look worse. We have had only one thing on our agenda - to get the bridge open. I just want to be allowed on the bridge to fix it.' </p> <p>As soon as the bridge closed, Arup began talking to the world's footbridge experts in Japan and Germany. At the same time, they did urgent checks to see if the bridge had been built exactly as they had specified - it had - and then they looked yet again at their own calculations to see if there was any elementary mistakes in the numbers. There weren't. </p> <p>All bridges are liable to move. Their weight and structure keep them still to a certain extent, but get enough people walking across a bridge and all the natural damping is cancelled out; then the next few footsteps will set it wobbling violently. It's not a gradual effect. Arup found it's all or nothing. 'Put 1,000 people on a bridge and it will seem to be OK. Put 1,100 and it starts to wobble,' says Fitzpatrick. </p> <p>Arup discovered a number of bridges which had suffered from the problem, and every one of them looked utterly different. There is a high-level suspension bridge in Tokyo, completed in the 1980s, that had a makeshift damping system retrofitted after its opening; a 100-year-old steel truss bridge in Canada that never moved a millimetre in its entire life, until the day of the firework display on its birthday that attracted so many pedestrians that it began to wobble. Then there was was the Pont Solferino, a graceful arched footbridge across the Seine which stayed closed after its opening, ostensibly because its surface was slippery. This, too, turned out to be the victim of wobbly-bridge syndrome. Fitzpatrick hints at a cover-up. 'If the engineers involved with some of these cases had been as open about their bridges as we are being now, the problem would have been resolved long ago.' </p> <p>The best news from Arup's point of view was the footbridge linking the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham to its neighbouring railway station with all the grace and subtlety of a sledgehammer. This was a design clearly untroubled by the least vestige of aesthetic ambition. Yet it, too, suffered from wobbly-bridge syndrome. The avant-garde was off the hook. </p> <p>Why had none of these cases forewarned Arup? Fitzpatrick's answer is that they were never reported to the people who write the codes that bridge designers must follow. </p> <p>Who is to blame? After the few ill-judged words uttered by Foster to the mob of reporters besieging his office on the day of the bridge closure, the various members of the design team are going out of their way to be nice about each other. Foster now says: 'You can only use the word blame in a situation in which somebody says, \"My God, we missed that code, or didn't make that test which anybody else would have done\". That's not what happened here. If you look at the record, much more was done for this bridge than you would reasonably expect. Nobody could ever have anticipated that it would happen to the bridge. In a sense, it is a consequence of its popularity.' </p> <p>Fitzpatrick is clear that responsibility for the bridge is Arup's. 'Norman made it look more people friendly; he made it more sensual than we would have done on our own, but the concept was an engineering one. It certainly wasn't a case of Norman forcing us to make something work.' </p> <p>Once the final signatures are added to a \u00a35 million financial settlement for the bridge (this will avoid any legal action against the design team), work can start on ensuring that the wobble is eliminated. It will involve fitting a pair of X-shaped braces under each of the structural bays under the bridge, along with 37 viscous dampers (the kind of large shock-absorbers you might find on a truck), and another 50 tuned mass dampers. These are heavy blocks that sit in baths of oil and are connected by springs to the structure. When the bridge starts to move, the blocks absorb the energy triggered by pedestrians and stop the wobble. It's all been done deftly enough for the additions to look like part of the original design. </p> <p>How much long-term damage has been done by the bridge's closure? Arup are hoping that their reputation will emerge intact. They were just unlucky to be the first people to face a previously unsuspected problem, just like the engineers who designed the Comets that kept falling out of the sky because of stress fractures that nobody had predicted, or the engineers who built the wartime Liberty ships that kept sinking because nobody could predict the behaviour of the welds used to put them together. </p> <p>And as far as Tate Modern, prime mover in the original bid to build the bridge, is concerned, director Nicholas Serota says: 'It doesn't appear to have deterred visitors from coming, but we were disapppointed that it had to close. The bridge is a symbolic link to the City and it's great that they have found a solution.' </p> <p>Fitzpatrick says he is looking forward to reopening day in six months' time. 'We shall go to watch and enjoy the opening,' he says. One of his more cautious colleagues, the engineer who helped the Atomic Energy Authority test what happened when a train travelling at 100 miles a hour crashed into a flask of nuclear waste, is a little more circumspect. Asked how confident he is about the bridge, he tells you about the day of the nuclear test. 'At the last minute, once the train had started to gather speed on the test track, one of the AEA managers turned to me, and said, \"Are you sure it's going to work?\" I had to think for a minute before I answered.' </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.arup.com/MillenniumBridge\">www.arup.com/MillenniumBridge</a></p>",

We knew it wouldn't fall down, but suppose granny takes a tumble and breaks a hip?' The next day, Nicholas Serota lent the bridge his security staff from the Tate to limit the numbers crossing at any one time. But the wobble didn't go away. The Millennium Bridge Trust hesitated for 24 hours before making the decision to close it altogether. As engineering disasters go, the great wobbly bridge fiasco might seem pretty tame. But to see such a high-profile design closed down so soon after opening was a humiliation for Arup, the fiercely proud engineers who have made everything from the Sydney Opera House to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank possible. They could build skyscrapers and nuclear-power stations all over the world, but here, in their own backyard, they were conspicuously failing to make a simple footbridge stand still long enough for people to stroll across it. What made their embarrassment so irresistible to the more pedantic of their fellow engineers, who rushed in to make judgments about what had happened, was that they seemed to have brought it on themselves. The word was that they had allowed Foster, an architect determined to make his mark on the bridge, push them into flouting the sensible limits of design. 'Of course this bridge was going to wobble, just look at it,' was the consensus. With its low-slung outriggers and its very flat profile, the 'blade of light' looked like no other bridge. It was presented as a piece of typical, too-clever-by-half arrogance. Stray too far from tried-and-tested traditional designs and you'll get in trouble was the subtext of much of the debate. To the enormous relief of both Arup and Foster, it turns out that the striking looks of the bridge have nothing to do with the causes of the wobble. Arup's analysis has been checked by two independent engineers and three university departments. 'It's not what is different about the bridge that caused the problem,' says Tony Fitzpatrick, who has lead the Arup team struggling to find a solution. 'Every issue about the bridge that was innovative was properly researched and it worked perfectly. What hit us in the back of the head was that bit of the bridge that was the same as every other long-span bridge. We assumed it would work like other bridges have until now; that was the mistake, but there has to be a first time for everything.' What Arup eventually discovered was a previously misunderstood phenomenon. Once the number of pedestrians on a bridge passes a critical mass, their footsteps start to make it move and the more that they react to that movement to stay upright the more the bridge shakes. It could potentially effect any pedestrian bridge over a given length. Fitzpatrick believes that there are least 70 such bridges in Britain alone, with hundreds more around the world. 'We are not ashamed,' says Fitzpatrick, who is presenting Arup's findings in a guidance note to John Prescott's DETR. 'We want the full story to be out there. We are very clear about what we have done; we are happy for others to judge us. Any conspiracy to keep quiet about the bridge only makes us look worse. We have had only one thing on our agenda - to get the bridge open. I just want to be allowed on the bridge to fix it.' As soon as the bridge closed, Arup began talking to the world's footbridge experts in Japan and Germany. At the same time, they did urgent checks to see if the bridge had been built exactly as they had specified - it had - and then they looked yet again at their own calculations to see if there was any elementary mistakes in the numbers. There weren't. All bridges are liable to move. Their weight and structure keep them still to a certain extent, but get enough people walking across a bridge and all the natural damping is cancelled out; then the next few footsteps will set it wobbling violently. It's not a gradual effect. Arup found it's all or nothing. 'Put 1,000 people on a bridge and it will seem to be OK. Put 1,100 and it starts to wobble,' says Fitzpatrick. Arup discovered a number of bridges which had suffered from the problem, and every one of them looked utterly different. There is a high-level suspension bridge in Tokyo, completed in the 1980s, that had a makeshift damping system retrofitted after its opening; a 100-year-old steel truss bridge in Canada that never moved a millimetre in its entire life, until the day of the firework display on its birthday that attracted so many pedestrians that it began to wobble. Then there was was the Pont Solferino, a graceful arched footbridge across the Seine which stayed closed after its opening, ostensibly because its surface was slippery. This, too, turned out to be the victim of wobbly-bridge syndrome. Fitzpatrick hints at a cover-up. 'If the engineers involved with some of these cases had been as open about their bridges as we are being now, the problem would have been resolved long ago.' The best news from Arup's point of view was the footbridge linking the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham to its neighbouring railway station with all the grace and subtlety of a sledgehammer. This was a design clearly untroubled by the least vestige of aesthetic ambition. Yet it, too, suffered from wobbly-bridge syndrome. The avant-garde was off the hook. Why had none of these cases forewarned Arup? Fitzpatrick's answer is that they were never reported to the people who write the codes that bridge designers must follow. Who is to blame? After the few ill-judged words uttered by Foster to the mob of reporters besieging his office on the day of the bridge closure, the various members of the design team are going out of their way to be nice about each other. Foster now says: 'You can only use the word blame in a situation in which somebody says, \"My God, we missed that code, or didn't make that test which anybody else would have done\". That's not what happened here. If you look at the record, much more was done for this bridge than you would reasonably expect. Nobody could ever have anticipated that it would happen to the bridge. In a sense, it is a consequence of its popularity.' Fitzpatrick is clear that responsibility for the bridge is Arup's. 'Norman made it look more people friendly; he made it more sensual than we would have done on our own, but the concept was an engineering one. It certainly wasn't a case of Norman forcing us to make something work.' Once the final signatures are added to a \u00a35 million financial settlement for the bridge (this will avoid any legal action against the design team), work can start on ensuring that the wobble is eliminated. It will involve fitting a pair of X-shaped braces under each of the structural bays under the bridge, along with 37 viscous dampers (the kind of large shock-absorbers you might find on a truck), and another 50 tuned mass dampers. These are heavy blocks that sit in baths of oil and are connected by springs to the structure. When the bridge starts to move, the blocks absorb the energy triggered by pedestrians and stop the wobble. It's all been done deftly enough for the additions to look like part of the original design. How much long-term damage has been done by the bridge's closure? Arup are hoping that their reputation will emerge intact. They were just unlucky to be the first people to face a previously unsuspected problem, just like the engineers who designed the Comets that kept falling out of the sky because of stress fractures that nobody had predicted, or the engineers who built the wartime Liberty ships that kept sinking because nobody could predict the behaviour of the welds used to put them together. And as far as Tate Modern, prime mover in the original bid to build the bridge, is concerned, director Nicholas Serota says: 'It doesn't appear to have deterred visitors from coming, but we were disapppointed that it had to close. The bridge is a symbolic link to the City and it's great that they have found a solution.' Fitzpatrick says he is looking forward to reopening day in six months' time. 'We shall go to watch and enjoy the opening,' he says. One of his more cautious colleagues, the engineer who helped the Atomic Energy Authority test what happened when a train travelling at 100 miles a hour crashed into a flask of nuclear waste, is a little more circumspect. Asked how confident he is about the bridge, he tells you about the day of the nuclear test. 'At the last minute, once the train had started to gather speed on the test track, one of the AEA managers turned to me, and said, \"Are you sure it's going to work?\" I had to think for a minute before I answered.'

This call to charm has been taken up by New Yorker Richard Stengel, formerly a senior editor at Time magazine, in his new book You're Too Kind: a Brief History of Flattery (Simon &amp; Schuster \u00a314.99). Stengel argues that while flattery has for a long time had a bad press (no one likes a brown-noser), it actually consists of nothing more sinister than 'strategic praise'.

Chimps, who share 98 per cent of our DNA, use charm with utter ruthlessness to get what they want without offending anyone else. According to Richard Stengel, male chimps vying for group support in power struggles go out of their way to groom females and play with their infants - something which they can never normally be bothered to do. This behaviour, suggests Stengel, has its exact corollary in the campaigning tactics of politicians, who scour provincial branches of Iceland hoping to capture the female vote by kissing sticky babies. </p> <p>Stengel calls charm 'the ultimate victimless crime'. He argues that it is quite distinct from good looks, good manners or the capacity to flatter other people, although it contains healthy dollops of all three. Good looks, certainly, are not essential. What matters is the capacity to manage your body in particular ways during social interaction. For chimps, this means fondling each others' scrotums with just the right amount of \u00e9lan.

Nicholas Coleridge of Cond\u00e9 Nast, which launched Glamour this week, is known not only as one of the shrewdest magazine publishers in the country but as a man of impeccable courtesy (recipients report feeling cherished and charmed). Likewise, one of the nicest things that can be said about the late Princess of Wales is that she never let the sun go down on an unwritten thank you note. </p> <p>Of course, in order for charm to work, it has to follow a few key rules. Charm must be personalised, honed and aimed squarely at the person to whom it is directed. The best charmers make you feel that it is specifically your wit, intelligence and warmth - your charm, in fact - which is keeping them at your side waiting for your next incomparable observation. The moment you feel that there is something prefabricated, one-size-suits-all about the attention coming your way, then you feel diminished, unseen (Robert Kilroy-Silk, at least in his television persona, is the obvious example here). The biggest giveaway is the self-consciously attentive listener who still can't stop herself from glancing around the room to check whether a worthier recipient of her charm has just walked in the door. </p> <p>But if charm needs to feel tailor-made to work, it also has to be heedless of any endgame. There is nothing worse that someone who turns it on to obtain a particular goal (love, promotion, a lift home). Indeed, obviously self-interested charmers resemble nothing so much as Leslie Phillips, circa 1963, investing every 'Well, hello' with a desperate invitation to sex. True charmers, like good flirts, are indiscriminate in their favours and casual about the outcome (they know they can afford to be). They bestow their attentions on cleaning ladies, small boys and dogs without looking for any particular return.

Hayes of Kent</b></p> <p>Given how few (if any) of us are completely honest, it's surprising how reprehensible we believe reading someone else's mail to be, never mind actually opening it. The degree of moral turpitude is on a level with petty theft. We all have secrets, usually shaming ones, and there is a network of freemasonry within family groups which says: 'you leave mine alone and I'll leave yours'.</p> <p>Knowledge is power and perhaps people are afraid that the facades they are at such pains to present to the world will be demolished if they appear in their true light. Also, situations in which someone else controls your letters imply a steep power gradient, such as occur in schools or in authoritarian states.</p> <p>So yes, he's rightly furious. You have used your position of strength, receiving his mail in the sanctum of your own home and prying into it on the basis of this very shaky justification. Is there more to the story than you have let on? If there is a clear distinction between your property and his, it is hard to see why you need protection. 'A good friend' can be a coded name for a lover. Even if he wasn't, as he lived with you people might presume so. You are perhaps concerned that if he is seen as a common-law husband it may not be easy to disentangle your belongings in the eyes of the law.</p> <p>On the whole, this interpretation seems unlikely, but we cannot judge. How long has he lived with you? Is the house your own? How much has he contributed to buying domestic items for mutual use? Why did he move out, and was this directly linked with his imminent bankruptcy?</p> <p>You have resorted to underhand methods to find out (I presume) about whether you are likely to get sucked into the debts and payments which are linked to his insolvency; the act of a person who feels vulnerable. Your interests are opposed to his. If you believe you have cause for concern, grasp the nettle. Get some dispassionate advice from a lawyer. Then make your peace with your ex-lodger, explain your natural concern for your own welfare, and try to clarify things if there is a question of joint property.</p> <p>Remember that his debtors, too, will suffer from his insolvency, probably more than you, and they have a just claim to anything which is currently his.</p> <p><b>Reader's replies</b></p> <p>Give your friend back his responsibility. It is his mail, so stop opening it on his behalf. Redirect the mail to where he is staying.</p> <p>You do not have to take responsibility for his mail and it might help if the Post Office knew he had moved on. <br><b> N.G. of Wilts</b></p> <p>Opening private mail addressed to others is morally justifiable in highly exceptional circumstances when a reply may be urgently needed. Opening a friend's personal mail is not an act of friendship.</p> <p>If your writer is really concerned to protect herself, she/he should ask the friend to make immediate arrangements for post to be re-directed to a new address or to a post office. If nothing happens immediately, she/he should return the post to sender with 'Gone Away' on the envelope.</p> <p>The friend may be 'furious' at these courses of action as well. But it will prevent the temptation to pry into another's life, and will maintain the confidentiality of the friend's private mail. It may also prevent the writer from being unwittingly manipulated by a friend who seems to want to remain hidden.<br><b> P.G.A. of Oxfordshire</b></p> <p><b>Next week's dilemma</b></p> <p>Before I married and had children, I travelled extensively.

Am I morally justified in my actions? A.F. Hayes of Kent Given how few (if any) of us are completely honest, it's surprising how reprehensible we believe reading someone else's mail to be, never mind actually opening it. The degree of moral turpitude is on a level with petty theft. We all have secrets, usually shaming ones, and there is a network of freemasonry within family groups which says: 'you leave mine alone and I'll leave yours'. Knowledge is power and perhaps people are afraid that the facades they are at such pains to present to the world will be demolished if they appear in their true light. Also, situations in which someone else controls your letters imply a steep power gradient, such as occur in schools or in authoritarian states. So yes, he's rightly furious. You have used your position of strength, receiving his mail in the sanctum of your own home and prying into it on the basis of this very shaky justification. Is there more to the story than you have let on? If there is a clear distinction between your property and his, it is hard to see why you need protection. 'A good friend' can be a coded name for a lover. Even if he wasn't, as he lived with you people might presume so. You are perhaps concerned that if he is seen as a common-law husband it may not be easy to disentangle your belongings in the eyes of the law. On the whole, this interpretation seems unlikely, but we cannot judge. How long has he lived with you? Is the house your own? How much has he contributed to buying domestic items for mutual use? Why did he move out, and was this directly linked with his imminent bankruptcy? You have resorted to underhand methods to find out (I presume) about whether you are likely to get sucked into the debts and payments which are linked to his insolvency; the act of a person who feels vulnerable. Your interests are opposed to his. If you believe you have cause for concern, grasp the nettle. Get some dispassionate advice from a lawyer. Then make your peace with your ex-lodger, explain your natural concern for your own welfare, and try to clarify things if there is a question of joint property. Remember that his debtors, too, will suffer from his insolvency, probably more than you, and they have a just claim to anything which is currently his. Reader's replies Give your friend back his responsibility. It is his mail, so stop opening it on his behalf. Redirect the mail to where he is staying. You do not have to take responsibility for his mail and it might help if the Post Office knew he had moved on. N.G. of Wilts Opening private mail addressed to others is morally justifiable in highly exceptional circumstances when a reply may be urgently needed. Opening a friend's personal mail is not an act of friendship. If your writer is really concerned to protect herself, she/he should ask the friend to make immediate arrangements for post to be re-directed to a new address or to a post office. If nothing happens immediately, she/he should return the post to sender with 'Gone Away' on the envelope. The friend may be 'furious' at these courses of action as well. But it will prevent the temptation to pry into another's life, and will maintain the confidentiality of the friend's private mail. It may also prevent the writer from being unwittingly manipulated by a friend who seems to want to remain hidden. P.G.A. of Oxfordshire Next week's dilemma Before I married and had children, I travelled extensively. My husband did not do as much as he would have liked. Now we have a family we have to do 'family-type' holidays. However, my husband finds these hard work and is vocal about the fact he would rather be walking in Iceland or visiting a place he has never been before. I've suggested just the two of us going somewhere together but to be honest, I cannot contemplate leaving the country without my children and walking in Iceland is not really conducive to a four-year-old and a six-month-old baby. He knows this. How can we compromise? N.S. of Reading \u0095 Write to Observer Review or email margaret.cook@observer.co.uk Views on problems must reach us by Wednesday.

Roy Ellis, head of the PCO, uses his bi-weekly passing-out speech to press home the point. 'Never swear at customers,' he warns the eight, neatly suited men who are about to join the ranks of London's 20,000 black cab drivers. 'You never know who you might be swearing at. Chat to them.

Nevertheless, the PCO has maintained a standard of excellence that nowadays is so unusual as to be almost unique. If you conducted a global poll to see in which aspects of life Britain leads the world, the answer would not be public transport, town planning, manufacturing, national cuisine, plumbing, dentistry, nightlife, education or sport. But, by general consent, we do have the best taxi-drivers.</p> <p>London's licensed cabbies are safer, more polite, better trained, better prepared and more knowledgeable than any other taxi drivers on the planet. Whereas elsewhere in the world, driving a cab is something you do while you study to get a proper job as a teacher or actor or novelist, in London, it is the other way round. In fact, there is really only one problem with the capital's black-cab drivers - there's never one when you want one.</p> <p>In 2001, the year in which we had dreamed of visiting the stars, you are more likely to be killed by a meteorite than find a cab in London after 9pm, unless it is in the dead months of January and February, when the city hibernates. Throughout the remainder of the year, the apparent shortage of taxis has become so chronic that even the authorities have noticed. 'There are simply not enough cabs about when you want one,' said Mayor Ken Livingstone recently. 'If it's raining, or if it's late, then the common problem is that you just can't find one.'</p> <p> Thus Livingstone and his American transport supremo, Robert Kiley, have plans to overhaul a licensing system that dates back to the mid-nineteenth century.

The longer it goes on, the worse it gets the Knowledge is like a big jug of water and your brain is like a cup. You pour it in slowly so you don't lose it the Knowledge never stops.'</p> <p>In the literal sense, the Knowledge is the information that a student taxi driver - a 'Knowledge Boy' - is required to learn to be awarded a London taxi licence. The basis of that information are the 400 runs, each one a mental blow, that are contained in the so-called Blue Book. A run is the shortest route between two points that are located within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross. </p> <p>Without doubt, London is the most unplanned big city in the world. There are no grids, blocks or grand avenues, just a complex of seemingly random roads and streets. And even for the casual driver, the desire to understand the chaos can become dangerously absorbing. It's not uncommon for people to spend whole dinner parties in one part of London relaying how they got there from another part. So the appeal of the Knowledge goes beyond the lure of self-employment and a good wage to that of a heroic endeavour - to boldly go where no man would think of going, if it wasn't in the Blue Book.</p> <p>The first and most renowned run in the book is Manor House Station to Gibson Square. Followed by 399 others even more unmemorable. But it's not just the 400 runs, and as many as 25,000 streets, that a Knowledge Boy must commit to memory. All the points of interest along the way and within a quarter of a mile of the start and finish of each run must also memorised. As a point of interest can be anything from a place of worship to a shop, an official building to a nightclub, that amounts to perhaps hundreds of thousands of bits of data and an infinite number of relationships between them all. It is mind-expanding stuff.</p> <p>A study at the department of neurology at University College, London showed that the posterior hippocampi (the elongated ridges on the lateral ventricle of the brain) of a group of London taxi drivers was significantly larger than that of the general population. Dr Eleanor Macguire, the senior research fellow who conducted the experiment, says that there could be a number of explanations but all of them add up to the fact that this part of a taxi driver's brain grows while doing the Knowledge. As he make the links between different roads, so, it seems, the neurons and synapses in the posterior hippocampi make new links.

Taxi drivers have bigger brains than the rest of us. Or do they? It turns out that the growth in the posterior hippocampi was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the anterior hippocampi of the taxi drivers. If the posterior hippocampus is where our spatial information is stored, could it be that the anterior hippocampus houses whatever it is that prevents us from expressing extreme political opinions and pulling U-turns in inconvenient locations? 'I couldn't possibly comment,' said Dr Macguire.</p> <p>You can see why the Knowledge lends itself to metaphor. After a while, the search is not so much geographical as existential. You start out looking for the Samaritan Free Hospital and end up finding yourself. For as well as being a toothache and a jug of water, the Knowledge is a life-changing task that takes upwards of two years to complete. </p> <p>To memorise the routes and points, you have first to acquaint yourself with them in person (most often on a moped), rather than via a map. 'If you can't see it,' they say at the PCO, 'you can't call it.' Many drivers spend five, six or even 10 years mastering the Knowledge (although a very few exceptions have taken as little as a year). And many more fall by the wayside - the drop-out rate is more than two-thirds.</p> <p>The reason some people take more time to finish the Knowledge than doctors take to qualify is that it's not a one-way street. You can go backwards as well as forwards. Each candidate is assessed in a series of 'appearances' before a PCO examiner and depending on how well the appearance goes, the length of time until the next appearance is shortened, extended or unchanged. You start out with 56-day, or sometimes 80-day, gaps between appearances and aim to get down to 21-day gaps to pass out. The effect might be compared to walking blindfold up a down escalator.</p> <p>Although the questions change all the time, a not untypical example of an appearance might be as follows: Noel Road to Liam OGG's; Gallagher &amp; Sons P.H. to Popstars Bar; Beatles Crossing to Oasis Sports Centre; Oscar Wilde's Rooms to Oscar Wilde's Blue Plaque. The method of the Knowledge - reciting the route from one place to another - was once brilliantly spoofed in Viz magazine. Instead of street routes, the cartoon cab drivers were asked to move from one annoying conversational gambit to another. For example: the Spice Girls to And I'd Pull the Lever Myself.</p> <p>It seemed childishly amusing at the time, but now I wonder if it doesn't contain the mystery of that expanding and shrinking hippocampus. Perhaps the necessary corollary of making spatial connections is losing conversational coherence. To put it another way, the taxi driver's compass floats on a white-water stream of consciousness.</p> <p>Roy Ellis told me that he expected the means of assessment to change in the new system. One of life's natural technocrats, who welcomes the challenge of strategic initiatives and report implementations, Ellis has not always been in accord with some of his examiners. For a start, he is a civilian. Not only has he never done the Knowledge, unlike all the examiners, but he has also never been a policeman, unlike all the examiners bar one (who also happens to be the only woman). For many years, the PCO operated as a adjunct to the Metropolitan Police Force, a relationship that is reflected by the Carriage Office itself, a meticulously impersonal building that resembles nothing so much as a police station. </p> <p>A kind of masonic austerity was enforced by the Met veterans in an effort to maintain a rigid code of discipline, much of which still remains. Candidates must wear suits and ties to appearances. 'The difficulty of the questions asked is directly linked to the size of the earring or length of pony tail,' Bishop told me. Examiners are addressed as 'Sir'. Failure to arrive on time results in forfeiting the appearance.</p> <p>'When a guy leaves this office,' said Bishop, a jovial man who wears his pride in the job with a large smile, 'he won't even remember his own name.' One cabbie described it as a terrifying experience. 'A bit like a very nasty version of The Weakest Link.'</p> <p>A Modern Times documentary made four years ago focused on the climate of fear created by the examiners. And the most feared of all examiners was Mr Ormes. A lugubrious character with a bone-dry delivery, Ormes was seen asking one nervous candidate with a criminal record how to get to the Penal Reform Society. He looked and sounded like a copper who had seen it all and didn't believe your story.</p> <p>Ormes disliked Ellis's ideas about changing the appearance of an appearance by making it look more informal. Ellis wanted to rearrange the furniture of the interview-rooms and place a vase of flowers in each of them, so that they would seem less like interrogation-rooms. It was the beginning of the end for Ormes, and it wasn't long before he resigned to become a taxi driver. I met him in the forecourt of St Pancras station, where we sat in the back of his cab. He wore a shirt and tie and his upright posture belied the months and years spent sitting in a vehicle. There was a detectable note of humour in his speech, though, which was emphasised by his resemblance to comic actor Roy Hudd. Ormes was very much against the recent innovation of a written introduction test to the Knowledge, and the proposed use of computers. He argued that they discriminated against the illiterate.</p> <p>'You can smell if people have what is needed,' he explained. Despite describing himself as 'more right wing than Attila the Hun', Ormes felt the answer to speeding up the flow of taxi drivers through the Knowledge was to spend more public money by employing more examiners and extending the appearance time from 15 to 20 minutes. Yet the truth is that most taxi drivers don't want the Knowledge changed, and certainly not made easier, nor do they want more examiners. First, and perhaps understandably, they are unenthusiastic about the idea of new recruits suffering less than themselves. But more than that, the difficulty of the Knowledge naturally restricts the number of licensed drivers and, therefore, most taxi drivers think, ups the number of potential fares. </p> <p>Although no taxi driver will ever admit (at least not to the tax man) to earning more than \u00a330,000 a year, rumours persist that some make double or even treble that amount. 'We don't believe the Knowledge should be tampered with in any way shape or form,' Bob Oddy, head of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, told me. Oddy represents around 6,000 drivers. He is firmly of the opinion that the impetus to get more taxis on the road comes not from frustrated members of the public, left to roam darkened streets with large denomination notes in their fists, but from a conspiracy of taxi-cab manufacturers, rental firms and radio-cab circuits, for whom more cabs equals more money.</p> <p>He also thinks that the reform is somehow linked to the intention, contained in the Private Hire Vehicle London Act of 1998, to license minicabs. Oddy did not fully explain the relationship, but he seemed to suggest that as the PCO will also be responsible for licensing minicabs, its resources will be too stretched to run the Knowledge in its present form, hence the reappraisal. Ellis denies any linkage, although he accepts that the PCO has not yet worked out how it's going to undertake the enormous job of licensing London's growing flotilla of pirate cab firms. The whole problem of lack of cabs, Oddy argues, could be solved by creating a special night tariff. </p> <p>The man who will ultimately decide what to do is Robert Kiley, the new head of Transport for London, brought in from New York by Ken Livingstone in an effort to rethink a transport system that is on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>The fact that responsibility for the PCO has moved from the Metropolitan Police to Livingstone's office is an ideological shift that draws diplomatic grimaces from the old-timers at the PCO. Dave Wetzel, Livingstone's right-hand man and former head of transport at the old GLC, is careful not to exacerbate the situation. 'London taxi drivers can be proud of themselves,' he told me. He also batted away my efforts to draw him on the question of their willingness to share their political viewpoints. But he agreed that the male-dominated, Met-dominated PCO did not fit with his and Livingstone's vision of modern London. 'We don't want a mono-culture. We're looking for change at the Public Carriage Office,' he said. 'But not of any individuals.'</p> <p>Kiley might be a little preoccupied with the Tube system to take much notice of the PCO, but as a onetime inhabitant of New York, where cabs run on a shift system, he might find the idea of taxi drivers knocking off at rush hour rather quaint. At the same time, he will doubtless be impressed by the way that when they're not watching the telly, London cab drivers know where to go, in contrast to their New York colleagues, who seem to know their home town the way I know my way around Pyongyang.</p> <p>I still recall with amazement a New York cab driver upbraiding me because I only knew the address of where I was going and not the route of how to get there. It would be nice if more of us got to benefit from the extraordinary knowledge of the London taxi driver, but it would be a shame if it was at the cost of that knowledge being downgraded. Outside the PCO on an icy morning, I met a middle-aged man named Steve. He was made redundant some years ago and for the past five years he has devoted himself to the Knowledge. He was collecting information from candidates leaving from their appearances, collating a list of questions asked. </p> <p>If he didn't recognise any of the points, he would go and find them on his moped. But he seemed to know them all. He even helped a passing taxi driver, who didn't know the whereabouts of some obscure nightclub. Steve, incredibly, was still on 56-day gaps. My God, I said to him, aren't you fed up?</p> <p>He looked at me with an expression of genuine bemusement. 'No, I love it.'</p> <p><strong>A little knowledge</strong></p> <p><strong> 1633</strong> First recorded plying of coaches for hire in the street. </p> <p><strong> 1694</strong> Parliamentary Act passed to regulate Hackney carriage trade. </p> <p><strong> 1834 </strong> Hansom cabs introduced. </p> <p><strong> 1850</strong> Public Carriage Office opened. </p> <p><strong> 1851</strong> Knowledge is introduced. </p> <p><strong> 1903</strong> The first petrol-driven cab took to the road. </p> <p><strong> 1907 </strong> Taximeter introduced. </p> <p><strong> 1952</strong> First diesel cab. </p> <p>To become a London taxi driver, you must be: over 21; of good character; fit, physically and mentally; and have a thorough knowledge of London.

'When a guy leaves this office,' said Bishop, a jovial man who wears his pride in the job with a large smile, 'he won't even remember his own name.' One cabbie described it as a terrifying experience. 'A bit like a very nasty version of The Weakest Link.' A Modern Times documentary made four years ago focused on the climate of fear created by the examiners. And the most feared of all examiners was Mr Ormes. A lugubrious character with a bone-dry delivery, Ormes was seen asking one nervous candidate with a criminal record how to get to the Penal Reform Society. He looked and sounded like a copper who had seen it all and didn't believe your story. Ormes disliked Ellis's ideas about changing the appearance of an appearance by making it look more informal. Ellis wanted to rearrange the furniture of the interview-rooms and place a vase of flowers in each of them, so that they would seem less like interrogation-rooms. It was the beginning of the end for Ormes, and it wasn't long before he resigned to become a taxi driver. I met him in the forecourt of St Pancras station, where we sat in the back of his cab. He wore a shirt and tie and his upright posture belied the months and years spent sitting in a vehicle. There was a detectable note of humour in his speech, though, which was emphasised by his resemblance to comic actor Roy Hudd. Ormes was very much against the recent innovation of a written introduction test to the Knowledge, and the proposed use of computers. He argued that they discriminated against the illiterate. 'You can smell if people have what is needed,' he explained. Despite describing himself as 'more right wing than Attila the Hun', Ormes felt the answer to speeding up the flow of taxi drivers through the Knowledge was to spend more public money by employing more examiners and extending the appearance time from 15 to 20 minutes. Yet the truth is that most taxi drivers don't want the Knowledge changed, and certainly not made easier, nor do they want more examiners. First, and perhaps understandably, they are unenthusiastic about the idea of new recruits suffering less than themselves. But more than that, the difficulty of the Knowledge naturally restricts the number of licensed drivers and, therefore, most taxi drivers think, ups the number of potential fares. Although no taxi driver will ever admit (at least not to the tax man) to earning more than \u00a330,000 a year, rumours persist that some make double or even treble that amount. 'We don't believe the Knowledge should be tampered with in any way shape or form,' Bob Oddy, head of the Licensed Taxi Driver Association, told me. Oddy represents around 6,000 drivers. He is firmly of the opinion that the impetus to get more taxis on the road comes not from frustrated members of the public, left to roam darkened streets with large denomination notes in their fists, but from a conspiracy of taxi-cab manufacturers, rental firms and radio-cab circuits, for whom more cabs equals more money. He also thinks that the reform is somehow linked to the intention, contained in the Private Hire Vehicle London Act of 1998, to license minicabs. Oddy did not fully explain the relationship, but he seemed to suggest that as the PCO will also be responsible for licensing minicabs, its resources will be too stretched to run the Knowledge in its present form, hence the reappraisal. Ellis denies any linkage, although he accepts that the PCO has not yet worked out how it's going to undertake the enormous job of licensing London's growing flotilla of pirate cab firms. The whole problem of lack of cabs, Oddy argues, could be solved by creating a special night tariff. The man who will ultimately decide what to do is Robert Kiley, the new head of Transport for London, brought in from New York by Ken Livingstone in an effort to rethink a transport system that is on the verge of collapse. The fact that responsibility for the PCO has moved from the Metropolitan Police to Livingstone's office is an ideological shift that draws diplomatic grimaces from the old-timers at the PCO. Dave Wetzel, Livingstone's right-hand man and former head of transport at the old GLC, is careful not to exacerbate the situation. 'London taxi drivers can be proud of themselves,' he told me. He also batted away my efforts to draw him on the question of their willingness to share their political viewpoints. But he agreed that the male-dominated, Met-dominated PCO did not fit with his and Livingstone's vision of modern London. 'We don't want a mono-culture. We're looking for change at the Public Carriage Office,' he said. 'But not of any individuals.' Kiley might be a little preoccupied with the Tube system to take much notice of the PCO, but as a onetime inhabitant of New York, where cabs run on a shift system, he might find the idea of taxi drivers knocking off at rush hour rather quaint. At the same time, he will doubtless be impressed by the way that when they're not watching the telly, London cab drivers know where to go, in contrast to their New York colleagues, who seem to know their home town the way I know my way around Pyongyang. I still recall with amazement a New York cab driver upbraiding me because I only knew the address of where I was going and not the route of how to get there. It would be nice if more of us got to benefit from the extraordinary knowledge of the London taxi driver, but it would be a shame if it was at the cost of that knowledge being downgraded. Outside the PCO on an icy morning, I met a middle-aged man named Steve. He was made redundant some years ago and for the past five years he has devoted himself to the Knowledge. He was collecting information from candidates leaving from their appearances, collating a list of questions asked. If he didn't recognise any of the points, he would go and find them on his moped. But he seemed to know them all. He even helped a passing taxi driver, who didn't know the whereabouts of some obscure nightclub. Steve, incredibly, was still on 56-day gaps. My God, I said to him, aren't you fed up? He looked at me with an expression of genuine bemusement. 'No, I love it.' A little knowledge 1633 First recorded plying of coaches for hire in the street. 1694 Parliamentary Act passed to regulate Hackney carriage trade. 1834 Hansom cabs introduced. 1850 Public Carriage Office opened. 1851 Knowledge is introduced. 1903 The first petrol-driven cab took to the road. 1907 Taximeter introduced. 1952 First diesel cab. To become a London taxi driver, you must be: over 21; of good character; fit, physically and mentally; and have a thorough knowledge of London. The 'All London' licence requires a detailed knowledge of the 25,000 streets within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross with a more general knowledge of the major arterial routes throughout the rest of London. Cabs around the world New York There are 40,000 licensed taxi drivers and 11,787 licensed cabs in New York City. Drivers work shifts and let their cabs to other drivers. Paris There are 8,474 plate holders in Paris who are the owners of their vehicles. New Delhi The only requirement for a Delhi taxi driver is to have a driving licence. There is no body governing cabs and no legislation covering quality of cars. Rome There is a long waiting list for the strictly limited number of licences in Rome. Hopefuls must wait for a driver to retire or die before taking their place. They must then take a strict geography test. Kim Bunce",

      "byline": "Kathryn Flett",

      "body": "<p>I don't like pubs, but I love the Eagle. When I first came to work in London EC1 in the early 90s, the area wasn't exactly the gastrohub and oasis of grooviness it is now - though it certainly seemed to have its own microclimate. Before the designer-loft explosion, back in the days when Exmouth Market was scented by Special Brew rather than Calvin Klein, my memory of life in and around the Farringdon Road is of a relentlessly dour raininess, with lunchtimes posing a considerable challenge to those of us for whom a sad sandwich or pie didn't exactly hit the spot. </p> <p>I cannot imagine what life must have been like for the hungry worker with pernickety taste buds in Farringdon pre-Eagle, but my generation got very lucky when, in 1991, the local pub evolved into a kind of London 'Cheers' with knobs on. At the Eagle, not only did everybody know your name, they also knew that you were very particular about consuming your luncheon sausage and mash or steak sandwich with a dollop of Dijon mustard. And, in no uncertain terms, they'd roll their eyes and tell you to bring your own. If you must. </p> <p>Situated on a glamour-lite corner site opposite a fine example of NCP car-park vernacular architecture, the Eagle boasted charm in abundance. Admittedly, this was a bullshit-free, rough-edged sort of urban charm, but it was a charm to be cherished. And now, a decade down the line, the Eagle has changed barely at all, which is a compliment because, I think, one of the things that makes a great pub is a sense of continuity. While time might have been expected to erase all traces of previous staff, menus and punters, at the Eagle this just isn't the case - the walls may get a paint job every year, but it's always the same comfy shade of clotted cream. And it may be that hundreds of wooden chairs have died and been replaced (indeed I may even have despatched one or two of them myself in moments of extreme exhaustion and emotion), but new furniture for the sake of new furniture? Fashion for the hell of it? Not at the Eagle - and thank God for that. </p> <p>And the food. At the Eagle I have eaten something approaching tons of very fine, no-fuss modern food: zingy salt cod, delicately aromatic pastas, robust and (literally) heartwarming soups, not to mention countless steaks, chickens, salads and sausages... meals characterised by David Eyre's original culinary blueprint: top-quality ingredients prepared with exemplary ease and simplicity and served in satisfyingly old-fashioned portions. It seems extraordinary, but just a decade ago these were rare and elusive qualities in London dining and completely unheard of within the context of pub dining. In the early 90s, of course, London was in a recession and it is no exaggeration to say that the Eagle pioneered a welcome move </p> <p>It was goodbye to the sort of foodie fads which saw \u00a3100-per-head meals of midget portions, au revoir to nouvelle cuisine and a very big hello to modern comfort food. </p> <p>On a personal note, while I was editing Arena magazine between 1992 and 1995, the Eagle was the staff canteen of our dreams - here meetings were conducted, copy written and edited, arguments raged, staff departures mourned, staff arrivals celebrated... The Eagle was so much a part of the fabric of our working lives that it seemed entirely logical to ask David Eyre to write the magazine's food column. At that time the idea of a regular cookery slot in a men's glossy magazine was still pretty left-field. We were soon vindicated, however, because suddenly everybody was at it - cooking was the new sex (if not actually the new rock'n'roll) and sometimes David even met his deadlines. Happy days! </p> <p>Then, in 1995, I left Arena and moved all the way across the Farringdon Road to The Observer. At the time a friend of mine suggested that a prime motivation in taking the job was 'so you can still have lunch at the Eagle'. Well, obviously. In the last 10 years I have quenched numerous cruel thirsts with a glass of Chilean Chardonnay and sated innumerable yawning hungers with the most satisfying Eagle meals. For me, the Eagle has provided many of the finest flavours, tastes and smells during a decade of working and playing, loving and losing, crying and laughing and, it must be said, occasionally falling over. Particularly on the way downstairs to the lavatory. Thanks, then, to David and Michael and the ever-evolving Eagle team spirit. Believe me, it really can't be beat - and now, with the arrival of Big Flavours and Rough Edges , we can all take it home and eat it, too.</p> <p><strong> Root vegetable soup with greens</strong><br> </p> <p> Simple broths thickened with potato and stale bread are known in Italy as pancotto. The more root vegetables you add the better, but potatoes and onions alone will do the trick. The greens, too, are open to interpretation. In the winter months, choose hardy brassica, such as Savoy cabbage or Brussels sprout tops. In the summer, use young spinach, rocket or even herbs. Chervil and flat-leaf parsley work best. You do not need stock for this soup - sweating several vegetables together with oil and a little water will give you all the flavour you need. But feel free to use chicken or vegetable stock if you want to. Serves 6. Recipe by Tom Norrington-Davies </p> <p><strong>3 tbsp olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>3 onions, chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>2 garlic cloves, peeled and slightly crushed </strong></p> <p><strong>2 large floury potatoes (baking potatoes or 'whites'), peeled and roughly diced </strong></p> <p><strong>about 500g vegetables, such as turnips, parsnips, celeriac, fennel and leeks, peeled and diced (the more anaemic looking the better, so avoid pumpkin, beetroot and carrots) </strong></p> <p><strong>a mugful of water </strong></p> <p><strong>about 100g stale, rustic-style bread, such as sourdough or ciabatta, with the crusts removed </strong></p> <p><strong>3 generous handfuls of chopped greens </strong></p> <p><strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper </strong></p> <p><strong>extra-virgin olive oil, to serve </strong></p> <p>Gently heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan, add the onions and garlic and fry until soft, without browning. Add the potatoes and other vegetables, plus a couple of pinches of salt and about half the mug of water. Stir thoroughly and cover. Leave to simmer gently for about 20 minutes or until all the vegetables are tender. Add the stale bread and a little more water. When the bread has gone soft, gently mash everything together and start to add more water until you have the consistency you want. Remember, it should be broth-like enough to be able to cook the greens in it. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </p> <p>Bring the soup to a simmer again and add the greens. If using cabbage, the soup will need another 5 minutes' simmering. If using herbs or rocket, serve immediately. Garnish each bowlful with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. </p> <p><strong> Variations</strong></p> <p>1. Meat eaters can include bacon in the soup. It should be added to the pot with the onions and garlic. </p> <p>2. If there is Parmesan or pecorino in the fridge, grate some and put it in a bowl on the table when you serve the soup. </p> <p>3. Pancotto made with rocket is traditionally garnished with crushed dried chillies as well as with the extra-virgin olive oil.</p> <p><strong> Escalivada - Spanish roast-vegetable salad</strong><br> </p> <p> This dish isn't sure if it's a salad or a stew, but it is lovely both as an accompaniment to meat or fish and as a dish on its own. If you can cook the vegetables on an open fire or barbecue, so much the better, as the flavour will be much improved. Otherwise, roast them in a hot oven. Serves 4-6. Kate Lewis </p> <p><strong>2 large baking potatoes </strong><br> <strong>3 aubergines </strong><br> <strong>3 red peppers </strong><br> <strong>2 red onions </strong><br> <strong>extra-virgin olive oil </strong><br> <strong>10 basil leaves, torn </strong><br> <strong>2 courgettes, cut into 2cm pieces </strong><br> <strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper </strong></p> <p>Pierce the skin of each potato and aubergine 3 or 4 times with a fork or sharp knife. Place all the vegetables except the courgettes on a baking sheet and roast on the top shelf of an oven preheated to 220 C/gas mark 7, until they are cooked through and the skins are evenly coloured (or roast them over a hot fire or barbecue). The peppers and aubergines will need 20-30 minutes and the potatoes and onions up to an hour. When the vegetables are cool enough to handle, peel them and roughly break them into large chunks. </p> <p>Dress the aubergines and potatoes generously with olive oil, salt, pepper and some of the torn basil and mix together in a serving dish. </p> <p>Season the courgettes and then fry them in olive oil until lightly coloured and tender. Lay them on top of the aubergine and potatoes with the peppers and onions. Season well, add the remaining basil and dress with more olive oil. Serve hot or at room temperature.</p> <p><strong> Paella Valenciana</strong><br> </p> <p> Paella originated in Valencia and its name derives from paellera , the wide, shallow, two-handled pan in which it is cooked. Contrary to what most people think, it was originally made with meat, but these days shellfish is more popular. There are so many different theories about the right way to make paella that it's difficult to know which, if any, to accept. I will explain the main points here and leave the rest to your own interpretation. </p> <p>Traditionally, calasparra rice is used. This is difficult to find unless you know of a Spanish shop, but it is similar to the Italian arborio rice, which is stocked by most supermarkets. Like arborio, calasparra is a round-grain rice which takes longer to cook than long-grain rice, such as basmati. It absorbs liquid very slowly and then, when the grains have swelled, they release their starch all at once. Unlike a risotto, all the liquid is added to a paella in one go rather than in stages. You need a large flame, so if you don't have a big burner on your cooker, it is probably best done on a barbecue. Serves 4-6. Recipe by Carlos Vargas </p> <p><strong>2 \u00f1oras (Spanish sweet dried peppers, also known as romescos), or 1 red pepper, chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>150ml olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>500g boneless chicken, cut into small pieces </strong></p> <p><strong>100g boneless pork (leg or loin), cut into small pieces </strong></p> <p><strong>1 small onion, finely chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>1 small carrot, finely chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>2 green peppers, chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>150g fresh butter beans (or drained and rinsed tinned ones) </strong></p> <p><strong>50g peas </strong></p> <p><strong>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>3 or 4 tomatoes, skinned and finely chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>100g live snails (or use scrubbed cockles or clams if you can't get live, purged snails) </strong></p> <p><strong>100g cooked ham, diced </strong></p> <p><strong>500g calasparra or arborio rice </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp paprika </strong></p> <p><strong>a pinch of saffron strands </strong></p> <p><strong>1 litre hot chicken stock </strong></p> <p><strong>juice of 1 lemon </strong></p> <p><strong>salt </strong></p> <p><strong>lemon wedges, to serve </strong></p> <p>If using \u00f1oras, soak them in hot water for an hour, then drain and tear them into pieces. Heat the olive oil in a paellera at least 40cm in diameter. Add the chicken and pork and fry until browned all over, then remove from the pan with a slotted spoon. Stir in the onion, carrot, green peppers, butter beans, peas, garlic and \u00f1oras and cook until softened. Then add the tomatoes and wait until the juice runs, stirring several times. </p> <p>Add the snails (or cockles or clams) and ham. The heat will make the snails come out of their shells; at that moment, add the rice. Stir well, return the chicken and pork to the pan and add the paprika and about 2 tsp salt. Fry the mixture for 2 or 3 minutes so that the rice starts to catch, then add the saffron to the hot stock and pour it into the pan. </p> <p>When the paella starts to boil, add the lemon juice and turn the heat to low (the lemon prevents the rice becoming too sticky). It's best not to stir the paella now. Instead, move the pan occasionally so the heat is evenly distributed. When the rice is cooked (after about 15 minutes), cover with foil and leave to rest for 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning if necessary, then serve with lemon wedges.</p> <p><strong> Grilled tuna with salmoriglio and new potatoes</strong><br> </p> <p> Salmoriglio is a southern-Italian herb sauce that goes well with grilled fish and meat. It is strongly flavoured and should be treated with respect. Use the best olive oil you can afford. I have made it with oregano here, but you can also make a very flavourful thyme salmoriglio as long as you use young, green thyme that will crush to a paste easily. When buying the tuna, make sure you get fresh, not frozen, loin and ask the fishmonger to slice it for you rather than buying it ready sliced. Check that the fish doesn't look old and tired or grey, but has a shiny complexion. It can be quite dark or pale, depending on which part of the loin and what type of tuna it is. Recipe by Jake Hodges.</p> <p><strong>675g new potatoes such as Jersey Royals, or waxy potatoes, scrubbed clean </strong></p> <p><strong>a sprig of mint (optional) </strong></p> <p><strong>red-wine vinegar, olive oil and chopped herbs for dressing the potatoes (optional) </strong></p> <p><strong>4 x 150g fresh tuna steaks, about 1.5cm thick </strong></p> <p><strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper </strong></p> <p>for the salmoriglio</p> <p><strong>cup of clean, well-dried oregano leaves </strong></p> <p><strong>1 heaped tsp Maldon sea salt </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp lemon juice </strong></p> <p><strong>6-8 tbsp good olive oil </strong></p> <p>First make the salmoriglio: put the oregano leaves and salt in a pestle and mortar and crush to a smooth paste. Mix in the lemon juice, then gradually add enough olive oil to make an emulsion. </p> <p>Put the potatoes in a pan of cold water with some salt and the mint, if using, and bring to the boil. Simmer until tender, then drain well. If you like, toss the cooked potatoes with a few shakes of very fine red-wine vinegar and then with a little olive oil and whatever chopped herbs you fancy. I would probably use flat-leaf parsley and maybe a little mint, but there is no reason why you shouldn't use coriander, rocket or whatever else you have to hand.</p> <p><strong> Lamb shanks with chickpeas</strong><br> </p> <p>A dish for patient people. The key to tasty lamb shanks and soft chickpeas is time - lots of it. The meat should be cooked until it is almost falling off the bone; the chickpeas should be creamy, with very little bite. This dish is quite brothy - the stock pretty much makes itself, due to the long cooking process. Serves 6. Tom Norrington-Davies </p> <p><strong>5 tbsp olive oil </strong><br> <strong>6 lamb shanks </strong><br> <strong>2 large onions, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>3 leeks, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>3 celery sticks, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>about bottle of white wine </strong><br> <strong>1 tsp dried mint </strong><br> <strong>a generous pinch of saffron </strong><br> <strong>2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e </strong><br> <strong>about 250g chickpeas, soaked in cold water overnight, or 2 x 400g tins of chickpeas (look for a brand that adds nothing but salt and water) </strong><br> <strong>a bunch of parsley or coriander, chopped </strong><br> <strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper </strong></p> <p>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a fierce heat. Brown the lamb shanks in it, then put them to one side. Pour the fat and juices from the pan into a large casserole and use them to fry the onions, garlic, leeks and celery, adding a little more oil if you need to. When the vegetables have softened but not browned, add the wine, mint and saffron. As soon as it is bubbling, stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e. Add the lamb shanks and turn to coat them with the other ingredients. Add enough water for the shanks to be just about covered, but not swimming. Cover and cook over a low heat for about 2 hours. </p> <p>Meanwhile, deal with the chickpeas, if you are using dried ones. Drain them of their soaking water, put them in a large pan of unsalted water and bring to the boil. Boil them rapidly for 10 minutes, then drain again. Now cover them with fresh water again and simmer until tender. The best way to get chickpeas right is to keep tasting the odd one. If the water evaporates before the chickpeas are tender, just add more boiling water from the kettle. </p> <p>When the lamb has been cooking for about 2 hours, add the chickpeas and enough of their cooking liquid to cover. If they look as if they will swamp the stew, don't add them all. Continue cooking until the lamb is tender and the chickpeas are a little overcooked (make sure the stew does not dry out - add a little more liquid if necessary). Serve in bowls with plenty of the liquid, garnished with the parsley or coriander and accompanied by some good bread for mopping up the juices.</p> <p><strong> Casseroled beef with cinnamon, thyme and shallots</strong><br> </p> <p> A rich beef stew in the classic manner. This method can be used with almost any appropriate ingredients. I can't remember where I came across cinnamon as something good for beef stews but its sweetness is very welcome. As for shallots - well, beef and onions is a famous combination. Possible additions or substitutions include olives, juniper berries and small white onions; brandy or more red wine could be used instead of the vinegar. Serves 6-8. David Eyre </p> <p><strong>100g streaky bacon, chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>100g salt pork fat (sold as lardo salato in Italian grocers), washed and chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>1.5kg shin of beef, cut into 3cm cubes </strong></p> <p><strong>glass of red-wine vinegar </strong></p> <p><strong>olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>10 shallots, peeled but left whole with the root intact (you may find it easier to peel them if they are soaked in cold water first) </strong></p> <p><strong>5 fat garlic cloves, peeled but left whole </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e </strong></p> <p><strong>a handful of flat-leaf parsley, chopped, plus extra to garnish </strong></p> <p><strong>2 fresh bay leaves </strong></p> <p><strong>a large sprig of thyme </strong></p> <p><strong>2 strips of orange peel </strong></p> <p><strong>2 cinnamon sticks </strong></p> <p><strong>2 glasses of strong red wine </strong></p> <p><strong>water or meat stock </strong></p> <p><strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper </strong></p> <p>Slowly melt the streaky bacon and pork fat in a wide, heavy casserole. Take the bacon out and put it in a warm bowl. Brown the beef in the pan - in batches, if necessary - then add it to the bacon in the bowl. </p> <p>Pour the red-wine vinegar into the hot pan and stir to deglaze, letting it bubble until slightly reduced. Pour it over the meat. Heat some olive oil in the pan, add the shallots and garlic cloves with some salt and a generous amount of black pepper and fry for a few minutes over a moderate heat. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and chopped parsley and cook for a minute longer, then return the meat to the pan with any resulting juices. </p> <p>Make a bouquet of the bay, thyme and orange peel and bury it in the pot with the cinnamon sticks. Heat the red wine, then pour it over the meat and add enough water or stock to bring the level of the liquid to no more than an inch below the surface of the meat. Cover the meat with an inner lid made of foil and then a close-fitting pan lid. Turn the heat to very low or place in a slow oven (150 C/gas mark 2). It will take around 3 hours to cook, but I would cook it for 2 hours one day, refrigerate it and then finish it the next. Garnish with lots of roughly chopped parsley. </p> <p>\u0095 Nigel Slater returns in two weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I don't like pubs, but I love the Eagle. When I first came to work in London EC1 in the early 90s, the area wasn't exactly the gastrohub and oasis of grooviness it is now - though it certainly seemed to have its own microclimate. Before the designer-loft explosion, back in the days when Exmouth Market was scented by Special Brew rather than Calvin Klein, my memory of life in and around the Farringdon Road is of a relentlessly dour raininess, with lunchtimes posing a considerable challenge to those of us for whom a sad sandwich or pie didn't exactly hit the spot. I cannot imagine what life must have been like for the hungry worker with pernickety taste buds in Farringdon pre-Eagle, but my generation got very lucky when, in 1991, the local pub evolved into a kind of London 'Cheers' with knobs on. At the Eagle, not only did everybody know your name, they also knew that you were very particular about consuming your luncheon sausage and mash or steak sandwich with a dollop of Dijon mustard. And, in no uncertain terms, they'd roll their eyes and tell you to bring your own. If you must. Situated on a glamour-lite corner site opposite a fine example of NCP car-park vernacular architecture, the Eagle boasted charm in abundance. Admittedly, this was a bullshit-free, rough-edged sort of urban charm, but it was a charm to be cherished. And now, a decade down the line, the Eagle has changed barely at all, which is a compliment because, I think, one of the things that makes a great pub is a sense of continuity. While time might have been expected to erase all traces of previous staff, menus and punters, at the Eagle this just isn't the case - the walls may get a paint job every year, but it's always the same comfy shade of clotted cream. And it may be that hundreds of wooden chairs have died and been replaced (indeed I may even have despatched one or two of them myself in moments of extreme exhaustion and emotion), but new furniture for the sake of new furniture? Fashion for the hell of it? Not at the Eagle - and thank God for that. And the food. At the Eagle I have eaten something approaching tons of very fine, no-fuss modern food: zingy salt cod, delicately aromatic pastas, robust and (literally) heartwarming soups, not to mention countless steaks, chickens, salads and sausages... meals characterised by David Eyre's original culinary blueprint: top-quality ingredients prepared with exemplary ease and simplicity and served in satisfyingly old-fashioned portions. It seems extraordinary, but just a decade ago these were rare and elusive qualities in London dining and completely unheard of within the context of pub dining. In the early 90s, of course, London was in a recession and it is no exaggeration to say that the Eagle pioneered a welcome move It was goodbye to the sort of foodie fads which saw \u00a3100-per-head meals of midget portions, au revoir to nouvelle cuisine and a very big hello to modern comfort food. On a personal note, while I was editing Arena magazine between 1992 and 1995, the Eagle was the staff canteen of our dreams - here meetings were conducted, copy written and edited, arguments raged, staff departures mourned, staff arrivals celebrated... The Eagle was so much a part of the fabric of our working lives that it seemed entirely logical to ask David Eyre to write the magazine's food column. At that time the idea of a regular cookery slot in a men's glossy magazine was still pretty left-field. We were soon vindicated, however, because suddenly everybody was at it - cooking was the new sex (if not actually the new rock'n'roll) and sometimes David even met his deadlines. Happy days! Then, in 1995, I left Arena and moved all the way across the Farringdon Road to The Observer. At the time a friend of mine suggested that a prime motivation in taking the job was 'so you can still have lunch at the Eagle'. Well, obviously. In the last 10 years I have quenched numerous cruel thirsts with a glass of Chilean Chardonnay and sated innumerable yawning hungers with the most satisfying Eagle meals. For me, the Eagle has provided many of the finest flavours, tastes and smells during a decade of working and playing, loving and losing, crying and laughing and, it must be said, occasionally falling over. Particularly on the way downstairs to the lavatory. Thanks, then, to David and Michael and the ever-evolving Eagle team spirit. Believe me, it really can't be beat - and now, with the arrival of Big Flavours and Rough Edges , we can all take it home and eat it, too. Root vegetable soup with greens Simple broths thickened with potato and stale bread are known in Italy as pancotto. The more root vegetables you add the better, but potatoes and onions alone will do the trick. The greens, too, are open to interpretation. In the winter months, choose hardy brassica, such as Savoy cabbage or Brussels sprout tops. In the summer, use young spinach, rocket or even herbs. Chervil and flat-leaf parsley work best. You do not need stock for this soup - sweating several vegetables together with oil and a little water will give you all the flavour you need. But feel free to use chicken or vegetable stock if you want to. Serves 6. Recipe by Tom Norrington-Davies 3 tbsp olive oil 3 onions, chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled and slightly crushed 2 large floury potatoes (baking potatoes or 'whites'), peeled and roughly diced about 500g vegetables, such as turnips, parsnips, celeriac, fennel and leeks, peeled and diced (the more anaemic looking the better, so avoid pumpkin, beetroot and carrots) a mugful of water about 100g stale, rustic-style bread, such as sourdough or ciabatta, with the crusts removed 3 generous handfuls of chopped greens salt and freshly ground black pepper extra-virgin olive oil, to serve Gently heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan, add the onions and garlic and fry until soft, without browning. Add the potatoes and other vegetables, plus a couple of pinches of salt and about half the mug of water. Stir thoroughly and cover. Leave to simmer gently for about 20 minutes or until all the vegetables are tender. Add the stale bread and a little more water. When the bread has gone soft, gently mash everything together and start to add more water until you have the consistency you want. Remember, it should be broth-like enough to be able to cook the greens in it. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a simmer again and add the greens. If using cabbage, the soup will need another 5 minutes' simmering. If using herbs or rocket, serve immediately. Garnish each bowlful with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Variations 1. Meat eaters can include bacon in the soup. It should be added to the pot with the onions and garlic. 2. If there is Parmesan or pecorino in the fridge, grate some and put it in a bowl on the table when you serve the soup. 3. Pancotto made with rocket is traditionally garnished with crushed dried chillies as well as with the extra-virgin olive oil. Escalivada - Spanish roast-vegetable salad This dish isn't sure if it's a salad or a stew, but it is lovely both as an accompaniment to meat or fish and as a dish on its own. If you can cook the vegetables on an open fire or barbecue, so much the better, as the flavour will be much improved. Otherwise, roast them in a hot oven. Serves 4-6. Kate Lewis 2 large baking potatoes 3 aubergines 3 red peppers 2 red onions extra-virgin olive oil 10 basil leaves, torn 2 courgettes, cut into 2cm pieces sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Pierce the skin of each potato and aubergine 3 or 4 times with a fork or sharp knife. Place all the vegetables except the courgettes on a baking sheet and roast on the top shelf of an oven preheated to 220 C/gas mark 7, until they are cooked through and the skins are evenly coloured (or roast them over a hot fire or barbecue). The peppers and aubergines will need 20-30 minutes and the potatoes and onions up to an hour. When the vegetables are cool enough to handle, peel them and roughly break them into large chunks. Dress the aubergines and potatoes generously with olive oil, salt, pepper and some of the torn basil and mix together in a serving dish. Season the courgettes and then fry them in olive oil until lightly coloured and tender. Lay them on top of the aubergine and potatoes with the peppers and onions. Season well, add the remaining basil and dress with more olive oil. Serve hot or at room temperature. Paella Valenciana Paella originated in Valencia and its name derives from paellera , the wide, shallow, two-handled pan in which it is cooked. Contrary to what most people think, it was originally made with meat, but these days shellfish is more popular. There are so many different theories about the right way to make paella that it's difficult to know which, if any, to accept. I will explain the main points here and leave the rest to your own interpretation. Traditionally, calasparra rice is used. This is difficult to find unless you know of a Spanish shop, but it is similar to the Italian arborio rice, which is stocked by most supermarkets. Like arborio, calasparra is a round-grain rice which takes longer to cook than long-grain rice, such as basmati. It absorbs liquid very slowly and then, when the grains have swelled, they release their starch all at once. Unlike a risotto, all the liquid is added to a paella in one go rather than in stages. You need a large flame, so if you don't have a big burner on your cooker, it is probably best done on a barbecue. Serves 4-6. Recipe by Carlos Vargas 2 \u00f1oras (Spanish sweet dried peppers, also known as romescos), or 1 red pepper, chopped 150ml olive oil 500g boneless chicken, cut into small pieces 100g boneless pork (leg or loin), cut into small pieces 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 small carrot, finely chopped 2 green peppers, chopped 150g fresh butter beans (or drained and rinsed tinned ones) 50g peas 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped 3 or 4 tomatoes, skinned and finely chopped 100g live snails (or use scrubbed cockles or clams if you can't get live, purged snails) 100g cooked ham, diced 500g calasparra or arborio rice 2 tbsp paprika a pinch of saffron strands 1 litre hot chicken stock juice of 1 lemon salt lemon wedges, to serve If using \u00f1oras, soak them in hot water for an hour, then drain and tear them into pieces. Heat the olive oil in a paellera at least 40cm in diameter. Add the chicken and pork and fry until browned all over, then remove from the pan with a slotted spoon. Stir in the onion, carrot, green peppers, butter beans, peas, garlic and \u00f1oras and cook until softened. Then add the tomatoes and wait until the juice runs, stirring several times. Add the snails (or cockles or clams) and ham. The heat will make the snails come out of their shells; at that moment, add the rice. Stir well, return the chicken and pork to the pan and add the paprika and about 2 tsp salt. Fry the mixture for 2 or 3 minutes so that the rice starts to catch, then add the saffron to the hot stock and pour it into the pan. When the paella starts to boil, add the lemon juice and turn the heat to low (the lemon prevents the rice becoming too sticky). It's best not to stir the paella now. Instead, move the pan occasionally so the heat is evenly distributed. When the rice is cooked (after about 15 minutes), cover with foil and leave to rest for 5 minutes. Adjust the seasoning if necessary, then serve with lemon wedges. Grilled tuna with salmoriglio and new potatoes Salmoriglio is a southern-Italian herb sauce that goes well with grilled fish and meat. It is strongly flavoured and should be treated with respect. Use the best olive oil you can afford. I have made it with oregano here, but you can also make a very flavourful thyme salmoriglio as long as you use young, green thyme that will crush to a paste easily. When buying the tuna, make sure you get fresh, not frozen, loin and ask the fishmonger to slice it for you rather than buying it ready sliced. Check that the fish doesn't look old and tired or grey, but has a shiny complexion. It can be quite dark or pale, depending on which part of the loin and what type of tuna it is. Recipe by Jake Hodges. 675g new potatoes such as Jersey Royals, or waxy potatoes, scrubbed clean a sprig of mint (optional) red-wine vinegar, olive oil and chopped herbs for dressing the potatoes (optional) 4 x 150g fresh tuna steaks, about 1.5cm thick salt and freshly ground black pepper for the salmoriglio cup of clean, well-dried oregano leaves 1 heaped tsp Maldon sea salt 2 tbsp lemon juice 6-8 tbsp good olive oil First make the salmoriglio: put the oregano leaves and salt in a pestle and mortar and crush to a smooth paste. Mix in the lemon juice, then gradually add enough olive oil to make an emulsion. Put the potatoes in a pan of cold water with some salt and the mint, if using, and bring to the boil. Simmer until tender, then drain well. If you like, toss the cooked potatoes with a few shakes of very fine red-wine vinegar and then with a little olive oil and whatever chopped herbs you fancy. I would probably use flat-leaf parsley and maybe a little mint, but there is no reason why you shouldn't use coriander, rocket or whatever else you have to hand.

      "body": "<p>If anything's certain today, it's that nothing's certain. It has always been this way for us human earth-dwellers, but until recently news travelled slowly. If you were going to cop it from a sabre-toothed tiger, you'd probably be the first and last to know. You wouldn't have been able to access a 'dangerous predator early-warning sign' by WAP. Nor would you have been any better forewarned of a plague or freak tidal wave, town-criers with bells ringing notwithstanding.</p> <p>These tumultuous days, however, not an iceberg can melt, nor a dietary staple show signs of running scarce or becoming contaminated without us being bombarded by early warnings, dire prognoses and processions of experts pontificating from a plethora of 24-hour news services.</p> <p>So, we've been warned - not just by anybody, mind you, but by the United Nations themselves, surely the closest we have to a global authority figure (no long-haired, sack-clothed prophets they, in other words). In the unlikely event that we mend our wicked ways, we must all prepare for increasing amounts of so-called freak weather - such as our own homegrown variety of flood as witnessed this very year on a grand scale, tidal flooding of vast tracts of inhabited land, including most of the world's major infrastructurally crucial metropolitan hubs, as well as drought, famine and unprecedented spreading of disease. They tell us euphemistically, in an attempt to be unalarmist, that this 'could' result in large-scale human death and suffering. And, to top it all, the markets are wobbling, mostly downwards, corruption is rife at the highest levels, social trends absurd and unpredictable, violence on the increase and substance abuse at an all-time high.</p> <p>Let's face it, the very structure of life as we know it is entirely up for grabs. Our world is falling apart, in other words, or at least undergoing radical transformation in a way that may well upset your morning breakfast. Indeed, daily breakfast is no longer guaranteed, nor even is the solid ground upon which to stand the kitchen table.</p> <p>And what do we do? Ignore it, of course. We go fully into collective denial and immerse ourselves in piffling details about which politician didn't manage to cover up a lie, which It-girl's marriage has just broken up or which bit of retro fashion has been rehashed yet again by the latest fly-by-night London designer. We become obsessed with the newest nutritional discovery or yoga style - especially if it's endorsed by one of the usual gaggle of mediocre celebrities.</p> <p>Of course we do. What other course of action is there? Running away isn't an option. Nor is trying to change the situation (it's too late). So we focus on the minutiae of our daily lives as if sticking to our agendas will grant immortality. And in the midst of all this potential mega-mayhem, you have characters like this columnist telling you that you have to learn to relax.</p> <p>Which is good advice at such uncertain times. After all, uncertainty fuels insecurity and insecurity fuels stress and no matter how well you hide it from yourself and others, this fundamental survival stress affects us all. Specifically, stress weakens your vital organs, which have to work twice as hard just to maintain equilibrium. This, in turn, leads to an increasing loss of stamina and, without stamina, every action, every thought even, presents a major challenge. Stamina is what enables you to keep going for the duration, no matter the challenge facing you - from running to the shops before they sell out of uncontaminated food to running away from a stray tsunami, if necessary.</p> <p>And while there are various herbal concoctions and mineral-vitamin melanges on the market offering the promise of stamina in a pill or cup of tea, the only way to access this invaluable resource is from deep within yourself. It begins with a positive thought (or affirmation), such as, 'I am imbued with infinite stamina, with infinite stamina I am imbued!' or something even less poetic. This institutes the right emotional conditions.</p> <p>Once this choice has been made, you must turn, as it were, to your body, and particularly to the front of your thighs - the quadriceps muscles, to be precise. For it is these the ancient Taoists discovered that, when properly exercised, imbue you with said infinite stamina. You may wish to experiment with me while you read, by standing now with feet shoulder-width apart as if standing in parallel skis, arches raised, knees lightly bent over your feet so as not to cave inwards towards each other and pelvis tilted slightly forward. Simultaneously feel as if the top of your head is suspended by an invisible thread to the ceiling. This has the effect of lengthening your spine. Hold this magazine (in both hands) up to to eye level with neck, shoulders and arms relaxed and rounded as if comfortably holding an invisible round pillar to your chest. As you read, gradually let your knees bend more and more deeply, until you look like you're sitting on a low bar-stool with spine vertical.</p> <p>By now, if you've managed to venture sufficiently groundwards, you will be feeling a pull in the thighs capable of making your entire body tremble like a horse.

      "bodyText": "If anything's certain today, it's that nothing's certain. It has always been this way for us human earth-dwellers, but until recently news travelled slowly. If you were going to cop it from a sabre-toothed tiger, you'd probably be the first and last to know. You wouldn't have been able to access a 'dangerous predator early-warning sign' by WAP. Nor would you have been any better forewarned of a plague or freak tidal wave, town-criers with bells ringing notwithstanding. These tumultuous days, however, not an iceberg can melt, nor a dietary staple show signs of running scarce or becoming contaminated without us being bombarded by early warnings, dire prognoses and processions of experts pontificating from a plethora of 24-hour news services. So, we've been warned - not just by anybody, mind you, but by the United Nations themselves, surely the closest we have to a global authority figure (no long-haired, sack-clothed prophets they, in other words). In the unlikely event that we mend our wicked ways, we must all prepare for increasing amounts of so-called freak weather - such as our own homegrown variety of flood as witnessed this very year on a grand scale, tidal flooding of vast tracts of inhabited land, including most of the world's major infrastructurally crucial metropolitan hubs, as well as drought, famine and unprecedented spreading of disease. They tell us euphemistically, in an attempt to be unalarmist, that this 'could' result in large-scale human death and suffering. And, to top it all, the markets are wobbling, mostly downwards, corruption is rife at the highest levels, social trends absurd and unpredictable, violence on the increase and substance abuse at an all-time high. Let's face it, the very structure of life as we know it is entirely up for grabs. Our world is falling apart, in other words, or at least undergoing radical transformation in a way that may well upset your morning breakfast. Indeed, daily breakfast is no longer guaranteed, nor even is the solid ground upon which to stand the kitchen table. And what do we do? Ignore it, of course. We go fully into collective denial and immerse ourselves in piffling details about which politician didn't manage to cover up a lie, which It-girl's marriage has just broken up or which bit of retro fashion has been rehashed yet again by the latest fly-by-night London designer. We become obsessed with the newest nutritional discovery or yoga style - especially if it's endorsed by one of the usual gaggle of mediocre celebrities. Of course we do. What other course of action is there? Running away isn't an option. Nor is trying to change the situation (it's too late). So we focus on the minutiae of our daily lives as if sticking to our agendas will grant immortality. And in the midst of all this potential mega-mayhem, you have characters like this columnist telling you that you have to learn to relax. Which is good advice at such uncertain times. After all, uncertainty fuels insecurity and insecurity fuels stress and no matter how well you hide it from yourself and others, this fundamental survival stress affects us all. Specifically, stress weakens your vital organs, which have to work twice as hard just to maintain equilibrium. This, in turn, leads to an increasing loss of stamina and, without stamina, every action, every thought even, presents a major challenge. Stamina is what enables you to keep going for the duration, no matter the challenge facing you - from running to the shops before they sell out of uncontaminated food to running away from a stray tsunami, if necessary. And while there are various herbal concoctions and mineral-vitamin melanges on the market offering the promise of stamina in a pill or cup of tea, the only way to access this invaluable resource is from deep within yourself. It begins with a positive thought (or affirmation), such as, 'I am imbued with infinite stamina, with infinite stamina I am imbued!' or something even less poetic. This institutes the right emotional conditions. Once this choice has been made, you must turn, as it were, to your body, and particularly to the front of your thighs - the quadriceps muscles, to be precise. For it is these the ancient Taoists discovered that, when properly exercised, imbue you with said infinite stamina. You may wish to experiment with me while you read, by standing now with feet shoulder-width apart as if standing in parallel skis, arches raised, knees lightly bent over your feet so as not to cave inwards towards each other and pelvis tilted slightly forward. Simultaneously feel as if the top of your head is suspended by an invisible thread to the ceiling. This has the effect of lengthening your spine. Hold this magazine (in both hands) up to to eye level with neck, shoulders and arms relaxed and rounded as if comfortably holding an invisible round pillar to your chest. As you read, gradually let your knees bend more and more deeply, until you look like you're sitting on a low bar-stool with spine vertical. By now, if you've managed to venture sufficiently groundwards, you will be feeling a pull in the thighs capable of making your entire body tremble like a horse. When this happens, keep breathing freely and simply drop even lower. Taoist masters (and mistresses) tend to practise this standing posture (without magazine) for approximately 10 full minutes twice a day, with some extreme standers breaking through the 60-minute mark. If continued daily, such practice will, even after only two or three days, increase available accessible stamina by a 'marketable' amount.

      "body": "<p>Even those with only the remotest interest in design will have noticed at least one design classic by Italian manufacturer Alessi over the years. In the 90s, the company put out a plastic menagerie of funky household accessories: nutcrackers in the shape of squirrels, whisks mimicking octopus tentacles, rabbit-shaped electronic timers, duck-like soap dispensers. Many of these waggish creatures, in their trademark boiled-sweet colours, had grinning faces, as if they were on Prozac or E. Hip, happy and youthful, they are, in retrospect, perfect icons of the rave generation. Alessi divides opinion down the middle: people see its creations as joyously witty or annoyingly jaunty. Take the second view, however, and you'd be dismissing a huge and influential chunk of Italian design history.</p> <p>Founded in 1921 by Giovanni Alessi, the company initially produced stolid, respectable coffee pots and trays in nickel, bronze and silver. Alessi's workshop was at Ormegna, beside Lake Orta, in the Italian Alps' Strona Valley; Alessi was one of a long line of metalwork manufacturers who'd settled there since the 18th century. But it was the next two generations of this family-run firm who would transform a business respected for its impressive workmanship to one admired for its innovative design. Taking up the reins in the late 30s, Giovanni's son Carlo, who created most of the company's designs between 1935 and 1945, had the foresight to realise stain- less steel was poised to become the metal du jour. His last confection, the 'Bombe' coffee and tea set, with its bulbous, almost Disney-esque forms, presaged the cartoony look that currently typifies Alessi's designs.</p> <p>Alberto Alessi, Carlo's eldest son and the company's managing director, can intellectualise about them until the cows come home. Alessi's duty is to create happiness, take risks, transcend functionalism and acknowledge that mass production can lead to dully homogeneous design. A romantic Socialist who joined the firm in 1970, he was determined to introduce such egalitarian, maverick concepts as art multiples. Carlo, however, took one look at a prototype for a multiple by Salvador Dali, and pulled the plug on the project.</p> <p>This didn't stop Alberto from insisting on the interdependence of art and design. He calls the Alessi workshops (based in nearby Crusinallo) an 'Italian design factory' and 'a research laboratory for applied arts'. Alessi is the natural heir, he says, to the Arts and Crafts movement initiated by John Ruskin and William Morris and kept alive by Bauhaus, the early 20th-century Vienna Workshops and the clean-linedScandinavian 50s designs of the likes of Alvar Aalto. 'Our products should be considered handicraft items made with the aid of machines,' he says with an unusually guttural Italian accent.</p> <p>High-falutin' stuff. But how can Alberto claim that Alessi's recent, apparently throwaway, synthetic designs belong to this tradition? 'A true work of design must move people, bring back memories, surprise, transgress, be poetic,' he says. In his eyes, it's important to recognise the symbolic, psychological and emotional impact of design. For him, design is as much about play as function.</p> <p>This fun-loving attitude has been embedded in Italian culture since the 60s: the decade's pop designers rejected functionalism for frivolous ornament, colour and form. Italian giant Ettore Sottsass designed a toy-like red typewriter for Olivetti; Donato D'Urbino, Paolo Lomazzi and Jonathan De Pas their inflatable armchair. US postmodern architect Robert Venturi - Alberto's all-time hero - championed 'hybrid elements rather than pure ones' in his 1965 anti-modernist book, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture .</p> <p>In the 70s, Alberto upped the company's profile by hiring such design titans as Achille Castiglione, Alessandro Mendini, Richard Sapper, Sottsass and Venturi. In the 80s, he employed Michael Graves - he of the oh-so-80s conical kettle with a bird for a whistle. Suddenly, Alessi's range of workaday kitchen utensils expanded to embrace ashtrays, clocks, watches and blenders (produced with Philips). Ironically, in the style-mad 80s, Alberto's democratic principles were betrayed by the acquisition of Alessi goods by status-symbol-craving yuppies. The Alessi ethos may value form as much as function, but this was going too far. Alberto admits the brand underwent a crisis, but prefers to call it 'a turning point'. 'I hope to have a crisis every 10 years, otherwise we wouldn't develop as I'd like. A central part of our identity is to move with society.'</p> <p>The amazing change of direction that improved the company's fortunes in the early 90s was down to the intuition of a young generation of international designers he employed, among them British-based Jasper Morrison, Marc Newson, Ron Arad, Sir Norman Foster and Francesca Amfitheatrof. 'My best marketing experts have always been my designers. They felt it was time to get into plastic. They were right: customers were yearning for joyful, playful design.'</p> <p>Out went the decade's harsh geometric shapes and monochrome surfaces. In came childlike, organic forms, like Philippe Starck's 'Juicy Salif' lemon squeezer, made for Alessi. Some of the new Alessi designs were shaped like cute animals, others were anthropomorphic, namely 'King-Kong Family' - stick-men and stick-women designed by Stefano Giovannoni and Guido Venturini.</p> <p>In Britain, these designs could be bought from department stores as well as chichi shops. Catherine Rogers, 29, and husband Andrew, 35, both interior designers, have been collecting Alessi pieces for five years. 'We love the funky designs,' says Catherine. 'We've got ashtrays, a biscuit container, three jars and green scales.' Lighting designer Tom Kirk, 28, bought his 'Spirale' ashtray, designed by Castiglione in 1970, in the Oggetti/Alessi shop on London's Fulham Road six years ago. 'I used to do silversmithing and prefer Alessi's metal pieces,' says Kirk. 'I'm not keen on the plastic stuff - all those dodgy squirrels.'</p> <p>It's fair to say that, by contrast to the exuberant, overtly humorous Italian designs in Alessi's 2,000-product catalogue, those of Morrison, Foster, Newson, Arad and Amfitheatrof show considerable restraint. Among Morrison's designs is a salad bowl with a subtle notch on its rim for your thumb to grip. Arad, a London-based Israeli, produced Soundtrack - a CD holder comprising a long, thin strip of thermoplastic resin with tiny indentations to slot in CDs. 'Italian design is not understated,' says Alberto. 'But Morrison's is, which I appreciate. He's the heir to classical English designers, whereas Arad creates genial ideas.' He says Arad's (non-Alessi) curving 'Bookworm' bookshelf 'reinvented the way you put books on shelves'. Australian-born Newson, who loves colourful, honed shapes, is influenced by Aboriginal culture, claims Alberto. He spotted the work of Amfitheatrof, a Royal College of Art silversmithing postgrad, at her final show: 'I was struck by her condom-holder. Silversmiths work on a microcosmic scale; they're introverts. But her piece convinced me shecould make the transition to product design, which is about designing for others.'</p> <p>What next for the ever-evolving Alessi brand? It's all down, it seems, to what his muses, the designers, decide is the next big thing. Creativity is a bottomless pit, according to Alberto. 'I firmly believe,' he declared recently with unabashed enthusiasm, 'that all the beautiful objects we have seen all these years are nothing compared to what we could do if only we learned to look at ourselves fearlessly, if we had the unswaying courage to face the white-hot, glowing core of the vastness of creative possibility.'</p> <p>\u0095 Alessi, 22 Brook Street, London W1 (020 7491 2428).</p>",

      "body": "<p>Next month will see the introduction of the new National Menu, which is part of the government's \u00a340m upgrade of hospital food. The scheme Better Patient Food, spearheaded by former Masterchef presenter Loyd Grossman, was announced last November and, if all goes to plan, a stay in hospital should guarantee a nutritious and varied menu. As far as my relatives are concerned, this is long overdue.</p> <p>When my husband Simon spent his first night in hospital awaiting an operation for a sports injury, he was served up 'a horrible, sloppy stew-like thing' which he recalls as being 'far worse than school dinners'. Bizarrely, he had played no part in the selection of this meal. It had been chosen for him by the patient who occupied the bed before him.</p> <p>This system was repeated on his last night when Simon, who was ready to be discharged, was asked to fill out the patient meal-request form for the next patient due in. My husband tried to choose considerately. He ticked the 'sandwich' option for the unwitting newcomer. 'These were bland but edible - not as good as the digestive biscuit served with tea in the morning, which was the best meal of the day - and better than the hot food.'</p> <p>Once it was established that the food was unpalatable, I starting bringing food from home. On one occasion my offerings were stolen. Simon suspects they were taken by a desperate patient whose morals had been weakened by a lack of nourishment. My husband's brief sojourn in hospital took place three years ago at the Middlesex Hospital in London - part of the well-respected University College London Hospitals (UCLH). Last week, my 64-year-old uncle was discharged from the same hospital and the words 'sloppy, soggy and disgusting' were once again deemed appropriate to describe the food.</p> <p>It seems nothing has changed - which belies the fact that, actually, much has gone on behind the scenes since my husband's discharge and my uncle's admission. For one thing, there was The Observer 's Dignity on the Ward Campaign. This focused specifically on the treatment of elderly patients in hospitals but also placed the spotlight on food, as many elderly patients were found to be poorly nourished while in hospital. This prompted Help the Aged to launch a two-year campaign, which ended officially at the start of February, and has gone a long way to put food on the Department of Health's agenda.</p> <p>Around the same time, a number of studies were published revealing the shocking truth about NHS food. One study in Dundee demonstrated that two-thirds of patients who have been hospitalised lose 5 per cent of their body weight by the time they are discharged.

In addition, my uncle couldn't even take solace, as my husband had done, in that English panacea - a nice cup of tea.

'It is not supposed to happen. Staff should fill out a late meal-request form.'

In 1996 my grandmother, then aged 89, was taken to Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield (now part of Barnet and Chase Farm NHS Trust) for a hip replacement. After surgery she was disorientated and in no position to communicate her food needs. So, at 5.45pm each evening, when an orderly dumped a ham sandwich in front of her, it remained untouched. Some 45 minutes later, the orderly would remove the unopened sandwich without a word. This process continued each day. My grandmother is an Orthodox Jew.

Eirlys Evans, clinical manager for medicine and care of the elderly at the trust, sounded appalled by my grandmother's treatment.

      "bodyText": "Next month will see the introduction of the new National Menu, which is part of the government's \u00a340m upgrade of hospital food. The scheme Better Patient Food, spearheaded by former Masterchef presenter Loyd Grossman, was announced last November and, if all goes to plan, a stay in hospital should guarantee a nutritious and varied menu. As far as my relatives are concerned, this is long overdue. When my husband Simon spent his first night in hospital awaiting an operation for a sports injury, he was served up 'a horrible, sloppy stew-like thing' which he recalls as being 'far worse than school dinners'. Bizarrely, he had played no part in the selection of this meal. It had been chosen for him by the patient who occupied the bed before him. This system was repeated on his last night when Simon, who was ready to be discharged, was asked to fill out the patient meal-request form for the next patient due in. My husband tried to choose considerately. He ticked the 'sandwich' option for the unwitting newcomer. 'These were bland but edible - not as good as the digestive biscuit served with tea in the morning, which was the best meal of the day - and better than the hot food.' Once it was established that the food was unpalatable, I starting bringing food from home. On one occasion my offerings were stolen. Simon suspects they were taken by a desperate patient whose morals had been weakened by a lack of nourishment. My husband's brief sojourn in hospital took place three years ago at the Middlesex Hospital in London - part of the well-respected University College London Hospitals (UCLH). Last week, my 64-year-old uncle was discharged from the same hospital and the words 'sloppy, soggy and disgusting' were once again deemed appropriate to describe the food. It seems nothing has changed - which belies the fact that, actually, much has gone on behind the scenes since my husband's discharge and my uncle's admission. For one thing, there was The Observer 's Dignity on the Ward Campaign. This focused specifically on the treatment of elderly patients in hospitals but also placed the spotlight on food, as many elderly patients were found to be poorly nourished while in hospital. This prompted Help the Aged to launch a two-year campaign, which ended officially at the start of February, and has gone a long way to put food on the Department of Health's agenda. Around the same time, a number of studies were published revealing the shocking truth about NHS food. One study in Dundee demonstrated that two-thirds of patients who have been hospitalised lose 5 per cent of their body weight by the time they are discharged. When my uncle left hospital, he had lost 2st. A further study found that malnutrition runs at 11 per cent among patients who have had major surgery, 10 per cent in cancer patients and 10 per cent in those with chronic disease of the lung, gastrointestinal tract or nervous system. Furthermore, according to a report from the British Association for Perenteral and Enteral Nutrition (a body of health professionals which runs the Malnutrition Advisory Group), up to 40 per cent of adult patients who are admitted to hospital are already malnourished on entry.

      "body": "<p>Union officials stalk the corridors of ad agencies, MSF starts a recruitment drive among Britain's 3,500 methodist ministers, and the TUC launches a consultancy to help employers get on better with unions. </p> <p>Could that much-touted - but rarely seen in practice - concept of the third way be alive and well, and living in the realm of industrial relations? </p> <p> Since the Employment Relations Act reached the statute book last July, trade unions have been thrown into a frenzy of activity. Here was a whole raft of new rights passed into law, including the right to union recognition where a majority of the workforce wants it, new rights for part-time workers, the right to be accompanied by a union rep or colleague at a disciplinary hearing, and protection from unfair dismissal for workers who have been employed for one year. Eight months on there is a great deal of evidence that the legislation has precipitated a change in culture, despite what is seen in some quarters as its considerable shortcomings. </p> <p>First the good news. Last month MSF - the former manufacturing, science and finance union - union celebrated victory in the first ever compulsory union recognition ballot under the new Act. Staff at Saudi Arabian Airways voted by 9-1 for MSF to negotiate pay and conditions on their behalf. The ballot was ordered by the Central Arbitration Committee, the government body set up to deal with recognition claims. The company, which had until then refused to have any dealings with the union, will now have to collectively bargain with MSF. </p> <p>But the airline's opposition goes against a trend towards more favourable relationships between unions and employers. MSF already has agreements with many airlines, including BA, Lufthansa and KLM. It also recently signed a voluntary recognition deal with computer services giant CSC, covering 7,000 people. </p> <p>The TUC's recently published annual survey, 'Focus on union recognition' shows that unions have won 159 new deals in a year - double the number reported in 1999. The new deals - mostly in the private sector - cover more than 58,000 workers, from airline staff to employees of internet banks. In over half of these agreements (51 per cent), according to TUC statistics, unions say the new right to recognition was influential in securing a deal. Several say that being able to report employers to the Central Arbitration Committee had also resulted in a positive response from employers. </p> <p>As the TUC pushes the concept of partnership and encourages unions to do the same, the consensus is that it is voluntary agreements are easier to enforce and create more productive workplaces. Launching the TUC Partnership Institute - which is trying to break the 'them and us' mould, initially through five pilot projects involving unions and employers, including University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust and Barclays Bank - TUC general secretary John Monks said: 'Elsewhere in Europe, unions tend to have better working relationships with employers. It's no accident that as a result those countries are more productive. Now the TUC will help UK companies close the gap.' </p> <p>According to Brian Towers, professor of industrial relations at Nottingham Trent University, there is plenty of evidence that companies that are unionised are more successful. But he also stresses the importance of unions working towards voluntary, rather than compulsory, agreements. As the law stands, unions which have majority support in a workplace will be able to claim union recognition. Majority support means either demonstrating there are 50 per cent plus one members in a workforce or winning a yes vote from 40 per cent of the workforce in a ballot. </p> <p> 'Unions need to devote as much energy as possible to securing voluntary agreements,' says Towers. 'Enforced recognition holds risks for all sides. For employers and employees, workplace relationships are likely to become strained. For unions, losing a few high-profile ballots could damage their reputation and the perception of union recognition as a whole.' The other reason why compulsory agreements are not the unions' first choice is the fact that employers can apply for another ballot after two years. The UK legislation follows a US model, rather than that followed in European countries, and in the US the two-year rule has been used to try to undermine the union by offering a combination of financial incentives and coercion to attempt to reverse the original vote and derecognise the union. </p> <p>The North American model of union recognition has never been to the liking of the Institute of Employment Rights. Its director, Carolyn Jones, says: 'Before the legislation came into effect we reviewed what already existed in countries such as Italy, Germany, France and Sweden.

      "bodyText": "Union officials stalk the corridors of ad agencies, MSF starts a recruitment drive among Britain's 3,500 methodist ministers, and the TUC launches a consultancy to help employers get on better with unions. Could that much-touted - but rarely seen in practice - concept of the third way be alive and well, and living in the realm of industrial relations? Since the Employment Relations Act reached the statute book last July, trade unions have been thrown into a frenzy of activity. Here was a whole raft of new rights passed into law, including the right to union recognition where a majority of the workforce wants it, new rights for part-time workers, the right to be accompanied by a union rep or colleague at a disciplinary hearing, and protection from unfair dismissal for workers who have been employed for one year. Eight months on there is a great deal of evidence that the legislation has precipitated a change in culture, despite what is seen in some quarters as its considerable shortcomings. First the good news. Last month MSF - the former manufacturing, science and finance union - union celebrated victory in the first ever compulsory union recognition ballot under the new Act. Staff at Saudi Arabian Airways voted by 9-1 for MSF to negotiate pay and conditions on their behalf. The ballot was ordered by the Central Arbitration Committee, the government body set up to deal with recognition claims. The company, which had until then refused to have any dealings with the union, will now have to collectively bargain with MSF. But the airline's opposition goes against a trend towards more favourable relationships between unions and employers. MSF already has agreements with many airlines, including BA, Lufthansa and KLM. It also recently signed a voluntary recognition deal with computer services giant CSC, covering 7,000 people. The TUC's recently published annual survey, 'Focus on union recognition' shows that unions have won 159 new deals in a year - double the number reported in 1999. The new deals - mostly in the private sector - cover more than 58,000 workers, from airline staff to employees of internet banks. In over half of these agreements (51 per cent), according to TUC statistics, unions say the new right to recognition was influential in securing a deal. Several say that being able to report employers to the Central Arbitration Committee had also resulted in a positive response from employers. As the TUC pushes the concept of partnership and encourages unions to do the same, the consensus is that it is voluntary agreements are easier to enforce and create more productive workplaces. Launching the TUC Partnership Institute - which is trying to break the 'them and us' mould, initially through five pilot projects involving unions and employers, including University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust and Barclays Bank - TUC general secretary John Monks said: 'Elsewhere in Europe, unions tend to have better working relationships with employers. It's no accident that as a result those countries are more productive. Now the TUC will help UK companies close the gap.' According to Brian Towers, professor of industrial relations at Nottingham Trent University, there is plenty of evidence that companies that are unionised are more successful. But he also stresses the importance of unions working towards voluntary, rather than compulsory, agreements. As the law stands, unions which have majority support in a workplace will be able to claim union recognition. Majority support means either demonstrating there are 50 per cent plus one members in a workforce or winning a yes vote from 40 per cent of the workforce in a ballot. 'Unions need to devote as much energy as possible to securing voluntary agreements,' says Towers. 'Enforced recognition holds risks for all sides. For employers and employees, workplace relationships are likely to become strained. For unions, losing a few high-profile ballots could damage their reputation and the perception of union recognition as a whole.' The other reason why compulsory agreements are not the unions' first choice is the fact that employers can apply for another ballot after two years. The UK legislation follows a US model, rather than that followed in European countries, and in the US the two-year rule has been used to try to undermine the union by offering a combination of financial incentives and coercion to attempt to reverse the original vote and derecognise the union. The North American model of union recognition has never been to the liking of the Institute of Employment Rights. Its director, Carolyn Jones, says: 'Before the legislation came into effect we reviewed what already existed in countries such as Italy, Germany, France and Sweden. We found that the North American model the British government opted for was the least productive. It puts the unions through too many hurdles and a lot of expense for what should be a basic human right - being represented by a union.' Although Jones admits that the Act has led to a change in culture and that unions have been successful in winning more voluntary agreements, she, along with the TUC and others, is concerned at what, and who, the legislation leaves out. In particular there is the exemption of companies which employ fewer than 21 people. 'This means that there are 5 million workers who cannot be represented by a union. Nine out of 10 companies in this country have fewer than 21 employees. This is one hurdle too far,' says Jones. There is also concern within the TUC that companies intent on keeping unions out will organise themselves into smaller units. Meanwhile, on the ground, Muff Sourani, regional officer for MSF in the West Midlands, has found that in its attempt to be neutral, the law leaves too much opportunity for companies to hold up proceedings, even where there is a cut and dried case and the majority of the workforce are union members. 'I have handled two cases of union recognition and have found that the legislation does not serve us well. There are too many escape routes for employers and too many opportunities for them to manipulate negotiations.' One of the companies Sourani was involved with succeeded in stalling the negotiations for a voluntary agreement long enough to announce the closure of its West Midlands factory and the transfer of its business to France. But the legislation has also allowed a back door route into companies reluctant to unionise and into industries that traditionally have never been unionised. Michael Burd of solicitor Lewis Silkin says: 'Other legal developments, such as the right to be represented by a union official in disciplinary and grievance procedures, have given the unions the chance to show workers what they can do. Under the statute there doesn't have to be recognition of a union, and you don't have to be a union member to have a representative.

Then suddenly some are confronted with a trade union representative at a grievance meeting. It's a very useful way for a union to get its name about.'",

      "body": "<p>A pigeon has just dive-bombed Paul Smith's shoulder. We were merrily enjoying a quick lunch of panini and pasta, and there it was. Splat! A big white stain on the British designer's immaculate, navy, silk-lined with purple, Paul Smith suit jacket. For most fashion people, this would be the trigger that snaps a very taut spring. Imagine Giorgio Armani's face if such a thing happened to him. He would be swarmed by PRs and assistants. The offending pigeon would be shot down on sight. The jacket would be ceremoniously removed for some serious cleaning and a new jacket would be found. Pronto. </p> <p>And then everybody would act as though nothing had happened. But this is no ordinary fashion designer. It's Sir Paul Smith, the Nottingham lad made good. As soon as he notices, his face lights up. He's delighted. 'It's good luck for the new shop!' he declares, attempting to mop it off with a handkerchief. And then to our photographer for the day: 'Look! Take a picture of this!' </p> <p>While his story is a familiar one, it is also unique in the British fashion industry. Milan has Donatella Versace, Giorgio Armani, Tom Ford, Alberta Ferretti, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Miuccia Prada, and numerous other highly successful designers who have built up their own companies, but Britain has Smith. Sure there's Betty Jackson, Katharine Hamnett, and John Rocha, who all turn over healthy businesses. And there's Alexander McQueen who has sold a 51 per cent stake in his company to Gucci. But in terms of a solid, established, independent brand that is known from Taipei to Toronto, Smith is the only one. He's our equivalent, albeit on a much smaller scale, of Ralph Lauren, or Mr Armani, who has also remained independent. 'It's so difficult to talk about yourself without sounding big headed, but I just think we've got it right,' he says. </p> <p>And now he's moved into the very heart of fashion's golden triangle, where flagships for Armani, Versace, Gucci and Dolce &amp; Gabbana all jostle for space. Milan is a serious business. And Smith's first Italian shop (there are 10 in the UK, one in Paris, one in New York and 200 in Japan) is on Via Manzoni, right opposite the super-slick, ultra-minimal Giorgio Armani department store which opened last year, and positively vibrates with fluorescent light. </p> <p>It is the day before the opening and there is still white paper covering the door. But the window display is finished. It couldn't be more low-tech if it tried. There are no clothes in the window - no product whatsoever. Instead, there is a mound of screwed up pages from the Financial Times . That's it. Crinkly balls of pink newspaper. While passers-by seem oblivious to the bright white glow of Armani's windows, they stop in their tracks at the sight of Smith's. They do a double take. Children stand and point. People look a little confused. Some look amused. And others, when they catch sight of Paul Smith, grinning widely and waving at them from inside the shop, really don't know what to think. Some wave back. Others look vaguely embarrassed and walk away. </p> <p>'It's not necessary to have clothes in the window,' says Smith. 'It's obvious it's a clothes shop. We're just trying not to take the obvious route all the time. We can do anything we want to do. Sometimes we don't have anything in the window. Sometimes it might be just a frog. Look! Everybody's stopping!' And it's true. The lunchtime shoppers of Milan are thoroughly enjoying Smith's first little window joke. And he is loving every minute of it. </p> <p>So why the FT ? Is this Paul Smith's little joke about big business, money and fashion? Before Christmas, there were rumours that the designer was the next to join the massive LVMH luxury goods conglomerate - along with an ever increasing list of design houses and brand names, including Givenchy, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Celine, and Pucci. In November, the New York Post reported that LVMH was chasing a 25 per cent stake in the privately owned company, which is estimated to be worth \u00a3220m. Business in Japan alone, is worth \u00a3150m. In September, LVMH's arch-rival, Gucci Group was reported to be hot on the trail. So, too, were Richemont, the Swiss group which owns Chlo\u00e9, and the Italian jewellery house, Bulgari. According to Smith, there were so many parties interested in investing in his company, negotiations had become a full time job. </p> <p>He employed the services of merchant bankers, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. It was time to do some hard thinking. 'I think I'm my own worst enemy commercially, because everything I stand for is the opposite to what it's supposed to be in business,' he says. His life is comfortable and happy, shared with his wife, Pauline (they married last year, after being together over 30 years) and her son, Jason, who is involved in the business in charge of export sales. </p> <p>'Pauline and I are not motivated by getting more and more money. We have made some money over the years but it was never a plan.' They have a house in Notting Hill Gate, complete with a studio where Pauline can paint, and holiday homes in Tuscany and Sardinia. Paul's car collection stretches to a Mini in Sardinia, a Toyota Land Cruiser in Tuscany, and an old BMW and a Bristol in London. He lusts after quirky Morris Minor vans rather than Ferraris. </p> <p>By accepting a \u00a330m investment in the company, however, Paul could put his feet up, and Pauline, who is no longer involved in the business, could paint to her heart's content. But Paul is hyperactive. He has more energy in his little finger than many people have in their whole bodies. And he actually enjoys what he does so much that, in a funny kind of way, his life is one long holiday - even though he never seems to stop working. 'I am just absolutely, totally, genuinely enthusiastic about what I do for a living,' he says. And you have to believe him. 'I don't need the money anyway. If I suddenly got x number of millions tomorrow, it wouldn't change my lifestyle. You know, I'm still in love with Pauline after 33 years; we've paid for our houses; we're not into yachts or whatever; anybody can have a car these days - you don't have to be rich. So I don't see what it can bring you more than what you've got.' </p> <p>So it seems, Paul Smith is not for sale. 'We had all the proposed deals - we were talking about millions and millions of quid - but we rejected them, in preference for staying independent for the time being.' And he's really enjoying his state of independence, on a bit of a one-man crusade about the globalisation of fashion. </p> <p>'I'm not saying the large brands are not creative. But sadly they are over-distributed and over-produced. Where it used to be about individuality, it's actually more about well designed, well-made clothes that are available in every corner of the earth, which to me is terribly sad, because you used to spend your hard-earned money on a bit of designer clothing, because you wanted to have the individuality that came from the designers head and heart. Now it's all about brands.' </p> <p>A shop in central Milan does not come cheap. 'Key money' paid to the landlord can be in the region of \u00a31m. And then there's the rent on top. But the Italian customer has been a good, loyal one for Smith, and he is confident that, despite the fact that it's like 'bringing coals to Newcastle', the move will pay off. The shop, designed by Sophie Hicks, who created Smith's flagship shop-within-a-house Westbourne House store, is plastered in a sugary shade of peachy pink throughout - a twist on the traditional siena red of Tuscany. 'We wanted a vulgar pink,' says Hicks. 'It's as shocking a pink as the plaster will take.' She has just completed two more shops for Smith in Tokyo. One, specialising in his Red Ear denim range, will be decorated with hundreds of hunting trophies. The idea is that the jeans will hang from antlers rather than hangers. </p> <p>The new shop is unlike anything Milan has to offer. But then that's not hard. The city has honed down shop fitting to its most basic show and sell. At Paul Smith, there are clothes and handbags (lots of vintage ones mixed with the new). There are sunglasses and shoes. But there is also a really eclectic mix of books (from a 70s publication called Disco by Albert Goldman to Flower Decoration by Constance Spry and the entire collection of books by Cecil Beaton), bits of china, toys, and photographic prints by society photographer Slim Aarons, whose 1950s pictures of the jet set hanging out in Palm Springs and St Tropez inspired this season's collection for both men and women. It is the extra 'stuff' that makes the customer return. 'It goes back to my original little shop in Nottingham,' explains Smith, 'when Pauline and I used to go on holiday to Greece, and I'd buy six pen knives or four pencils from an old utilitarian shop, or some old school exercise books and actually offer them for sale.' </p> <p>Smith has a bit of a problem with 'stuff'. He just can't resist buying it. And usually in bulk. He's been known to buy entire shops. 'I bought 350 robots in one go,' he confesses. 'There was a stall in Paris selling badges, and I bought the entire stall.' On holiday recently, a shop full of crockery caught his eye, but he realised it would have taken a few days to sort out and he was on holiday after all, so he resisted. 'You should see my room at home,' he says, before reeling off a list: 'five massive piles of magazines; two doll's houses; a fantastic old trunk; model churches; 16 train sets; 400 books; 18 paintings_ masses of stuff.' </p> <p>A photographer recently used Smith's office, in the attic above his Covent Garden shop, as part of an ongoing project. The idea was to photograph the office as if it were a beach. Every time the post arrived, the shore line would build up a little bit more, with gifts, souvenirs, postcards, letters, and toy rabbits (he says rabbits bring him luck, so his Japanese fans send him about 20 a week). </p> <p>'I'll collect, say, doll's houses for four years and then they'll just build up, and then I'll sell the whole lot.' Like the Cecil Beaton books in the Milan shop. He has his own collection as well. These are just duplicates. But he says he's not a collector, and knows little about the stuff he buys. He just likes to accumulate things en mass. And then he likes to sell them again. The office and his room at home are just the tip of the iceberg. In his hometown of Nottingham, where the company still has its headquarters, he has 'Paul's Room', which is actually one of a series of warehouses. It has recently been archived, all 80 to 100 cartons. </p> <p>Before Christmas, Robert Violette published a tiny book of photographs taken by the designer and his father, who was a Nottingham draper. It came about because the publisher is working on a bigger book (a collection of Paul's observations and ideas) to be published next autumn. While rummaging through the archives, Violette found a box full of Smith's dad's prints. He was quite the amateur photographer, but while his father's pictures are carefully composed, Paul's snaps appear to have no thought behind them at all. He literally points and shoots. Anything and everything. He prides himself on taking his camera with him wherever he goes, and he snaps with the same hunger as he buys things. If he can't buy it, he'll photograph it. And while he can't necessarily sell the print, he can use it as pattern on a T-shirt or for a shirt or dress. </p> <p>Smith says he doesn't know where his buying and selling bug came from. As a boy, his passion was for cycling, but an accident put an end to any ideas he might have had of pursuing it as a career. Instead, at the age of 18, his father introduced him to the rag trade. He found him a job as a runner in a local clothing warehouse. Paul discovered the world of fashion at its most unglamorous, but was hooked. Two years on, in 1970, he set up shop. The little boutique only opened on Fridays and Saturdays and sold hard-to-get button-fly Levi's, Anello and Davide boots, carpenters' bags from New York, and matching jeans with a loop for the hammer. He was spurred on by his girlfriend, an RCA fashion graduate called Pauline Denyer, who he'd met at his local pub in 1968. </p> <p>'Without realising it,' he recalls. 'I was working out how to make my shop more special than anybody else's -you can't compete with just the clothes, because there are people far more organised, more established and more powerful than you. So how do you do it? You do it with personality, individuality and also with things you can't normally get. The shop manager was an Afghan hound because Homer, Pauline's dog, ran the shop. You walked into this 12ftsq shop and there was this giant Afghan hound, and a guy called Paul who looked like an Afghan hound - tall and thin, big nose and very long hair. Everybody said hello to Homer before they did me. So, you know, that was an immediate interesting starting point.' </p> <p>Pauline helped her boyfriend with his design work, before going back to school to pursue her interest in painting. He went to night school, too, and was taught by a military tailor. By 1976, he was ready to show his menswear on the catwalks of Paris and his signature 'classic-with-a-twist' style was born. In 1979, Smith moved his shop to the capital, and opened up in Covent Garden. His was the first business in Floral Street, where the warehouses were still being used to store bananas. It was a shrewd move. As the area has developed (there is now an M&amp;S round the corner, as well as a couple of Gaps, a Pret A Manger, Nicole Farhi and French Connection), so has his business. </p> <p>Despite his success, he feels he has only recently been taken seriously as a designer in the UK. 'It's so hard to get taken seriously as a fashion designer, because the establishment in Britain thinks you're weird. I think in my case, now, and especially after having the old tap on the shoulder, I think yes I am taken seriously because we've won the Queen's award for export, and we employ a lot of people.' </p> <p>Still, he's frustrated that his womenswear shows, which have been presented on the London catwalks for the past seven seasons, notch up only the odd mention in the papers. 'How many people do you see walking round with chrome conical bras on? How many people do you see sitting in restaurants with bare breasts? What I do is what people want, which is why at British Fashion Week last time I got no press at all - none! But my sales went up 52 per cent. I don't need the headlines. There's no point. I find it disappointing, that's all. If I was showing in Italy, I'd be in the papers because they respect fashion as an industry, as an earner of wages, a creator of jobs, a supporter of families, as a creator of taxes. You would show a simple navy blue suit and it would still be in the papers.' Needless to say, he is contemplating moving his catwalk shows to the Italian fashion capital. </p> <p>The knighthood, last November, came as a surprise to Smith, who had already received a CBE in 1994. It also happened on the day that he and Pauline had arranged to finally get married, a simple registry office job, and then off to a party with friends at the Tate Modern. Typically, Smith, who above all else, is an incorrigible salesman, managed to sell something to one of the ushers during the ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He had forgotten his wife's birthday, and Smith wrote him a note to give to the shop manager: 'I've met this guy at Buck House (honest!). He's a nice bloke and he's forgotten his wife's birthday - give him 20 per cent off.' Another happy customer. </p> <p>'I'm not sure about having the knighthood,' he says 'It's just in a drawer at home.' He is not really an awards person. He has consistently snubbed the British Fashion Awards. 'It's not right to have an awards ceremony when you haven't got an industry. It's not on - it's just for the wrong reasons. Often, the designer of the year has been on the verge of bankruptcy. I just don't think it's right.' This year, he won the prize for Classic Design, but he didn't attend. His friend, GQ editor Dylan Jones picked up the award on his behalf. While his menswear is still a hit with fashion editors, as well as his customers, his womenswear doesn't set the pulse racing; he has never been a contender for the designer of the year prize. He just isn't 'fashion' enough. </p> <p>'He's very unspoilt,' says Sophie Hicks. 'Most people who've reached that point would be quite tricky and full of themselves. He's just very natural. Always straightforward. There's no hidden agenda.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Italians and the Swiss and the French are still knocking on Smith's door. The Milan shop, with its bold style and unique stock, will only add to their determination. In the long term, Smith might have no option but to sell a percentage. 'The massive dilemma is what happens after Paul Smith,' he says. </p> <p>It's a problem he shares with Giorgio Armani opposite. 'I am 54 years of age. You don't go on forever.' Everything about the brand is so closely tied up with the personality of the man, an investor would worry about what would happen to Paul Smith the brand without Paul Smith the man. As he says, commercially he's his own worst enemy. But then, he really wouldn't have it any other way.</p>",

People look a little confused. Some look amused. And others, when they catch sight of Paul Smith, grinning widely and waving at them from inside the shop, really don't know what to think. Some wave back. Others look vaguely embarrassed and walk away. 'It's not necessary to have clothes in the window,' says Smith. 'It's obvious it's a clothes shop. We're just trying not to take the obvious route all the time. We can do anything we want to do. Sometimes we don't have anything in the window. Sometimes it might be just a frog. Look! Everybody's stopping!' And it's true. The lunchtime shoppers of Milan are thoroughly enjoying Smith's first little window joke. And he is loving every minute of it. So why the FT ? Is this Paul Smith's little joke about big business, money and fashion? Before Christmas, there were rumours that the designer was the next to join the massive LVMH luxury goods conglomerate - along with an ever increasing list of design houses and brand names, including Givenchy, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Celine, and Pucci. In November, the New York Post reported that LVMH was chasing a 25 per cent stake in the privately owned company, which is estimated to be worth \u00a3220m. Business in Japan alone, is worth \u00a3150m. In September, LVMH's arch-rival, Gucci Group was reported to be hot on the trail. So, too, were Richemont, the Swiss group which owns Chlo\u00e9, and the Italian jewellery house, Bulgari. According to Smith, there were so many parties interested in investing in his company, negotiations had become a full time job. He employed the services of merchant bankers, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. It was time to do some hard thinking. 'I think I'm my own worst enemy commercially, because everything I stand for is the opposite to what it's supposed to be in business,' he says. His life is comfortable and happy, shared with his wife, Pauline (they married last year, after being together over 30 years) and her son, Jason, who is involved in the business in charge of export sales. 'Pauline and I are not motivated by getting more and more money. We have made some money over the years but it was never a plan.' They have a house in Notting Hill Gate, complete with a studio where Pauline can paint, and holiday homes in Tuscany and Sardinia. Paul's car collection stretches to a Mini in Sardinia, a Toyota Land Cruiser in Tuscany, and an old BMW and a Bristol in London. He lusts after quirky Morris Minor vans rather than Ferraris. By accepting a \u00a330m investment in the company, however, Paul could put his feet up, and Pauline, who is no longer involved in the business, could paint to her heart's content. But Paul is hyperactive. He has more energy in his little finger than many people have in their whole bodies. And he actually enjoys what he does so much that, in a funny kind of way, his life is one long holiday - even though he never seems to stop working. 'I am just absolutely, totally, genuinely enthusiastic about what I do for a living,' he says. And you have to believe him. 'I don't need the money anyway. If I suddenly got x number of millions tomorrow, it wouldn't change my lifestyle. You know, I'm still in love with Pauline after 33 years; we've paid for our houses; we're not into yachts or whatever; anybody can have a car these days - you don't have to be rich. So I don't see what it can bring you more than what you've got.' So it seems, Paul Smith is not for sale. 'We had all the proposed deals - we were talking about millions and millions of quid - but we rejected them, in preference for staying independent for the time being.' And he's really enjoying his state of independence, on a bit of a one-man crusade about the globalisation of fashion. 'I'm not saying the large brands are not creative. But sadly they are over-distributed and over-produced. Where it used to be about individuality, it's actually more about well designed, well-made clothes that are available in every corner of the earth, which to me is terribly sad, because you used to spend your hard-earned money on a bit of designer clothing, because you wanted to have the individuality that came from the designers head and heart. Now it's all about brands.' A shop in central Milan does not come cheap. 'Key money' paid to the landlord can be in the region of \u00a31m. And then there's the rent on top. But the Italian customer has been a good, loyal one for Smith, and he is confident that, despite the fact that it's like 'bringing coals to Newcastle', the move will pay off. The shop, designed by Sophie Hicks, who created Smith's flagship shop-within-a-house Westbourne House store, is plastered in a sugary shade of peachy pink throughout - a twist on the traditional siena red of Tuscany. 'We wanted a vulgar pink,' says Hicks. 'It's as shocking a pink as the plaster will take.' She has just completed two more shops for Smith in Tokyo. One, specialising in his Red Ear denim range, will be decorated with hundreds of hunting trophies. The idea is that the jeans will hang from antlers rather than hangers. The new shop is unlike anything Milan has to offer. But then that's not hard. The city has honed down shop fitting to its most basic show and sell. At Paul Smith, there are clothes and handbags (lots of vintage ones mixed with the new). There are sunglasses and shoes. But there is also a really eclectic mix of books (from a 70s publication called Disco by Albert Goldman to Flower Decoration by Constance Spry and the entire collection of books by Cecil Beaton), bits of china, toys, and photographic prints by society photographer Slim Aarons, whose 1950s pictures of the jet set hanging out in Palm Springs and St Tropez inspired this season's collection for both men and women. It is the extra 'stuff' that makes the customer return. 'It goes back to my original little shop in Nottingham,' explains Smith, 'when Pauline and I used to go on holiday to Greece, and I'd buy six pen knives or four pencils from an old utilitarian shop, or some old school exercise books and actually offer them for sale.' Smith has a bit of a problem with 'stuff'. He just can't resist buying it. And usually in bulk. He's been known to buy entire shops. 'I bought 350 robots in one go,' he confesses. 'There was a stall in Paris selling badges, and I bought the entire stall.' On holiday recently, a shop full of crockery caught his eye, but he realised it would have taken a few days to sort out and he was on holiday after all, so he resisted. 'You should see my room at home,' he says, before reeling off a list: 'five massive piles of magazines; two doll's houses; a fantastic old trunk; model churches; 16 train sets; 400 books; 18 paintings_ masses of stuff.' A photographer recently used Smith's office, in the attic above his Covent Garden shop, as part of an ongoing project. The idea was to photograph the office as if it were a beach. Every time the post arrived, the shore line would build up a little bit more, with gifts, souvenirs, postcards, letters, and toy rabbits (he says rabbits bring him luck, so his Japanese fans send him about 20 a week). 'I'll collect, say, doll's houses for four years and then they'll just build up, and then I'll sell the whole lot.' Like the Cecil Beaton books in the Milan shop. He has his own collection as well. These are just duplicates. But he says he's not a collector, and knows little about the stuff he buys. He just likes to accumulate things en mass. And then he likes to sell them again. The office and his room at home are just the tip of the iceberg. In his hometown of Nottingham, where the company still has its headquarters, he has 'Paul's Room', which is actually one of a series of warehouses. It has recently been archived, all 80 to 100 cartons. Before Christmas, Robert Violette published a tiny book of photographs taken by the designer and his father, who was a Nottingham draper. It came about because the publisher is working on a bigger book (a collection of Paul's observations and ideas) to be published next autumn. While rummaging through the archives, Violette found a box full of Smith's dad's prints. He was quite the amateur photographer, but while his father's pictures are carefully composed, Paul's snaps appear to have no thought behind them at all. He literally points and shoots. Anything and everything. He prides himself on taking his camera with him wherever he goes, and he snaps with the same hunger as he buys things. If he can't buy it, he'll photograph it. And while he can't necessarily sell the print, he can use it as pattern on a T-shirt or for a shirt or dress. Smith says he doesn't know where his buying and selling bug came from. As a boy, his passion was for cycling, but an accident put an end to any ideas he might have had of pursuing it as a career. Instead, at the age of 18, his father introduced him to the rag trade. He found him a job as a runner in a local clothing warehouse. Paul discovered the world of fashion at its most unglamorous, but was hooked. Two years on, in 1970, he set up shop. The little boutique only opened on Fridays and Saturdays and sold hard-to-get button-fly Levi's, Anello and Davide boots, carpenters' bags from New York, and matching jeans with a loop for the hammer. He was spurred on by his girlfriend, an RCA fashion graduate called Pauline Denyer, who he'd met at his local pub in 1968. 'Without realising it,' he recalls. 'I was working out how to make my shop more special than anybody else's -you can't compete with just the clothes, because there are people far more organised, more established and more powerful than you. So how do you do it? You do it with personality, individuality and also with things you can't normally get. The shop manager was an Afghan hound because Homer, Pauline's dog, ran the shop. You walked into this 12ftsq shop and there was this giant Afghan hound, and a guy called Paul who looked like an Afghan hound - tall and thin, big nose and very long hair. Everybody said hello to Homer before they did me. So, you know, that was an immediate interesting starting point.' Pauline helped her boyfriend with his design work, before going back to school to pursue her interest in painting. He went to night school, too, and was taught by a military tailor. By 1976, he was ready to show his menswear on the catwalks of Paris and his signature 'classic-with-a-twist' style was born. In 1979, Smith moved his shop to the capital, and opened up in Covent Garden. His was the first business in Floral Street, where the warehouses were still being used to store bananas. It was a shrewd move. As the area has developed (there is now an M&amp;S round the corner, as well as a couple of Gaps, a Pret A Manger, Nicole Farhi and French Connection), so has his business. Despite his success, he feels he has only recently been taken seriously as a designer in the UK. 'It's so hard to get taken seriously as a fashion designer, because the establishment in Britain thinks you're weird. I think in my case, now, and especially after having the old tap on the shoulder, I think yes I am taken seriously because we've won the Queen's award for export, and we employ a lot of people.' Still, he's frustrated that his womenswear shows, which have been presented on the London catwalks for the past seven seasons, notch up only the odd mention in the papers. 'How many people do you see walking round with chrome conical bras on? How many people do you see sitting in restaurants with bare breasts? What I do is what people want, which is why at British Fashion Week last time I got no press at all - none! But my sales went up 52 per cent. I don't need the headlines. There's no point. I find it disappointing, that's all. If I was showing in Italy, I'd be in the papers because they respect fashion as an industry, as an earner of wages, a creator of jobs, a supporter of families, as a creator of taxes. You would show a simple navy blue suit and it would still be in the papers.' Needless to say, he is contemplating moving his catwalk shows to the Italian fashion capital. The knighthood, last November, came as a surprise to Smith, who had already received a CBE in 1994. It also happened on the day that he and Pauline had arranged to finally get married, a simple registry office job, and then off to a party with friends at the Tate Modern. Typically, Smith, who above all else, is an incorrigible salesman, managed to sell something to one of the ushers during the ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He had forgotten his wife's birthday, and Smith wrote him a note to give to the shop manager: 'I've met this guy at Buck House (honest!). He's a nice bloke and he's forgotten his wife's birthday - give him 20 per cent off.' Another happy customer. 'I'm not sure about having the knighthood,' he says 'It's just in a drawer at home.' He is not really an awards person. He has consistently snubbed the British Fashion Awards. 'It's not right to have an awards ceremony when you haven't got an industry. It's not on - it's just for the wrong reasons. Often, the designer of the year has been on the verge of bankruptcy. I just don't think it's right.' This year, he won the prize for Classic Design, but he didn't attend. His friend, GQ editor Dylan Jones picked up the award on his behalf. While his menswear is still a hit with fashion editors, as well as his customers, his womenswear doesn't set the pulse racing; he has never been a contender for the designer of the year prize. He just isn't 'fashion' enough. 'He's very unspoilt,' says Sophie Hicks. 'Most people who've reached that point would be quite tricky and full of themselves. He's just very natural. Always straightforward. There's no hidden agenda.' Meanwhile, the Italians and the Swiss and the French are still knocking on Smith's door. The Milan shop, with its bold style and unique stock, will only add to their determination. In the long term, Smith might have no option but to sell a percentage. 'The massive dilemma is what happens after Paul Smith,' he says. It's a problem he shares with Giorgio Armani opposite. 'I am 54 years of age. You don't go on forever.' Everything about the brand is so closely tied up with the personality of the man, an investor would worry about what would happen to Paul Smith the brand without Paul Smith the man. As he says, commercially he's his own worst enemy. But then, he really wouldn't have it any other way.",

Recoil as pen-obsessed Pauline, the fascistic restart officer, reduces another hapless bunch of JobSeekers to blubber! Cringe as the paedophiliac tour guide Herr Lipp dispenses spittle-inflected malapropisms in all directions! Tremble as you ponder on the likelihood of pre-op transsexual cabbie Barbara revealing his/her legendary bullet-like nipples! And flee the auditorium, probably as minstrel'd-up MC Papa Lazarou stalks the aisles searching for suitable abductees on which to lavish his uniquely chilling but thoroughly inexplicable admonition: 'You're my wife now, Dave!' (which grounds Hannibal Lecter's pathetic 'ta ta' into the dust). Yes, the show's a bona fide BBC2-ish culty acquired taste; it'll probably attract truckloads of students grateful for any opportunity to bay a succession of catchphrases following the demise of The Fast Show; maybe pilgrims will dress as their favourite characters and turn the whole thing into a Rocky Horror Show. But, for now, the League's creations anatomise the insularity, the quirkery, and the downright oddity of deepest, darkest Britain better than anyone since Monty Python in their heyday, and this is a chance to get as close to them as you dare. To paraphrase Pauline: okey cokey, pig in a pokey - good evening, thrillseekers! \u0095 The League of Gentlemen: A Local Show For Local People , at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Mondays to Saturdays from 12 March to 7 April.

Timetables are tight: a claim for constructive dismissal has to be lodged within three months of departure to go through an industrial tribunal. Claims are also notoriously difficult. As well as proving you were treated unfairly, you must prove it was tantamount to breach of contract. Successful claims often hinge on a unilateral changing of terms - increased hours, for instance. </p> <p>Another successful route is claiming breach of a term which is implied, by law, in every contract - 'mutual trust and confidence'. An employer would be demonstrating withdrawal of trust if it suddenly barred you from meetings you had always attended, your telephone was taken away, or your ability to carry out basic duties. </p> <p>Some workers go for breach of contract in county courts; claims must be lodged within six years.

      "bodyText": "Three years ago I left my job after 40 years. Five years before I left, I took on extra duties, but shortly afterwards had a minor stroke and was off for a few months. When I returned, I found my shifts had been lengthened from 10 to 11 hours. My employer then downgraded my post. Is it too late to claim constructive dismissal? There is little you can do now. Timetables are tight: a claim for constructive dismissal has to be lodged within three months of departure to go through an industrial tribunal. Claims are also notoriously difficult. As well as proving you were treated unfairly, you must prove it was tantamount to breach of contract. Successful claims often hinge on a unilateral changing of terms - increased hours, for instance. Another successful route is claiming breach of a term which is implied, by law, in every contract - 'mutual trust and confidence'. An employer would be demonstrating withdrawal of trust if it suddenly barred you from meetings you had always attended, your telephone was taken away, or your ability to carry out basic duties. Some workers go for breach of contract in county courts; claims must be lodged within six years. But courts expect most disputes to go through tribunals.

      "body": "<p>Three cheers to John Vickers, the new Director General of Fair Trading. </p> <p>Not just for showing, in the case of the banks over the past fortnight, that he has backbone. In certain important instances - notably supermarkets - the new broom at the Office of Fair Trading still needs to stiffen his act. </p> <p>No, congratulations are really due for providing the clearest, most succinct reasons why the on-now-off merger of Abbey National and Bank of Scotland would be a wholly good thing. </p> <p>Naturally, most of the press comment last week, when the OFT finally published its reasoning on the Abbey battle, focused on Vickers' savage indictment of Lloyds TSB's bid, which led to its referral to the Competition Commission. Ignored, really, were indications as to why Vickers waved BoS's deal through: essentially, the potential merger would have to carve out a serious new competitor to the 'big four' not only in current accounts, but in lending to small businesses. </p> <p>One might have expected Abbey, in particular, to have talked this up, given its aspirations to take on the 'big four'. Abbey's timidity in fighting its corner, however, was no more powerfully demonstrated than a fortnight ago, when it called off talks with BoS until the Competition Commission pronounced on Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>Following Vickers' reasoning - and the Competition Commission's interim findings last week on the big banks' grip on the small business market - Abbey chief executive Ian Harley should think again, re-open talks and take the arguments back to his shareholders. </p> <p>What is now much clearer is the struggle Lloyds TSB has to get its rape of Abbey through. Of course, the Competition Commission may canvass options which Lloyds TSB could offer - such as branch disposals or hiving off the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester brand. But satisfactory remedies look far tougher here than in the case of Interbrew's acquisition of Bass Brewers, which was blocked entirely. </p> <p>When the Commission's concerns about small business banking are also taken on board, it is clear that Lloyds TSB's Peter Ellwood has little chance. Waving Lloyds TSB's bid through, with bits nibbled off, would make a mockery of the Government's banking concerns. It is Abbey's potential force in competing for small business lending and current accounts that should count as much as its market share in either segment. </p> <p>As for the Trade &amp; Industry Secretary, decisions on Manchester United/BSkyB, car pricing, supermarkets and Interbrew show that, wisely, Stephen Byers follows his experts' advice. Ellwood would, therefore, be wasting his time lobbying the Minister to do differently. </p> <p>The story throughout this latest banking tussle has been lack of willpower from Abbey. Is Abbey big and ugly enough to have a viable, independent future? Of course. </p> <p>Like the Halifax, Harley should have stuck to this tack. Instead, he undermined his credibility through secret talks with BoS while protesting independence and complaining of a City whispering campaign. Pulling a fast one on BoS chief Peter Burt - by turning a merger into a takeover - was also naive. Abbey's investors simply wouldn't wear it. </p> <p>In all this, however, Harley is the victim, not the villain. That accolade is reserved for the short termism of City institutions. Last week's long-awaited Myners report has a lot to say on that score. </p> <p>Why was Abbey under pressure in the first place?

      "bodyText": "Three cheers to John Vickers, the new Director General of Fair Trading. Not just for showing, in the case of the banks over the past fortnight, that he has backbone. In certain important instances - notably supermarkets - the new broom at the Office of Fair Trading still needs to stiffen his act. No, congratulations are really due for providing the clearest, most succinct reasons why the on-now-off merger of Abbey National and Bank of Scotland would be a wholly good thing. Naturally, most of the press comment last week, when the OFT finally published its reasoning on the Abbey battle, focused on Vickers' savage indictment of Lloyds TSB's bid, which led to its referral to the Competition Commission. Ignored, really, were indications as to why Vickers waved BoS's deal through: essentially, the potential merger would have to carve out a serious new competitor to the 'big four' not only in current accounts, but in lending to small businesses. One might have expected Abbey, in particular, to have talked this up, given its aspirations to take on the 'big four'. Abbey's timidity in fighting its corner, however, was no more powerfully demonstrated than a fortnight ago, when it called off talks with BoS until the Competition Commission pronounced on Lloyds TSB. Following Vickers' reasoning - and the Competition Commission's interim findings last week on the big banks' grip on the small business market - Abbey chief executive Ian Harley should think again, re-open talks and take the arguments back to his shareholders. What is now much clearer is the struggle Lloyds TSB has to get its rape of Abbey through. Of course, the Competition Commission may canvass options which Lloyds TSB could offer - such as branch disposals or hiving off the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester brand. But satisfactory remedies look far tougher here than in the case of Interbrew's acquisition of Bass Brewers, which was blocked entirely. When the Commission's concerns about small business banking are also taken on board, it is clear that Lloyds TSB's Peter Ellwood has little chance. Waving Lloyds TSB's bid through, with bits nibbled off, would make a mockery of the Government's banking concerns. It is Abbey's potential force in competing for small business lending and current accounts that should count as much as its market share in either segment. As for the Trade &amp; Industry Secretary, decisions on Manchester United/BSkyB, car pricing, supermarkets and Interbrew show that, wisely, Stephen Byers follows his experts' advice. Ellwood would, therefore, be wasting his time lobbying the Minister to do differently. The story throughout this latest banking tussle has been lack of willpower from Abbey. Is Abbey big and ugly enough to have a viable, independent future? Of course. Like the Halifax, Harley should have stuck to this tack. Instead, he undermined his credibility through secret talks with BoS while protesting independence and complaining of a City whispering campaign. Pulling a fast one on BoS chief Peter Burt - by turning a merger into a takeover - was also naive. Abbey's investors simply wouldn't wear it. In all this, however, Harley is the victim, not the villain. That accolade is reserved for the short termism of City institutions. Last week's long-awaited Myners report has a lot to say on that score. Why was Abbey under pressure in the first place? Because fund managers needed its share price up to bolster their performance before their quarterly meetings with their clients, the pension fund trustees. Why has Abbey balked at revealing the terms of its merger with BoS? Because, for the same reasons, City shareholders made it clear they prefer the higher price Lloyds might still offer, to the longer-term gains of an Abbey/BoS merger. After last week's trio of announcements - from Vickers, the Commission and Myners - Harley should now reopen talks with Burt and take the deal to institutions with a vengeance. The clear, pathbreaking alternative is for Burt to lay out the terms and do so himself. That would not be so much a 'hostile merger' as fearless taking of the lead. And it would not be very different from BoS's ground-breaking move on NatWest which, though unsuccessful, enhanced Burt's standing no end. Cream for a few, dry cake for many Barclays' accounts, issued last week, make interesting reading. And not just for the huge package enjoyed by Canadian chief executive Matt Barrett. Totting up the whole panoply of salary, bonus, private pension contributions, awards of shares and profits on share options, that came to a mighty \u00a32.8 million last year - not the \u00a31.7m widely reported last week. The accounts are particularly illuminating about Barclays Capital, which runs the bank's remaining investment banking operations following the sale of BZW in 1998. As we reveal today, last year bonuses at Barclays Capital (and Barclays Global Investors, the fund management arm) accounted for pretty much all of the bank's \u00a3172m increase in salary-related costs. Put another way, just 6,400 of Barclays' 80,000 staff (including agency workers) got the cream, while the rest ate crumbling cake. Barclays still has a whiff of the BZWs about it, and there is a moral for investors, too. Barclays Capital lifted profits by \u00a392m last year to \u00a3403m, a healthy rise of 30 per cent. Income, however, rose much more, by \u00a3310m - as did costs, by \u00a3193m. That means for every \u00a31 of extra revenue, the investment bankers took 62p out, leaving shareholders with just 38p. (At BGI, the fund managers took 82p of every new pound earned.) Just compare that with the retail network, where costs were flat, but income rose by \u00a3400m.

But a Sixties soap set in a Midlands motel which flatlined in the Eighties does not exactly scream 'resuscitate'. </p> <p>Yet last week more than 2 million people tuned in for the first episode of the new look Crossroads . Very new look in fact. The setting has shifted from the West to the East Midlands and, shock horror, the motel has gone. </p> <p>'We couldn't find a motel; they no longer exist,' says Lord Waheed Alli, who brought the soap back from TV purgatory. 'It would have been silly to pretend other wise, so we went for a four star hotel - very comfortable rooms.' </p> <p>Sitting in the House of Parliament canteen, Alli, small and intense, is clearly excited about the launch of his 'baby': 'I grew up with Crossroads , and I'm anxious to see whether people think we've done justice to it. Hearing that music come up is brilliant.' </p> <p>Alli breaks off to hum the soap's annoying signature tune. He and his partner, Charlie Parsons, who co-founded TV production house Planet 24 with Bob Geldof, wanted to remake the soap a few years ago, but the company which owned the rights wouldn't sell. </p> <p>Then, two years ago, Alli, Parsons and Geldof sold Planet, maker of The Big Breakfast and The Word , to Carlton for \u00a315 million, a deal which reportedly earned Alli \u00a35m. The sale cleared the way for him to make a renewed attempt to bring the soap back. He had joined Carlton as managing director of its programming arm, with a brief from chief executive Michael Green to shake up the division. In came Lily Savage and a deal was signed with Ragdoll Productions, maker of Teletubbies , to provide more children's programming. The company also invested in a raft of new prime-time dramas. And then came Crossroads . </p> <p>'I don't know why I loved the old Crossroads , but you have very few times in your life when you have the creative freedom to do what you want, and we wanted to bring it back.' </p> <p>The chance came when Channel 5 launched its audacious and successful bid to poach Aussie soap Home and Away from ITV. Alli pounced, seizing the weekday slot for his baby. While soaps tend not to be the greatest revenue drivers for networks, making Crossroads was not about economics, Alli says. It was part of a rebranding exercise, something that is yielding dramatic results - albeit after Alli quit Carlton to concentrate on politics. </p> <p>'I know I changed the face of Carlton,' Alli says proudly, a sentence which nearly causes Keith Vaz MP, sitting nearby, to choke on his lunch. </p> <p>'What's this: Lord Alli, my life story?' Vaz asks. </p> <p>'Keith I'm talking to the Observer ,' Alli says playfully. Vaz doesn't say much after that. </p> <p>Alli argues that consolidation among media companies means content is now at a premium. 'It's inevitable that Carlton and Granada will merge. Channel 5 is going to RTL. The challenge now is to build brands across the platforms, and this is why content is so important. Content may not be king just yet, but it's close. It's more like queen at the moment.'These days, Alli doesn't get too heavily involved in the production side of things. He's concentrating on his next offspring: winning the next election for Labour. </p> <p>Alli was probably New Labour before New Labour. Media savvy and, like all Labour apparatchiks, a mix of the urban and the urbane, Alli left school at 16 to find a job so he could support his immigrant parents. It's a stark contrast to the wealth he now enjoys, and his generosity is legendary. He once bought Big Breakfast star Denise Van Outen a \u00a325,000 diamond necklace as a Christmas present. </p> <p>Other details about Alli's rise to media moguldom are sketchy. A close friend of both Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair, he doesn't do many interviews. He has been targeted by racist and homophobic groups, most notably over his opposition to Clause 28. </p> <p>After the election, Alli will probably spend more time building his portfolio of part-time careers. He's looking for a directorship with a blue chip FTSE company to add to the non-executive directorship he holds at Tornado Group, a company that specialises in distributing content over the internet. He is also chairman of the The Digital Radio Group. </p> <p>The two positions seem incongruous at first. 'If you look at Tornado, it seems an odd choice,' says Alli. 'But it's a business I understand. It's about delivering creatively. I love working with creative talent. I love making things.' </p> <p>He's keen to stress that although Tornado is involved with the internet, it's not a dotcom company, complete with short shelf-life and terrifying cash burn rate. </p> <p>Alli is scornful of the institutions that created the internet bubble: 'The people to blame are the venture capitalists. You can't give that sort of money to inexperienced managers. But now we've gone from one extreme to another, and the market has completely dried up.' </p> <p>Alli was offered the chairmanship of DRG, which holds London's third digital radio licence, when he left Carlton. The group is a consortium made up of GWR, Scottish Media Group, Emap, the Carphone Warehouse and Kelvin Mackenzie's Wireless Group. </p> <p>Again, radio is not something Alli would seem to know much about. But he argues that the consortium, which has yet to launch its digital channels, is all about choice, something he does understand. 'For instance we have an Asian service, which I'd like to listen to. And there's a gay service, which I'll probably tune into.' However, he's not too sure he'll be a regular listener to the country music channel - it's not very New Labour after all. </p> <p>But the problem is that no one listens to digital radio. The sets are prohibitively priced and the demand for the new medium just isn't there. </p> <p>'This is not a short-term project,' says Alli. 'But one day the Government will switch off analogue. Radio is going through a growth perception problem. It's seen as old media but it is growing audiences. Not many are doing that.' </p> <p>And what about Mackenzie, who, when editor of the Sun was not exactly renowned for his appreciation of multi-cultural, multisexual Britain. 'I've yet to meet him, but I'm looking forward to it. The world's moved on from when Kelvin was at the Sun . Today we don't have an editor of the Sun who goes round outing people. It's much less homophobic.' </p> <p>Alli could have been in the newspaper game himself if his bid to buy the Star last year had been successful. 'We didn't get it. Richard Desmond [owner of Northern &amp; Shell, publisher of OK! and numerous pornographic magazines] was far quicker and far more adept.' Alli, it transpires, is a big fan of Desmond. </p> <p>'Richard's enthusiasm is amazing. The Express papers are looking much better since he took over. They look like winners.' You wouldn't expect a Labour lord to say anything else in the run-up to an election, but soon Alli won't have to play the political card so much. Alli and Parsons met with Geldof the other week for a spot of brain-storming. Alli grins at the recollection. </p> <p>'We've had to rest for a couple of years, which is contrary to our instincts. But when all three of us met up the sparks were flying.' What next? The return of El Dorado ... The Newcomers ... Compact ? We hold our breath.</p>",

      "body": "<p>You can cut your British Gas bill by 11 per cent if you pay by direct debit, cutting \u00a334 off a fairly typical annual bill of \u00a3309, according to the company. But, depending on the date that it last read your meter, you could find the direct debit payments are above what they should be. </p> <p>This is what happened to one of our readers, known here as Mr A Pensioner. His latest statement from BG in late February told him that his gas consumption had risen by 14 per cent. BG therefore wanted to increase his monthly direct debit from \u00a328.50 to \u00a332.50. </p> <p>But when he looked closer at the statement, he realised that most of the reason for the 14 per cent increase came from the fact the statement covered 55 and a half weeks. </p> <p>In fact his consumption had barely risen at all if he calculated the cost over 52 weeks to make it comparable with the previous year. In doing this, he seems to have done a calculation that is beyond the BG computer. Staff describe it as sophisticated in that it can produce direct debit projections that alter according to the number of people living in the house and weather conditions in that part of the country. </p> <p>But many other people will find themselves in a similar position to Mr Pensioner. BG, which introduced quarterly rather than six-monthly meter readings last April, sends its meter readers to knock on your door in a window of time between 90 and 111 days after your last reading. Since a quarter of a year actually falls on the 91st day, this means that readings will tend to be for longer periods than a quarter. If you have not had your meter read in two years, BG is obliged to do all it can to get one, and will extend the window to 121 days. </p> <p>When Mr Pensioner rang BG, the company was more than happy to accept his argument and left his monthly direct debit unchanged at \u00a328.50. But this only happened because he took the initiative. He says: 'It would have had \u00a348 more from me during the year than was needed. If just another 20,000 people are in the same position, then that gives British Gas \u00a31 million to earn interest on for a while.' </p> <p>As BG says, people do pay the right amount in the end.

      "bodyText": "You can cut your British Gas bill by 11 per cent if you pay by direct debit, cutting \u00a334 off a fairly typical annual bill of \u00a3309, according to the company. But, depending on the date that it last read your meter, you could find the direct debit payments are above what they should be. This is what happened to one of our readers, known here as Mr A Pensioner. His latest statement from BG in late February told him that his gas consumption had risen by 14 per cent. BG therefore wanted to increase his monthly direct debit from \u00a328.50 to \u00a332.50. But when he looked closer at the statement, he realised that most of the reason for the 14 per cent increase came from the fact the statement covered 55 and a half weeks. In fact his consumption had barely risen at all if he calculated the cost over 52 weeks to make it comparable with the previous year. In doing this, he seems to have done a calculation that is beyond the BG computer. Staff describe it as sophisticated in that it can produce direct debit projections that alter according to the number of people living in the house and weather conditions in that part of the country. But many other people will find themselves in a similar position to Mr Pensioner. BG, which introduced quarterly rather than six-monthly meter readings last April, sends its meter readers to knock on your door in a window of time between 90 and 111 days after your last reading. Since a quarter of a year actually falls on the 91st day, this means that readings will tend to be for longer periods than a quarter. If you have not had your meter read in two years, BG is obliged to do all it can to get one, and will extend the window to 121 days. When Mr Pensioner rang BG, the company was more than happy to accept his argument and left his monthly direct debit unchanged at \u00a328.50. But this only happened because he took the initiative. He says: 'It would have had \u00a348 more from me during the year than was needed. If just another 20,000 people are in the same position, then that gives British Gas \u00a31 million to earn interest on for a while.' As BG says, people do pay the right amount in the end. You can get overpayments refunded if you ask BG during the year or it will cut down next year's direct debits if you have paid too much. But it has still had use of your money for a year, and you have lost the use of it. Many people could find that they are paying too much during the course of a year. Mr Pensioner is particularly worried about other pensioners who may be living on tight budgets. BG says that its computer system can also throw out underpayments in its direct debit calculations as well. But it will not give statistics on the numbers of over- and underpayments to back up its assertions. And there is plenty of room for overpayments in the accounts of Centrica, which owns British Gas and its other energy businesses. The latest Centrica accounts up to 31 December 2000 showed \u00a32.7 billion due to be repaid to customers.",

The scheme is particularly hard hit because many of its members have retired and are now drawing their pensions. </p> <p>Representatives are this month asking for it to be improved from a 1/80th scheme (giving 1/80th of a teacher's final salary as pension for each year paying into the scheme) to a 1/60th scheme. In a submission to the Department for Education and Employment(DfEE), the teachers' side of the teachers' superannuation working party is also calling for pensions to be paid to all surviving partners - including gay partners and cohabitees as well as spouses - and for partners' pensions to be paid for life, rather than being stopped if the survivor remarries or lives with someone else. Negotiations about the terms are likely to start in April. </p> <p>'The teachers' pension scheme isn't a particularly wonderful scheme, although it does provide inflation-proofing,' says actuary Bryn Davies of Union Pension Services. The scheme came 143rd out of 275 schemes when ranked in terms of value of benefits by Bryn Davies in his latest comparison of major schemes, Pension Scheme Profiles 2000. </p> <p>The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) is expected to ask for a range of changes, including a move away from the current unfunded basis to a funded arrangement. At the moment, the scheme collects contributions from both teachers and their employers (usually local authorities), but rather than going into a pension fund, the money goes into Treasury coffers. When teachers retire, their pension is paid by the Treasury again. This means that there is no actual fund. </p> <p>NASUWT pensions officer Brian Clegg is worried that future politicians could try to water down benefits or get teachers to pay in more. 'The campaign has got to be for a real fund,' he says. 'The long-term liabilities of the scheme are just unaffordable, and the problem just comes back to being reliant on the Treasury.' </p> <p>Data on the scheme is always out of date. The latest valuation from the Government Actuary's Department relates to 1996, but has yet to be published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office. But the valuation report, which has been seen by The Observer , reveals that there were nearly 560,000 teachers paying in at that time. There were nearly 365,000 teachers and their widows and widowers drawing pensions. As the actuary states in the report that in the five years that the report covers, 'expenditure on benefits exceeded the contribution income'. </p> <p>A scheme in this situation is described as 'mature' when the number of pensioners is very high compared with the number of 'active' contributing members. This means that the scheme is costly. Clegg is therefore worried that politicians could be tempted to tinker. </p> <p>As Davies says: 'For years and years, the government has had pensions on the cheap.' Even 20 years ago, the Government would have been receiving far more in contributions than the Treasury had to pay out. But now the past is catching up very fast. The proportion of pensioners compared with active members was 65 per cent in 1996, up from 53 per cent in 1991. </p> <p>The government actuary has also predicted a deficit on the scheme of \u00a34 billion when future liabilities are taken into account. As a result, the employers' contri bution is due to increase from 7.2 per cent of each teacher's salary now to 8.15 per cent from April 2002. In theory, the \u00a34bn shortfall would be made up by these extra contributions over the next 40 years. </p> <p>Part of the reason for the shortfall is an accounting practice which has notionally invested the contributions received into fixed- interest stocks. But returns would have been far higher if the notional investment had been the stock market. Most funded pension schemes invest well over 60 per cent of their assets in equities, in the expectation of rates of return far higher than on fixed-interest stocks. The Government has now conceded the point and is starting to operate the scheme's notional accounts as if the investments were largely in equities. </p> <p>Barry Fawcett will be one of the main negotiators with the DfEE in April. As head of pay and pensions at the NUT, he takes some heart from improvements that are being made to the civil service pension scheme. This scheme is soon to pay pension benefits to gay and cohabiting partners, for instance. Fawcett says: 'Many key improvements are being introduced to the civil service scheme and there is no reason why teachers should not be granted the same terms as other public service employees.' </p> <p>The teachers' scheme was established in 1925 and had its last major overhaul in 1972. From a financial viewpoint, the 1/80th basis is something of a legacy of the past. Most schemes which are seen as attractive these days offer a 1/60th arrangement.</p>",

There were nearly 365,000 teachers and their widows and widowers drawing pensions. As the actuary states in the report that in the five years that the report covers, 'expenditure on benefits exceeded the contribution income'. A scheme in this situation is described as 'mature' when the number of pensioners is very high compared with the number of 'active' contributing members. This means that the scheme is costly. Clegg is therefore worried that politicians could be tempted to tinker. As Davies says: 'For years and years, the government has had pensions on the cheap.' Even 20 years ago, the Government would have been receiving far more in contributions than the Treasury had to pay out. But now the past is catching up very fast. The proportion of pensioners compared with active members was 65 per cent in 1996, up from 53 per cent in 1991. The government actuary has also predicted a deficit on the scheme of \u00a34 billion when future liabilities are taken into account. As a result, the employers' contri bution is due to increase from 7.2 per cent of each teacher's salary now to 8.15 per cent from April 2002. In theory, the \u00a34bn shortfall would be made up by these extra contributions over the next 40 years. Part of the reason for the shortfall is an accounting practice which has notionally invested the contributions received into fixed- interest stocks. But returns would have been far higher if the notional investment had been the stock market. Most funded pension schemes invest well over 60 per cent of their assets in equities, in the expectation of rates of return far higher than on fixed-interest stocks. The Government has now conceded the point and is starting to operate the scheme's notional accounts as if the investments were largely in equities. Barry Fawcett will be one of the main negotiators with the DfEE in April. As head of pay and pensions at the NUT, he takes some heart from improvements that are being made to the civil service pension scheme. This scheme is soon to pay pension benefits to gay and cohabiting partners, for instance. Fawcett says: 'Many key improvements are being introduced to the civil service scheme and there is no reason why teachers should not be granted the same terms as other public service employees.' The teachers' scheme was established in 1925 and had its last major overhaul in 1972. From a financial viewpoint, the 1/80th basis is something of a legacy of the past. Most schemes which are seen as attractive these days offer a 1/60th arrangement.",

      "body": "<p>Corporate bond Isas are a popular option for income investors. First there is the high level of income. Then there's the tax advantage over equity Isas - income from bonds is taxed as interest at 20 per cent which is reclaimable in full, whereas dividend income comes with only a 10 per cent reclaimable tax credit (nil from April 2004).</p> <p>But there has always been a nagging doubt that investors are not totally sure what it is they are buying. Sold on the basis of providing a relatively high income while being 'less risky' than equities, the corporate bond market remains, for many, clouded in mystery.</p> <p>And it is easy to get confused. Take the current situation, for example: Corporate bonds are effectively IOUs issued by companies. Companies are having a hard time of it, with profit warnings coming thick and fast and share values falling in the stock market. </p> <p>So, presumably, corporate bonds are not such a good deal these days? Not so, say the experts. An economy in trouble means lower interest rates, which is good news for corporate bonds. With declining interest rates, people are keener to lock into a high fixed rate. Yields on bonds appear more attractive so prices go up. </p> <p>And a stock market in trouble means investors are likely to switch out of equities into the safer haven of bonds, so again prices go up.</p> <p>'We see a fairly positive outlook for the corporate bond sector,' says Roger Webb, fund manager at Morley Fund Management, the investment arm of Norwich Union. 'The backdrop is much riskier for equities than it is for bonds.'</p> <p>The problem, as he concedes, is that there are bonds and bonds. At the top end, bonds issued by top notch companies are not much riskier than government securities. </p> <p>At the other extreme, you can be buying the IOUs of companies which have already filed for bankruptcy.</p> <p>Most corporate bonds are rated by either Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) or Moody's, on a scale from triple A, down to a C rating. The lower the rating, the more the company has to pay in interest to get people to accept their IOUs.</p> <p>Everything above a triple B rating on the S&amp;P scale is called 'investment grade' and anything below this grade, where the risk of default is higher, is called 'high yield'. </p> <p>Almost 100 bond funds are available, ranging from the ultra safe, offering yields of around 5 per cent, through to the higher-risk end, where you can earn 8 to 9 per cent or more.</p> <p>'Corporate bond funds are a good home for those looking for income,' says Colin Jackson of Baronworth Investment Services. 'But investors must know what they are buying. Too many people just look at the headline rate. They seem to think the rate is guaranteed and their money is safe; it isn't.'</p> <p>The experts disagree about where the best bargains are to be found at present. Paul Reed, head of fixed interest at Aberdeen Unit Trust Managers, reckons that there isn't anything very exciting about ?bonds linked closely to government gilts. 'But if you go for slightly higher yields, the returns more than take care of the possible risks.'</p> <p>Webb is more positive about the top-graded corporate bonds. 'The high-yield market looks expensive,' he says. He likes the telecoms sectors, 'where the market has already priced in most of the bad news'.</p> <p>So what funds do independent advisers like? Tim Cockerill of IFAs Chartwell likes the Norwich Union, going for the company's Corporate Bond Fund, yielding around 5.9 per cent, and the NU Higher Income Plus Fund yielding around 7.7 per cent as his low- and high-risk options.</p> <p>Alan Durrant of Hargreaves Lansdown selects the Schroder High Yield Bond Fund, yielding around 5.9 per cent as his more conservative choice, with the Royal Sun Alliance Extra Income Bond Fund, yielding more than 8 per cent as his high-return option.</p>",

But there has always been a nagging doubt that investors are not totally sure what it is they are buying. Sold on the basis of providing a relatively high income while being 'less risky' than equities, the corporate bond market remains, for many, clouded in mystery. And it is easy to get confused. Take the current situation, for example: Corporate bonds are effectively IOUs issued by companies. Companies are having a hard time of it, with profit warnings coming thick and fast and share values falling in the stock market. So, presumably, corporate bonds are not such a good deal these days? Not so, say the experts. An economy in trouble means lower interest rates, which is good news for corporate bonds. With declining interest rates, people are keener to lock into a high fixed rate. Yields on bonds appear more attractive so prices go up. And a stock market in trouble means investors are likely to switch out of equities into the safer haven of bonds, so again prices go up. 'We see a fairly positive outlook for the corporate bond sector,' says Roger Webb, fund manager at Morley Fund Management, the investment arm of Norwich Union. 'The backdrop is much riskier for equities than it is for bonds.' The problem, as he concedes, is that there are bonds and bonds. At the top end, bonds issued by top notch companies are not much riskier than government securities. At the other extreme, you can be buying the IOUs of companies which have already filed for bankruptcy. Most corporate bonds are rated by either Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) or Moody's, on a scale from triple A, down to a C rating. The lower the rating, the more the company has to pay in interest to get people to accept their IOUs. Everything above a triple B rating on the S&amp;P scale is called 'investment grade' and anything below this grade, where the risk of default is higher, is called 'high yield'. Almost 100 bond funds are available, ranging from the ultra safe, offering yields of around 5 per cent, through to the higher-risk end, where you can earn 8 to 9 per cent or more. 'Corporate bond funds are a good home for those looking for income,' says Colin Jackson of Baronworth Investment Services. 'But investors must know what they are buying. Too many people just look at the headline rate. They seem to think the rate is guaranteed and their money is safe; it isn't.' The experts disagree about where the best bargains are to be found at present. Paul Reed, head of fixed interest at Aberdeen Unit Trust Managers, reckons that there isn't anything very exciting about ?bonds linked closely to government gilts. 'But if you go for slightly higher yields, the returns more than take care of the possible risks.' Webb is more positive about the top-graded corporate bonds. 'The high-yield market looks expensive,' he says. He likes the telecoms sectors, 'where the market has already priced in most of the bad news'. So what funds do independent advisers like? Tim Cockerill of IFAs Chartwell likes the Norwich Union, going for the company's Corporate Bond Fund, yielding around 5.9 per cent, and the NU Higher Income Plus Fund yielding around 7.7 per cent as his low- and high-risk options. Alan Durrant of Hargreaves Lansdown selects the Schroder High Yield Bond Fund, yielding around 5.9 per cent as his more conservative choice, with the Royal Sun Alliance Extra Income Bond Fund, yielding more than 8 per cent as his high-return option.",

Ethical investment has come on a long journey in Britain since 1984 when Friends Provident unveiled its pioneering Stewardship fund on a highly sceptical City and proved that there was a market for people who wanted to know where their money would be invested.

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 index has fallen by more than 5 per cent so far this year and is now 15 per cent below its all-time high. The Techmark index of technology shares has fallen a painful 60 per cent from its peak; the US's Nasdaq is down by a similar amount. Experts say things could get worse before they get better. Why, then, should anyone consider investing in an equities Isa right now? The short answer is that cautious investors probably should not - and the brave should be extremely selective about where they put their money. 'There are lots of lovely stocks which will eventually look very cheap,' says Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. 'But don't trust the market. We can see clear water ahead, perhaps in a year's time. And we can see where we are now. But in between, there is a big patch of fog.' The big uncertainty is the US. Companies as diverse as Motorola and Procter &amp; Gamble have been issuing profit warnings, consumer confidence is plummeting and unemployment is rising. Even the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the omniscient Alan Greenspan, believes thing could get worse. Most analysts still believe the US downturn will follow the traditional 'v' shape - a sharp drop in economic activity followed by an equally sharp recovery. But that is not guaranteed, and it will be months before it is clear whether they are right. Even if they are, company profits are unlikely to follow the same pattern, warns Jeremy Batstone of NatWest Stockbrokers. 'People say the downturn is a demand thing: as soon as demand recovers, companies can put their prices. It is not. The problem is overcapacity around the world, which means companies have no pricing power.' Certainly, the stock markets are not behaving as they should. Traditionally, shares have risen sharply immediately after a cut in interest rates - and technology shares more than most - as investors anticipate economic recovery. That did happen this time round: markets here and in the US surged in the wake of the Fed's unexpected rate cuts at the start of the year. But the euphoria was short-lived, and the gains have been more than reversed in the past few weeks. That can largely be traced back to the tech euphoria of last spring. Excitement about the potential of the internet and new generation mobile phones encouraged companies to invest billions in building up stocks - and investors to pour billions of their savings into these companies.

      "body": "<p>Ugly scenes in a beautiful city. True, there has been some exceptional cricket played. Mahela Jayawardena hit an enchanting century; we could admire Nasser Hussain's grit as he hit himself out of his slump; the irrepressible vim of Darren Gough, Kumar Sangakkara's counterattack and the doggedness of Kumar Dharmesena. </p> <p>But these stirring efforts were too often overshadowed by so many distasteful incidents on and off the field. The match has aroused some ugly passions. There's something wrong when one of the local papers headlines its match report with 'Cooray bats for England'. Or when well-heeled English tourists sitting in the posh seats with access to TV and all those replays yell 'Out, out,' at Sanath Jayasuriya as he leaves the field, another victim of another umpiring cock-up. </p> <p>Or when one of the umpires (Cooray) requires the presence of an armed guard as he returns to the pavilion after another tortuous day. Or when Jayasuriya throws his helmet in disgust and Mike Atherton has finger-wagging conversations with Sangakkara and Rudi Koertzen out in the middle. Or when the most sought-after individual at the close of play is not the centurion or the wicket-taker but the match referee Hanumant Singh, who emerges with the latest tally of penalties. </p> <p>If anything there were more umpiring howlers here than in the first Test. The two coaches, Dav Whatmore and Duncan Fletcher, have chosen their words carefully, anxious to defuse the situation. Whatmore craves two 'neutral' umpires to take the pressure off the home man; Fletcher pleads that technology should be used. Whatmore agrees. At last some unanimity between the two sides. </p> <p>The players of both sides have overstepped the mark in this match; several have been punished or censured but - my goodness - there has been some provocation. There is some truth in the standard line: the players have put the umpires under intolerable pressure; the converse argument has some merit too; the umpires have put the players under intolerable pressure. </p> <p>Two of the most mild-mannered have been in the dock, Jayasuriya and Atherton (this is not yet an adjective that we can yet apply to Sangakkara). Jayasuriya has been the most dignified of cricketers. Quite how he was supposed to react as he headed towards a stand of baying English spectators after another miscarriage of justice, I'm not sure. Atherton perpetrated the only act in the match that could be interpreted as 'sporting' when he suggested that his 'catch' at slip from the bat of Russel Arnold should be referred to the third umpire. If these two are taxing the mind of the match referee then the game is spinning out of control, a situation not helped by the constant but inevitable dissection of every error or misdemeanour on the TV screens. </p> <p>What to do? The referral system, which is the brainchild of Duncan Fletcher, should be examined swiftly and experiments carried out. To some it is too contrived. The romantics crave a return to the 'old days' when players simply trusted one another. Call me a clich\u00e9-ridden old cynic, if you like, but this smacks of putting the toothpaste back in the tube.</p> <p>Tony Greig (not an obvious romantic) among others has utopian leanings. He would like to see the two captains/coaches get together before a match or a series and agree that the players should run the game. But the lines are too blurred. No one has been walking for 40 years or more. There have always been 'optimistic' appeals. One aberration of some idealistic code - and there would be one - and we are back to square one. The players have to be cajoled into behaving properly. It has to be in their interests to do so. </p> <p>The beauty of the referral system is that good appeals to the third umpire are rewarded, bad ones are penalised with the loss of a referral. The system would not be foolproof; there would still be plenty of controversies to keep us all happy. But it should at least reduce the number of errors, which in turn might lessen so many repetitions of the unseemly incidents that have marred what might have been a magnificent Test match in Kandy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ugly scenes in a beautiful city. True, there has been some exceptional cricket played. Mahela Jayawardena hit an enchanting century; we could admire Nasser Hussain's grit as he hit himself out of his slump; the irrepressible vim of Darren Gough, Kumar Sangakkara's counterattack and the doggedness of Kumar Dharmesena. But these stirring efforts were too often overshadowed by so many distasteful incidents on and off the field. The match has aroused some ugly passions. There's something wrong when one of the local papers headlines its match report with 'Cooray bats for England'. Or when well-heeled English tourists sitting in the posh seats with access to TV and all those replays yell 'Out, out,' at Sanath Jayasuriya as he leaves the field, another victim of another umpiring cock-up. Or when one of the umpires (Cooray) requires the presence of an armed guard as he returns to the pavilion after another tortuous day. Or when Jayasuriya throws his helmet in disgust and Mike Atherton has finger-wagging conversations with Sangakkara and Rudi Koertzen out in the middle. Or when the most sought-after individual at the close of play is not the centurion or the wicket-taker but the match referee Hanumant Singh, who emerges with the latest tally of penalties. If anything there were more umpiring howlers here than in the first Test. The two coaches, Dav Whatmore and Duncan Fletcher, have chosen their words carefully, anxious to defuse the situation. Whatmore craves two 'neutral' umpires to take the pressure off the home man; Fletcher pleads that technology should be used. Whatmore agrees. At last some unanimity between the two sides. The players of both sides have overstepped the mark in this match; several have been punished or censured but - my goodness - there has been some provocation. There is some truth in the standard line: the players have put the umpires under intolerable pressure; the converse argument has some merit too; the umpires have put the players under intolerable pressure. Two of the most mild-mannered have been in the dock, Jayasuriya and Atherton (this is not yet an adjective that we can yet apply to Sangakkara). Jayasuriya has been the most dignified of cricketers. Quite how he was supposed to react as he headed towards a stand of baying English spectators after another miscarriage of justice, I'm not sure. Atherton perpetrated the only act in the match that could be interpreted as 'sporting' when he suggested that his 'catch' at slip from the bat of Russel Arnold should be referred to the third umpire. If these two are taxing the mind of the match referee then the game is spinning out of control, a situation not helped by the constant but inevitable dissection of every error or misdemeanour on the TV screens. What to do? The referral system, which is the brainchild of Duncan Fletcher, should be examined swiftly and experiments carried out. To some it is too contrived. The romantics crave a return to the 'old days' when players simply trusted one another. Call me a clich\u00e9-ridden old cynic, if you like, but this smacks of putting the toothpaste back in the tube. Tony Greig (not an obvious romantic) among others has utopian leanings. He would like to see the two captains/coaches get together before a match or a series and agree that the players should run the game. But the lines are too blurred. No one has been walking for 40 years or more. There have always been 'optimistic' appeals. One aberration of some idealistic code - and there would be one - and we are back to square one. The players have to be cajoled into behaving properly. It has to be in their interests to do so. The beauty of the referral system is that good appeals to the third umpire are rewarded, bad ones are penalised with the loss of a referral. The system would not be foolproof; there would still be plenty of controversies to keep us all happy. But it should at least reduce the number of errors, which in turn might lessen so many repetitions of the unseemly incidents that have marred what might have been a magnificent Test match in Kandy.",

      "body": "<p>For once, cricket was almost the dominant strand of another gripping, gruelling day in the Sri Lankan sun. There was the usual quota of dodgy umpiring decisions and the standard disciplinary hearing at the close of play, but in between an enthralling, nail-biting struggle took place in the middle. </p> <p>There is no point having too many preconceived ideas out here and this does not just apply to the decisions of the umpires. Upon arrival we assumed that the fourth day would be the last of the match and that England would be able to head for Colombo with the series safely squared. We left having waited for the deliberations of referee Hanumant Singh and the match in the balance with England needing 70 runs for victory with six wickets remaining. It was Sri Lanka's day, but it still may be England's match. Avid followers, chomping their cornflakes, will know for certain by now. </p> <p>England will not have been overjoyed that their chief obstacle was Kumar Sangakkara - not their favourite cricketer. Sangakkara is not worried about that. 'If they don't like me that's their problem,' said this articulate law student. 'Any regrets about the way you have played this game?' he was asked. Quick as a flash he responded 'Yes.' We waited eagerly for a confessional. 'I'm very disappointed with the shot I played against Robert Croft.' Sangakkara really does seem to relish the cut, thrust and parry of the modern Test. </p> <p>He has his limitations behind the stumps, but he is only a makeshift wicketkeeper. However, he is clearly a special talent as a batsman. Yesterday he shrugged off the hostile vibes and hit a defiant 95 before losing his compo sure spectacularly. It looked as if he was trying to reach his maiden century with a six as he galloped down the pitch to heave and miss at Croft to be stumped five minutes before lunch, a dismissal that Stewart seemed to relish even more than usual. </p> <p>But Sangakkara and his dutiful ally, Kumar Dharmesena, had done some damage. Together they had taken Sri Lanka's fragile overnight total of 98 for six to 187 for seven against an uneven English attack. Darren Gough, his competitive instincts aroused, was superb, but Ashley Giles was inconsistent. Hardly surprising that Giles was visibly frustrated when Dharmesena on 19 was given not out after an appeal for a catch at silly point. Inevitably BC Cooray was the umpire; inevitably the replays suggested that the ball had hit the bat after the pad. Cooray was at least displaying some consistency, I suppose. </p> <p>Sangakkara played some thrilling strokes: punched drives off the back foot, silky ones off the front. Nor was he afraid to loft the spinners. He gave one chance, a tough caught-and-bowled to Craig White on 89. Only over-exuberance prevented him reaching his century.The England players, whether they like it or not, will be seeing much more of Sangakkara. Odd really: Atherton usually takes to people with brains. </p> <p>After the break England were convinced that Chaminda Vaas was dismissed by Croft, easily the more impressive of the two English spinners. Again it was an appeal for a bat-pad catch to Thorpe; again Cooray was unconvinced. The players reacted sanguinely to the rejection of that appeal; maybe they are getting used to the new rules. </p> <p>There were seven consecutive maidens at the start of that afternoon session but the Sri Lankan innings gradually gained momentum. Vaas began to chance his arm with success, top-edging a hook to the boundary off White; Dharmesena swept Croft for four and England were creaking in several areas. The Sri Lankan tail was looking untroubled and Nasser Hussain tweaked a groin muscle and was compelled to leave the field for a while (Stewart took over). So much hinged on the second new ball, which was taken as soon as it was available. </p> <p>Vaas was soon dropped by Stewart down the leg side off Gough and it took seven overs before the new ball did the trick. Then the indefatigable Gough conjured some steep bounce and Graeme Hick took a fine catch above his head at second slip to end Dharmesena's three-and-three-quarter hours of determined resistance. In Gough's next over, Hick obliged again to dispose of Nuwan Zoysa. Muttiah Muralitharan clubbed one mammoth six over midwicket from Gough's off-cutter but the replacement of Caddick by White finally enabled England to know what their target would be in this match. Vaas hit White's first ball straight to cover. </p> <p>England replied aggressively in pursuit of 161 but both openers were gone by the end of the seventh over. Trescothick with two cuts and Atherton (two cover drives) found the boundary but then Vaas intervened. </p> <p>Atherton is becoming ever more like Boycott - seemingly impregnable except when he is facing subcontinental left-armers. He nicked Vaas to Sangakkara again but stood his ground. There was no doubt that he had touched the ball, but given recent history between these two players there was no way that he was going to leave the field without confirmation that the ball had carried. Cooray wisely consulted the third umpire, who could see that it had. </p> <p>There followed a sterling half-century partnership between a hobbling Hussain and an inspired Thorpe, who threatened to take the game away from the Sri Lankans. Somehow on 17 he survived an lbw appeal against Dharmesena (the umpire was Rudi Koertzen so there did not seem to be so many replays). Otherwise Thorpe's mind was sharp and his touch sure as he resolved to take the initiative. Murali was taken for 20 in his first two overs as Thorpe cut, drove, swept and edged him to the boundary. Hussain occasionally managed a crisp cover drive off Jayasuriya. </p> <p>Yet both were gone by the close. Thorpe was eventually too ambitious against Murali. This time the ball he chose to cut was a little too close to him and it bounced more than he expected. Sangakkara took the catch. Sangakkara was celebrating again within minutes as Vaas returned and won a caught-behind appeal against Hussain. The England captain looked disgruntled, but it is a foolish man who draws too many conclusions from that in this day and age. So it was left to Stewart and the night watchman Croft to take England to the close of a thrilling, sapping day. </p> <p>England could not afford to look ahead any further than the taut session that awaited them on Sunday morning. Even though the final Test at Colombo starts on Thursday that was still out of bounds. They do know that they will have Atherton in their ranks in Colombo. Like Sangakkara, Atherton escaped with a 'very severe' reprimand from referee Hanumant Singh for his finger-wagging on Friday night. They do not know whether Hussain will be fit. </p> <p>My guess is that the England captain, who has always relished a good fight, will be there even if it means aggravating his groin injury and jeopardising his presence in the one-day internationals. With melodrama like this who cares about one-day internationals? </p> <p><strong> SRI LANKA - first innings 297; ENGLAND - first innings 387 </strong></p> <p><strong>SRI LANKA - second innings </strong> (overnight 98-6) </p> <p><strong> 6s 4s Mins Balls </strong></p> <p><strong>M S Atapattu</strong> c Stewart b Gough drove at ball wide of off stump <strong> 2 </strong> 0 0 2 4 </p> <p><strong> *S T Jayasuriya</strong> c Thorpe b Caddick bump ball to leaping third slip 00 0 7 1 </p> <p><strong> +K Sangakkara</strong> st Stewart b Croft attempting legside slog <strong> 95</strong> 0 13 257 184 </p> <p><strong> P A de Silva</strong> c White b Gough gloved bouncer to gully <strong> 1</strong> 0 0 5 4 </p> <p><strong> D P M de S Jayawardene</strong> b White cut off spinner onto stumps <strong> 18</strong> 0 3 36 29 </p> <p><strong> R P Arnold</strong> lbw b Croft playing no shot <strong> 22</strong> 0 5 70 48 </p> <p><strong> T M Dilshan</strong> c Hick b Croft edged to slip <strong> 0</strong> 0 0 6 3 </p> <p><strong> H D P K Dharmasena</strong> c Hick b Gough fended bouncer to second slip <strong> 54</strong> 0 8 227 181 </p> <p><strong> W P U C J Vaas</strong> c Croft b White driven to cover <strong> 36</strong> 0 5 112 83 </p> <p><strong> D N T Zoysa</strong> c Hick b Gough low to second slip <strong> 0</strong> 0 0 10 6 </p> <p><strong> M Muralitharan</strong> not out <strong> 6</strong> 1 0 4 3 </p> <p><strong> Extras</strong> (b2,lb3,nb11) <strong> 16 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (373 mins, 89.1 overs) <strong> 250 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> <strong> 1-2</strong> (Atapattu 1st over), <strong> 2-2</strong> (Jayasuriya 2nd), <strong> 3-3</strong> (de Silva 3rd), <strong> 4-42</strong> (Jayawardene 10th), </p> <p><strong> 5-81</strong> (Arnold 25th), <strong> 6-88</strong> (Dilshan 27th), <strong> 7-181</strong> (Sangakkara 62nd), <strong> 8-234</strong> (Dharmasena 87th), <strong> 9-242</strong> (Zoysa 89th), <strong> 10-250</strong> (Vaas 90th). </p> <p><strong> Bowling: Gough</strong> 22-6-50-4 (nb3) (6-0-24-2 7-0-14-0 4-4-0-0 5-2-12-2), </p> <p><strong> Caddick</strong> 18-5-55-1 (nb4) (4-0-19-1 4-2-10-0 6-3-9-0 4-0-17-0), </p> <p><strong> White</strong> 12.1-3-42-2 (nb1) (4-1-11-1 2-1-9-0 2-0-11-0 4-1-11-0 0.1-0-0-1), </p> <p><strong> Croft</strong> 22-11-40-3 (1-1-0-0 4-2-7-2 7-4-12-0 10-4-21-1), </p> <p><strong> Giles</strong> 15-3-58-0 (nb3) (11-3-33-0 3-0-19-0 1-0-6-0). </p> <p><strong> ENGLAND - second innings </strong></p> <p><strong>M A Atherton</strong> c Sangakkara b Vaas low to keeper: ref to 3rd umpire <strong> 11</strong> 0 2 28 18 </p> <p><strong> M E Trescothick</strong> lbw b Vaas working ball to leg <strong> 13</strong> 0 2 33 21 </p> <p><strong> *N Hussain</strong> c Sangakkara b Vaas playing forward to good length ball <strong> 15</strong> 0 1 93 65 </p> <p><strong> G P Thorpe </strong> c Sangakkara b Muralitharan beaten by extra bounce <strong> 46</strong> 0 6 73 58 </p> <p><strong> +A J Stewart</strong> not out <strong> 2</strong> 0 0 24 20 </p> <p><strong> R D B Croft</strong> not out <strong> 1</strong> 0 0 9 6 </p> <p><strong> Extras</strong> (lb1,nb2) <strong> 3</strong> </p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (4 wkts, 132 mins, 31 overs) <strong> 91 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> <strong> 1-24</strong> (Atherton 7th over), <strong> 2-25</strong> (Trescothick 7th), <strong>3-86</strong> (Thorpe 26th), <strong> 4-89</strong> (Hussain 29th). </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> <strong> Vaas</strong> 11-3-18-3 (7-2-13-2 4-1-5-1), </p> <p><strong> Zoysa</strong> 2-0-16-0, <strong> Dharmasena</strong> 6-0-19-0 (one spell each), <strong>Muralitharan</strong> 8-1-28-1 (nb2) (5-0-25-0 3-1-3-1), <strong> Jayasuriya</strong> 4-0-9-0 (one spell). <strong> Umpires:</strong> B C Cooray and R E Koertzen </p> <p><strong> TV replay umpire:</strong> P T Manuel. <strong> Match referee: </strong> Hanumant Singh</p>",

Inevitably BC Cooray was the umpire; inevitably the replays suggested that the ball had hit the bat after the pad. Cooray was at least displaying some consistency, I suppose. Sangakkara played some thrilling strokes: punched drives off the back foot, silky ones off the front. Nor was he afraid to loft the spinners. He gave one chance, a tough caught-and-bowled to Craig White on 89. Only over-exuberance prevented him reaching his century.The England players, whether they like it or not, will be seeing much more of Sangakkara. Odd really: Atherton usually takes to people with brains. After the break England were convinced that Chaminda Vaas was dismissed by Croft, easily the more impressive of the two English spinners. Again it was an appeal for a bat-pad catch to Thorpe; again Cooray was unconvinced. The players reacted sanguinely to the rejection of that appeal; maybe they are getting used to the new rules. There were seven consecutive maidens at the start of that afternoon session but the Sri Lankan innings gradually gained momentum. Vaas began to chance his arm with success, top-edging a hook to the boundary off White; Dharmesena swept Croft for four and England were creaking in several areas. The Sri Lankan tail was looking untroubled and Nasser Hussain tweaked a groin muscle and was compelled to leave the field for a while (Stewart took over). So much hinged on the second new ball, which was taken as soon as it was available. Vaas was soon dropped by Stewart down the leg side off Gough and it took seven overs before the new ball did the trick. Then the indefatigable Gough conjured some steep bounce and Graeme Hick took a fine catch above his head at second slip to end Dharmesena's three-and-three-quarter hours of determined resistance. In Gough's next over, Hick obliged again to dispose of Nuwan Zoysa. Muttiah Muralitharan clubbed one mammoth six over midwicket from Gough's off-cutter but the replacement of Caddick by White finally enabled England to know what their target would be in this match. Vaas hit White's first ball straight to cover. England replied aggressively in pursuit of 161 but both openers were gone by the end of the seventh over. Trescothick with two cuts and Atherton (two cover drives) found the boundary but then Vaas intervened. Atherton is becoming ever more like Boycott - seemingly impregnable except when he is facing subcontinental left-armers. He nicked Vaas to Sangakkara again but stood his ground. There was no doubt that he had touched the ball, but given recent history between these two players there was no way that he was going to leave the field without confirmation that the ball had carried. Cooray wisely consulted the third umpire, who could see that it had. There followed a sterling half-century partnership between a hobbling Hussain and an inspired Thorpe, who threatened to take the game away from the Sri Lankans. Somehow on 17 he survived an lbw appeal against Dharmesena (the umpire was Rudi Koertzen so there did not seem to be so many replays). Otherwise Thorpe's mind was sharp and his touch sure as he resolved to take the initiative. Murali was taken for 20 in his first two overs as Thorpe cut, drove, swept and edged him to the boundary. Hussain occasionally managed a crisp cover drive off Jayasuriya. Yet both were gone by the close. Thorpe was eventually too ambitious against Murali. This time the ball he chose to cut was a little too close to him and it bounced more than he expected. Sangakkara took the catch. Sangakkara was celebrating again within minutes as Vaas returned and won a caught-behind appeal against Hussain. The England captain looked disgruntled, but it is a foolish man who draws too many conclusions from that in this day and age. So it was left to Stewart and the night watchman Croft to take England to the close of a thrilling, sapping day. England could not afford to look ahead any further than the taut session that awaited them on Sunday morning. Even though the final Test at Colombo starts on Thursday that was still out of bounds. They do know that they will have Atherton in their ranks in Colombo. Like Sangakkara, Atherton escaped with a 'very severe' reprimand from referee Hanumant Singh for his finger-wagging on Friday night. They do not know whether Hussain will be fit. My guess is that the England captain, who has always relished a good fight, will be there even if it means aggravating his groin injury and jeopardising his presence in the one-day internationals. With melodrama like this who cares about one-day internationals?

As usual, Umpire BC Cooray was at the centre of most of them and so were Mike Atherton and the young Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batsman, Kumar Sangakkara. </p> <p>The beleaguered Sri Lankan Cooray, who had to endure looking out at banners saying 'Have you got your resident visa for England?' had another poor day. He gave at least two bad decisions against England, adding to earlier howlers against Sri Lanka. </p> <p>Atherton and Sangakkara were summoned to a hearing with match referee Hanumant Singh at the end of play, which was prompted by their heated exchange during Friday's play. Both escaped significant penalties. Singh's statement said: 'Having given careful consideration to the explanations of both players I have decided to issue a very severe reprimand to both players. I am further issuing a final warning to both teams and should there be any repetition of such behaviour, it will be dealt with severely.' </p> <p>Earlier the mistrust that exists between the pair was reflected by Atherton's dismissal. After edging the ball to Sangakkara, Atherton stood his ground and waited until Cooray had consulted the third umpire to check whether the ball had carried. It had. </p> <p>The tension will spill over into this morning. The match, seemingly within England's grasp at the start of play yesterday, was left in the balance after a brilliant innings of 95 by Sangakkara. On a deteriorating pitch England, with six wickets remaining, require another 70 runs for a victory which would square the series. </p> <p>The continued controversy over bad umpiring decisions and players' dissent has prompted former Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga - an Observer Sport columnist for the series - to call for an ICC working party, with powers to push through changes, to examine ways of curtailing the all-seeing, all-hearing influence of television and the pressure it brings to bear on umpires. </p> <p>Ranatunga said: 'I propose an ICC working party - made up of umpires and players who have experience of playing pre-multi-camera and with multi-camera, and with the power to effect change - to examine the problem. With the upcoming world Test championship every contest matters. There is not much time. There is no hiding from Big Brother [television] so he should be stripped of his aura of malevolence and his power used to do good.' </p> <p>Mike Gatting, the former England captain and also an Observer columnist, said: 'It's no coincidence that the worst cases of dissent always occur when there have been several clear miscarriages of justice in the same Test or consecutive matches. This leads to players losing respect for the officials and levels of behaviour soon deteriorate.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "There were more controversies on the fourth day of the tempestuous second Test match between Sri Lanka and England in Kandy yesterday. As usual, Umpire BC Cooray was at the centre of most of them and so were Mike Atherton and the young Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batsman, Kumar Sangakkara. The beleaguered Sri Lankan Cooray, who had to endure looking out at banners saying 'Have you got your resident visa for England?' had another poor day. He gave at least two bad decisions against England, adding to earlier howlers against Sri Lanka. Atherton and Sangakkara were summoned to a hearing with match referee Hanumant Singh at the end of play, which was prompted by their heated exchange during Friday's play. Both escaped significant penalties. Singh's statement said: 'Having given careful consideration to the explanations of both players I have decided to issue a very severe reprimand to both players. I am further issuing a final warning to both teams and should there be any repetition of such behaviour, it will be dealt with severely.' Earlier the mistrust that exists between the pair was reflected by Atherton's dismissal. After edging the ball to Sangakkara, Atherton stood his ground and waited until Cooray had consulted the third umpire to check whether the ball had carried. It had. The tension will spill over into this morning. The match, seemingly within England's grasp at the start of play yesterday, was left in the balance after a brilliant innings of 95 by Sangakkara. On a deteriorating pitch England, with six wickets remaining, require another 70 runs for a victory which would square the series. The continued controversy over bad umpiring decisions and players' dissent has prompted former Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga - an Observer Sport columnist for the series - to call for an ICC working party, with powers to push through changes, to examine ways of curtailing the all-seeing, all-hearing influence of television and the pressure it brings to bear on umpires. Ranatunga said: 'I propose an ICC working party - made up of umpires and players who have experience of playing pre-multi-camera and with multi-camera, and with the power to effect change - to examine the problem. With the upcoming world Test championship every contest matters. There is not much time. There is no hiding from Big Brother [television] so he should be stripped of his aura of malevolence and his power used to do good.' Mike Gatting, the former England captain and also an Observer columnist, said: 'It's no coincidence that the worst cases of dissent always occur when there have been several clear miscarriages of justice in the same Test or consecutive matches. This leads to players losing respect for the officials and levels of behaviour soon deteriorate.'",

There wasn't any of the playing around I'd had in previous relationships, where people are scared to say things. It was all very open and forthright.

To have the entire British state on your back is bad enough, but when the one person who's supporting you then nearly dies, you really are taken apart by it. It was very distressing because Annie was totally delirious and having vivid hallucinations, and before I knew it was meningitis I thought she was losing her mind. </p> <p> There was a feeling that the case had pushed her too far. On the third day, she actually recognised me and smiled at me and there was a tremendous sense of relief. </p> <p><b> Annie Machon:</b> We met at MI5.

I found him physically very attractive and we got on like a house on fire. He's very sparky, very intelligent, very challenging and he makes me laugh, so we had a whale of a time. We knew each other as friends for about a year and gradually fell in love. </p> <p> I was frightened about what would happen when Dave went public. It would completely overthrow our lives. But I love the fact that Dave stands up to the bullies, and if he believes something's right he'll fight for it.

      "body": "<p>Everybody wants a piece of the action. Sex.com, the most sought-after address on the world wide web, is at the centre of a remarkable legal dispute involving a fugitive porn baron, betrayed business partners and billions of pounds in potential profits.</p> <p>Gary Kremen, then a penniless student, bought the rights to the name in 1994, sensing a chance of a big fortune from the burgeoning internet. But as he studied at Stanford University, California, Stephen Cohen, a convicted fraudster, was plotting a coup.</p> <p>Jailed in 1991 for impersonating a lawyer, Cohen heard other convicts tell of money to be made from the net. Sex, he decided, would make him rich.</p> <p>After his release in 1995, he discovered sex.com was registered to Kremen. But he convinced Network Solutions, which controls web addresses, that he was an ex-flatmate of the student, who had agreed to hand it over. Cohen paid \u00a3650 to be listed as the owner.</p> <p>Sex.com was quickly transformed into the hub of a porn empire based in Mexico. Subscriptions to the website grew at the speed of the internet itself. Its nine million users and huge advertising revenues gave Cohen an income of more than $400 million a year, salted away in the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>This weekend Cohen is on the run from US police after ignoring court orders to return sex.com to Kremen and hand over a large slice of his fortune in damages. The flight of the playboy businessman ended a six-year saga over the rights to the web name.</p> <p>Kremen, initially too poor to mount a legal challenge, first filed a lawsuit against Cohen in 1998, using wealth amassed through stock market investments. Expensive teams of lawyers battled it out until a judge ruled last year that the name was not 'property' and could not be 'stolen'. This landmark judgment meant that the most valuable asset a company can have on the internet - its address - was a mere marketing tool.</p> <p>But Kremen persevered. Cohen told a judge he first had the idea for sex.com in 1979, when he advertised 'nudist camps'. Kremen's side reminded the court that dot.coms did not exist then.</p> <p>Last November Kremen had a breakthrough. Judge James Ware said Cohen should return sex.com to Kremen. He ordered that $25 million sent abroad should be returned to the US for possible damages.</p> <p>Cohen ignored the order.

      "bodyText": "Everybody wants a piece of the action. Sex.com, the most sought-after address on the world wide web, is at the centre of a remarkable legal dispute involving a fugitive porn baron, betrayed business partners and billions of pounds in potential profits. Gary Kremen, then a penniless student, bought the rights to the name in 1994, sensing a chance of a big fortune from the burgeoning internet. But as he studied at Stanford University, California, Stephen Cohen, a convicted fraudster, was plotting a coup. Jailed in 1991 for impersonating a lawyer, Cohen heard other convicts tell of money to be made from the net. Sex, he decided, would make him rich. After his release in 1995, he discovered sex.com was registered to Kremen. But he convinced Network Solutions, which controls web addresses, that he was an ex-flatmate of the student, who had agreed to hand it over. Cohen paid \u00a3650 to be listed as the owner. Sex.com was quickly transformed into the hub of a porn empire based in Mexico. Subscriptions to the website grew at the speed of the internet itself. Its nine million users and huge advertising revenues gave Cohen an income of more than $400 million a year, salted away in the British Virgin Islands. This weekend Cohen is on the run from US police after ignoring court orders to return sex.com to Kremen and hand over a large slice of his fortune in damages. The flight of the playboy businessman ended a six-year saga over the rights to the web name. Kremen, initially too poor to mount a legal challenge, first filed a lawsuit against Cohen in 1998, using wealth amassed through stock market investments. Expensive teams of lawyers battled it out until a judge ruled last year that the name was not 'property' and could not be 'stolen'. This landmark judgment meant that the most valuable asset a company can have on the internet - its address - was a mere marketing tool. But Kremen persevered. Cohen told a judge he first had the idea for sex.com in 1979, when he advertised 'nudist camps'. Kremen's side reminded the court that dot.coms did not exist then. Last November Kremen had a breakthrough. Judge James Ware said Cohen should return sex.com to Kremen. He ordered that $25 million sent abroad should be returned to the US for possible damages. Cohen ignored the order. When he also ignored a subsequent contempt-of-court ruling, a warrant for his arrest was issued. He is now thought to be on the run. The businessman may have vanished, but his millions have not. Kremen wants them and he will be helped by a ruling last Friday. It says 'that if you steal a product and sell it, you are competing unfairly,' said Kremen's lawyer, Charles Carreon. Kremen also plans to sue other companies that have registered variants of sex.com, which he now plans to turn into a 'classy' adult entertainment site. nick.walsh@observer.co.uk",

Was it pathetic and ridiculous that during the 1970s I wrote three best selling books on sailing, music and travel, and repeated this record with my autobiography 18 months ago? Was it pathetic and ridiculous that the then Secretary General of the Commonwealth and I played the major part in the production of the Brandt report on International Development in 1981, which produced a better relationship between the developed and developing countries together with more aid in the latter than ever before? Is it pathetic and ridiculous that during this period, I have conducted so many of the world's great orchestras, including the Chicago and Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra, the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Beijing and Shanghai Symphony Orchestras, and the English Chamber Orchestra. I have also recorded CDs of classical works, as well as debating the major issues in the House of Commons and completing my fifty-first continuous year in my constituency of Bexley.

      "body": "<p>The new film by the acclaimed French director Luc Besson was set to be the box-office hit of the French spring. Yamakasi: The Modern-Day Samurai was due to open at 400 cinemas across the country next month. It's an adrenaline-pumped drama about seven tough kids from the Paris suburbs and their streetwise acrobatic skills.</p> <p>But the film's release has been thrown into doubt by a multi-million-pound legal battle. Besson, director of such French blockbusters as Le Grand Bleu, Subway, Nikita, L\u00e9on and Joan of Arc , who also made the Hollywood sci-fi extravaganza The Fifth Element , is being sued by the film's scriptwriters. They want the film banned until they are compensated for Besson's alleged mangling of their work.</p> <p>A Paris court heard last week that Besson had written a 14-page treatment for the film, which he asked the scriptwriters Julien Sri and Philippe Lyon to develop. Sri was also to direct the film. But last summer Besson fired the pair, hired a new director and rewrote the screenplay himself. Sri and Lyon are suing him for breach of copyright, claiming 31 million francs (\u00a330m) damages.</p> <p>Besson's lawyer claimed the scriptwriters' attitude was 'professional suicide'. His production company, Leeloo Productions, says it would be too expensive to halt the release at this late stage, particularly as it was backed by a costly promotional campaign organised around an Easter release date.</p> <p>An attempt to reach a compromise between the two parties has failed, and now judges in Paris are to decide whether to allow the film to open in France on 4 April.</p> <p>The legal battle is a setback for Besson, who has been trying to establish himself as a film producer as well as director. His production efforts, the thrillers Taxi and Taxi 2 , have been huge successes in France if not elsewhere.</p> <p>Yamakasi is the story of a group of seven 'spidermen of the suburbs', who train themselves in a new sport that involves leaping from high-rise apartment blocks before stopping their fall on protruding objects - bungee-jumping without the elastic.</p> <p>The film, which has not yet been shown to the press, is believed to borrow heavily from French bandes dessin\u00e9es (cartoons) and American comic-book superheroes, as well as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan martial arts movies.</p> <p>According to the film's website, each character has special powers. Baseball is good at throwing, L'Araign\u00e9e can climb buildings like Spiderman, La Belette is as slippery as an eel, and so on. In the film, the Yamakasis' high-rise acrobatic skills are copied by young children. But when one child dies after a perilous leap, the Yamakasi are forced to re-evaluate their lifestyles.</p> <p>So far, so tacky. But what, potentially, makes the film interesting is that it is based on an urban sport devised by real-life zonards from the outer Paris suburbs of Evry, Sarcelles and Noisy- le-Grand.</p> <p>The seven Yamakasis claim to have developed an 'art of movement' in response to the alienating conditions of the estates in which they live. Aged between 16 and 26, the young men are from a range of ethnic backgrounds: African, Vietnamese, French, New Caledonian and Italian.</p> <p>'We call ourselves Yama- kasi because that is the word in the Zairean language of Lingala meaning strong spirit, strong body and strong man,' said one of the Yamakasi. 'That's what we're like. We're urban surfers. Just as the surfer tames the waves, we tame the estates'.</p> <p>'Originally we were proficient in martial arts, but that didn't satisfy us. So, for the past seven years, we have developed this art of movement. It consists in adapting oneself to the urban environment and involves training for at least six hours a day.'</p> <p>The Yamakasis - Belle Williams, 17, Belle Chau, 21, N'guba boyeke Guilain, 22, Diouf Malik, 22, Perriere Charles, 23, Piemontesi Laurent, 26, and Hnautra Yann, 26 - argue that their jumping is a philosophy. 'We're trying to invent another way of living on council estates so that we are not alienated from our environment or our bodies.'</p> <p>'Yes, there is a risk in our jumps,' said one Yamakasi. 'But risk helps us to progress. Risk gives us an education in how to live.'</p> <p>Their website gives a breakdown of the jumps they practise - the cat jump, the release, the tic-tac among them. Few involve leaping from high buildings, but all require extraordinary agility.</p> <p>Whether Besson's film is faithful to the real-life Yamakasi remains to be seen, as does the possibility that it will provoke real-life imitators.</p> <p>Filmed last year in a housing development south of Paris, the picture is believed to have young people from the suburbs as extras, while the leading roles were taken by professional actors. It is the latest in a series of feature films about the dysfunctional lives of young people in the troubled high-rise estates that ring Paris. The trend started in 1995 with Mathieu Kassovitz's film La Haine (Hate), about three kids from the suburbs on a fateful spree in the capital. Last year La Squale (meaning a girl tearaway), directed by a former secondary school teacher who was alarmed at what he had witnessed in Sarcelles, recounted the barbaric abuse of young girls in the suburbs.</p> <p>Besson's film is expected to have a more positive message from the suburbs, blighted recently by a spate of teenage gang killings.</p> <p>His current court dispute is the latest in a career pitted with legal wrangles.</p>",

Yamakasi: The Modern-Day Samurai was due to open at 400 cinemas across the country next month. It's an adrenaline-pumped drama about seven tough kids from the Paris suburbs and their streetwise acrobatic skills. But the film's release has been thrown into doubt by a multi-million-pound legal battle. Besson, director of such French blockbusters as Le Grand Bleu, Subway, Nikita, L\u00e9on and Joan of Arc , who also made the Hollywood sci-fi extravaganza The Fifth Element , is being sued by the film's scriptwriters. They want the film banned until they are compensated for Besson's alleged mangling of their work. A Paris court heard last week that Besson had written a 14-page treatment for the film, which he asked the scriptwriters Julien Sri and Philippe Lyon to develop. Sri was also to direct the film. But last summer Besson fired the pair, hired a new director and rewrote the screenplay himself. Sri and Lyon are suing him for breach of copyright, claiming 31 million francs (\u00a330m) damages. Besson's lawyer claimed the scriptwriters' attitude was 'professional suicide'. His production company, Leeloo Productions, says it would be too expensive to halt the release at this late stage, particularly as it was backed by a costly promotional campaign organised around an Easter release date. An attempt to reach a compromise between the two parties has failed, and now judges in Paris are to decide whether to allow the film to open in France on 4 April. The legal battle is a setback for Besson, who has been trying to establish himself as a film producer as well as director. His production efforts, the thrillers Taxi and Taxi 2 , have been huge successes in France if not elsewhere. Yamakasi is the story of a group of seven 'spidermen of the suburbs', who train themselves in a new sport that involves leaping from high-rise apartment blocks before stopping their fall on protruding objects - bungee-jumping without the elastic. The film, which has not yet been shown to the press, is believed to borrow heavily from French bandes dessin\u00e9es (cartoons) and American comic-book superheroes, as well as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan martial arts movies. According to the film's website, each character has special powers. Baseball is good at throwing, L'Araign\u00e9e can climb buildings like Spiderman, La Belette is as slippery as an eel, and so on. In the film, the Yamakasis' high-rise acrobatic skills are copied by young children. But when one child dies after a perilous leap, the Yamakasi are forced to re-evaluate their lifestyles. So far, so tacky. But what, potentially, makes the film interesting is that it is based on an urban sport devised by real-life zonards from the outer Paris suburbs of Evry, Sarcelles and Noisy- le-Grand. The seven Yamakasis claim to have developed an 'art of movement' in response to the alienating conditions of the estates in which they live. Aged between 16 and 26, the young men are from a range of ethnic backgrounds: African, Vietnamese, French, New Caledonian and Italian. 'We call ourselves Yama- kasi because that is the word in the Zairean language of Lingala meaning strong spirit, strong body and strong man,' said one of the Yamakasi. 'That's what we're like. We're urban surfers. Just as the surfer tames the waves, we tame the estates'. 'Originally we were proficient in martial arts, but that didn't satisfy us. So, for the past seven years, we have developed this art of movement. It consists in adapting oneself to the urban environment and involves training for at least six hours a day.' The Yamakasis - Belle Williams, 17, Belle Chau, 21, N'guba boyeke Guilain, 22, Diouf Malik, 22, Perriere Charles, 23, Piemontesi Laurent, 26, and Hnautra Yann, 26 - argue that their jumping is a philosophy. 'We're trying to invent another way of living on council estates so that we are not alienated from our environment or our bodies.' 'Yes, there is a risk in our jumps,' said one Yamakasi. 'But risk helps us to progress. Risk gives us an education in how to live.' Their website gives a breakdown of the jumps they practise - the cat jump, the release, the tic-tac among them. Few involve leaping from high buildings, but all require extraordinary agility. Whether Besson's film is faithful to the real-life Yamakasi remains to be seen, as does the possibility that it will provoke real-life imitators. Filmed last year in a housing development south of Paris, the picture is believed to have young people from the suburbs as extras, while the leading roles were taken by professional actors. It is the latest in a series of feature films about the dysfunctional lives of young people in the troubled high-rise estates that ring Paris. The trend started in 1995 with Mathieu Kassovitz's film La Haine (Hate), about three kids from the suburbs on a fateful spree in the capital. Last year La Squale (meaning a girl tearaway), directed by a former secondary school teacher who was alarmed at what he had witnessed in Sarcelles, recounted the barbaric abuse of young girls in the suburbs. Besson's film is expected to have a more positive message from the suburbs, blighted recently by a spate of teenage gang killings. His current court dispute is the latest in a career pitted with legal wrangles.",

Many on the Left hope today's vote will be the first steps to electing a socialist to the Elys\u00e9e Palace next year. In the latest opinion polls, Jospin has a 2 per cent lead over Chirac. Pollsters are less certain. Philippe Mechet, director general of market research agency SOFRES, said Chirac's personal charisma may be a significant factor. 'The President of the Republic is our king, we need to have a symbolic and representative figure,' said Mechet. 'Jacques Chirac has kept himself away from the Right's divisions and still has a good image. If the elections were to take place tomorrow, Jospin would win. In a year, I don't know.'

      "body": "<p>Nikki Allan, aged seven, vanished on 7 October, 1992. Her body was found the following day near her home in Sunderland. She had been stabbed 37 times. A neighbour, George Heron, 22, was arrested and charged with murder but was cleared after the judge ruled his confession had been obtained under duress. The police maintained Heron knew details of the killing to which only the murderer could be privy.</p> <p>Sharon Prest, the mother of Nikki, subsequently brought a civil case and was awarded damages. If proposals put forward by the Law Commission last Tuesday become law, then Heron and up to 10 others acquitted of child murders may find themselves facing a second trial for the crime for which they originally walked free.</p> <p>A review of the rule of double jeopardy, which states that no one who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence can be tried a second time on the same facts, was recommended by Sir William Macpherson after the inquiry into Stephen Lawrence's death. He suggested: 'Perhaps in modern times such absolute protection may sometimes lead to injustice.'</p> <p>The Law Commission has now recommended that, in murder cases only, double jeopardy should be set aside when there is fresh and 'compelling' evidence; when a judge has ruled crucial evidence inadmissible, making it impossible for the Crown to proceed; and when there has been a 'tainted acquittal' as a result of the intimidation of witnesses or jurors.</p> <p>The change should be retrospective. In theory, this could allow the retrial of three of the five suspects in the Stephen Lawrence kill-ing. According to the National Crime Faculty, there are at least 35 other murder investigations which have led to an acquittal and in which fresh forensic evidence could justify a second trial.</p> <p>In addition, fresh forensic evidence may also lead to the retrial of 10 child murderers whose details are on the 'Catchem' national database run by Detective Inspector Chuck Burton of Derbyshire Police. Catchem is an acronym which stands for the Centralised Analytical Team Collating Homicide Expertise and Management.</p> <p>Catchem records a mass of details from 40 years of child homicide. It was established in 1986 as part of the national police effort to catch Robert Black, eventually given 10 life sentences in 1994 for the deaths of three young girls. Detective Inspector Burton says he is 'optimistic' that, on the strength of new forensic evidence, second trials may prove successful. 'What can be more galling,' he asks, 'than to know that a guilty man remains free?'</p> <p>New procedures now used by the Forensic Science Services, among them advances in DNA, corneal images and ear prints, provide the most telling arguments for change. Objections have come from, among others, the Criminal Bar Association, the Law Society and Liberty, the civil rights organisation. They argue a second chance may encourage police incompetence; juries could be influenced by an appeal court's ordering a second trial; and 'foolproof' DNA evidence has already figured in a number of miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>John Wadham, director of Liberty, points out there have been 85 acts of parliament in the past 20 years, each eroding the rights of the individual. 'Everyone assumes this is about convicting guilty people - but what if the individual is innocent?'</p> <p>Those in favour of the Law Commission's recommendations argue that public confidence is just as surely shaken by a system that repeatedly fails to bring offenders to justice as it is by the spectacle of innocent people being released from jail for wrongful convictions.</p> <p>The secondary victims of crime, the families of those murdered who, at times, encounter mediocre police investigations, the abysmal standards of the Crown Prosecution Service and the inexplicable rulings of some judges, believe that to set aside the double jeopardy rule would provide the first clear sign that they were no longer battling alone.</p> <p>In 1989, Ann Ming's daughter, Julie Hogg, aged 23, worked as a pizza delivery girl in Billingham, Stockton on Tees. Mother and daughter were close. On 16 November, 1989, Julie went missing. Her mother said: 'Her disappearance was totally, totally, out of character.'</p> <p>A forensic team spent five days unsuccessfully examining Julie's house. It remained locked up for three months. In February 1990, Julie's husband, Andrew, returned and detected a strange smell in the bathroom. Ann went to investigate. She accidentally dislodged a panel on the side of the bath and saw the body of her daughter.</p> <p>'Since then, we've had to battle every step of the way on our own,' she said last week. 'The Law Commission has given us our first glimmer of hope. If we can see my daughter's killer finally convicted then, 11 years after her death, we will finally have closure on a living nightmare.'</p> <p>BIlly Dunlop, an acquaintance of Julie, was put on trial in 1991 and pleaded not guilty to murder. Julie's house keys with Dunlop's fingerprints were found in his lodging house; the blanket around her body revealed fibres from Dunlop's jumper, semen stains and strands of hair. Cause of death could not be established because the body was so decomposed.</p> <p>A second trial was ordered because the first jury failed to agree. On the second occa sion, the judge allowed the jury only five hours to reach a unanimous or majority verdict. When they failed, Dunlop was acquitted.</p> <p>In 1998 Dunlop was given a seven-year sentence for grievous bodily harm after attacking a couple with a knife and a baseball bat. In Moreland Prison, he befriended a woman prison officer and in over 60 hours of taped conversation explained how he had strangled Julie Hogg and mutilated her body. He was subsequently convicted on two counts of perjury and given two six-year sentences to run concurrently. In passing sentence, the judge said he was unable to take into consideration Dunlop's danger to the public or the murder of Julie Hogg.</p> <p>Dunlop begins serving the perjury sentence in 2003, after completing his existing sentence. In the meantime, the Mings have applied to change the cause of death on their daughter's death certificate from 'not ascertainable' to 'strangulation'.</p> <p>Lawyers have told them that, under the Human Rights Act, they have to request Dunlop's permission before the change can be made. 'Billy Dunlop symbolises how easy it is to make a mockery of the British justice system,' said Mrs Ming. 'I want him convicted for the murder of my daughter and then I begin again.'</p> <p>She has given up her job as a nurse and suffers from post- traumatic stress disorder. A survey last year by the charity Victim's Voice of 114 families affected by murder, revealed that 48 per cent of family members had suffered physical or mental ill health; one in three had lost a job and 31 per cent had experienced family breakdown. Trauma is even more acute when individuals are seen as literally getting away with murder.</p> <p>In 1908, Tony Allis bought Beechwood Cottage, near King's Stanley in Gloucestershire. The cottage had no access for vehicles. Alliss asked his neighbour, Terence Maule, if he could pay for right of way across his land. Maule refused. Eventually Alliss acquired right of way through a wood, Penn Wood, in return for general maintenance.</p> <p>In 1990, Tony Alliss and a friend bought the wood, guaranteeing Alliss right of way. Several times in the months up to July of that year, Terence Maule tried to claim some of the wood, erecting a fence. Alliss's solicitor requested that the fence should be taken down. Maule did nothing, claiming the boundary had existed for 20 years. Alliss took the fence down, Maule put it back again.</p> <p>Maule alleged Alliss had attacked him once. Alliss, in turn, made two complaints to police that Maule had fired a shotgun over his head. On the the evening of 26 July, 1990, ambulance men were called to the wood. They found Tony Alliss dying from two gunshot wounds. As they attended to him, another shot was fired. The ambulance men ran for cover. Armed police surrounded Sandpit Farm, home of Terence Maule and his 19-year-old son, Graig. Graig surrendered after a three-and-a-half hour siege.</p> <p>In interviews read out in Bristol Crown Court, at the Maules' murder trial in June 1991, they said they had come across Alliss dismantling the fence. They had taken guns for their protection. Alliss, unarmed, had allegedly grabbed a gun and struggled with Terence Maule. Graig Maule, in defence of his father, had accidentally hit Alliss. Terence Maule called for an ambulance. The Maules alleged that Alliss's 14-year-old son Leigh, who had gone to discover the cause of the shot, had been accidentally wounded 20 minutes later.</p> <p>Mr Justice Schiemann stopped the trial at the end of the prosecution evidence, ordering the jury to acquit. He ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove an agreement to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. He went on to praise how Graig Maule had acted 'in the circumstances', saying his father could be 'proud of him'. Graig Maule pleaded guilty to possessing a shotgun without a certificate, and his father guilty to aiding and abetting his son in the possession. They were given absolute discharges and the guns were confiscated.</p> <p>Bob Alliss said his brother had taken down the fence on his own land only to be confronted with the Maules, both armed with shotguns. Leigh had been injured by the same gun that had killed his father. Leigh said: 'I heard a voice that sounded like Graig Maule's, saying 'Leigh', then I was shot.'</p> <p>Seven weeks after the trial, the Maules were fined \u00a350 for trespass and ordered to pay \u00a3500 for damage to trees on land they had claimed they had owned for 20 years. An injunction was also imposed upon them to prevent them from going back into the woods.</p> <p>In 1993, Tony Alliss's widow, Joyce Alliss, was awarded \u00a3150,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. It decided that Tony Alliss had died unlawfully: 'His conduct in no way contributed to the incident or to his death.'</p> <p>In November, Leigh Alliss begins a civil case against the Maules that, crucially, will introduce fresh ballistic forensic evidence questioning whether Tony's wounds could have been received in a fight. Hannah Rutterford, Leigh Alliss's solicitor, said: 'The judge refused details of the boundary dispute to be heard on the grounds that it didn't matter. We think it's very relevant indeed.</p> <p>'Tony Alliss was also portrayed as a big, intimidating person when we have witnesses who give a very different view. Until the double jeopardy rule is set aside, this is the only way the Allisses can obtain a fair trial and an opportunity for the evidence of the other side to be properly scrutinised.' Bob Alliss, a builder, has been unable to work for nine years. 'I shall pursue this case until my dying breath,' he said.</p> <p>'I know you can't bring back the dead, but my brother was unarmed. He was shot on his own land from both barrels of an unlicensed shotgun. I cannot believe that there's nothing in law that says that's wrong.'</p> <p>Paul Boateng, Home Office Minister, has pointed out that the Criminal Cases Review Commission considers miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>'In contrast, if a victim believes there has been a wrongful acquittal, there is no mechanism for correcting that miscarriage... and no right of appeal against judicial decisions that lead to a termination of proceedings.'</p> <p>Kent's Chief Constable, David Phillips, chairman of the crime committee of the Association of Chief Constables, told the House of Commons home affairs committee reporting on the double jeopardy ruling: 'I am always suspicious of lofty principles that we are encouraged to believe should stand alone.</p> <p>'In most of these questions there are competing principles. One is the notion that in general there should be finality to prosecutions and the other is that there is real interest in justice.'</p>",

Alliss, unarmed, had allegedly grabbed a gun and struggled with Terence Maule. Graig Maule, in defence of his father, had accidentally hit Alliss. Terence Maule called for an ambulance. The Maules alleged that Alliss's 14-year-old son Leigh, who had gone to discover the cause of the shot, had been accidentally wounded 20 minutes later. Mr Justice Schiemann stopped the trial at the end of the prosecution evidence, ordering the jury to acquit. He ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove an agreement to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. He went on to praise how Graig Maule had acted 'in the circumstances', saying his father could be 'proud of him'. Graig Maule pleaded guilty to possessing a shotgun without a certificate, and his father guilty to aiding and abetting his son in the possession. They were given absolute discharges and the guns were confiscated. Bob Alliss said his brother had taken down the fence on his own land only to be confronted with the Maules, both armed with shotguns. Leigh had been injured by the same gun that had killed his father. Leigh said: 'I heard a voice that sounded like Graig Maule's, saying 'Leigh', then I was shot.' Seven weeks after the trial, the Maules were fined \u00a350 for trespass and ordered to pay \u00a3500 for damage to trees on land they had claimed they had owned for 20 years. An injunction was also imposed upon them to prevent them from going back into the woods. In 1993, Tony Alliss's widow, Joyce Alliss, was awarded \u00a3150,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. It decided that Tony Alliss had died unlawfully: 'His conduct in no way contributed to the incident or to his death.' In November, Leigh Alliss begins a civil case against the Maules that, crucially, will introduce fresh ballistic forensic evidence questioning whether Tony's wounds could have been received in a fight. Hannah Rutterford, Leigh Alliss's solicitor, said: 'The judge refused details of the boundary dispute to be heard on the grounds that it didn't matter. We think it's very relevant indeed. 'Tony Alliss was also portrayed as a big, intimidating person when we have witnesses who give a very different view. Until the double jeopardy rule is set aside, this is the only way the Allisses can obtain a fair trial and an opportunity for the evidence of the other side to be properly scrutinised.' Bob Alliss, a builder, has been unable to work for nine years. 'I shall pursue this case until my dying breath,' he said. 'I know you can't bring back the dead, but my brother was unarmed. He was shot on his own land from both barrels of an unlicensed shotgun. I cannot believe that there's nothing in law that says that's wrong.' Paul Boateng, Home Office Minister, has pointed out that the Criminal Cases Review Commission considers miscarriages of justice. 'In contrast, if a victim believes there has been a wrongful acquittal, there is no mechanism for correcting that miscarriage... and no right of appeal against judicial decisions that lead to a termination of proceedings.' Kent's Chief Constable, David Phillips, chairman of the crime committee of the Association of Chief Constables, told the House of Commons home affairs committee reporting on the double jeopardy ruling: 'I am always suspicious of lofty principles that we are encouraged to believe should stand alone. 'In most of these questions there are competing principles. One is the notion that in general there should be finality to prosecutions and the other is that there is real interest in justice.'",

      "bodyText": "Some of the world's top companies and advertising agencies have joined forces to clean prime-time American television of what they see as gratuitous sex and violence, promoting instead a return to 'family viewing'. A mighty coalition, the 'Family Friendly Programming Forum', including Coca-Cola, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, General Motors, Ford, Kellogg, Nestl\u00e9 and McDonald's, plans to use the muscle its $12 billion-worth of advertising buys to nurture programmes during a sacrosanct 'family hour' between 8 and 9pm. The aim is to use their clout with the networks to develop a 'template' for what one of the biggest names in US advertising, Bill Cella of Universal McCann, calls 'television the whole family can watch together, without people having to explain to their kids what an orgasm is'. Cella and leading executives from companies that make up the forum are discussing with three of the networks (a fourth is in the wings) the next autumn schedules, and their message is clear: if scripts stray too far from the forum's 'mission statement' on quality and content, their shows may not get the advertising they need. 'This is not right-wing proselytising,' says Cella, who handles $3 billion-worth of corporate television advertising a year, 'this is meeting a need'. The forum has established a body to commission and develop scripts for 'family-friendly' programmes to present to the networks, set up a scholarship scheme in Hollywood encouraging scriptwriters to deliver quality family programmes, and launched a televised award ceremony for 'family' programmes. One of the shows propelled by the forum is already established during prime time: The Gilmore Girls , about a one-time teenaged mother who has struggled to raise her daughter. The show holds its own against Survivors and Friends which has become a particular target of the forum's crusade. Its poster-boy star Matthew Perry was plastered across the cover of People magazine after his admission to a detoxification clinic, leaving the programme struggling to complete filming its latest run. 'It simply is not an eight o'clock show,' says Cella. 'It's a successful show and a great show, but it's not for kids. They talk about sex and orgasms - how are you supposed to explain that to your seven-year-old?' Another series singled out by Cella is the Boston Public show 'in which you see some guy firing off a gun in school; which is happening in real life' - during a week that saw in California and Pennsylvania two more in America's grim series of school shootings. The forum was co-founded by a captain of American industry - Proctor &amp; Gamble's Bob Wehling - in 1998, since when it has grown to represent 43 of the world's biggest companies. Wehling recalls how he 'raised six girls during the period when television went steadily from good family programming to shows that you had to think twice about sponsoring'. By the end of the 1990s, he says, the company found itself with 'fewer and fewer options' of programmes during which to advertise that were not in breach of 'guidelines we had drawn up in the 1950s, which would not surprise you, on gratuitous sex, violence, mockery of the clergy and racial groups' and other offensive content. Wehling joined Andrea Alstrup, vice-president of Johnson &amp; Johnson, who made a speech launching the forum at a gathering of advertising executives in New York, quoted in Brill's Content magazine: 'Do we really need to continue to support with our advertising,' she said, 'a constant barrage of media that appeals to the lowest common denominators of values?

With a single statue worth up to \u00a350,000, the trade is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds each year. London is one of the key centres for the sale of works illicitly excavated in the war-torn state. Investigators believe there is a 'loose network' of dealers who keep a low profile and, working from home, sell to collectors all over the world. 'You can have deals worth thousands and thousands taking place in someone's front room,' said Charles Hill, an art risk consultant and former head of Scotland Yard's arts and antiquities squad.

Major auction houses and dealers are careful to avoid smuggled or illegally excavated material, forcing the trade underground, Hill said. Interest in early Afghan art has been boosted by the attempt by the Taliban, the Islamic militia which rules Afghanistan, to destroy thousands of statues, including two 150ft Buddhas carved into a mountain in Bamiyan.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nowhere, among the reams of outraged copy and uninformed rhetoric blaming the umpires for England's defeat in the first Test in Sri Lanka, have I read any informed comment either on why or how such a predictable situation arose, or what immediate, practical steps need to be taken to prevent a recurrence. </p> <p>It says much about the depth of cricket journalism that the only 'solutions' proffered by the press pundits and television commentary teams - none of whom is, or include, a trained, qualified umpire - are the quick-fix installation of more sophisticated camera technology to undermine still further the authority of the umpires, and the regressive concept that Test umpires should be selected only from a small, elite panel. This short-term approach is not the solution to a very serious problem. </p> <p>That both umpires in Galle were inexperienced at Test level cannot be denied; that both umpires, as their trial by repeated video replay and long-range lens showed, made mistakes under pressure cannot be denied. But is it fair that they alone should be pilloried? </p> <p>Cynically - and, I suspect, with a tacit nod and a wink from their respective managements - England and Sri Lanka players sought to exploit the umpires' inexperience by increasing the pressure on them through persistent, inappropriate, intimidatory appealing and aggressive body language. Such behaviour, an exported Australian art form, is euphemistically described or justified as 'playing the percentages; playing it hard, being competitive'. What pseudo-macho rubbish! Quite apart from being contrary to the principles set down in the 'Spirit of the Game', now enshrined in the new Laws 2000 Code which came into effect on 1 October last year, it is cheating, pure and simple. </p> <p>What none of the great and the good, who make up the fraternal band of 'expert' cricket journalists and celebrity ex-player commentators, appears to have cottoned on to is that poor standards of umpiring are the direct result of a perpetual failure by cricket's governing bodies to address the underlying, fundamental problem - that cricket is the only professional sport which does not require its officials to be formally trained, qualified, regularly re-assessed, or graded. </p> <p>Evaluation of the competence of umpires is carried out by getting the respective team captains to complete a confidential ICC/ECB Report Form which invites them to tick one of the optional Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory or Poor boxes alongside such questions, for example, as 'Quality of LBW decisions'; 'Quality of Caught Bad-Pad decisions'; 'Knowledge of the Laws'; and 'Players' respect for Umpire'. </p> <p>A captain, possibly fielding at mid-off, who was given out lbw on the first ball he received in his team's innings - and who has, at best, like many journalists, only a peripheral knowledge of the laws and almost certainly little understanding of their interpretation and application - is in a position effectively to determine an umpire's future. This reinforces the urgent need for the ICC to introduce a more professional, objective, competence-based assessment process. </p> <p>In conducting their post-mortem of the first Test, the first priority of the ICC must be to examine who assessed, who selected, and who appointed the umpires and the subjective or objective criteria upon which the selections were based. </p> <p>Their present method of evaluation is subjective, unconstructive and of only limited value in determining the true level of an umpire's competence. Against this background, one can understand why two relatively inexperienced, ungraded umpires whom the ICC appointed to control such a potentially volatile Test made mistakes. </p> <p>The media have called for umpires in Tests to be restricted to the same panel of familiar faces - and for referees, or third umpires, to have mandatory authority to intervene in, or overturn, decisions without first being requested by the umpire. But simultaneously, the media have demanded the immediate introduction of more sophisticated, expensive technology to obviate the need for umpires to make decisions. This, frankly, is an absurd juxtaposition. </p> <p>For a start, the referee or third umpire is likely to be as untrained and unqualified as his colleagues in the middle. Take, for example, the 26 umpires on the ECB First Class List; the preserve, with one or two rare exceptions, of former first-class players whose playing careers at that level have, hitherto, been accepted as an appropriate 'qualification' for them to stand as first-class umpires.

      "bodyText": "Nowhere, among the reams of outraged copy and uninformed rhetoric blaming the umpires for England's defeat in the first Test in Sri Lanka, have I read any informed comment either on why or how such a predictable situation arose, or what immediate, practical steps need to be taken to prevent a recurrence. It says much about the depth of cricket journalism that the only 'solutions' proffered by the press pundits and television commentary teams - none of whom is, or include, a trained, qualified umpire - are the quick-fix installation of more sophisticated camera technology to undermine still further the authority of the umpires, and the regressive concept that Test umpires should be selected only from a small, elite panel. This short-term approach is not the solution to a very serious problem. That both umpires in Galle were inexperienced at Test level cannot be denied; that both umpires, as their trial by repeated video replay and long-range lens showed, made mistakes under pressure cannot be denied. But is it fair that they alone should be pilloried? Cynically - and, I suspect, with a tacit nod and a wink from their respective managements - England and Sri Lanka players sought to exploit the umpires' inexperience by increasing the pressure on them through persistent, inappropriate, intimidatory appealing and aggressive body language. Such behaviour, an exported Australian art form, is euphemistically described or justified as 'playing the percentages; playing it hard, being competitive'. What pseudo-macho rubbish! Quite apart from being contrary to the principles set down in the 'Spirit of the Game', now enshrined in the new Laws 2000 Code which came into effect on 1 October last year, it is cheating, pure and simple. What none of the great and the good, who make up the fraternal band of 'expert' cricket journalists and celebrity ex-player commentators, appears to have cottoned on to is that poor standards of umpiring are the direct result of a perpetual failure by cricket's governing bodies to address the underlying, fundamental problem - that cricket is the only professional sport which does not require its officials to be formally trained, qualified, regularly re-assessed, or graded. Evaluation of the competence of umpires is carried out by getting the respective team captains to complete a confidential ICC/ECB Report Form which invites them to tick one of the optional Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory or Poor boxes alongside such questions, for example, as 'Quality of LBW decisions'; 'Quality of Caught Bad-Pad decisions'; 'Knowledge of the Laws'; and 'Players' respect for Umpire'. A captain, possibly fielding at mid-off, who was given out lbw on the first ball he received in his team's innings - and who has, at best, like many journalists, only a peripheral knowledge of the laws and almost certainly little understanding of their interpretation and application - is in a position effectively to determine an umpire's future. This reinforces the urgent need for the ICC to introduce a more professional, objective, competence-based assessment process. In conducting their post-mortem of the first Test, the first priority of the ICC must be to examine who assessed, who selected, and who appointed the umpires and the subjective or objective criteria upon which the selections were based. Their present method of evaluation is subjective, unconstructive and of only limited value in determining the true level of an umpire's competence. Against this background, one can understand why two relatively inexperienced, ungraded umpires whom the ICC appointed to control such a potentially volatile Test made mistakes. The media have called for umpires in Tests to be restricted to the same panel of familiar faces - and for referees, or third umpires, to have mandatory authority to intervene in, or overturn, decisions without first being requested by the umpire. But simultaneously, the media have demanded the immediate introduction of more sophisticated, expensive technology to obviate the need for umpires to make decisions. This, frankly, is an absurd juxtaposition. For a start, the referee or third umpire is likely to be as untrained and unqualified as his colleagues in the middle. Take, for example, the 26 umpires on the ECB First Class List; the preserve, with one or two rare exceptions, of former first-class players whose playing careers at that level have, hitherto, been accepted as an appropriate 'qualification' for them to stand as first-class umpires. Of these, only around five or six have attended multi-level, formal training and/or advanced refresher courses, taken formal qualifying (written and oral) examinations and undergone formal assessments by their peers - i.e. have made the commitment to be trained to become qualified. The ICC select from the ECB First Class List for their international panel. The most regrettable aspect of this Sri Lankan controversy is that to a trained umpire, LBW is not a difficult decision, yet cricket fans watching the Galle Test must have thought: 'If they can't get it right at this level, what must the rest be like?' The answer is that many of the 'rest' are far better qualified and more deserving of appointment to the highest levels. This arcane system needs reform; it is an anachronism in today's cricket. Players, at ALL levels, from schools to Leagues to County to national representative sides, deserve and have a right to expect the highest possible standards of umpiring. To achieve this, we need to recruit many more, younger, umpires. In order to encourage them we, the ECB, ICC, ACU&amp;S and the present First Class List Umpires, need to demonstrate our active joint collaboration in providing a genuinely open, merit-based, seamless 'career' development path from the national recreational game through to the highest international professional levels. The details of how this could be structured and administered are the subject of a separate ACU&amp;S Paper. It is very much to the credit of the ECB that, recognising the problem, they have recently introduced a requirement that all future prospective candidates for the First Class Reserve List must attend customised ACU&amp;S Training Courses and pass the subsequent examinations. These are carefully structured modular courses which teach candidates not only the Laws and how to interpret and apply them under pressure, but also, more important, the twin arts of fieldcraft and communication; man-management; awareness; and how to prevent/control gamesmanship and controversy on the field. Later courses will train umpires how and when they should opt to utilise technology before responding to answering appeals. The ACU&amp;S have a wealth of very experienced, trained umpires within their ranks who stand regularly in senior Premier Leagues, Minor Counties and County Second XI matches throughout the UK and would make excellent First Class List umpires, but who are denied an invitation by the ECB and ICC to progress to the very highest levels. By failing to recognise and proactively exploit this pool of younger, active umpiring talent, the ECB and ICC are, I believe, doing themselves, the players and cricket a grave disservice. With 119 revisions/amendments to the Laws - including some major changes - and additional signals, which came into effect on 1 October last year, professional training, competence-based assessment and grading of umpires are a matter of paramount importance. So what is the solution? The answer is a phased solution: first, the ICC must immediately give the issue of umpire development a much higher priority. Second, they must budget to set aside an appropriate annual amount (the ACU&amp;S can advise how much) from their newly acquired kitty of \u00a3150 million specifically for: the appointment of a Director of Umpires whose remit and authority would cover all aspects of international umpire training (including mandatory bi-annual refresher courses to retain grade level); selection procedures (including mandatory minimum fitness, eyesight and hearing requirements); progression, monitoring and assessment, and appointments in the professional game. There must be collaboration with ACU&amp;S and other umpire associations, in the creation of regional, national and international 'pools' of highly mobile, qualified Instructor Umpires and experienced Field Assessors. There must be the creation and maintenance of an international 'CV' database of all the current and prospective qualified, graded First Class, International/Test Panel Umpires to provide objective assessment records. We must also have the joint-venture creation, with MCC, national governing bodies, ACU&amp;S and other umpire organisations, of a new international body - e.g. the International Council of Cricket Umpires (ICCU) - as the recognised technical forum for setting, developing and monitoring international consistency in the standards of umpire training, and evaluation programmes, fieldcraft, Grade Levels, fee structures and the type and application of support technology. Phased in over the next three years, these investment initiatives will provide far greater and more lasting benefits for the ICC (in particular) and cricket (in general) than the media-peddled siren calls to sink everything into sophisticated and equally fallible new, software-based camera/capture technology which does nothing to solve the underlying problem and will only undermine still further the authority of umpires.",

      "bodyText": "Rank officiating is not the exclusive preserve of Sri Lankan cricket umpires after all. While not quite on the scale of the events unfolding in our other national sport, Roy Pearson's unimpressive efforts here could prove to have a major impact on the First Division promotion race. Nottingham Forest's crucial win was set in motion after only three minutes. It was shrouded in controversy as David Johnson's apparently illegal throw-in led to defender Christian Edwards heading in via the despairing grasp of Simon Tracey. Johnson backed up to the advertising hoardings, where he began his run-up for a throw-in five yards from the right corner flag. Gathering pace, he threw the ball deep into the Blades' area, appearing to have one foot off the ground and to stray a few inches over the line when he released the ball. Certainly that was how United manager Neil Warnock saw the incident, and how he repeatedly re-enacted it for the linesman, the fourth official, Forest players and main stand spectators. An engaging and, dare one say, borderline eccentric character, Warnock's impression was something of which John Cleese could have been proud. But this was no laughing matter in a clash between two teams competing for that precious final play-off position. 'David Platt had a moan at the ref afterwards, but I told him not to moan at him because he had done well for him,' said Warnock. 'The first goal was allowed to stand even though David Johnson was two feet on the pitch when he took the throw-in. 'When I told the referee about it, he said his decision was final and then proceeded to blame the linesman. I even asked the fourth official but he said he could only get involved in serious foul play.' Warnock hinted that Andy Johnson's eighth-minute challenge on George Santos, an incident that left the United midfielder with a double fracture to his cheekbone, qualified as such, but again the officials took no action. Forest, too, felt they were the victims of a questionable decision when Tony Vaughan was ruled to have handled Paul Devlin's cross five minutes after Andy Johnson had shot Forest into a 64th-minute 2-0 lead, scoring from eight yards after Stern John headed a Chris Bart-Williams corner across the face of goal. Justice, from Forest's viewpoint, was served when Bobby Ford's spot-kick clipped the bar and flew over, a miss made all the more frustrating three minutes later when Shaun Murphy's stooping header from Rob Kozluk's cross pulled them to within a goal. The game had, however, hinged more on a long string of wasted half-chances and ill-used possession by the home team. David Johnson was to conclude the day's events in the same way as he had started them, this time taking, rather than making, a goal three minutes from time. Forest midfielder David Prutton skilfully reached the goalline and pulled the ball back for Johnson to score at the second attempt.",

You know, the 25-year-old striker born in Belfast and brought up in Ghana, who numbers Cumbernauld United, Motherwell and East Fife among his previous clubs. And to prove that the Cup's capacity to throw up the most outrageous of stories lives on, Essandoh was signed 10 days ago, after Sanchez had advertised on Teletext that he needed strikers to cover an injury crisis. He was the only one to respond. </p> <p>Seizing the moment and the day, substitute Essandoh, latterly with VPS Vaasa in Finland, popped up in the second minute of added time to head Second Division Wanderers into the semi-finals - just think about it; a non-League club only eight years ago in the last four of the FA Cup - to cap a frantic finale that saw Wycombe denied a clear penalty, Sanchez banished from the touchline for his protestations and the inspirational Steve Brown ridiculously sent off for celebrating the winning goal by removing his shirt. </p> <p>It was deserved; it was certainly almost impossible to tell which was sixth and which sixtieth in English football's pecking order. Leicester had their moments but they always looked uncomfortable now they were no longer underdogs and forced to take the game to their opponents. Wycombe's game plan worked perfectly, mirroring Leicester's 3-5-2, tackling tenaciously and breaking out swiftly. It seemed they would be forced into a replay when Muzzy Izzet equalised Paul McCarthy's goal, but they are clearly a resilient crew. </p> <p>For Sanchez it was a remarkable coaching achievement given the resources at his disposal - a playing staff of 26 and 10 of them injured. At the final whistle, half a dozen limped over to join in the celebrations, among them the record signing Sean Devine and leading scorer Andy Rammell. </p> <p>The white-hot climax scarcely looked likely after a lukewarm first half that Leicester shaded. Robbie Savage did test Martin Taylor with a header from Andy Impey's cross but they were largely restricted to long-range shots, from Izzet and Savage, which the goalkeeper dealt with comfortably. </p> <p>Wycombe responded with drives by Dannie Bulman and Brown, which Simon Royce turned aside, but it took a confrontation between Savage and Brown, and an exchange of yellow cards, to enliven matters. It was a bit like Anthea Turner and Chris Eubank in the celebrity Big Brother - you wondered which might go first. </p> <p>It all changed four minutes after the interval. After Impey had fouled Michael Simpson on the right touchline, Brown curled in a menacing free-kick with his left foot and McCarthy arrived ahead of his marker Ade Akinbiyi to bundle the ball past a static Royce. </p> <p>Now Leicester were riled and, urged on by frustrated fans who must have seen the game as a golden opportunity to progress, they bombarded Wanderers. It produced only one real chance, however, Akinbiyi heading Stefan Oakes's cross too close to Taylor. </p> <p>When Leicester changed approach, and thought about it for a moment, they duly got a goal. Gerry Taggart, desperately driving his team forward, played the ball wide to the substitute Darren Eadie and from his cross - this time a low one - Izzet, arriving late, had a simple tap-in. Then, Leicester should have been ahead within seconds. Izzet slipped the ball through to Akinbiyi but Taylor blocked his snatched shot. </p> <p>Reprieved, Wycombe scented their chance, and Sanchez sent on fresh legs, in Essandoh and Stewart Castledine, to replace the labouring makeshift striker Keith Ryan and George Clegg, a 20-year-old on loan from Manchester United. Their deserts should have come 12 minutes from time. Brown sought to get in another of his swinging crosses from the right but this time the left arm of Oakes intervened. It was understandable that the referee might have missed him clearly moving an arm towards the ball but less so a linesman a mere 15 yards away - and in line. For running 40 yards along the touchline to point as much out, Sanchez was sent down the tunnel. </p> <p>It was there, on a TV monitor, that he witnessed the astonishing endgame. Bulman swung in a cross from the right to the far post and Jamie Bates, hitherto a towering presence in defence, now used his head in attack to guide the ball back across goal for Essandoh to head powerfully home. </p> <p>For Wycombe, Roy was the boy.

It was O'Neil, too, who squandered another golden opportunity near the break when he went clear on the left of the area and created a good shooting position. Instead, he opted for the cut-back to the unmarked David Zitelli which was played just behind the Frenchman, giving him little chance of exploiting the moment. Hibs' superiority was more potently threatened by the injury-enforced departures of their captain, Franck Sauzee, and the impressive left-back Ulrik Laursen. The Frenchman stretched a hamstring in the second minute and was replaced in the 26th by Ian Murray, while the Dane departed with a damaged calf muscle after half-an-hour. If Hibs were a little less cavalier thereafter, they remained nevertheless the likelier to score. McManus's late header from six yards, off Latapy's wickedly accurate free kick on the right, merely confirmed their superiority.",

And let's not forget that even the sponsors' money is, somewhere, the consumers' money'. </p> <p>He does not name names but Ronaldo, Luis Figo and Alessandro del Piero are all in the \u00a3100,000-a-week bracket. Aigner believes the greater freedom of movement given to players last Monday will create more of that breed. </p> <p>Warming to his theme, Aigner warns: It's also the culture that's coming in with these superstars earning so much money. The agents for some of them always bring things into the media. Fans dislike these transactions, especially when players come in and don't perform well and cash in.' He cites Manchester United as a laudable exception. </p> <p>'Top players there earn a fantastic amount but the fans aren't critical because they win, behave properly and are proper to the fans. There are no signs of the decadence which you can find nowadays.' Decadence is a strong word and will resonate with many fans. In his view 'Southern Europe - Spain and Italy - is much more inclined to have excesses than Britain in this respect.' </p> <p>Aigner, a trained economist, is outspoken on the 'difficulties' created by the enormous sums that have flowed into the game. Too many people 'see football as a money-making business in itself'. His targets are sponsors, those running TV companies and players who cynically 'cash in', rather than clubs. In his view, football has become 'too much of a commercial activity'. He dislikes the trend, most pronounced in England but now being replicated in Italy, of clubs becoming companies. </p> <p>He sees this, coupled with high ticket prices, pay-TV subscriptions, saturation television coverage and players' earnings - as likely to alienate fans. </p> <p>'We can't make the public pay for TV and at the same time increase the prices of the tickets. Somewhere you have to be loyal to your fans and say, \"We're making so much money that we will reduce the prices\" - that would be fair play. But I don't think we're going that way.' </p> <p>Aigner agreed to revamp the Champions League to dissuade Europe's leading clubs from breaking away. He is often portrayed as a prisoner of the G14, the influential group of clubs that includes Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United. Mindful of the need to keep the G14 happy, he is also determined to protect the game's roots, as befits someone who played, coached and refereed amateur football in his native Bavaria. Yet he warns that the game is starting to 'disintegrate' as money pours in. </p> <p>'Football grew because everybody put in. Now everybody is trying to take out,' he says. 'There are too many vested, competing interests. The common interest is not evident - everyone is trying to protect their own interest - the clubs, players, referees, club presidents, the G14, the Euro-League clubs. So we have a disintegration factor, and I regret that.' </p> <p>Aigner does recognise the benefits that money brings - the \u00a3400million-a-year generated by the Champions League helps nurture the game in the poorer countries among Uefa's 51 member states. But he would like to see a broader distribution of the wealth. </p> <p>He is worried, too, by elitism - another by-product of the flood of money: 'In middle-sized countries like Scotland, the Netherlands and Portugal, two, three or four clubs are always at the top and the quality players gather in these clubs, which then dominate the league. This is not a problem in the big markets, though. In England you have Ipswich doing well, La Coru\u00f1a in Spain and in Italy the Roman clubs are up.' </p> <p>Aigner is concerned about the gap between a handful of clubs and the rest in many countries and between the biggest clubs in the major countries - England, Italy, Spain, Germany and France - and the others. 'In some countries, First Division clubs can't get a shirt sponsor because sponsors want teams who play in Europe, not just in their own league.' </p> <p>Uefa has decreed that the proposed Euro or Atlantic League so that clubs such as Ajax or Rangers can once again take on Milan or Inter with a realistic chance of success, is not the way forward. Aigner is looking at alternatives. </p> <p>And Aigner insists the momentum for a breakaway European league has gone - for now. 'The G14 know their fans would not understand it. There is no European soul in the fans yet. If you serve fans in England or Italy the menu, they want European football as the pudding, not the main dish.' </p> <p>Subtle warning to the would-be wreckers, or a genuine assessment of the breakaway threat? With the G14's action now set up as an 'economic interest group', with an office in Brussels, it seems further conflict between them and Uefa is almost inevitable. </p> <p>England, he believes, is an example of where football still works pretty well. He applauds the Manchester United fans' campaign against the Sky takeover and Brighton fans' backing for their club's search for a new home. 'I could not say that I like the English game, but I like what goes with English football - the atmosphere in the stadia, the passion of the people and the fact that the fan is an expert.' He lets slip that he has supported Ipswich Town since the time of Robson, Muhren and Thijssen. Gerhard Aigner: Uefa's patron of underdogs.</p>",

Aigner is concerned about the gap between a handful of clubs and the rest in many countries and between the biggest clubs in the major countries - England, Italy, Spain, Germany and France - and the others. 'In some countries, First Division clubs can't get a shirt sponsor because sponsors want teams who play in Europe, not just in their own league.' Uefa has decreed that the proposed Euro or Atlantic League so that clubs such as Ajax or Rangers can once again take on Milan or Inter with a realistic chance of success, is not the way forward. Aigner is looking at alternatives. And Aigner insists the momentum for a breakaway European league has gone - for now. 'The G14 know their fans would not understand it. There is no European soul in the fans yet. If you serve fans in England or Italy the menu, they want European football as the pudding, not the main dish.' Subtle warning to the would-be wreckers, or a genuine assessment of the breakaway threat? With the G14's action now set up as an 'economic interest group', with an office in Brussels, it seems further conflict between them and Uefa is almost inevitable. England, he believes, is an example of where football still works pretty well. He applauds the Manchester United fans' campaign against the Sky takeover and Brighton fans' backing for their club's search for a new home. 'I could not say that I like the English game, but I like what goes with English football - the atmosphere in the stadia, the passion of the people and the fact that the fan is an expert.' He lets slip that he has supported Ipswich Town since the time of Robson, Muhren and Thijssen. Gerhard Aigner: Uefa's patron of underdogs.",

Then the tinted-windowed Range Rover of Stanley Victor Collymore (registration no: S7AN V) arrived. Cue a ml\u00e9e as the door opened. </p> <p>Stan (funny how when you say the name, everyone knows who you mean, even if Eminem has lately offered some competition) did not stay still to issue his signature, however. He headed for the dressing room and scribbled as he went. First rule of celebrity: keep on the move when you're signing autographs. </p> <p>I was there observing for a documen-tary we were supposed to be making. A few months earlier, over a meeting at the trendy St Martin's Lane hotel in London, where he puffed on the odd Marlborough Light but drank mineral water, Stan had agreed to the fly-on-the-wall film in an attempt to show everyone that he was not the surly, miserable loner of reputation. He asked for his fee to go to a charity for people with depressive illnesses. </p> <p>Leicester City put the block on the project, though, and the reasons soon emerged. There were tales of him being overweight and not trying a leg in matches, stories of him wanting a better contract when he had not yet done enough to justify it. The final straw was a dressing-room punch-up with his fellow striker Trevor Benjamin at half-time of a reserve game. Soon after Collymore had been shipped out to Bradford City, that nice Peter Taylor wrote to me to apologise for his veto and hoped that I now understood. </p> <p>But he didn't understand Stan and how could anyone else? Many have tried, few have succeeded. Now the problem has apparently gone away, as many managers have hoped it would, with the news that he has retired from football, at the wastefully premature - and dangerous -- age of 30. Collymore is almost a morality tale for our times; so many issues of modern football are there embodied in him. Celebrity, arising from notoriety rather than achievement, is one. Huge financial rewards, that give security to players in whom the fires of professional pride do not burn, rather than stoke in them hunger for success, is another. </p> <p>Then there is the lack of sympathy and support for anyone wealthy but undermined by demons in these jealous days where money should equal contentment. Add to the mix the persistence with Collymore by so many frustrated managers, because there are few players with his talent around, and he became fuel for heated debate. </p> <p>And Stan had - has - outrageous talent. Physically he had menacing presence and was a powerful header of the ball. He had a keen eye for a sweeping crossfield pass. His pace alarmed defences. His finishing could be explosive. Footage of that remarkable 4-3 game between Liverpool and Newcastle United four years ago, when he scored twice, and his hat-trick for Leicester against Sunderland just a year ago this week, confirms it all. </p> <p>Everywhere he went, he initially tantalised with some astonishing cameos, before seeming to become quickly bored, possibly at how easy this simple-but- difficult game could be. Perhaps it was his unusual failure to make instant impact at Real Oviedo - and realisation that, at his age, waning natural talent needed the maintenance of hard work - that prompted his decision. </p> <p>January is always the cruellest month for a depressive. The turning point in Collymore's career certainly came in that month, on Tuesday 10th, in 1995. Collymore was Alex Ferguson's first choice for a new striker for Manchester United. He placed a call to Frank Clark, then Stan's manager at Nottingham Forest, but Clark made himself unavailable for it. 'I just wonder_' Ferguson said to himself and phoned Kevin Keegan at Newcastle. Keegan was indeed willing to sell Andy Cole to him. Ferguson was more the man Collymore needed than, subsequently, Roy Evans at Liverpool. </p> <p>In January '99, Collymore finally recognised he needed help and was treated at the Priory. A year on, he agreed to explain how depression had affected his career and, more important, his life, and had almost driven him to suicide. It won him some understanding, at least; perhaps helped him in some small way to move from being out-and-out villain to more the Marmite of the game - you either love him or hate him. </p> <p>A few days ago, I asked his latest representative if Stan would like to talk about his decision, particularly after telling me that previous year that he had years left in his legs. 'I've been instructed to look at a money tabloid deal,' came the reply. Of course it is Collymore's prerogative, but it is exactly the sort of response that provokes ambivalence towards him. </p> <p>Stan is apparently depressed no longer. 'It's because he's not that he has been able to make this decision,' - an 'irrevocable' one - said the agent. 'He feels he has gone as far as he can go and wants to get out while people remember him as a top footballer.' Hmm. Will they? </p> <p>You can never inflict on people what you think they should do with their lives - in this case we are tempted because so many of us would so love to have Collymore's ability and are certain we would honour it - but anyone who believes in fulfilling God-given talent will hope he reconsiders and becomes yet what he could become. We've wanted it for Gazza for years. </p> <p>And perhaps when Stan has had a few months with his family, or dabbled with TV and empty celebrity, he will reassess and risk tampering with some myth that he was a 'great' and actually decide to prove it. Who knows, a break might also show that a love of the game is in his soul. Quitting is easy. Anyone can do that. So much harder to pick yourself up and keep trying.</p>",

On the other side, pay-TV companies would love to screen World Cup matches and believe they are being unfairly excluded.",

Wenger had already put on Wiltord for Robert Pires on 71 minutes, and Henry admitted that when Wenger elected to replace Dennis Bergkamp with Nwankwo Kanu , even he was stunned by the decision. 'I was so bad, I did not deserve to be on the pitch,' Henry said. 'I thought I had to be the one to be replaced.' </p> <p>Maybe so, but Wenger's decision did make a lot of sense - as, indeed, Henry went on to emphasise by scoring the only goal. </p> <p>All players have their bad matches and, in a lot of cases, keeping them on the field - and thus subjecting them to the displeasure of the crowd - is self-defeating. But as far as strikers are concerned, I think one always has to bear in mind that if they are getting plenty of chances, the bad luck they might be experiencing in applying the finishing touch is bound to change eventually. </p> <p>One has only to look at the scoring records of Henry and Bergkamp this season to appreciate that Henry, while not as sharp in front of goal as he usually is, would still have been perceived by Wenger as the likelier of the two to break the deadlock. The other reason why I think Wenger did what he did - and this is probably the key - concerns the difference between Henry and Bergkamp in their styles of play. </p> <p>Bergkamp, like Kanu, likes to drift into deep positions; when an attack is being developed, they have a tendency to come towards the ball, which gives the opposition the scope to push up and squeeze the play. Henry, on the other hand, is always looking to go forward, into the space behind defences, so his presence has the effect of forcing the opposition to defend closer to their goal and creating a bit more space for the likes of Bergkamp and Kanu to express themselves. </p> <p>The use of substitutes, outside those forced on you because of injuries, is one of the areas which best reflects the essence of being a team manager; and, indeed, the differences between being a manager and a coach. </p> <p>I think we would all concede that some substitutions work more through luck than judgment. Sometimes, you will just put someone on for no other reason than the feeling that the team need a fresh face - I would love to be able to give the impres sion that some of my substitutions have been tactical master-strokes, but the reality has been different. </p> <p>However, there is no doubt that using substitutes properly - and certainly being able to keep a clear enough head to be able to do so - is an art. I think all managers start a game with two or three alternative game plans in mind, but inevitably, you cannot plan for everything. For example, there are some instances where managers suddenly have to substitute a player to alleviate the danger of his being sent off. </p> <p>When it comes to making substitutions under the pressure of your team trailing and struggling to get back into the game, some managers are recognised as being more adept than others. </p> <p>Sir Alf Ramsey never lived down his mistake in the crucial 1974 World Cup qualifying tie against Poland in not sending on striker Kevin Hector until 90 seconds from the end.

Sanchez was so hard up for a forward as injury had hit his squad that he tried to talk Gianluca Vialli into a comeback. </p> <p>Sanchez may just be pleased he did not succeed. Essandoh may have no pedigree - a bit of football in Finland last year and some Scottish experience - but his stoppage-time goal propelled Wycombe, a non-League side just eight years ago, into the FA Cup semi-finals at the expense of Premiership hosts Leicester. </p> <p>Sanchez had been sent off from the dugout after protesting that his team should have had a penalty for hand-ball before Essandoh's timely goal. 'He never got that far forward when we were playing together,' joked Terry Gibson, Sanchez's assistant and former Wimbledon team-mate, of his boss's touchline dash. </p> <p>There had been mixed feelings for Sanchez, his delight marred by a series of events that so nearly conspired against his team. 'I question why referees and linesmen are out there if they can't make the big decisions,' he said. 'It was an obvious penalty [as the Leicester manager Peter Taylor agreed] and it could have cost us over \u00a31 million, stopped me building a team and damaged my career as a manager. </p> <p>'It's easy to give out a red card for someone taking off his shirt [schemer Stephen Brown] and celebrating, not so easy to give a penalty against a Premiership team. I've always said that too many referees know the rules but they don't know the game. They need to have their livelihoods on the line like ours. </p> <p>'But then, everybody wants Premiership teams to get through. Everybody except the public, that is. The public know that there's more to the game than the Premiership.' </p> <p>Once more composed, Sanchez savoured the achievement. 'The important thing is that we have won the game. I thought we were the better team. Today was our best chance, because the Premiership team usually get themselves together for a replay, even if you're at home. Today luck favoured the brave. We showed real guts and determination. People said we have ignited the competition. We certainly have now.' </p> <p>Was it as good as his 1988 moment? 'It's a different feeling. As a player, you get selfish pleasure when you score. As a manager you take more pride in the team situation.' </p> <p>Essandoh, he said, had not particularly impressed him in a reserve game against QPR, a start against Port Vale and a substitute appearance against Reading, but it had been a case of needs must when Essandoh arrived at the club 10 days ago. </p> <p>Wycombe's players had traded any Cup bonuses for salary up front earlier in the season and were on just \u00a3130 to reach the last four. 'You can be the richest player in the world, but if you haven't been involved in a game like that, you are poor,' said Sanchez. </p> <p>Wycombe will go down in the competition's folklore, joining Plymouth Argyle in 1984 and Chesterfield in '97 as semi-finalists from the third tier of the English game. Follow that, Tranmere, previously the biggest shock-sup pliers after their 4-3 win over Southampton. Like his mentor Glenn Hoddle that night, Peter Taylor was shell-shocked.

'He never got that far forward when we were playing together,' joked Terry Gibson, Sanchez's assistant and former Wimbledon team-mate, of his boss's touchline dash. There had been mixed feelings for Sanchez, his delight marred by a series of events that so nearly conspired against his team. 'I question why referees and linesmen are out there if they can't make the big decisions,' he said. 'It was an obvious penalty [as the Leicester manager Peter Taylor agreed] and it could have cost us over \u00a31 million, stopped me building a team and damaged my career as a manager. 'It's easy to give out a red card for someone taking off his shirt [schemer Stephen Brown] and celebrating, not so easy to give a penalty against a Premiership team. I've always said that too many referees know the rules but they don't know the game. They need to have their livelihoods on the line like ours. 'But then, everybody wants Premiership teams to get through. Everybody except the public, that is. The public know that there's more to the game than the Premiership.' Once more composed, Sanchez savoured the achievement. 'The important thing is that we have won the game. I thought we were the better team. Today was our best chance, because the Premiership team usually get themselves together for a replay, even if you're at home. Today luck favoured the brave. We showed real guts and determination. People said we have ignited the competition. We certainly have now.' Was it as good as his 1988 moment? 'It's a different feeling. As a player, you get selfish pleasure when you score. As a manager you take more pride in the team situation.' Essandoh, he said, had not particularly impressed him in a reserve game against QPR, a start against Port Vale and a substitute appearance against Reading, but it had been a case of needs must when Essandoh arrived at the club 10 days ago. Wycombe's players had traded any Cup bonuses for salary up front earlier in the season and were on just \u00a3130 to reach the last four. 'You can be the richest player in the world, but if you haven't been involved in a game like that, you are poor,' said Sanchez. Wycombe will go down in the competition's folklore, joining Plymouth Argyle in 1984 and Chesterfield in '97 as semi-finalists from the third tier of the English game. Follow that, Tranmere, previously the biggest shock-sup pliers after their 4-3 win over Southampton. Like his mentor Glenn Hoddle that night, Peter Taylor was shell-shocked. 'I never, ever thought it would happen,' he said, after his side were made to look ordinary. 'I was staggered.'",

There is morbo between Barcelona and Real, Betis and Sevilla, Serbs and Croats etc. </p> <p>Using the notion of morbo , Ball has written nothing less than a guide to Spanish life. This is a man who lives in San Sebastian, has played beach football with the legendary winger Lopez Ufarte, and knows someone who taught Luis Arconada English. (Apparently the keeper complained that he would always be remembered for his blunder in the final of the 1984 European Championship.) </p> <p>The book mixes the historical and the personal, most impressively in his treatment of the 'Guruceta affair'. Emilio Guruceta was a referee who gave Real a soft penalty in a Barcelona-Real Madrid game in 1970, and two months later was driving a BMW. 'To a whole generation,' writes Ball, 'the Guruceta game represents incontrovertible evidence that Madrid could pay off the refs.' </p> <p>In 1987, while driving another BMW, Guruceta was killed in a car crash. Later he was revealed to have taken a bribe from Anderlecht before they beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 to reach the final of the Uefa Cup in 1984. </p> <p>So far, so standard. All this is easy to write - just a matter of regurgitating history books. But one night Ball was sitting in a San Sebastian hotel watching a match on TV when there was a power failure, and in the dark silence he discovered that one of the other men in the room, a tailor, had been Guruceta's linesman at the Barcelona-Real game. Quizzed in the dark by Ball, the tailor made a cryptic comment implying that Guruceta was murdered. </p> <p>Ball gives due honour to Bar\u00e7a and Real Madrid, but also devotes an entire chapter to his conversations with Seville taxi drivers about Betis and Sevilla, and examines the Basque country, which has only three million inhabitants but four teams in the Primera Liga staffed very largely by locals. In fact, if the Basques ever gained independence the Spanish national team would be sunk: the region has produced many of Spain's best players, including almost all the great goalkeepers and the current bright light, Gaizka Mendieta. Even Alav\u00e9s, one of the smallest Basque teams, have all but qualified for the Uefa Cup semi-final with their 3-0 win against Rayo Vallecano on Thursday. </p> <p>One year of freakish over-performance in Europe could be dismissed as good fortune, but Spanish teams are doing it for the second time running. Last season they provided three Champions League semi-finalists, and now Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson is simply being his usual bland self when he says that Real Madrid are probably the world's best team. Clearly something is going on. </p> <p>Ball's explanation is weak. 'It must be something to do with what the Spanish call calidad [quality of technique],' he writes. 'They are obsessed with the concept now, relegating cruder notions of physical fitness to the realms of secondary importance.' That doesn't explain much, given that even some Scottish clubs now relegate cruder notions of physical fitness to the realms of secondary importance. </p> <p>Rather, there seem to be two reasons why Spanish (and English) clubs have recently overtaken the Italians. First, there is the curse of being first. For most of the Nineties Italian clubs were the best. They didn't have to question themselves, to eradicate their weaknesses, and so the pace of their game seems to have dropped a notch, while they also appear to have lost the knack of switching from defence to attack when required, as Roma showed at home to Liverpool. Meanwhile, Spanish and English clubs have improved, following the old Avis rental car motto: 'We're number two. We try harder.' </p> <p>The second reason is simply confidence. English clubs such as Aston Villa, Everton and Spurs won European trophies in the Eighties because they thought they could. They assumed that being English they were better than obscure foreign outfits such as Juventus or Bayern Munich, and so were never overawed. Now little Spanish clubs such as Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a and Rayo Vallecano think they are the best, and therefore become so. </p> <p>The next round of the Champions League may produce three Anglo-Spanish encounters. That would give us firm evidence as to who is Europe's number two. Number one, for now, is Ball.</p>",

In 1987, while driving another BMW, Guruceta was killed in a car crash. Later he was revealed to have taken a bribe from Anderlecht before they beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 to reach the final of the Uefa Cup in 1984. So far, so standard. All this is easy to write - just a matter of regurgitating history books. But one night Ball was sitting in a San Sebastian hotel watching a match on TV when there was a power failure, and in the dark silence he discovered that one of the other men in the room, a tailor, had been Guruceta's linesman at the Barcelona-Real game. Quizzed in the dark by Ball, the tailor made a cryptic comment implying that Guruceta was murdered. Ball gives due honour to Bar\u00e7a and Real Madrid, but also devotes an entire chapter to his conversations with Seville taxi drivers about Betis and Sevilla, and examines the Basque country, which has only three million inhabitants but four teams in the Primera Liga staffed very largely by locals. In fact, if the Basques ever gained independence the Spanish national team would be sunk: the region has produced many of Spain's best players, including almost all the great goalkeepers and the current bright light, Gaizka Mendieta. Even Alav\u00e9s, one of the smallest Basque teams, have all but qualified for the Uefa Cup semi-final with their 3-0 win against Rayo Vallecano on Thursday. One year of freakish over-performance in Europe could be dismissed as good fortune, but Spanish teams are doing it for the second time running. Last season they provided three Champions League semi-finalists, and now Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson is simply being his usual bland self when he says that Real Madrid are probably the world's best team. Clearly something is going on. Ball's explanation is weak. 'It must be something to do with what the Spanish call calidad [quality of technique],' he writes. 'They are obsessed with the concept now, relegating cruder notions of physical fitness to the realms of secondary importance.' That doesn't explain much, given that even some Scottish clubs now relegate cruder notions of physical fitness to the realms of secondary importance. Rather, there seem to be two reasons why Spanish (and English) clubs have recently overtaken the Italians. First, there is the curse of being first. For most of the Nineties Italian clubs were the best. They didn't have to question themselves, to eradicate their weaknesses, and so the pace of their game seems to have dropped a notch, while they also appear to have lost the knack of switching from defence to attack when required, as Roma showed at home to Liverpool. Meanwhile, Spanish and English clubs have improved, following the old Avis rental car motto: 'We're number two. We try harder.' The second reason is simply confidence. English clubs such as Aston Villa, Everton and Spurs won European trophies in the Eighties because they thought they could. They assumed that being English they were better than obscure foreign outfits such as Juventus or Bayern Munich, and so were never overawed. Now little Spanish clubs such as Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a and Rayo Vallecano think they are the best, and therefore become so. The next round of the Champions League may produce three Anglo-Spanish encounters. That would give us firm evidence as to who is Europe's number two. Number one, for now, is Ball.",

Medical students are overwhelmingly in favour of random alcohol and drug testing and pressured the BMA into considering tests last year. Last year the GMC recorded a 50 per cent rise in complaints against medical staff, many of which were attributed to younger GPs appalled at the practices of their senior colleagues.

A telephone helpline for queries is taking up to 2,000 calls a month.</p> <p>Famous Britons who have had the treatment include Anne Robinson, Noel Gallagher, Martine McCutcheon, Martin Amis, David Bowie and Margaret Thatcher. However, dentists report that people going for the treatment now come from all backgrounds.</p> <p>Julian Perry, managing director of the Ora Dent chain which specialises in cosmetic dentistry, said: 'It now transcends all socio-economic barriers - I have patients who are out of work. I have everyone from shop assistants to company directors, and they come from all ages.' The growth in demand is higher in the more affluent South. It is also becoming popular among older people, who are more likely to have high disposable incomes. Treatments cost from a few hundred pounds to one patient who spent \u00a345,000.</p> <p>Hayley Wright, who works in the shipping operations department of an oil company, spent about \u00a33,000 on six veneers to disguise her previously crooked front teeth.</p> <p>'It's a good investment - I'm really pleased with it. I used to smile with my mouth closed. But they look so good that when I smile now, I consciously open my mouth,' she said.</p> <p>'I now have no inhibition about laughing and smiling with my mouth open.'</p> <p>The growth in demand is being fuelled by falling prices; new techniques allowing dentists to do more and ensure it is pain-free; and a massive marketing drive by private dentists keen to increase their income. Revenues from traditional dentistry such as fillings are falling as teeth improve.</p> <p>However, it is also driven by people no longer being content to endure 'English mouth'.</p> <p>'People want to look better, and they've always been spending their money on clothes, hair and nails, but now it is coming down to the teeth and smiles, which have a big influence on sexual attraction,' said Amarjit Gill, chair of the private practice committee of the British Dental Association.</p> <p>The biggest growth area is bleaching of the teeth, to make them whiter or all the same colour. New techniques mean it is possible to make a single darker tooth the same colour as the rest, and to choose the precise colour you want your teeth to be.</p> <p>The usual method for straightening teeth is veneers. But the emerging science of 'cosmetic recontouring' means that, with the aid of a computer, a row of crooked teeth can be straightened with grinding and additions. Cosmetic dentists aim for the 'golden proportion' where teeth are symmetrical and have the most aesthetically pleasing widths and proportions.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

The number of dentists being trained in it is going up by 25 per cent a year, and there's no end to it.' A telephone helpline for queries is taking up to 2,000 calls a month. Famous Britons who have had the treatment include Anne Robinson, Noel Gallagher, Martine McCutcheon, Martin Amis, David Bowie and Margaret Thatcher. However, dentists report that people going for the treatment now come from all backgrounds. Julian Perry, managing director of the Ora Dent chain which specialises in cosmetic dentistry, said: 'It now transcends all socio-economic barriers - I have patients who are out of work. I have everyone from shop assistants to company directors, and they come from all ages.' The growth in demand is higher in the more affluent South. It is also becoming popular among older people, who are more likely to have high disposable incomes. Treatments cost from a few hundred pounds to one patient who spent \u00a345,000. Hayley Wright, who works in the shipping operations department of an oil company, spent about \u00a33,000 on six veneers to disguise her previously crooked front teeth. 'It's a good investment - I'm really pleased with it. I used to smile with my mouth closed. But they look so good that when I smile now, I consciously open my mouth,' she said. 'I now have no inhibition about laughing and smiling with my mouth open.' The growth in demand is being fuelled by falling prices; new techniques allowing dentists to do more and ensure it is pain-free; and a massive marketing drive by private dentists keen to increase their income. Revenues from traditional dentistry such as fillings are falling as teeth improve. However, it is also driven by people no longer being content to endure 'English mouth'. 'People want to look better, and they've always been spending their money on clothes, hair and nails, but now it is coming down to the teeth and smiles, which have a big influence on sexual attraction,' said Amarjit Gill, chair of the private practice committee of the British Dental Association. The biggest growth area is bleaching of the teeth, to make them whiter or all the same colour. New techniques mean it is possible to make a single darker tooth the same colour as the rest, and to choose the precise colour you want your teeth to be. The usual method for straightening teeth is veneers. But the emerging science of 'cosmetic recontouring' means that, with the aid of a computer, a row of crooked teeth can be straightened with grinding and additions. Cosmetic dentists aim for the 'golden proportion' where teeth are symmetrical and have the most aesthetically pleasing widths and proportions. anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

They will have to negotiate with Congress and the popular President, Vicente Fox, who has so far welcomed the march as heralding peace in a conflict that has cost 140 lives and damaged Mexico's international reputation.</p> <p>One daily newspaper, Milenio, carried out an opinion poll asking 'Who is winning - Marcos or Fox?' The fact that 44 per cent answered 'Marcos', compared with 25 per cent for Fox is an indication of how strange a phenomenon the Zapatour has been.</p> <p>In Milpa Alta, on the outskirts of the capital, the Zapatistas are preparing for the final push. The walls around the football pitch are painted with welcoming slogans, a hill overlooking the town spells out EZLN in massive stone letters, andearnest children are interviewing bystanders for a school project. One project the whole of Mexico is concerned with is whether the country's two towering political figures can achieve the peace and justice both profess to seek.</p> <p>'The problem is not whether Marcos or Fox is more popular; it is whether we, the indigenous people, are going to have to continue living in the basement of history,' Marcos tells the crowd at one of the rallies he has addressed since the march set off on 25 February. But while he always says his personality is unimportant, few doubt that without his tactical flair, avoidance of dogma and articulation of inequalities, the movement would have remained in the jungles.</p> <p>It is five years since ex-President Ernesto Zedillo 'unmasked' Marcos as Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n, a former university teacher from a middle-class family in the eastern port of Tampico. But such has been the aura of Marcos's mystery that last week a magazine was still investigating his past.</p> <p>It suggested he had been educated by the Jesuits, had eschewed the drug culture of the Sixties, liked to put on school plays, read voraciously and already had a pipe clenched between his teeth as a teenager. He was supposedly a keen school debater and one classmate recalled Guill\u00e9n telling him on his graduation day: 'I am going to be a revolutionary and struggle against everything you represent.'</p> <p>Yet not everyone is completely under his spell. Political commentator Denise Dresser said Marcos might have to reinvent himself again to achieve his aims. 'I give him a great deal of credit for forcing Mexico to look at its indigenous population and take it seriously,' she said. 'But I think I have been disillusioned by what I perceive as his incredible vanity, his blas\u00e9 attitude towards very serious issues and his inability to be self-critical.'</p> <p>On the right there have been expressions of outrage. The governor of Quer\u00e9taro, Ignacio Loyola, called him a 'traitor' and conservative commentators have mocked his international 'groupies' and his poetry - describing him as the subpoeta - and claimed his supporters among the half million indigenous poor in the capital knew little of him.</p> <p>One Mexican who will not be in the Z\u00f3calo today is Fox. But the Zapatour has focused attention as much on the similarities between the two main players on this stage as on their political differences.</p> <p>Like Marcos, Fox has a powerful iconic image with his trademark cowboy boots and his 'Fox' belt buckle, an abundance of self-confidence and an ability to reach an audience beyond the consti-tuency of PAN, the conservative party he led to victory last year over the terminally corrupt Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).</p> <p>Throughout the march, Marcos has questioned Fox's sincerity and poured scorn on his neo-liberal philosophy and Coca-Cola business background. Fox last week declared himself tranquilo about the march as he tried to harness it to his own peace agenda.</p> <p>Yesterday, Fox said that he welcomed the Zapatistas with 'open arms' and invited Marcos to Los Pinos, the presidnetial residence for talks about 'indigenous people, about Mexico, about the poor.' Fox said that 'we are close to peace because there is no alternative left for Marcos or for President Fox. If either of the two fails, we will look very bad, extremely bad.' He added that four months ago nobody would have believed that Marcos could have been in the capital 'as peaceful as any other tourist.'</p> <p>Enrique Krauze, one of the most established of Mexican intellectuals, said last week in Proceso magazine: 'If neo-Zapatism does not take advantage of the President's favourable attitude, it will lose a unique opportunity. They will not meet a President more disposed towards them in their dreams.'</p>",

One daily newspaper, Milenio, carried out an opinion poll asking 'Who is winning - Marcos or Fox?' The fact that 44 per cent answered 'Marcos', compared with 25 per cent for Fox is an indication of how strange a phenomenon the Zapatour has been. In Milpa Alta, on the outskirts of the capital, the Zapatistas are preparing for the final push. The walls around the football pitch are painted with welcoming slogans, a hill overlooking the town spells out EZLN in massive stone letters, andearnest children are interviewing bystanders for a school project. One project the whole of Mexico is concerned with is whether the country's two towering political figures can achieve the peace and justice both profess to seek. 'The problem is not whether Marcos or Fox is more popular; it is whether we, the indigenous people, are going to have to continue living in the basement of history,' Marcos tells the crowd at one of the rallies he has addressed since the march set off on 25 February. But while he always says his personality is unimportant, few doubt that without his tactical flair, avoidance of dogma and articulation of inequalities, the movement would have remained in the jungles. It is five years since ex-President Ernesto Zedillo 'unmasked' Marcos as Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n, a former university teacher from a middle-class family in the eastern port of Tampico. But such has been the aura of Marcos's mystery that last week a magazine was still investigating his past. It suggested he had been educated by the Jesuits, had eschewed the drug culture of the Sixties, liked to put on school plays, read voraciously and already had a pipe clenched between his teeth as a teenager. He was supposedly a keen school debater and one classmate recalled Guill\u00e9n telling him on his graduation day: 'I am going to be a revolutionary and struggle against everything you represent.' Yet not everyone is completely under his spell. Political commentator Denise Dresser said Marcos might have to reinvent himself again to achieve his aims. 'I give him a great deal of credit for forcing Mexico to look at its indigenous population and take it seriously,' she said. 'But I think I have been disillusioned by what I perceive as his incredible vanity, his blas\u00e9 attitude towards very serious issues and his inability to be self-critical.' On the right there have been expressions of outrage. The governor of Quer\u00e9taro, Ignacio Loyola, called him a 'traitor' and conservative commentators have mocked his international 'groupies' and his poetry - describing him as the subpoeta - and claimed his supporters among the half million indigenous poor in the capital knew little of him. One Mexican who will not be in the Z\u00f3calo today is Fox. But the Zapatour has focused attention as much on the similarities between the two main players on this stage as on their political differences. Like Marcos, Fox has a powerful iconic image with his trademark cowboy boots and his 'Fox' belt buckle, an abundance of self-confidence and an ability to reach an audience beyond the consti-tuency of PAN, the conservative party he led to victory last year over the terminally corrupt Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Throughout the march, Marcos has questioned Fox's sincerity and poured scorn on his neo-liberal philosophy and Coca-Cola business background. Fox last week declared himself tranquilo about the march as he tried to harness it to his own peace agenda. Yesterday, Fox said that he welcomed the Zapatistas with 'open arms' and invited Marcos to Los Pinos, the presidnetial residence for talks about 'indigenous people, about Mexico, about the poor.' Fox said that 'we are close to peace because there is no alternative left for Marcos or for President Fox. If either of the two fails, we will look very bad, extremely bad.' He added that four months ago nobody would have believed that Marcos could have been in the capital 'as peaceful as any other tourist.' Enrique Krauze, one of the most established of Mexican intellectuals, said last week in Proceso magazine: 'If neo-Zapatism does not take advantage of the President's favourable attitude, it will lose a unique opportunity. They will not meet a President more disposed towards them in their dreams.'",

The service was halted in 1982 because of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Memorials to Mau Mau Almost four decades after independence from Britain, Kenya has declared several sites linked to the Mau Mau rebellion to be national monuments. The independent People newspaper reported that the trench where the Mau Mau leader, Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi, was shot and captured by British troops, and a mass grave where slain Mau Mau fighters were buried, were both listed. The Mau Mau uprising of the Fifties ultimately led to independence for the East African nation in 1963. Arafat calls for peace talks Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat called on Israel's new government to resume peace talks on the basis of understandings reached in previous negotiations. There was no immediate Israeli reaction, but Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has insisted that the five-month-old intifada against Israeli occupation must end before talks resume. Spanish policeman mourned Thousands of people took to the streets yesterday to mourn a Spanish policeman killed by a car bomb thought to have been planted by the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA. Inaki Totorika Vega, 25, died in Hernani, a pro-independence stronghold near San Sebasti\u00e1n. Tensions in the Basque country are running high ahead of local elections on May 13, which officials fear could trigger more violence. Kuchma clings to rule in murder scandal Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, above, said he saw no reason to resign, despite growing protests. He claimed in an interview with German magazine Focus : 'The voters still support me.' On Friday Ukrainian riot police clashed with scores of protesters as thousands took to the streets. They demanded Kuchma's resignation over allegations he was involved in the death of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, whose headless corpse was found outside Kiev last year. Diplomat 'stole PM's \u00a32.4m' Japanese police have arrested ex-diplomat Katsutoshi Matsuo, 55, on suspicion of embezzling \u00a32.4 million for luxuries such as racehorses named after his mistress. He is said to have plundered funds reserved for overseas trips by the Prime Minister. Papal tribute The Pope will today beatify a record 233 people, Roman Catholics who died in 1936 in Spain's Civil War at the hands of left-wing forces.",

Julian Joachim scored twice in the space of 18 minutes to overcome a first-half Alan Armstrong goal and take his own tally to five in six games, which must be worrying for Juan Pablo Angel, the \u00a310 million Colombian striker left on the substitutes' bench for the second game in succession. And with David Ginola starting his first game for two months, Villa's supporters finally had something to cheer as their side got the points that should erase any fears of being drawn into the relegation zone, although it took them a while to get going. Joachim almost made his tally three, and six in seven games, when he had another clear run on goal in the 85th minute, but he was denied his hat-trick by a perfectly timed tackle from Chris Makin, making his Ipswich debut after being signed from Sunderland this week. The final minutes brought the game's first caution - to that well-known clogger Ginola, for a foul on Fabian Wilnis - and a standing ovation for the French winger when he was substituted soon afterwards. Ginola saw plenty of the ball but struggled to make an impression the way he used to. Perhaps it was ring rust, or simply that at 34 he cannot go past defenders with the same ease. He still managed to swing in half-a-dozen crosses, but Joachim was nowhere near them and Dion Dublin was nowhere to be seen. Joachim unsettled the Ipswich defence with his pace and willingness to run at players, having a shot tipped away for a corner by Richard Wright in the 4th minute and setting up a chance for Lee Hendrie to have a similar shot deflected wide 10 minutes later.

      "body": "<p>It was late on Friday night when Tony Blair arrived at Chequers. Tired after a long day, he reflected on the speech he had just given in Inverness on the fight for the next election, on the strength of the economy, the health service and education. He knew hardly anybody would take any notice.</p> <p>In London, things were spinning out of control. The Hammond Inquiry report on the passport-for-favours scandal had created a storm of telephone calls and allegations that kept the Downing Street switchboard busy from 9.30am when the report was published.</p> <p>The Government stuck to one line, the classic 'blocking tactic' employed when an issue with explosive potential requires some answers. On Thursday afternoon Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, had telephoned No 10 from Belfast to say it was vital the agreed 'line to take' was stuck to. He had just had a lengthy meeting with Blair, who was at Hillsborough for talks on the peace process. That morning they had read and digested Sir Anthony's findings. Both men agreed they had 'to close the issue down'.</p> <p>Campbell told officials there was only one response to questions about how three very wealthy men had bought influence at the very heart of government: the report has cleared all involved of any impropriety. Yes, it was a tragedy Peter Mandelson had to resign but the inquiry's findings were clear. Let's move on.</p> <p>Campbell knew that on a superficial reading of the report the Downing Street line would hold. Journalists were given only 90 minutes to read the 116-page document before being summoned to a briefing by Godric Smith, Campbell's deputy. Mandelson acted honestly at all times and never had any intention to deceive anybody, the report said. The Home Office acted perfectly properly and gave no preferential treatment to the controversial Indian billionaires, the report said. There was no link between the offering of passports to the Hinduja brothers and a \u00a31 million donation to the Dome, the report said.</p> <p>But a close reading of the details reveals a different picture. Sir Anthony published 21 appendices to the report, letters, memos and emails that show the real way Government operates. It reveals a portrait of rich men dazzling politicians and gaining access to the heart of Whitehall. It reveals a story that has its roots in a short letter written by a middle-ranking civil servant 10 years ago. It reveals a way of operating that, whenever a light is shone on such dark corners, always comes to the same conclusion.</p> <p>The Government wants the public to know as little as possible about what it does and it will revert to seman tics, obsfuscation and omission to get its way. The Scott inquiry into arms to Iraq, the Phillips inquiry into BSE and the Hammond inquiry into passport for favours - one message is shared between all three. The public need not know what is done in its name.</p> <p>In the spring of 1991, Doug McQueen of the Government's Nationality Department dictated a letter to his secretary. He had been asked to adjudicate on the application of GP and SP Hinduja who had written to the Home Office a year earlier asking about British citizenship.</p> <p>'This submission recommends that we refuse [the] applications,' the letter said. The men had not satisfied the 'unwaivable requirement' of the British Nationality Act that they were in the country five years before their application. There was also a more serious problem. 'There must be some doubt in both cases as to whether they can be said to meet the requirement to be of good character,' McQueen wrote.</p> <p>He had more to say. 'The Hindujas have been pressing for their applications to be dealt with quickly because they are under investigation by the Indian authorities concerning the payments of excessive commissions on a contract for artillery by the previous Indian Government to the Swedish firm Bofors.' McQueen admitted the Bofors case was a 'major scandal' in India.</p> <p>'We have had to advise Ministers against accepting invitations from the brothers,' McQueen continued. Both Margaret Thatcher, the then Prime Minister, and David Waddington, the Home Secretary, had received invitations to a Diwali party hosted by the brothers. Both were told not to go.</p> <p>In conclusion, McQueen wrote: 'We do not usually grant citizenship to people who are known to be the subject of criminal investigation.' The Hindujas are still under criminal investigation and are on bail in India awaiting questioning. They now have British passports.</p> <p>Five years later GP Hinduja applied again. This time the British High Commission raised the issue of Bofors, saying the situation could become an embarrassment to the Government and the application should be treated 'unenthusiastically'.</p> <p>In November 1996 Caroline Elmes, of the South Asian Department in the Foreign Office, agreed. 'At the very least the Hinduja brothers can be said to have sailed close to the wind in building their business empire,' she said, warning that the Bofors case 'could come alight'.</p> <p>The case was being dealt with by Andrew Walmsley of the Immigration Directorate. He decided that such was the sensitivity of the case he would wait until after the election to put the matter to Ministers.</p> <p>On 3 July 1997, with a Labour Government in place, Walmsley put forward a submission to Home Office Minister Mike O'Brien recommending GP Hinduja's submission be granted, this time despite the issue of Bofors which was still being investigated. Although the Foreign Office had expressed concerns only a few months earlier, Walmsley did not check with them again. O'Brien agreed to the recommendation.</p> <p>It was the start of a pattern. GP Hinduja's passport application had been dealt with 'as a priority'. Why? Because he knew the right people. He had given a letter to Thatcher which had been passed on to the Home Office. Former Conservative leader Edward Heath had made inquiries on GP's behalf. Keith Vaz, then a backbench Labour MP, had also written letters. They had all been partied and wooed by the brothers. It got results because, as Hammond says, the more inquiries there are by prominent people, the quicker the Home Office operates, if only to stop the representations piling up.</p> <p>In the summer of 1998 SP Hinduja began inquiring about citizenship. Again the same methods were used, methods not open to people applying for passports but who cannot hold expensive parties and private dinners with the very powerful.</p> <p>Mandelson was contacted. Vaz was brought in again. SP received his passport in a quarter of the time it would normally take. The rules say an applicant must have been physically present in the country at the beginning of the five-year qualification period. This is 'unwaivable'. Yet in the case of SP Hinduja he would have had to have been in the UK on 22 October 1993, but Hammond finds that according to the records he was not in the UK between 15 September and 26 October. It also turns out that during this five year period SP Hinduja was out of the UK for 819 days, almost twice as long as is normally permitted.</p> <p>There were other favours. SP Hinduja was allowed to resubmit his original passport application form which had been rejected under the Tories. Hammond was told by a number of people in the Nationality Directorate in Liverpool that although this was lawful it was 'unusual'.</p> <p>I've just spoken to Peter Mandelson.' Matthew Laxton turned to his colleague with a look of surprise. One of the Government's most senior figures had just rung up inquiring about a certain SP Hinduja.</p> <p>It was June 1998 and Mandelson wanted to ask Laxton, O'Brien's assistant private secretary, if there was any point in SP Hinduja applying again for a passport. Mandelson was concerned because SP Hinduja had spent a lot of the time out of the country and he didn't want to be embarrassed by being turned down a second time. Mandelson's call produced a flurry of activity. It is remarkable what a 30-second conversation can achieve.</p> <p>Later that day O'Brien called his private secretary, Jon Payne, into his office and said he had received an inquiry from Mandelson about SP Hinduja. Payne told Hammond that O'Brien asked him to deal with Mandelson's inquiry 'sensitively and to ensure that he gave an accurate response'.</p> <p>At 11.20am on Thursday 2 July, Laxton emailed the Immigration and Nationality Directorate making clear O'Brien had a personal interest in the case of SP Hinduja and wanted to know whether he would benefit from a 'positive approach to citizenship'. It is undisputed that this email had been written as a result of the contact from Mandelson and his office.</p> <p>Laxton's email was received by Walmsley, who replied on 14 August that O'Brien should 'indicate to Mr Hinduja that we would be inclined to look favourably on his application'.</p> <p>On 5 October O'Brien wrote to Mandelson relaying the information. Sixteen days later, SP Hinduja re-applied for a passport, armed with interesting information from his friends in Government.</p> <p>Five miles away from the Home Office's ugly, concrete offices is the gleaming roof of the Dome. In the summer of 1998, 18 months before opening day, Jennie Page, chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company, was beginning to have jitters about the Hindujas who had pledged to underwrite the Faith Zone to the tune of \u00a33 million.</p> <p>She wanted checks on their background and financial status. On 3 November she sent a submission to Mandelson, now Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and in charge of the Dome. This included material from intelligence services reporting allegations the Hindujas were involved in 'improper, and is some cases criminal, behaviour'. She also prophetically warned there was a 'risk of adverse publicity if any of the various proceedings or inves tigations currently under way abroad were to become public, but on the balance the risk was worth taking'.</p> <p>Mandelson then writes back to Page saying: 'I agree that they are an above average risk but without firm evidence of wrongdoing how could we bar them from involvement in sponsorship?' He signs off with a revealing statement: 'Incidentally, if Mr S P Hinduja wished to pursue his citizenship application he can do so without further involvement or commendation from me!'</p> <p>Why, unprompted, did Mandelson talk about Hinduja's citizenship and why did he use the word 'commendation'. Hammond does not come up with any answers.</p> <p>Yet incredibly, despite knowing all this, 18 months later, after Mandelson returns to office following the home loan scandal, he is ready to help those he knows are alleged to be involved in 'criminal activities'.</p> <p>On 18 May last year Mandelson, now Northern Ireland Secretary, received a letter from GP Hinduja asking for 'help and advice' for a third Hinduja brother, Prakash, then living in Switzerland.</p> <p>The letter starts off: 'It has been a long time since we last met but I am following the progress in Northern Ireland with great interest.'</p> <p>Despite his brother not living in the UK, GP Hinduja tells Mandelson'the benefits he would bring as a UK citizen would far outweigh any hurdles that there might be'.</p> <p>The move set off chain reactions that raise awkward questions for the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, and show the donors to the Dome were able to pull important strings.</p> <p>Straw wrote a handwritten acknowledgment to Mandelson on 25 May, which said he was 'following the matter up personally and will be back in touch as soon as I can'. The letter was marked 'personal'.</p> <p>Straw also gave the letter to his private secretary, Dr Mara Goldstein, who sent an email with the Hinduja letter asking Walmsley to 'look at this request and provide advice as soon as possible and certainly by 15 June'.</p> <p>Having not heard from Walmsley by 31 May she telephoned him and spoke to one of his senior colleagues, Tony Dalton. Dalton took a message of this conversation and emailed this to Walmsley.</p> <p>This states: 'The Home Secretary would like the case to be dealt with \"helpfully\".' He said 'the case should be dealt with quickly'.</p> <p>Straw has argued that the word 'helpfully' meant properly and did not mean preferential treatment. Hammond, a Home Office barrister, accepts Straw's definition. Despite these interventions by two senior Ministers, Walmsley cannot help, because a key requirement for anybody wanting a British passport is that they live here. As Prakash Hinduja was a resident in Switzerland this was a problem and on 22 June Walmsley writes to Straw telling him.</p> <p>Four days later, Straw writes a letter to Mandelson telling him the situation. At the end is a handwritten note: 'I hope this is helpful. I'd be happy to have a further word with you.' Despite the evidence of high-level ministerial interventions, Hammond manages to conclude that 'no improper pressure was brought to bear by any Minister in respect of these applications'.</p> <p>Definition of the word 'representation' would not usually cause a crisis in Whitehall. Not unless the definition were being disputed by Peter Mandelson.</p> <p>On 18 December last year the Government had to answer a question from Norman Baker MP on 'what representations [the Home Office] has received on the applications by GP Hinduja and SP Hinduja for British citizenship from the Right Honourable Member for Hartlepool'.</p> <p>Walmsley drafted the reply. Although Mandelson had been in direct contact with O'Brien over SP Hinduja's application, Walmsley wrote in his first draft: 'No representations have been received concerning the application from the Right Honourable Member for Hartlepool'.</p> <p>This answer, given the contact between Mandelson and O'Brien and between the two men's offices, needed a Whitehall-esque view of the word 'representation'. Mandelson had made inquiries, but not representations, which suppose he was promoting one outcome over another. Straw said the answer could not stand, as it was not accurate. Although Mandelson tried to keep his name off the answer, he eventually agreed.</p> <p>Hammond ended up clearing everybody but, almost without knowing, revealed the way government works; the favours, personal notes and telephone calls that oil the wheels of power. How do those outside get access to those with the ability to guide events? By having money and through that, influence.</p> <p>'It is an irritant,' a Downing Street source admitted of the report. 'We just have to wait and see now if it goes away.'</p> <p><b> Call by call, how a career spiralled into crisis</b><br> <b> 28 June</b><br>Disputed phone call between Peter Mandelson and Immigration Minister Mike O'Brien.

He had just had a lengthy meeting with Blair, who was at Hillsborough for talks on the peace process. That morning they had read and digested Sir Anthony's findings. Both men agreed they had 'to close the issue down'. Campbell told officials there was only one response to questions about how three very wealthy men had bought influence at the very heart of government: the report has cleared all involved of any impropriety. Yes, it was a tragedy Peter Mandelson had to resign but the inquiry's findings were clear. Let's move on. Campbell knew that on a superficial reading of the report the Downing Street line would hold. Journalists were given only 90 minutes to read the 116-page document before being summoned to a briefing by Godric Smith, Campbell's deputy. Mandelson acted honestly at all times and never had any intention to deceive anybody, the report said. The Home Office acted perfectly properly and gave no preferential treatment to the controversial Indian billionaires, the report said. There was no link between the offering of passports to the Hinduja brothers and a \u00a31 million donation to the Dome, the report said. But a close reading of the details reveals a different picture. Sir Anthony published 21 appendices to the report, letters, memos and emails that show the real way Government operates. It reveals a portrait of rich men dazzling politicians and gaining access to the heart of Whitehall. It reveals a story that has its roots in a short letter written by a middle-ranking civil servant 10 years ago. It reveals a way of operating that, whenever a light is shone on such dark corners, always comes to the same conclusion. The Government wants the public to know as little as possible about what it does and it will revert to seman tics, obsfuscation and omission to get its way. The Scott inquiry into arms to Iraq, the Phillips inquiry into BSE and the Hammond inquiry into passport for favours - one message is shared between all three. The public need not know what is done in its name. In the spring of 1991, Doug McQueen of the Government's Nationality Department dictated a letter to his secretary. He had been asked to adjudicate on the application of GP and SP Hinduja who had written to the Home Office a year earlier asking about British citizenship. 'This submission recommends that we refuse [the] applications,' the letter said. The men had not satisfied the 'unwaivable requirement' of the British Nationality Act that they were in the country five years before their application. There was also a more serious problem. 'There must be some doubt in both cases as to whether they can be said to meet the requirement to be of good character,' McQueen wrote. He had more to say. 'The Hindujas have been pressing for their applications to be dealt with quickly because they are under investigation by the Indian authorities concerning the payments of excessive commissions on a contract for artillery by the previous Indian Government to the Swedish firm Bofors.' McQueen admitted the Bofors case was a 'major scandal' in India. 'We have had to advise Ministers against accepting invitations from the brothers,' McQueen continued. Both Margaret Thatcher, the then Prime Minister, and David Waddington, the Home Secretary, had received invitations to a Diwali party hosted by the brothers. Both were told not to go. In conclusion, McQueen wrote: 'We do not usually grant citizenship to people who are known to be the subject of criminal investigation.' The Hindujas are still under criminal investigation and are on bail in India awaiting questioning. They now have British passports. Five years later GP Hinduja applied again. This time the British High Commission raised the issue of Bofors, saying the situation could become an embarrassment to the Government and the application should be treated 'unenthusiastically'. In November 1996 Caroline Elmes, of the South Asian Department in the Foreign Office, agreed. 'At the very least the Hinduja brothers can be said to have sailed close to the wind in building their business empire,' she said, warning that the Bofors case 'could come alight'. The case was being dealt with by Andrew Walmsley of the Immigration Directorate. He decided that such was the sensitivity of the case he would wait until after the election to put the matter to Ministers. On 3 July 1997, with a Labour Government in place, Walmsley put forward a submission to Home Office Minister Mike O'Brien recommending GP Hinduja's submission be granted, this time despite the issue of Bofors which was still being investigated. Although the Foreign Office had expressed concerns only a few months earlier, Walmsley did not check with them again. O'Brien agreed to the recommendation. It was the start of a pattern. GP Hinduja's passport application had been dealt with 'as a priority'. Why? Because he knew the right people. He had given a letter to Thatcher which had been passed on to the Home Office. Former Conservative leader Edward Heath had made inquiries on GP's behalf. Keith Vaz, then a backbench Labour MP, had also written letters. They had all been partied and wooed by the brothers. It got results because, as Hammond says, the more inquiries there are by prominent people, the quicker the Home Office operates, if only to stop the representations piling up. In the summer of 1998 SP Hinduja began inquiring about citizenship. Again the same methods were used, methods not open to people applying for passports but who cannot hold expensive parties and private dinners with the very powerful. Mandelson was contacted. Vaz was brought in again. SP received his passport in a quarter of the time it would normally take. The rules say an applicant must have been physically present in the country at the beginning of the five-year qualification period. This is 'unwaivable'. Yet in the case of SP Hinduja he would have had to have been in the UK on 22 October 1993, but Hammond finds that according to the records he was not in the UK between 15 September and 26 October. It also turns out that during this five year period SP Hinduja was out of the UK for 819 days, almost twice as long as is normally permitted. There were other favours. SP Hinduja was allowed to resubmit his original passport application form which had been rejected under the Tories. Hammond was told by a number of people in the Nationality Directorate in Liverpool that although this was lawful it was 'unusual'. I've just spoken to Peter Mandelson.' Matthew Laxton turned to his colleague with a look of surprise. One of the Government's most senior figures had just rung up inquiring about a certain SP Hinduja. It was June 1998 and Mandelson wanted to ask Laxton, O'Brien's assistant private secretary, if there was any point in SP Hinduja applying again for a passport. Mandelson was concerned because SP Hinduja had spent a lot of the time out of the country and he didn't want to be embarrassed by being turned down a second time. Mandelson's call produced a flurry of activity. It is remarkable what a 30-second conversation can achieve. Later that day O'Brien called his private secretary, Jon Payne, into his office and said he had received an inquiry from Mandelson about SP Hinduja. Payne told Hammond that O'Brien asked him to deal with Mandelson's inquiry 'sensitively and to ensure that he gave an accurate response'. At 11.20am on Thursday 2 July, Laxton emailed the Immigration and Nationality Directorate making clear O'Brien had a personal interest in the case of SP Hinduja and wanted to know whether he would benefit from a 'positive approach to citizenship'. It is undisputed that this email had been written as a result of the contact from Mandelson and his office. Laxton's email was received by Walmsley, who replied on 14 August that O'Brien should 'indicate to Mr Hinduja that we would be inclined to look favourably on his application'. On 5 October O'Brien wrote to Mandelson relaying the information. Sixteen days later, SP Hinduja re-applied for a passport, armed with interesting information from his friends in Government. Five miles away from the Home Office's ugly, concrete offices is the gleaming roof of the Dome. In the summer of 1998, 18 months before opening day, Jennie Page, chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company, was beginning to have jitters about the Hindujas who had pledged to underwrite the Faith Zone to the tune of \u00a33 million. She wanted checks on their background and financial status. On 3 November she sent a submission to Mandelson, now Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and in charge of the Dome. This included material from intelligence services reporting allegations the Hindujas were involved in 'improper, and is some cases criminal, behaviour'. She also prophetically warned there was a 'risk of adverse publicity if any of the various proceedings or inves tigations currently under way abroad were to become public, but on the balance the risk was worth taking'. Mandelson then writes back to Page saying: 'I agree that they are an above average risk but without firm evidence of wrongdoing how could we bar them from involvement in sponsorship?' He signs off with a revealing statement: 'Incidentally, if Mr S P Hinduja wished to pursue his citizenship application he can do so without further involvement or commendation from me!' Why, unprompted, did Mandelson talk about Hinduja's citizenship and why did he use the word 'commendation'. Hammond does not come up with any answers. Yet incredibly, despite knowing all this, 18 months later, after Mandelson returns to office following the home loan scandal, he is ready to help those he knows are alleged to be involved in 'criminal activities'. On 18 May last year Mandelson, now Northern Ireland Secretary, received a letter from GP Hinduja asking for 'help and advice' for a third Hinduja brother, Prakash, then living in Switzerland. The letter starts off: 'It has been a long time since we last met but I am following the progress in Northern Ireland with great interest.' Despite his brother not living in the UK, GP Hinduja tells Mandelson'the benefits he would bring as a UK citizen would far outweigh any hurdles that there might be'. The move set off chain reactions that raise awkward questions for the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, and show the donors to the Dome were able to pull important strings. Straw wrote a handwritten acknowledgment to Mandelson on 25 May, which said he was 'following the matter up personally and will be back in touch as soon as I can'. The letter was marked 'personal'. Straw also gave the letter to his private secretary, Dr Mara Goldstein, who sent an email with the Hinduja letter asking Walmsley to 'look at this request and provide advice as soon as possible and certainly by 15 June'. Having not heard from Walmsley by 31 May she telephoned him and spoke to one of his senior colleagues, Tony Dalton. Dalton took a message of this conversation and emailed this to Walmsley. This states: 'The Home Secretary would like the case to be dealt with \"helpfully\".' He said 'the case should be dealt with quickly'. Straw has argued that the word 'helpfully' meant properly and did not mean preferential treatment. Hammond, a Home Office barrister, accepts Straw's definition. Despite these interventions by two senior Ministers, Walmsley cannot help, because a key requirement for anybody wanting a British passport is that they live here. As Prakash Hinduja was a resident in Switzerland this was a problem and on 22 June Walmsley writes to Straw telling him. Four days later, Straw writes a letter to Mandelson telling him the situation. At the end is a handwritten note: 'I hope this is helpful. I'd be happy to have a further word with you.' Despite the evidence of high-level ministerial interventions, Hammond manages to conclude that 'no improper pressure was brought to bear by any Minister in respect of these applications'. Definition of the word 'representation' would not usually cause a crisis in Whitehall. Not unless the definition were being disputed by Peter Mandelson. On 18 December last year the Government had to answer a question from Norman Baker MP on 'what representations [the Home Office] has received on the applications by GP Hinduja and SP Hinduja for British citizenship from the Right Honourable Member for Hartlepool'. Walmsley drafted the reply. Although Mandelson had been in direct contact with O'Brien over SP Hinduja's application, Walmsley wrote in his first draft: 'No representations have been received concerning the application from the Right Honourable Member for Hartlepool'. This answer, given the contact between Mandelson and O'Brien and between the two men's offices, needed a Whitehall-esque view of the word 'representation'. Mandelson had made inquiries, but not representations, which suppose he was promoting one outcome over another. Straw said the answer could not stand, as it was not accurate. Although Mandelson tried to keep his name off the answer, he eventually agreed. Hammond ended up clearing everybody but, almost without knowing, revealed the way government works; the favours, personal notes and telephone calls that oil the wheels of power. How do those outside get access to those with the ability to guide events? By having money and through that, influence. 'It is an irritant,' a Downing Street source admitted of the report. 'We just have to wait and see now if it goes away.' Call by call, how a career spiralled into crisis 28 June Disputed phone call between Peter Mandelson and Immigration Minister Mike O'Brien. O'Brien says Mandelson wanted to know how Srichand Hinduja's passport application would be viewed. O'Brien scribbles notes on a yellow Post-It. Mandelson claims he cannot remember the call. 16 January Jack Straw phones Mandelson to discuss Norman Baker's parliamentary question. Straw insists the answer to the question has to be as accurate and complete as possible. 22 January As a result Campbell gives an inaccurate briefing to journalists. 21 January: Hours after The Observer breaks the story of Mandelson's involvement in the Hinduja passport affair, Campbell phones Mandelson. No mention is made by Mandelson of earlier calls to Straw... 24 January The fateful meeting in Downing Street with Blair, Campbell and Cabinet Secretary Sir Richard Wilson. Blair insists Mandelson must go.

      "body": "<p>When Paul McCartney was a boy - before the Quarrymen, before the Moondogs, before the Beatles, before Beatlemania - he wrote a poem for his school magazine. 'Something deep and meaningful.' It was turned down, which rankled - after all, he likes, as he says to me laconically, 'to do things well'. He sits opposite me, in his security-frantic Soho office (Beatles memorabilia everywhere, and a de Kooning painting over his sleek desk), with his absurdly familiar pouchy, pixie face; so familiar I can't really see him. There's a kind of fame that is like a mask - so visible that it's invisible. </p> <p>He is amiable but wary. He doesn't want to talk about Linda, the pain or the recovery, or Heather Mills, the new light in his life after the other, blazing light went out, or family feuds, or long long ago, when he became an icon and then had to live with it for the rest of his time. He doesn't want to talk about noisy, legendary, epic things, rake over the things we all know and love to hear again and again, he wants to talk about these new poems, lying on the table between us: short lines of loss, love and wordplay. </p> <p>So then, for a long time after that early rejection, he didn't write another poem. Things got in the way, he says - those songs that poured out of him so he didn't really know where they were coming from. That life which we all read about, watched, absorbed into our own lives. Then, many years later a childhood friend of his, Ivan Vaughan, died and he found himself writing a kind of elegy to him. Sometimes, he says, 'poetry can be a deeper expression of what you feel'. 'Ivan' is rhythmic and staccato; it has a jaunty kind of melancholy to it. You can imagine it as a song lyric, something in the minor key. One of the formative moments of music history is smuggled into its middle lines, like a wink: 'He introduced to me / At Woolton fete / A pal or two / And so we did.' The pal of course, was John Lennon. </p> <p>'Linda encouraged me to write poems,' McCartney continues. 'After Ivan, I did a few more,' some emotional and some jests; imagistic fragments. They talked about the idea of a book with the poet Adrian Mitchell, whose own reading performances they had backed. 'A book for Paul'. 'Yeah. I quite liked the \"slim volume\" idea, you know, wouldn't it be nice, a slim volume of poetry, something to talk about at parties.' </p> <p>Then, after Linda died, closing their long and passionately close marriage, he wrote poetry in her memory, 'poetry out of grief and deep emotion'. Some of those poems are in Paul McCartney's new book, outpourings of the heart, elegiac love songs and prayers to God. They sit alongside some of the most famous lyrics in the world, since Mitchell persuaded him to gather the past and the present together under the simple title Blackbird Singing: Poems and Lyrics 1965-1999 (it's not, he says, meant to look like an epitaph on a tombstone; he's not dead yet). </p> <p>Recent poems are sandwiched between 'Yesterday' and 'Hey Jude'. It's the first time he has allowed his old songs to be reproduced like this: 'They look a bit naked, don't they?' And perhaps this marks his growing acceptance of his mythological past, a willingness to embrace what he for many years turned away from. The recent Anthologies, the return last year to the Cavern in Liverpool where he began, and now this splicing together of the Sixties with the rest of his life suggest a moving out of the extraordinary and intimidating shadow. </p> <p>For a time, he agrees, it was 'Get Thee Behind Me Beatles!' - which of course was impossible, since the public's love of the Beatles has never died down, and when the Anthologies were released, they rocketed once more to the top of the charts, as if 35 years had not intervened. He cannot begin to compete with the legend that he once was. Nothing he has written since the Beatles can compare with the beauty of 'Yesterday', which 'came to me like a dream, and I didn't know how it happened'. </p> <p>No collaboration comes close, creatively, to the face-to-face compositions of Lennon-McCartney. But he still, he says, writes 'mystically', with the same faith that if he listens to what is inside him he will be able to capture it and that it will mean something. He believes, endearingly, that music and words flow through other people, but they don't know how to get it down. He seems proud of the fact that he has never taken formal lessons - not in music ('though I tried'), not in painting, not in poetry-writing. He sits at a keyboard and lets his fingers take him; he listens to the stream of consciousness in his head and his poems 'come to me'. 'Creativity is \"a matter of wonder\", it takes me by surprise, hopefully. That's the thrill. Every time is still as fresh as the last time I did it and the first time I did it. I am,' he adds, 'addicted to it. I'm not a chocaholic but I'm some sort of an -aholic.' </p> <p>McCartney knows that every time he does something like this volume of poetry - or his recent exhibition of painting, which he 'went at with a vengeance' - then he is 'putting myself on the line'. But then, all his life he says, 'I've been putting myself on the line. It's not a conscious thing. It's partly because I'm conspicuous. And I like a lot of things. It can get a bit (he wrinkles his nose) embarrassing, liking a lot of things. I'm intelligent enough to know that it's more cool to focus on one thing and do that really well. But I'm an enthusiast. It's more positive to do it than not to do it. I never much liked authority. I didn't like school teachers or critics telling me what I could do. Or myself telling me. I'm alive - do it! It's like that line in 'Hey Jude'. You know that song?' I nod. 'Well, how does it go?' I refrain from prompting him, and he finds the song in his book: \"Yes, this: for well you know that it's a fool / That plays it cool / By making the world a little bit colder\". That sums me up to some extent.' </p> <p>It's interesting that he quotes himself to explain himself, dipping into the compendious anthology and feeding off lines he wrote long ago. Many of the lyrics he wrote in the past were born out of his own life and then appropriated by all of us, to describe our growing pains; Penny Lane and the bric-a-brac of childhood is ours too, now. He gave it to us. What was particular for him became universal; his heartbreak became ours. We sing his words, hum his tunes, have opinions on the Fab Four (who was your favourite Beatle?), the bitter break-up, his faithful marriage, his shaky, on-off, determined post-Beatles career. </p> <p>So I ask him if it's hard, now, to belong to himself, disentangle the legend from the private man. 'I'm not sure I do feel I belong to myself,' he replies, abruptly. Then, after a pause, he says: 'There are two sides to me. I'm a Gemini, you know? I'm very conscious of my duality in lots of ways, sort of like a split personality. Well, that's a human condition, isn't it, though? Everyone has a conscience, a voice inside their heads. Anyway, I'm very conscious of that debate between the two of us. Like (he half chants this bit) black/white, day/night, dull/bright. They all happen to rhyme by the way. So there are two of us.' </p> <p>There's him, and he walks down the streets and goes into shops and is very famous. And there's the other one, who loves, laughs, cries, remembers, plans. 'That's just me. It's always been me, since the age of five. I compartmentalise the famous side. And I'm very happy to do that. It doesn't bother me.' </p> <p>He says that when the Beatles started to get famous, he used to go to Greece on holidays, and nobody knew who he was. 'I used to say to the hotel band, \"Back home, I'm pretty famous\", and they'd go, \"Oh yeah, pull the other one\". So I decided Greece would always be my bolt hole. Then one day someone said, \"But you're massive in Greece\". Shit, I thought. Shit. There goes my bolt hole. So I had to make a decision: did I want to be famous or change things. I wanted to continue, so I might as well get happy with the situation. I make a point of enjoying it. I have my private life. I guard it fiercely.' </p> <p>He doesn't want to, won't, talk about 'Paul after Linda' (he uses a mock syrupy voice here, and lambasts newspapers for the way they make glib headlines out of his love life and his grief). He often hates interviews, for the way they twist his words. It's a strange business, he says, talking about yourself. </p> <p>When people call him (or his younger self) a genius, he says that 'that is embarrassing. I don't need to go there. I get a bit uncomfortable when people start doing that - I mean I like it, but it's embarrassing really. I like some of the stuff I've done. Sometimes I do look at it still, and I think: \"Bloody hell!\" - and then I look away again. I don't want to look too closely.' </p> <p>People have called him big-headed, and he admits that he can be 'kind of conceited - I mean, how can you say that the Lennon-McCartney stuff isn't good? I'm very ambitious. If I do things, I want to do them well. With Lennon-McCartney, there's a body of work, like Picasso - and it can be judged. There will be no more of it, and I can say what I think of it now, and it was damned good.' For a moment, he sounds in awe of himself. 'And I'm not alone in thinking that I feel a little easier there, because John's in there too. I don't like big heads, but it's hard to be humble when you're as great as I am.' He gestures wildly towards me with a forefinger: 'That's the title of a country and western song you know! I didn't make it up.' </p> <p> 'I am normal,' he says. 'I am extremely normal. Anyone who gets to know me knows what I mean. If you knew me, you'd like me.' He give a slightly nervous chuckle. </p> <p>Paul McCartney has often been described as someone who likes too much to be liked. While Lennon was bolshy and bumpy and disagreeable (and therefore, ironically, easier for people to idolise, 'arty' not just 'nice'); he was sweeter and smoother, in life as in work, open to the charge of being insecurely 'charming'. 'Most people like to be liked,' he says reasonably. 'I don't crave it. I just prefer it. Look, where I come from, we're the grovelling type. We tend to doff our caps. I set out to try and do good. When I was a kid I wanted my friends to like me. You want to have mates. You don't want to be the one in the corner that everyone spits at, do you? I wanted to earn money, the more the better. No one wants to earn less,do they? When I got into songs, with the Beatles, I wanted to write the best songs in the world. Just that.' Just. How the everyday rubs up against the glory. </p> <p>When Linda died, he cried for a year, and he wrote poems for her, about her, to her. 'She's still there,' he says. 'She always will be. But they say that time is a healer, and it is. It heals by erasure. It erases the awful feelings. Grief is numbed and eased. Not the memories, but the pain, is rubbed out a bit. And that has to be a good thing. Otherwise you'd never be able to get on with life. </p> <p>'My mum died when I was 14. I can't recall her face now. It's like a law of nature - a good one really. You could go mad. There are people who do that - sit in a room full of photos, remembering. Well, the poems were therapeutic for me. I could remember and forget at the same time. Remember by recording the feelings; forget by releasing the feelings.' He grimaces briefly. 'To some degree,' he adds. </p> <p>In five years, Paul McCartney will be 64. But he still feels close, he says, to the boy he was before he became famous - that 'grovelling type', who doffs his cap; that insecure child who lost his mother early. 'I haven't changed that much,' he says. 'I'm just more puzzled. Don't we all get more puzzled as we get older? When you're young, you think you know what it's all about. When you get older, you see more. And things go faster. I don't mind being puzzled really.' </p> <p>When I leave him, I want to say that I can't think of anyone alive who has given as much pleasure as he has. </p> <p><strong>McCartney's favourite self-penned poem</strong></p> <p> <strong>Her Spirit</strong><br> Her spirit moves wind chimes<br> When the air is still<br> And fills the room<br> With fragrance of lily<br></p> <p>Her eyes blue green<br> Still seem<br> Perfectly happy<br> With nothing<br></p> <p>Her spirit sets<br> The water pipes a-humming<br> Fat lektronic forces be with ya sound<br></p> <p>Her spirit talks to me <br> Through animals<br> Beautiful creatures <br> Lay with me<br></p> <p>Bird that calls my name<br> Insist that she is here<br> And nothing <br> Left to fear</p> <p> Bright white squirrel<br> Foot of tree<br> Faces me<br> With innocent gaze</p> <p>Her spirit talks to me</p> <p> \u0095 Blackbird Singing by Paul McCartney is published by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a314.99</p>",

He doesn't want to talk about Linda, the pain or the recovery, or Heather Mills, the new light in his life after the other, blazing light went out, or family feuds, or long long ago, when he became an icon and then had to live with it for the rest of his time. He doesn't want to talk about noisy, legendary, epic things, rake over the things we all know and love to hear again and again, he wants to talk about these new poems, lying on the table between us: short lines of loss, love and wordplay. So then, for a long time after that early rejection, he didn't write another poem. Things got in the way, he says - those songs that poured out of him so he didn't really know where they were coming from. That life which we all read about, watched, absorbed into our own lives. Then, many years later a childhood friend of his, Ivan Vaughan, died and he found himself writing a kind of elegy to him. Sometimes, he says, 'poetry can be a deeper expression of what you feel'. 'Ivan' is rhythmic and staccato; it has a jaunty kind of melancholy to it. You can imagine it as a song lyric, something in the minor key. One of the formative moments of music history is smuggled into its middle lines, like a wink: 'He introduced to me / At Woolton fete / A pal or two / And so we did.' The pal of course, was John Lennon. 'Linda encouraged me to write poems,' McCartney continues. 'After Ivan, I did a few more,' some emotional and some jests; imagistic fragments. They talked about the idea of a book with the poet Adrian Mitchell, whose own reading performances they had backed. 'A book for Paul'. 'Yeah. I quite liked the \"slim volume\" idea, you know, wouldn't it be nice, a slim volume of poetry, something to talk about at parties.' Then, after Linda died, closing their long and passionately close marriage, he wrote poetry in her memory, 'poetry out of grief and deep emotion'. Some of those poems are in Paul McCartney's new book, outpourings of the heart, elegiac love songs and prayers to God. They sit alongside some of the most famous lyrics in the world, since Mitchell persuaded him to gather the past and the present together under the simple title Blackbird Singing: Poems and Lyrics 1965-1999 (it's not, he says, meant to look like an epitaph on a tombstone; he's not dead yet). Recent poems are sandwiched between 'Yesterday' and 'Hey Jude'. It's the first time he has allowed his old songs to be reproduced like this: 'They look a bit naked, don't they?' And perhaps this marks his growing acceptance of his mythological past, a willingness to embrace what he for many years turned away from. The recent Anthologies, the return last year to the Cavern in Liverpool where he began, and now this splicing together of the Sixties with the rest of his life suggest a moving out of the extraordinary and intimidating shadow. For a time, he agrees, it was 'Get Thee Behind Me Beatles!' - which of course was impossible, since the public's love of the Beatles has never died down, and when the Anthologies were released, they rocketed once more to the top of the charts, as if 35 years had not intervened. He cannot begin to compete with the legend that he once was. Nothing he has written since the Beatles can compare with the beauty of 'Yesterday', which 'came to me like a dream, and I didn't know how it happened'. No collaboration comes close, creatively, to the face-to-face compositions of Lennon-McCartney. But he still, he says, writes 'mystically', with the same faith that if he listens to what is inside him he will be able to capture it and that it will mean something. He believes, endearingly, that music and words flow through other people, but they don't know how to get it down. He seems proud of the fact that he has never taken formal lessons - not in music ('though I tried'), not in painting, not in poetry-writing. He sits at a keyboard and lets his fingers take him; he listens to the stream of consciousness in his head and his poems 'come to me'. 'Creativity is \"a matter of wonder\", it takes me by surprise, hopefully. That's the thrill. Every time is still as fresh as the last time I did it and the first time I did it. I am,' he adds, 'addicted to it. I'm not a chocaholic but I'm some sort of an -aholic.' McCartney knows that every time he does something like this volume of poetry - or his recent exhibition of painting, which he 'went at with a vengeance' - then he is 'putting myself on the line'. But then, all his life he says, 'I've been putting myself on the line. It's not a conscious thing. It's partly because I'm conspicuous. And I like a lot of things. It can get a bit (he wrinkles his nose) embarrassing, liking a lot of things. I'm intelligent enough to know that it's more cool to focus on one thing and do that really well. But I'm an enthusiast. It's more positive to do it than not to do it. I never much liked authority. I didn't like school teachers or critics telling me what I could do. Or myself telling me. I'm alive - do it! It's like that line in 'Hey Jude'. You know that song?' I nod. 'Well, how does it go?' I refrain from prompting him, and he finds the song in his book: \"Yes, this: for well you know that it's a fool / That plays it cool / By making the world a little bit colder\". That sums me up to some extent.' It's interesting that he quotes himself to explain himself, dipping into the compendious anthology and feeding off lines he wrote long ago. Many of the lyrics he wrote in the past were born out of his own life and then appropriated by all of us, to describe our growing pains; Penny Lane and the bric-a-brac of childhood is ours too, now. He gave it to us. What was particular for him became universal; his heartbreak became ours. We sing his words, hum his tunes, have opinions on the Fab Four (who was your favourite Beatle?), the bitter break-up, his faithful marriage, his shaky, on-off, determined post-Beatles career. So I ask him if it's hard, now, to belong to himself, disentangle the legend from the private man. 'I'm not sure I do feel I belong to myself,' he replies, abruptly. Then, after a pause, he says: 'There are two sides to me. I'm a Gemini, you know? I'm very conscious of my duality in lots of ways, sort of like a split personality. Well, that's a human condition, isn't it, though? Everyone has a conscience, a voice inside their heads. Anyway, I'm very conscious of that debate between the two of us. Like (he half chants this bit) black/white, day/night, dull/bright. They all happen to rhyme by the way. So there are two of us.' There's him, and he walks down the streets and goes into shops and is very famous. And there's the other one, who loves, laughs, cries, remembers, plans. 'That's just me. It's always been me, since the age of five. I compartmentalise the famous side. And I'm very happy to do that. It doesn't bother me.' He says that when the Beatles started to get famous, he used to go to Greece on holidays, and nobody knew who he was. 'I used to say to the hotel band, \"Back home, I'm pretty famous\", and they'd go, \"Oh yeah, pull the other one\". So I decided Greece would always be my bolt hole. Then one day someone said, \"But you're massive in Greece\". Shit, I thought. Shit. There goes my bolt hole. So I had to make a decision: did I want to be famous or change things. I wanted to continue, so I might as well get happy with the situation. I make a point of enjoying it. I have my private life. I guard it fiercely.' He doesn't want to, won't, talk about 'Paul after Linda' (he uses a mock syrupy voice here, and lambasts newspapers for the way they make glib headlines out of his love life and his grief). He often hates interviews, for the way they twist his words. It's a strange business, he says, talking about yourself. When people call him (or his younger self) a genius, he says that 'that is embarrassing. I don't need to go there. I get a bit uncomfortable when people start doing that - I mean I like it, but it's embarrassing really. I like some of the stuff I've done. Sometimes I do look at it still, and I think: \"Bloody hell!\" - and then I look away again. I don't want to look too closely.' People have called him big-headed, and he admits that he can be 'kind of conceited - I mean, how can you say that the Lennon-McCartney stuff isn't good? I'm very ambitious. If I do things, I want to do them well. With Lennon-McCartney, there's a body of work, like Picasso - and it can be judged. There will be no more of it, and I can say what I think of it now, and it was damned good.' For a moment, he sounds in awe of himself. 'And I'm not alone in thinking that I feel a little easier there, because John's in there too. I don't like big heads, but it's hard to be humble when you're as great as I am.' He gestures wildly towards me with a forefinger: 'That's the title of a country and western song you know! I didn't make it up.' 'I am normal,' he says. 'I am extremely normal. Anyone who gets to know me knows what I mean. If you knew me, you'd like me.' He give a slightly nervous chuckle. Paul McCartney has often been described as someone who likes too much to be liked. While Lennon was bolshy and bumpy and disagreeable (and therefore, ironically, easier for people to idolise, 'arty' not just 'nice'); he was sweeter and smoother, in life as in work, open to the charge of being insecurely 'charming'. 'Most people like to be liked,' he says reasonably. 'I don't crave it. I just prefer it. Look, where I come from, we're the grovelling type. We tend to doff our caps. I set out to try and do good. When I was a kid I wanted my friends to like me. You want to have mates. You don't want to be the one in the corner that everyone spits at, do you? I wanted to earn money, the more the better. No one wants to earn less,do they? When I got into songs, with the Beatles, I wanted to write the best songs in the world. Just that.' Just. How the everyday rubs up against the glory. When Linda died, he cried for a year, and he wrote poems for her, about her, to her. 'She's still there,' he says. 'She always will be. But they say that time is a healer, and it is. It heals by erasure. It erases the awful feelings. Grief is numbed and eased. Not the memories, but the pain, is rubbed out a bit. And that has to be a good thing. Otherwise you'd never be able to get on with life. 'My mum died when I was 14. I can't recall her face now. It's like a law of nature - a good one really. You could go mad. There are people who do that - sit in a room full of photos, remembering. Well, the poems were therapeutic for me. I could remember and forget at the same time. Remember by recording the feelings; forget by releasing the feelings.' He grimaces briefly. 'To some degree,' he adds. In five years, Paul McCartney will be 64. But he still feels close, he says, to the boy he was before he became famous - that 'grovelling type', who doffs his cap; that insecure child who lost his mother early. 'I haven't changed that much,' he says. 'I'm just more puzzled. Don't we all get more puzzled as we get older? When you're young, you think you know what it's all about. When you get older, you see more. And things go faster. I don't mind being puzzled really.' When I leave him, I want to say that I can't think of anyone alive who has given as much pleasure as he has. McCartney's favourite self-penned poem Her Spirit Her spirit moves wind chimes When the air is still And fills the room With fragrance of lily Her eyes blue green Still seem Perfectly happy With nothing Her spirit sets The water pipes a-humming Fat lektronic forces be with ya sound Her spirit talks to me Through animals Beautiful creatures Lay with me Bird that calls my name Insist that she is here And nothing Left to fear Bright white squirrel Foot of tree Faces me With innocent gaze Her spirit talks to me \u0095 Blackbird Singing by Paul McCartney is published by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a314.99",
