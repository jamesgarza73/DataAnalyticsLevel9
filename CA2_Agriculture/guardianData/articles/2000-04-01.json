Over the past few years, there has been an enormous amount of attention given to what a father means in the contemporary world, where all roles are up for grabs. But the word 'mother' still carries its ancient thrill. There may be thousands of ways of being a mother, but there's still only one dominant way of perceiving her. And as the psychoanalyst and writer Adam Phillips says, mothers are 'caught in the crossfire between their own experiences - of being a mother, of having a mother - and what society is telling them; all those images and demands'. </p> <p>In an experiment in the 1950s, baby chimpanzees were taken from their mother at birth. In her place, they were given a round, soft object embedded with spikes. The baby chimps would hold on to it, no matter how sharply they were pricked. When soldiers die in battle, they often cry out for their mothers; at a deathbed, the person most often invoked is Mother. The image of the mother is cradled deep in our unconscious. It's the Madonna - the self-effaced purity of the tender woman who gives birth to the future. It's the piet\u00e0- the same virgin, holding her son dead at her breast and made up entirely of sorrow. It's the woman who kisses her child goodnight and sings a lullaby as her baby slides into dreams. The woman who is there as the child grows - baking cakes, washing clothes, putting plasters on knees, who hears the first word, crows over the first steps, who teaches it how to read, to learn the world. </p> <p>Ah, mother: beatific, saintly, sweet, self-denying, dolorous, invisible. Not cross, not impatient, not full of desire and fear, ambition, jealousy, rage and thwarted hopes. Not us, then. Against this picture of the ideal mother, we are bound to fail. And if there are dominant cultural images of the Good Mother, so are there for the Bad Mother. Rosemary West: the dumpy, motherly, meat-and-two veg woman who killed her children. DH Lawrence's mother figure, forever clinging, demanding and needy and deadly. The poor Home Alone mother. The Bad Mother is unnatural, monstrous. We fear her, for she lurks inside all of us.</p> <p>Many of our mothers, or the mothers of our mothers, did not have the choice we have. There was one way to be a mother, and if for some that was a joy, for others it was a prison. Women fought hard to get rid of the single-track approach to parenthood. Now we've got the spaghetti junction instead: you can (with much luck and a following wind) be a mother and pursue your career; you can be a mother and work part-time; you can be a mother full-time and put your work on hold; you can be a mother and wear skimpy clothes and be sexy; you can be a mother young or older, with a partner or single, with different fathers. You can have one child, two, four... You can be a 'modern' kind of mother, or a 'traditional' one, or choose not to be one at all. </p> <p>'There is a way in which the child invents the mother,' says Adam Phillips. 'There's a very powerful feedback loop. There is no fixed personality called \"mother\", no fixed personality called \"child\". Motherhood is a process.' Maureen Freely, author of two books about parenthood, says that one of the things that opened up the subject of motherhood for her was a book by the American writer Sarah Ruddick, who said that 'mother' was a verb, not a noun. 'There's this idea that you can't do, you can only be. Other people decide if you're good.' Actually, she says, 'motherhood is a practice - like medicine, or philosophy'. Freely says 'we should stop worrying about what we are and think more about what we do. I haven't met a mother yet who's not guilty about something.'</p> <p>We should stop thinking about Good Mothers and Bad Mothers. Mostly we do our best, and fail and succeed all at the same time. In the rich mess and scary muddle of now, there are lots of ways of doing good mothering. Adam Phillips says: 'It is fraught, excessive, very hard to sort out. It drives people mad.' But don't go mad. Don't be consumed by guilt for all those things you did, and regret for all the things you failed to do. </p> <p>Child, or mother, or both: have a happy Mother's Day.</p> <p><strong> The motherless child</strong> <br> Peter has grown up without a mother, and in his adulthood became the mothering figure. His story - told with no self-pity - is about loss and the search for love. He has a fugitive half-memory, one which he doesn't trust, of holding the hand of someone called Mummy, a dark solid shape beside him. But he grew up motherless, parentless, and with no sense of his own past. </p> <p>'Among happy families, I was an outcast. I always felt that. My memories start when I was four and a half. My elder brother and I were rescued by an elderly couple, who fostered us. We were like their project. I spent 10 years with them. I called them Mum and Dad. They changed my name - not just my last name, but my first. I think my story is really all about names. </p> <p>'But puberty was hard for them, not Robert Louis Stevenson any more, but appetites. When I was 13, they sent me to boarding school, and a year and a half later, when I was suspended, they didn't take me back. They had that choice, because they weren't my \"real\" parents, you see. They didn't take me home because they retained the right not to be Mum and Dad. That's the safety valve for foster parents - though it only works one way.' </p> <p>Peter, in London - alone, confused, a 'teenage hybrid' adrift - traced his father, changed his name once again, met the man he had longed for ('My first thought was: you're not him'), and found also that he had a sister. He wanted, desperately, to know something about his mother. 'Just a photo, anything.' His father kept telling him he was better off not knowing - 'He told me she was a bad mother.' </p> <p>Then Peter, still a teenager, 'met someone. We had a child when I was 19. Then another. She left. I brought them up.' Sometimes it was hard, but 'I was utterly ripe to be devoted; to be a mother - to be the mother I hadn't had.' He thinks, like Maureen Freely, that 'mother' is a verb, an activity, something that you do. He says, with a kind of gratitude, that 'without my childhood, I would probably not have had the opportunity or the inclination to bring up two children at the age of 20, and my wife may not have felt able to leave us, and I would have missed out on the opportunity on watching two extraordinary women grow'. </p> <p>At 30, as his children were becoming more independent, he went in search of his own mother and found out that his father - the one he had traced - wasn't his father after all; the name he had taken back in an effort to claim kinship didn't belong to him. His mother had been a waitress with a hard life and a string of men, who had abandoned him as a toddler. </p> <p>Peter eventually found his mother, 'and yes, I adored her, she was my Mum. God, of course I adored her. And yes, it was too late, because she was the one who needed looking after.' For the rest of her life, he would ring her every Saturday evening, the dutiful son. He felt no anger, because 'when you're left, you can't afford to feel anger. You have to bottle it up, or you'll not be loved. You have to smile.' Peter says, quite matter-of-factly, that in his life he has never been 'mothered. No one told me I'm OK.' </p> <p>Shortly after his mother died, Peter wrote this: 'For most of my life, the thought of Mum and mothering meant loss and pain, hurt. Mums were warm and safe, the kinds of people who cuddled you when you needed to feel safe. For me, Mum meant someone who couldn't love me, who abandoned me to be brought up by strangers, sometimes dangerous strangers who left me with rickets, starved of food and affection and light. Mum meant wondering why you were unloveable, what you had done to drive your mother away </p> <p>'You had somehow sacrificed the right to unconditional love. Love was something you had to earn, and keep earning, because it could be taken away, in anger, or because maybe you didn't fit in any more. You were born to be a Battersea dog, wagging your tail in a desperate attempt to be endearing. You learnt you were a child of an unnatural mother, one incapable of proper love, the wholesome, Christian kind of feeling</p> <p>'I met my mother at 30. We cried with relief that I didn't hate her. It was too little too late, but at last I knew the answers to some of the questions Now she's dead, and it's over, I am able to put down the burden of being abandoned. In her death, I briefly rediscovered room to breathe.' </p> <p> <strong> The non-working mother</strong> <br> Carrie Heler used to be a design editor. Her husband, Martyn Harris, was a writer. 'My career was very much part of my identity, and important in our relationship - it was good for me to be an individual, working on things outside the house, the family, us.' </p> <p>After their son Joe was born, Carrie went back to work, part-time - 'Martyn travelled a lot, so I had to be flexible.' Then, on Joe's fourth birthday, Martyn's cancer was diagnosed. 'I decided to give up work, and be around for Martyn and Joe - I thought they both needed a structure, domestic stability. That became my job: I needed to be the foundation, the rock, the Good Mother. For the last six months of Martyn's life, I did not work at all. Through all those horrendous hospital appointments, through all that time when Martyn was hurtling towards death, I was parking Joe with friends, colleagues, and I felt guilty about that - I still feel guilty about that. There is a lot of guilt in me. </p> <p>'After Martyn died, I felt I absolutely had to be there for Joe, to repair our relationship which, however I'd tried, had been coming second. Yet now - three years later - I'd like some kind of life outside this one. I think Joe needs that as well - to respect me outside this role of mother and be able to say, \"My mum does that\" and feel proud of me. I need to have self-esteem, a sense of who I am; during all those years, I almost lost that. </p> <p>'Whatever you do, you are haunted by the alternatives. If I worked now, it would be for my benefit and for his, because I am his mother but I also stand in for his father. </p> <p>'I read a poem once, which said that being a mother was like being a bow. The child is the arrow. A bow has to be strong and resilient and flexible. I try' </p> <p> <strong> The childless mother</strong> </p> <p> Joan Smith is a writer and a journalist. She has made a positive choice not to have children. She agrees that one way of being a Bad Mother is to choose not to be one at all. 'What lies at the heart of this is that the way we think of women as mothers doesn't allow women to be different from each other. For centuries, women didn't really have a choice - if they were sexually active, and most of them were, then they would become mothers. The fact that every woman, more or less, did it blinded us to the fact that they might not be choosing to do it. Now, in the UK and western Europe, about 20 per cent of women are actively choosing not to be mothers. </p> <p>'I don't find this so surprising. I grew up with the pill. I came from a working-class family, an only child. My father was a working-class autodidact and he wanted me to go to university, and I guess I was brought up in quite an ungendered way. There were millions of things I could do with my life, and to be a mother was just one of them. I never enjoyed being around children that much; I didn't want to look after them, and I saw lots of girls on the estate where I lived who got pregnant at 15 or 16. They were barely adults, and it seemed to me that they never left the world of childhood. That wasn't for me. I always had a powerful sense of my identity and also I had quite a tortured relationship with my own mother. I looked around and saw women left high and dry when their children left home. </p> <p>'There was no real heart-searching about not having children, no regrets. My choice apparently puts me in a hostile camp - there is the assumption that women have to be mothers, and this is a stick that beats all women, with or without children. Are women allowed to be different? Men are. No one criticises men for not becoming fathers, like the bishop who attacked women for remaining childless. No one feels sorry for Leonardo da Vinci for having no children, but they do say, \"Poor virgin Queen Elizabeth\". The discourse is changing now. Ten years ago, when I wrote about my choice, I got torrents of hostile mail: \"I'm a grandmother, and when I die I'll have my children and grandchildren round my bed, and you'll just have your PC.\" </p> <p>'The torrent of abuse that women get as mothers is the same as the torrents of abuse women get for not being mothers. People are often insecure; they don't see difference as interesting. They react with hostility. I always think the only way it is possible to be a good mother is to be a Catholic with six children, and dying but choosing to have the seventh. Actually, come to think of it, the only good mother is the dead mother. Like the saying goes: good girls go to heaven. Bad girls go everywhere.' </p> <p> <strong> The motherless mother</strong> </p> <p> Dorothy's mother died when she was 11, just entering that strange land between childhood and adulthood. She is now a mother herself. 'When I was a little girl, my mother was just there, and I didn't think about what she meant. She gradually got iller and iller - she had a brain tumour - but I still didn't notice this until it embarrassed me. She was staggering about, peering at things. The illness affected her balance, and her vision, and seemed to distort her mind, too. One of the things that I found very hard to deal with later was when her brother, to whom she had been very close, said to me that of course I never really knew her as she really was, before. To me, she was just Mum, and he was taking her away from me all over again. </p> <p>'So much has been mythologised about her. She was an unusual woman, and she dealt with her illness in an unusual way, soldiering on, seeing the humour in it. A lot of people adored her. Afterwards they told me stories about her, which I wasn't ready for. In lots of ways, I lost her over and over again after she died. It was five years before I really believed she had died. She was this living, pulsating thing inside me - she was there. That's what a guardian angel is, I suppose. A child doesn't let go until it is ready. She's still here, but she's not my heart any longer, not the thing that keeps me breathing. </p> <p>'I relinquished her in all sorts of ways. It took a long time before I dared be a mother myself. Despite everything, I found that I had to be a mother - and when I had my own children, I found her again. I wrote a lot about her. I knew how present she was for a lot of us - even those who had never known her - and I interviewed family members about how they felt about living with a dead person. I've always had problems of scale with my mother - when I was a child, she was God, enormous. Later, she became this tiny figure in my mind, hardened with age. Now, I can see her. I talk to her. </p> <p>'But as a mother, I have to work. I am away from my children more than I want, and that makes me feel cut off from my self. I am absent. There are times when I feel I cannot bear it. I cannot bear it.' </p> <p> <strong> The working mother</strong> <br> Claire is a mother of two. For the first few years of her children's lives, she had a demanding job in management. 'I'd see them in the mornings, when I was often frazzled, but not at night. I could never get home until eight; they'd be in bed by 7.30pm. While I was at work, I felt fine - I think, like many people, I am capable of having two separate lives. But in the long term, I was acutely aware I was spending too much time at work. </p> <p>'It's important to work out how much you mind not being the primary carer - my children had consistent childcare, and their father was around a lot. I was third in line. I was the husband, if you like, and the father was the mother. The eldest became quite hostile to me. He wouldn't let me do things for him. It wasn't me he called out for in the night. </p> <p>'It's complicated, motherhood, and my feelings about it. I was at boarding school from the age of seven - until then, my mother was the primary carer. Maybe being sent away made it easier for me to break the mould. Yet when my eldest child was seven, I had the strongest sense of a generation coming full circle, and I couldn't understand what it would mean to send your child away. </p> <p>'Now, I do much more parenting; I always knew I could only do a pressured job for a short time. I always had a sense that to keep going like that would be at the cost of my children. It's partly selfish: they were fine, but I wanted to be the person who was there for them. I wanted to be able to have my say in their lives, meet their friends, know about their days, be nurturing. And pass things on - mothering wisdom, the things my mother taught me, and her mother taught her. Like a baton, I want to hand them down. But you have to ask yourself: who needs who?'</p>",

No one feels sorry for Leonardo da Vinci for having no children, but they do say, \"Poor virgin Queen Elizabeth\". The discourse is changing now. Ten years ago, when I wrote about my choice, I got torrents of hostile mail: \"I'm a grandmother, and when I die I'll have my children and grandchildren round my bed, and you'll just have your PC.\" 'The torrent of abuse that women get as mothers is the same as the torrents of abuse women get for not being mothers. People are often insecure; they don't see difference as interesting. They react with hostility. I always think the only way it is possible to be a good mother is to be a Catholic with six children, and dying but choosing to have the seventh. Actually, come to think of it, the only good mother is the dead mother. Like the saying goes: good girls go to heaven. Bad girls go everywhere.' The motherless mother Dorothy's mother died when she was 11, just entering that strange land between childhood and adulthood. She is now a mother herself. 'When I was a little girl, my mother was just there, and I didn't think about what she meant. She gradually got iller and iller - she had a brain tumour - but I still didn't notice this until it embarrassed me. She was staggering about, peering at things. The illness affected her balance, and her vision, and seemed to distort her mind, too. One of the things that I found very hard to deal with later was when her brother, to whom she had been very close, said to me that of course I never really knew her as she really was, before. To me, she was just Mum, and he was taking her away from me all over again. 'So much has been mythologised about her. She was an unusual woman, and she dealt with her illness in an unusual way, soldiering on, seeing the humour in it. A lot of people adored her. Afterwards they told me stories about her, which I wasn't ready for. In lots of ways, I lost her over and over again after she died. It was five years before I really believed she had died. She was this living, pulsating thing inside me - she was there. That's what a guardian angel is, I suppose. A child doesn't let go until it is ready. She's still here, but she's not my heart any longer, not the thing that keeps me breathing. 'I relinquished her in all sorts of ways. It took a long time before I dared be a mother myself. Despite everything, I found that I had to be a mother - and when I had my own children, I found her again. I wrote a lot about her. I knew how present she was for a lot of us - even those who had never known her - and I interviewed family members about how they felt about living with a dead person. I've always had problems of scale with my mother - when I was a child, she was God, enormous. Later, she became this tiny figure in my mind, hardened with age. Now, I can see her. I talk to her. 'But as a mother, I have to work. I am away from my children more than I want, and that makes me feel cut off from my self. I am absent. There are times when I feel I cannot bear it. I cannot bear it.' The working mother Claire is a mother of two. For the first few years of her children's lives, she had a demanding job in management. 'I'd see them in the mornings, when I was often frazzled, but not at night. I could never get home until eight; they'd be in bed by 7.30pm. While I was at work, I felt fine - I think, like many people, I am capable of having two separate lives. But in the long term, I was acutely aware I was spending too much time at work. 'It's important to work out how much you mind not being the primary carer - my children had consistent childcare, and their father was around a lot. I was third in line. I was the husband, if you like, and the father was the mother. The eldest became quite hostile to me. He wouldn't let me do things for him. It wasn't me he called out for in the night. 'It's complicated, motherhood, and my feelings about it. I was at boarding school from the age of seven - until then, my mother was the primary carer. Maybe being sent away made it easier for me to break the mould. Yet when my eldest child was seven, I had the strongest sense of a generation coming full circle, and I couldn't understand what it would mean to send your child away. 'Now, I do much more parenting; I always knew I could only do a pressured job for a short time. I always had a sense that to keep going like that would be at the cost of my children. It's partly selfish: they were fine, but I wanted to be the person who was there for them. I wanted to be able to have my say in their lives, meet their friends, know about their days, be nurturing. And pass things on - mothering wisdom, the things my mother taught me, and her mother taught her. Like a baton, I want to hand them down. But you have to ask yourself: who needs who?'",

Where a scheme is non-contributory or a 'balance of cost' scheme, the employer has to bear the entire cost of any shortfall in the scheme's assets, so these schemes face the choice of increasing employer contributions or reducing benefits.

However, if a scheme is a 'shared cost' scheme, both the employer and employees have to increase contributions, where there is a funding shortfall. </p> <p>The NAPF says an estimated 9 per cent of its occupational scheme members are shared cost schemes and these are the schemes where employees are most likely to face contribution hikes. </p> <p>Post Office pensions director Frank Calvert commented: 'The Post Office scheme has had to cut its contribution holiday from five years to two, as a result of a number of factors, one of which was the abolition of the tax credit.

      "body": "<p>Flexible mortgages are now plentiful and popular but until recently there have been few fixed-rate deals available. 'Flexible' has become a fairly ubiquitous term, describing everything from the ability to make occasional lump-sum repayments of your mortgage to a current account mortgage, where your home loan is, in effect, an overdraft secured on your property. </p> <p>Research carried out on behalf of lender First Active Financial shows that flexible loans account for 11 per cent of total gross mortgage lending - or 4 per cent of total loans in place. Such loans, unheard of a few years ago, are estimated to account for 50 per cent of gross lending by the end of 2004. Until recently they have been offered mainly with variable rates of interest. </p> <p>Around a dozen lenders now offer such loans with fixed rates. There are risks with flexible loans of course: borrowers need to ensure that they do not over-borrow against the value of their homes, a temptation that may grow with rising property values. </p> <p>As interest rates rise, flexi-loans with fixed rates may appeal to some borrowers, especially those who feel they are likely to increase their borrowing over the short term rather than to pay off lump sums. </p> <p>Once you have taken everything into account, including various perks such as no Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee (MIG) charges and free legal fees, there is not a great deal to choose between the various options. </p> <p>The Skipton Building Society offers four options, all with fixed rates for two years until 30 April 2002 - the exact rate depends on the ratio of loan to property value and whether insurance is taken up, but the rates range from 6.15 per cent to 6.65 per cent. After this period the rate will be 1.35 per cent above the Bank of England base rate for three years. This compares with Skipton's standard variable rate of 7.49 per cent. </p> <p>Skipton's fixed rates for flexi loans are among the cheapest in this market but there are overhanging redemption periods with penalties.

      "bodyText": "Flexible mortgages are now plentiful and popular but until recently there have been few fixed-rate deals available. 'Flexible' has become a fairly ubiquitous term, describing everything from the ability to make occasional lump-sum repayments of your mortgage to a current account mortgage, where your home loan is, in effect, an overdraft secured on your property. Research carried out on behalf of lender First Active Financial shows that flexible loans account for 11 per cent of total gross mortgage lending - or 4 per cent of total loans in place. Such loans, unheard of a few years ago, are estimated to account for 50 per cent of gross lending by the end of 2004. Until recently they have been offered mainly with variable rates of interest. Around a dozen lenders now offer such loans with fixed rates. There are risks with flexible loans of course: borrowers need to ensure that they do not over-borrow against the value of their homes, a temptation that may grow with rising property values. As interest rates rise, flexi-loans with fixed rates may appeal to some borrowers, especially those who feel they are likely to increase their borrowing over the short term rather than to pay off lump sums. Once you have taken everything into account, including various perks such as no Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee (MIG) charges and free legal fees, there is not a great deal to choose between the various options. The Skipton Building Society offers four options, all with fixed rates for two years until 30 April 2002 - the exact rate depends on the ratio of loan to property value and whether insurance is taken up, but the rates range from 6.15 per cent to 6.65 per cent. After this period the rate will be 1.35 per cent above the Bank of England base rate for three years. This compares with Skipton's standard variable rate of 7.49 per cent. Skipton's fixed rates for flexi loans are among the cheapest in this market but there are overhanging redemption periods with penalties. If the mortgage is repaid in full, on or before 30 April 2002, there is a redemption charge of 3 per cent of the balance of the mortgage account, then 2 per cent until 30 April 2004 and then 1 per cent until 30 April 2005. That said, it is possible to make capital repayments of up to 10 per cent of the original balance of the mortgage each year without charge. It also has other flexible benefits, such as payment holidays and interest calculated on a daily basis. Mark Smitheringdale, head of corporate communications at the Skipton Building Society, says: 'Borrowers are now demanding both a competitive deal and flexibility from their lender. 'The society's view of interest rates is that they will continue to increase over the next 12-18 months or so and then steadily decline. Therefore, it is sensible planning to fix your mortgage at a competitive rate and then enjoy the additional benefit of falling rates.' The latest lender to offer a fixed-rate flexible mortgage is Standard Life - pioneer of the variable-rate flexi loan - with what it calls its 'Freestyle Fixed' mortgage.

Such a deal could have prevented the break-up of Rover. With the future of 50,000 jobs at stake in the West Midlands similar desolation now hangs over motor industry jobs in east London. At last week's private talks, Ford European president David Thursfield told union officials that no final decision had been taken, but the future looked bleak. A union source said: 'He painted a grim scenario. Keeping Dagenham was not likely because of the failures to change industrial practicces at the plant and recent stoppages.' He added that Ford criticised the workforce for producing cars too slowly. Ford is responding to massive overcapacity in European plants and financial losses with a radical review of its operations. Dagenham is the most vulnerable plant because of its relatively poor productivity, the pound and, Ford chiefs admit, the fact that the current Fiesta made there should have been replaced years ago. Trade Secretary Stephen Byers is in continuing negotiations with Ford, and is thought to have drawn up a series of contingency plans to try to soften the blow to the local economy. Byers is set to be grilled by the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee on Tuesday about whether he should have picked up clear warnings from BMW that it was about to abandon Rover. Senior BMW directors told The Observer that the final decision to ditch Rover was made when they had to present the financial outlook for the group to the BMW supervisory board on 16 March. On top of 1999 losses of \u00a3800 million, they feared that Rover's losses this year could be up to \u00a31.6 billion. But UK observers believe BMW exaggerated Rover's plight to justify the break-up.",

      "body": "<p>In the average school, nearly one in six has been bullied in the past six months. No surprise there, perhaps - kids have been bullying each other since Cain and Abel - except this figure is not for pupils, it is for teachers. </p> <p>Bullying is a growing problem in the workplace, particularly among professionals who are supposed to be caring for others such as teachers, prison officers, doctors and nurses. A recent survey at the Manchester School of Management (Umist) found that one in four of us had been bullied at work in the past five years. In teaching it is one in three. </p> <p>The scale of the problem is often underestimated because, understandably, victims are reluctant to talk about bullying. Cary Cooper, the professor of organisational psychology who carried out the research, calculates that it is responsible for 18 million lost working days every year and causes 30-50 per cent of work-related stress illness. Ultimately, employers pay as well as employees. In a landmark High Court ruling in 1994 a social worker was awarded \u00a3175,000 following a stress-related breakdown and now an informal survey of personal injury and employment lawyers suggests more than a third of all work-related stress cases are about bullying. </p> <p>'In my view there are two types of bully,' says Cooper. 'The psychopathic bully has low self-esteem and may not be particularly good at their job. He or she bullies to enhance their status. It's a personality dysfunction and the numbers are relatively small and stable. The other type is the overloaded bully who has too much to do themselves and dumps on others. This sort of bullying is increasing.' </p> <p>He draws a distinction between European and Anglo-American corporate cultures. 'Downsizing, short-term contracts and long working hours all help short-term global competitiveness, but coupled with increasing technology overload from e-mails, faxes and mobile phones, they create a climate in which employees are overloaded and bullying is inevitable,' he says. 'This is unhealthy for UK plc in the long term.'</p> <p>It has certainly been unhealthy for teachers. The profession offers a lesson in the long-term impact of bullying. As assistant secretary of the NAS/UWT teaching union, Les Roberts conducted a major survey of staffroom bullying in 1997. He believes the problem is getting worse and the figures bear him out. A recent Guardian /ICM poll found that more than half of teachers intend to leave the profession within the next 10 years including a third of those under 35. Cary Cooper is not surprised. 'In our survey, those who are bullied consistently report the poorest health, the lowest work motivation, satisfaction and productivity and the highest absenteeism and intentions to leave.' </p> <p>Better employers are recognising this. 'We've had a bullying policy since 1994,' says Barry Gibson, chief executive of the retailer Littlewoods. 'Only in a workplace free from bullying can our potential as individuals and as a company be fully realised. I believe it was reflected in our success at the 1999 Institute of Personnel and Development People Management Awards.' The company was overall winner.</p> <p>Cooper is particularly concerned about public-sector bullying. A survey by the union Unison found that two-thirds had experienced or witnessed bullying. 'Many people in the private sector may feel they're paid enough to be able to put up with some bullying,' says Cooper, 'but that's not the case in the public sector, where management training is also less good. I've never been trained for my higher education management responsibilities, and how many school headteachers have? The odd day isn't enough.' He calls for better management training, stress audits, a safe whistle-blowing mechanism and an effective complaints procedure. </p> <p>So where does the bullying buck stop? 'The more hierarchical a profession, the easier it is for bullying to cascade down,' says Cooper. The NAS/UWT's Roberts agrees. 'There's increasing pressure on schools from outside,' he says, 'particularly on headteachers and they pass this pressure down the line.'</p> <p>Cooper identifies certain management styles as 'bullying'. These include naming and shaming, whereby poor performance is drawn to wider attention. 'Public ostracism creates a bad atmosphere among employees. Weaker ones become fearful and defensive, better ones leave,' he says.</p> <p>So how can you tell if your bullying boss is psychopathic or overloaded? Cooper believes it depends on whether they have always bullied. 'If your boss bullies regardless of circumstances, it may be psychopathic,' he says. 'If it varies with workload, he or she is probably overloaded.'

      "body": "<p>One result of the recent rises in interest rates has been a spate of launches of new limited-issue, fixed-rate bonds. Several banks and building societies now offer savers a tempting deal with some of these bonds paying 7 per cent or more a year before tax (worth 5.60 per cent after 20 per cent savings tax). The only catch is that savers must be willing to tie up their money for between one and three years. </p> <p>Until recently, for example, Northern Rock, which has earned a reputation for offering top-paying bonds of this type, was offering a mouth-watering 7.50 per cent a year (6 per cent) on a minimum investment of \u00a31,000. Savers can choose a fixed term of one, two or three years and opt for monthly income, though the rate payable fell to 7.25 per cent (5.80 per cent) if you took this option. </p> <p>Woolwich and Bristol &amp; West are also regularly among the leaders on these fixed-rate bonds, and building society members should also check what their society offers. Nationwide, Yorkshire and Britannia all run limited-issue bonds exclusively for their members, typically those of at least three years' standing. </p> <p>Woolwich's latest offerings include fixed-rate bonds paying 6.65 per cent (5.32 per cent) annually for two years or 7 per cent (5.60 per cent) a year for three years on a minimum deposit of \u00a3500. Savers who choose to take income monthly will get slightly lower annual rates but the two-year deal is better than anything available on longer-term bonds. The best five-year fixed-rate bond is from Norwich &amp; Peterborough, at 6.90 per cent a year (5.52 per cent). </p> <p>Nor is it necessarily worth waiting for improvements. Analysts expect Bank of England base rates to rise further this year, but increases are already priced into the rates available on one, two and three-year bonds. </p> <p>If you fix now, chances are you will be doing so at close to the top of the market. Dharshini David, UK economist at HSBC, says: 'We expect base rates to rise to 6.5 per cent by late spring but to fall to 6.25 per cent by the end of the year. Inflation is low so there is no need for aggressive rises in interest rates. These fixed-rate bonds from banks and building societies could be at or very near their peak.' </p> <p>At Merrill Lynch, UK economist Paul Turnbull agrees. 'Base rates are near their peak but might rise to 6.25 or even 6.5 per cent. </p> <p>'We are predicting base rates at 6.25 per cent at the end of this year and 5.75 per cent 12 months later,' he says. </p> <p>Higher-rate taxpayers will, howeve, do better still with National Savings Certificates. The two-year third issue fixed-rate certificates pay a tax-free 4.75 per cent a year. This is the equivalent of earning 7.92 per cent before tax for higher-rate taxpayers, which cannot be bettered in the private sector. You can invest up to \u00a310,000 in this latest issue, on top of any money you re-invest from any existing National Savings Certificates you have due to mature while this issue is on sale. </p> <p>But be careful with escalator bonds, launches of which are currently also popular with banks and building societies. These pay a fixed rate of interest each year for the term of the bond. Rates start at a lower level than on straight fixed-rate bonds but rise each year throughout the term. Escalator bonds are a good marketing ploy for providers as they can quote top rates of 7.5 or even 8 per cent before tax. But these rates are not payable until the final year of the bond. </p> <p>The two-year Leeds &amp; Holbeck escalator bond, for example, pays 6 per cent (4.80 per cent) in its first year and 8 per cent (6.40 per cent) in year two on a minimum deposit of \u00a3100 - an average of 7 per cent (5.60 per cent) a year. But you have to put up with less income in the first year to earn more in the second. </p> <p>On Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's three-year bond, the rates are 6.75 per cent, 7 per cent and 7.5 per cent before tax in years one, two and three respectively - an average of 7.08 per cent (5.65 per cent) a year on \u00a3500 or above. West Bromwich (minimum \u00a32,500) pays between 6.5 and 8 per cent before tax, an average annual rate of 7.25 per cent (5.8 per cent) over two years. </p> <p>A word of warning. Make sure you are happy to ride out the full term of a fixed-rate bond before your invest. Most bonds levy hefty interest penalties - 90 days' loss of interest is typical - on early withdrawals. </p> <p>\u0095 This is taken from the April issue of Money Observer, on sale at newsagents price \u00a33.50.

Savers can choose a fixed term of one, two or three years and opt for monthly income, though the rate payable fell to 7.25 per cent (5.80 per cent) if you took this option. Woolwich and Bristol &amp; West are also regularly among the leaders on these fixed-rate bonds, and building society members should also check what their society offers. Nationwide, Yorkshire and Britannia all run limited-issue bonds exclusively for their members, typically those of at least three years' standing. Woolwich's latest offerings include fixed-rate bonds paying 6.65 per cent (5.32 per cent) annually for two years or 7 per cent (5.60 per cent) a year for three years on a minimum deposit of \u00a3500. Savers who choose to take income monthly will get slightly lower annual rates but the two-year deal is better than anything available on longer-term bonds. The best five-year fixed-rate bond is from Norwich &amp; Peterborough, at 6.90 per cent a year (5.52 per cent). Nor is it necessarily worth waiting for improvements. Analysts expect Bank of England base rates to rise further this year, but increases are already priced into the rates available on one, two and three-year bonds. If you fix now, chances are you will be doing so at close to the top of the market. Dharshini David, UK economist at HSBC, says: 'We expect base rates to rise to 6.5 per cent by late spring but to fall to 6.25 per cent by the end of the year. Inflation is low so there is no need for aggressive rises in interest rates. These fixed-rate bonds from banks and building societies could be at or very near their peak.' At Merrill Lynch, UK economist Paul Turnbull agrees. 'Base rates are near their peak but might rise to 6.25 or even 6.5 per cent. 'We are predicting base rates at 6.25 per cent at the end of this year and 5.75 per cent 12 months later,' he says. Higher-rate taxpayers will, howeve, do better still with National Savings Certificates. The two-year third issue fixed-rate certificates pay a tax-free 4.75 per cent a year. This is the equivalent of earning 7.92 per cent before tax for higher-rate taxpayers, which cannot be bettered in the private sector. You can invest up to \u00a310,000 in this latest issue, on top of any money you re-invest from any existing National Savings Certificates you have due to mature while this issue is on sale. But be careful with escalator bonds, launches of which are currently also popular with banks and building societies. These pay a fixed rate of interest each year for the term of the bond. Rates start at a lower level than on straight fixed-rate bonds but rise each year throughout the term. Escalator bonds are a good marketing ploy for providers as they can quote top rates of 7.5 or even 8 per cent before tax. But these rates are not payable until the final year of the bond. The two-year Leeds &amp; Holbeck escalator bond, for example, pays 6 per cent (4.80 per cent) in its first year and 8 per cent (6.40 per cent) in year two on a minimum deposit of \u00a3100 - an average of 7 per cent (5.60 per cent) a year. But you have to put up with less income in the first year to earn more in the second. On Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's three-year bond, the rates are 6.75 per cent, 7 per cent and 7.5 per cent before tax in years one, two and three respectively - an average of 7.08 per cent (5.65 per cent) a year on \u00a3500 or above. West Bromwich (minimum \u00a32,500) pays between 6.5 and 8 per cent before tax, an average annual rate of 7.25 per cent (5.8 per cent) over two years. A word of warning. Make sure you are happy to ride out the full term of a fixed-rate bond before your invest. Most bonds levy hefty interest penalties - 90 days' loss of interest is typical - on early withdrawals. \u0095 This is taken from the April issue of Money Observer, on sale at newsagents price \u00a33.50.

Portman Building Society pays 6.25 per cent on amounts of \u00a350,000 or more.

But there are often strings attached - the Halifax's \u00a3100 overdraft depends on customers having a minimum monthly income of \u00a3500. For those prone to exceeding their overdraft, many current account providers also offer an overdraft buffer, which permits customers to exceed their overdraft without the heavy additional charges associated with an unauthorised overdraft. Smile provides a buffer of \u00a3500; on most accounts it will be between \u00a310 and \u00a3100. </p> <p>For those who prefer traditional over-the-counter banking, the news that NatWest and Lloyds intend to shut 600 branches is not reassuring. But even after these closures all the major banks will retain extensive branch networks. Building societies with strong links to their local communities are also less likely than most to simply close their branches and walk away. </p> <p>But when branches do close, customers become even more dependent on the 27,000 cash machines (ATMs) dispersed around the country. Many of these are no longer free, and although banks voted last week to outlaw double charging, they will be free to introduce charges at machines for non-customers from next year. </p> <p>Coverley says that most customers' experience of telephone banking has been positive. He said: 'Although engaged lines can cause problems, telephone banking seems satisfactory.' But not all services are fully staffed 24 hours a day. Barclays is limited to Monday to Friday 7am to 11pm, and Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays 9am to 5pm. At other times, transactions or inquiries must be made through the keypad of your telephone.

But those expecting a better deal on overdrafts may be disappointed - rates are often no better than those available at the branch, though Smile offers an attractive 9.9 per cent. Coverley says: 'I'm more concerned about those customers who don't have a way in to accessing the Internet.' And so far, he says, there have been few complaints.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If you are thinking of a financial clearout, why not start with the plastic loyalty cards in your wallet? There's a 75 per cent chance of you having at least one, but you may also be what is termed 'a promiscuous shopper' and have more than 20. </p> <p>Despite their proliferation, however, questions remain about whether loyalty schemes are of much benefit to customers. Allyson Stewart-Allen, a director of International Marketing Partners, says: 'A major problem with loyalty schemes is the very low level of customer redemption. This is because programmes aren't enticing enough.' </p> <p>She says the key to a successful scheme is the ease with which customers can cash in points. 'But with 0845 numbers, waiting on the line and paperwork, people can't be bothered.' </p> <p>She adds that car rental companies 'put customers through a few hoops' and suspects that customers realise that firms don't really want them to take up offers. And she recalls an Argos scheme that died because not every petrol station honoured it. </p> <p>In contrast, Stewart-Allen says, supermarket loyalty schemes are well run. 'The reason why they are successful is because redemption at supermarkets is easy.' </p> <p>But Hugh Phillips, senior lecturer in retail marketing at De Montfort University, disagrees: 'With a 1 per cent reduction in prices on average, and with the amount of spending required to earn a little very high, customers are asking is it worth it?' </p> <p>His view is given some credence by the 23 per cent of respondents in a 1999 Mintel survey who agreed that it took too long to earn anything worthwhile. </p> <p>But though customers may be questioning the generosity of the loyalty programmes, companies such as Tesco claim to have virtually eliminated the problem of non-redemption, with 93 per cent of their Clubcard vouchers being traded in. A spokesperson says: 'We have the highest redemption figure among anyone offering a reward scheme.' </p> <p>Professor Merlin Stone, senior manager with management consultant Mummert &amp; Partner, says: 'Simple cash redemption clearly works best, and of course it can be forced through reductions on subsequent purchases, or pushed at the point of sale [as in Sainsbury's].' </p> <p>He says that, compared to US schemes, those in the UK have a better financial basis, which encourages customers to redeem points. As a result, he says, 'Sainsbury's Reward scheme virtually guarantees close to 100 per cent take-up.' </p> <p>But the performance of loyalty programmes can be both patchy and complex.

      "bodyText": "If you are thinking of a financial clearout, why not start with the plastic loyalty cards in your wallet? There's a 75 per cent chance of you having at least one, but you may also be what is termed 'a promiscuous shopper' and have more than 20. Despite their proliferation, however, questions remain about whether loyalty schemes are of much benefit to customers. Allyson Stewart-Allen, a director of International Marketing Partners, says: 'A major problem with loyalty schemes is the very low level of customer redemption. This is because programmes aren't enticing enough.' She says the key to a successful scheme is the ease with which customers can cash in points. 'But with 0845 numbers, waiting on the line and paperwork, people can't be bothered.' She adds that car rental companies 'put customers through a few hoops' and suspects that customers realise that firms don't really want them to take up offers. And she recalls an Argos scheme that died because not every petrol station honoured it. In contrast, Stewart-Allen says, supermarket loyalty schemes are well run. 'The reason why they are successful is because redemption at supermarkets is easy.' But Hugh Phillips, senior lecturer in retail marketing at De Montfort University, disagrees: 'With a 1 per cent reduction in prices on average, and with the amount of spending required to earn a little very high, customers are asking is it worth it?' His view is given some credence by the 23 per cent of respondents in a 1999 Mintel survey who agreed that it took too long to earn anything worthwhile. But though customers may be questioning the generosity of the loyalty programmes, companies such as Tesco claim to have virtually eliminated the problem of non-redemption, with 93 per cent of their Clubcard vouchers being traded in. A spokesperson says: 'We have the highest redemption figure among anyone offering a reward scheme.' Professor Merlin Stone, senior manager with management consultant Mummert &amp; Partner, says: 'Simple cash redemption clearly works best, and of course it can be forced through reductions on subsequent purchases, or pushed at the point of sale [as in Sainsbury's].' He says that, compared to US schemes, those in the UK have a better financial basis, which encourages customers to redeem points. As a result, he says, 'Sainsbury's Reward scheme virtually guarantees close to 100 per cent take-up.' But the performance of loyalty programmes can be both patchy and complex. A spokesperson for Tesco says that only one in five Clubcard coupons, which have to be exchanged for specific types of goods within a certain time limit, are recouped. Stone says even the best-run schemes have difficulties getting customers to cash in points. 'Many customers seem not to wish to redeem but to collect for something in the future, and some become inactive with points balances.' He says that these factors, and the time lag between issuing and redeeming points, explain why the Boots Advantage scheme's 10.5 million members have redeemed only 52 per cent of points issued. But Stone argues that once the rate at which points are issued levels off, the redemption rate will be much higher. And furthermore, he says, it is in Boots's own interest to get its members to redeem, as they are 70 per cent more valuable to the company than other shoppers.

The second is \"East London woman\" with a projected shortfall of \u00a312,200 on a \u00a350,000 mortgage due to be paid off in 17 years.

They are just three of many readers who have sent us details of their failing endowments with almost every major life office. </p> <p>Insurers are no longer allowed to 'guide' shortfall customers towards taking out an endowment top-up - and many people will not want to throw good money after bad. What should you do? You have a wide range of options; use our guide to work out the best course forward. But whatever you do, don't surrender or sell your endowment without taking advice. You have had the commission and cost pain of the early years - there could still be a gain to come. </p> <p> <strong> Your options </strong></p> <p><strong>Top up the endowment</strong> </p> <p> This was the option insurers pushed shortfall customers towards until recent FSA rulings outlawed this practice. The advantage is simplicity - all the life company has to do is to amend the policy. There is no need to contact lenders or set up new plans. </p> <p>But it could be throwing good money after bad. There is no guarantee that the enhanced sum will be any more successful in paying off the loan in full if bonus rates continue to fall - any stock market shake out would also knock terminal bonuses. Some companies such as Allied Dunbar charge new upfront fees. </p> <p>Topping up the policy assuming a 6% return before charges would cost: </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Aberdeen man currently paying \u00a391 per month an extra \u00a388 a month to meet the \u00a318,200 shortfall on a \u00a360,000 target with 12 years to go </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> East London woman currently paying \u00a367 a month an extra \u00a335 a month to meet the estimated \u00a312,200 shortfall on a \u00a350,000 loan over 10 years. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Middlesex man currently paying \u00a351 a month an extra \u00a323 a month to meet a \u00a35,380 shortfall on a \u00a339,000 loan over 13 years. </p> <p> <strong> Do nothing</strong> </p> <p> This can be an attractive choice for those with policies which are on track to pay off the plan at 8% and only narrowly fail at 6% - especially if you have spare savings you could use if there is a real shortfall after 25 years. </p> <p>Bonus rates on endowments could change substantially over the next decade - up as well as down. If you are gambling on your endow ment performance improving, check what the company's past performance has looked like. Figures from Money Management magazine show Axa Sun Life (ex Equity &amp; Law), Clerical Medical, Friends Provident, Norwich Union, Scottish Widows and Standard life are the only with-profits offices to appear at least 20 times in the top 10 position for 25-year plans in any one of the past 30 years for with-profits plans. </p> <p>Life companies which have never hit the top 10 include: Britannia Life, Canada Life, Colonial, Co-operative, Crusader, London &amp; Manchester, MGM, NPI, NFU Mutual, National Mutual, Pearl, Prudential, Refuge, Reliance Mutual, Scottish Equitable, Sun Life, Swiss Life, Teachers Provident and United Friendly. </p> <p> <strong> Invest in an Isa</strong> </p> <p> You can start building a separate cash pot through regular monthly savings into an Individual Savings Account, and figures below suggest it's slightly cheaper than topping up an endowment. Isas are free of income and capital gains tax and tend to have lower charges than endowments. If the mortgage redemption date is more than five years away, it makes sense to buy a share-based rather than cash Isa. Go for a blue chip or tracker fund rather than a risky hi-tech trust. </p> <p>But remember that share Isas are not risk-free; like endowments, your payout depends on future investment conditions. What's more, for small shortfalls, the minimum monthly savings levels - usually \u00a350 - will probably be much more than you need. </p> <p>For our three case studies, Fidelity Investments calculated how much they would have to put into a fund to make up the shortfall, assuming an initial Isa charge of 3.25% and an annual charge of 1.5%. The projection is at 7%, to take into account the tax free benefits of an Isa over an endowment. Fidelity's minimum investment is \u00a350 per month. </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> To fund \u00a318,200 in 12 years' time, Aberdeen man will have to pay \u00a383 per month, or \u00a394 per month if investment growth is predicted to be 5% per annum. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> East London woman would have to pay \u00a333 per month to fund \u00a312,200 in 17 years' time, or \u00a339 if growth is 5%. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Middlesex man would have to pay \u00a322 per month over 13 years to hit \u00a35,380, or \u00a325 if growth is 5%. </p> <p> <strong> Change part of the mortgage into a repayment loan</strong> </p> <p> This is expected to be the most common action taken to avoid a shortfall. You carry on paying your endowment premium and increase payments against your mortgage. Halifax is waiving its standard \u00a350 conversion fee for all shortfall victims and C&amp;G is waiving its \u00a3100 fee. Abbey National charges \u00a375 and will only waive it if your shortfall is with an Abbey National Life endowment. The figures below assume a mortgage interest rate of 7.74% </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Aberdeen man's \u00a360,000 mortgage is \u00a318,200 off target, and converting that part to repayment will increase his monthly payment by \u00a380 from \u00a3387 to \u00a3467. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> East London woman will see her mortgage go up \u00a330 per month from \u00a3322 to \u00a3352 to ensure that \u00a312,200 is repaid, and the balance of her \u00a350,000 mortgage is paid off by the endowment. </p> <p><strong>3</strong> Middlesex man's mortgage goes up to \u00a3273 from \u00a3252, an increase of \u00a321, ensuring that \u00a35,380 of his \u00a339,000 mortgage is repaid when the endowment matures. </p> <p> <strong> Extend the plan's life</strong> </p> <p> This is very much the last resort because interest charges will continue to rack up on an interest-only mortgage. Insurers can offer two choices - extend the life of the policy so that you continue to pay the same premium or re-investing the proceeds on maturity, and leave it for a few more years to grow. The latter course could have life and critical illness cover implications - it would be longer so the interest bill would be greater. </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Aberdeen man must wait six years three months if he stopped altogether - additional interest at 7.75% would be \u00a329,062. Continuing present premiums would stretch the period by 4 years at a \u00a320,925 interest cost. </p> <p><strong>2</strong> East London woman would have to wait 4 years and 4 months if nothing extra was paid or 3 years carrying on with present premiums. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Middlesex man would have to wait 30 months if he stopped paying or 23 months if he carried on. </p> <p> <strong> Remortgage</strong> </p> <p> You could end up coming out of the endowment disaster quids in if you use it as an opportunity to switch to a cheaper lender. If you are on a standard variable rate (so long as you have no redemption penalties) it's almost certain a broker can find you a better deal. One lender, First Active, calculates that rather than topping up a endowment with \u00a320 per month, the same money paid into a First Active current account mortgage would save \u00a313,327 in interest and pay off the mortgage two years and eight months early.</p>",

Fidelity's minimum investment is \u00a350 per month. 1 To fund \u00a318,200 in 12 years' time, Aberdeen man will have to pay \u00a383 per month, or \u00a394 per month if investment growth is predicted to be 5% per annum. 2 East London woman would have to pay \u00a333 per month to fund \u00a312,200 in 17 years' time, or \u00a339 if growth is 5%. 3 Middlesex man would have to pay \u00a322 per month over 13 years to hit \u00a35,380, or \u00a325 if growth is 5%. Change part of the mortgage into a repayment loan This is expected to be the most common action taken to avoid a shortfall. You carry on paying your endowment premium and increase payments against your mortgage. Halifax is waiving its standard \u00a350 conversion fee for all shortfall victims and C&amp;G is waiving its \u00a3100 fee. Abbey National charges \u00a375 and will only waive it if your shortfall is with an Abbey National Life endowment. The figures below assume a mortgage interest rate of 7.74% 1 Aberdeen man's \u00a360,000 mortgage is \u00a318,200 off target, and converting that part to repayment will increase his monthly payment by \u00a380 from \u00a3387 to \u00a3467. 2 East London woman will see her mortgage go up \u00a330 per month from \u00a3322 to \u00a3352 to ensure that \u00a312,200 is repaid, and the balance of her \u00a350,000 mortgage is paid off by the endowment. 3 Middlesex man's mortgage goes up to \u00a3273 from \u00a3252, an increase of \u00a321, ensuring that \u00a35,380 of his \u00a339,000 mortgage is repaid when the endowment matures. Extend the plan's life This is very much the last resort because interest charges will continue to rack up on an interest-only mortgage. Insurers can offer two choices - extend the life of the policy so that you continue to pay the same premium or re-investing the proceeds on maturity, and leave it for a few more years to grow. The latter course could have life and critical illness cover implications - it would be longer so the interest bill would be greater. 1 Aberdeen man must wait six years three months if he stopped altogether - additional interest at 7.75% would be \u00a329,062. Continuing present premiums would stretch the period by 4 years at a \u00a320,925 interest cost. 2 East London woman would have to wait 4 years and 4 months if nothing extra was paid or 3 years carrying on with present premiums. 3 Middlesex man would have to wait 30 months if he stopped paying or 23 months if he carried on. Remortgage You could end up coming out of the endowment disaster quids in if you use it as an opportunity to switch to a cheaper lender. If you are on a standard variable rate (so long as you have no redemption penalties) it's almost certain a broker can find you a better deal. One lender, First Active, calculates that rather than topping up a endowment with \u00a320 per month, the same money paid into a First Active current account mortgage would save \u00a313,327 in interest and pay off the mortgage two years and eight months early.",

And then, like one of those bursts into the penalty box, he really finds his stride. </p> <p>\"People see all the positives of my past,\" he said after training yesterday afternoon. \"The England caps, the fact that I scored goals, winning the Double with Arsenal etc etc. </p> <p>\"What they don't see is that at Arsenal, when it came out in the newspapers that I was going to join Middlesbrough, the Highbury crowd booed me for a couple of games because they thought I was trying to get a move for myself. </p> <p>\"They don't see the fact that at Bari, when it came out in the newspapers that I'd signed for Juventus - which was total lies at that time - 60,000 people at Bari's stadium used to boo me at every home game.

Two points from the past 15 have left Forest in serious danger of a second successive relegation. They are level with Crewe, two points above the drop zone. </p> <p>Platt's bitten-down fingernails hint at nerves. But the 33-year-old sounded defiant as he contemplated what lay ahead. The bust of Brian Clough in reception must twitch at the very thought of going down again. </p> <p>\"I don't want to sound blase,\" Platt said, \"but I'm very, very optimistic because every time this club has been faced with a watershed we have won. We lost four on the bounce and beat Portsmouth, beat Walsall in a similar situation. But I never expected to be in this position at all.\" He reckons 47 or 48 points should suffice. Not surprisingly he would not feel guilty about taking three of them off the club who launched his career. </p> <p>It is hard to imagine, though, that he expected to cross swords with Crewe and Dario Gradi as a manager. During his time there the club never finished higher than 10th in the Fourth Division. The memory of his freezing flat, where he wore training gear in bed to keep warm, might explain an apparent lack of emotion about going back. </p> <p>\"I was there 12 years ago and I had a lot of clubs so I will come up against them,\" he said. \"I have great respect for Dario, but there will be no sentimentality. I don't feel sorry for him and he doesn't feel sorry for me.\" </p> <p>Platt might feel sorry for himself as the abuse mounts. But he says he was prepared for it and that being the target creates a more pressure-free environment for his players. He uses golf, tennis and his horses to \"release\" his mind from the intensity, together with visits to a psychologist. </p> <p>\"It's not to pour out problems,\" he said. \"It's to talk to people about the things that are in you. For the last 11 years I have frequently seen a psychologist. I won't stop, regardless of what I'm doing.\" </p> <p>Gradi believes Platt will have good times to come. \"He's intelligent and he has a great deal of experience,\" he said. \"When you go into management it's often a bit daunting and you need a bit of luck. Bobby Robson got the sack at Fulham in his first job; I bet they wish they'd kept him now. </p> <p>\"I think David will succeed if he wants to do it. He's had other [business] ventures that haven't succeeded but they have been sidelines. You can't be a manager and have other interests.\" For now Platt's only interest is avoiding the drop. </p>",

The memory of his freezing flat, where he wore training gear in bed to keep warm, might explain an apparent lack of emotion about going back. \"I was there 12 years ago and I had a lot of clubs so I will come up against them,\" he said. \"I have great respect for Dario, but there will be no sentimentality. I don't feel sorry for him and he doesn't feel sorry for me.\" Platt might feel sorry for himself as the abuse mounts. But he says he was prepared for it and that being the target creates a more pressure-free environment for his players. He uses golf, tennis and his horses to \"release\" his mind from the intensity, together with visits to a psychologist. \"It's not to pour out problems,\" he said. \"It's to talk to people about the things that are in you. For the last 11 years I have frequently seen a psychologist. I won't stop, regardless of what I'm doing.\" Gradi believes Platt will have good times to come. \"He's intelligent and he has a great deal of experience,\" he said. \"When you go into management it's often a bit daunting and you need a bit of luck. Bobby Robson got the sack at Fulham in his first job; I bet they wish they'd kept him now. \"I think David will succeed if he wants to do it. He's had other [business] ventures that haven't succeeded but they have been sidelines. You can't be a manager and have other interests.\" For now Platt's only interest is avoiding the drop.",

It had been even worse a few months earlier when United lost to Aston Villa in that other domestic cup competition, the one that no longer dares to speak its name at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Dublin kept the smile on during the dressing-room celebrations after the Chelsea win but admits: \"It is not the same as being on the pitch at the end with your sweaty kit on.\" That is why he is determined to be standing in the Wembley centre-circle saluting Villa fans after tomorrow's FA Cup semi-final against Bolton. </p> <p>The striker is not, though, degenerating into footballing cliche when he says he will be happy just to be a part of the occasion; he should be that at least since he is expected to start tomorrow. When he was carried off with a broken neck last December after a collision with Sheffield Wednesday's Gerald Sibon it was feared that the only place he would watch any future football, including cup finals, would be from the wheelchair enclosure. </p> <p>\"The surgeon told me I could easily have ended up in a wheelchair. When he said my neck had been broken my wife Louise and I burst into tears. I was saying, 'What about my football? I need to play football'.

And he can be thankful for the skills of his surgeon Andre Jackowski, who in a 2-hour operation replaced the crushed bones in his vertebrae with a graft from his hip, knitting it into place with a plate and four screws. </p> <p>It would now require an even lengthier operation to wipe the smile off Dublin's face, so delighted is he not only to have recovered fully but to have done so in a time that the surgeon had thought impossible. His x-rays revealed such improvement after six weeks that Jackowski swore that, had he not known the name of the patient, he would have assumed the vertebrae were three months old. </p> <p>To return to Premiership action, as Dublin did against Derby last weekend, after just over three months is little short of miraculous. That might explain not just the ever-present smile but the self-deprecatory humour which is a rare trait in a footballer. Pinpointing the recovery in Villa's fortunes as the moment he was wheeled out of the ground on December 18, he says: \"They won that game in the dying minutes and have now lost only once in 14 Premiership games.\" </p> <p>There was, though, an embarrassing defeat against Leicester in the second leg of the Worthington Cup semi-final, after a draw at Villa Park which even the home players admit was a bottle job. Dublin, who kept his distance from team-mates while recovering, said: \"We didn't play well and there was very little passing and movement. That's why I'm so pleased we have got a second chance and why it would be a crying shame if we let it go down the pan.\" </p> <p>Nothing short of a bolt in his neck could have prevented Dublin, 31 this month, making his cameo appearance against Derby last week and no, he says, he was not afraid of going up for high balls or making his usual aggressive challenges. In any case, he says, those delightful team-mates Ugo Ehiogu and the captain Gareth Southgate had made sure in training that he was up to the physical challenge. </p> <p>Dublin said: \"I only played the last 10 minutes but because of my expectations I felt worse than I usually do after playing 90. I was absolutely shattered afterwards, though it was great when I came off and heard even the Derby fans cheering me.\" </p> <p>His recuperation has been matched by that of Villa. So much so that Deadly Doug Ellis, normally quicker with the knife than MacHeath and who was being urged to sack John Gregory before Christmas, is now being praised for sticking by his manager. Dublin said: \"The great thing about the boss is that he is exactly the same, whether we're on a winning run or a losing one. He does like people to hear his voice, though, and now he has given up his touchline seat he is no doubt causing havoc in the stands.\" </p> <p>It will be hard for Gregory to resist a Wembley bench seat, if not tomorrow then certainly in May, should Villa finally reach the final. It is extraordinary that a club whose record of seven FA Cup wins is beaten by only two clubs have not even reached the final since 1957, despite four League Cup wins there in that time. </p> <p>They are confident of going back just before the bulldozers, though Dublin has his own reasons for wanting to recover his scoring form long before then. When you diplomatically suggest the injury must have been particularly disappointing after he started the season with dreams of playing in Euro 2000, he interrupts to say: \"I am still dreaming of that. If I earn my place in Villa's team and start scoring, I don't see why not. I haven't heard from Kevin Keegan.

Both clubs see stability and financial prudence as the way ahead. </p> <p>At Molineux the board appreciates Lee's first full season could be one of transition. \"This is potentially the best management team since I was playing here under Bill McGarry and Sammy Chung,\" says John Richards, the striker turned managing director. \"There's a good atmosphere, a good team spirit. That's why Martin O'Neill gets the success he does at Leicester, because he creates team spirit in the club.\" </p> <p>The absence of such a spirit, Richards claims, has been a key reason why Wolves have trodden water for so long. \"We've had players coming to make a quick buck,\" he says. \"Wolves are good payers outside the Premier League. We were attracting players coming to finish their careers with a good pay-out, and that causes unrest in the dressing-room and in the ground because supporters don't like that mercenary attitude. </p> <p>\"Also we haven't had players living in Wolverhampton or around. We've been allowing players on one- or two-year contracts to live further afield, which is not good. Now new players have to relocate to within, I think, 20 miles.\" </p> <p>Richards says many fans consider this Wolves' most promising position for 15 years, but Birmingham are a couple of seasons ahead in terms of squad depth and their top-two form either side of an injury crisis shows what might have been. \"If we had gone through those injuries,\" Lee admits, \"we would have been bottom.\" </p> <p>Francis has rebuilt gradually over four years, reaching the play-offs last season, and will expect at least the same again. If Molineux is awash with spirit, the air at Birmingham seems full of enthusiasm. </p> <p>\"The club was on its knees,\" says Gold of his arrival in 1993. \"I looked into the eyes of Terry Cooper [the manager] and I saw fear. He was a genuine man but he was dealing with a corpse. We put money in but money alone doesn't do it. </p> <p>\"A club has a heart - an identity - and, if you whack it into the ground, you can't simply come along, paint it and put some players on the pitch. The very heart and soul needs to be in place. You need enthusiasm and experience. Now people come up to me and say, 'We're going to do it this year, aren't we?' You can feel the buzz, the determination. It's infectious.\" </p> <p>There is a bond between Francis and the fans. Some are more wary of the multi-millionaire board, accusing them of underfunding Francis. The manager's transfer surplus is around \u00a310m and Gold says: \"If Jack Walker walked away from Blackburn, what would they do? Unless he left a legacy they would be in big trouble. Our desire to make the Premiership is all-consuming but huge spending is not sustainable.\" </p> <p>Even Sir Jack Hayward's chequebook is shut at Wolves after an outlay of around \u00a340m. Molineux reeks of style and wealth, including a flat for Hayward during his visits from the Bahamas. But \u00a324m losses from 1993 to 1998 meant Lee had to sell Robbie Keane to Coventry to rebuild his squad. </p> <p>He believes the new policy and acquisition of Ade Akinbiyi and Michael Branch have given him a faster, younger, more determined team. From 22nd in late September the climb has been impressive. Lee believes he is still six men short but the lack of finance hardly seems to bother him. </p> <p>\"Sometimes money can breed laziness,\" he says. \"I think if you're given \u00a310m or \u00a320m sometimes you don't do your homework as well as if you've got \u00a36m to build a team with. You need to analyse every penny. And the more money, the higher the expectation and the bigger the pressure.\" </p> <p>The pressure is high enough as it is. \"Sir Jack will definitely be disappointed if we are not in the Premiership or looking to get in the Premiership this time next year,\" Richards says. </p> <p>At Birmingham Gold would doubtless be tearing his hair out as well. But then it was ever thus. No wonder Newton never suggested what goes down must come up. </p> <p>\u0095 Birmingham have signed the Everton goalkeeper Thomas Myhre on loan. The Norwegian international will make his debut this afternoon. </p>",

The manager's transfer surplus is around \u00a310m and Gold says: \"If Jack Walker walked away from Blackburn, what would they do? Unless he left a legacy they would be in big trouble. Our desire to make the Premiership is all-consuming but huge spending is not sustainable.\" Even Sir Jack Hayward's chequebook is shut at Wolves after an outlay of around \u00a340m. Molineux reeks of style and wealth, including a flat for Hayward during his visits from the Bahamas. But \u00a324m losses from 1993 to 1998 meant Lee had to sell Robbie Keane to Coventry to rebuild his squad. He believes the new policy and acquisition of Ade Akinbiyi and Michael Branch have given him a faster, younger, more determined team. From 22nd in late September the climb has been impressive. Lee believes he is still six men short but the lack of finance hardly seems to bother him. \"Sometimes money can breed laziness,\" he says. \"I think if you're given \u00a310m or \u00a320m sometimes you don't do your homework as well as if you've got \u00a36m to build a team with. You need to analyse every penny. And the more money, the higher the expectation and the bigger the pressure.\" The pressure is high enough as it is. \"Sir Jack will definitely be disappointed if we are not in the Premiership or looking to get in the Premiership this time next year,\" Richards says. At Birmingham Gold would doubtless be tearing his hair out as well. But then it was ever thus. No wonder Newton never suggested what goes down must come up. \u0095 Birmingham have signed the Everton goalkeeper Thomas Myhre on loan. The Norwegian international will make his debut this afternoon.",

This week alone, you can choose from Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts as a feisty single mom battling corrupt corporations) and the much-acclaimed Boys Don't Cry (Hilary Swank as unfortunate transsexual Brandon Teena).</p> <p>But, while the real Erin Brockovich was so pleased with her transformation into a movie character she took a cameo in the film, other recipients of the same honour haven't been quite so enamoured of the results. In fact, some of the actual people depicted in Boys Don't Cry - not to mention other recent efforts The Insider and The Hurricane - are very, very unhappy indeed. So, since when is Hollywood so interested in making movies about nobodies and (while we're at it) why are these upstarts getting vexed about the way they've been portrayed? </p> <p>Well, the problem with nobodies is there is usually good reason why they're exactly that. After all, most people's daily routines would make an excruciatingly tedious film: get up, go to work, come home, go to bed is hardly the stuff silver-screen dreams are made of. We're not talking biopics of the great and the good here, but normal people with one significant event in their lives (the infamous \"arc\" so beloved of Hollywood scriptwriters). The facts of the matter, while interesting enough to warrant the movie treatment, might not have quite enough dramatic edge to sustain audience interest - so characters are amalgamated or omitted, events are reordered, and certain things are simply invented for artistic purposes. And this really pisses people off. </p> <p>Now you probably wouldn't be too concerned if you were played by Julia Roberts or, as in the case of Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman - the chief protagonists of The Insider - by Russell Crowe or Al Pacino. That goes double if you're not only made out to be good-looking, but brave and crusading as well. However, if, like 60 Minutes \u00d9ber-anchor Mike Wallace, you think you've been made to look, well, a bit sneaky, you might well ask (as he did) \"Where does the truth leave off and docudrama begin?\" </p> <p>Or, if you are Wigand's ex-wife, you might just threaten to sue backers Disney, because you claim you didn't leave your husband as a result of the mysterious death-threats depicted in the movie, but because he abused you. A big difference to those involved, perhaps, but a trifle to the film-makers. </p> <p>And what if something about The Hurricane (with Denzel Washington as wrongfully convicted boxer Rubin Carter) got your goat? Well, if you are Selwyn Raab you write an article in the New York Times accusing the movie of being, \"history contorted for dramatic effect\" (and not just because you were annoyed that your involvement in the actual campaign to free Carter was ignored or anything). Or, like former middleweight champion Joey Giardello, you sue the producers for defamation, as you're terribly upset at the implication you only won a bout against Carter because of the racial prejudice of the judge (and also because it shows you getting a right royal ass-whupping). </p> <p>Meanwhile, the only reason Brandon Teena, the transgender hero of Boys Don't Cry, can't threaten to sue anyone is because he's dead. So it was left to ex-girlfriend Lana Tisdel to try to stop distribution of the film, claiming it misrepresented the facts of the matter, and unselfconsciously announcing that it destroyed, \"the spirit and the memory of Brandon as badly as the two killers destroyed his body\". But, of course, there have been far worse cases of art thieving wholesale from life. </p> <p>\"He stole my life - he took my life and put it on the Broadway stage.\" So wailed convicted conman David Hampton, whose real-life case inspired John Guare to write Six Degrees Of Separation, and who then tried to sue for a share of the profits from the play (later filmed with Will Smith in the lead role). Hampton, who passed himself off as the son of Sidney Poitier and conned his way into the lives of some of Manhattan's richest inhabitants, argued he was entitled to the money made from his story, because Guare couldn't have written it without him. Guess what? He lost. </p> <p>But we shouldn't find it too surprising that people don't necessarily own the rights to their own life stories. We live in a world where a modicum of media exposure can turn anyone into a pseudo-celebrity (even a two-bit cruise ship singer and a fat airline employee). Audiences have always had a problem separating fiction from reality, and the popularity of docusoaps and mockumentaries only serves to blur the boundaries even further. While some films acknowledge this - the oh-so postmodern The Blair Witch Project for one - we're all too willing to accept a fictionalisation of real events as the very last word on a subject. </p> <p>And now Hollywood, sick of rehashing the minutiae of its own sordid business for subject matter, is turning to the outside world for inspiration. Nothing gives actors more satisfaction than pretending to be \"real\" - it lets them kid themselves they're doing something worthwhile. Julia Roberts, last seen playing Julia Roberts (badly) in Notting Hill, gets her thespian props for playing a crusading law clerk, albeit one with a penchant for mini-skirts and abundant cleavage, and I'm sure Hilary Swank would much rather be remembered for her Oscar-winning turn in Boys Don't Cry than for The Next Karate Kid.</p> <p>It's OK for the actors: they get to stop playing at reality the moment the camera stops rolling, and go back to doing whatever it is actors do all day. The genuine articles are stuck living the same old life. When their story is appropriated, they become public property but, unlike the stars who play them (and get so much credit for it), there's no reward and no chance to set the record straight. So it's little wonder that people seek vindication and/or bucketloads of cash in court - and bear in mind that getting all worked up about your thinly veiled portrayal in a film is hardly a new development (press magnate William Randolph Hearst and muck-spreading columnist Walter Winchell, for example, were none too impressed with Citizen Kane and The Sweet Smell Of Success). </p> <p>But the ensuing litigation is becoming more frequent, one reason being that, in the past, Hollywood usually waited for all concerned to be cold in the ground before giving their lives a spit and polish.

Where most major studio films used to have original scripts, or were adapted from novels or plays, the bulk of the recent films \"Inspired By True Events\" are based on magazine articles or one-column newspaper stories.

Now they are in danger of sharing a reputation. \"We sometimes meet for dinner,\" says the West Ham striker. \"I go without my wife and he without his girlfriend. They are starting to think that we are having a gay relationship.\" \u0095 Following the racial abuse heaped on Emile Heskey in Barcelona comes this tale of colour blindness from the West Ham goalkeeper Shaka Hislop. He recounts how a group of children were once racially abusing him at a petrol station - until one kid recognised him. Then suddenly they all ran over asking for his autograph. \u0095 The Fulham fanzine TOOFIF has published a tribute-packed, fund-raising brochure for the testimonial year of the club's long-serving defender and former captain Simon Morgan. And, yes, the brochure is sponsored by Captain Morgan rum. \u0095 Trinidad and Tobago have still to decide whether to call up Dwight Yorke for next month's World Cup qualifier against the Dominican Republic. But, if they do, the striker will miss Manchester United's Premiership game at Sunderland, thus improving the Wearsiders' chances of getting a result. So step forward the Trinidad coach who has to make the decision: the former Sunderland hero Ian Porterfield. \u0095 Dr David Lowry, a reader from Surrey, is unimpressed by the quality of the Welsh League. He asks acidly: in what other league could a team have a goal difference of minus-123 having already conceded 144 goals, and yet not be bottom? Step forward second-bottom Abergavenny Thursdays. \u0095 Away from the greedy world of Premiership football comes this inspiring tale of generosity. On the conclusion of a recent Harrow Sunday League match between Manor House and Blackbird Merlin, the referee Aaron Solomon found that his wallet had gone missing. So after he left the ground the Manor House manager Bob Burton and his players had a whip-round, collected \u00a345 and posted it off to the short-changed ref. However, Solomon felt so guilty about accepting the gift that instead of pocketing the cash himself, he spent it on scratch cards in the hope of winning money to send to a children's home in Essex. And what do you know? The scratch cards produced \u00a32,000 in winnings, enabling the children's home to buy new televisions and videos.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In a town best remembered for the club owner who tried to burn down his team's stadium, women's football has grounds for optimism. After 31 years as tenants at various miners' welfare clubs, Doncaster may soon be the Belles of their own ball park. </p> <p>\"Doncaster Council have given us a lease on some land at Toll Bar,\" says John Gomersall, chairman of the club, who dominated women's football in the early 1990s. \"The first hurdle's been crossed. No other women's football club has its own stadium, so this could be a major coup.\" </p> <p>The proposed 1,500-capacity stadium will cost \u00a31m, much of which may be provided by a lottery grant through Sport England. \"Our vision is not just of a stadium in which to play football,\" adds Gomersall. \"There'll also be a centre of excellence to be used for the development of women's football, working in conjunction with local schools. </p> <p>\"The council's support for the new stadium will take us forward. We are leaders and we want to stay at the forefront of the women's game.\" </p> <p>The council also owns Belle Vue, home of Doncaster Rovers. In June 1995 Rovers' \"benefactor\" Ken Richardson hired a former SAS trooper to burn down the main stand; he might have got away with it had the man not dropped his mobile phone at the scene of the crime and then left a message on Richardson's answer machine saying: \"The job's been done.\" </p> <p>Richardson and his incompetent sidekick were jailed but Rovers' slide into the Conference has reinforced the feeling that the Belles are the town's sporting stars. \"We are the most successful team in Doncaster,\" says the club secretary Martin Sill. \"I was told this morning that we were the Manchester United of the women's game. The chairman's a Sheffield Wednesday fan so I'm not sure he'll be too pleased with that.\" </p> <p>Unlike Old Trafford's, Doncaster's trophy cabinet has been bare in recent seasons as Croydon and Arsenal monopolised the silverware. But they currently lead the Premier Division and beat the Gunners 3-2 in last weekend's FA Cup semi-final to see them to their first final since 1994. It will be against Croydon at Bramall Lane on May Day. </p> <p>\"The biggest breakthrough we've had is the establishment of a youth structure,\" says Gillian Coultard, the Belles' England captain. \"The interest has always been there but it's thriving in this area now.\" </p> <p>Such news will hearten the Football Association, which also has a dream: the foundation of a professional women's league within three years. A deal has been struck with Sky to broadcast live games once a week next season, and the FA has thrown its support behind Doncaster's stadium plans. </p> <p>\"Professionalism is not going to be easy,\" admits the Belles manager Julia Chipchase. \"Even with the FA's backing it's still going to take a lot of help from different organisations to make it a success. But if we want to stay ahead then that's the route we've got to take.\" </p> <p>A purpose-built stadium will help the Belles to ring loudest among the country's 4,500-plus women's teams. \"The prospects are exciting,\" adds Gomersall. \"The game needs to ride the crest of this wave and we're in a great position to do just that.\" </p> <p>Doncaster's closest rivals in the league, Croydon and Arsenal, meet this afternoon in the League Cup final at Underhill. The Gunners have achieved the FA and League Cup double for the past two years but will start as underdogs. </p> <p>\"It'll be tough,\" admits Vic Akers, who combines his role as Highbury kit man with that of manager of Arsenal Ladies. \"But the girls realise that, after this weekend, we'll have either won something or the season will be over.\" </p> <p>Croydon have not lost a league game since May 10 1998 and remain on course for the first treble in their history. Motivation should not be a problem, as two years ago Arsenal beat them on penalties in the League Cup final and scored in the last minute of extra-time to win the FA Cup. And today the Blues will field seven survivors of those twin traumas. </p>",

      "bodyText": "In a town best remembered for the club owner who tried to burn down his team's stadium, women's football has grounds for optimism. After 31 years as tenants at various miners' welfare clubs, Doncaster may soon be the Belles of their own ball park. \"Doncaster Council have given us a lease on some land at Toll Bar,\" says John Gomersall, chairman of the club, who dominated women's football in the early 1990s. \"The first hurdle's been crossed. No other women's football club has its own stadium, so this could be a major coup.\" The proposed 1,500-capacity stadium will cost \u00a31m, much of which may be provided by a lottery grant through Sport England. \"Our vision is not just of a stadium in which to play football,\" adds Gomersall. \"There'll also be a centre of excellence to be used for the development of women's football, working in conjunction with local schools. \"The council's support for the new stadium will take us forward. We are leaders and we want to stay at the forefront of the women's game.\" The council also owns Belle Vue, home of Doncaster Rovers. In June 1995 Rovers' \"benefactor\" Ken Richardson hired a former SAS trooper to burn down the main stand; he might have got away with it had the man not dropped his mobile phone at the scene of the crime and then left a message on Richardson's answer machine saying: \"The job's been done.\" Richardson and his incompetent sidekick were jailed but Rovers' slide into the Conference has reinforced the feeling that the Belles are the town's sporting stars. \"We are the most successful team in Doncaster,\" says the club secretary Martin Sill. \"I was told this morning that we were the Manchester United of the women's game. The chairman's a Sheffield Wednesday fan so I'm not sure he'll be too pleased with that.\" Unlike Old Trafford's, Doncaster's trophy cabinet has been bare in recent seasons as Croydon and Arsenal monopolised the silverware. But they currently lead the Premier Division and beat the Gunners 3-2 in last weekend's FA Cup semi-final to see them to their first final since 1994. It will be against Croydon at Bramall Lane on May Day. \"The biggest breakthrough we've had is the establishment of a youth structure,\" says Gillian Coultard, the Belles' England captain. \"The interest has always been there but it's thriving in this area now.\" Such news will hearten the Football Association, which also has a dream: the foundation of a professional women's league within three years. A deal has been struck with Sky to broadcast live games once a week next season, and the FA has thrown its support behind Doncaster's stadium plans. \"Professionalism is not going to be easy,\" admits the Belles manager Julia Chipchase. \"Even with the FA's backing it's still going to take a lot of help from different organisations to make it a success. But if we want to stay ahead then that's the route we've got to take.\" A purpose-built stadium will help the Belles to ring loudest among the country's 4,500-plus women's teams. \"The prospects are exciting,\" adds Gomersall. \"The game needs to ride the crest of this wave and we're in a great position to do just that.\" Doncaster's closest rivals in the league, Croydon and Arsenal, meet this afternoon in the League Cup final at Underhill. The Gunners have achieved the FA and League Cup double for the past two years but will start as underdogs. \"It'll be tough,\" admits Vic Akers, who combines his role as Highbury kit man with that of manager of Arsenal Ladies. \"But the girls realise that, after this weekend, we'll have either won something or the season will be over.\" Croydon have not lost a league game since May 10 1998 and remain on course for the first treble in their history. Motivation should not be a problem, as two years ago Arsenal beat them on penalties in the League Cup final and scored in the last minute of extra-time to win the FA Cup. And today the Blues will field seven survivors of those twin traumas.",

Follow the road as it winds its gentle way through Lake Leelanau County. When the 204 hits the 22, turn left. </p> <p>Drive for precisely four miles until you see a track on the right, which leads away into a dark forest. Drive down the track, through the woods. Notice how it gets sandier under the car wheels. Park in the small area at the end of the track, near the little wooden hut. Notice the sand dunes, huge and imposing. Walk through the dunes to the beach. Look in either direction, it goes on for miles, a gentle curve backed by grassy tussocks. Sit on the beach. Watch the sun set over Pyramid Point and South Manitou Island. Die. </p> <p>This is Great Lakes country, the area where the US bumps up against Canada. Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, Superior. Each one a different inland sea, hundreds of miles across. Michigan, deeper, large waves, sandy beaches. Huron, shallower, wider, never ending. From the boondocks of Wisconsin, through Chicago and the cutting architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright, around to the rust belt and the hell of Gary, Indiana, where children play among burnt-out cars. Up past Detroit, and into America's industrial heart, where men like Henry Ford and Dr John Harvey Kellogg had bright ideas and made history and a fortune. And north, along Michigan state's smart west coast, to a place called Suttons Bay. </p> <p>Suttons Bay is the type of town you bump into when you were thinking of going somewhere else. We were actually on our way to the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron meets Lake Michigan. It was across the Straits and into the Upper Peninsula where Ernest Hemingway found inspiration for Big Two-Hearted River in the 1920s. Locals still like to refer to it as the \"last frontier\", where the biggest town is smaller than Luton. </p> <p>We never got to the Straits. Instead we headed towards Traverse City and the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, just south of Suttons Bay. This is the Midwest's Cape Cod and the Hamptons rolled into one, a coastline dotted with the condominiums of the rich Chicagoans who drive the 300 or so miles around Lake Michigan to enjoy clean air and wide open spaces. </p> <p>Sleeping Bear Dunes is pile after pile of 11,000-year-old sand pushed and pulled hundreds of feet into the air by wind and sea. Glacial action had a hand in forming them and now all the hard work is aimed at stopping humans destroying them. But it's all you can do not to run across the gold-tinged acres, just putting your footprints in a ground constantly shifting and changing. </p> <p>We had decided to tour the Great Lakes, stopping off when and where the mood took us. It's a strange region that includes one of the biggest, hippest cities the country has to offer in Chicago, and tiny, lonesome hamlets where people keep rifles and 50 tins of baked beans in the cellar for when the federal government comes to get them. Michigan state was where Timothy McVeigh, the man who blew up a bit of Oklahoma because he hated Washington DC, hung out with his bomb-making friends. </p> <p>We flew to Chicago on the east coast of Lake Michigan. Be awake for the fly-in, one of the most spectacular anywhere in the world. Chicago rises like an urban fist from the flat plains of Illinois, a city, unlike New York, which is well aware it is surrounded by water and takes every advantage of it. </p> <p>Chicago, the home of the skyscraper with streets wide enough to let the sun hit the pavement, is a good place to start any Great Lakes tour. You can get your fill of city bars and restaurants and trips up skyscrapers (try cocktails at the top of the Hancock Centre at sunset) before you set off into a countryside that quickly leaves city mores behind. It should, of course, be illegal to miss the Art Institute of Chicago or to ignore the city's remarkable black history. </p> <p>We travelled north first, into Frank Lloyd Wright country. Wright is the man who launched the Prairie style, a way of building that was not based on pastiches of British Victorian architecture but actually went for struc tures that were wide, low and long, a reflection of the country he lived in. </p> <p>In Chicago, he built the Robie House, while on the city outskirts, at Oak Park, are his home and studio and the Unity Temple, all monuments to an American who built houses at the turn of the 20th century that still breath the word \"modern\" today. He used to design his wife's dresses as well, so that she fitted with his interiors. </p> <p>Heading north out of Illinois and over the state line into Wisconsin, you come to the small town of Racine, where Wright built a suitably stylish headquarters for SC Johnson and Son, the floor-polish moguls. </p> <p>From Racine, we continued north through Milwaukee, the home of the Miller Brewing Company, before cutting north-east and inland to take the shorter route to Lake Superior. Here the names begin to change; Berlin, Fond du Lac, Wausau, Lamartine, Germania. The northern Europeans settled long ago from the south after the French had come in longer ago from the north. </p> <p>Slowly, you begin to see other names, as well: Manawa, Shawano, Chequamegon. This was once home, even longer ago, to the Native Americans, a people pushed to the boundaries of a country that was once theirs. Now they live in miserable mobile homes on reservations and the local white population trundle by in their trucks and swear blind that the Indians are a dirty bunch who should sort themselves out and go and make some money. </p> <p>But on the outskirts is the way that Native Americans make money - casinos. The car parks are packed, a reflection of a clash of cultures that has seen one group - white - looking through a prism at the mess that is the other - Native American. </p> <p>This is the Northwoods, a huge expanse of land between lakes Michigan and Superior. You left the Middle of Nowhere miles behind and struck out for a place the residents of Nowhere believe pretty remote: woods, glass-calm lakes and no people. </p> <p>We stayed with Janet Bekkum and her husband, Kermit, a man who must regret like few others a clever idea Jim Henson once had for the name of a green frog puppet. The Bekkums own Ty-Bach, a bed and breakfast about five miles from Lac du Flambeau. The garden runs right down to the water's edge, where you can borrow their canoe and drift away from urban madness. </p> <p>To listen to the Bekkums is to hear a little bit of forgotten America. Washington DC is a thousand miles away - they worry about taxes and whether the hunting will be good, about President Clinton's fidelity and whether the lake will freeze over before Christmas this year so that everyone can go skating. Everyday before bacon and maple syrup, omelettes and poached apricots, they thank the Lord for all they have. </p> <p>This is peaceful. Shuffle through the Bekkum's chest of drawers and you can find dog-eared pamphlets on walking through the woods where you might see a woodpecker or a wolf. We saw both and were glad that, when clapping eyes on the latter, we were sitting in a car. </p> <p>The Bekkums invited us to a fish-fry. This is a traditional Northwoods pastime. You drive in your camper van for about half-an-hour to a bar that has a Miller beer sign in the window and a lot of large trucks outside. Inside is a fog of smoke. Fish-fry is fish and chips. Kermit, a slight man with a hearing aid and an odd line in Norwegian jokes (\"What do you call a Norwegian woman in a bra? A Swede\"), ate a plateful of fish and chips piled Desperate Dan high. He had a glass of milk with it. When the smile-laden waitress came to see if we wanted more, Kermit said \"Sure.\" I looked at him with a degree of incredulity. \"You have to get your money's worth,\" he said. Eat all you can for $6.99 (\u00a34.50). </p> <p>From here, you can head north, to Superior and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, more big skies and wider horizons. Or east and into the Upper Peninsula before cutting back to the Strait of Mackinac and south, past Suttons Bay and something you must really do before you die. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>A seven night fly-drive to Chicago costs from \u00a3339pp with BA Holidays (0870 2424243 or <a href=\"http://www.baholidays.co.uk\">www.baholidays.co.uk</a>).

The car parks are packed, a reflection of a clash of cultures that has seen one group - white - looking through a prism at the mess that is the other - Native American. This is the Northwoods, a huge expanse of land between lakes Michigan and Superior. You left the Middle of Nowhere miles behind and struck out for a place the residents of Nowhere believe pretty remote: woods, glass-calm lakes and no people. We stayed with Janet Bekkum and her husband, Kermit, a man who must regret like few others a clever idea Jim Henson once had for the name of a green frog puppet. The Bekkums own Ty-Bach, a bed and breakfast about five miles from Lac du Flambeau. The garden runs right down to the water's edge, where you can borrow their canoe and drift away from urban madness. To listen to the Bekkums is to hear a little bit of forgotten America. Washington DC is a thousand miles away - they worry about taxes and whether the hunting will be good, about President Clinton's fidelity and whether the lake will freeze over before Christmas this year so that everyone can go skating. Everyday before bacon and maple syrup, omelettes and poached apricots, they thank the Lord for all they have. This is peaceful. Shuffle through the Bekkum's chest of drawers and you can find dog-eared pamphlets on walking through the woods where you might see a woodpecker or a wolf. We saw both and were glad that, when clapping eyes on the latter, we were sitting in a car. The Bekkums invited us to a fish-fry. This is a traditional Northwoods pastime. You drive in your camper van for about half-an-hour to a bar that has a Miller beer sign in the window and a lot of large trucks outside. Inside is a fog of smoke. Fish-fry is fish and chips. Kermit, a slight man with a hearing aid and an odd line in Norwegian jokes (\"What do you call a Norwegian woman in a bra? A Swede\"), ate a plateful of fish and chips piled Desperate Dan high. He had a glass of milk with it. When the smile-laden waitress came to see if we wanted more, Kermit said \"Sure.\" I looked at him with a degree of incredulity. \"You have to get your money's worth,\" he said. Eat all you can for $6.99 (\u00a34.50). From here, you can head north, to Superior and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, more big skies and wider horizons. Or east and into the Upper Peninsula before cutting back to the Strait of Mackinac and south, past Suttons Bay and something you must really do before you die.

      "body": "<p>I'd always imagined this kind of multi-activity holiday as a superior Scout camp: good outdoor fun, based heavily on teamwork, like one of those corporate training weekends where people are encouraged to bond and develop group skills through various torturous \"games\" and brainstorming sessions. How wrong I was. </p> <p>It soon emerged that people were there to have fun, guests and group leaders alike, and my brown bread-eating preconceptions also faded as the unorganised, slightly amateur feeling began to grow, which made the whole introductory evening more relaxed and friendly. </p> <p>On arrival, we turned in through the gates, between two dinky walls, each with their own manicured little lawn and lamppost, plus gilded signs displaying the words Moreton Hall, in a \u00a316,000-a-year public-school-sort-of-way. </p> <p>The excitement grew as we drove down the smoothly-curving driveway, which revealed a nine-hole golf course. Health-club land, I thought, as the high-spec tennis courts came into view. </p> <p>But the red-bricked mansion pictured in the brochure was out of sight and \"out of bounds\". Even the potted-plant and carpetted foyer of the sports centre was not for us. We used the side entrance, through the locker room. </p> <p>But the outdoor swimming pool was heated, there were three tennis courts, bounteous playing fields and a conveniently-placed canal. Our 10-strong group with accents from Yorkshire, London, Middlesbrough, France and Spain toured all this with our team leader Rachel. </p> <p>Despite the initial lack of Scout-like chants, there were still the introductory bonding games including the Human Knot: stand in a circle, put your hands in the centre, grab a couple of hands each, unknot yourselves back into a circle - you can imagine the scene. Then came the introductory briefing by James, the site manager: \"You're here to enjoy yourselves and, as long as I never see you in my office, you will.\" How pleasant. </p> <p>Pizza and chips at 6pm were wolfed under a mural of English proverbs: men frantically throwing stones at birds; businessmen on hobbyhorses and people being pushed off bikes - perhaps all signs of the week ahead? It certainly chimed with \"Superchoice\": the evening's signing-up for the next day's activities. </p> <p>However, there was no monitoring of who did what, so that for the most popular/rare activities - tennis, kayaking, golf - some people could (and did) miss out, while others may have done the three-hour kayaking session several times. This rather reflected the whole setup of Moreton Hall. Run by a PGL team whose \"Grandad\" was 26, the organisation of everything was rather lacking. </p> <p>Most evenings, we were kept outside on the grass waiting for over an hour, while the tortuous process of choosing our next day's activities ground into action. The first evening was chaos as the staff were trying painfully hard to be \"zany\", while the poor 19-year-olds behind the desks, who were as bemused as their audience, were trying to explain the whole convoluted concept of Superchoice to bewildered guests. </p> <p>Somehow it worked, though, and, once you got to them, the activities were generally well organised. The specialist sports like tennis and kayaking had trained instructors, so you actually learned something by the end of the session. </p> <p>An element of fun was inevitably built in - archery managed to include running round a tree, \"imitating a farmyard animal of your choice\", going through the rest of your group's legs, and finally, of course, firing an arrow. In rifles, there was a slightly more severe element. You had to earn your cutlery for the next meal, by firing into (tiny) boxes labelled knife, fork and spoon. Our three-person group ended up eating with our hands. </p> <p>The quality of the activities varied depending on the instructor. My first ballsports session was: \"Here are the balls. There's the sports hall. Go and have fun!\" The second time, however, was a veritable feast of organised ball-related games - non-stop cricket, tagball, volleyball, badminton. So find out at your Superchoice meeting who will be taking the various activities, and judge for yourself their enthusiasm (or lack of it). </p> <p>Pizza and chips, meanwhile, had dramatically developed into a multi-cultural culinary bonanza. By the end of the week, the kitchen staff's repertoire included mild curry, lasagne delicatessen-style salad, and always an enviable vegetarian option. The much-publicised nightly entertainment also managed to delight the hordes, with a Blind Date, a talent contest, a play by the drama group and the inevitable disco with karaoke. </p> <p>Further afield, we took a skating/skiing trip - all morning skating, shopping in Telford (useful for buying all those forgotten toothpastes and shampoos), and the afternoon spent skiing on a nearby dry slope, where you can either free-ski, or have beginners' tuition for free. It's also a welcome change of scenery from Moreton Hall. </p> <p>On Thursday, there was a day trip to Alton Towers which I can't recommend, as I didn't go. But my friend thought it wasn't worth the extra \u00a317 for a two-hour journey there, the same back, and all for a go on two of the smaller rides. </p> <p>As for me, it was nice and quiet on campus, and a break from some of the loud Americans on the parallel PGL Drama Holiday while they were away learning how to raise curtains at a theatre in Shrewsbury.</p> <p><strong>The father's story</strong></p> <p>Halfway through Olly's adventure holiday, I flicked on the car radio and skipped a heartbeat, writes Martin Wainwright. Disaster had befallen a group of teenagers on a hike in the North Wales borders. Two were missing, and possibly badly hurt.</p> <p>The hours of anxiety turned out to be someone else's - and fortunately not as catastrophic as the bulletin had suggested - but the jolt underlined the natural fear of novice parents who give in to badgering about kayaking, archery, late nights and all the other joys of a holiday without mum and dad. Will you get them back in one piece? </p> <p>The answer to that bottom-line question with PGL - the \"Parents Get Lost\" pioneers of solo teenage breaks - is that you can set it aside. The brochure's advertised degrees of excitement give you an obvious risk-range anyway, from Shropshire farm visits to abseiling in a French canyon.

      "bodyText": "I'd always imagined this kind of multi-activity holiday as a superior Scout camp: good outdoor fun, based heavily on teamwork, like one of those corporate training weekends where people are encouraged to bond and develop group skills through various torturous \"games\" and brainstorming sessions. How wrong I was. It soon emerged that people were there to have fun, guests and group leaders alike, and my brown bread-eating preconceptions also faded as the unorganised, slightly amateur feeling began to grow, which made the whole introductory evening more relaxed and friendly. On arrival, we turned in through the gates, between two dinky walls, each with their own manicured little lawn and lamppost, plus gilded signs displaying the words Moreton Hall, in a \u00a316,000-a-year public-school-sort-of-way. The excitement grew as we drove down the smoothly-curving driveway, which revealed a nine-hole golf course. Health-club land, I thought, as the high-spec tennis courts came into view. But the red-bricked mansion pictured in the brochure was out of sight and \"out of bounds\". Even the potted-plant and carpetted foyer of the sports centre was not for us. We used the side entrance, through the locker room. But the outdoor swimming pool was heated, there were three tennis courts, bounteous playing fields and a conveniently-placed canal. Our 10-strong group with accents from Yorkshire, London, Middlesbrough, France and Spain toured all this with our team leader Rachel. Despite the initial lack of Scout-like chants, there were still the introductory bonding games including the Human Knot: stand in a circle, put your hands in the centre, grab a couple of hands each, unknot yourselves back into a circle - you can imagine the scene. Then came the introductory briefing by James, the site manager: \"You're here to enjoy yourselves and, as long as I never see you in my office, you will.\" How pleasant. Pizza and chips at 6pm were wolfed under a mural of English proverbs: men frantically throwing stones at birds; businessmen on hobbyhorses and people being pushed off bikes - perhaps all signs of the week ahead? It certainly chimed with \"Superchoice\": the evening's signing-up for the next day's activities. However, there was no monitoring of who did what, so that for the most popular/rare activities - tennis, kayaking, golf - some people could (and did) miss out, while others may have done the three-hour kayaking session several times. This rather reflected the whole setup of Moreton Hall. Run by a PGL team whose \"Grandad\" was 26, the organisation of everything was rather lacking. Most evenings, we were kept outside on the grass waiting for over an hour, while the tortuous process of choosing our next day's activities ground into action. The first evening was chaos as the staff were trying painfully hard to be \"zany\", while the poor 19-year-olds behind the desks, who were as bemused as their audience, were trying to explain the whole convoluted concept of Superchoice to bewildered guests. Somehow it worked, though, and, once you got to them, the activities were generally well organised. The specialist sports like tennis and kayaking had trained instructors, so you actually learned something by the end of the session. An element of fun was inevitably built in - archery managed to include running round a tree, \"imitating a farmyard animal of your choice\", going through the rest of your group's legs, and finally, of course, firing an arrow. In rifles, there was a slightly more severe element. You had to earn your cutlery for the next meal, by firing into (tiny) boxes labelled knife, fork and spoon. Our three-person group ended up eating with our hands. The quality of the activities varied depending on the instructor. My first ballsports session was: \"Here are the balls. There's the sports hall. Go and have fun!\" The second time, however, was a veritable feast of organised ball-related games - non-stop cricket, tagball, volleyball, badminton. So find out at your Superchoice meeting who will be taking the various activities, and judge for yourself their enthusiasm (or lack of it). Pizza and chips, meanwhile, had dramatically developed into a multi-cultural culinary bonanza. By the end of the week, the kitchen staff's repertoire included mild curry, lasagne delicatessen-style salad, and always an enviable vegetarian option. The much-publicised nightly entertainment also managed to delight the hordes, with a Blind Date, a talent contest, a play by the drama group and the inevitable disco with karaoke. Further afield, we took a skating/skiing trip - all morning skating, shopping in Telford (useful for buying all those forgotten toothpastes and shampoos), and the afternoon spent skiing on a nearby dry slope, where you can either free-ski, or have beginners' tuition for free. It's also a welcome change of scenery from Moreton Hall. On Thursday, there was a day trip to Alton Towers which I can't recommend, as I didn't go. But my friend thought it wasn't worth the extra \u00a317 for a two-hour journey there, the same back, and all for a go on two of the smaller rides. As for me, it was nice and quiet on campus, and a break from some of the loud Americans on the parallel PGL Drama Holiday while they were away learning how to raise curtains at a theatre in Shrewsbury. The father's story Halfway through Olly's adventure holiday, I flicked on the car radio and skipped a heartbeat, writes Martin Wainwright. Disaster had befallen a group of teenagers on a hike in the North Wales borders. Two were missing, and possibly badly hurt. The hours of anxiety turned out to be someone else's - and fortunately not as catastrophic as the bulletin had suggested - but the jolt underlined the natural fear of novice parents who give in to badgering about kayaking, archery, late nights and all the other joys of a holiday without mum and dad. Will you get them back in one piece? The answer to that bottom-line question with PGL - the \"Parents Get Lost\" pioneers of solo teenage breaks - is that you can set it aside. The brochure's advertised degrees of excitement give you an obvious risk-range anyway, from Shropshire farm visits to abseiling in a French canyon. But whatever the timetable, the fledglings have well-picked and watchful mother-birds. As it happened, mother-bird was a rather emphatic misnomer for Rachel, Olly's \"groupie\" or team leader, who looked only fractionally older than her 14-18-year-old charges.

      "body": "<p><strong> When We Were Orphans</strong><br>Kazuo Ishiguro <br>Faber, \u00a316.99, 313pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502387741,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p>After the exquisitely restrained and limpid prose of his first three novels, Kazuo Ishiguro made an impressive - though to some, baffling - leap from realism into a recondite, dreamlike world in The Unconsoled (1995). His fifth novel melds both these techniques in its rich exploration of the rupture of childhood and the baggage we carry from that \"foreign land\". Yet its surreal excursions benefit from clearer signposting, and the meandering longueurs of The Unconsoled have given way to suspense, intrigue and even a lightning-flash denouement. </p> <p> When We Were Orphans is narrated by Christopher Banks - by his own account, a great English detective of the 30s - who is obsessed with solving the ultimate mystery of his parents' disappearance in Old Shanghai 20 years before. Much of the novel unfolds through memory as, sifting through clues from his past, Christopher recalls his voyage to live for the latter part of his childhood with his aunt in England, his induction into London's high society as a gauche Cambridge graduate in the 20s and, most importantly, his expatriate boyhood under the nickname of \"Puffin\" in Shanghai. His father worked for a British company whose imports to China included opium, the source of a growing rift with his idealistic mother. </p> <p>In common with Ishiguro's earlier narrators - the Nagasaki widow Etsuko (A Pale View of Hills, 1982), Ono (An Artist of the Floating World, 1986), Stevens the butler (The Remains of the Day, 1989) - Christopher's memories are unreliable; he unwittingly reveals his self-delusion as he represses painful memories or lies to himself to make them more palatable. Adamant that his schooldays were happy, he meets schoolmates for whom he was \"an odd bird\", a \"miserable loner\", even a figure of ridicule. His memories are often triggered by encounters with Sarah Hemmings, a fellow \"orphan\" and at first sight a scheming \"snob of a new sort\", to whom Christopher is increasingly drawn but who marries the distinguished Sir Cecil. </p> <p>In his formal, understated speech, emotional repression and blindness to Sarah's siren call (she is often pictured looking out from balconies, desired but inaccessible), Christopher vividly recalls Stevens, the buttoned-up butler of The Remains of the Day, who aspires to being the servant of greatness but instead aids Nazi appeasement. Yet he also has much in common with Ryder, the concert pianist of The Unconsoled, whose personal traumas emerge as the primary source of his ambition and fame. </p> <p>In When We Were Orphans abandonment, displacement and betrayal by \"Uncle\" Philip - a mysterious substitute father who, with his mother, campaigns against the opium trade - fuel Christopher's ambitions. He longs to put right as an adult what he was powerless to change as a child, when he and his Japanese playmate Akira invented detective \"rescue games\" to save his father from imagined kidnappers.</p> <p>As Christopher's parents quarrel over his father's collusion with the \"sinful trade\", Puffin feels he has disappointed them by failing to be English enough - he is \"a bit of a mongrel\", as Uncle Philip puts it - in a world of competing and increasingly virulent nationalisms. As Akira, inhabitant of Shanghai, says (and it is tempting to read the two boys as a composite of the Japanese-born Ishiguro): \"You not enough Englishman... It same for me. I not enough Japanese.\" </p> <p>For Akira, children were \"like the twine that kept the slats [of a blind] held together... who bound not only a family, but the whole world together\". To such beliefs are traced Christopher's inflated sense of mission, his drive to earn love and approval through performance of his \"solemn duty\", and his paranoia about onerous expectations. </p> <p>With the detective peering through his metaphorical magnifying glass as the globe plunges towards conflagration, the novel probes, with growing absurdity, the wounds of childhood as they drive and distort adulthood - at the cost of intimacy, family and personal happiness. Christopher not only misses out on romantic love, but neglects his adopted daughter Jennifer - another of the book's orphans - through being \"too busy, trying to solve the world's problems\", and wanting to make her \"proud of him\". </p> <p>Like previous Ishiguro protagonists, Christopher uses other characters to understand or express aspects of himself. Sarah's crumbling relationship with the elderly Sir Cecil, whom she sought to goad to greater fame when \"what he wanted was a rest\", is a projection of his own parents' relationship; his mother's exacting standards may have \"broken\" his father. The novel redeploys the innovative technique of The Unconsoled - dubbed \"appropriation\" by the author - where, as in a dream, other characters feature as projections of the narrator's fears and desires, people from his past or himself at different stages of life.</p> <p>In this novel Christopher's obsessions direct the action. \"Our childhood becomes like a foreign land once we are grown,\" he is told; for him, childhood is literally a foreign country, but one where he felt more at home than in England. As his drive to \"solve\" an unresolved past and his unacknowledged pursuit of Sarah necessitate a return to Shanghai in 1937, the narrative veers towards a surreal climax. In the deluded belief that his parents remain captive in a house outside the international settlement, the detective wanders into the frontline of Japan's invading army, while Sarah waits to run away with him to Macao. </p> <p>This nightmare of suspense in an apocalyptic landscape consummately dramatises Christopher's inner battle between perceived duty and the love he has momentarily allowed to lift a \"massive weight\" from him. Torn, he moves through fantasies recognisable from his games with Akira - whom, years later, he imagines he has rediscovered in an unknown wounded Japanese soldier. </p> <p> Yet Ishiguro is at pains to anchor this surreal breakdown to a more realist conclusion. The detective ironically fails to solve his own case; disclosures about his parents' fate uncover not only a banal villainy and the perversion of political ideals, but a cause for guilt greater than Christopher had imagined behind the privilege and inheritance he took for granted. The cocoon of his boyhood beliefs is finally burst open as the dire cost is exposed of maintaining what, for all the terrors he carried into adulthood, was still an \"enchanted world\". </p> <p>Christopher's guilt reflects that of a whole nation - which fuelled opium addiction as a matter of policy and abandoned the Chinese to Japanese invasion in their abject \"warren\" dwellings. This becomes explicit through his revulsion at the decadence of Shanghai's international settlement, its European elite clutching cocktails during the Japanese bombardment of the Chinese quarter as though watching a cricket match. He is disgusted at their lack of \"honest shame\": \"At the heart of the maelstrom threatening to suck in the whole of the civilised world is a pathetic conspiracy of denial.\" </p> <p>So while the detective may have an absurd sense of mission (paralleled by the unknown Japanese soldier's insistence that he was building \"a good world\" for his children), his guilt at least signifies conscience, in contrast to the culpable denial of his compatriots: an exaggerated sense of responsibility is better than none at all. As the novel teasingly parodies golden-age detective fiction, it also weaves a deft parable of colonial immoral earnings, through a life built on tawdry spoils. \"You see how the world really is - what made possible your comfortable life in England?\" Christopher is asked. </p> <p>Ishiguro's view of character is not simply a psychological one. Christopher and Sarah are orphan outsiders striving to belong - the man through a brilliant career, the woman vicariously, through men - in a viciously exclusive society, where being well-connected bestows the crucial leg-up in life. Yet this novel, perhaps more than Ishiguro's previous fiction, signals growth in its characters. Sarah abandons her quest for a \"trophy\" husband to become a \"romantic\" in search of \"something warm and sheltering, something I can turn to, regardless of what I do, regardless of who I become\". </p> <p>In a quietly moving coda, Christopher, too, experiences a late epiphany of unconditional love that does not have to be earned by achievement or success. Although the awareness comes too late to free him from a lingering \"emptiness\", thinking of his mother, he realises: \"Her feelings for me, they were always just there, they didn't depend on anything.\" </p> <p>Ishiguro shows immense tenderness for his characters, however absurd or deluded they may be. If at times the signposting becomes almost too overt (\"Our fate is to face the world as orphans, chasing through the long years the shadows of vanished parents\"), this clarity is welcome in a richly layered novel that brings together themes from the author's past oeuvre. In its use of an array of techniques to illuminate psychological and political truths, When We Were Orphans confirms Ishiguro as one of Britain's most formally daring and challenging novelists.</p>",

As he shows me round the museum's collection of bricks, imprinted with the marks of the original 14th-century builders and passing medieval cats and dogs, he tells of the dreadful raid in 1944 when British bombs rained down on K\u00f6nigsberg and firestorms swept through the caf\u00e9s, the telegraph office and the shop where K\u00f6nigsberg's famous marzipan was sold. </p> <p>\"It was in revenge for Coventry and because of the Yalta conference,\" he explains. \"The Allies knew that K\u00f6nigsberg would be Stalin's after the war and they did not want to leave the Soviet Union such a good prize.\" </p> <p>The desire to blame someone for the destruction of K\u00f6nigsberg is easy to understand and a hard game not to play yourself as you wander from museum to war memorial in search of history. Who is responsible for the destruction of the streets down which Kant took his afternoon walk? What did the castle, symbol of the Teutonic knights' domination over the pagan peoples of Prus for eight centuries, look like? It is hard to imagine an ancient city once jostled up against the cathedral and castle walls. Still harder to think that this place, with its broken roads, treacherous potholes and muddy market place, ever had a past that was unconnected with shabby, shambolic Soviet Russia. </p> <p>It is true, that the RAF did sweep over the city, but they left plenty of it intact for Hitler and Stalin, the Wehrmacht and the Red Army to fight over. </p> <p>The story of K\u00f6nigsberg's capitulation is told several metres underground in General Otto von Lasch's bunker, hidden in a courtyard behind Lenin Prospect. Here a series of comically gory tableaux display the taking of K\u00f6nigsberg by the Red Army in April 1945. A plastic horse, its red-painted plastic guts spilled out, lies among dead model Germans and the occasional Red Army Action Man soldier. </p> <p>The signs beside the exhibits and maps still talk of \"fascists\" and total up the number of war dead - 42,000 German soldiers, 60,000 Soviets and an untold number of civilians perished as the three-day battle raged. Lasch, threatened with hanging by his F\u00fchrer if he surrendered and shooting by his enemy if he was captured, gave in after three days of heavy fighting. He survived both Hitler and Stalin, making it back to West Germany from Siberia to write his memoirs. </p> <p>Were Lasch and his troops to blame for the destruction by holding out against the artillery shells of communist Moscow? Or was it the Soviet planners with their ruthless, but ultimately unsuccessful, dreams of wiping any trace of Germany from their newly-gained territory? Here, history is too complicated to be reduced to a quick postcard home. </p> <p>At every turn, visitors are confronted by contradictions between the remains of K\u00f6nigsberg, the reality of Soviet Kaliningrad and the hopes for what this island \"exclave\", the western-most outcrop of Mother Russia, would like to be. </p> <p> F or almost half a century, the city's past was closed off and foreigners were forbidden to enter what was rumoured to be the most militarised area of the Soviet Union.

Only in the last decade has it resurfaced as a place visited by the intrepid, the curious and tourists wanting a distinctly different place to spend a holiday. </p> <p>It takes more than a day to get your bearings in this remodelled city and a dose of patience to get its measure. I learned to love Kaliningrad sitting on the No 4 tram with Marina, conductress and one-woman campaign to dispel the myth of the grumpy babushka. As she hands me a two-rouble ticket to the German suburbs, she smiles a gold-flecked grin welcoming me to her city. </p> <p>We rattle past the statue of Lenin on Victory Square and swing round - wheels screeching on iron rails - past the statue of Schiller, heading out to Peace Avenue, where flower-sellers old enough to be among Kaliningrad's first post-war Soviet settlers gather. </p> <p>Almost the moment Lenin disappears from view, we are in a place that, while not quite German, is not entirely Soviet either. The houses have green moss creeping up their walls but their roofs are red-tiled and outside the entrances stand metal foot-scrapers, leftovers from neat German households. </p> <p>Here and there, the clumsily-laid asphalt has broken up to reveal cobbles left over from before the war, and the streets are still lined with neat rows of lime trees planted by the ancestors of K\u00f6nigsbergers who now live in Bonn or Berlin. </p> <p>Kaliningraders are now proud of their city's past and speak of themselves as true Europeans unlike their relatives back east. They talk of houses built to last, spacious, high-ceilinged flats. Those old enough to remember talk of neatly-kept gardens sprouting fruit trees. Most will have a story to tell of meeting the children and sometimes original inhabitants of the homes they took over half a century ago. The idea of blaming these descendants of Red Army soldiers and orphaned girls for the destruction of K\u00f6nigsberg seemed as ridiculous as Nikolai's condemnation of RAF bombers. </p> <p>However, even a dozen trips on Marina's tramline, a day spent in the city's history museum or a conversation with a Kaliningrader about the past will not rid you of the nagging unease of never having found Kaliningrad centre proper or got to grips with its history.

The judges described Rafferty's article, \"Dance with a stranger\", published on September 11, 1999, as \"inspired\" and \"a nostalgic tango through the wild side of the city\". She received her award, an inscribed crystal trophy, and a cheque for \u00a3500, from broadcaster Mary Nightingale. </p> <p><strong> Teen spirit </strong><br> Making family holidays work can be tricky and, quite often, the older the children, the trickier the balance. In July, Cosmos (0161-480 5799) will take six teenagers and their families, selected from across the UK, to the Jupiter Saturno Hotel in Majorca. They will give their views on everything from food to accommodation, holiday reps and activities. There will also be an independent researcher on hand to discover how to prevent dream holidays turning into nightmares. You just have to wait for the results. </p> <p> <strong> Capital costs</strong><br> London is the most expensive city in the EU and one of the most expensive in the world to visit as a business traveller. The most expensive is Almaty in Kazakhstan, which costs \u00a3288.56 a day. London costs \u00a3245 a day. The research was carried out by human resources consultancy ECA International. </p> <p><strong> Excess-free cars </strong><br> Car-hire insurance excesses for all worldwide car rental bookings are being waived by <a href=\"http://www.holidayautos.com\">Holiday Autos</a>. Customers will no longer have to pay for the first part of any insurance claim if damage is caused to their hire vehicle. This coincides with the launch of the company's online booking site, which gives a \u00a35 discount to online bookers and access to late deals with discounts of up to 50% for departures within 14 days. </p> <p><strong> Call of nature</strong><br> Volunteers are needed to help with the long-term study and conservation of wolves, bears, pumas, monkeys, macaws, frogs and other species in South America and Poland. Anyone can join for two weeks or more, and expedition contributions are \u00a31,790 (Bolivia), \u00a31,680 (Peru), and \u00a31,490 (Poland). Details on 01502-583085 and <a href=\"http://www.biosphere-expeditions.com\">www.biosphere-expeditions.com</a>. </p> <p><strong> Garden party</strong><br> London's private garden squares will be open to the public on Sunday, June 4. Those unlocking their gates for the first time for this annual event include Westminster Abbey College Garden, Culverly Green in Lewisham and Warwick Square in Pimlico. Tickets, available on the day at the 60 gardens, cost \u00a35 for adults, while children under 12 go free. Details from the London Tourist Board on 09064 123410.</p>",

The judges described Rafferty's article, \"Dance with a stranger\", published on September 11, 1999, as \"inspired\" and \"a nostalgic tango through the wild side of the city\". She received her award, an inscribed crystal trophy, and a cheque for \u00a3500, from broadcaster Mary Nightingale. Teen spirit Making family holidays work can be tricky and, quite often, the older the children, the trickier the balance. In July, Cosmos (0161-480 5799) will take six teenagers and their families, selected from across the UK, to the Jupiter Saturno Hotel in Majorca. They will give their views on everything from food to accommodation, holiday reps and activities. There will also be an independent researcher on hand to discover how to prevent dream holidays turning into nightmares. You just have to wait for the results. Capital costs London is the most expensive city in the EU and one of the most expensive in the world to visit as a business traveller. The most expensive is Almaty in Kazakhstan, which costs \u00a3288.56 a day. London costs \u00a3245 a day. The research was carried out by human resources consultancy ECA International. Excess-free cars Car-hire insurance excesses for all worldwide car rental bookings are being waived by Holiday Autos. Customers will no longer have to pay for the first part of any insurance claim if damage is caused to their hire vehicle. This coincides with the launch of the company's online booking site, which gives a \u00a35 discount to online bookers and access to late deals with discounts of up to 50% for departures within 14 days. Call of nature Volunteers are needed to help with the long-term study and conservation of wolves, bears, pumas, monkeys, macaws, frogs and other species in South America and Poland. Anyone can join for two weeks or more, and expedition contributions are \u00a31,790 (Bolivia), \u00a31,680 (Peru), and \u00a31,490 (Poland). Details on 01502-583085 and www.biosphere-expeditions.com. Garden party London's private garden squares will be open to the public on Sunday, June 4. Those unlocking their gates for the first time for this annual event include Westminster Abbey College Garden, Culverly Green in Lewisham and Warwick Square in Pimlico. Tickets, available on the day at the 60 gardens, cost \u00a35 for adults, while children under 12 go free. Details from the London Tourist Board on 09064 123410.",

It was Sunday morning and the streets were deserted. </p> <p>The route took me through quiet little plazas, past the churches of Santa Marina and San Luis, San Marcos and Santa Isabel, to the convent of Santa Paula and a walled garden, the Jardines del Valle. Bandsmen were assembling in the plaza near the church of Santa Catalina. Seville grabs any excuse for a f te or festival, and nothing is more haunting than the music that accompanies the parading of icons through the streets during Holy Week. </p> <p>Neighbourhood bars were now busy dispensing coffee and pastries, and I circumnavigated the 17th-century convent of San Leandro, where the nuns are famous for their egg-yolk sweets, called yemas . </p> <p>On the far side, I came upon the Casa de Pilatus. Completed in 1540, the palace is a renaissance building in Moorish mud\u00e9jar style. Its ground floor is a stunning display of tiled courtyards and a garden, and its first floor a succession of cool, lofty rooms with wonderful beamed and panelled ceilings. This oasis is typical of the old city. Behind massive doors and grilled and shuttered windows in the maze of narrow streets lurk courtyards and patios, ferns and palms, marble anterooms and staircases. </p> <p>Refreshed, I continued through the maze and emerged rather suddenly at the cathedral. \"Let us build a cathedral so immense that every one on beholding it will take us for madmen,\" they said when they knocked down the mosque to make room for it in 1401. They succeeded madly. </p> <p>Massive though it is, the cathedral is well hidden until you get close. The former minaret is now the belltower, attached to a building of gargantuan proportions and diverse style, cavernous and all-pervading gloom inside, stuffed with paintings by masters including Murillo, Zurbaran and Goya, copious mud\u00e9jar craftsmanship, paid for with looted Latin American silver. There's even a hanging crocodile carcass. </p> <p>Round another corner is the Alcazar and its gardens. Mostly built in the 14th century by Peter the Cruel, very little of it dates from the pre-Christian period, but the decoration is based on the Alhambra in Granada. There was a long queue for entrance on my Sunday walk, so get there early or choose another time. The Alcazar's Court of the Maidens, royal and admiral's apartments and its exquisite gardens are worth the effort. </p> <p>I wandered on to the Alphonse XIII hotel, built in Andalucian-Moorish style for the Ibero-American Exhibition of 1929, formal and very grand, with accompanying prices. Behind the hotel is the old tobacco factory completed in 1757, a vast series of courtyards, now the main building of the university (closed on Sundays). Carmen rolled her own here. </p> <p>This was enough meandering before siesta, and I found a restaurant with a terrace overlooking the river for sherry, bread, beer, shrimps, omelette, beans and capers. </p> <p>The restaurant was on the edge of Triana, the old Gypsy quarter, quite different in character from the old town but appealing nevertheless. Beyond Triana is the 1992 Expo site, much of it forlorn but with a new Olympic stadium close by, and an Olympic rowing and canoeing centre on the river. </p> <p>Expo brought fast trains from Madrid - the best way to arrive in Seville, a grand journey through a haunting landscape - and transformed the river into a place of recreation and sport. Its old role as gateway to the New World had long since moved to Cadiz. </p> <p>My walk also missed out the old Jewish quarter of Santa Cruz, the bullring with its museum, the main shopping street and the Town Hall, besides countless churches, convents, nooks and plazas. I have spent two or three days in Seville several times, and have hardly scratched the surface of its Moorish and Christian culture, its obsession with fighting bulls, its haunting Semana Santa (Holy Week) parades which engulf the whole city, less in religious fervour than in all-day and all-night bar-crawling while following the endless parading of religious images. The culmination of Holy Week in Seville is the first bullfight of the season, so you can judge the attitude.

She uttered the phrase: \"That is so five minutes ago!\" in the original Buffy The Vampire Slayer movie, and kicked up attention in the box-office bust The Next Karate Kid. Then, after a stint on pretty people parade Beverly Hills 90210 as a single mom, Swank chopped off her lengthy locks for the indie hit Boys Don't Cry, which has earned her a seemingly infinite amount of praise and awards, culminating in this year's Best Actress Oscar. In Boys, Swank embodies the role of real-life character Brandon Teena \u0084 really a girl named Teena Brandon who realised early in life that she was born in the wrong body. So despite being a biological woman, Teena lived his life as a man. In her own life, Swank (who ironically was born in Teena's home town of Lincoln, Nebraska) is far less gendered-confused. She has been married to actor Chad Lowe for over two years, and the couple share their Los Angeles home with a menagerie that includes dogs, an African parrot and a rabbit. </p> <p><strong>Has all of this attention taken you by surprise?</strong> </p> <p>I wouldn't say by surprise, it's something that has been evolving. It's definitely very exciting, and it's really nice when people recognise your work, especially when it's for a movie that you're so proud of. </p> <p><strong>How has your life changed since the movie came out?</strong> </p> <p>People have been very respectful. I think most people feel like it's an important movie too. I have been sent a lot of scripts, and it's very humbling. Following this movie up is hard; finding something that I respond to and that can stretch me as an artist and as a human being is not easy. </p> <p><strong>How do you look back on shooting Boys Don't Cry? </strong></p> <p>It was very emotionally draining and physically exhausting. We worked very, very long hours: 18 hours a day, six days a week. I felt a huge obligation to tell the story honestly in a way that would make Brandon proud. </p> <p><strong>Did you do a lot of preparation?</strong> </p> <p>I knew if I couldn't pass myself off as a boy, that I would be doing the film a great injustice. So I lived my life for four weeks before filming as a boy, seeing when did I pass, when did I not pass. I read books on transgendered people \u0084 lots of literature which let me into the thinking and the emotions that they feel. Because I know that I can go back to being a girl that people can define, but not what it feels to live that, to know from the very beginning that you've been put in the wrong body. And there was the physical transformation \u0084 cutting my hair off, losing weight, not necessarily pounds but body fat so that what was masculine about me, like my jaw bones, would protrude. I trained for two hours a day lifting weights. </p> <p><strong>How does it feel becoming a lesbian icon? </strong></p> <p>I love it. I've had a lot of gays and lesbians come up to me and say, \"We're so glad that you're straight because if you weren't people would think that this was a gay movie, and it's not a gay movie.\" I found that very interesting. </p> <p><strong>Do you groan when people mention The Next Karate Kid? </strong></p> <p>I don't look back at anything that I did and think, \"Why did I do that?\" because it all made me who I am now. And without all of that, I couldn't have pulled off the performance that I did. Yes, I look at it and groan. I look at my work in it and go, \"Ohhhhh.\" But I learned a lot from that. </p> <p><strong>What do you do to kick back? </strong></p> <p>I love having friends over to play games. Scrabble and Celebrity. So much fun. I love to go to movies. They're my passion. </p>",

What kind of argument is this? <p>Surely the severity of the penalties society attaches to any given offence must be based on the relative dangers the activity creates? The English legal system is founded on respect for fairness and justice, at the heart of which is the principle of proportionality - that the punishment must fit the crime. Either these drugs deserve this level of sanction because of the dangers they cause, or they do not. The truth is they do not.</p> <p>We would welcome more research on mood-enhancing drugs, because there is still much to learn. But we are sure of some things: ecstasy and LSD are not in the same danger league as heroin and crack cocaine, and those who bracket them together are irresponsibly fostering public ignorance. The law on cannabis, never in more disrepute, is wrong in principle and unworkable in practice; because most people are well aware how safe cannabis is compared to the real killers, alcohol and tobacco. </p> <p>This week the government also refused to reduce the limit on drink-driving - which kills almost as many people as all illegal drugs put together. So how can you talk about \"sending messages\" to young people when you really mean criminalising them? We must raise the debate above this sloganising; the Police Foundation's proposals do this. We have a responsibility to respond in kind.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Mike Goodman, <br> Director, <br> Release</p> <p><b>Dear Mike,</b><br> The Police Foundation acknowledges that there is a paucity of research and information about drug use, yet recommends fundamental changes to the way we tackle the issue.

But I wouldn't like you to misrepresent my views, so I'd like to state them accurately.</p> <p>I said that the \"de-penalisation\" of cannabis misuse would serve to encourage young and impressionable people to partake of the drug. I think the classification of the drug is an irrelevance to the user or potential user, and I made no claim that changes in classification would have an impact on them. But I do believe the demoting of certain harmful drugs to a lower class does have an effect on those who supply and deal, because the penalties are less severe. The obvious outcome is that dealers see less risk and a growing market.</p> <p>Very few people are prosecuted or imprisoned simply for possession. The current drug strategy - law enforcement, education, treatment and rehabilitation - reflects that position. I support it, and I believe we are seeing it beginning to work. If we weaken one strand, we weaken the whole of it.</p> <p>I'm not at odds with you over the harm that alcohol does. You overlook, however, the growing evidence of how many road deaths are associated with drug use. It's unproductive to scream about the effects of alcohol and tobacco if we're not going to translate the lessons learned from those statistics into action with other drugs. Legalisation of alcohol and tobacco has not provided answers.

Drugs laws damage lives. In 1998, police and courts dealt with almost 128,000 people for drugs offences, 76% for cannabis. </p> <p>The vast majority were for possession of small amounts, often by otherwise law-abiding young people who would feel humiliated and intimidated by the process. Over half were cautioned rather than sent to court - but still tainted by a system that has proved ineffective in controlling the demand or supply of drugs.</p> <p>You misjudge my views on drugs and driving: those who drive under the influence of drugs must be prosecuted and accept the penalties. We are all waiting for a suitable test that proves impairment rather than previous drug use. A law doesn't have to be just, or even logical or rational. But it should meet these requirements to be worthy of a civilised society. </p> <p>If the classification of a drug is only maintained because the system would be weakened by attention to its most discredited parts, that reveals a need for sensible reform.</p> <p>Yours, <br> Mike</p> <p><b>Dear Mike,</b><br> Please don't try to put your own interpretation on what I say. I did not claim classification is irrelevant because few people are prosecuted or imprisoned for possession. </p> <p>If someone is considering using cannabis, or even heroin, it doesn't matter to that individual how the law classifies the drug. He or she does not say, \"this is a class A drug so I will not use it, but this is a class B drug so I will\". The principal factors influencing choice are availability, peer group behaviour and society's standards.</p> <p>You claim drugs laws are damaging lives. I wonder how you react to drug abuse damaging lives. I have (and I suspect you have) seen the devastating consequences of drugs misuse on the users, families and friends.

Relaxing the control of drugs would do nothing to change that. </p> <p>You say those with whom the police deal suffer from the ordeal. Let me remind you of the humiliation, intimidation and isolation felt by many drugs users. What you fail to point out is that law enforcement is often the gateway to programmes to help drugs users.

You say it does not matter to an individual considering using a drug how the law classifies it - but that this does deter suppliers and so the law must stay unchanged.</p> <p>But this is based on the curious principle of penalising the user for the crimes of the dealer. The idea that suppliers are deterred by the current classification is not supported by evidence: in the last 10 years, seizures of class A drugs have increased sevenfold - twice the class B rate.

President Jiang Zemin in Beijing has ordered an urgent investigation into the fire and the governor of Henan province quickly arrived on the scene. By a grim coincidence, another devastating fire at the other end of the country had also taken young lives a few hours before, prompting another demand from Beijing for a serious investigation. An explosion on Tuesday afternoon in a cigarette lighter factory in the southern province of Guangdong killed 17 young women workers and injured many more - the youngest victim was 14 years old. The fire swept through a long workshop with a door at one end and no fire escapes: those caught furthest from the door were asphyxiated by thick smoke.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The first-time film director Sam Mendes has struck an unprecedented deal with Steven Spielberg hot on the heels of his five-Oscar triumph with American Beauty. </p> <p>So keen are Spielberg's DreamWorks studio to secure his future services that they are pumping \u00a3100,000 a year into his theatre, the Donmar Warehouse in London, to keep him sweet. </p> <p>The unique arrangement also guarantees Mendes, 34, \u00a3250,000 a year to develop movies through his new company, Donmar Films. But if a brilliant script does comes along from another studio in the next two to three years, he is free to take it. </p> <p>There were lots of other big- money offers, Mendes admitted yesterday. But all would have meant foresaking the intimate Covent Garden venue that he has turned into a force in world theatre. </p> <p>His bottom line was always: \"I'll do this deal if you fund the theatre. If I had signed an exclusive deal with DreamWorks I would probably could have got millions. But I am very con scious of allowing myself freedom. Without that freedom I have here at the Donmar, I would not have been able to make American Beauty.\" </p> <p>Mendes gleefully confessed that he was now in a position to make \"pretty much anything I want I suppose. Now is the time to make my Crusades epic for $120m. It would be quite a dangerous situation to be in actually if I wasn't so clear about what I want to do.\" </p> <p>And after two years away from the rehearsal room, what he is \"desperate\" to do now is theatre. He will direct Twelfth Night at the Donmar in September, and although he has not yet cast it, he hinted that he would be going for a \"home team\" of English actors rather than importing big-name Americans. </p> <p>He said Hollywood stars were queuing up \"all the time\" to work at the Donmar. \"They see us as a way of increasingly their artistic validity, which is great. But that is not quite how we work. I'm nervous of star vehicles. As I think Philip Larkin said, the sun destroys the interest of what is going on in the shade. Often there is someone better for a role who is English or a theatre actor.\" </p> <p>Mendes denied rumours that he was close to persuading Tom Cruise to tread the London boards soon. \"I wish,\" he said. \"It's far more likely that I will be working again with Nicole [Kidman].\" </p> <p>He did, however, concede that he was yearning to tempt Annette Bening, the star of American Beauty, across the Atlantic after she has her baby. \"I don't know, it may take 10 years - she has four kids you know - but I would really love to bring her here.\" </p> <p>He said he \"hasn't a clue\" what his next film will be, although it was a \"safe bet\" it would be one developed by Donmar Films, which he said he wanted to keep \"small and light on its feet, a bit like this theatre\". </p> <p>He has has spent six months working on Lookout, written by Scott Frank, who adapted Elmore Leonard's Get Shorty and wrote the thriller Out of Sight, but he doubted that it would get off the ground for some time. </p> <p>The DreamWorks money would be added to the \u00a3350,000 a year that the New York producer Anita Waxman is pumping into the Donmar so that she can bring their new productions to Broadway. </p> <p>Mendes said it would allow them to be more adventurous and to get more people into the theatre with \"lower seat prices and pay-as-you-wish nights. We are doing one next month for the Passion Play. You pay whatever you can afford, be that 10p or whatever.\" </p> <p>He said he had enjoyed Los Angeles but wanted to work in England if possible. \"Hollywood gets a bad rap here, but I enjoyed very much working with the people I met there. </p> <p>\"Obviously the Oscars was an entirely different experience. You are on a train and it's travelling at 120mph and you can't get off. Like every director, I'm a control freak. But all you can do is just sit there and grit your teeth. Some of the time it's exhilarating, sometimes it's not. </p> <p>\"I was doing publicity for the film for what seemed like a decade. Did I enjoy the Oscars? Well, it's the single most nerve-wracking experience ever. </p> <p>\"It is away out there on its own.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first-time film director Sam Mendes has struck an unprecedented deal with Steven Spielberg hot on the heels of his five-Oscar triumph with American Beauty. So keen are Spielberg's DreamWorks studio to secure his future services that they are pumping \u00a3100,000 a year into his theatre, the Donmar Warehouse in London, to keep him sweet. The unique arrangement also guarantees Mendes, 34, \u00a3250,000 a year to develop movies through his new company, Donmar Films. But if a brilliant script does comes along from another studio in the next two to three years, he is free to take it. There were lots of other big- money offers, Mendes admitted yesterday. But all would have meant foresaking the intimate Covent Garden venue that he has turned into a force in world theatre. His bottom line was always: \"I'll do this deal if you fund the theatre. If I had signed an exclusive deal with DreamWorks I would probably could have got millions. But I am very con scious of allowing myself freedom. Without that freedom I have here at the Donmar, I would not have been able to make American Beauty.\" Mendes gleefully confessed that he was now in a position to make \"pretty much anything I want I suppose. Now is the time to make my Crusades epic for $120m. It would be quite a dangerous situation to be in actually if I wasn't so clear about what I want to do.\" And after two years away from the rehearsal room, what he is \"desperate\" to do now is theatre. He will direct Twelfth Night at the Donmar in September, and although he has not yet cast it, he hinted that he would be going for a \"home team\" of English actors rather than importing big-name Americans. He said Hollywood stars were queuing up \"all the time\" to work at the Donmar. \"They see us as a way of increasingly their artistic validity, which is great. But that is not quite how we work. I'm nervous of star vehicles. As I think Philip Larkin said, the sun destroys the interest of what is going on in the shade. Often there is someone better for a role who is English or a theatre actor.\" Mendes denied rumours that he was close to persuading Tom Cruise to tread the London boards soon. \"I wish,\" he said. \"It's far more likely that I will be working again with Nicole [Kidman].\" He did, however, concede that he was yearning to tempt Annette Bening, the star of American Beauty, across the Atlantic after she has her baby. \"I don't know, it may take 10 years - she has four kids you know - but I would really love to bring her here.\" He said he \"hasn't a clue\" what his next film will be, although it was a \"safe bet\" it would be one developed by Donmar Films, which he said he wanted to keep \"small and light on its feet, a bit like this theatre\". He has has spent six months working on Lookout, written by Scott Frank, who adapted Elmore Leonard's Get Shorty and wrote the thriller Out of Sight, but he doubted that it would get off the ground for some time. The DreamWorks money would be added to the \u00a3350,000 a year that the New York producer Anita Waxman is pumping into the Donmar so that she can bring their new productions to Broadway. Mendes said it would allow them to be more adventurous and to get more people into the theatre with \"lower seat prices and pay-as-you-wish nights. We are doing one next month for the Passion Play. You pay whatever you can afford, be that 10p or whatever.\" He said he had enjoyed Los Angeles but wanted to work in England if possible. \"Hollywood gets a bad rap here, but I enjoyed very much working with the people I met there. \"Obviously the Oscars was an entirely different experience. You are on a train and it's travelling at 120mph and you can't get off. Like every director, I'm a control freak. But all you can do is just sit there and grit your teeth. Some of the time it's exhilarating, sometimes it's not. \"I was doing publicity for the film for what seemed like a decade. Did I enjoy the Oscars? Well, it's the single most nerve-wracking experience ever. \"It is away out there on its own.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Vladimir Putin, the first Russian leader of the 21st century, combines the old and the modern in his political style. His presidential campaign was fought with western opinion polls and TV advertising, yet he also acted as both a tsar and a commissar - when Chechnya refused to come to heel, he sent in the army to raze Grozny. Like the communist leaders, he burnishes his image as a man of action without concern for democracy, telling regional politicians to produce a majority for him or face dire consequences, and surrounding himself with friends from his KGB days. And like Lenin in 1917, Putin achieved supremacy while just beginning to learn to make a public speech with confidence. </p> <p>So the Lenin question has not left the Russian political agenda. Among Putin's few statements in his campaign was the promise to remove Lenin's body from the mausoleum on Red Square and bury it properly. Nine years of de-communisation have lowered Lenin's prestige - he now comes only third, after Jesus Christ and Peter the Great, as the historical figure most admired by Russian people. Yet even many who dislike communism are still in his grasp. Charismatic Lenin founded the Communist party. He created the October Revolution and invented a new state - one party, one ideology - which became the model for states in eastern Europe, China and elsewhere. Lenin's works of Marxist theory were extremely influential. After his death, his ideas were codified as Marxism-Leninism, and his corpse was displayed in the mausoleum, where it is still given a monthly bath in formaldehyde. </p> <p>He has been a god to some, a devil to others. In the Soviet period, the Lenin papers were locked in an inaccessible vault constructed to withstand an American nuclear attack on Moscow. The nature of Lenin's personality remained a mystery. Only since 1991 has it been permitted to poke around in these papers, and the picture they disclose is remarkably different from his image both in the west and in Russia. He used to be portrayed as a political machine without a personality, supposedly so absorbed in the theory and politics of Marxism that nothing-family, intellectual diversion or even leisure - existed for him. </p> <p>The Lenin papers tell a more complicated story. Although he did suppress aspects of his personality, he never got rid of basic emotions, and these, compacted at the core of his personality, reinforced the extraordinary power of his outward behaviour. His passionate nature made him difficult to live with. His family had to make him promise not to talk about politics on holiday. In his years of power, he threatened to put colleagues \"on bread and water in prison\" for failing to implement the economic policy. He was probably being rhetorical, but nobody could be quite sure. </p> <p>Lenin was also a revolutionary romantic. He carried photographs of Karl Marx, and bought a postcard of Emile Zola when the French writer took up the cause of Alfred Dreyfus in 1898. He was desperate to conserve himself for the inevitable great dawn of revolution, and felt meant for a special destiny. His recurrent fear was that his health would not last long enough to do the job. He was always troubled by insomnia and ulcers and had heart attacks long before his final illness. His nerves played him up. Around 1900, a Swiss doctor gave him the terrible diagnosis: \"It's the brain.\" Already impatient, Lenin lived the rest of his life as if his personal clock were ticking quickly towards midnight. </p> <p>As his wife Nadya and his sisters, Anna and Maria, make clear in previously censored parts of their memoirs, he depended on their willingness to cosset him when he was depressed. He was cunning in playing them off against each other so that they would carry out his errands uncomplainingly. Nadya even put up with his dalliance with the Marxist activist and feminist Inessa Armand, who was captivated by him. When he broke with her before the first world war, she pleaded: \"At the moment I could manage without the kisses: just to see you and talk with you sometimes would be a pleasure - and this could do no one any harm.\" </p> <p>Lenin's family also explains much. His ancestry included Jewish, Swedish and German forebears. He may also have had a Kalmyk grandfather. This is a different descent from that claimed for him by Russian nationalists (who argue that his background explains why he was, allegedly, so anti-Russian). His family had come in from the social and ethnic margins of the Russian empire. His school-inspector father and his pianist mother wanted to integrate in the professional elite of the new Russia. As he grew up, Lenin had no time for the old Russia of villages and Christianity. In 1891, when famine and disease plagued his native Volga region, his sister Anna did relief work. Lenin shocked her by saying this was a waste of energy. The peasantry's plight resulted from capitalism and Anna's charitable work simply alleviated the symptoms without curing the disease. </p> <p>Lenin believed passionately in modernity: industry, urbanism, education and science. When his family was ostracised after his elder brother was executed in 1887 for trying to assassinate the tsar, Lenin concentrated the whole force of his being into the cause of revolution. </p> <p>Marxism was his preferred doctrine and he owned up to being \"in love\" with Karl Marx. Ideology meant more to him than women. But privately, he drew on other influences. Machiavelli and Darwin had hugely impressed him. So, too, had the ideas of the Orthodox Church priest Father Gapon, who led the procession to the Winter Palace on Bloody Sunday in January 1905. He closeted himself for days with Gapon, and from him developed the idea of expropriating the entire property of the landed gentry. Lenin sincerely believed in Marxism, but he adjusted it much more audaciously than he pretended. </p> <p>When I first started writing about Lenin in the early 80s, the trickiest task was to explain how Lenin's ideas were connected with his political activity. Some writers contended that his ideas predetermined the activity, others that the ideas were a disguise for a cynical desire for power. My own position was that neither of these contentions was true, but that Lenin was a man of ideological commitment who nevertheless altered his ideas to suit changing circumstances and new opportunities and threats - and not always for the reasons he gave in public. He had to manage opinion among his associates, his party and society. Sometimes he spoke straight and sometimes he fudged. </p> <p>He genuinely believed humanity's future lay with communism and the creation of a world without political or economic oppression. But he also thought this required a most ruthless temporary class dic tatorship. He needed to get power before he could explain his strategy to supporters among the workers and even inside his party. </p> <p>But Lenin's ideas and activity are just two corners of a triangle. The third is his emotional life, and now that the archives are available, we can work out the nature of the triangular relationship. Lenin was not the robotic politician of legend. He was a flesh-and-blood, over-confident, impatient, brilliant, charming and often troubled revolutionary. His story is incomplete until we take the entire triangle into account. Lenin was 47 before he gained power. For most of his adulthood, he had been an \u00e9migr\u00e9. He might easily have given up and become the provincial lawyer he had trained to be in the 1890s, before he turned to revolutionary activism. But he was sustained by internal drives, and although he did not talk about them, they were constant and powerful. </p> <p> What also emerges from the archives is a sense of the oneness of Lenin. It is sometimes claimed that, as he lay dying, he moderated his dictatorial doctrines. This is supposed to be proved by his call for the removal of Stalin from the party general secretaryship. But the evidence suggests instead that Lenin died a Leninist. Which is to say that he remained an idealist, but this meant to him staying true to the need for revolutionary persecution. Lenin's deathbed disagreements with Stalin were about bureaucratic matters that did not touch on the fundamentals of the one-party state. </p> <p>We can now also see that Lenin's final illness caused him to behave bizarrely in the two years before his death in 1924. When Lenin spoke to his doctor, Liveri Darkevich, he admitted to thinking that he might be going clinically mad. A series of \"obsessions\" were unhinging him. Darkevich heard him pour his heart out: \"A night doomed to insomnia is a truly terrible thing when you have to be ready in the morning for work, work, work without end.\" This tiny episode, which happened when Lenin swung between anger and despair, makes it easier to understand why Stalin managed to survive the criticisms made by Lenin. The other central party leaders had reason to think that Lenin's judgment was no longer to be trusted. </p> <p>Lenin had an enormous impact but he had needed equally enormous luck to make that impact. Without the first world war, Russia would not have plunged into military defeat, economic collapse and administrative disintegration in 1917. Without a radicalised intelligentsia and working class, Lenin would have had few followers and would never have been able to gain power. He made the most of these extraordinary opportunities. Once he had power, he let nothing stand in the way of his keeping it. His successors maintained the basic system of communist rule until Gorbachev dismantled it in the late 80s. </p> <p>Lenin's influence has declined since the fall of the Soviet Union. Marxism-Leninism is ignored even by the Russian Communist party. But many of the social and institutional arrangements of Lenin's regime have yet to be eliminated; the thinking of the Russian people was not changed overnight by the abolition of the USSR; and in China and Cuba he remains a secular saint. The world still lives in his shadow. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert Service's Lenin: A Political Biography is published by Macmillan (\u00a325).</p>",

He had discovered from \"a friend who is a senior director of British Airways\" that flight records are destroyed after two years, so he thought no one could prove that Mrs Aitken was not in Paris on the day when his hotel bill was paid.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Like contestants on Blind Date, non-western writers who live and write in the west are still forced to explain who they are and where they come from. And Egyptian-born Ahdaf Soueif, who writes in English, feels doubly scrutinised. \"You're open to criticism,\" she says, \"of writing in an exotic way about the Arab world.\" </p> <p>She swept to attention last year in Britain when her novel, The Map Of Love, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. But she has also won over Arab critics, who have praised her for writing through an authentic Egyptian consciousness, and who called her first novel, The Eye of the Sun (1992), an Arabic novel written in English. \"That pleases me enormously.\" </p> <p>But these debates don't go away. She was recently at a conference of African writers in Washington DC, some of whom felt that they had a duty to dispel the myths about their own cultures. Soueif is \"wary\" about that position because, as she says, it creates an agenda over and above the craft of writing. </p> <p>Although Soueif writes in English - always at night, for she has a full-time \"day job\" in an Islamic cultural centre - she hears the dialogue in her head in Arabic. In this way she hopes that she can accommodate both the Arab experience and language in her work.</p> <p>Indeed, those complex cultural rituals of greeting, the courtesies, the \"inshallahs\" - the phrases she calls \"comforting\" - flow effortlessly in her English dialogue. And perhaps because Soueif has a PhD in linguistics, she can unselfconsciously include a glossary in which tidbits of information about Arabic roots are revealed: that haram, for example, denotes a sacred space, that the haram of a man is his wife, that hareem (from the same root) means women and that the haramlek is the area of a house reserved for women. </p> <p>All Soueif's work is concerned with women, in their public and private lives, in their struggles to define themselves. The Map of Love, in particular, provides a voice for the haramlek. But not, as Soueif says, as a place where \"women are lounging about waiting for men\". Instead she is aware how rich, \"not amputated\", how supportive these women's communities were - and are. Feminism in Egypt began in the 1880s - with the struggle for education, in which Soueif's own paternal grandmother played a part, writing verses on the education of women and taking part in anti-colonial demonstrations. </p> <p>A century or so on, the discourses about women's identity continue. What is clear to Soueif - and threaded always into her writing - is that the acceptance of the veil doesn't necessarily mean that a woman is \"oppressed, an extremist or wants an Islamicist state\". </p> <p>Soueif has been writing for some 20 years now since since turning her back on a university career (her parents, too, were academics, forced at one stage into low-grade jobs by the British). She had lived in the UK as a small child and had returned as a student. After a stint teaching at Cairo University, she moved back to London, married the poet Ian Hamilton and had two sons. </p> <p>Of her four books, two are collections of short stories - delicate, spare, lyrical.

      "bodyText": "Like contestants on Blind Date, non-western writers who live and write in the west are still forced to explain who they are and where they come from. And Egyptian-born Ahdaf Soueif, who writes in English, feels doubly scrutinised. \"You're open to criticism,\" she says, \"of writing in an exotic way about the Arab world.\" She swept to attention last year in Britain when her novel, The Map Of Love, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. But she has also won over Arab critics, who have praised her for writing through an authentic Egyptian consciousness, and who called her first novel, The Eye of the Sun (1992), an Arabic novel written in English. \"That pleases me enormously.\" But these debates don't go away. She was recently at a conference of African writers in Washington DC, some of whom felt that they had a duty to dispel the myths about their own cultures. Soueif is \"wary\" about that position because, as she says, it creates an agenda over and above the craft of writing. Although Soueif writes in English - always at night, for she has a full-time \"day job\" in an Islamic cultural centre - she hears the dialogue in her head in Arabic. In this way she hopes that she can accommodate both the Arab experience and language in her work. Indeed, those complex cultural rituals of greeting, the courtesies, the \"inshallahs\" - the phrases she calls \"comforting\" - flow effortlessly in her English dialogue. And perhaps because Soueif has a PhD in linguistics, she can unselfconsciously include a glossary in which tidbits of information about Arabic roots are revealed: that haram, for example, denotes a sacred space, that the haram of a man is his wife, that hareem (from the same root) means women and that the haramlek is the area of a house reserved for women. All Soueif's work is concerned with women, in their public and private lives, in their struggles to define themselves. The Map of Love, in particular, provides a voice for the haramlek. But not, as Soueif says, as a place where \"women are lounging about waiting for men\". Instead she is aware how rich, \"not amputated\", how supportive these women's communities were - and are. Feminism in Egypt began in the 1880s - with the struggle for education, in which Soueif's own paternal grandmother played a part, writing verses on the education of women and taking part in anti-colonial demonstrations. A century or so on, the discourses about women's identity continue. What is clear to Soueif - and threaded always into her writing - is that the acceptance of the veil doesn't necessarily mean that a woman is \"oppressed, an extremist or wants an Islamicist state\". Soueif has been writing for some 20 years now since since turning her back on a university career (her parents, too, were academics, forced at one stage into low-grade jobs by the British). She had lived in the UK as a small child and had returned as a student. After a stint teaching at Cairo University, she moved back to London, married the poet Ian Hamilton and had two sons. Of her four books, two are collections of short stories - delicate, spare, lyrical. In contrast, the two novels are unashamedly fat and robust, wide-ranging in style and content, ambitiously embracing history, politics, feminism and romance, whether in Cairo, London, Beirut or New York. She started both novels, she says, by writing separate scenes that had \"pressed in on\" her. From this beginning, there evolved a sense of \"uncovering - like a statue from a piece of marble\". The research alone for The Map of Love took two years, with Soueif combing the SOAS library for books, newspapers and pamphlets that would provide the precise chronological details of Egypt's complex history at the turn of the century as Turkish rule weakened, British imperialism deepened and Egyptian nationalism recharged its energies. The novel, which is to be published in Arabic later this year in a translation by Soueif's mother, turns on the relationship between Egypt and the West - at the beginning and end of the 20th century - through a cross-cultural love affair between Anna, an intrepid Victorian English widow, and Sharif, a dashing (it has to be said) Egyptian nationalist. \"I wanted to make a romantic hero who would also be an Egyptian,\" says Soueif. In its historical narrative, The Map of Love is unhurried and luxurious. \"That is the beauty of the past: there it lies on the table - journals, pictures, a candle-glass, a few books of history,\" Soueif writes. In contrast, in its tales of contemporary Egypt, written almost as history unfolded, there is an urgency, a sense of rushing events. In dealing with the massacre of the tourists at Luxor, Soueif focuses on the government's response - the bewilderment and fear as villagers are rounded up by an unaccountable police force.

      "body": "<p>It was the culmination of four years' toil for Tony Harrison on his monumental theatre work, The Kaisers of Carnuntum, a play in verse. Specifically written to be set in the remains of Marcus Aurelius's Roman stadium at Carnuntum, 40 kilometres outside Vienna, the piece was to have only two performances, in the summer of 1995. The extravagant logistics of the work - which required real lions, tigers and bears - were so complicated that the first time it could be put together was at the dress rehearsal the evening before the first performance. </p> <p>Just as the rehearsal was due to start, a massive thunderstorm broke. As the night wore on the set was washed out, and to the background accompaniment of increasingly restless lions, the rehearsal was finally cancelled in the early hours of the morning. No one would know what the show was like until it was staged the following evening. Harrison was drenched and exhausted after climbing around on rigging in an attempt to lash plastic covers over the set. A member of the crew told him the bad news. His response was unequivocal. \"I couldn't give a fuck\", he said. \"I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world.\" </p> <p>Harrison has always relished the struggle to produce art, and this struggle matched the scale of his ambitious expectations. When the play was staged next day it was a triumph. \"I think it's probably the best thing I've done in the theatre,\" he says. It might have had a brief existence, but the play neatly encapsulates much of Harrison's view of life and art. It was set in the classical world and drew on it to expose the brutality of the Romans as opposed to Harrison's beloved Greeks. </p> <p>It applied the politics of the past to the present and presciently identified - through a line in the play - the then little-known local demagogue J\u00f6rg Haider as a man to watch. It mixed vulgarity with great seriousness and placed Yorkshire vowels - as delivered by the definitive Harrison actor Barrie Rutter - among the words of emperors. And, like earlier Harrison works, it caused a bit of a stir. It was Ezra Pound who asserted that literature is news that stays news, and Tony Harrison is living proof. While the journey from arts page to front page has proved a leap too far for most writers, Harrison takes it in his stride. </p> <p>His habit of breaking out of the literary ghetto is made all the more remarkable in that his varied body of work for the theatre, opera, film, television and print is not only all written in verse but is also steeped in an appreciation of classical literature and culture. The attention of news editors was first sparked by Richard Eyre's 1987 film of his poem v. The potent mix of swearing, Yorkshire accents, football hooliganism and Channel 4 attracted the rabid attentions of rent-a-quote MPs, Mary Whitehouse and the Daily Mail. </p> <p>His 1989 verse film, Blasphemers' Banquet, prompted by the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie, led to more headlines and almost a caricature of an establishment reaction when the Archbishop of Canterbury sent a discreet note to the BBC asking that it be withdrawn. To the BBC's credit it was not. Most recently his very public refusal to be considered for the post of poet laureate - he wrote a poem for this newspaper, setting out his objections - and his accompanying sideswipe at Andrew Motion, who subsequently got the job, sparked another minor media frenzy. This has been kept going by publication of his most recent work, the collection Laureate's Block - which includes that eponymous Guardian poem - and which has been pretty well savaged by the critics. </p> <p>But it is not only through literary rows that Harrison has made the news. In 1995 the Guardian sent him to Bosnia. He wrote a poem while travelling in an armoured vehicle outside Sarajevo. It was filed along with the dispatches of other war correspondents. Much to their chagrin Harrison's was the only piece to be on the front page the next day. So what is it about his work that strikes such a nerve? </p> <p>\"Well for one thing people know what he is talking about,\" says fellow Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage. \"It makes them feel legitimised in joining the argument. It's difficult to imagine some other poets causing a similar stir because no one really understands the context of the poetry. But Tony invites discussion and is not afraid to put himself in the firing line. He senses that it is part of his bardic task.\" </p> <p>This task is often explicitly con frontational across a range of cultural, political and personal fronts. He not so much probes the fissures in himself and in society as sends down depth-charges. In the poem Laureate's Block he reserved the right to \"blast and bollock Blairite Britain\", which includes having a go at friends who step outside his moral or political code. When Richard Eyre accepted a knighthood, Harrison wrote him a poem called \"[untitled]\". When his friend and collaborator Harrison Birtwistle accepted one he wrote the three line English opera, Sir Harry/ Sir Gawain /Surtitles!. </p> <p>\"We had this conversation years ago,\" recalls Eyre. \"I said he'd be the next poet laureate and he said he'd sooner do that than I'd take a knighthood. When I did accept one he sent me this embossed Victorian postcard with the letters RE on it which he had bought intending to send if I ever did take a knighthood. Tony takes his friendships seriously, which means you can fall out with him, but he is a very caring friend.\" </p> <p>\"Honours seem to be the nature of British life,\" says Harrison. \"It's horrible. Maybe I'm mad, but the older I get the less I want to have honours loaded on me. I want to be free and keep my spirit open. If you gradually acquire all this baggage and honour, it inhibits you moving forward. I really admire the great Japanese artists who could change their name three times in a lifetime. You could get rid of one and renew yourself.\" </p> <p>Despite operating under the same name, renewing himself has never seemed a problem. His three major projects over the past year have been in three different forms: film, theatre and a collection of poems, all in verse of course. His adaptation of the medieval Mystery plays, first staged between 1977 and 1985, is on at the (Royal) National Theatre until May. His verse film version of Aeschylus's Prometheus was released last year. It is a powerful and hugely imaginative work but, although well received, had only limited distribution. Most recent has been Laureate's Block, a collection of occasional poems including republican verses. It also includes the poems written in Bosnia, and some touching verses to his schizophrenic son, to a dying friend, and to his mistress. </p> <p>The bad reviews have been vicious. Harrison's increasingly direct approach to his verse has not been universally popular. Robert Potts, reviewing it for this paper, called the collection \"cloth-eared\" and said it read \"like a cruel parody of Tony Harrison\". Simon Armitage, however, sees it differently. \"His work has been moving further and further away from what you might call literature. I don't mean that pejoratively. But it has less in common with the canon of studied literature and more in common with a verse that is trying to gain an audience, rather than what might be called a readership. </p> <p>\"I was taken aback because it was so upfront. I don't know whether it's a bold thing or a bonkers thing. My assumption is that he knows what he is doing. If you look at the earlier work, it is far more complicated and challenging. These poems are like Lowry paintings. It's difficult to tell if they are na\u00efve, or faux naif or just brick-built or what. But he has such a great intellect it makes you think that the poems are strategic. I think these things are done out of choice and not senility.\" </p> <p>The fact that he is currently on the receiving end of acclaim (The Mysteries), indifference (Prometheus) and hostility (Laureate's Block) doesn't seem to surprise Harrison. \"You get early inoculation against the idea of success if you're a poet,\" he says. \"When I published my first collection of sonnets I sold about five copies, now kids study them for A level. Wanting to be successful in that other world of money or fame is not interesting. Poetry isn't like that and it never has been. </p> <p>\"There's something wonderful about having that as the centre of your life, which is untouchable and incorruptible. And I'm not starving. I just want to do the work I want to do. But that can become harder. People say, 'you can do anything you want'. So you tell them what you want and they say that's not quite what they had in mind.\" </p> <p>Harrison has been confounding expectations of what people had in mind for him all his life. The story of how the baker's son from Leeds went to grammar school and became a classicist, and what that meant for him, for the people he left behind and his take on the world at large, has been the starting point for much of his subsequent work. </p> <p>He was born in 1937, the first child of Harry and Florrie Harrison. He has one younger sister. Even at primary school he remembers himself \"ravenous\" for knowledge, and he won a place at Leeds Grammar School and then went on to Leeds University. There is an explanation of where his interest and talent came from in the poem Heredity: \"How you became a poet's a mystery/ Wherever did you get your talent from?/ I say: I had two uncles; Joe and Harry-/ One was a stammerer, the other dumb.\" </p> <p>\"Out of that atmosphere of inarticulation came my ravenousness for articulation, for language,\" he explains. \"I wanted to learn Latin and Greek and become a poet and acquire power over language. I only understand this clearly in retrospect, that my ability to study came from a hunger to learn all the resources of articulation.\" </p> <p>He remembers his parents being nervous about his academic success. \"They felt if you're launched on a path of education, it would take you completely away from them, and it does. I was one of the few people from south Leeds at the school and they were very shy about things like meeting people. Maybe there was some resentment too. They were told I'd be a professor when I was 20-odd and stuff like that.\" </p> <p>Harrison has written extensively about his parents - v. was sparked by obscene graffiti on their headstone in a Leeds cemetery - but says that he only found the right voice to address them after they were dead. \"The shock of their death made me find that. My mother hated my early poems. I didn't give her The Loiners [his sexually and emotionally explicit collection, published in 1970] because I knew she would find it upsetting. A friend got a copy from the library and said to her 'look what I've found by your Tony'. She was shocked. She didn't really learn to accept that I was going to be a writer until she came to the National and saw my adaptation of The Misanthrope in 1973. Laurence Olivier gave her a big kiss and said 'how proud you must be of your little boy.'\" </p> <p>Although his parents never saw the poems he wrote about them, they are still included in his audience. \"I'm a total atheist but I do write things for them. For quite a long time I didn't do justice to my father. He's this rather curmud geonly, hostile presence in some of the earlier pieces. But I have done a poem more recently about him spending days decorating a wedding cake and then it being immediately cut up and eaten. And he had no feeling that that was a tragedy. I think I learned something about how you give your art through that gesture, but I was very late in coming to that realisation.\" </p> <p>Harrison's most anthologised poem, \"Them &amp; [uz]\", comes out of his time at Leeds Grammar where he recalls not being allowed to recite Keats because of his accent. Its bold declaration, \"We'll occupy/your lousy leasehold Poetry\", and revelation that in Wordsworth \"matter/water are full rhymes\" set the tone for his future assault on the cultural barriers that divide the classes. </p> <p>At university he took part in a revue show written by a fellow student, the writer and comedian Barry Cryer. \"In one show everyone had to dress up in very smart dinner jackets and all that,\" recalls Cryer. \"We had to forcibly hold Tony down and apply Brylcreem to his hair. It infuriated him.\" Another university friend and fellow member of Cryer's revue was the Nobel prize-winning writer Wole Soyinka. It was his friendship with Soyinka that contributed to him taking a post in the English department at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria in 1962. </p> <p>Harrison had married his first wife Rosemarie in 1960. Their daughter, Jane, was born the year they moved to Nigeria and their son, Max, the following year. He has three grandchildren. His first collection of poems, Earthworks, was published in 1964, and he and the Irish poet James Simmons, also at the university, worked together on Akin Mahta, a Nigerian version of Aristophanes's comedy Lysistrata, incorporating African music and dance. Works for stage and page have continued in tandem ever since. </p> <p>After four years, Harrison moved to Prague, partly because his wife's family lived in East Germany - her father had been a communist under Hitler - and Czechoslovakia was one of the few places where the whole family could meet. The city's vibrant theatrical life also fed the development of Harrison's drama. \"I went to theatre every day for 18 months. It was fantastic, a really important part of my life. With the official media being censored, in something like Shakespeare you got productions of intense power, and people reading them in terms of news about today from the past. It gave me the sense of the power of what you could unlock from a play from the past.\" </p> <p>The other influence on his theatrical ideas was the variety shows he saw as child in Leeds. \"Music hall was my diet and I think a lot of my work has been a serious metamorphosis of things I saw as a child. It was quite hard to think about verse drama when I started out. It was Eliot and Fry, which I didn't like. I thought they ruined verse drama. But the verse of musicals and of pantomime was wonderful. I remember men playing women and women playing men speaking in verse, and I think those experiences go quite deep.\" </p> <p>Richard Eyre says Harrison has not been yoked to the usual list of great British dramatists because he has chosen to write exclusively in verse. \"Which ironically is the great British tradition, with the greatest British dramatist Shakespeare. Tony is saying here is a medium, verse drama, which has incredible vigour, which uses the source of rhythmic language to distil and provide a pulse for dramatic action. It is a conscious choice for him as it was for Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>By the time Harrison returned home from Prague in 1967 he was determined not to end up teaching in England and decided \"to venture everything on being a poet. It had to be a real job, like my father's.\" And so began his policy of \"it's all verse,\" as he started to work as much for the stage as for the page. The success of his adaptation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope was his big break at the National Theatre, followed by his adaptation of The Oresteia and then The Mysteries. </p> <p>Eyre places his 1990 play, The Trackers Of Oxyrhynchus - in which satyrs with giant phalluses clog dance - among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s. Jocelyn Herbert, doyenne of British theatre design and a long-time Harrison collaborator, acknowledges that his ideas are intrinsically dramatic. \"The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is wonderful for the stage. Some writers just write and have little idea what it will look like, but Tony always knows exactly what he wants.\" </p> <p>He also knows exactly what it should sound like. The Yorkshire actor Barrie Rutter has featured in many Harrison productions. He recalls a time when the accepted wisdom was that \"Rutter couldn't play kings, because of my accent. And here was Harrison writing the greatest drama for voices like mine. He showed that high art needn't be appropriated by received pronunciation. His stuff is tremendous material for an actor, and I love to rock'n'roll on his language. He is very actor conscious and his speeches work every faculty.\" </p> <p>Harrison's poems began to become increasingly direct and simple when he realised his own parents couldn't understand his work. From the time of v. in 1985 he set out on a new route. \"He doesn't distinguish between the lyric, the narrative and the dramatic work,\" says critic Sandie Byrne. \"He illustrates how we shouldn't expect poetry to be homogenous and consistent. It is a wonderfully flexible medium. Sometimes he writes lines of stonking doggerel and that is intentional. The sheer audacity of the bad rhyme is part of the poem. His early works are highly finished and have obviously been through a number of drafts, but things like the Bosnia reportage poems were written at speed. It would almost be an insult to their subject matter for them to be polished in the same way.\" </p> <p>The critic Neil Corcoran is more wary. \"I'm not entirely negative about Tony Harrison,\" he says. \"In his earlier work there's an enormous amount of energy and exuberance. There are lots of ingenious little anecdotes and historical vignettes which are often the instruments of class antagonism and venom. This exuberance makes many of these lyrics very dramatic, especially in his own readings. But I think there's a danger in that. The poems can seem too much merely a performance, with insufficient inwardness and subtlety to sustain repeated readings. Perhaps that element comes to predominate in some of the more recent work, much of which is conceived in a theatrical or cinematic context.\" </p> <p>Corcoran argues that it can be hard to differentiate necessary antagonism to a repressive class system from self-admiration. \"That's to say, the poet celebrating his own triumph in adversity. And this is particularly the case when this theme is repeated as often as it is in Harrison. To my mind, some of what he does in this regard is done with greater complexity by poets such as Douglas Dunn or Seamus Heaney - who, it should be said, are nevertheless both admirers.\" </p> <p>When his name was trotted out in relation to the poet laureateship after Ted Hughes's death, he thought his refusal to be considered was a statement of the obvious. \"Anyone who read my poetry would know that I was the most unlikely person. But people know me as a public poet and thought I was an obvious candidate. I think I was even on the list the time before. People would say we want somebody serious. And I'd say it's not a serious position.\" </p> <p>The fall-out from his refusal was as much personal as literary, and included some unwelcome tabloid scrutiny of his own love life. He and Rosemarie had been divorced in the late 70s and Harrison had married the Greek soprano Teresa Stratas in 1984 after meeting her some years earlier when he adapted the libretto to Smetana's opera The Bartered Bride for the Met in New York. In Laureate's Block he referred to both Stratas and his long-term girlfriend, the actress Sian Thomas. </p> <p>\"Anybody who knows me knows I've been with this woman for years,\" he says. \"It's not new. But the papers hounded both Sian and my wife. It was revolting.\" For all the self-revelatory material in his poetry, particularly in the ongoing sonnet sequence, \"From the School of Eloquence\", Harrison says he is \"not somebody who can easily share personal things with people in conversation. But if I get the poem right there's no embarrassment about sharing it. It's not a simple thing of saying I have this feeling and I've got to get it into this book. You actually discover what the feeling is by writing the poem. Things like rhyme and meter are instruments of discovery. It's like water is used by a potter to keep the clay malleable.\" </p> <p>But he acknowledges that while he can articulate his feelings in verse, that in itself doesn't change the source of pain. These lines were written to his son: </p> <p> I never pray; I scorn religious quacks </p> <p>but do things I despise, for my son, Max, </p> <p>out of unbearable panic at his pain: </p> <p>like light a candle in a church in Spain. </p> <p>\"These poems, like the ones I wrote for my friend Jonathan Silver who was dying, do raise the question as to what does poetry help. It doesn't stop the person from dying. The poems become a kind of looking for fullness and celebration in the darkest situations.\" </p> <p>Harrison has been able to utilise his own periodic descents into darkness - into depression - as another instrument of discovery. \"It's part of my nature to be dark and I bask in it. I absorb it and I use it. And then I have sort of manic weeks and I finish everything. </p> <p>\"Death gives us all our appetite. Eros and Thanatos. The idea of death gives us our sexual impulse. It's not a canceller of appetite, it's an enhancer. If you really are aware of it, then it gives you an immense capacity for living in the here and now. Feeling your sorrows to the full, as well as your joy. And most people have more sorrows than joys.\" </p> <p>Richard Eyre recalls Harrison treating his actors backstage to a sip of champagne from a 2,000-year-old Greek cup before they went on. \"He's the only writer I know who would do something like that. He does have a terrific appetite for the taste of life. And that includes the taste of melancholy; he is a melancholic, not a depressive. He did once say to me that if he couldn't write he would go mad. He has a sense of a soul within him that is fighting for expression and if it didn't legitimise its expression through art would dissolve into madness.\" </p> <p>Over the past decade or so Harrison's art has been increasingly visual, and he is the first poet since Betjeman to establish a regular niche with his verse films. They started in 1987 when he wrote In Loving Memory, four television films about cemeteries. Next was Blasphemers' Banquet in which he placed himself at the table with Voltaire, Omar Khayy\u00e1m, Byron, Moli\u00e8re and Salman Rushdie. Black Daisies For The Bride was his study of Alzheimer's sufferers. He started to direct with his film about economic migrants from Kazakhstan selling tatty Soviet memorabilia in a street market in Athens, and followed it with The Shadow Of Hiroshima, which marked the 50th anniversary of VJ Day. </p> <p>With Prometheus, the story of the titan who stole fire and made the gods' world ours, he follows Shelley in seeing it as an example of class warfare, with Zeus and his henchman Hermes agents of capitalism, and Prometheus a reminder of socialist idealism. His anger at Zeus is deeply personal. On some level he inhabits the classical world as part of his daily life. </p> <p>His contempt for Roman theatre is visceral. \"I loathed the way the Romans adapted almost every ancient Greek theatre into a killing place. Even the great theatre of Dionysus in Athens has marble slabs which are clearly blood-guards so that people in the front row didn't get splashed. For the Greeks, when something terrible happens a messenger would come on and tell you about it in spellbinding language. The ear goes much closer than the eye would ever accept. Their masks always had the eyes and mouth open. </p> <p>\"But the Romans used to get prisoners out of the prison, dress them up as Hercules and literally burn them. It was snuff theatre. It was an expression of power to kill 100 rare ostriches in a morning, but after the Greek theatre, it was such a failure of the imagination.\" </p> <p>Harrison's work has been a lifelong struggle to respect the powers of imagination and make them accessible. Simon Armitage acknowledges that he has blazed a trail for many poets. \"He has allowed my generation to do our own thing without having to worry too much about where we come from and what accents we've got. Trying to write in a way that's representative of our voices was a pitched battle for him.\" </p> <p>And what of Harrison's own perception of his legacy? \"Well, like anyone, I hope the people who knew me will talk about me over a bottle of wine after I've gone. But what I'm proud of is that I can read poems about my parents in Leeds or Bradford, and men especially are suddenly sobbing in the audience. That a short poem has touched them that deeply and brings that kind of response is better than a rave review. </p> <p>\"But I always feel, especially in my fallow periods, that I don't recognise this monster who finishes my work with such intensity. It's like Rumplestiltskin coming in and turning all the straw into gold and then going away again. I've done poems for the page, the stage, the opera house, television, film and newspapers. It's all one work. You know, maybe the life is really about dodging about to achieve moments where the work can happen. And often you fuck up your life in order to get that moment. But that's the way it can be when the muses have your telephone number.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Tony Harrison </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> Leeds, April 30 1937. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Cross Flatts county primary school; Leeds grammar school; Leeds University. </p> <p><strong> Family: </strong> Married Rosemarie Crossfield 1960 (one son, one daughter), marriage dissolved; married Teresa Stratas 1984. </p> <p><strong> Teaching: </strong> English lecturer, Ahmadu Bello University, Nigeria 1962-66; Charles University, Prague 1966-67. </p> <p><strong> Some poetry: </strong> Earthworks 1964; Newcastle Is Peru 1969; The Loiners 1970; Palladas 1975; From the School of Eloquence 1978; v.1985; Selected Poems 1987; A Cold Coming 1991; Laureate's Block 2000. </p> <p><strong> Theatre: </strong> Akin Mahta 1966; The Misanthrope 1973; Phaedra Britannica 1975; Bow Down 1977; The Oresteia 1981; Yan Tan Tethera1983; The Mysteries 1985; The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus 1990; The Kaisers of Carnuntum 1995; The Prince's Play 1996. </p> <p><strong> Some film: </strong> Blasphemers' Banquet 1989;Prometheus 1999. </p> <p>\u0095 Laureate's Block is published by Penguin (\u00a37.99).

      "bodyText": "It was the culmination of four years' toil for Tony Harrison on his monumental theatre work, The Kaisers of Carnuntum, a play in verse. Specifically written to be set in the remains of Marcus Aurelius's Roman stadium at Carnuntum, 40 kilometres outside Vienna, the piece was to have only two performances, in the summer of 1995. The extravagant logistics of the work - which required real lions, tigers and bears - were so complicated that the first time it could be put together was at the dress rehearsal the evening before the first performance. Just as the rehearsal was due to start, a massive thunderstorm broke. As the night wore on the set was washed out, and to the background accompaniment of increasingly restless lions, the rehearsal was finally cancelled in the early hours of the morning. No one would know what the show was like until it was staged the following evening. Harrison was drenched and exhausted after climbing around on rigging in an attempt to lash plastic covers over the set. A member of the crew told him the bad news. His response was unequivocal. \"I couldn't give a fuck\", he said. \"I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world.\" Harrison has always relished the struggle to produce art, and this struggle matched the scale of his ambitious expectations. When the play was staged next day it was a triumph. \"I think it's probably the best thing I've done in the theatre,\" he says. It might have had a brief existence, but the play neatly encapsulates much of Harrison's view of life and art. It was set in the classical world and drew on it to expose the brutality of the Romans as opposed to Harrison's beloved Greeks. It applied the politics of the past to the present and presciently identified - through a line in the play - the then little-known local demagogue J\u00f6rg Haider as a man to watch. It mixed vulgarity with great seriousness and placed Yorkshire vowels - as delivered by the definitive Harrison actor Barrie Rutter - among the words of emperors. And, like earlier Harrison works, it caused a bit of a stir. It was Ezra Pound who asserted that literature is news that stays news, and Tony Harrison is living proof. While the journey from arts page to front page has proved a leap too far for most writers, Harrison takes it in his stride. His habit of breaking out of the literary ghetto is made all the more remarkable in that his varied body of work for the theatre, opera, film, television and print is not only all written in verse but is also steeped in an appreciation of classical literature and culture. The attention of news editors was first sparked by Richard Eyre's 1987 film of his poem v. The potent mix of swearing, Yorkshire accents, football hooliganism and Channel 4 attracted the rabid attentions of rent-a-quote MPs, Mary Whitehouse and the Daily Mail. His 1989 verse film, Blasphemers' Banquet, prompted by the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie, led to more headlines and almost a caricature of an establishment reaction when the Archbishop of Canterbury sent a discreet note to the BBC asking that it be withdrawn. To the BBC's credit it was not. Most recently his very public refusal to be considered for the post of poet laureate - he wrote a poem for this newspaper, setting out his objections - and his accompanying sideswipe at Andrew Motion, who subsequently got the job, sparked another minor media frenzy. This has been kept going by publication of his most recent work, the collection Laureate's Block - which includes that eponymous Guardian poem - and which has been pretty well savaged by the critics. But it is not only through literary rows that Harrison has made the news. In 1995 the Guardian sent him to Bosnia. He wrote a poem while travelling in an armoured vehicle outside Sarajevo. It was filed along with the dispatches of other war correspondents. Much to their chagrin Harrison's was the only piece to be on the front page the next day. So what is it about his work that strikes such a nerve? \"Well for one thing people know what he is talking about,\" says fellow Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage. \"It makes them feel legitimised in joining the argument. It's difficult to imagine some other poets causing a similar stir because no one really understands the context of the poetry. But Tony invites discussion and is not afraid to put himself in the firing line. He senses that it is part of his bardic task.\" This task is often explicitly con frontational across a range of cultural, political and personal fronts. He not so much probes the fissures in himself and in society as sends down depth-charges. In the poem Laureate's Block he reserved the right to \"blast and bollock Blairite Britain\", which includes having a go at friends who step outside his moral or political code. When Richard Eyre accepted a knighthood, Harrison wrote him a poem called \"[untitled]\". When his friend and collaborator Harrison Birtwistle accepted one he wrote the three line English opera, Sir Harry/ Sir Gawain /Surtitles!. \"We had this conversation years ago,\" recalls Eyre. \"I said he'd be the next poet laureate and he said he'd sooner do that than I'd take a knighthood. When I did accept one he sent me this embossed Victorian postcard with the letters RE on it which he had bought intending to send if I ever did take a knighthood. Tony takes his friendships seriously, which means you can fall out with him, but he is a very caring friend.\" \"Honours seem to be the nature of British life,\" says Harrison. \"It's horrible. Maybe I'm mad, but the older I get the less I want to have honours loaded on me. I want to be free and keep my spirit open. If you gradually acquire all this baggage and honour, it inhibits you moving forward. I really admire the great Japanese artists who could change their name three times in a lifetime. You could get rid of one and renew yourself.\" Despite operating under the same name, renewing himself has never seemed a problem. His three major projects over the past year have been in three different forms: film, theatre and a collection of poems, all in verse of course. His adaptation of the medieval Mystery plays, first staged between 1977 and 1985, is on at the (Royal) National Theatre until May. His verse film version of Aeschylus's Prometheus was released last year. It is a powerful and hugely imaginative work but, although well received, had only limited distribution. Most recent has been Laureate's Block, a collection of occasional poems including republican verses. It also includes the poems written in Bosnia, and some touching verses to his schizophrenic son, to a dying friend, and to his mistress. The bad reviews have been vicious. Harrison's increasingly direct approach to his verse has not been universally popular. Robert Potts, reviewing it for this paper, called the collection \"cloth-eared\" and said it read \"like a cruel parody of Tony Harrison\". Simon Armitage, however, sees it differently. \"His work has been moving further and further away from what you might call literature. I don't mean that pejoratively. But it has less in common with the canon of studied literature and more in common with a verse that is trying to gain an audience, rather than what might be called a readership. \"I was taken aback because it was so upfront. I don't know whether it's a bold thing or a bonkers thing. My assumption is that he knows what he is doing. If you look at the earlier work, it is far more complicated and challenging. These poems are like Lowry paintings. It's difficult to tell if they are na\u00efve, or faux naif or just brick-built or what. But he has such a great intellect it makes you think that the poems are strategic. I think these things are done out of choice and not senility.\" The fact that he is currently on the receiving end of acclaim (The Mysteries), indifference (Prometheus) and hostility (Laureate's Block) doesn't seem to surprise Harrison. \"You get early inoculation against the idea of success if you're a poet,\" he says. \"When I published my first collection of sonnets I sold about five copies, now kids study them for A level. Wanting to be successful in that other world of money or fame is not interesting. Poetry isn't like that and it never has been. \"There's something wonderful about having that as the centre of your life, which is untouchable and incorruptible. And I'm not starving. I just want to do the work I want to do. But that can become harder. People say, 'you can do anything you want'. So you tell them what you want and they say that's not quite what they had in mind.\" Harrison has been confounding expectations of what people had in mind for him all his life. The story of how the baker's son from Leeds went to grammar school and became a classicist, and what that meant for him, for the people he left behind and his take on the world at large, has been the starting point for much of his subsequent work. He was born in 1937, the first child of Harry and Florrie Harrison. He has one younger sister. Even at primary school he remembers himself \"ravenous\" for knowledge, and he won a place at Leeds Grammar School and then went on to Leeds University. There is an explanation of where his interest and talent came from in the poem Heredity: \"How you became a poet's a mystery/ Wherever did you get your talent from?/ I say: I had two uncles; Joe and Harry-/ One was a stammerer, the other dumb.\" \"Out of that atmosphere of inarticulation came my ravenousness for articulation, for language,\" he explains. \"I wanted to learn Latin and Greek and become a poet and acquire power over language. I only understand this clearly in retrospect, that my ability to study came from a hunger to learn all the resources of articulation.\" He remembers his parents being nervous about his academic success. \"They felt if you're launched on a path of education, it would take you completely away from them, and it does. I was one of the few people from south Leeds at the school and they were very shy about things like meeting people. Maybe there was some resentment too. They were told I'd be a professor when I was 20-odd and stuff like that.\" Harrison has written extensively about his parents - v. was sparked by obscene graffiti on their headstone in a Leeds cemetery - but says that he only found the right voice to address them after they were dead. \"The shock of their death made me find that. My mother hated my early poems. I didn't give her The Loiners [his sexually and emotionally explicit collection, published in 1970] because I knew she would find it upsetting. A friend got a copy from the library and said to her 'look what I've found by your Tony'. She was shocked. She didn't really learn to accept that I was going to be a writer until she came to the National and saw my adaptation of The Misanthrope in 1973. Laurence Olivier gave her a big kiss and said 'how proud you must be of your little boy.'\" Although his parents never saw the poems he wrote about them, they are still included in his audience. \"I'm a total atheist but I do write things for them. For quite a long time I didn't do justice to my father. He's this rather curmud geonly, hostile presence in some of the earlier pieces. But I have done a poem more recently about him spending days decorating a wedding cake and then it being immediately cut up and eaten. And he had no feeling that that was a tragedy. I think I learned something about how you give your art through that gesture, but I was very late in coming to that realisation.\" Harrison's most anthologised poem, \"Them &amp; [uz]\", comes out of his time at Leeds Grammar where he recalls not being allowed to recite Keats because of his accent. Its bold declaration, \"We'll occupy/your lousy leasehold Poetry\", and revelation that in Wordsworth \"matter/water are full rhymes\" set the tone for his future assault on the cultural barriers that divide the classes. At university he took part in a revue show written by a fellow student, the writer and comedian Barry Cryer. \"In one show everyone had to dress up in very smart dinner jackets and all that,\" recalls Cryer. \"We had to forcibly hold Tony down and apply Brylcreem to his hair. It infuriated him.\" Another university friend and fellow member of Cryer's revue was the Nobel prize-winning writer Wole Soyinka. It was his friendship with Soyinka that contributed to him taking a post in the English department at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria in 1962. Harrison had married his first wife Rosemarie in 1960. Their daughter, Jane, was born the year they moved to Nigeria and their son, Max, the following year. He has three grandchildren. His first collection of poems, Earthworks, was published in 1964, and he and the Irish poet James Simmons, also at the university, worked together on Akin Mahta, a Nigerian version of Aristophanes's comedy Lysistrata, incorporating African music and dance. Works for stage and page have continued in tandem ever since. After four years, Harrison moved to Prague, partly because his wife's family lived in East Germany - her father had been a communist under Hitler - and Czechoslovakia was one of the few places where the whole family could meet. The city's vibrant theatrical life also fed the development of Harrison's drama. \"I went to theatre every day for 18 months. It was fantastic, a really important part of my life. With the official media being censored, in something like Shakespeare you got productions of intense power, and people reading them in terms of news about today from the past. It gave me the sense of the power of what you could unlock from a play from the past.\" The other influence on his theatrical ideas was the variety shows he saw as child in Leeds. \"Music hall was my diet and I think a lot of my work has been a serious metamorphosis of things I saw as a child. It was quite hard to think about verse drama when I started out. It was Eliot and Fry, which I didn't like. I thought they ruined verse drama. But the verse of musicals and of pantomime was wonderful. I remember men playing women and women playing men speaking in verse, and I think those experiences go quite deep.\" Richard Eyre says Harrison has not been yoked to the usual list of great British dramatists because he has chosen to write exclusively in verse. \"Which ironically is the great British tradition, with the greatest British dramatist Shakespeare. Tony is saying here is a medium, verse drama, which has incredible vigour, which uses the source of rhythmic language to distil and provide a pulse for dramatic action. It is a conscious choice for him as it was for Shakespeare.\" By the time Harrison returned home from Prague in 1967 he was determined not to end up teaching in England and decided \"to venture everything on being a poet. It had to be a real job, like my father's.\" And so began his policy of \"it's all verse,\" as he started to work as much for the stage as for the page. The success of his adaptation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope was his big break at the National Theatre, followed by his adaptation of The Oresteia and then The Mysteries. Eyre places his 1990 play, The Trackers Of Oxyrhynchus - in which satyrs with giant phalluses clog dance - among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s. Jocelyn Herbert, doyenne of British theatre design and a long-time Harrison collaborator, acknowledges that his ideas are intrinsically dramatic. \"The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is wonderful for the stage. Some writers just write and have little idea what it will look like, but Tony always knows exactly what he wants.\" He also knows exactly what it should sound like. The Yorkshire actor Barrie Rutter has featured in many Harrison productions. He recalls a time when the accepted wisdom was that \"Rutter couldn't play kings, because of my accent. And here was Harrison writing the greatest drama for voices like mine. He showed that high art needn't be appropriated by received pronunciation. His stuff is tremendous material for an actor, and I love to rock'n'roll on his language. He is very actor conscious and his speeches work every faculty.\" Harrison's poems began to become increasingly direct and simple when he realised his own parents couldn't understand his work. From the time of v. in 1985 he set out on a new route. \"He doesn't distinguish between the lyric, the narrative and the dramatic work,\" says critic Sandie Byrne. \"He illustrates how we shouldn't expect poetry to be homogenous and consistent. It is a wonderfully flexible medium. Sometimes he writes lines of stonking doggerel and that is intentional. The sheer audacity of the bad rhyme is part of the poem. His early works are highly finished and have obviously been through a number of drafts, but things like the Bosnia reportage poems were written at speed. It would almost be an insult to their subject matter for them to be polished in the same way.\" The critic Neil Corcoran is more wary. \"I'm not entirely negative about Tony Harrison,\" he says. \"In his earlier work there's an enormous amount of energy and exuberance.

And this is particularly the case when this theme is repeated as often as it is in Harrison. To my mind, some of what he does in this regard is done with greater complexity by poets such as Douglas Dunn or Seamus Heaney - who, it should be said, are nevertheless both admirers.\" When his name was trotted out in relation to the poet laureateship after Ted Hughes's death, he thought his refusal to be considered was a statement of the obvious. \"Anyone who read my poetry would know that I was the most unlikely person. But people know me as a public poet and thought I was an obvious candidate. I think I was even on the list the time before. People would say we want somebody serious. And I'd say it's not a serious position.\" The fall-out from his refusal was as much personal as literary, and included some unwelcome tabloid scrutiny of his own love life. He and Rosemarie had been divorced in the late 70s and Harrison had married the Greek soprano Teresa Stratas in 1984 after meeting her some years earlier when he adapted the libretto to Smetana's opera The Bartered Bride for the Met in New York. In Laureate's Block he referred to both Stratas and his long-term girlfriend, the actress Sian Thomas. \"Anybody who knows me knows I've been with this woman for years,\" he says. \"It's not new. But the papers hounded both Sian and my wife. It was revolting.\" For all the self-revelatory material in his poetry, particularly in the ongoing sonnet sequence, \"From the School of Eloquence\", Harrison says he is \"not somebody who can easily share personal things with people in conversation. But if I get the poem right there's no embarrassment about sharing it. It's not a simple thing of saying I have this feeling and I've got to get it into this book. You actually discover what the feeling is by writing the poem. Things like rhyme and meter are instruments of discovery. It's like water is used by a potter to keep the clay malleable.\" But he acknowledges that while he can articulate his feelings in verse, that in itself doesn't change the source of pain. These lines were written to his son: I never pray; I scorn religious quacks but do things I despise, for my son, Max, out of unbearable panic at his pain: like light a candle in a church in Spain. \"These poems, like the ones I wrote for my friend Jonathan Silver who was dying, do raise the question as to what does poetry help. It doesn't stop the person from dying. The poems become a kind of looking for fullness and celebration in the darkest situations.\" Harrison has been able to utilise his own periodic descents into darkness - into depression - as another instrument of discovery. \"It's part of my nature to be dark and I bask in it. I absorb it and I use it. And then I have sort of manic weeks and I finish everything. \"Death gives us all our appetite. Eros and Thanatos. The idea of death gives us our sexual impulse. It's not a canceller of appetite, it's an enhancer. If you really are aware of it, then it gives you an immense capacity for living in the here and now. Feeling your sorrows to the full, as well as your joy. And most people have more sorrows than joys.\" Richard Eyre recalls Harrison treating his actors backstage to a sip of champagne from a 2,000-year-old Greek cup before they went on. \"He's the only writer I know who would do something like that. He does have a terrific appetite for the taste of life. And that includes the taste of melancholy; he is a melancholic, not a depressive. He did once say to me that if he couldn't write he would go mad. He has a sense of a soul within him that is fighting for expression and if it didn't legitimise its expression through art would dissolve into madness.\" Over the past decade or so Harrison's art has been increasingly visual, and he is the first poet since Betjeman to establish a regular niche with his verse films. They started in 1987 when he wrote In Loving Memory, four television films about cemeteries. Next was Blasphemers' Banquet in which he placed himself at the table with Voltaire, Omar Khayy\u00e1m, Byron, Moli\u00e8re and Salman Rushdie. Black Daisies For The Bride was his study of Alzheimer's sufferers. He started to direct with his film about economic migrants from Kazakhstan selling tatty Soviet memorabilia in a street market in Athens, and followed it with The Shadow Of Hiroshima, which marked the 50th anniversary of VJ Day. With Prometheus, the story of the titan who stole fire and made the gods' world ours, he follows Shelley in seeing it as an example of class warfare, with Zeus and his henchman Hermes agents of capitalism, and Prometheus a reminder of socialist idealism. His anger at Zeus is deeply personal. On some level he inhabits the classical world as part of his daily life. His contempt for Roman theatre is visceral. \"I loathed the way the Romans adapted almost every ancient Greek theatre into a killing place. Even the great theatre of Dionysus in Athens has marble slabs which are clearly blood-guards so that people in the front row didn't get splashed. For the Greeks, when something terrible happens a messenger would come on and tell you about it in spellbinding language. The ear goes much closer than the eye would ever accept. Their masks always had the eyes and mouth open. \"But the Romans used to get prisoners out of the prison, dress them up as Hercules and literally burn them. It was snuff theatre. It was an expression of power to kill 100 rare ostriches in a morning, but after the Greek theatre, it was such a failure of the imagination.\" Harrison's work has been a lifelong struggle to respect the powers of imagination and make them accessible. Simon Armitage acknowledges that he has blazed a trail for many poets. \"He has allowed my generation to do our own thing without having to worry too much about where we come from and what accents we've got. Trying to write in a way that's representative of our voices was a pitched battle for him.\" And what of Harrison's own perception of his legacy? \"Well, like anyone, I hope the people who knew me will talk about me over a bottle of wine after I've gone. But what I'm proud of is that I can read poems about my parents in Leeds or Bradford, and men especially are suddenly sobbing in the audience. That a short poem has touched them that deeply and brings that kind of response is better than a rave review. \"But I always feel, especially in my fallow periods, that I don't recognise this monster who finishes my work with such intensity. It's like Rumplestiltskin coming in and turning all the straw into gold and then going away again. I've done poems for the page, the stage, the opera house, television, film and newspapers. It's all one work. You know, maybe the life is really about dodging about to achieve moments where the work can happen. And often you fuck up your life in order to get that moment. But that's the way it can be when the muses have your telephone number.\" Life at a glance: Tony Harrison Born: Leeds, April 30 1937.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> The Comedy Writer</strong><br>Peter Farrelly <br>Faber, \u00a39.99, 366pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502090058,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Novelists write screenplays all the time, so why shouldn't film directors write fiction? Recent examples include Ethan Coen (a short-story collection, Gates of Eden), Gus van Sant (a novel, Pink), and Harmony Korine (a scrappy prose collage, A Crack-Up at the Race Riots). </p> <p>But Peter Farrelly (celebrated for virtually inventing, along with his brother Bobby, the modern gross-out movie: Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary), is actually on his second novel - the first, Outside Providence, was completed a decade ago when Farrelly's Hollywood career was only just getting off the ground. </p> <p>Unlike his book-writing peers, Farrelly has steered conspicuously clear of the brainy end of the film-making spectrum - the brothers' debut, Dumb and Dumber, was roundly accused of precipitating the intellectual decline of the entire western hemisphere. Here Farrelly shows that you have to be truly smart to appear that dumb. In stark contrast to his primary-colour, elbow-in-the-ribs, head-down-the-toilet film-making, Farrelly writes a low-key, melancholic prose, wandering from vignette to vignette with an oblique but assured narrative drive. </p> <p>He has certainly taken to heart the dictum that you should write about what you know. Outside Providence fed directly from his experiences as a teenager in Rhode Island; The Comedy Writer details the uncertainties of an aspiring scriptwriter in Los Angeles. Chronicles of the Hollywood underbelly - both true and fictional - are meat and drink to the reading public these days, and Farrelly's contribution to the genre comes over like a cross between Rob Long's Conversations with My Agent and Bruce Wagner's sorely overlooked Force Majeure; a mix of couldn't-make-it-up powerplays and the wretchedness to which industry bottom-feeders inevitably succumb. </p> <p>There is the genuine tang of authenticity in Farrelly's account of his protagonist, Henry Halloran, attempting to negotiate the prickly worlds of agency representation, production deals and TV pitch sessions. In real life, the Farrelly brothers offered a storyline for Seinfeld that later became the celebrated episode \"The Virgin\" (the one in which Jerry's girlfriend won't have sex with him). The whole sorry incident is reproduced here in all its ambiguous humiliations - with Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld mentioned by name.</p> <p>Farrelly also recounts a particularly piquant incident which, whether true or not, perfectly distills the Faustian pact Hollywood demands of its inmates - Halloran is required, by a powerful producer with whom he has just lunched, to perjure himself in regard to a road-traffic accident in which his benefactor is clearly culpable. Morality, as ever, is the victim of showbiz aspirations. </p> <p>Farrelly's novel is, however, considerably more than another unspooling of life in the Hollywood shark-tank. Lacing together the anecdotes about celebrity spotting and development meetings is a subtly observed, genuinely funny and cheerfully obscene study of a 33-year-old man in emotional crisis.</p> <p>Halloran heads out west in the throes of a relationship breakdown (his \"spec\" script is called How I Won Her Back); once in LA, he has to contend with a stream of rejections from one cantilevered Hollywood woman after another, a rapidly burgeoning hypochondria (\"I haven't had many men ask for mammograms recently\") and, most significantly, an unwelcome entanglement with the sister of a woman he watches commit suicide three days after he arrives. </p> <p>Halloran's reaction to this suicide - another item, apparently, from the Farrelly scrapbook - is the reader's way into his convoluted inner life. His is an uneasy participation in the Hollywood treadmill: he observes the unreflecting hedonism around him with an eager but appalled eye. And his scriptwriting, it seems, is his method of filtering his experience, of mediating his own web of human relationships. </p> <p>There's also a gallery of hilarious modern grotesques - from the wannabe player who adopts a Jewish name (\"Herb Silverman\") to gain studio-executive credibility to the near-demented movie-maker who is hooked by Halloran's serial-killer pitch \"The Ice Cream Man\" (tagline: No More Mr Softee).

      "bodyText": "The Comedy Writer Peter Farrelly Faber, \u00a39.99, 366pp Buy it at BOL Novelists write screenplays all the time, so why shouldn't film directors write fiction? Recent examples include Ethan Coen (a short-story collection, Gates of Eden), Gus van Sant (a novel, Pink), and Harmony Korine (a scrappy prose collage, A Crack-Up at the Race Riots). But Peter Farrelly (celebrated for virtually inventing, along with his brother Bobby, the modern gross-out movie: Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary), is actually on his second novel - the first, Outside Providence, was completed a decade ago when Farrelly's Hollywood career was only just getting off the ground. Unlike his book-writing peers, Farrelly has steered conspicuously clear of the brainy end of the film-making spectrum - the brothers' debut, Dumb and Dumber, was roundly accused of precipitating the intellectual decline of the entire western hemisphere. Here Farrelly shows that you have to be truly smart to appear that dumb. In stark contrast to his primary-colour, elbow-in-the-ribs, head-down-the-toilet film-making, Farrelly writes a low-key, melancholic prose, wandering from vignette to vignette with an oblique but assured narrative drive. He has certainly taken to heart the dictum that you should write about what you know. Outside Providence fed directly from his experiences as a teenager in Rhode Island; The Comedy Writer details the uncertainties of an aspiring scriptwriter in Los Angeles. Chronicles of the Hollywood underbelly - both true and fictional - are meat and drink to the reading public these days, and Farrelly's contribution to the genre comes over like a cross between Rob Long's Conversations with My Agent and Bruce Wagner's sorely overlooked Force Majeure; a mix of couldn't-make-it-up powerplays and the wretchedness to which industry bottom-feeders inevitably succumb. There is the genuine tang of authenticity in Farrelly's account of his protagonist, Henry Halloran, attempting to negotiate the prickly worlds of agency representation, production deals and TV pitch sessions. In real life, the Farrelly brothers offered a storyline for Seinfeld that later became the celebrated episode \"The Virgin\" (the one in which Jerry's girlfriend won't have sex with him). The whole sorry incident is reproduced here in all its ambiguous humiliations - with Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld mentioned by name. Farrelly also recounts a particularly piquant incident which, whether true or not, perfectly distills the Faustian pact Hollywood demands of its inmates - Halloran is required, by a powerful producer with whom he has just lunched, to perjure himself in regard to a road-traffic accident in which his benefactor is clearly culpable. Morality, as ever, is the victim of showbiz aspirations. Farrelly's novel is, however, considerably more than another unspooling of life in the Hollywood shark-tank. Lacing together the anecdotes about celebrity spotting and development meetings is a subtly observed, genuinely funny and cheerfully obscene study of a 33-year-old man in emotional crisis. Halloran heads out west in the throes of a relationship breakdown (his \"spec\" script is called How I Won Her Back); once in LA, he has to contend with a stream of rejections from one cantilevered Hollywood woman after another, a rapidly burgeoning hypochondria (\"I haven't had many men ask for mammograms recently\") and, most significantly, an unwelcome entanglement with the sister of a woman he watches commit suicide three days after he arrives. Halloran's reaction to this suicide - another item, apparently, from the Farrelly scrapbook - is the reader's way into his convoluted inner life. His is an uneasy participation in the Hollywood treadmill: he observes the unreflecting hedonism around him with an eager but appalled eye. And his scriptwriting, it seems, is his method of filtering his experience, of mediating his own web of human relationships. There's also a gallery of hilarious modern grotesques - from the wannabe player who adopts a Jewish name (\"Herb Silverman\") to gain studio-executive credibility to the near-demented movie-maker who is hooked by Halloran's serial-killer pitch \"The Ice Cream Man\" (tagline: No More Mr Softee). The Comedy Writer is a comic achievement of considerable proportions; frighteningly confessional in places, but run through with remorselessly self-deprecating humour. In his unabashed recycling of his most intimate experiences, Farrelly offers himself as something of a West Coast Philip Roth.",

And its subject matter? Ping-pong. Excuse me, but can you write a novel about ping-pong? </p> <p>So if this was a duff novel, then, why did I keep coming back to it when the alternatives palled? Why did the alternatives pall in the first place? Why did I laugh so much during it? (Although not as loud and long as I had during his previous, No More Mister Nice Guy, admittedly.) And why, most pertinently of all, did I find Jacobson's cadences, rhythms and vocabulary (a particularly rich broth of Mancunian Yiddish) implanted in my brain for what seemed like weeks afterwards? Is this what duff novels do? Give me another one, then. </p> <p>Part of the problem, I suspect, is that as Jacobson continues to mine the story of his life for his novels, he perhaps finds himself running ahead of us, himself even, and using a kind of shorthand for characterisation, forgetful of the fact that not everyone is going to be as up to speed on the matter as himself, or indeed his fans. The Mighty Walzer is about Oliver Walzer, a shy and bookish Jewish boy from Manchester. We have been here before, but this time, the narrator discovers that he is absolutely brilliant at ping-pong. Is the information that Jacobson was, too, relevant? </p> <p>Well, yes and no. It certainly means that he can write about the game with not only style but authority. And if he also chooses to write about his hour-long masturbation sessions in the family khazi, when he presumably realises that he is not the first writer to cross such territory, then we can assume that maybe he is writing about that with authority, too. Although perhaps this is not an avenue we should pursue. </p> <p>No, if the story has a fault, it is that at times it seems as if Jacobson has something else on his mind. Another story altogether, perhaps (the next one?); or just maintaining the flick and vigour of his prose, and if the price of this means that we find it hard to distinguish between a few of his ping-pong pals, or note that the brief Cambridge section seems almost contemptuously scanty, then so be it. If it also means that we get passages like the following, in which the young Walzer imagines chewing out his headmaster for not hymning his talent and success to the rest of the school, then I don't think we really have much to complain about. </p> <p>\"Is it too much for you to bear, you yiddenfeit, you anti-Semitic piece of crap, that we should be good at a game and win scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge? Is that more than an erstwhile fucking Church of England grammar school can swallow? Well, prepare to swallow more, shithead. Meet the master race. You're looking at a double starred first and the next World Ping-Pong Champion. Won't that be something for you to ignore in favour of how Albert Shaygets came last in the All Radcliffe fishing gala with an already dead mackerel measuring a quarter of an inch - we're all proud of you Albert, you dim-witted freckled little snub nose petseleh, you!\"</p>",

Part of the problem, I suspect, is that as Jacobson continues to mine the story of his life for his novels, he perhaps finds himself running ahead of us, himself even, and using a kind of shorthand for characterisation, forgetful of the fact that not everyone is going to be as up to speed on the matter as himself, or indeed his fans. The Mighty Walzer is about Oliver Walzer, a shy and bookish Jewish boy from Manchester. We have been here before, but this time, the narrator discovers that he is absolutely brilliant at ping-pong. Is the information that Jacobson was, too, relevant? Well, yes and no. It certainly means that he can write about the game with not only style but authority. And if he also chooses to write about his hour-long masturbation sessions in the family khazi, when he presumably realises that he is not the first writer to cross such territory, then we can assume that maybe he is writing about that with authority, too. Although perhaps this is not an avenue we should pursue. No, if the story has a fault, it is that at times it seems as if Jacobson has something else on his mind. Another story altogether, perhaps (the next one?); or just maintaining the flick and vigour of his prose, and if the price of this means that we find it hard to distinguish between a few of his ping-pong pals, or note that the brief Cambridge section seems almost contemptuously scanty, then so be it. If it also means that we get passages like the following, in which the young Walzer imagines chewing out his headmaster for not hymning his talent and success to the rest of the school, then I don't think we really have much to complain about. \"Is it too much for you to bear, you yiddenfeit, you anti-Semitic piece of crap, that we should be good at a game and win scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge? Is that more than an erstwhile fucking Church of England grammar school can swallow? Well, prepare to swallow more, shithead. Meet the master race. You're looking at a double starred first and the next World Ping-Pong Champion. Won't that be something for you to ignore in favour of how Albert Shaygets came last in the All Radcliffe fishing gala with an already dead mackerel measuring a quarter of an inch - we're all proud of you Albert, you dim-witted freckled little snub nose petseleh, you!\"",

We need to bring in the right people and it's a very successful scheme.\" CV to date: Trained as an accountant with British Steel, moved to BOC and to S&amp;N in 1979 where he has held senior finance director posts within the group, moving to his current post four years ago. Stats and facts: Largest UK brewer; owner of Center Parcs &amp; Pontins and more than 2,500 pubs. \"My job is to ensure the continuous improvement of controls and procedures in the group,\" says Jim. \"In addition, I have to cover all the corporate governance requirements, and provide high quality finance staff for the group.\" Job buzz? \"Trying to add value to the process and bringing in the right people who can contribute to the future of the business.\" Must-have qualities: \"Graduate trainees in audit must not only be good accountants but also have good inter-personal skills in dealing with board members in group companies. We look for those who can stand on their feet and present information.\" Lyndsey Strachan Aged 23 Chartered accountancy trainee Scottish &amp; Newcastle Lyndsey Strachan did law and French at Glasgow University, but was keen on a a commercial career . \"I didn't know precisely what I wanted to do,\" she says, \" but I was certainly interested in the financial side.\" She applied to join the S&amp;N accountancy trainee scheme. \"The selection process involved psychometric testing and an assessment day which included a presentation and interviews,\" she recalls. Entries to date: She joined the three-year scheme in 1998 and the first 12 months were spent studying accountancy. Over the past year she has been working on various group audits and secondments. Training is a mix of block release study and homework for accountancy exams - the finals of which Lyndsey sits in June 2001. During this time she is allocated a counsellor - a senior chartered accountant - and her work is subject to regular appraisals. She believes S&amp;N is a good place for graduates - and the six who are on the scheme at any one time get together regularly during the year. Next move? \"When I qualify there are a variety of options for a financial role within the group.\" \u0095 For more details visit the website www.scottish-newcastle.com",

This is the most deceitful act against teachers sought by a government for at least 30 years. </p> <p>\"Nothing as devious, deceitful and manipulative as this was ever done by the Tories. This government has sunk to new lows in the staff rooms,\" he said. </p> <p>The union's legal action will centre on an allegation that the regulation is based on the wrong statute. Ministers used a 1991 act about teachers' pay and conditions of service instead of legislation in 1986 covering appraisal of teachers. </p> <p>Mr McAvoy said the government failed to consult teachers about the change, as it should have done under the 1991 act. </p> <p>He accused ministers of rushing the procedure through to avoid embarrassment in the Welsh assembly where there is a majority against assessing teachers against their pupils' test and exam results. Decisions under the 1986 act would have been devolved to the assembly, but regulations under the 1991 law could be imposed from Westminster. \"They know the Welsh assembly won't like it and they want to deny them the chance to vote on it,\" Mr McAvoy said. </p> <p>The union hopes the courts will decide the matter before its annual conference in Harrogate over Easter. \"If this fails, we will take strike action in schools, subject to the necessary balloting, to protect teachers from being asked to inform on each other,\" the general secretary said. </p> <p>When teachers were refused a performance bonus they would not know whether to blame the external assessor or the colleague who might have said something bad about their performance. </p> <p>\"It's a form of snooping ... It will destroy professional teamwork. Teachers will be constantly suspicious of each other,\" he said. </p> <p>A senior education department source said the union was indulging in a mistaken conspiracy theory. \"We used the most recent legislation to set up a system for line managers to provide an assessment about teachers under their command. </p> <p>\"It would be bizarre if heads did not take the the views of line managers into account when assessing whether teachers should get a \u00a32,000 pay rise.\" </p> <p>He said the government never intended to ask rank and file teachers to \"snoop\" on their colleagues. The assessments would be made by department heads. </p> <p>\"This is not about colleagues assessing each other. It is about heads of department giving their views as part of the process of saying whether staff should get the pay increase.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, said children should be entitled to after-school facilities, including sports, arts, computer and homework clubs.

He accused ministers of rushing the procedure through to avoid embarrassment in the Welsh assembly where there is a majority against assessing teachers against their pupils' test and exam results. Decisions under the 1986 act would have been devolved to the assembly, but regulations under the 1991 law could be imposed from Westminster. \"They know the Welsh assembly won't like it and they want to deny them the chance to vote on it,\" Mr McAvoy said. The union hopes the courts will decide the matter before its annual conference in Harrogate over Easter. \"If this fails, we will take strike action in schools, subject to the necessary balloting, to protect teachers from being asked to inform on each other,\" the general secretary said. When teachers were refused a performance bonus they would not know whether to blame the external assessor or the colleague who might have said something bad about their performance. \"It's a form of snooping ... It will destroy professional teamwork. Teachers will be constantly suspicious of each other,\" he said. A senior education department source said the union was indulging in a mistaken conspiracy theory. \"We used the most recent legislation to set up a system for line managers to provide an assessment about teachers under their command. \"It would be bizarre if heads did not take the the views of line managers into account when assessing whether teachers should get a \u00a32,000 pay rise.\" He said the government never intended to ask rank and file teachers to \"snoop\" on their colleagues. The assessments would be made by department heads. \"This is not about colleagues assessing each other. It is about heads of department giving their views as part of the process of saying whether staff should get the pay increase.\" \u0095 Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, said children should be entitled to after-school facilities, including sports, arts, computer and homework clubs. A report by the Schools Plus policy team on improving educational chances in disadvantaged areas said pupils should have at least three hours of out of school hours activities a week.",

      "body": "<p>For Rover, and British manufacturing as a whole, the innovation was state-of-the-art. Screens cut off a section of the canteen at Longbridge this week, and behind them officials from the government's employment service were setting up the car industry's first in-house job centre. </p> <p>It was not an instant success. Sullen workers at the canteen's formica-top tables munched away with their backs to the unwelcome intruder, trying to pretend that this well-meant gesture of help and the little white index cards of job vacancies stuck on to boards were not really there. </p> <p>\"We've had a few inquiries but people are mainly asking 'what if?' questions. They're still waiting for the uncertainty to be resolved,\" said Jon Dews, an employment adviser. </p> <p>In the forecourt outside, a worker in grey overalls passed a group of managers standing on the front steps. \"Heard anything yet?\" he called out without waiting for an answer. In this brutal disaster, where decisions are taken in global boardrooms far away, local executives are as out of touch as everyone else. </p> <p>The first shock of BMW's decision to sell Rover to the venture capitalists Alchemy has faded, but anger and a powerful sense of betrayal hang over the plant. There is also fear. The word has gone out from BMW to restrict press access to the site, and workers have been warned not to speak to reporters. So everyone insists you disguise their name and job description for fear that their redundancy terms might be affected. </p> <p>The only exceptions are full-time union officials. \"I don't think anyone here wants to work in the car industry again,\" snaps Adrian Ross, a shop steward for the Transport and General Workers' Union. \"Rover was two years away from being a very profitable business. On that basis you would tell youngsters to work here, but not now.\" </p> <p>A man from Rover's public relations team hurries over like a prison officer and urges me out. Visiting time is up. I am only in the building because Tessa Jowell, the employment minister, is talking to staff upstairs. </p> <p><strong> Trapped</strong><br> </p> <p> To add to their anger, workers are furious that on the same day it announced it was selling Rover BMW stopped its voluntary redundancy scheme. When BMW slimmed the workforce two years ago, it offered packages that were considered generous. \"Now people are trapped here like prisoners,\" Kumar, who works as a process engineer, tells me later. \"If they try to find a new job today and give notice, they will lose their redundancy. If they stay on, there's no guarantee they will get any more than the minimum one week for every year of service.\" </p> <p>Neither BMW nor Alchemy has made it clear who is responsible for redundancy and what they will pay. Long-serving workers are afraid they may be taken on by Alchemy and a year later be sacked and told they qualify for only one year's compensation. </p> <p>Kumar, 41, is one of many British Asians at Longbridge. After 14 years in the plant, he has imbibed local pride as much as anyone else. \"This is the birthplace of the Mini. The Rover marque is our heritage. This is what hurts people,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Only five weeks ago we were looking at an exhibition of new models and their future plans. They invited us to bring the wife and children to see it. Then they do this. The government should intervene. It's unacceptable, this mass redundancy. It's an utter mightmare. We all thought the plant was secure.\" </p> <p>Longbridge is a deceptive place. It was built as a greenfield site, but the suburbs of south Birmingham now lap close to its sprawling red-brick buildings. This is no dark satanic mill; it looks more like an affluent technical college with its hundreds of cars parked on every inch of pavement around the factory. Workers drive in from all over the West Midlands. </p> <p>Today thousands of them will take part in Britain's biggest industrial march for at least a decade. Backed by several local MPs and church leaders it will rumble through the streets of Birmingham, culminating in a rally in Cannon Hill Park, not far from the Edgbaston cricket ground. It is not only many of the 10,000 Rover workers and their families who will turn out, but hundreds of others in the supply chain. Up to 50,000 other jobs could go if Rover were to close completely. </p> <p>The unions expect workers from apparently successful car plants such as Jaguar and Peugeot to take part, since the Rover crisis has shown that under the pressures of globalisation car companies across the world are merging production and cutting staff. </p> <p>They are even hoping for support from the IG Metall trade union in Germany, as German workers realise that they are in an international struggle. Contrary to the stereotypes portrayed by newspapers such as the Sun, anti-German feeling at Longbridge is remarkably low. Workers blame BMW, not Germany as a whole, and take heart from the fact that influential news magazines such as Der Spiegel and much of the German press reporting of the crisis have focused on BMW's mismanagement and its loss of image. </p> <p><strong> Suspicious</strong><br> </p> <p> Mike, an assembly line worker, says: \"Saturday's march is not a rebellious thing. In the 1970s they would have walked out and put pickets round the factory. Here we're still building cars. Considering the severity of the circumstances, it's been very quiet, almost unnervingly so.\" </p> <p>Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham city council, who will be on today's march, complains: \"Longbridge has been cut off without having a chance to prove itself. The view round here is that the sales of the Rover 75 were artificially depressed when BMW announced on the launch day that Rover was facing losses. They almost set in train a strategy to undermine the 75.\" </p> <p>His opinion is widely shared. \"They decided to finish production of the Metro before starting to make its replacement, the new Mini. That left a gap in the market of up to three years. Why didn't they wait?\" says Tim Parker, regional organiser for the MSF union. \"At the time we put it down to incompetence. Now we're suspicious.\" </p> <p>He believes BMW's secret purpose in buying Rover six years ago was to give itself \"critical mass\" by getting a high-volume production line in addition to its own top-of-the range cars. \"It wanted to stop itself being eaten by a predator because the word was that in five years there would only be a few car companies left in the world: GM, Ford, one in the far east and one or two in Europe. They picked it up and ran off with it but now they've smashed it to the ground. It's an act of pure vandalism.\" </p> <p>For many workers it is the waste that seems so unfathomable. Sleek new models stand in the Longbridge yard, apparently facing being scrapped. Giant transporters, stacked high with precision-made vehicles, lumber through the gates and head for dealerships that have suddenly become ashamed of the brand. </p> <p>Colin and Mike, two 20-year-olds in the final months of a five-year apprenticeship at Rover, are bitter. It was partly the romanticism of the production process that attracted them. </p> <p>\"I found it amazing. You've got a bare shell at one end and a finished car at the other. I felt proud of it,\" says Colin. \"But on Friday it was like a morgue. Some halls have been closed. They were just empty. It was so quiet with no engines running, no music, no banter, no shouting.\" </p> <p>Now they are waiting as anxiously as everyone else. \"We want to stay and finish our qualifications in August, but we don't know if they'll sack us. We may be seen as long-term assets, or told to go because we lack experience,\" says Mike. </p> <p>Sympathetic and fast-talking, Ms Jowell sits in a small conference room in the management wing at Longbridge explaining the government's plans for early action to help people faced with redundancy. She is anxious to show that the government cares, after all the charges that it ignored the warning signs before BMW's announcement. No doubt she is also aware that 23 of the 27 Westminster seats within a 15-mile radius of Longbridge are held by Labour. </p> <p>A group of senior Rover staff have just told her they are as much out of the loop as the workers. Now it is the shop stewards' turn. Amazingly, Ms Jowell had not scheduled a meeting with the trade unions, but when a newspaper reporter queried the omission she hastily asked the works' convenors to come up. </p> <p>It soon becomes clear that the two sides have different priorities. The minister reports that the government has allocated \u00a310m to strengthen the employment service so that officials can devote more time to Rover workers facing redundancy. She mentions the advance party in the canteen downstairs, who can give advice on retraining, benefits, and cash-flow problems for people on mortgages. </p> <p>\"I'm going to be honest,\" says Alwyn Thomas of the engineering union, the AEEU, bluntly sidestepping the offer. \"The only way forward is to keep this plant open. We've got no alternative but to fight for this place. I've been here 37 years and it's never been so bad.\" He asks why the government does not consider helping a rival bid for Rover led by John Hemming, a local millionaire. </p> <p>\"These are commercial decisions. Our job is to see the infrastructure is there,\" Ms Jowell tells him before setting off to meet the taskforce set up by the Department of Trade and Industry. It will estimate job losses, produce plans for keeping skilled workers in the industry, and develop ideas for new uses for Longbridge site. </p> <p>Union officials say these measures are only useful as Plan B. Plan A must be to save Longbridge as a car factory. The government has offered \u00a3129m to cover some of the costs of the crisis. BMW is offering Alchemy 1bn marks (\u00a3330m) to take over the plant. Union officials wonder why this could not be added together to offer to an alternative bidder who could keep the plant open as a high-volume producer rather than the niche market Alchemy is planning. They claim most of Rover's deficit is due to German accounting rules that require new investments to be depreciated in the first five years rather than, as in Britain, spread out over a longer period. </p> <p>\"The government should do some strategic thinking,\" argues Tim Parker of the MSF. \"If it's going to cast \u00a3500m in jobseekers' allowances and other benefits, why not say we'll join you in helping save this company? Let's not talk about nationalisation - that's dead and buried -but what's wrong with private-public partnership?\" </p> <p>At the city council and the chamber of commerce, which have been working hard to develop the West Midlands' im age, the closure of Rover is seen as a fearful blow. The region had managed to climb out of the recession of the mid-1980s by lessening its dependence on car manufacture. It has built up a successful financial services sector thanks to the attraction of huge infrastructure projects, from the National Exhibition Centre on the edge of the city to the Convention Centre and National Indoor Arena down-town. \"In the first half of the 80s we lost more jobs than in the whole of Scotland and Wales,\" says Mr Bore. \"Losing Longbridge, if that is what happens, will be a shock to the West Midlands but we are in a better position to overcome it now.\" </p> <p>Even before the Rover crisis, employers were finding it hard to attract school-leavers into engineering. Studies have shown that parents' views are the main factor behind young people's career choices, and after the unemployment crisis of the 1980s engineering got a bad name. It had a poor image of dirty jobs, low pay, bad conditions and uncertainty. At university level an increasing number of students insured themselves by combining engineering courses with business studies or marketing. That trend is likely to accelerate. In all the gloom, one voice stands out for its defiance of the conventional wisdom. Geoff Edge was one of Labour's youngest MPs until he lost his seat in 1979. Now he heads West Midlands Enterprise, an investment consultancy. </p> <p>Although he criticises BMW's over-confidence in taking over a company it could not run and for its \"pathetic and dishonest exit\", he says the West Midlands' self-image is wrong. \"People don't seem to understand that while employment is falling in manufacturing, output is up. The notion that manufacturing is dead is nonsense,\" he says as he produces the latest forecasts from Cambridge Econometrics. </p> <p>They show that while jobs in the motor vehicles sector in the West Midlands declined from 110,000 in 1980 to 61,000 last year, gross value added nearly doubled in the same period (in inflation-adjusted terms) from \u00a31.4bn to \u00a32.7bn. By 2010 it was expected to go up to \u00a34.1bn. \"We have one of the strongest motor industries in Europe. It's all based on inward investment from abroad,\" he says. </p> <p>Mr Edge also debunks the new enthusiasm for the service sector, at least as a generator of stimulating jobs. Online shopping, telephone banking, and all the other forms of e-commerce are bound to grow but the work they involve is dull key-board tapping, which itself will increasingly be mechanised, he argues. </p> <p><strong> Flexible</strong><br> </p> <p> The labour-intensive sectors with interesting potential are education and health. Manufacturing will still offer jobs, but for a limited number of highly skilled, highly flexible people doing consumer-aided design and production engineering. \"World best practice in manufacturing is to use human beings as human beings, with small teams producing sophisticated components and intelligent people being used in an intelligent way,\" he says. </p> <p>His idealistic vision seems a far cry from BMW's failure to inform Rover's workers or management what was coming. A year ago the European commission drafted a directive that would require companies with at least 50 employees to inform and consult their staff on business and employment issues. </p> <p>It is hardly revolutionary stuff, with its get-out clauses on commercial confidentiality, its exclusion of public sector workers and its non-mention of trade unions. Employee representatives are described as \"social partners\". </p> <p>The British government has been one of the fiercest opponents of the directive. Ms Jowell was visibly shocked this week by the level of uncertainty crippling managers and workers at Longbridge as they ask each other \"Heard anything yet?\" So I asked her at the end of her trip if she now favoured the EU draft directive. </p> <p>\"Well, that's an issue that the DTI is leading with,\" she said. \"It's not really appropriate for me as employment minister to comment on that, beyond saying that of course consultation is important and all the evidence from successful British companies is that they realise the benefits of involving the workforce, consulting with the workforce, keeping the workforce well-informed and the demotivating impact of that not happening. What we don't want is to impose a regulatory burden on business that becomes a constraint on its competitiveness.\" </p> <p>Cold comfort there for Kumar, Adrian, and the apprentices who still hope for a future in industry. Since the regulations on prior consultation would apply to every business in Europe, how does that affect competition?</p>",

Ms Jowell was visibly shocked this week by the level of uncertainty crippling managers and workers at Longbridge as they ask each other \"Heard anything yet?\" So I asked her at the end of her trip if she now favoured the EU draft directive. \"Well, that's an issue that the DTI is leading with,\" she said. \"It's not really appropriate for me as employment minister to comment on that, beyond saying that of course consultation is important and all the evidence from successful British companies is that they realise the benefits of involving the workforce, consulting with the workforce, keeping the workforce well-informed and the demotivating impact of that not happening. What we don't want is to impose a regulatory burden on business that becomes a constraint on its competitiveness.\" Cold comfort there for Kumar, Adrian, and the apprentices who still hope for a future in industry. Since the regulations on prior consultation would apply to every business in Europe, how does that affect competition?",

Parliamentary elections are expected in May or June and there is increasing speculation that the opposition Movement for Democratic Change - a black front for white interests, according to Mr Mugabe - can get close to victory. Though the president is in office until 2002, his position could become untenable.</p> <p>This rally was in Matabeleland, a place harbouring long-standing bitterness towards the regime. The president's speech had to be translated from English into Ndebele.</p> <p>Many of the Mugabe allegations and threats will be familiar to Mr Blair but the sustained nature of the assault, and the setting, came as a shock. Officially, the occasion was to open a new and uncontroversial resettlement scheme at Dromoland Farm, a 60,000-acre ranch formerly owned by Lonrho and now to be shared by 200 families, it was said.</p> <p>The handful of white farmers at the rally were relieved that the attack on Labour - not a party to which they owe much allegiance - took the heat off them. But despite all the rhetoric, the atmosphere was entirely amiable.</p> <p>It was also engagingly shambolic. President Mugabe, now 76, slumped lower and lower in his chair through three hours of tribal dancing and warm up speeches. As his vice-president finally wound up, the rain started pelting down with rumbles of thunder and the crowd rushed for cover. There was a delay before the president began his speech.</p> <p>As the rain eased off, the speech soon became too powerful to ignore, but it will be scrutinised more carefully in London than in Dromoland. \"It's just electioneering,\" shrugged one of the whites.</p>",

Parliamentary elections are expected in May or June and there is increasing speculation that the opposition Movement for Democratic Change - a black front for white interests, according to Mr Mugabe - can get close to victory. Though the president is in office until 2002, his position could become untenable. This rally was in Matabeleland, a place harbouring long-standing bitterness towards the regime. The president's speech had to be translated from English into Ndebele. Many of the Mugabe allegations and threats will be familiar to Mr Blair but the sustained nature of the assault, and the setting, came as a shock. Officially, the occasion was to open a new and uncontroversial resettlement scheme at Dromoland Farm, a 60,000-acre ranch formerly owned by Lonrho and now to be shared by 200 families, it was said. The handful of white farmers at the rally were relieved that the attack on Labour - not a party to which they owe much allegiance - took the heat off them. But despite all the rhetoric, the atmosphere was entirely amiable. It was also engagingly shambolic. President Mugabe, now 76, slumped lower and lower in his chair through three hours of tribal dancing and warm up speeches. As his vice-president finally wound up, the rain started pelting down with rumbles of thunder and the crowd rushed for cover. There was a delay before the president began his speech. As the rain eased off, the speech soon became too powerful to ignore, but it will be scrutinised more carefully in London than in Dromoland. \"It's just electioneering,\" shrugged one of the whites.",

      "bodyText": "President-elect Vladimir Putin called yesterday for cuts in strategic nuclear arsenals and urged the Russian parliament to ratify a stalled arms control treaty which would halve US and Russian nuclear missiles. Sending a strong signal of rapprochement to the Americans and the west in general after a year of frosty relations, Mr Putin used his first speech since being elected last weekend to announce that his administration would focus on market reforms, that Russian strength did not mean repression, and that he wanted bigger and deeper arms cuts to make the world a safer place. But he also signalled a tough approach to international trade and issued a calculated snub to the Americans by suggesting that he would act in Russia's commercial interest by pursuing nuclear cooperation with Iran. Mr Putin went to Snezhinsk, the home of the Russian nuclear arms industry 900 miles east of Moscow, to deliver his first message of intent and to shed some light on his policy plans. \"Russia is conducting and will continue to conduct talks on reducing strategic offensive weapons further,\" he said. \"We are tackling the task of freeing the world from excessive weapons stockpiles. Our aim is to make our nuclear weapons complex safer and more effective. We will preserve and strengthen the Russian nuclear weapons complex, even though there is no question of building it up.\" He called on the Duma, the Russian lower house, to quickly ratify the stalled 1993 Start-II treaty, which aims to halve Russian and US nuclear warheads to around 3,500. He said his foreign and defence ministers had been told to lobby the MPs for quick ratification. The previous Duma, dominated by communists and nationalists, refused to accept the arms deal, which was ratified by the US Senate in 1996. Russian ratification of Start-II is a key foreign policy aim of President Bill Clinton in his last year in the White House, and Mr Putin drove home his pro-American message by sending a birthday greeting to the vice-president, Al Gore, stressing that he wanted to \"further the development of Russian-American relations\". In his first hints about his government team, Mr Putin said the new government, to be unveiled in May, would be made up of professionals committed to the free market. On Thursday he appointed a working group of four key officials to draft his first budget and prepare his economic policy blueprint. Three of the officials, all reform-minded economists, are seen as the nucleus of the new cabinet, while the fourth, Alexander Voloshin, is the powerful Kremlin chief of staff. \"Strengthening the state and continuing market reforms are the principles on which the work of the government will be based,\" Mr Putin said. Restoring Russian greatness and building a strong state are his main slogans, causing apprehension that the former KGB career officer may ride roughshod over democracy in his determined pursuit of greatness. Mr Putin denied that strengthening the Russian state would entail an increased resort to force and strengthening the armed forces and special services. A strong state, he said, meant enforcing the rule of law, anti-corruption measures and state guarantees of property rights. But while the policy directions outlined yesterday are likely to enamour Mr Putin further to western governments, there was also a sting in his remarks about exporting Russian nuclear technology. With comments liable to alarm Washington, he promised a robust defence of Russian interests in world markets. In the city that produces and assembles 60% of Russian nuclear warheads, and was closed to outsiders during the Soviet era, he was asked about nuclear power contracts with Iran. He made it plain that he wanted to market Russian nuclear expertise internationally. \"We will definitely fight for Russia's interests in world markets and won't allow anyone to exploit phony values to drive Russia from international markets,\" he said. Russia is already helping Iran to build a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, and the atomic energy minister, Yevgeny Adamov, said Iran was ready to order a further three reactors from Russia, while contracts were to be signed with India later this year for five Russian reactors.",

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 1937, the world's radio stations fell silent for two minutes. It was a mark of respect for Guglielmo Marconi, the man who laid the foundations for the broadcasting industry. </p> <p>Marconi died in the early hours of July 20, 1937 and is buried in the grounds of his family home, Villa Griffone, at Pontecchio, Bologna. The villa had been the site of his early experiments which overturned the accepted scientific wisdom that radio waves travelled in straight lines. He showed they were not affected by physical obstacles. </p> <p>But when the 21-year-old tried to get Italy's post and telecommunications ministry interested in using his idea to send messages he was rebuffed. </p> <p>His mother, a well-off member of the Jameson Irish whiskey family who had eloped with Marconi's father, had other ideas. She took him to England, where overzealous customs officers damaged his equipment, thinking the luggage contained a bomb. He used family connections to secure a meeting with William Preece, chief engineer of the Post Office, who gave his support to the young investor. </p> <p>Marconi patented his system of using radio waves for telegraphy. In 1897 he formed the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, although a demonstration on Salisbury Plain that year managed to send a signal just seven miles. </p> <p>He set up the world's first wireless factory in a disused silk factory in Chelmsford and the equipment quickly made its name after a series of dramatic sea rescues. </p> <p>In 1899, the Goodwin light ship off the Kent coast successfully radioed for a lifeboat after it was hit by a steamship in thick fog. In 1909, more than 1,700 people were rescued after two ships, the Republic and the Florida, collided in fog off the US east coast. The Marconi radio operator aboard the Florida sent out 200 messages over two days to guide rescue ships. </p> <p>Three years later, distress signals from the stricken Titanic were picked by by a German ship which helped to save 705 lives. Marconi had arrived in New York two days earlier.

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 1937, the world's radio stations fell silent for two minutes. It was a mark of respect for Guglielmo Marconi, the man who laid the foundations for the broadcasting industry. Marconi died in the early hours of July 20, 1937 and is buried in the grounds of his family home, Villa Griffone, at Pontecchio, Bologna. The villa had been the site of his early experiments which overturned the accepted scientific wisdom that radio waves travelled in straight lines. He showed they were not affected by physical obstacles. But when the 21-year-old tried to get Italy's post and telecommunications ministry interested in using his idea to send messages he was rebuffed. His mother, a well-off member of the Jameson Irish whiskey family who had eloped with Marconi's father, had other ideas. She took him to England, where overzealous customs officers damaged his equipment, thinking the luggage contained a bomb. He used family connections to secure a meeting with William Preece, chief engineer of the Post Office, who gave his support to the young investor. Marconi patented his system of using radio waves for telegraphy. In 1897 he formed the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, although a demonstration on Salisbury Plain that year managed to send a signal just seven miles. He set up the world's first wireless factory in a disused silk factory in Chelmsford and the equipment quickly made its name after a series of dramatic sea rescues. In 1899, the Goodwin light ship off the Kent coast successfully radioed for a lifeboat after it was hit by a steamship in thick fog. In 1909, more than 1,700 people were rescued after two ships, the Republic and the Florida, collided in fog off the US east coast. The Marconi radio operator aboard the Florida sent out 200 messages over two days to guide rescue ships. Three years later, distress signals from the stricken Titanic were picked by by a German ship which helped to save 705 lives. Marconi had arrived in New York two days earlier. The survivors presented him with a solid gold medal. By this time Marconi had proved that wireless signals could travel across the Atlantic. In 1910, the infamous Dr Crippen and his mistress were arrested following a ship-to-shore radio message sent on Marconi equipment. The entertainment value of radio was demonstrated in 1920 when a song recital by Dame Nellie Melba was broadcast from Marconi's Chelms ford works. Two years later, Marconi was in at the founding of the BBC. His company set up the first microwave telephone link between the Vatican City and the Pope's summer retreat, Castel Gandolfo. In 1937 it began building Britain's first air defence radar network. Marconi's portrait appeared on everything from meat extract to bank notes. In the consumer world, the Marconi name was linked to radio sets and valves. After the second world war, his compa nies were swallowed up first by English Electric and eventually by General Electric Company which used the Marconi name for its electronic defence business. When GEC sold the defence business to BAe for \u00a31bn last year, to concentrate on communications and IT, it retained the name Marconi as the group's title. This week the company invested \u00a340m in a new communications research centre at Cambridge University. Guglielmo Marconi never qualified to go to university.",

      "bodyText": "The wife of the deposed Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, yesterday threatened to defy the military regime and bring protesters out on to the streets if her husband is convicted in his hijacking trial next week. Kulsoom Sharif already faces a charge of treason after making an angry speech to hundreds of workers from her husband's Pakistan Muslim League last month. \"If the decision is not positive then we will go and demonstrate,\" Mrs Sharif, 45, said from her family's sprawling Raiwind estate, on the outskirts of Lahore. Next Thursday an anti-terrorism court judge in Karachi will deliver his verdict on Mr Sharif and may sentence him to death. The former prime minister, his brother Shahbaz and five former senior government officials are charged with hijacking, attempted murder, kidnapping and terrorism. They have all pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say that on October 12 Mr Sharif sacked his army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, and then tried to stop a commercial aircraft carrying the general landing in Pakistan, risking the lives of the 198 people on board. The general landed after the army took control of Karachi airport and within hours he staged a coup. Last month Gen Musharraf announced a ban on political rallies. \"Let them ban all these things,\" said Mrs Sharif, who sat dressed in a flowing pink shalwar kameez trouser suit and clutching a mobile telephone. She has spent the past five months travelling from the green lawns and golden wheat fields of Raiwind, in her husband's political heartland, across the country in a desperate attempt to raise support for his cause. \"They have banned them but the rallies are still there in Faisalabad, in Multan, in Hyderabad. We have demonstrated and they cannot do anything,\" she said. \"Every Pakistani is with me and everybody in the army is with me, except the generals.\" But few Pakistanis took to the streets to resist army rule in the days immediately after the coup, nor have they marched in the five months since. Their reluctance is a sign of the resentment that many felt towards Mr Sharif, one of the country's wealthiest businessmen whose family stands accused of widespread corruption. Senior leaders in Mr Sharif's party have also been slow to lead protests, perhaps worried about their careers. \"They are not complaining,\" Mrs Sharif said. \"Sometimes it does disappoint me.\" Already lawyers are preparing to appeal against a guilty verdict. \"They have not found a single piece of evidence that he was guilty of hijacking. It was all a pre-planned story,\" she said. \"[Musharraf] is a vindictive general.\" Diplomats say Mr Sharif can expect a guilty verdict, although even if the court sentences him to death, the military will probably commute the sentence on appeal; Pakistan's sickly economy still needs loans and the new regime is unlikely to risk scaring international lenders. Yet in the background of Pakistan's brief and troubled political history remains the disturbing precedent of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prime minister hanged on April 4 1979, after he was overthrown by another general, Zia ul-Haq. Reports have suggested that the Sharif family has reached an out-of-court agreement to pay the regime in order to avoid the death penalty or a lengthy jail sentence. But Mrs Sharif denied these and ruled out the possibility of going into exile. \"There is no agreement. Nobody came to him, nobody came to me,\" she said. \"This is our country. Where can we go?\" With Mr Sharif in jail there are no heavyweight political figures left in Pakistan to challenge the military. His arch-rival, Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister, is in London and faces a five-year jail term and a heavy fine for corruption if she returns to Pakistan. Even after the hijacking trial, the Sharif family will find itself under pressure from a string of corruption investigations into huge sugar, steel, textile and paper interests. Two cases against the family have already been registered and another 16 will follow, in vestigators say. Mrs Sharif insists that the Raiwind estate and four Park Lane apartments are the fruit of business profits, not political kickbacks. \"Having property is not illegal,\" she said. \"The Sharif family is not at all corrupt and, insh'allah [God willing], we will prove it one day.\"",

And because I feel so strongly about it, because I want it to be every brilliant thing it can be, I feel violent when it doesn't live up to its vast potential. For instance, the words \"spasm,\" \"crust\" and \"gusset\" make me feel ill; if anyone asked me after sex whether I had had a \"climax\", I would be tempted to gouge out their eyes; and if someone wants me to bang their head against a wall, they need only say \"Enjoy!\" before giving me a plate of food. </p> <p>Another word that people say at their own risk in front of me is \"pamper\". According to the dictionary, to pamper is \"to indulge too much, to feed to the full\". Really? That's not what it means now.

Hey, the poor guy's already had to reconcile himself to the fact that he's not having regular penetrative sex with Angelina Jolie; the least you can do is get your cuticles knocked into decent shape! </p> <p>The sad transformation of the word \"pamper\" goes to show how much pleasure, especially for women, has been pathologised in recent years. Pampering would once have indicated a lost weekend of champagne, lobster and sodomy; it now means, when used in the context of women, \"having a wash\" or, perhaps, \"keeping the equipment in order\". It has become, in short, a Buswoman's Holiday. The consolation is that, as with most dubious words, it says a lot more about those who use it (just as people who use \"Enjoy!\" before eating are generally neurotic, wound-tight potential bulimics who couldn't enjoy food with a clear conscience if it jumped off the plate yelling \"Eat me quick!\") than that which it purports to describe. If anyone uses the p-word, without irony, to describe the process of getting clean, they identify themselves as being a non-orgasmic, puritanical little mule who wouldn't recognise real pleasure if it love-bit them. </p> <p>For, surely, \"pampering\" is a sad, shop-bought imitation of the way good sex is supposed to make you feel: relaxed, treasured, confident. You have to hand it to the ingenuity of the marketplace - it knows it can sell sex to men purely as sex, but to women, being the delicate flowers they are, it has to sell it as being clean. In my bleak, dystopian moments, I imagine the twentysomethings of 2020, the men all shut up in their bedrooms downloading hardcore porn and the women taking long baths in ready-mixed aromatherapy oils called Sensual and Erotic. For many women, titivating themselves has become not a prelude to sex but an end in itself. After all, the last thing you want when you've spent hours honing yourself to perfection is some smelly man putting his greasy mitts on the goods. The New Narcissists may kid themselves that they're ultra-femme females but, as surely as any cloistered nun, they are dedicated to something far beyond romantic love. Female narcissism is the feminism of the stupid - and it would be better for everyone if it was the only kind of self-regard we were interested in, apparently. Earlier this month, one half of the Daily Mail's front page screamed Pamper Yourself, offering \u00a330 of moisturiser, aromatherapy oils, bath foam and scented candles to readers (\"The perfect antidote to today's stressful lifestyle\"), while the other laboured under the headline Anger Over Astonishing New Right To Abortion. Obviously no one at the paper saw the funny side of this - a stressful lifestyle will obviously not be much improved by the addition of an unwanted child. And you try spending a bit of decent me-time in the tub with a brat screaming next door. </p> <p>At the risk of cruising for a Pseud's Corner bruising, I'd say that the scented \"aromatherapy\" candle is one of the foremost weapons in middlebrow England's dirty little war against feminism - its message being, \"Calm down, you hysterical cow, and stop complaining. You stink! And you're so ugly, don't let any man see you with the light on, he'll run a mile!\" Scented candles make Blanche DuBoises of us all: never quite smelling, looking or \"being\" good enough to be looked upon without the intervention of all kinds of merciful middle men. And the fashion and beauty industries being what they are, nine times out of 10 those middle-men are gay; and while gay men have many excellent qualities, their appreciation of the sight, smell and taste of the unadorned female body is not one of them. </p> <p> As women have, on average, 15 hours a week less than men to devote to leisure, it's rather sad that the little spare time they do have is consumed by the business of maintaining their market value. Every girl grows up with the mindless mantra \"cleanse, tone, moisturise\", but these days this is only the beginning of any decent skin \"regime\". The word invariably used to make vacuous primping seem like an outward bound course; now you need to masque, exfoliate, polish, too. Twenty years ago, a jar of Nivea Cream would cover a multitude of skins, but now there are distinct lotions and potions for every single bit of the body - eyes, thighs, insteps. I'm sure that somewhere in a laboratory in Switzerland a clever scientist is this very moment dreaming up a cream to be used on some newly- discovered essential zone; the two big toes, perhaps, or the inside of the elbow. And this time next year, we'll wonder how we ever lived without it. </p> <p>Even weirder is the growing popularity of the spa holiday, where the usual two weeks of sea, sun and sangria are sacrificed in favour of seaweed wraps and protein shakes. On a recent holiday to an all- inclusive resort in Jamaica, the hotel presented me with a coupon to have whatever I wanted done at its state-of-the-art spa. From speaking to the other broads, I understood that they were queuing up to have mud slapped all over them.

Why should a few Romanian women in brightly coloured shawls, begging with their babies, have suddenly provoked a national phobia? It is important to recognise that Gypsies have always provided the most difficult test of tolerance of human rights; and that they are a forewarning of the problems Britain will inevitably face in an enlarged European Union. They have to be faced before they provide a rallying-point for the forces of intolerance.</p> <p>Journalists and politicians have made racial attacks on Gypsies which they would not dare to make against other peoples. \"All the racism that the national press feels too ashamed to express against black people,\" said the black newspaper, the Voice, \"it felt free to aim at the Gypsies\". But in central and eastern Europe, they provoke much fiercer reactions. When I talked to the distinguished Czech scientist-poet Miroslav Holub before he died last year, our conversation came to a painful end when I asked about Czech Gypsies: \"There are some rights,\" he said frostily, \"which a young democracy cannot concede.\"</p> <p>There has always been a difficult duality in European attitudes to Gypsies, as I learned through my grand- father John Sampson, who compiled the first Romani dictionary. He acquired a passion for their culture which left him with many Gypsy friends; but the romantic interest of intellectuals in Gypsies was very detached from the fears and resentments of ordinary people, which are now again being exploited.</p> <p>It is crucial to understand the historical background. Gypsies have always provoked strong reactions, ever since they first migrated to Europe from India in the late middle ages, bringing their nomadic habits, their proud and separate communities and their tradition of begging. At first they were protected by Catholic rulers, and seen as penitents entitled to alms and succour. But the Reformation produced a more intolerant attitude to outsiders who would not accept protestant disciplines; and for centuries they suffered persecution as vagrants and petty thieves.</p> <p>The industrial revolution and the motor car provided a still greater threat to their lifestyles, depriving them of livelihoods based on horses, and extending the cities and suburbs which encroached on the open countryside, their favoured habitat.</p> <p>There were always two sides to the Europeans' attitude. Many romantic artists and intellectuals were enchanted by their wild songs, exotic clothes, their closeness to nature and their unique language, developed from Sanskrit. But government bureaucrats were determined to educate them, tame them and fence them in, and the romantic interest was not much help.</p> <p>Each new government had its own reasons to hate them. The Nazis saw them, like the Jews, as a threat to racial purity: they murdered about half a million Gypsies - who remain shamefully neglected in memorials to the Holocaust. The post-war communist regimes saw them as a threat to their elaborate state planning and controls: while they did not massacre them, they hemmed them into minimal housing and restricted their movements.</p> <p>But many post-communist governments in eastern Europe have in some ways treated them worse, seeing them as a threat to law and order and economic prospects in a capitalist world. In Romania, as Britain's Refugee Council reported last year, \"the post- Ceausescu period has been marked by horrific mob violence against Roma, with hundreds of deaths\".</p> <p>The Gypsies provided a fundamental challenge to the principles and idealism of a united Europe. Gypsies were true Europeans, in terms of their mobility and ignoring of national frontiers; and their alternative lifestyle, defying the constraints of cities and capitalism, provided a test of individual freedom and human rights. The European Union cannot now ignore the test, at a time when the countries with the biggest Gypsy populations are clamouring to join it.</p> <p>The most prosperous and western countries are not necessarily the most tolerant, and the Balkans are not always the worst. When I visited Serbia five years ago, I talked to the leader of the Gypsies in Belgrade who reckoned that the most intolerant were the Czechs - who are now closest to joining the European Union. But the 4m Gypsies in eastern Europe present a much bigger long-term problem, of which Britain is now having its first taste. The first British response to the small inflow of Gypsies across the Channel has been essentially nationalist; but we cannot make sense of the problem except in the context of Europe.</p> <p>If the \"second tier\" of eastern Europeans, including Romania (with 2m Gypsies) and Hungary (with 600,000) - are eventually to become members of the European Union, the British and the other richer western countries cannot realistically be expected to provide open frontiers for refugees from countries which maltreat them. But they have an obligation to insist on their freedom from persecution within an enlarged Europe.</p> <p>The European Union will have to link more firmly the applications to join the union with the acceptance of human rights, for which their treatment of Gypsies would act as a yardstick. The Council of Europe in Strasbourg, which embraces eastern Europeans, has shown much greater interest in Gypsies than the Brussels bureaucrats; but Strasbourg will have to play a more positive role in monitoring and publicising their persecutions.</p> <p>The Gypsies are certainly awkward victims - as if they were determined to test tolerance to its limits. Their tradition of begging with their children and assuming an obligation to charity is now out of keeping with the western spirit of self-reliance and commercial competition. Their attitudes to the law and the police are more defiant and less obedient than those of the bourgeois citizens of the west; while their nomadic habits cut across all the neat assumptions of national and local planning.</p> <p>But their contrariness still has some resonance among the more adventurous young British, beyond mere romanticism and sentimentality, as shown by the travellers and caravan dwellers who cannot stand circumscribed city life. And any political system which provides no escape-valve from the pressures of conformity carries the danger of eventual explosion.</p> <p>\u0095 Anthony Sampson is the author of The Scholar Gypsy, published by John Murray.</p>",

Journalists and politicians have made racial attacks on Gypsies which they would not dare to make against other peoples. \"All the racism that the national press feels too ashamed to express against black people,\" said the black newspaper, the Voice, \"it felt free to aim at the Gypsies\". But in central and eastern Europe, they provoke much fiercer reactions. When I talked to the distinguished Czech scientist-poet Miroslav Holub before he died last year, our conversation came to a painful end when I asked about Czech Gypsies: \"There are some rights,\" he said frostily, \"which a young democracy cannot concede.\" There has always been a difficult duality in European attitudes to Gypsies, as I learned through my grand- father John Sampson, who compiled the first Romani dictionary. He acquired a passion for their culture which left him with many Gypsy friends; but the romantic interest of intellectuals in Gypsies was very detached from the fears and resentments of ordinary people, which are now again being exploited. It is crucial to understand the historical background. Gypsies have always provoked strong reactions, ever since they first migrated to Europe from India in the late middle ages, bringing their nomadic habits, their proud and separate communities and their tradition of begging. At first they were protected by Catholic rulers, and seen as penitents entitled to alms and succour. But the Reformation produced a more intolerant attitude to outsiders who would not accept protestant disciplines; and for centuries they suffered persecution as vagrants and petty thieves. The industrial revolution and the motor car provided a still greater threat to their lifestyles, depriving them of livelihoods based on horses, and extending the cities and suburbs which encroached on the open countryside, their favoured habitat. There were always two sides to the Europeans' attitude. Many romantic artists and intellectuals were enchanted by their wild songs, exotic clothes, their closeness to nature and their unique language, developed from Sanskrit. But government bureaucrats were determined to educate them, tame them and fence them in, and the romantic interest was not much help. Each new government had its own reasons to hate them. The Nazis saw them, like the Jews, as a threat to racial purity: they murdered about half a million Gypsies - who remain shamefully neglected in memorials to the Holocaust. The post-war communist regimes saw them as a threat to their elaborate state planning and controls: while they did not massacre them, they hemmed them into minimal housing and restricted their movements. But many post-communist governments in eastern Europe have in some ways treated them worse, seeing them as a threat to law and order and economic prospects in a capitalist world. In Romania, as Britain's Refugee Council reported last year, \"the post- Ceausescu period has been marked by horrific mob violence against Roma, with hundreds of deaths\". The Gypsies provided a fundamental challenge to the principles and idealism of a united Europe. Gypsies were true Europeans, in terms of their mobility and ignoring of national frontiers; and their alternative lifestyle, defying the constraints of cities and capitalism, provided a test of individual freedom and human rights. The European Union cannot now ignore the test, at a time when the countries with the biggest Gypsy populations are clamouring to join it. The most prosperous and western countries are not necessarily the most tolerant, and the Balkans are not always the worst. When I visited Serbia five years ago, I talked to the leader of the Gypsies in Belgrade who reckoned that the most intolerant were the Czechs - who are now closest to joining the European Union. But the 4m Gypsies in eastern Europe present a much bigger long-term problem, of which Britain is now having its first taste. The first British response to the small inflow of Gypsies across the Channel has been essentially nationalist; but we cannot make sense of the problem except in the context of Europe. If the \"second tier\" of eastern Europeans, including Romania (with 2m Gypsies) and Hungary (with 600,000) - are eventually to become members of the European Union, the British and the other richer western countries cannot realistically be expected to provide open frontiers for refugees from countries which maltreat them. But they have an obligation to insist on their freedom from persecution within an enlarged Europe. The European Union will have to link more firmly the applications to join the union with the acceptance of human rights, for which their treatment of Gypsies would act as a yardstick. The Council of Europe in Strasbourg, which embraces eastern Europeans, has shown much greater interest in Gypsies than the Brussels bureaucrats; but Strasbourg will have to play a more positive role in monitoring and publicising their persecutions. The Gypsies are certainly awkward victims - as if they were determined to test tolerance to its limits. Their tradition of begging with their children and assuming an obligation to charity is now out of keeping with the western spirit of self-reliance and commercial competition. Their attitudes to the law and the police are more defiant and less obedient than those of the bourgeois citizens of the west; while their nomadic habits cut across all the neat assumptions of national and local planning. But their contrariness still has some resonance among the more adventurous young British, beyond mere romanticism and sentimentality, as shown by the travellers and caravan dwellers who cannot stand circumscribed city life. And any political system which provides no escape-valve from the pressures of conformity carries the danger of eventual explosion. \u0095 Anthony Sampson is the author of The Scholar Gypsy, published by John Murray.",

      "body": "<p>During the last week of my month in New York, I have been up to Columbia University to take part in a students' writing class. I was invited there by a friend, Tom Beller, a high-flying writer in the magazine world, who is conducting an evening course on writing and journalism. I arrived in the middle of a discussion of \"personal\" journalism. There wasn't much of a contribution for me to make, since I hadn't read the two pieces that were being talked about - one was about a girl's loss of her virginity, the other was by another girl about her fraught relationship with her father. About 10 young people were seated around a long table engaging in what is called \"upspeak\", the practice of speaking every sentence as if it were a question. \"I quite enjoyed it, right? But it was like, okay, that the writer was holding stuff back? I was feeling like, right, she wasn't being completely honest?\" Upspeak is widespread among American college students, especially among women, and seems to reflect insecurity and a craving for reassurance. </p> <p>According to Tom, most of his students were pretty bright, and some of them wrote well. But he said that the course had been a draining experience because of a fierce undercurrent of emotion beneath the surface of the debate. I saw no sign of this until about halfway through the class, when the true agenda of a couple of the students was exposed - they were there not so much to talk about writing for its own sake as to seek advice on how to break into the world of magazine journalism and get pieces published. My own advice was to steer clear initially of \"personal\" journalism, unless they had some truly unusual and interesting personal experience to report. </p> <p>One of the students said that there had recently been a very good article in the New York Times Magazine by someone who had drawn a gun on a policeman. This was clearly a good example of what I meant, but not a practice to be encouraged in Mayor Giuliani's New York. As recent events have shown, you don't even have to possess a gun, let alone draw one, to get shot dead by a policeman. At the funeral in Brooklyn last Saturday of one such victim, a ceremony marred by clashes with the police, the presiding reverend called on God for protection from the New York Police Department. \"We are defenceless, we are without weapons,\" he said. \"Instead of protecting us, they [the police] are assassinating us. Keep your eyes on us, Lord. Protect us. We ask for justice.\" </p> <p>Anyway, it quickly became clear that some of the students believed that all advice was worthless, even though they were claiming to want it. They felt themselves up against an invisible wall that would stop them ever getting anything published, however good it was. They were convinced that, without friends or connections in the journalistic world, nobody could ever break in to it. Tom then pointed out that to say there was nepotism at work was as obvious as stating that the sky was blue, but he insisted that any writer with ability and persistence would get published in the end. However, a couple of his students just could not accept this. They appeared to be attending his classes purely to demonstrate their futility. They wanted to convince him that he was wasting his time, because nothing he said could possibly help them. </p> <p> Their attitude starkly illustrated the sense of exclusion felt by many people in New York, especially among black residents. It is a depressing phenomenon, widely blamed on Mayor Giuliani for his unquestioning support of the New York police, who have killed three unarmed black men in little more than a year. But even if Giuliani is a bit of a monster and a divisive influence on the city, young people must somehow be prevented from wallowing in their victimhood. It is unhealthy and destructive. I tried to persuade the unpersuadable ones that, although things are much harder for some than for others, talent is almost always recognised in the end, that there are always editors with open minds, and that the way to get published was to write, not to talk. </p> <p>I can't remember which editor it was who said that the most important quality in any article was \"doneness\", but I repeated this to them. Tom was even brave enough to say that there were other ways of getting on in the world than writing articles for magazines; and that for people with genuine writing talent, the key to success was writing about things that really interested them, instead of arguing theoretically about what might or might not interest an editor. As we left, he said that I should have attended the start of his course, when I would have found the surliness much greater. He believed he was making good progress.</p>",

If you are ever passing Downing Street of a morning, wait a while and you will see those simpering hacks being ushered past the hopeful petitioners and bemused back-packers pressed up against the huge, black iron gates. It would never occur to the prime minister's briefees that the welcome extended to them makes them more or less redundant as anything other than digitised town criers.</p> <p>Anyway, bitter rambling aside, my point is that, with varying amounts of scepticism about the alternative, we, the public, joyously threw the Tories from our backs. We did it. Lots of us. In fact, Blair was clearly baffled and disturbed that we did so in such numbers</p> <p>Now, it is widely accepted by all but his tiny inner circle that there is very great disappointment with Blair. Mainstream comment agrees that he should listen to Peter Kilfoyle and other \"loyalists\". That is foolish advice; it can only have been by listening to such unstintingly craven hatchet-men that Blair became such a vain and demented controller in the first place. It is a bit late for pleas from the heartlands.</p> <p>With all the weaknesses and contradictions of a social democratic party, Labour was one. It is now something else. I'm not even sure what. All I know is we must stay awake because they get you when you sleep. I'm convinced that lorry loads of strange-looking pods are dispatched from Millbank to local authorities every night. I give Ken Livingstone six months before he tells us, with glazed serenity: \"Nothing's wrong. I feel fine now.\"</p> <p>And yet somehow the human spirit is surviving. Because Livingstone is seen as his own man - not because he has adopted the Liberal ruse of raising finance for the tube by selling raffle tickets - he will deliver a humiliating blow to the Blair project. Other local election results will further embarrass the leader. How can the people who won that spectacular victory three years ago be so stupid now? Possi bly because they didn't win it - it was handed to them on a plate. Most of us who are handed plates have the good grace to acknowledge that whatever is on it was made by someone else. We say: \"Ooh, thanks, that looks moist.\" Blair would say: \"Look, as long as I'm holding this, never again will I let it return to the bad old days of sogginess at the one extreme and dryness on the other.\"</p> <p>The Blairites just don't get it. We often hear that the left and the anti-nuclear movement were out of touch with popular opinion in the 80s, even though about half the population was against Cruise and Trident. But this government is incapable of grasping the public mood about anything. It tries to reassure us about British Nuclear Fuels by giving BNFL Aldermaston to play with, as though our concern was not that BNFL is a dangerous incompetent but that it doesn't have deterrent capability.</p> <p>And when well-meaning worthies produce a mild report saying that lying to young people about drugs might undermine the government's credibility, the reaction is: \"Don't listen kids! One puff on a pot-hash butt and you'll be hooked on loco weed!\" The police are saying: \"Look, Mr Straw, we love nicking people, but even we get bored with dope-smokers and refugees.\" But Straw will not rest until half the country is in detention. And his response to calls for open government is: \"Trust me - you don't want to know.\"</p> <p>The government tries to appeal to us in consumer language -\"cutting out the middle man\". That would be elected councillors, juries, trade unions, all those people with a duty to uphold our rights, getting in the way when all we want is to be ruled, sentenced and managed. In fact, wouldn't it be better if pay bargaining was replaced with decisions taken by local magistrates?</p> <p>Having its finger firmly on the pulse, the government realises people would like improvement in local services and so proposes \"cabinet style\" (closed) local government. Then perhaps Whitehall won't have to bypass councils because it will have recreated them in its own image. Then councils could have upper chambers with locally ennobled Blairite members, an appointed gentry. I'm brainstorming here, but the appointees could be local media types, magistrates, business-people and those mysterious, rootless people who become school governors, but don't appear to have any connection with schools. Just a suggestion.</p> <p>The trouble is Labour will probably have lost a load of councils by the time the Local Government Act is implemented. That must not have occurred to Labour.</p>",

If you are ever passing Downing Street of a morning, wait a while and you will see those simpering hacks being ushered past the hopeful petitioners and bemused back-packers pressed up against the huge, black iron gates. It would never occur to the prime minister's briefees that the welcome extended to them makes them more or less redundant as anything other than digitised town criers. Anyway, bitter rambling aside, my point is that, with varying amounts of scepticism about the alternative, we, the public, joyously threw the Tories from our backs. We did it. Lots of us. In fact, Blair was clearly baffled and disturbed that we did so in such numbers Now, it is widely accepted by all but his tiny inner circle that there is very great disappointment with Blair. Mainstream comment agrees that he should listen to Peter Kilfoyle and other \"loyalists\". That is foolish advice; it can only have been by listening to such unstintingly craven hatchet-men that Blair became such a vain and demented controller in the first place. It is a bit late for pleas from the heartlands. With all the weaknesses and contradictions of a social democratic party, Labour was one. It is now something else. I'm not even sure what. All I know is we must stay awake because they get you when you sleep. I'm convinced that lorry loads of strange-looking pods are dispatched from Millbank to local authorities every night. I give Ken Livingstone six months before he tells us, with glazed serenity: \"Nothing's wrong. I feel fine now.\" And yet somehow the human spirit is surviving. Because Livingstone is seen as his own man - not because he has adopted the Liberal ruse of raising finance for the tube by selling raffle tickets - he will deliver a humiliating blow to the Blair project. Other local election results will further embarrass the leader. How can the people who won that spectacular victory three years ago be so stupid now? Possi bly because they didn't win it - it was handed to them on a plate. Most of us who are handed plates have the good grace to acknowledge that whatever is on it was made by someone else. We say: \"Ooh, thanks, that looks moist.\" Blair would say: \"Look, as long as I'm holding this, never again will I let it return to the bad old days of sogginess at the one extreme and dryness on the other.\" The Blairites just don't get it. We often hear that the left and the anti-nuclear movement were out of touch with popular opinion in the 80s, even though about half the population was against Cruise and Trident. But this government is incapable of grasping the public mood about anything. It tries to reassure us about British Nuclear Fuels by giving BNFL Aldermaston to play with, as though our concern was not that BNFL is a dangerous incompetent but that it doesn't have deterrent capability. And when well-meaning worthies produce a mild report saying that lying to young people about drugs might undermine the government's credibility, the reaction is: \"Don't listen kids! One puff on a pot-hash butt and you'll be hooked on loco weed!\" The police are saying: \"Look, Mr Straw, we love nicking people, but even we get bored with dope-smokers and refugees.\" But Straw will not rest until half the country is in detention. And his response to calls for open government is: \"Trust me - you don't want to know.\" The government tries to appeal to us in consumer language -\"cutting out the middle man\". That would be elected councillors, juries, trade unions, all those people with a duty to uphold our rights, getting in the way when all we want is to be ruled, sentenced and managed. In fact, wouldn't it be better if pay bargaining was replaced with decisions taken by local magistrates? Having its finger firmly on the pulse, the government realises people would like improvement in local services and so proposes \"cabinet style\" (closed) local government. Then perhaps Whitehall won't have to bypass councils because it will have recreated them in its own image. Then councils could have upper chambers with locally ennobled Blairite members, an appointed gentry. I'm brainstorming here, but the appointees could be local media types, magistrates, business-people and those mysterious, rootless people who become school governors, but don't appear to have any connection with schools. Just a suggestion. The trouble is Labour will probably have lost a load of councils by the time the Local Government Act is implemented. That must not have occurred to Labour.",

This was because they had all reported the speech already.

      "bodyText": "Muammar Gadafy will achieve a historic breakthrough in Libya's relations with the west when he meets European Union leaders at the first EU-Africa summit in Cairo on Monday. Working hard to shed his pariah status, Colonel Gadafy appears to be close to signing a declaration recognising Israel and accepting respect for democracy and human rights, diplomats said last night. Having finally handed over the two Lockerbie bombing suspects for trial, his subscribing to the principles of the 27-member Euro-Mediterranean forum - the so-called Barcelona process - is now all that stands between him and international respectability. Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, provoked a furious row in January when he agreed to meet the maverick Libyan leader, but was then forced into an embarrassing climbdown. No meeting between the two is scheduled, although Col Gadafy arrived in Egypt yesterday, so it would be extraordinary if an encounter did not take place during the two-day event. \"Something is moving on the Libyan side,\" Mr Prodi's spokesman said. \"There are encouraging signs of the Libyan government adopting a more open attitude to the Euro-Med dialogue.\" Europeans feel emboldened to bring Col Gadafy in from the cold because he has turned a new leaf on terrorism, and because of the importance of Libya's oil industry, but also because the US is now less hostile: this week it is sending its first official delegation to Tripoli for 20 years. The Cairo summit is designed to show that the EU has not forgotten Africa - ravaged by conflict and threatened by Aids, famine and marginalisation - after a decade of post-cold-war focus on eastern and central Europe. It is the brainchild of Portugal, current holder of the union's rotating presidency, which fought the continent's most bitter colonial wars in Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique but now has the best relations with its former colonies. Only a month ago the event seemed destined for disaster or oblivion, because Morocco refused point blank to attend if the Western Saharans were there. The EU is still Africa's biggest single source of emergency assistance and development aid through a variety of programmes, including the aid-and-trade pact concluded in February with 71 former colonies. African critics point out, however, that too much money has disappeared into the pockets of corrupt government officials, and accuse the European Commission of failing to keep tabs on its largesse. Social, economic and development issues are high on the Cairo agenda, as are debt relief and the fight against Aids, though the EU side has made it clear that it does not want a pledging conference. Oxfam is urging EU governments to agree a Compact for Africa, to mobilise $1.6bn a year, in advance of the forthcoming World Education Forum in Senegal. Suspicions remain strong. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Algerian president, warned that Africans would benefit only if they prevented Europeans from \"trying to sell more and more of their goods\". Only last month the EU and South Africa settled an acrimonious dispute that hinged largely on trivial questions about product names like grappa and ouzo, displaying a rich and self-satisfied trading bloc at its most selfish. Britain, represented in Cairo by Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, wants a sharp focus on conflict prevention - vital in a continent which still accounts for more than half the world's wars, draining resources from development projects and pouring them into refugee camps. Oxfam points to a sharp contrast between the EU's commitment to stopping violence in Kosovo and East Timor and the largely forgotten wars of Angola, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The EU puts a far greater emphasis on fostering relations with the continent's giants, such as South Africa, Nigeria and the Maghreb countries.",

      "body": "<p>However humble the house, if it's standing in a conservation area then it must be desirable. Estate agents leap on this status as a unique selling point and, in a slowing housing market, experts say the conservation area tag can add as much as \u00a320,000 to the value of a property.</p> <p>There are more than 8,000 conservation areas in England alone and the number is going up all the time, but there are downsides to enjoying the coveted status. Buyers could be in for a shock if they believe only the owners of listed buildings can be forced to take down porches and rip out replacement windows.</p> <p>Homeowners who want to move could find the tag attracts buyers in droves, while those who want to stay put and improve or extend their home may find their plans severely restricted.</p> <p>The planning battlefield is littered with casualties and, with this in mind, the government has commissioned English Heritage to draw up proposals to overhaul the system and speed up the decision-making process.</p> <p>Under planning laws local authorities can protect areas of \"special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\".</p> <p>In designated areas, councils have extra powers to control the demolition of buildings, minor developments and protection of trees. In practice this means that householders in conservation areas have to apply for planning permission to carry out tasks that other homeowners can do without reference to the council such as applying cladding, installing dormer windows and putting up satellite dishes visible from the street.</p> <p>Removing slate tiles from a roof and replacing them with concrete, changing the type of windows or demolishing a front wall to make way for an off-street parking space could all alter the unique character of an area, says Charles Wagner, English Heritage's adviser for London.</p> <p>Laws introduced in 1995 gave councils far-reaching powers to protest about even the smallest details. Subject to local consultation, planning officials can prevent householders erecting porches, painting their house a different colour, or changing their doors or windows - although they must have good reasons for making the restrictions.</p> <p>This applies even in some more modest areas: \"Quite often homeowners aren't aware that they're living in a conservation areas unless the previous owner has passed the information on,\" says Mr Wagner. \"Very often local authorities designate conservation areas if local opinion calls for it.\"</p> <p>Occasionally, areas are designated when the character of an area is threatened by an unsuitable development.</p> <p>Critics believe that councils are designating too many conservation areas and are devaluing the term in the process. There has to be sound architectural or historical reason behind the status.

      "bodyText": "However humble the house, if it's standing in a conservation area then it must be desirable. Estate agents leap on this status as a unique selling point and, in a slowing housing market, experts say the conservation area tag can add as much as \u00a320,000 to the value of a property. There are more than 8,000 conservation areas in England alone and the number is going up all the time, but there are downsides to enjoying the coveted status. Buyers could be in for a shock if they believe only the owners of listed buildings can be forced to take down porches and rip out replacement windows. Homeowners who want to move could find the tag attracts buyers in droves, while those who want to stay put and improve or extend their home may find their plans severely restricted. The planning battlefield is littered with casualties and, with this in mind, the government has commissioned English Heritage to draw up proposals to overhaul the system and speed up the decision-making process. Under planning laws local authorities can protect areas of \"special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\". In designated areas, councils have extra powers to control the demolition of buildings, minor developments and protection of trees. In practice this means that householders in conservation areas have to apply for planning permission to carry out tasks that other homeowners can do without reference to the council such as applying cladding, installing dormer windows and putting up satellite dishes visible from the street. Removing slate tiles from a roof and replacing them with concrete, changing the type of windows or demolishing a front wall to make way for an off-street parking space could all alter the unique character of an area, says Charles Wagner, English Heritage's adviser for London. Laws introduced in 1995 gave councils far-reaching powers to protest about even the smallest details. Subject to local consultation, planning officials can prevent householders erecting porches, painting their house a different colour, or changing their doors or windows - although they must have good reasons for making the restrictions. This applies even in some more modest areas: \"Quite often homeowners aren't aware that they're living in a conservation areas unless the previous owner has passed the information on,\" says Mr Wagner. \"Very often local authorities designate conservation areas if local opinion calls for it.\" Occasionally, areas are designated when the character of an area is threatened by an unsuitable development. Critics believe that councils are designating too many conservation areas and are devaluing the term in the process. There has to be sound architectural or historical reason behind the status. But over time our ideas change about what is and is not worth preserving for posterity. The announcement that Erno Goldfinger's concrete Trellick Tower in north Kensington, London was a conservation area was greeted with horror by traditionalists. Most people would appreciate why Georgian terraces might be classed as a conservation area, but less obvious gems include garden estates built after the war, or high streets. Local authorities have a duty to review conservation area boundaries from time to time and remove the status from areas that are no longer of special interest. Some see conservation area status as blocking progress and preventing environmental improvements. In Hounslow, west London, the council is digging its heels in over awarding the status to the centre of Brentford near the Grand Union Canal. The council wants developers to breathe new life into the area. English Heritage believes the regeneration should include protecting the locks, walls and bridges tucked away behind the high street and the organisation wants to designate the length of the Grand Union Canal that runs through Brentford as a conservation area. The council, for its part, says the move would be inappropriate, as much of the area includes buildings of little interest constructed in the 60s. Hounslow says it has employed consultants to review the impact of all the development schemes in Brentford and hopes to reach a compromise. If the situation becomes a stand-off, English Heritage could use its powers to override the council and go ahead with the designation anyway. For Mr Wagner, conserving the built environment is about \"balancing personal freedoms with protecting what people regard as local heritage\". Peter Studdert, vice-chair of the English Historic Towns Forum, says too many homeowners are in the dark about how living in a conservation area will affect them. Even dramatic makeovers aren't automatically ruled out, he says. But buyers with plans to turn a humble cottage into a glass and steel palace worthy of Norman Foster should check with their local authority before carrying out home improvements that would be visible from the street.",

      "body": "<p>The US and British governments bowed to domestic and international pressure yesterday by making a significant concession on sanctions against Iraq.</p> <p>The two countries have been left almost isolated in the international community by insisting on maintaining sanctions in spite of the catastrophic impact on civilians.</p> <p>The UN security council, where the US and Britain have in the past used their vetoes to prevent any weakening of the sanctions regime, yesterday agreed to double the amount of money that Iraq could be permitted to use for oil spare parts. The US had been blocking the concession for months.</p> <p>Iraq needs to export oil to pay for food, medicine and other goods but its oil industry, badly damaged in the Gulf war in 1991, has been struggling to cope and is in desperate need of spare parts.</p> <p>Both the US and Britain have been heavily criticised in recent months for refusing to relax the sanctions regime, which was introduced in 1990 to try to topple the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, but which has subsequently been used to try to prevent him rebuilding his weapons arsenal.</p> <p>The biggest blow to the US and British position came with the resignation of the UN representative in Baghdad, Hans von Sponek, in protest at the impact of sanctions on the civilian population. More than a million people are alleged to have died as a result of sanctions. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has described sanctions as a blunt instrument, and last year recommended a doubling in the amount that could be spent on oil spare parts.</p> <p>All 15 ambassadors at the UN security council yesterday voted in favour of a US-sponsored resolution to implement the change.</p> <p>The resolution allows Iraq to spend $600m every six months and says the council would consider reviewing that amount in future six-month phases. It also says the council will be willing to consider other ways of improving the oil-for-food programme.</p> <p>The US and British governments, anxious to deflect criticism, had opted to expand the humanitarian part of the sanctions regime, allowing more cash to be made available to buy food and medicine.</p> <p>The British Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, said last night: \"Iraq has no excuse not to provide the food, medicines, clean water, electricity, agricultural supplies and educational material the people of Iraq need.\"</p> <p>The British government pushed through before Christmas a UN resolution, 1284, in which sanctions would be lifted provided Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors back into Iraq and they reported back that president Saddam was not hiding weapons of mass destruction. Mr Hain last night urged the Iraqi government to comply with that resolution.</p> <p>The head of the weapons inspectorate, Hans Blix, is currently in New York preparing a proposal to put to Iraq. But the Iraqi government has already rejected the resolution and is becoming increasingly confident that the resolve of the West to maintain sanctions is disintegrating.</p> <p>Although yesterday's security council decision showed that the sanctions regime was crumbling at the edges, there is little chance of it being lifted until well after the US presidential election in November. The Iraqi deputy president, Tariq Aziz, said he did not expect any compromise until next year at the earliest.</p> <p>During a debate on sanctions at the UN last week, the US and British position was criticised by Mr Annan and by the ambassadors of a wide range of countries. One of the biggest complaints was that the US was paralysing the Iraq oil industry by putting spare parts on hold in the UN sanctions committee, claiming that the parts could have a dual use and that president Saddam might divert them to biological, chemical or other weapons programmes.</p> <p>In spite of yesterday's vote, the US and Britain could continue to use the UN sanctions committee to block many supplies to Iraq. About 98% of the objections are made by the US, and the remainder by Britain.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The US and British governments bowed to domestic and international pressure yesterday by making a significant concession on sanctions against Iraq. The two countries have been left almost isolated in the international community by insisting on maintaining sanctions in spite of the catastrophic impact on civilians. The UN security council, where the US and Britain have in the past used their vetoes to prevent any weakening of the sanctions regime, yesterday agreed to double the amount of money that Iraq could be permitted to use for oil spare parts. The US had been blocking the concession for months. Iraq needs to export oil to pay for food, medicine and other goods but its oil industry, badly damaged in the Gulf war in 1991, has been struggling to cope and is in desperate need of spare parts. Both the US and Britain have been heavily criticised in recent months for refusing to relax the sanctions regime, which was introduced in 1990 to try to topple the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, but which has subsequently been used to try to prevent him rebuilding his weapons arsenal. The biggest blow to the US and British position came with the resignation of the UN representative in Baghdad, Hans von Sponek, in protest at the impact of sanctions on the civilian population. More than a million people are alleged to have died as a result of sanctions. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has described sanctions as a blunt instrument, and last year recommended a doubling in the amount that could be spent on oil spare parts. All 15 ambassadors at the UN security council yesterday voted in favour of a US-sponsored resolution to implement the change. The resolution allows Iraq to spend $600m every six months and says the council would consider reviewing that amount in future six-month phases. It also says the council will be willing to consider other ways of improving the oil-for-food programme. The US and British governments, anxious to deflect criticism, had opted to expand the humanitarian part of the sanctions regime, allowing more cash to be made available to buy food and medicine. The British Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, said last night: \"Iraq has no excuse not to provide the food, medicines, clean water, electricity, agricultural supplies and educational material the people of Iraq need.\" The British government pushed through before Christmas a UN resolution, 1284, in which sanctions would be lifted provided Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors back into Iraq and they reported back that president Saddam was not hiding weapons of mass destruction. Mr Hain last night urged the Iraqi government to comply with that resolution. The head of the weapons inspectorate, Hans Blix, is currently in New York preparing a proposal to put to Iraq. But the Iraqi government has already rejected the resolution and is becoming increasingly confident that the resolve of the West to maintain sanctions is disintegrating. Although yesterday's security council decision showed that the sanctions regime was crumbling at the edges, there is little chance of it being lifted until well after the US presidential election in November. The Iraqi deputy president, Tariq Aziz, said he did not expect any compromise until next year at the earliest. During a debate on sanctions at the UN last week, the US and British position was criticised by Mr Annan and by the ambassadors of a wide range of countries. One of the biggest complaints was that the US was paralysing the Iraq oil industry by putting spare parts on hold in the UN sanctions committee, claiming that the parts could have a dual use and that president Saddam might divert them to biological, chemical or other weapons programmes. In spite of yesterday's vote, the US and Britain could continue to use the UN sanctions committee to block many supplies to Iraq. About 98% of the objections are made by the US, and the remainder by Britain.",

      "body": "<p>It was soon after Duwayne Brooks announced that he was going to sue the police for racial harassment that his life took a turn for the worse. And life wasn't too clever to start with. Seven years ago, Brooks and his best friend, Stephen Lawrence, were attacked by a gang of racist thugs. While Lawrence was knifed to death, Brooks lived to tell the tale - though many people refused to believe it. The Metropolitan Police found it incomprehensible that a white group could have attacked Stephen and Duwayne, both of them 18, just because of the colour of their skin; they must have been provoked. When the traumatised Brooks gave a statement on the night of the murder, he was labelled arrogant and surly, and accused of taking a can of Coke out of the police fridge without permission. The police even regarded him as a possible suspect. Sir William Macpherson's report into the police's handling of the Lawrence killing concluded: \"We do not believe that a young white man would have been dealt with in that way.\" </p> <p>Brooks went on to suffer from post- traumatic stress, some would say a breakdown. But last year it looked as if he was at last beginning to come through. I met him soon after he announced that he was suing the police. He was not bringing the case solely because of what happened in the police station on the night, he told me; it was the way they had treated him throughout. </p> <p>A year on from Macpherson's report, which concluded that the Metropolitan police is institutionally racist, the police insist that things are changing, that racism is being eradicated. But the story of Duwayne Brooks suggests that nothing has changed. The treat ment of this young man, who readily agreed to be a witness despite the personal risk, is at least as shocking as the half-hearted investigation into Stephen's death. There was rightly an outcry, when Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, was stopped and searched on one occasion; Brooks says he has lost count of the number of times he has been stopped and searched. Even before the latest fiasco at the Old Bailey - when a sexual assault case against him was summarily thrown out last week - he had been arrested five times when charges were either never brought, or were dropped or defeated. On two occasions Brooks, a photo-copier engineer, was accused of possession of offensive weapons which turned out to be part of his work kit. On August 17 last year, he was accused of taking and driving away a car - his car. </p> <p>He told me then that he was frightened because his address had been accidentally read out in court and printed by newspapers. Four days after my interview appeared, his flat was broken into and, when the police arrived, they discovered that the covert video camera they had installed didn't have any tape in it (as a witness to Lawrence's murder who gave evidence, he had been given protected-person status). Brooks complained that they were not taking his safety very seriously - it made another news story. </p> <p>I couldn't get Brooks out of my mind. He was the most difficult person I'd interviewed - a bewildering mix of arrogance and vulnerability. He spent most of the time berating me: why did I not have shorthand, why had I run out of questions, why did I smoke, why did I eat red meat, why did I drink? When he wasn't scolding me, he was scolding the Guardian - notably the front-page headline, \"Blacks lose out on 2000 funds\". It was racist, he said. \"You never hear about whites, do you? Blacks are black people, not blacks, right? Who writes these headlines?\" </p> <p>Occasionally, he seemed boyish or laddish. Most of the time, he seemed old beyond his years. He often talked of himself in the third person, as if he was a character, or a series of characters. Brooks, the victim, who could so easily have been Stephen Lawrence had he not run. Brooks, the guilty survivor, who could not forgive himself for not being there when the gang attacked (though he returned as soon as he realised Stephen hadn't run). Brooks, the hero, who was singlehandedly taking on the police and exposing its rotten, racist core. And Brooks, the terrified kid in the sharp blue suit and starched white shirt, who believed he would end up at the bottom of the Thames. This was the Brooks who patted his tummy and said, \"Look how skinny I am. Stress makes you forget to eat.\" </p> <p>It was on September 17 1999, around 10 days after he had questioned the police's commitment to his protection, that it was reported that Duwayne Brooks had been charged with attempted rape and indecent assault, and had been refused bail. There were no other details. I was desperate to find out what had happened, but found myself holding back. What if he had done it? What if he had really flipped? Would it be that surprising, considering all that had happened to him? </p> <p>Eventually, I spoke to his lawyer, Darren White, who said that, after a few days in custody, Duwayne had been granted bail - he had to move out of London to Birmingham, he was under an 11pm curfew and \u00a320,000 bail had to be raised to allow him even this degree of liberty. White had not worked with Brooks before, didn't know him well, but thought he was probably innocent. He was professional, but didn't seem overly exercised by the case. White thought the allegation was the result of a messy argument, and was surprised by the severity of the bail conditions. He then went on to talk, at great length, about the woes of his football team, Sheffield United. </p> <p>In early November, Brooks was allowed back to London, on condition that he steered clear of south London, where the alleged assault took place. He remained under the 11pm curfew. We agreed to meet. Despite the tensions of our previous encounter, he greeted me like an old friend. Blue suit and starched white shirt, of course, firm handshake. We went for a disgusting Chinese meal, and he complained, as is his wont, about the lack of chicken in the sweet-and-sour chicken. He was right, too - there was no chicken in the chicken. Just as the fresh orange he had ordered during our previous meeting wasn't fresh. </p> <p>I asked him if there was anything in the allegations. \"Oh, they dropped the attempted rape,\" he said. \"They didn't even bother to tell us. We just found out at the committal. By then, it had been in all the newspapers, of course.\" And the indecent assault? \"What it is about is me refusing to give a girl a lift home.\" </p> <p> He then told me a story so messy and tedious, it was hard not to believe it. In short: the complainant was an old friend who had asked to visit him at the hostel where he had been moved after his previous address had been revealed in the press. After he refused to give her a lift home, she rang the police and said she had been assaulted and could they please come and collect her. By the time the police arrived, she had changed her story, saying that nothing untoward had happened but could she please have a lift home, anyway. So what he was guilty of? \"I was horrible to her, but that's not a crime, is it?\" He was arrested 12 days after the alleged assault. \"The police were apparently waiting outside my premises all day long. What do they call it, 'a stakeout'?\" </p> <p>After Brooks was charged, Darren White told him that, if there had been sexual contact and he admitted it, he was unlikely to be convicted because they could argue it was consensual. \"But I don't make up stories to give myself an easy ride,\" said Brooks. \"If the truth is the hardest ride, then so be it. I said no, no, no, no . . . I've never touched this girl, and that's how it stayed. I'm not changing the story, I'm sticking with that.\" </p> <p>\"Sticking with my story\", \"the truth\": Brooks understands the full weight of these words. So much of his adult life has been spent giving evidence of one type or another. After the crown declared there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the five boys suspected of Stephen's murder, the Lawrence family brought a private prosecution; Brooks was the lead witness, in many ways the only witness. But he couldn't remember the details of the incident well enough - after all, the attack and stabbing were over in seconds. At one time, he identified the stabber as having short dark hair, at another as having a mop of frizzy hair. The judge declared that he was an unreliable witness; the case collapsed before the suspects were called. Macpherson's report criticised the Lawrences' solicitor for encouraging Brooks to give evidence when he was clearly suffering from post-traumatic stress. </p> <p>It hurts so much when he talks about having his evidence rejected that he slurs his words. \"It was . . . destroying . There was a report from a doctor saying I wasn't ready to give evidence, but you know how headstrong solicitors can be. I was summonsed by the Lawrence team. And if I'd turned round at the time and said I'm not giving evidence and went wibbly wobbly and collapsed, they would have blamed me again. I was stuck in a situation I couldn't get out of.\" </p> <p>\"Is it something that . . .\" I began, and Brooks continued, \". . . pisses me off? Yes . Yes, they blame me. 'Vital witness changes evidence in court' - wasn't that the headline? I just got muddled up, and every chance I had to unmuddle what I was saying it was just getting worse and worse.\" He winces. </p> <p>It's now November, and Brooks seems anything but muddled. Despite the charge hanging over him, he's far more relaxed than the first time we met. I tell him that, if this had happened to me, I would have gone under. Why is he so calm? \"Because I know the police have been trying to get me for any tiny little thing for ages.\" He says it with quiet and shocking certainty. </p> <p>It seems inconceivable that the police could be exercising a vendetta against Brooks. After all, he is the sole survivor of the attack, and the Met have often said that they still hope to charge the youths responsible for the assault on Duwayne Brooks. At the same time, both the government and the Met have reiterated their commitment to eradicating racism within the police. And yet there is this unfortunate record of arrests and failed prosecutions against Brooks. Macpherson said that the police had racially stereotyped Duwayne at the time of Stephen's murder, and the catalogue of charges against him since then suggests that little has changed. Virtually every time he has been arrested, it has been the result of a stop-and-search while driving. He takes me through a few of his favourites. Last year, he was arrested, taken to the police station and, when he returned to his car, it had been broken into and a fax machine was missing from inside. The police reimbursed his employers for the machine within days. Brooks's car has been broken into many times over the past seven years. Once, the police even accused him of breaking into his own car to gain attention. Another incident that tickles him is his arrest under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, after the police discovered some boxes in the back of his car. \"How many black IRA members have you seen?\" The boxes contained photocopy toner. </p> <p>Why would the police want to harass him? \"Those writs I issued against those officers, that's what it's about. Because I don't wish to sit down and put up with the status quo, that's what it all boils down to, really. If I don't sue those officers and nothing gets done, it just happens again and again and again. We hear all those things - the Met is changing, the Met is doing this and that, but the Met is not changing. The Met will stay the same. They will never change, because the government does not want them to change.\" </p> <p>The Metropolitan police have been trying to \"strike out\" his claim of racial harassment. A police statement says: \"We are not prepared to discuss the reasons for our application to strike out the claims. Complex legal arguments are involved, which we feel are more appropriately addressed in court.\" One argument is that Brooks is too late to sue - a complaint should be launched within six months of the alleged harassment. A decision was pending this week. </p> <p>The Met are also trying to strike out the Lawrences' claim for racism. The difference is that, while Brooks has been offered nothing, the police have already offered Doreen and Neville Lawrence \u00a350,000 compensation each. Brooks argues that the harassment has been on-going, and that he's not interested in a financial settlement, anyway. He wants an apology from the Commissioner, and for the guilty officers to be disciplined or sacked. </p> <p>Brooks has been called racist, anti-white, by officers. \"I said, why would I have a white solicitor if I were racist?\" As suspicious as he is of people he doesn't know, he is steadfast to those who have won his trust. He repeatedly tells me to say how brilliant his lawyers have been over the years - Jane Deighton, Vicky Guedalla, Darren White and Julia Krish. His legal team, he says, has been given no credit, while the newspapers always mention the work done by Imran Khan and Michael Mansfield for the Lawrence family. He points out that it was his legal team who suggested that the Race Relations Act should be expanded to cover the police - probably the most important recommendation to emerge from Macpherson. </p> <p>Perhaps it is as inevitable as it is sad that there should be a split between Brooks and the Lawrences. Doreen Lawrence never approved of her son's friend. One of Duwayne's friends tells me that what has hurt him most over the years was the feeling that the Lawrences partly blame him for what happened to their son. Doreen Lawrence told the inquiry: \"He [Stephen] had been quite strict about being home on time, but after the influence of Duwayne, where Duwayne was allowed to come and go as he pleased, it was different.\" Brooks has taken a lonely road. He has always said he hated the way various race groups tried to exploit the situation; he has always said you should never belong to others. But perhaps it's also true that no one wanted to claim Brooks. </p> <p>Brooks comes out with things that other people might not. He says that when he was younger he used to play for all-black football teams and couldn't stand it. \"Most black boys would prefer to play in a white team because you don't get the arguments, you don't get the selfish behaviour of people thinking they're flash and don't want to pass the football. What managers do these days is they have all white people at the back, and they have black people on the wing and up front because they can run faster; they have white people at the back because they can tackle harder.\" Is he a good footballer? \"Brilliant. If I were fitter, I could play in the Premiership.\" </p> <p>I ask whether Stephen was a good footballer. \"No,\" he says, \"but he was a good runner.\" He stops, aware of the unbearable irony. When he talks about Stephen and their friendship, and the unfairness of it all, the laddishness is replaced by a groping tenderness. \"There was a group of us, and he was the softest person out of all of us - not physically, he was stronger, fitter than me - but his mind was softer. Steve would tolerate a lot of things that other people would lose their patience over.\" It's jolting when he calls him Steve: a reminder that he was a real boy, not just the victim the rest of us came to know. Duwayne was more streetwise than Stephen, and tried to protect him. Just before the fatal attack, he had warned Stephen to run, but his friend couldn't understand why they were in any danger. </p> <p>Brooks has an alarming scar that runs along the back of his neck. How did he get it? He tells me there have been three occasions when he almost died. One was when he was crossing the road, was hit by a car, went through the windscreen and ended up with this scar. The second was when he was swimming in the sea in Jamaica and got trapped under a coral reef. I begin to ask about the third time, and find myself flushed with embarrassment. </p> <p>He offers to drive me to the tube. I tell him not to be daft, it's only a five-minute walk. \"Okay then. I'll ring you to make sure you get back safe.\" And so he does. </p> <p>Many people believe that the decision to prosecute Brooks is related to his civil action against the police. As Darren White says, \"You're going to have much less credibility when you sue the police if you have a sex offence against your name.\" The Movement for Justice claims the Metropolitan police has a vendetta against Brooks and that he has been the victim of a malicious prosecution. When I ask the Met for comment, a spokesman says: \"We take all allegations of crime very seriously, and will investigate all allegations of crime that are put to us.\" Meanwhile a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service says: \"The judge made no specific criticism of the CPS. What criticism that was made was directed at the police.\" </p> <p>But maybe the story goes further back. When Stephen Lawrence died, neither he nor Brooks had a criminal record. The police found this hard to believe. A few months after the murder, Brooks was charged with violent disorder at the Welling demonstration against the British National Party. Even though there were photographs of him with a stick raised and one in which it looked as if he was helping to overturn a car, the judge stayed the case. There were hundreds of people shown in similar pictures, and Brooks was obviously not one of the ringleaders; he was nevertheless one of only a handful of people charged. The judge said that not only was there insufficient evidence against him, not only could it prejudice a case against the killers of Stephen Lawrence, but that Brooks was under such stress he was not accountable for his actions at the time. </p> <p>The police seem to have found the ruling hard to bear. As well as the myriad charges laid against Brooks, and subsequently dropped, since Stephen's death, there have been three convictions for minor offences: cannabis possession; attempt to deceive, for having dodgy driving insurance (would you know if the numbers on your insurance were wrong, asks Brooks); and driving away from a garage without paying (he hadn't realised he had no money, offered to go and get some, the garage attendant wasn't interested, a row ensued and Brooks drove off without paying his \u00a39.60). </p> <p> It's late January 2000, and I am talking to a stunned Darren White, who has just received witness statements from the Crown Prosecution Service concerning the alleged indecent assault. \"I can't believe this case. It will never stand up in court. There is no way this should be going ahead. I've never seen a clearer example of a prosecution that should not go ahead. Call me naive, but I'm shocked.\" So shocked that he can't even be bothered to update me on Sheffield United's disastrous run. </p> <p>One of the recommendations in the Macpherson report held that a lay mediator, a member of the public, should be used to offer victim support in cases where the complainant belongs to an ethnic minority and feels that might prejudice the complainant's relationship with the police. Brooks's case is the first time such a mediator has been used. She has seen the complainant around a dozen times, and is so concerned by the different stories she has heard from her that she goes to the police and tells them that she has grave doubts about the case. The complainant has told the mediator that she didn't think she wanted to press ahead with the charge; she also says that Brooks hadn't assaulted her - that he had just \"sat there\". To add to the confusion, the mediator's statement is unfinished and unsigned, but dated back to November. It is not for another six weeks that the police ask her to sign the statement. She refuses, saying it is inaccurate. The police fail to ask her in what way. </p> <p>By this time, White also has something approximating a chronology of events. On September 4 - the night the young woman made her complaint - she rang the police and said that Brooks had attempted to rape her. By the time the police arrived, she had changed her story, saying that there had been no assault. The police visited her twice over the next week, encouraging her to file a complaint - on each occasion she refused. It is also recorded that DI Sturge said that should the complainant wish to get in touch with him, he was available 24 hours a day. </p> <p>According to White, \"A senior officer showing this level of commitment to a complainant who has made it clear that she doesn't wish to substantiate her allegation is very strange. The police are always complaining how scarce their resources are, and here's DI Sturge on call for 24 hours to a complainant who doesn't want to go to court. What's going on?\" On September 15, following a number of phone calls from Brooks, the complainant called the police and said she wanted him arrested. </p> <p>White is also now aware why Brooks had initially been refused bail. In the custody record, it is written that bail should not be granted because the suspect is likely to \"1) Interfere with witnesses. 2) Commit further offences. The grounds given for this being that, since the time of the offence, the victim has been telephoned by the suspect, where further threats of rape had been made to her, 10 calls being made on the 15th September . . . DI Sturge confirmed that there is a record of these calls to the victim.\" White asked for the record of the phone calls, but the prosecution failed to provide them. When Brooks's legal team finally obtained a record for themselves, it showed that he had made three very short phone calls to the complainant on the 15th before his arrest. Brooks says he rang her to apologise for not giving her a lift home, but that she had put the phone down on him before he could get the words out. The complainant's statement confirms that she put the phone down on him, and there is no mention of threats of rape. </p> <p>It's February, and Brooks is at Woolwich Crown Court, in south-east London, alongside his small but vocal army of supporters. His two sisters, his mother and his grandmother are also there. He doesn't want me to interview his family. Why not? \"Because I don't involve my family in anything that's happening to me.\" Is he close to his family? \"No, I'm not close to anybody, because when they can't get you, they get the next best, and if I'm close to my mum it will be: they can't get Duwayne, let's get his mum; they can't get Duwayne, let's get his sister.\" Does he love them? \" Yes !\" He looks amazed that it could be otherwise. \"I love all my friends and family.\" </p> <p>Members of the anti-racist group, Movement for Justice, are being advised by their leader, Alex Owolade: \"If you see the mediator, we must smile. All we want is for her to tell the truth. And the same with the complainant. You have to show her respect. She's a victim, too.\" I ask him what he means. He says he believes she has been pressurised to continue with the allegation. There are rumours circulating the tiny courtroom: that the complainant has been told she may be given a flat as a protected witness if she testifies; that she may be able to sue for compensation; that she has been told by the police that, if she doesn't testify, she could be arrested. </p> <p>The trial quickly descends into low farce. Brooks's supporters cannot fit in the tiny courtroom, and protest about it. The complainant's mother is due to give evidence, but is on holiday in Florida. The judge is angry, and adjourns the case, stressing that it is because the mother is an important witness. A new date is set in March for the highest criminal court in London, the Old Bailey. </p> <p>As we leave court, Duwayne's grandmother tells him off for not being more chatty. His sisters ask how he could be expected to do his job when he's banned from south London. Brooks says, \"They wanted me to lose my job, to break me down. But they can't take my job away from me, because I am the best worker in that place . And if you ask my boss he'll tell you.\" He's at his arrogant best. \"Listen, when I started at that firm I was working on \u00a360 a week and that firm was in crisis and I got them out of that crisis doing all the hard work.\" He says there is no photocopying machine that he couldn't fix. </p> <p>I ask him whether there is anything he's not good at. \"Big words. I'm bad at big words because I never studied that at school. I've never done verbs and adjectives. I couldn't even tell you what a verb is.\" He says this will not stop him writing his life story. Stephen was the academic one, the boy who was going to be the architect. Duwayne always knew it was important to do well at school, always tried his best, but he could never understand how, when he spent hours poring over his English homework, he would get a worse mark than when he rushed it. </p> <p>Duwayne had already left school when he was attacked. After Stephen was killed, he withdrew from everyone. Just as he was overcoming one shock, there would be another in store. He discovered that a police officer who was protecting him was a friend of the gangster, Clifford Norris, father of one of the suspects, David Norris. Another time he was playing pool in a pub and looked up to discover that the next player was one of the suspected killers of Stephen. He walked out. </p> <p>Does he think he had a breakdown? \"I don't know. As far as I'm concerned, I didn't change. I was just more quiet, didn't really go nowhere.\" Did his friends say he had changed? \"Oh yes. My friends noticed how my attitude changed, how my personality changed, but to me I was just sad.\" At times he was seen walking down the street, lost, muttering to himself about the killers. </p> <p>Since the conditions of his bail were changed and he was allowed to return to London, Brooks has been living with a close friend. He asks me not to name her. She has only known him for two years, but says that the change in him just over that period of time is amazing. \"He's much more confident, outward-going. You see how he talks to me. I told him he had a voice, and he should use it to talk to people, talk about injustice.\" She says it's funny that she has never been in any bother in her life, never had anything bad happen to her, but since Brooks has moved into her house she's had her car broken into twice. \"Maybe people will come for me now.\" </p> <p>Brooks agrees that he has changed, been politicised. He recently went to Northern Ireland and shared a platform with a family campaigning about sectarian killing and RUC neglect. </p> <p> Another day, another court case. This time, we're in one of the most salubrious parts of London, Regent's Park, as the Metropolitan Police argue that Brooks's racism case should be struck out. Outside, a little scene is being played out. A posh elderly woman shouts, \"We're living in a police state, and I'm willing to go to prison for saying so.\" The rasta who has been at every one of Brooks's court appearances quietly ticks her off. \"You not been there, lady, have you? Prison is the worst possible place, you know. They break you in prison.\" The barrister for the Police Federation starts proceedings by saying that whatever points he is going to make, they do not detract from the sympathy he offers to Mr Brooks for all that he has been through. He then launches into the most cynical, legalistic argument for why Brooks is not owed an apology from the police. Brooks sits there with his hands on his chin, stroking the beginnings of a goatee. What's he thinking about? </p> <p>The attack on Stephen and himself has defined his life - in many ways destroyed it, in some ways made it. As he reminds me when he's feeling most chipper: \"Duwayne Brooks's evidence rocked the inquiry, it opened up everybody's eyes. If Duwayne Brooks had decided not to give evidence, not to give police statements, there would have been no investigation into the murder. If Duwayne Brooks had not decided to follow his friend that way, there would have been no suspects.\" </p> <p>The Old Bailey, March. Darren White says that he is going to try and have the sexual assault case thrown out as an abuse of process. He warns me to be prepared for an intense legalistic debate. A month after the defence asked for the updated notes of one of the officers, WPC Chapman, they have still not received them. Eventually, the notes arrive in court and confirm that, when the complainant suggested not going ahead, WPC Chapman met her and told her that, as a fully-bound witness, she could be arrested.

      "bodyText": "It was soon after Duwayne Brooks announced that he was going to sue the police for racial harassment that his life took a turn for the worse. And life wasn't too clever to start with. Seven years ago, Brooks and his best friend, Stephen Lawrence, were attacked by a gang of racist thugs. While Lawrence was knifed to death, Brooks lived to tell the tale - though many people refused to believe it. The Metropolitan Police found it incomprehensible that a white group could have attacked Stephen and Duwayne, both of them 18, just because of the colour of their skin; they must have been provoked. When the traumatised Brooks gave a statement on the night of the murder, he was labelled arrogant and surly, and accused of taking a can of Coke out of the police fridge without permission. The police even regarded him as a possible suspect. Sir William Macpherson's report into the police's handling of the Lawrence killing concluded: \"We do not believe that a young white man would have been dealt with in that way.\" Brooks went on to suffer from post- traumatic stress, some would say a breakdown. But last year it looked as if he was at last beginning to come through. I met him soon after he announced that he was suing the police. He was not bringing the case solely because of what happened in the police station on the night, he told me; it was the way they had treated him throughout. A year on from Macpherson's report, which concluded that the Metropolitan police is institutionally racist, the police insist that things are changing, that racism is being eradicated. But the story of Duwayne Brooks suggests that nothing has changed. The treat ment of this young man, who readily agreed to be a witness despite the personal risk, is at least as shocking as the half-hearted investigation into Stephen's death. There was rightly an outcry, when Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, was stopped and searched on one occasion; Brooks says he has lost count of the number of times he has been stopped and searched. Even before the latest fiasco at the Old Bailey - when a sexual assault case against him was summarily thrown out last week - he had been arrested five times when charges were either never brought, or were dropped or defeated. On two occasions Brooks, a photo-copier engineer, was accused of possession of offensive weapons which turned out to be part of his work kit. On August 17 last year, he was accused of taking and driving away a car - his car. He told me then that he was frightened because his address had been accidentally read out in court and printed by newspapers. Four days after my interview appeared, his flat was broken into and, when the police arrived, they discovered that the covert video camera they had installed didn't have any tape in it (as a witness to Lawrence's murder who gave evidence, he had been given protected-person status). Brooks complained that they were not taking his safety very seriously - it made another news story. I couldn't get Brooks out of my mind. He was the most difficult person I'd interviewed - a bewildering mix of arrogance and vulnerability. He spent most of the time berating me: why did I not have shorthand, why had I run out of questions, why did I smoke, why did I eat red meat, why did I drink? When he wasn't scolding me, he was scolding the Guardian - notably the front-page headline, \"Blacks lose out on 2000 funds\". It was racist, he said. \"You never hear about whites, do you? Blacks are black people, not blacks, right? Who writes these headlines?\" Occasionally, he seemed boyish or laddish. Most of the time, he seemed old beyond his years. He often talked of himself in the third person, as if he was a character, or a series of characters. Brooks, the victim, who could so easily have been Stephen Lawrence had he not run. Brooks, the guilty survivor, who could not forgive himself for not being there when the gang attacked (though he returned as soon as he realised Stephen hadn't run). Brooks, the hero, who was singlehandedly taking on the police and exposing its rotten, racist core. And Brooks, the terrified kid in the sharp blue suit and starched white shirt, who believed he would end up at the bottom of the Thames. This was the Brooks who patted his tummy and said, \"Look how skinny I am. Stress makes you forget to eat.\" It was on September 17 1999, around 10 days after he had questioned the police's commitment to his protection, that it was reported that Duwayne Brooks had been charged with attempted rape and indecent assault, and had been refused bail. There were no other details. I was desperate to find out what had happened, but found myself holding back. What if he had done it? What if he had really flipped? Would it be that surprising, considering all that had happened to him? Eventually, I spoke to his lawyer, Darren White, who said that, after a few days in custody, Duwayne had been granted bail - he had to move out of London to Birmingham, he was under an 11pm curfew and \u00a320,000 bail had to be raised to allow him even this degree of liberty. White had not worked with Brooks before, didn't know him well, but thought he was probably innocent. He was professional, but didn't seem overly exercised by the case. White thought the allegation was the result of a messy argument, and was surprised by the severity of the bail conditions. He then went on to talk, at great length, about the woes of his football team, Sheffield United. In early November, Brooks was allowed back to London, on condition that he steered clear of south London, where the alleged assault took place. He remained under the 11pm curfew. We agreed to meet. Despite the tensions of our previous encounter, he greeted me like an old friend. Blue suit and starched white shirt, of course, firm handshake. We went for a disgusting Chinese meal, and he complained, as is his wont, about the lack of chicken in the sweet-and-sour chicken. He was right, too - there was no chicken in the chicken. Just as the fresh orange he had ordered during our previous meeting wasn't fresh. I asked him if there was anything in the allegations. \"Oh, they dropped the attempted rape,\" he said. \"They didn't even bother to tell us. We just found out at the committal. By then, it had been in all the newspapers, of course.\" And the indecent assault? \"What it is about is me refusing to give a girl a lift home.\" He then told me a story so messy and tedious, it was hard not to believe it. In short: the complainant was an old friend who had asked to visit him at the hostel where he had been moved after his previous address had been revealed in the press. After he refused to give her a lift home, she rang the police and said she had been assaulted and could they please come and collect her. By the time the police arrived, she had changed her story, saying that nothing untoward had happened but could she please have a lift home, anyway. So what he was guilty of? \"I was horrible to her, but that's not a crime, is it?\" He was arrested 12 days after the alleged assault. \"The police were apparently waiting outside my premises all day long. What do they call it, 'a stakeout'?\" After Brooks was charged, Darren White told him that, if there had been sexual contact and he admitted it, he was unlikely to be convicted because they could argue it was consensual. \"But I don't make up stories to give myself an easy ride,\" said Brooks. \"If the truth is the hardest ride, then so be it. I said no, no, no, no . . . I've never touched this girl, and that's how it stayed. I'm not changing the story, I'm sticking with that.\" \"Sticking with my story\", \"the truth\": Brooks understands the full weight of these words. So much of his adult life has been spent giving evidence of one type or another. After the crown declared there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the five boys suspected of Stephen's murder, the Lawrence family brought a private prosecution; Brooks was the lead witness, in many ways the only witness. But he couldn't remember the details of the incident well enough - after all, the attack and stabbing were over in seconds. At one time, he identified the stabber as having short dark hair, at another as having a mop of frizzy hair. The judge declared that he was an unreliable witness; the case collapsed before the suspects were called. Macpherson's report criticised the Lawrences' solicitor for encouraging Brooks to give evidence when he was clearly suffering from post-traumatic stress. It hurts so much when he talks about having his evidence rejected that he slurs his words. \"It was . . . destroying . There was a report from a doctor saying I wasn't ready to give evidence, but you know how headstrong solicitors can be. I was summonsed by the Lawrence team. And if I'd turned round at the time and said I'm not giving evidence and went wibbly wobbly and collapsed, they would have blamed me again. I was stuck in a situation I couldn't get out of.\" \"Is it something that . . .\" I began, and Brooks continued, \". . . pisses me off? Yes . Yes, they blame me. 'Vital witness changes evidence in court' - wasn't that the headline? I just got muddled up, and every chance I had to unmuddle what I was saying it was just getting worse and worse.\" He winces. It's now November, and Brooks seems anything but muddled. Despite the charge hanging over him, he's far more relaxed than the first time we met. I tell him that, if this had happened to me, I would have gone under. Why is he so calm? \"Because I know the police have been trying to get me for any tiny little thing for ages.\" He says it with quiet and shocking certainty. It seems inconceivable that the police could be exercising a vendetta against Brooks. After all, he is the sole survivor of the attack, and the Met have often said that they still hope to charge the youths responsible for the assault on Duwayne Brooks. At the same time, both the government and the Met have reiterated their commitment to eradicating racism within the police. And yet there is this unfortunate record of arrests and failed prosecutions against Brooks. Macpherson said that the police had racially stereotyped Duwayne at the time of Stephen's murder, and the catalogue of charges against him since then suggests that little has changed. Virtually every time he has been arrested, it has been the result of a stop-and-search while driving. He takes me through a few of his favourites. Last year, he was arrested, taken to the police station and, when he returned to his car, it had been broken into and a fax machine was missing from inside. The police reimbursed his employers for the machine within days. Brooks's car has been broken into many times over the past seven years. Once, the police even accused him of breaking into his own car to gain attention. Another incident that tickles him is his arrest under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, after the police discovered some boxes in the back of his car. \"How many black IRA members have you seen?\" The boxes contained photocopy toner. Why would the police want to harass him? \"Those writs I issued against those officers, that's what it's about. Because I don't wish to sit down and put up with the status quo, that's what it all boils down to, really. If I don't sue those officers and nothing gets done, it just happens again and again and again. We hear all those things - the Met is changing, the Met is doing this and that, but the Met is not changing. The Met will stay the same. They will never change, because the government does not want them to change.\" The Metropolitan police have been trying to \"strike out\" his claim of racial harassment. A police statement says: \"We are not prepared to discuss the reasons for our application to strike out the claims. Complex legal arguments are involved, which we feel are more appropriately addressed in court.\" One argument is that Brooks is too late to sue - a complaint should be launched within six months of the alleged harassment. A decision was pending this week. The Met are also trying to strike out the Lawrences' claim for racism. The difference is that, while Brooks has been offered nothing, the police have already offered Doreen and Neville Lawrence \u00a350,000 compensation each. Brooks argues that the harassment has been on-going, and that he's not interested in a financial settlement, anyway. He wants an apology from the Commissioner, and for the guilty officers to be disciplined or sacked. Brooks has been called racist, anti-white, by officers. \"I said, why would I have a white solicitor if I were racist?\" As suspicious as he is of people he doesn't know, he is steadfast to those who have won his trust. He repeatedly tells me to say how brilliant his lawyers have been over the years - Jane Deighton, Vicky Guedalla, Darren White and Julia Krish. His legal team, he says, has been given no credit, while the newspapers always mention the work done by Imran Khan and Michael Mansfield for the Lawrence family. He points out that it was his legal team who suggested that the Race Relations Act should be expanded to cover the police - probably the most important recommendation to emerge from Macpherson. Perhaps it is as inevitable as it is sad that there should be a split between Brooks and the Lawrences. Doreen Lawrence never approved of her son's friend. One of Duwayne's friends tells me that what has hurt him most over the years was the feeling that the Lawrences partly blame him for what happened to their son. Doreen Lawrence told the inquiry: \"He [Stephen] had been quite strict about being home on time, but after the influence of Duwayne, where Duwayne was allowed to come and go as he pleased, it was different.\" Brooks has taken a lonely road. He has always said he hated the way various race groups tried to exploit the situation; he has always said you should never belong to others. But perhaps it's also true that no one wanted to claim Brooks. Brooks comes out with things that other people might not. He says that when he was younger he used to play for all-black football teams and couldn't stand it. \"Most black boys would prefer to play in a white team because you don't get the arguments, you don't get the selfish behaviour of people thinking they're flash and don't want to pass the football. What managers do these days is they have all white people at the back, and they have black people on the wing and up front because they can run faster; they have white people at the back because they can tackle harder.\" Is he a good footballer? \"Brilliant. If I were fitter, I could play in the Premiership.\" I ask whether Stephen was a good footballer. \"No,\" he says, \"but he was a good runner.\" He stops, aware of the unbearable irony. When he talks about Stephen and their friendship, and the unfairness of it all, the laddishness is replaced by a groping tenderness. \"There was a group of us, and he was the softest person out of all of us - not physically, he was stronger, fitter than me - but his mind was softer. Steve would tolerate a lot of things that other people would lose their patience over.\" It's jolting when he calls him Steve: a reminder that he was a real boy, not just the victim the rest of us came to know. Duwayne was more streetwise than Stephen, and tried to protect him. Just before the fatal attack, he had warned Stephen to run, but his friend couldn't understand why they were in any danger. Brooks has an alarming scar that runs along the back of his neck. How did he get it? He tells me there have been three occasions when he almost died. One was when he was crossing the road, was hit by a car, went through the windscreen and ended up with this scar. The second was when he was swimming in the sea in Jamaica and got trapped under a coral reef. I begin to ask about the third time, and find myself flushed with embarrassment. He offers to drive me to the tube. I tell him not to be daft, it's only a five-minute walk. \"Okay then. I'll ring you to make sure you get back safe.\" And so he does. Many people believe that the decision to prosecute Brooks is related to his civil action against the police. As Darren White says, \"You're going to have much less credibility when you sue the police if you have a sex offence against your name.\" The Movement for Justice claims the Metropolitan police has a vendetta against Brooks and that he has been the victim of a malicious prosecution. When I ask the Met for comment, a spokesman says: \"We take all allegations of crime very seriously, and will investigate all allegations of crime that are put to us.\" Meanwhile a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service says: \"The judge made no specific criticism of the CPS. What criticism that was made was directed at the police.\" But maybe the story goes further back. When Stephen Lawrence died, neither he nor Brooks had a criminal record. The police found this hard to believe. A few months after the murder, Brooks was charged with violent disorder at the Welling demonstration against the British National Party. Even though there were photographs of him with a stick raised and one in which it looked as if he was helping to overturn a car, the judge stayed the case. There were hundreds of people shown in similar pictures, and Brooks was obviously not one of the ringleaders; he was nevertheless one of only a handful of people charged. The judge said that not only was there insufficient evidence against him, not only could it prejudice a case against the killers of Stephen Lawrence, but that Brooks was under such stress he was not accountable for his actions at the time. The police seem to have found the ruling hard to bear. As well as the myriad charges laid against Brooks, and subsequently dropped, since Stephen's death, there have been three convictions for minor offences: cannabis possession; attempt to deceive, for having dodgy driving insurance (would you know if the numbers on your insurance were wrong, asks Brooks); and driving away from a garage without paying (he hadn't realised he had no money, offered to go and get some, the garage attendant wasn't interested, a row ensued and Brooks drove off without paying his \u00a39.60). It's late January 2000, and I am talking to a stunned Darren White, who has just received witness statements from the Crown Prosecution Service concerning the alleged indecent assault. \"I can't believe this case. It will never stand up in court. There is no way this should be going ahead. I've never seen a clearer example of a prosecution that should not go ahead. Call me naive, but I'm shocked.\" So shocked that he can't even be bothered to update me on Sheffield United's disastrous run. One of the recommendations in the Macpherson report held that a lay mediator, a member of the public, should be used to offer victim support in cases where the complainant belongs to an ethnic minority and feels that might prejudice the complainant's relationship with the police. Brooks's case is the first time such a mediator has been used. She has seen the complainant around a dozen times, and is so concerned by the different stories she has heard from her that she goes to the police and tells them that she has grave doubts about the case. The complainant has told the mediator that she didn't think she wanted to press ahead with the charge; she also says that Brooks hadn't assaulted her - that he had just \"sat there\". To add to the confusion, the mediator's statement is unfinished and unsigned, but dated back to November. It is not for another six weeks that the police ask her to sign the statement. She refuses, saying it is inaccurate. The police fail to ask her in what way. By this time, White also has something approximating a chronology of events. On September 4 - the night the young woman made her complaint - she rang the police and said that Brooks had attempted to rape her. By the time the police arrived, she had changed her story, saying that there had been no assault. The police visited her twice over the next week, encouraging her to file a complaint - on each occasion she refused. It is also recorded that DI Sturge said that should the complainant wish to get in touch with him, he was available 24 hours a day. According to White, \"A senior officer showing this level of commitment to a complainant who has made it clear that she doesn't wish to substantiate her allegation is very strange. The police are always complaining how scarce their resources are, and here's DI Sturge on call for 24 hours to a complainant who doesn't want to go to court. What's going on?\" On September 15, following a number of phone calls from Brooks, the complainant called the police and said she wanted him arrested. White is also now aware why Brooks had initially been refused bail. In the custody record, it is written that bail should not be granted because the suspect is likely to \"1) Interfere with witnesses. 2) Commit further offences. The grounds given for this being that, since the time of the offence, the victim has been telephoned by the suspect, where further threats of rape had been made to her, 10 calls being made on the 15th September . . . DI Sturge confirmed that there is a record of these calls to the victim.\" White asked for the record of the phone calls, but the prosecution failed to provide them. When Brooks's legal team finally obtained a record for themselves, it showed that he had made three very short phone calls to the complainant on the 15th before his arrest. Brooks says he rang her to apologise for not giving her a lift home, but that she had put the phone down on him before he could get the words out. The complainant's statement confirms that she put the phone down on him, and there is no mention of threats of rape. It's February, and Brooks is at Woolwich Crown Court, in south-east London, alongside his small but vocal army of supporters. His two sisters, his mother and his grandmother are also there. He doesn't want me to interview his family. Why not? \"Because I don't involve my family in anything that's happening to me.\" Is he close to his family? \"No, I'm not close to anybody, because when they can't get you, they get the next best, and if I'm close to my mum it will be: they can't get Duwayne, let's get his mum; they can't get Duwayne, let's get his sister.\" Does he love them? \" Yes !\" He looks amazed that it could be otherwise. \"I love all my friends and family.\" Members of the anti-racist group, Movement for Justice, are being advised by their leader, Alex Owolade: \"If you see the mediator, we must smile. All we want is for her to tell the truth. And the same with the complainant. You have to show her respect. She's a victim, too.\" I ask him what he means. He says he believes she has been pressurised to continue with the allegation. There are rumours circulating the tiny courtroom: that the complainant has been told she may be given a flat as a protected witness if she testifies; that she may be able to sue for compensation; that she has been told by the police that, if she doesn't testify, she could be arrested. The trial quickly descends into low farce. Brooks's supporters cannot fit in the tiny courtroom, and protest about it. The complainant's mother is due to give evidence, but is on holiday in Florida. The judge is angry, and adjourns the case, stressing that it is because the mother is an important witness. A new date is set in March for the highest criminal court in London, the Old Bailey. As we leave court, Duwayne's grandmother tells him off for not being more chatty. His sisters ask how he could be expected to do his job when he's banned from south London. Brooks says, \"They wanted me to lose my job, to break me down. But they can't take my job away from me, because I am the best worker in that place . And if you ask my boss he'll tell you.\" He's at his arrogant best. \"Listen, when I started at that firm I was working on \u00a360 a week and that firm was in crisis and I got them out of that crisis doing all the hard work.\" He says there is no photocopying machine that he couldn't fix. I ask him whether there is anything he's not good at. \"Big words. I'm bad at big words because I never studied that at school. I've never done verbs and adjectives. I couldn't even tell you what a verb is.\" He says this will not stop him writing his life story. Stephen was the academic one, the boy who was going to be the architect. Duwayne always knew it was important to do well at school, always tried his best, but he could never understand how, when he spent hours poring over his English homework, he would get a worse mark than when he rushed it. Duwayne had already left school when he was attacked. After Stephen was killed, he withdrew from everyone. Just as he was overcoming one shock, there would be another in store. He discovered that a police officer who was protecting him was a friend of the gangster, Clifford Norris, father of one of the suspects, David Norris. Another time he was playing pool in a pub and looked up to discover that the next player was one of the suspected killers of Stephen. He walked out. Does he think he had a breakdown? \"I don't know. As far as I'm concerned, I didn't change. I was just more quiet, didn't really go nowhere.\" Did his friends say he had changed? \"Oh yes. My friends noticed how my attitude changed, how my personality changed, but to me I was just sad.\" At times he was seen walking down the street, lost, muttering to himself about the killers. Since the conditions of his bail were changed and he was allowed to return to London, Brooks has been living with a close friend. He asks me not to name her. She has only known him for two years, but says that the change in him just over that period of time is amazing. \"He's much more confident, outward-going. You see how he talks to me. I told him he had a voice, and he should use it to talk to people, talk about injustice.\" She says it's funny that she has never been in any bother in her life, never had anything bad happen to her, but since Brooks has moved into her house she's had her car broken into twice. \"Maybe people will come for me now.\" Brooks agrees that he has changed, been politicised. He recently went to Northern Ireland and shared a platform with a family campaigning about sectarian killing and RUC neglect. Another day, another court case. This time, we're in one of the most salubrious parts of London, Regent's Park, as the Metropolitan Police argue that Brooks's racism case should be struck out. Outside, a little scene is being played out. A posh elderly woman shouts, \"We're living in a police state, and I'm willing to go to prison for saying so.\" The rasta who has been at every one of Brooks's court appearances quietly ticks her off. \"You not been there, lady, have you? Prison is the worst possible place, you know. They break you in prison.\" The barrister for the Police Federation starts proceedings by saying that whatever points he is going to make, they do not detract from the sympathy he offers to Mr Brooks for all that he has been through. He then launches into the most cynical, legalistic argument for why Brooks is not owed an apology from the police. Brooks sits there with his hands on his chin, stroking the beginnings of a goatee. What's he thinking about? The attack on Stephen and himself has defined his life - in many ways destroyed it, in some ways made it. As he reminds me when he's feeling most chipper: \"Duwayne Brooks's evidence rocked the inquiry, it opened up everybody's eyes. If Duwayne Brooks had decided not to give evidence, not to give police statements, there would have been no investigation into the murder. If Duwayne Brooks had not decided to follow his friend that way, there would have been no suspects.\" The Old Bailey, March. Darren White says that he is going to try and have the sexual assault case thrown out as an abuse of process. He warns me to be prepared for an intense legalistic debate. A month after the defence asked for the updated notes of one of the officers, WPC Chapman, they have still not received them. Eventually, the notes arrive in court and confirm that, when the complainant suggested not going ahead, WPC Chapman met her and told her that, as a fully-bound witness, she could be arrested. We return the next day for more legal argument. Even the prosecutor agrees that there have been \"disastrous\" errors by the police. Brooks says that he is not worried about going to jail because, in the end, he knows the truth will come out. His friend tells me that the previous night he couldn't sleep. Soon after noon, the judge says he will retire to consider whether there has been an abuse of process. Over lunch, Brooks is quiet, reflective. Out of nowhere he starts talking about a docu-drama concerning the killing of Stephen that was on television a few years ago.\"They por-trayed us as rude boys, ragamuffins. I was so annoyed about that, boy, was I annoyed. They used the word ragamuffin. Ragamuffin ! He picks up my Guardian and reads a piece about the racist killing of Michael Menson. \"'Police initially thought he had set fire to himself, but later decided that he had been the victim of a racially motivated attack.' That is wrong, they didn't decide. It should say they were forced to, after persistence of family and friends.\" It's 2pm, and we're called back into court. The judge says that the use of the mediator has been disastrous, that the police failed to brief her as to her role, and that then, when she did make her statement, they waited six weeks before asking her to sign it. \"This delay is even more baffling . . . or worrying,\" he says. The prosecution, he says, has caused this situation with \"a series of errors and misjudgments. Bearing in mind the conflicts and inconsistencies, it would be unfair to try Mr Brooks, therefore I will stay the proceedings.\" Outside the Old Bailey, Duwayne Brooks is wearing a huge smile. He makes a brief statement and dances down the street for the camera, arm in arm with his sister, Millie. \"My little brother. You've got your life back again brother,\" she says as she buries her face in his chest. \"We've only just begun,\" says Brooks. His friends are ecstatic, looking forward to tomorrow's headlines. In the event, Brooks is knocked off the front pages. Actually, many papers don't even report the case. It's not surprising that the Budget took precedence, but amazingly, on the very day Brooks is acquitted, the police announce that they have arrested three new suspects in the Stephen Lawrence case. The next day Brooks rings me. I ask whether he's been celebrating, and he mumbles an answer. He sounds upset. \"You know the girl I've been staying with. Last night, her car was set on fire.\"",

      "body": "<p>We don't really like our rock stars to age. Should they be allowed, at 56 years of age, to wear leather trousers and persist in performing? As a rule, we prefer to think of them as they were in those early moments, when they first started to seep into our psyches. When Roxy Music appeared on Top Of The Pops in 1972, they seemed freakishly exciting and grown-up, with their futuristic rockabilly look. As the poised Bryan Ferry launched into the trilling, peculiarly hypnotic strains of their first single, Virginia Plain, it felt as if they had crashlanded into a landscape previously populated by lumpen Osmond brothers and over-sequined glam rockers.</p> <p>Roxy Music were pure, distilled glamour. Through the 70s and early 80s, they reigned supreme, with hit after glorious hit, and, with the blonde and glossy Jerry Hall on his arm, Ferry became an icon of urbane cool and affluent sophistication. Roxy revamped the idioms and attitudes of popular music with their weird concoctions of oboe and synthesiser, their arrogant bravado, their visual flair, and their singer's half-drawled snarls and warbles.</p> <p>So it comes as no great surprise that Ferry is such a picture of impeccable composure this evening in Amsterdam. It's only to be expected that he should saunter, unruffled, out of his dressing room, and - flanked by two staff - stride coolly down the backstage corridor that will take him to the stage and his expectant audience. Ferry doesn't do flustered. He is known, after all, as the master lounge lizard. Although he has written and produced some of the most innovative and exciting music of his time, the popular perception of Ferry is still invariably linked with one or other of his languorously elegant images.</p> <p>On the afternoon before the Amsterdam concert, the floppy-haired, slightly craggy Ferry sits sipping sparkling water, and speaks quietly in a voice that wavers between plummy English gent and lilting Geordie. He is as you would imagine he would be - tall, handsome, elegant in his tweed jacket (\"Savile Row\") and cords.</p> <p>Ferry has attained heights of sophistication so at odds with his upbringing as to seem improbable. Home was in a tiny, impoverished pit-village called Washington, near Durham; his father was a farmer and sometime pit-worker. Bryan was listening to music at five years old, and \"obsessive\" by the age of 10 or 11, ever since his Aunt Enid and her husband had met some GIs in Gibraltar, and returned home with a suitcase full of jazz records. As a boy, Bryan had a newspaper round, and he would read the music papers as he walked down the street.</p> <p>He knew early on that he wanted to escape, that he didn't quite fit in. \"I'm not sure if cuckoo's the right word,\" he muses, gazing absently out of the window, \"but I remember feeling like I wanted to expand, go to New York, or go to London initially, which is pretty normal . . . for people to gravitate towards their capital city if they're ambitious.\" As a teenager, he travelled every Saturday to Newcastle, where he had a job in a tailor's shop. He used to love it when the teddy boys strolled into the shop. He would look on admiringly as they strutted like peacocks in their velvet-collared jackets. He saved his wages to buy winklepickers and Italian suits - and jazz music.</p> <p>He admits freely that, for the purposes of the most recent album, As Time Goes By - a collection of 30s standards, many of which feature on the current tour - he borrowed from the style and phrasing of Billie Holiday in her 30s period, and her arranger Teddy Wilson. One of the first records he remembers buying was an EP by the Charlie Parker Quintet with Miles Davis. On As Time Goes By, he returns to the likes of Cole Porter's You Do Something To Me and Miss Otis Regrets, and Kahn and Donaldson's Love Me Or Leave Me. It is not the first time that Ferry has revisited the songs of his youth and long before - they also featured on earlier albums such as These Foolish Things, Another Time, Another Place and Taxi. The songs on this latest album are not all melancholic, but many are, and most are love songs. It seems appropriate Ferry territory. The sweeping anguish and grand romanticism of earlier songs such as Carrickfergus, Dance Away and Over You have always suggested something of the doomed romantic about Ferry. \"Most of the great songs are love songs, it's as simple as that. Whether I'm that romantic, I don't know - as much as a northern boy can be,\" he laughs.</p> <p>His childhood wasn't hard, he insists. \"It depends how spoilt you are now. We didn't have a car or a telephone or a fridge, we lived in a Coronation Street-type terraced house, and went to the local school. I worked in all the holidays to make money. We always felt poor, I guess, but I was never deprived of anything. I just had to go out and work for the extra things.\" He loved Newcastle. He remembers a mod clothing shop called City Stylish, one of his favourites. \"Newcastle was a mod stronghold, really.\" When he goes there now, all of these memories come back to him, he says. He still feels a closeness to the north. \"The light you get up there is quite clear and hard and crisp,\" he says, gazing into the distance. Would he move back? \"I wouldn't mind living on the Borders. I don't know if I ever will, but when I go up there I do think, 'God's own country'.\"</p> <p>After jazz, Hendrix was his next love, and then, when studying fine art at Newcastle University, he favoured the \"more esoteric art music\" of John Cage and his ilk, \"but only up to a point\". The look of things was always crucial. Ferry was taught by Pop artist Richard Hamilton at art college, and it was his influence that spawned the \"cover girl\" look of the Roxy album sleeves. \"To go that route seemed the only option,\" he says. \"I mean, we could've had a picture of the band, looking rather glum, which was normal, standing on a cobbled street or something. But I didn't fancy that. The pin-up was a great way to sell things traditionally, whether it was a Cadillac or a Coke bottle or a packet of cigarettes.\"</p> <p>It's easy to forget that rock was a rather austere domain in the early 70s. Roxy's album sleeves were in a league of their own, and there was always an element of pastiche about the aesthetic: from the Betty Grable-style shot that adorned their first, eponymous album onwards, they introduced a new, semi-ironic glossiness to rock music. Designer Antony Price helped with the styling, and every element, from the photography to the typeface, was planned in meticulous detail. The style was much imitated in ensuing years, and the covers still possess an iconic quality. \"I'm quite proud of that, really,\" says Ferry, \"because I never got a chance to do anything else, visually. I chose not to paint any more after I started to do records.\"</p> <p>The look hovered somewhere between sophisticated lingerie advertising and softcore pornography, and the album Country Life - which featured on its cover models in their knickers, posing as socialites caught in the headlights of a car, as if in the midst of some wild country-house party - was banned in the US. Ferry took any objections to the cover-girl sleeves in his stride. \"It wasn't a case of putting anyone down,\" he says evenly. \"They were kind of tributes. A celebration of female glamour, if you like. They weren't done with any bad feeling at all.\"</p> <p>The mermaid with the killer fingernails and the come-hither expression on the cover of the 1975 album Siren was Jerry Hall, hired by Ferry. She soon moved into his Los Angeles mansion - she was 18 and he was 30 - and for two years they were a most dazzling item. She even performed the memorable, high-pitched yelps on the classic Let's Stick Together of 1976. It was Ferry, so the story goes, who introduced her to his friend Mick Jagger. Nothing happened until Ferry went on tour to Japan and Australia, declaring - Hall later claimed - that he would not be calling her because it was too expensive. She was furious (\"I mean, he was a rock star!\" she later commented), and went to New York where she came across both Jagger and Warren Beatty at a dinner party. Both men were interested in the statuesque Texan blonde, but it was Jagger who took her home. \"That was it,\" she said later. \"I behaved very badly. No excuse.\"</p> <p>What with Roxy's growing success in the States allowing for an increasingly glossy lifestyle, fantasy and reality began to blur for Ferry, not least during the Jerry Hall phase - he, the dashing, white- tuxedoed lounge lizard; she, the goddess-like \u00fcbermodel. By the end of the 70s, with the release of Roxy album number six, Manifesto, the intended irony of the Roxy sensibility was beginning to fade. The New Musical Express took to calling him Byron Ferrari.</p> <p>He already owned a country pile in picturesque West Sussex, and when he married society gel Lucy Helmore in 1982, it was all too much for some commentators, who branded him a fake country gent and an arriviste. Much was made of the difference in backgrounds of the couple, but, he points out, she wasn't the first person he'd met from a different class. There are differences, of course, he says. North, south. She went to boarding school, he didn't. He went to university, she didn't. She is 14 years his junior. \"But she's not an heiress, as was often claimed, with a stately home,\" he says. \"Not a sausage,\" he adds with a laugh.</p> <p>The couple have four boys, and the eldest, Otis, now lives in Ireland where he works for a horse dealer. \"Which is funny, because that's what my dad always liked. He grew up on a farm, and during the depression the farm failed and he had to go and look after the horses underground in the pit. He worked with horses all his life, and then last year, with Otis, horses have taken over.\" Lucy also loves riding. And she \"takes very good photographs, which people don't know\". He likes the countryside, and \"wearing tweed jackets\", but he's fond of the city too, which is just as well, he says, since he's there five out of every seven days.</p> <p>His wife doesn't much like being written about, he tells me, which is not so surprising. He has, in the past, referred to the marriage as \"turbulent\", and in interviews described her as \"a Virgo . . . not easy\", and as \"Garbo-esque\". In 1993, she revealed that she had been admitted to a rehab clinic to be treated for drink and drug dependency, and Ferry admitted at the time that he was prone to depression. An obsessive career in music has its drawbacks: \"The other side of your life suffers, that's for sure, but I'm not crying about it.\" His marriage has survived. \"We've managed to keep it together all this time,\" he says with a smile.</p> <p>The Ferry aesthetic is rather more subdued these days than at its height of febrile Roxy sensuality, and has been for a number of years. He chose an image of a horse for the sleeve of his 1994 album Mamouna. \"That went down like a lead balloon,\" he laughs. It must, after all, have been rather wearing, being so mercilessly cutting-edge in the 70s and early 80s; that high-octane, highly-sexed sensibility, you would imagine, might wear thin in middle age. Is this new, nostalgic preoccupation a kind of backlash, I wonder, against the unrelenting edginess and modernity of the Roxy days. \"Yes,\" he agrees. \"Or a backwater . . . a salmon pool,\" he chuckles. He's particularly pleased with his orchestra, which includes a classically-trained brass section as well as the strings. \"As soon as you start having strings, you stop calling it a band. They're not used to this kind of rock'n'roll touring, which means they're not jaded old session players, so it feels very fresh. There are no guitars thrashing about or anything like that - it's more subdued, more intimate.\" There are three tour buses, and Ferry, I'm told, prefers to travel on the bus with the all-female string quartet (along with his wardrobe master and the sound director, Ferry's old friend and Avalon producer, Rhett Davies). It's the no-smoking bus. All very civilised.</p> <p>Ferry also seems rather to relish the freedom from fashion that comes with the old standards territory, though he is still a fan of some contemporary music - Beck, Radiohead, Missy Eliot, Macy Gray, Massive Attack, Tricky. \"But I don't hear much that blows me away. This record is different from all that, and that's why I'm pleased that it's done well, because it's not for MTV. There isn't even a video. It just exists like an old gramophone record.\" He draws a comparison with the recent, hugely successful Buena Vista Social Club album. \"It's very refreshing that a record that's against the time can do so well.\"</p> <p>All in all, he seems to be rather enjoying this more mellow phase of his career. Making the album was \"really angst-free, which was a real change for me with record making. I put a lot into it, and as a rule it can be quite traumatic, but with this it was as if I'd been waiting to do it for many years and suddenly it all came rushing out.\" In the past, his voice has been buried in the mix, but now the approach is different: \"The songs are so strong that just to sing them like a conventional singer felt very new to me.\" The record has done pretty well, considering the low-key approach, selling 500,000 copies worldwide, and although stadium gigs are a thing of the past the new European tour has been a sell-out.</p> <p>He spends his money, he says, on \"decorating\" his life - \"having things around you that you like to look at\", and collects art from the first half of the last century, particularly the Bloomsbury artists. \"Not really great art, but decorative, cosy to live with.\" He has no plans to leave England, though the idea of a warm climate does appeal, he says, citing No\u00ebl Coward and Ian Fleming and their elegant, Caribbean idylls.</p> <p>The self-made glamour of Ferry's persona and the romantic despair that undertows much of his music have led to comparisons with that well-known figure of fatal elegance, Gatsby, a victim of his own aspiration who kept others at a distance with his affluence. \"I've been compared to Dracula as well,\" he responds, with a loud, throaty laugh. He doesn't seem too averse to the Gatsby notion, though; he is a fan of Fitzgerald, along with Waugh, \"very stylish writers\". \"He's a romantic figure, old Gatsby, isn't he - a sad, lost, lonely figure. . .\" he smiles. \"I always identified with the blues and sad songs that seemed to be deep and mean something, you know, rather than a jingle on a Cornflakes ad. But there's lots of jolly music, too: Do The Strand - that's a lark, one of my best songs. But the bulk of them do tend to be introverted and introspective and doom and gloom.\" He pauses and gazes out of the window. \"My mother was a very emotional person. So am I.\" Not exactly prone to melancholy, he says, but \"soft-hearted, she always cried at things that upset her, any kind of cruelty. Tender hearted. She wasn't a hard woman. The opposite.\"</p> <p>From 1976, his parents lived until the end of their lives in a cottage on the grounds of his estate in Sussex; his father died in 1984, his mother in 1991. Their deaths shook Ferry, and his sons felt their absence, too. He says that he has \"tried to make a normal life\" in order to balance his obsession with music, and doesn't think that fame and success have changed him fundamentally. \"You tend to feel the same as when you were a teenager - you don't really change that much. You have different concerns, different worries. You have a family, and that multiplies all the things you have to think about. Certainly since 1982, when I started having a family, I've tried to have a sense of normality in my life, because the rest of it can be a bit bizarre. My children are very important to me, very high on my priority list - but then, so is my work. I've always put so much into my work. It's great that I still have an audience who appreciates it.\" Is he happy? \"Well, it's not a word I bandy around so much . . .\" he says, and stares into the distance, looking neither quite happy nor quite unhappy. Later this year there will be a \"rock album\", which he has been working on with Rhett Davies and Roxy Music founder member Brian Eno. It's not quite a Roxy reunion, but a tour is not out of the question.</p> <p>On stage that evening at the elegant, classical venue Concert Gebouw, Ferry sweeps through the old standards with aplomb. The show is polished and beautifully crafted; his voice is mesmerising. A mirrorball rotates, casting luminous snowflakes around the auditorium as he launches, light and whimsical, into Just One Of Those Things; his version of the Dietrich classic Falling in Love Again is peculiarly intense and plaintive. It is a perfect set for the rock star growing old gracefully.</p> <p>Which is, presumably, the whole idea. Ferry, the art-school graduate, has always known how to put together a persona. He and his fantasy world have always been on intimate terms, so it must come easily to him now - to construct an image (the mature, sophisticated crooner beyond fashion) and then to inhabit it with great assurance and equanimity. So, at 54, he still gets to wear the leather trousers, but with a dinner jacket - a combination that he carries off with a languorous, long-legged charm. If there was a time when he felt trapped in his own Gatsbyesque world, his private life the victim of his aspirations, then it seems that time has passed. For all his self-mythologising, Ferry has a rather appealing self-awareness about him. The cover of As Time Goes By is adorned with elegant, demure fashion illustrations from the 1930s. He dislikes using images of himself these days, he says, \"because you can never find enough glamorous photographs of yourself. And that's worrying if you're vain,\" he adds, laughing. \"As the years go by, you feel the same inside but you look slightly different.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Bryan Ferry plays the Royal Albert Hall, London, on April 11.

There are no guitars thrashing about or anything like that - it's more subdued, more intimate.\" There are three tour buses, and Ferry, I'm told, prefers to travel on the bus with the all-female string quartet (along with his wardrobe master and the sound director, Ferry's old friend and Avalon producer, Rhett Davies). It's the no-smoking bus. All very civilised. Ferry also seems rather to relish the freedom from fashion that comes with the old standards territory, though he is still a fan of some contemporary music - Beck, Radiohead, Missy Eliot, Macy Gray, Massive Attack, Tricky. \"But I don't hear much that blows me away. This record is different from all that, and that's why I'm pleased that it's done well, because it's not for MTV. There isn't even a video. It just exists like an old gramophone record.\" He draws a comparison with the recent, hugely successful Buena Vista Social Club album. \"It's very refreshing that a record that's against the time can do so well.\" All in all, he seems to be rather enjoying this more mellow phase of his career. Making the album was \"really angst-free, which was a real change for me with record making. I put a lot into it, and as a rule it can be quite traumatic, but with this it was as if I'd been waiting to do it for many years and suddenly it all came rushing out.\" In the past, his voice has been buried in the mix, but now the approach is different: \"The songs are so strong that just to sing them like a conventional singer felt very new to me.\" The record has done pretty well, considering the low-key approach, selling 500,000 copies worldwide, and although stadium gigs are a thing of the past the new European tour has been a sell-out. He spends his money, he says, on \"decorating\" his life - \"having things around you that you like to look at\", and collects art from the first half of the last century, particularly the Bloomsbury artists. \"Not really great art, but decorative, cosy to live with.\" He has no plans to leave England, though the idea of a warm climate does appeal, he says, citing No\u00ebl Coward and Ian Fleming and their elegant, Caribbean idylls. The self-made glamour of Ferry's persona and the romantic despair that undertows much of his music have led to comparisons with that well-known figure of fatal elegance, Gatsby, a victim of his own aspiration who kept others at a distance with his affluence. \"I've been compared to Dracula as well,\" he responds, with a loud, throaty laugh. He doesn't seem too averse to the Gatsby notion, though; he is a fan of Fitzgerald, along with Waugh, \"very stylish writers\". \"He's a romantic figure, old Gatsby, isn't he - a sad, lost, lonely figure. . .\" he smiles. \"I always identified with the blues and sad songs that seemed to be deep and mean something, you know, rather than a jingle on a Cornflakes ad. But there's lots of jolly music, too: Do The Strand - that's a lark, one of my best songs. But the bulk of them do tend to be introverted and introspective and doom and gloom.\" He pauses and gazes out of the window. \"My mother was a very emotional person. So am I.\" Not exactly prone to melancholy, he says, but \"soft-hearted, she always cried at things that upset her, any kind of cruelty. Tender hearted. She wasn't a hard woman. The opposite.\" From 1976, his parents lived until the end of their lives in a cottage on the grounds of his estate in Sussex; his father died in 1984, his mother in 1991. Their deaths shook Ferry, and his sons felt their absence, too. He says that he has \"tried to make a normal life\" in order to balance his obsession with music, and doesn't think that fame and success have changed him fundamentally. \"You tend to feel the same as when you were a teenager - you don't really change that much. You have different concerns, different worries. You have a family, and that multiplies all the things you have to think about. Certainly since 1982, when I started having a family, I've tried to have a sense of normality in my life, because the rest of it can be a bit bizarre. My children are very important to me, very high on my priority list - but then, so is my work. I've always put so much into my work. It's great that I still have an audience who appreciates it.\" Is he happy? \"Well, it's not a word I bandy around so much . . .\" he says, and stares into the distance, looking neither quite happy nor quite unhappy. Later this year there will be a \"rock album\", which he has been working on with Rhett Davies and Roxy Music founder member Brian Eno. It's not quite a Roxy reunion, but a tour is not out of the question. On stage that evening at the elegant, classical venue Concert Gebouw, Ferry sweeps through the old standards with aplomb. The show is polished and beautifully crafted; his voice is mesmerising. A mirrorball rotates, casting luminous snowflakes around the auditorium as he launches, light and whimsical, into Just One Of Those Things; his version of the Dietrich classic Falling in Love Again is peculiarly intense and plaintive. It is a perfect set for the rock star growing old gracefully. Which is, presumably, the whole idea. Ferry, the art-school graduate, has always known how to put together a persona. He and his fantasy world have always been on intimate terms, so it must come easily to him now - to construct an image (the mature, sophisticated crooner beyond fashion) and then to inhabit it with great assurance and equanimity. So, at 54, he still gets to wear the leather trousers, but with a dinner jacket - a combination that he carries off with a languorous, long-legged charm. If there was a time when he felt trapped in his own Gatsbyesque world, his private life the victim of his aspirations, then it seems that time has passed. For all his self-mythologising, Ferry has a rather appealing self-awareness about him. The cover of As Time Goes By is adorned with elegant, demure fashion illustrations from the 1930s. He dislikes using images of himself these days, he says, \"because you can never find enough glamorous photographs of yourself. And that's worrying if you're vain,\" he adds, laughing. \"As the years go by, you feel the same inside but you look slightly different.\" \u0095 Bryan Ferry plays the Royal Albert Hall, London, on April 11. As Time Goes By is out on Virgin Records.",

      "body": "<p>At the time, I thought it was just coincidence, but now I see that we must have set each other off. What else but dormant sibling rivalry - the desire not to be outdone, or simply left behind - could have prompted this collective impulse towards parenthood? When giving the news of my pregnancy to friends, I tried to be nonchalant about the fact that both my sisters were in the same situation. That the three of us - all in our 30s, living in different cities and, in my case, in a different continent - had taken it into our heads to have babies within the same year. But it was impossible. In the end, I resorted to a single statement. \"The Unsworths,\" I took to announcing, rather grandly, \"are spawning.\"</p> <p>Up until this point, our reproductive tally had been meagre in the extreme. Ten years before, my older sister, Madeleine, had given birth to Felix, who for a whole decade had enjoyed the kind of status afforded to an endangered baby panda in London Zoo. His every movement was tracked and marvelled over by a gaggle of grandparents, aunts and uncles. One Easter Sunday in the early 90s, no fewer than eight adults trailed his unsteady progress during an egg hunt, watching as he filled his basket with more chocolate than half-a-dozen children could possibly eat in a week. Now, in the space of a few months, his long reign was about to come to an abrupt end.</p> <p>Our mother was in a daze. She seemed to oscillate between pleasure and a piercing fear for our collective health. As though the sudden wealth of grandchildren to come had become muddled in her mind. Not three daughters having separate babies, but one child having three at once. After her fervent wish that we would all make it through labour alive, she wanted at least one of us to have a girl. I was certain it would be me.</p> <p>We all became pregnant in ways that now seem typical of our characters. My big sister first, of course. She had always done everything first. And, true to form, it was difficult. There was more than a year of trying to conceive, during which time she suffered the frightening indignities of a lost IUD, an emergency operation to remove a polyp and her GP casually (or so it seemed) telling her that it might be too late since she was probably going through early menopause.</p> <p>At some stage during this process, I decided that I, too, was ready for motherhood. I was perfectly sure that all it would take was for me to throw away my pills and have sex a couple of times. Mentally, I rehearsed what I would say to my older sister when I gave her the news. I would have to be very gentle, since she would still be struggling to get pregnant. I thought that perhaps I could offer - sometime down the line - to be a surrogate mother for her. I was quite taken with the nobleness of this gesture.</p> <p>During the first few months of trying to conceive my own child, I would imagine what it would like to be pregnant with my sister's. I had got to the part where I, with a tearful - but ineffably brave - smile, was on the point of handing the newborn into her arms when she gave me the startling news that she had become pregnant all by herself.</p> <p>I was overjoyed, and then I was overcome by panic. If she could do it, why couldn't I? For the next five months, I tormented anyone who would listen with my fears that there was something wrong with me. Each time I called my family from my home in Boston, US, there would be a short expectant pause before I gave the news that nothing had happened yet, and that no, they shouldn't worry, because I felt all right about it. Really all right. I went to the UK for a visit, and my big sister took me to Boots to buy an ovulation predictor kit. As we walked back, I frantically ripped open the wrapper to read the instructions. \"I know lots of people who've used them,\" she said. \"They do work, I promise.\" I could tell that she felt bad for me. I didn't want her to feel guilty, but I knew she did.</p> <p>And then, when she was seven months pregnant, it happened. With the test still in my hand, I dialled both my sisters to give them the news. Three days later, Maddy called me back. \"I don't know how to tell you this,\" she said, \"you must think it's funny coming from me . . .\" My little sister, Thomasina, was pregnant, too. She had conceived two weeks earlier than me. Quickly and quietly, keeping the news a secret, not wanting to upset me, and then, when she heard I was pregnant, not wanting to steal my thunder. She was always kind. The sweet sister. I know she disliked this label and felt typecast by it, but it was true.</p> <p>\"How long were you going to keep it from me?\" I asked her.</p> <p>\"I just don't know,\" she said helplessly. \"For as long as possible, I suppose.\"</p> <p>\"I didn't even know you were trying.\" It struck me how very secretive she was. How there had always been things I didn't know about her. \"It would have been spoiled if you hadn't got pregnant, too,\" she said. \"What do you think you're having?\"</p> <p>\"Probably a boy,\" I said, feeling convinced I was carrying a girl. I put my hands on my stomach in the way that newly pregnant women do. With a kind of hesitant, fearful wonder. Each time I did it, it seemed I was touching my sisters' unborn children along with my own. It made me think of Christmas Eve. Of the three of us as children, hanging up our stockings, waiting for a transformation no less miraculous for all its inevitability. The same sense then, as now, of all being in it together, our excitement feeding off each other, our hopes inseparable.</p> <p>\"Are you frightened?\" my little sister asked. I told her I was going to ask for painkillers as soon as labour began. Before it began. She said she was going to try yoga and breathing techniques. Maddy and I were sceptical about this approach. It was not that we thought natural childbirth was sure to fail. Just the opposite. If Tom was going to be able to get through labour armed with nothing more than a zen-like attitude and a couple of visualisation exercises, it would make the pair of us look like whining junkies, shrieking for our gas and air and lovely - oh how lovely - epidurals.</p> <p>But, by this stage, Maddy was beyond caring how much labour might hurt. She just wanted the baby out. Every day, she said, she would waddle down to the bakery around the corner from her house. Sticky buns had become her only joy in life. Between ourselves, Thomasina and I tutted at the weight she must be putting on. Still svelte from throwing up every other day, we decided we would not gain more than one pound a week throughout our pregnancies. As soon as our babies were born, we would start a strict regimen of exercise to get rid of what small amount of flab we might have accumulated.</p> <p>A few weeks later, after a short but fierce labour, Jack was born. Maddy sent me a photograph taken minutes after the birth. The picture was slightly out of focus. I thought it captured how she must have felt at that moment. Bleary with relief and pride, unsure around her edges. \"Jack has the most peculiar face,\" Maddy told me over the phone. \"He's not exactly a looker.\" It was always her style to downplay momentous events. Self-denigrating quips were a speciality of hers.</p> <p>Thomasina, on the other hand, seemed to be revelling in the drama of pregnancy. On a trip back home for a friend's wedding, I noticed that she could barely go five minutes without stroking her stomach. Maddy and I watched her on the dancefloor, spinning dreamily, one hand resting on her bulge. \"Why does she have to keep drawing attention to it?\" I asked. I tried to dance as though being pregnant was a complete irrelevance, swinging my arms briskly, blithely ignoring the fact that I couldn't quite see what my feet were doing. I must have looked completely ridiculous.</p> <p>Thomasina had decided she wouldn't find out her baby's gender before it was born, but I needed to know as early as possible. I had started fingering tiny dresses in shops and wanted to decide on a name for my girl. I could already see her in my mind's eye. Brown eyes, blonde curly hair, an ethereal air to her.</p> <p>The ultrasound technician had an unfeasibly loud voice. \"You're having a boy!\" he bellowed as he swept the paddle across my stomach. He laughed heartily. \"Look at him kick. A real football player!\" On the way home in the car, I wept from confusion and defeated expectation. \"He'll be lovely,\" my little sister told me over the phone.</p> <p>\"But he's going to be a jock,\" I protested.</p> <p>\"You'll love him. I know you will.\"</p> <p>She came to visit me in Boston when we were both six months pregnant. It was late summer and we sat on the beach in our maternity swimsuits, stomachs pointing towards the ocean. We talked about our older sister, still submerged in the semi-purdah of early motherhood. Jack was colicky, and Maddy had struggled through a bout of mastitis. She seemed to be teetering on the verge of bad post-natal depression. But in the sunshine, half-hypnotised by the sound of the surf, these problems seemed far away. We would have calm babies, we told each other, because we would be calm mothers. We would carry our babies around in slings everywhere we went. Maddy was always so tense about everything, we agreed. She had never learned how to relax.</p> <p>The truth was that we didn't want to think about the realities of parenthood. We wanted, I think, for that one day, to be contained forever in our pregnancy. In that small, still place between the revolutions of conception and birth. Sitting there, Thomasina said, with both of us pregnant, made her think of our childhood. \"Do you think the cousins will play on the beach together like we did?\" she asked. I thought they would. At that moment it seemed easy to think that our lives would continue endlessly parallel, that there was a pattern that would keep us always together. But underneath I knew that this was perhaps the last time I would think like this. Birth had drawn us together, and soon it would scatter us. Changing us all in ways we couldn't yet imagine, giving us new patterns of allegiance.</p> <p>We went and ate hamburgers at a restaurant on the beach. The plan to keep our weight under control had been completely abandoned. \"I have cellulite on my ankles,\" my little sister said as she crammed onion rings into her mouth. \"I mean, is that even possible?\"</p> <p>Back at the house, we called Maddy. She sounded busy and very cross. She knew we had been talking about her. Later, she told me it had been difficult for her to think of us together with our stomachs still round while hers was empty and saggy. She felt out of the club. She wondered whether, after all, we'd find birth and early motherhood easier than she had done, and that this would be proof that she really was no good at it. We would not understand what she had been complaining about. We'd be better organised, better mothers. Over the phone, we told her about the trendy boot-cut leggings that we had bought at Guess. \"I hope they've got strong elastic in the waistband,\" she said rather bitterly.</p> <p>Thomasina went home and we called each other almost every day to compare notes and discuss what a Braxton Hicks contraction might feel like and whether Body Shop cocoa butter was really any good for stretch marks. I had started to feel heavy and uncomfortable and wretched with back ache, but during the conversations with my sister it was still possible to imagine that the whole thing was something of a lark. A kind of game that could end whenever we decided to stop playing.</p> <p>Thomasina went past her due date and we continued to talk as though we might be pregnant forever. Then she called me to tell me she was in labour. She was in hospital, in bed, talking to me from the telephone on the ward. It was really happening. \"What's it like?\" I said. \"Tell me everything.\"</p> <p>\"It doesn't hurt. Honestly. It doesn't. It's fine.\" She gave a little gasp as she said this and put the phone down shortly after. Poor Thomasina. She was still being kind. She couldn't bring herself to tell me the truth. That the yoga had failed, her epidural hadn't taken, her cervix had refused to dilate and doctors were muttering about doing a caesarean. Much later, she confessed that on a pain scale of one to 10, with one being a mild headache and 10 being tortured by the Gestapo all night, it scored an easy 15. Isobel was born in the early hours of the morning and suddenly, I was all alone. The last egg left in the box. Down the phone I heard the thin cries of the newborn.</p> <p>\"Trust you to get the girl,\" I said.</p> <p>\"We're all waiting on you now,\" she said.</p> <p>My labour, 10 days later, was almost as easy as it gets. My doctor told me it was a textbook case. A swift dilation, a timely epidural. I was watching CHiPs on the television and marvelling how I ever fancied Erik Estrada when the doctor told me I could start to push. My husband, geared up for fear and torment, stood about feeling redundant, a paper cup of unwanted ice-chips in his hand. I called Thomasina from the phone by the bed, listening to it ring thousands of miles away and wondering at the strangeness of the world.</p> <p>\"I'm doing it!\" I said. \"I'm watching CHiPs and having a baby.\"</p> <p>\"You don't have to be brave,\" she said. \"If it's bad, you don't have to be brave with me. Just hang in there. We're all thinking of you.\"</p> <p>\"It isn't bad! Was it like this for you?\"</p> <p>She muttered something I couldn't hear.</p> <p>\"I'll call you again when he's born,\" I said merrily. \"It shouldn't be long now.\"</p> <p>We will never all be pregnant at the same time again. Maddy is not having any more children. Thomasina and I have not made up our minds when, or if, we'll add to our families. But I like to think that the babies the three of us produced in a single year will be closer than mere cousins. Jack, Isobel and Oscar. The names go well together. Last month, during a trip back home, we sat in a room and watched our children with a feeling close to astonishment. We three had become six.</p> <p>It seemed a kind of miracle.</p> <p>None of the babies looks like each other. You wouldn't be able to tell they are related. Jack is big and bold and naughty looking, Isobel blonde and smiley, Oscar is small with dark hair and skin. But we can see similarities. One has Maddy's dimple, another has my eyes, a third the long line of Thomasina's cheek. When we look at our children, we see our sisters there.</p>",

She had never learned how to relax. The truth was that we didn't want to think about the realities of parenthood. We wanted, I think, for that one day, to be contained forever in our pregnancy. In that small, still place between the revolutions of conception and birth. Sitting there, Thomasina said, with both of us pregnant, made her think of our childhood. \"Do you think the cousins will play on the beach together like we did?\" she asked. I thought they would. At that moment it seemed easy to think that our lives would continue endlessly parallel, that there was a pattern that would keep us always together. But underneath I knew that this was perhaps the last time I would think like this. Birth had drawn us together, and soon it would scatter us. Changing us all in ways we couldn't yet imagine, giving us new patterns of allegiance. We went and ate hamburgers at a restaurant on the beach. The plan to keep our weight under control had been completely abandoned. \"I have cellulite on my ankles,\" my little sister said as she crammed onion rings into her mouth. \"I mean, is that even possible?\" Back at the house, we called Maddy. She sounded busy and very cross. She knew we had been talking about her. Later, she told me it had been difficult for her to think of us together with our stomachs still round while hers was empty and saggy. She felt out of the club. She wondered whether, after all, we'd find birth and early motherhood easier than she had done, and that this would be proof that she really was no good at it. We would not understand what she had been complaining about. We'd be better organised, better mothers. Over the phone, we told her about the trendy boot-cut leggings that we had bought at Guess. \"I hope they've got strong elastic in the waistband,\" she said rather bitterly. Thomasina went home and we called each other almost every day to compare notes and discuss what a Braxton Hicks contraction might feel like and whether Body Shop cocoa butter was really any good for stretch marks. I had started to feel heavy and uncomfortable and wretched with back ache, but during the conversations with my sister it was still possible to imagine that the whole thing was something of a lark. A kind of game that could end whenever we decided to stop playing. Thomasina went past her due date and we continued to talk as though we might be pregnant forever. Then she called me to tell me she was in labour. She was in hospital, in bed, talking to me from the telephone on the ward. It was really happening. \"What's it like?\" I said. \"Tell me everything.\" \"It doesn't hurt. Honestly. It doesn't. It's fine.\" She gave a little gasp as she said this and put the phone down shortly after. Poor Thomasina. She was still being kind. She couldn't bring herself to tell me the truth. That the yoga had failed, her epidural hadn't taken, her cervix had refused to dilate and doctors were muttering about doing a caesarean. Much later, she confessed that on a pain scale of one to 10, with one being a mild headache and 10 being tortured by the Gestapo all night, it scored an easy 15. Isobel was born in the early hours of the morning and suddenly, I was all alone. The last egg left in the box. Down the phone I heard the thin cries of the newborn. \"Trust you to get the girl,\" I said. \"We're all waiting on you now,\" she said. My labour, 10 days later, was almost as easy as it gets. My doctor told me it was a textbook case. A swift dilation, a timely epidural. I was watching CHiPs on the television and marvelling how I ever fancied Erik Estrada when the doctor told me I could start to push. My husband, geared up for fear and torment, stood about feeling redundant, a paper cup of unwanted ice-chips in his hand. I called Thomasina from the phone by the bed, listening to it ring thousands of miles away and wondering at the strangeness of the world. \"I'm doing it!\" I said. \"I'm watching CHiPs and having a baby.\" \"You don't have to be brave,\" she said. \"If it's bad, you don't have to be brave with me. Just hang in there. We're all thinking of you.\" \"It isn't bad! Was it like this for you?\" She muttered something I couldn't hear. \"I'll call you again when he's born,\" I said merrily. \"It shouldn't be long now.\" We will never all be pregnant at the same time again. Maddy is not having any more children. Thomasina and I have not made up our minds when, or if, we'll add to our families. But I like to think that the babies the three of us produced in a single year will be closer than mere cousins. Jack, Isobel and Oscar. The names go well together. Last month, during a trip back home, we sat in a room and watched our children with a feeling close to astonishment. We three had become six. It seemed a kind of miracle. None of the babies looks like each other. You wouldn't be able to tell they are related. Jack is big and bold and naughty looking, Isobel blonde and smiley, Oscar is small with dark hair and skin. But we can see similarities. One has Maddy's dimple, another has my eyes, a third the long line of Thomasina's cheek. When we look at our children, we see our sisters there.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Transfixed she was; gooseberry-eyed through a window in south London. Willow may well be the first cat in history to learn the secrets of making a fine, fault-less, no-fuss florentine. Willow's co-habitants, Joan Byrne and daughter Carlotta, 11, were rather fascinated, too, as the Kitchen Doctor, or KD, rustled up a crash-course in how to bake cakes with minimal cash yet maximum panache. While young Carlotta is no novice baker, she had come to sense a certain floppiness in her skills, while, at least in these matters, mum Joan saw her role as supervisory. Yet Joan did harbour one burning desire: to learn the secrets of cake-making without flour.</p> <p>And so it was that Rosie Sykes, our KD, found herself bound for Peckham. Within minutes of arriving at Schloss Byrne, she had thrown herself and her latest prot\u00e9g\u00e9e-cum-patient, Carlotta, deep into the lemony mix of the school cake. Since school is one of Carlotta's key preoccupations at the moment, KD had created this cake to be broadly in the spirit of school days. Accordingly, it is heavily dependent on semolina, which takes the place of flour. It is also heavily dependent on a thorough whisking. So, before you could say core curriculum, Carlotta was steering a robust electric whisk around the mixing bowl.</p> <p>After closely watching the blender perform dozens of figures-of-eight around the bowl, Willow was thoroughly hypnotised and Joan had beaten a retreat to the living room, but the bowl's contents resembled a light, lemony cloud and were, as Rosie declared, \"Ready\".</p> <p>Next, KD revealed the extent of that morning's shop in downtown Peckham: organic currants, something called crystallised citron, huge muscatel berries from Australia, chocolate and chocolate and more chocolate. After half-an-hour or so, the school cake was placed in the oven and work began on the next project: moussey chocolate cake. Again, Carlotta's skills in the whisking department were called on until the desired moussey peak-and-trough moonscape was achieved.</p> <p>By now, the kitchen microclimate had progressed from south London temperate to Amazon Basin tropical. The effect of half-a-dozen bodies in a relatively confined space, combined with an oven at full blast, began to take its toll on the KD, whose face was turning crimson. Even Willow began to wilt.</p> <p>Luckily, help was at hand. On this call-out, KD had brought along Invaluable Imogen, whose lot it was to peel, scrape, wash and chop, and this she did with good cheer, apparently oblivious to the heat that was threatening to bake cakes outside the oven. Every cook should have an Invaluable Imogen.</p> <p>Despite the pace slowing due to heat exhaustion, Rosie remained mindful that she was in these strangers' kitchen not to expire on the floor but to educate. So she seized a pair of knives, fixed Carlotta with an intense gaze, and said, \"And now, we're going to learn the very exciting rubbing-in method.\" Pretty basic stuff, she confessed, but still something that all would-be bakers should get to grips with.</p> <p>Carlotta watched as Rosie made merry with butter and flour, then took over herself. The key, it was explained, was to rub-in gently but methodically (in this case, extremely methodically), but the ends certainly justified the means.</p> <p>By now, it was time to investigate the school cake. Taken out of the oven, it appeared fully baked and golden-brown, but a well-aimed, firm prod didn't give that firm, spongy feel, and instead caused ripples like a pebble in a pond. Back into the oven: which just shows that baking times serve as a rough guide, since ovens vary so much in character that, ultimately, the firm prod remains the most reliable test to sort baked from unbaked.</p> <p>But what of the florentines? The first batch was retrieved from the oven, where they had been baking for just a few minutes. In that time, they'd expanded from two-inch-high dollops to four-inch-across dollops, and looked exquisite. Everyone made that mmooaggh farmyard-type noise of approval, but Rosie was having none of it. \"In the bin!\" she commanded. \"We'll do them again!\" The florentines had, it appeared, lingered a minute or two too long in the oven. With no one daring to voice dissent, the next batch was hastily prepared.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the hokey-pokey biscuit mix was assailed with a fork, and then the second batch of florentines emerged - this time with no trace of sunburn. By now, Rosie was decelerating from her normal cruising speed, the kitchen was transformed into a hothouse of sweet, exotic smells, Imogen had mastered the washing-up, Willow was loitering in the wings and the Byrnes had learned a thing or three about baking. All that was left to do was eat.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Important points to remember about baking:</b></p> <p>\u0095 Accuracy in measuring, temperature and cooking time is all-important.</p> <p>\u0095 Always preheat the oven.</p> <p>\u0095 Bake on the middle shelf of the oven.</p> <p>\u0095 Air is one of the mose important ingredients in cakes.</p> <p>\u0095 Use eggs that are at room temperature.</p> <p><b> Moussey chocolate cake</b></p> <p><b>5 eggs, separated</b></p> <p><b>125g caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>125g butter, cut into cubes</b></p> <p><b>250g plain chocolate</b></p> <p><b>Pinch of salt</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp brandy (or anything from Cointreau to Tia Maria), optional</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Break the chocolate into smallish pieces, place in a bowl with the butter (and the alcohol, if using) and cover. Put the bowl over a pan of hot water, and stir every now and then, until the chocolate has melted.</p> <p>Line the base of a cake tin with greaseproof paper, then grease the paper and sides with butter. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until very thick. Wash the whisk, make sure it is dry, then whisk the whites, together with a pinch of salt, until they form soft peaks. By now, the chocolate should be melted, so give it a stir and carefully amalgamate with the yolk mix. Add a good spoonful of whites and stir throughly, then fold in the rest.</p> <p>Pour carefully into the prepared cake tin, and bake on a tray for about 30 minutes, until the cake is set - a good sign is that it may have cracked a little on top. Leave to cool for five minutes, then turn out on to a cooling rack. Once cool, if you want, top with a little more dark chocolate melted with butter, or dust with icing sugar and cocoa, or put lots of berries and whipped double cream on top. For a more refined version, add some prunes soaked in brandy to the mix, 75-100g ground almonds to the melted chocolate, and top with some cr\u00e8me frache mixed with cinnamon and shavings of really dark chocolate or flaked almonds.</p> <p><b> School cake</b></p> <p>So called as it's made with semolina, though this cake is light as a cloud.</p> <p><b> 5 eggs, separated</b></p> <p><b>Grated lemon rind</b></p> <p><b>250g caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>125g semolina</b></p> <p><b>125g ground almonds</b></p> <p><b>tsp baking powder</b></p> <p><b>150ml water or milk</b></p> <p><b>Pinch of salt</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Lightly grease a deep cake tin. Whisk the egg yolks with the zest and sugar until moussey and light. Stir in the baking powder, semolina, almonds and the liquid, and blend until smooth. Whisk the whites with the salt until they form soft peaks. Loosen the yolk mix with a big spoonful of whites, then fold in the rest. Pour into the tin and bake for 40 minutes, until firm.</p> <p>While the cake is still warm, you could drizzle a citrus sugar syrup over it, to make a sticky, moist cake; or, once cool, cut it in half across the middle, fill with lemon curd (or jam and cream) and dust with icing sugar. Joan and Carlotta went for a caramelised banana and mascarpone filling.</p> <p><b> Loch Katrine Cake</b></p> <p>A fave from my childhood, this is a good basic sponge, albeit used differently.</p> <p>For the base</p> <p><b> 150g plain flour</b></p> <p><b>50g butter</b></p> <p><b>1 tsp baking powder</b></p> <p><b>3-4 tbsp milk</b></p> <p><b>Raspberry jam</b></p> <p><b>Large handful of currants</b></p> <p>For the sponge</p> <p><b> 50g softened butter</b></p> <p><b>100g sugar</b></p> <p><b>150g flour</b></p> <p><b>1 tsp baking powder</b></p> <p><b>2 eggs</b></p> <p><b>4-6 tbsp milk</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4.

Leave to rest and make the sponge: cream the butter and sugar until light. Sift the flour and baking powder, and beat the eggs. Add half the flour and the eggs to the creamed mix, then stir in the remaining flour.</p> <p>Roll out the dough to fit a rectangular baking tin. Spread a layer of jam on top, sprinkle with currants and cover with sponge mix. Bake for 30 minutes, until the sponge springs back. Leave to cool. (I like to top this with lemon icing: sift icing sugar, add butter and enough lemon juice and water to make a spreadable, but not too runny, mix, then add lemon zest.

      "bodyText": "Transfixed she was; gooseberry-eyed through a window in south London. Willow may well be the first cat in history to learn the secrets of making a fine, fault-less, no-fuss florentine. Willow's co-habitants, Joan Byrne and daughter Carlotta, 11, were rather fascinated, too, as the Kitchen Doctor, or KD, rustled up a crash-course in how to bake cakes with minimal cash yet maximum panache. While young Carlotta is no novice baker, she had come to sense a certain floppiness in her skills, while, at least in these matters, mum Joan saw her role as supervisory. Yet Joan did harbour one burning desire: to learn the secrets of cake-making without flour. And so it was that Rosie Sykes, our KD, found herself bound for Peckham. Within minutes of arriving at Schloss Byrne, she had thrown herself and her latest prot\u00e9g\u00e9e-cum-patient, Carlotta, deep into the lemony mix of the school cake. Since school is one of Carlotta's key preoccupations at the moment, KD had created this cake to be broadly in the spirit of school days. Accordingly, it is heavily dependent on semolina, which takes the place of flour. It is also heavily dependent on a thorough whisking. So, before you could say core curriculum, Carlotta was steering a robust electric whisk around the mixing bowl. After closely watching the blender perform dozens of figures-of-eight around the bowl, Willow was thoroughly hypnotised and Joan had beaten a retreat to the living room, but the bowl's contents resembled a light, lemony cloud and were, as Rosie declared, \"Ready\". Next, KD revealed the extent of that morning's shop in downtown Peckham: organic currants, something called crystallised citron, huge muscatel berries from Australia, chocolate and chocolate and more chocolate. After half-an-hour or so, the school cake was placed in the oven and work began on the next project: moussey chocolate cake. Again, Carlotta's skills in the whisking department were called on until the desired moussey peak-and-trough moonscape was achieved. By now, the kitchen microclimate had progressed from south London temperate to Amazon Basin tropical. The effect of half-a-dozen bodies in a relatively confined space, combined with an oven at full blast, began to take its toll on the KD, whose face was turning crimson. Even Willow began to wilt. Luckily, help was at hand. On this call-out, KD had brought along Invaluable Imogen, whose lot it was to peel, scrape, wash and chop, and this she did with good cheer, apparently oblivious to the heat that was threatening to bake cakes outside the oven. Every cook should have an Invaluable Imogen. Despite the pace slowing due to heat exhaustion, Rosie remained mindful that she was in these strangers' kitchen not to expire on the floor but to educate. So she seized a pair of knives, fixed Carlotta with an intense gaze, and said, \"And now, we're going to learn the very exciting rubbing-in method.\" Pretty basic stuff, she confessed, but still something that all would-be bakers should get to grips with. Carlotta watched as Rosie made merry with butter and flour, then took over herself. The key, it was explained, was to rub-in gently but methodically (in this case, extremely methodically), but the ends certainly justified the means. By now, it was time to investigate the school cake. Taken out of the oven, it appeared fully baked and golden-brown, but a well-aimed, firm prod didn't give that firm, spongy feel, and instead caused ripples like a pebble in a pond. Back into the oven: which just shows that baking times serve as a rough guide, since ovens vary so much in character that, ultimately, the firm prod remains the most reliable test to sort baked from unbaked. But what of the florentines? The first batch was retrieved from the oven, where they had been baking for just a few minutes. In that time, they'd expanded from two-inch-high dollops to four-inch-across dollops, and looked exquisite. Everyone made that mmooaggh farmyard-type noise of approval, but Rosie was having none of it. \"In the bin!\" she commanded. \"We'll do them again!\" The florentines had, it appeared, lingered a minute or two too long in the oven. With no one daring to voice dissent, the next batch was hastily prepared. Meanwhile, the hokey-pokey biscuit mix was assailed with a fork, and then the second batch of florentines emerged - this time with no trace of sunburn. By now, Rosie was decelerating from her normal cruising speed, the kitchen was transformed into a hothouse of sweet, exotic smells, Imogen had mastered the washing-up, Willow was loitering in the wings and the Byrnes had learned a thing or three about baking. All that was left to do was eat. All recipes serve six. Important points to remember about baking: \u0095 Accuracy in measuring, temperature and cooking time is all-important. \u0095 Always preheat the oven. \u0095 Bake on the middle shelf of the oven. \u0095 Air is one of the mose important ingredients in cakes. \u0095 Use eggs that are at room temperature. Moussey chocolate cake 5 eggs, separated 125g caster sugar 125g butter, cut into cubes 250g plain chocolate Pinch of salt 1 tbsp brandy (or anything from Cointreau to Tia Maria), optional Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Break the chocolate into smallish pieces, place in a bowl with the butter (and the alcohol, if using) and cover. Put the bowl over a pan of hot water, and stir every now and then, until the chocolate has melted. Line the base of a cake tin with greaseproof paper, then grease the paper and sides with butter. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until very thick. Wash the whisk, make sure it is dry, then whisk the whites, together with a pinch of salt, until they form soft peaks. By now, the chocolate should be melted, so give it a stir and carefully amalgamate with the yolk mix. Add a good spoonful of whites and stir throughly, then fold in the rest. Pour carefully into the prepared cake tin, and bake on a tray for about 30 minutes, until the cake is set - a good sign is that it may have cracked a little on top. Leave to cool for five minutes, then turn out on to a cooling rack. Once cool, if you want, top with a little more dark chocolate melted with butter, or dust with icing sugar and cocoa, or put lots of berries and whipped double cream on top. For a more refined version, add some prunes soaked in brandy to the mix, 75-100g ground almonds to the melted chocolate, and top with some cr\u00e8me frache mixed with cinnamon and shavings of really dark chocolate or flaked almonds. School cake So called as it's made with semolina, though this cake is light as a cloud. 5 eggs, separated Grated lemon rind 250g caster sugar 125g semolina 125g ground almonds tsp baking powder 150ml water or milk Pinch of salt Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Lightly grease a deep cake tin. Whisk the egg yolks with the zest and sugar until moussey and light. Stir in the baking powder, semolina, almonds and the liquid, and blend until smooth. Whisk the whites with the salt until they form soft peaks. Loosen the yolk mix with a big spoonful of whites, then fold in the rest. Pour into the tin and bake for 40 minutes, until firm. While the cake is still warm, you could drizzle a citrus sugar syrup over it, to make a sticky, moist cake; or, once cool, cut it in half across the middle, fill with lemon curd (or jam and cream) and dust with icing sugar. Joan and Carlotta went for a caramelised banana and mascarpone filling. Loch Katrine Cake A fave from my childhood, this is a good basic sponge, albeit used differently. For the base 150g plain flour 50g butter 1 tsp baking powder 3-4 tbsp milk Raspberry jam Large handful of currants For the sponge 50g softened butter 100g sugar 150g flour 1 tsp baking powder 2 eggs 4-6 tbsp milk Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. First, make the base: rub the butter into the flour and baking powder until it resembles coarse crumbs, then add enough milk to bind the mix: you want a stiffish dough. Leave to rest and make the sponge: cream the butter and sugar until light. Sift the flour and baking powder, and beat the eggs. Add half the flour and the eggs to the creamed mix, then stir in the remaining flour. Roll out the dough to fit a rectangular baking tin. Spread a layer of jam on top, sprinkle with currants and cover with sponge mix. Bake for 30 minutes, until the sponge springs back. Leave to cool. (I like to top this with lemon icing: sift icing sugar, add butter and enough lemon juice and water to make a spreadable, but not too runny, mix, then add lemon zest. Spread over the cake and, once set, cut into squares.) Hokey Pokey Biscuits Another childhood memory. 125g butter 125g sugar 1 tbsp Golden Syrup 1 tbsp milk 225g plain flour 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Combine the butter, sugar, syrup and milk in a pan, heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is set to boil, then put aside to cool a little. Sift in the flour and bicarb, and stir to form a stiff dough. Break off pieces of dough, roll into balls and place on baking trays. Flatten into circles with a floured fork, and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden. Biscuits A simple, all-purpose dough that can be flavoured as desired. 125g softened butter 150g sugar tsp vanilla essence 1 egg 300g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder (optional) Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Cream the butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Stir in the egg, then sift in the flour and baking powder. Mix to a stiff dough, break off pieces and roll into balls. Place on a tray and flatten with a floured fork (for a neater finish, leave the dough to rest for 20 minutes in the fridge, then roll out to around cm thick and cut into shapes). Bake for 12 minutes, until golden. Add cocoa or grated chocolate for chocolate biscuits; or nuts, orange or lemon zest, dried fruit or crystallised ginger (orange zest and cardamom make good grown-up biscuits). Florentines A dead-easy recipe from an aunt in New Zealand. 110g butter 2 tbsp Golden Syrup 100g brown sugar 50g flaked almonds 50g chopped hazelnuts 75g sultanas 75g candied mixed peel 75g flour 150g dark chocolate Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Heat the butter, sugar and syrup until the butter is melted, then add everything else bar the chocolate and stir. Drop small spoonfuls on to baking parchment, and bake until bubbling, golden and toffee-like. Remove from the oven and leave on the tray for about five minutes - they will crisp up as they cool - then spread one side with melted chocolate and leave to set. Scones A basic recipe from which stems endless sweet and savoury possibilities. 450g plain flour 6 tsp baking powder tsp salt 75g butter, cut into cubes 250-375ml milk Extra milk to glaze Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl, add the butter, then rub it in until the mix is the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Add 250ml milk, and mix to a soft dough, adding up to 125ml more milk to achieve this. Turn out of the bowl and knead a little. Roll out the dough to 3cm thick, then cut into circles or squares. Glaze with milk. Place on an oven tray and bake for 10 minutes until golden-brown. Eat while warm with lashings of butter, jam, etc. (For savoury scones, add 75g grated cheese, cayenne pepper, mustard, chopped herbs, olives, sun-dried tomatoes or finely chopped red onion: whatever takes your fancy. For sweeter scones, add 1 tbsp sugar, honey or maple syrup, and a handful of dried fruit and cinnamon.) \u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

      "bodyText": "Wendy Holden, 34, grew up in Yorkshire. Educated at a comprehensive, she read English Literature at Cambridge University. She went on to become deputy editor of Tatler, and worked on Harpers &amp; Queen and The Sunday Times. Her first novel, Simply Divine, was published in 1999 and became a bestseller. Her new book is Bad Heir Day. She is married and lives in London. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Getting into a freshly-made bed with a wonderful book. What is your greatest fear? Something happening to harm my husband. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? I worry about absolutely everything. What is the trait you most deplore in others? Noisy eaters with tumble-drier mouths. What is your greatest extravagance? A cottage in Derbyshire, where I write at weekends. What do you most dislike about your appearance? My large, square kneecaps. What is your most unappealing habit? Always sitting down next to mad or smelly people on the tube. What is your favourite journey? Flying to Nice each summer for our holiday. Last year, a little boy sat behind us on the plane and when it went through the clouds he shouted, 'Where's God?' Should the Royal Family be scrapped? Definitely not - they're the best soap opera going. Do you believe in monogamy? Yes. If you're lucky and it works, I can't imagine anything better. What or who is the greatest love of your life? My husband. What do you consider the most overrated virtue? Speaking as you find. What is your greatest regret? That my father had a stroke the day before Simply Divine was published. He would have loved the excitement, but was too ill to know about any of it. How often do you have sex? Often enough. But no one has as much sex as everyone else imagines they do. What single thing would improve the quality of your life? Someone to do the ironing. How would you like to die? Awake, standing up and resisting it all the way, like Elizabeth I. How would you like to be remembered? With a smile. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? Keep trying. If you're determined enough, you'll get there in the end.",

      "body": "<p>It's a long time since I was in Bath. As a small boy, I had a bit of an aversion to it and, World Heritage site or not, I've never quite lost my dread of the place. I had a brace of aunts who lived there, Aunts Avis and Ellie, who were tall, dark, angular, austere bags of bones, and they disapproved of me. In reality, they were probably sweet old dears, but that is not how they struck me.</p> <p>Yet back in Bath the other day it was hard to cling on to those dark memories. The place had sparkled in the afternoon light of a genial spring day, and in the evening its lights sparkled up at me and Fosdyke through the floor-to- ceiling windows of Lettonie, set on the hill above the town.</p> <p>Every now and then, I am moved to go and visit a top-drawer restaurant. You may think that I spend my time in them, but I like to think that I'm quite conscientious, opting for variety in terms of price, culinary culture and location. Anyway, I had been meaning to go to Lettonie for an age - it is a restaurant that has figured in the upper echelons of guide ratings and critical comments for some time, and every now and then you have to go and see what all the fuss is about.</p> <p>The creation of the Blunos family - Martin the chef and Sin front-of-house - it moved to an unmistakably grand building in Bath a couple of years back. Indeed, it is grander than any other restaurant I can think of. Grand though the Oak Room, say, or the dining room at the Ritz may be, they don't have a sequence of rooms of such Palladian spaciousness - the happy combination of scale, high ceilings, huge windows, generous mouldings and tasteful decoration. What prevents Lettonie from toppling over into Sense And Sensibility overkill is that most of the walls in the reception room, itself larger than a good many restaurants, are hung with photographs of the Blunos family. The same is true of the bar, or whatever you want to call the stately room in which Fosdyke and I ruminated over the menu. The pictures add a domestic note to the place, an air reinforced by the service, which managed to find that rare balance of friendliness and easy professionalism.</p> <p>There is an equally cheering cast to the food. There was a commendable shortage of what you might call luxury ingredients, and several that you don't see on many menus of restaurants of whatever pedigree, let alone those twinkling with Michelin stars - brawn, oxtail, shepherd's pie, belly pork and haggis, to name but a few. I think we must thank Martin Blunos's Latvian ancestry for this elevation of the humble.</p> <p>Fosdyke wanted a lightish affair, so opted for cod, ham and scallop chowder with a tomato tartlet, followed by a dish of lamb cutlets with the shepherds' pie. As there was both a light nibble before the first course and another before the pudding, and as he wallopped the bread pretty heavily, too, perhaps it wasn't surprising that he fell at the pudding hurdle. I, however, am in training, so managed a hot rhubarb souffl\u00e9 with cardamom and rhubarb sauce and vanilla ice, having already demolished a terrine of brawn, and roast zander with salsify, crayfish and wild mushrooms, potato and salsify cake and a crayfish sabayon.</p> <p>The brawn would have brought a tear of pleasure to my mother's eye (it is a particular favourite of hers). It was as beautiful as it was unexpected, delicately flavoured and precisely textured, with a little spoonful of seed mustard and a class-A salad to cut the richness. Fosdyke's chowder was a similarly accomplished dish, the cod, ham and scallop each retaining their taste and texture in spite of being cut to polite-eating size, and the richness of the cream in the soup brought to heel by a fine fish stock.</p> <p>The zander, too, was a fine dish, though perhaps not of quite the same exalted standard, in spite of a gold-medal-winning sauce. The lamb cutlets were impeccable, very fine pieces of meat with a cheerful sweetness; the shepherds' pie with them looked like a mini circus tent, its frivolous exterior covering serious flavour; and the gravy, jus or sauce (call it what you will) carried a liquor-rich weight that dramatically increased the overall impact of a fairly standard dish. The souffl\u00e9 brought my dinner to a resounding conclusion: it was an astoundingly potent piece of pudding-making.</p> <p>I wouldn't say that this is food that astounds or exalts. It's not of the gob-smacking, how-did-he-do-that? variety, all pyrotechnics and power-cooking. Instead, it is lovingly-crafted, and the details have been worked at until they take on a lapidary gleam. They are perfectly and precisely what they are supposed to be. Having said that, there were some details that distracted from a sense of perfection: I couldn't make out what the tomato tart was doing with the chowder, the texture of the brioche was at odds with the brawn, and the mushrooms with the fish seemed to have been baked in stale-tasting oil. These may be a matter of taste, but they weren't to mine.</p> <p>Okay, now for the hard part. Dinner costs \u00a347.50 for a nominal three courses, though in reality it's five (or even six, if you count the plentiful choccie things that come with the coffee). Our bill came to \u00a3146.55, and included a half-bottle of decent Sancerre at \u00a318.65 and half a bottle of brilliant Savigny-les-Beaune at \u00a325.25 from a curiously muted list, a bottle of mineral water, a glass of champagne and another of sherry. However, they had also, with great thoughtfulness, deducted the cost of a pudding from the set menu, which I think generous. And, on reflection, generous is the word that best describes Lettonie all round.</p>",

I am running a Selective Garden and I don't care! Mind you, this anti-Livingstone business is blowing the cold embers of my socialism back into a flicker.

Load up trolley and roll on towards the lupins: must buy seven, since I read somewhere that you should always buy in odd numbers. Political correctness nowhere more rampant than in gardening. Remember Jilly Cooper said red geraniums were considered vulgar and one must only have pale pink. Perhaps New Labour's rejection of the red flag is a sign that they are socially upwardly mobile. \"The People's Flag is Face-Powder Pink.\" Help myself to lots of deep red things just to irritate Blair and show my solidarity with the proletariat.</p> <p>Advance on check-out like Birnam Forest coming to Dunsinane, and while queuing gaze in complacent rapture at my white and red plants. Then remember old adage, one of Great-Aunt Elspeth's favourites: \" Neverrr have rrred and white togetherrr , dearrr - its a wound and a winding sheet!\" Hope the bad karma will be more than cancelled out by a bit of blue, so grab extra delphiniums and keep fingers crossed.</p> <p>Drive home determined to revel in new persona. We Are A Gardener. Would prefer to prune roses than attempt to cut off short Aunt's agitated monologues. Would much rather dig deep, stiff loam than try to get to the root of Henry's anomie. Will bestow muck on my grateful plants rather than try to force Omega-3 fish oils down ungrateful ex-Spouse's gullet.</p> <p>Front door is thrown open by Harriet, looking frantic. \"Mum! We can't wake Dad up! Come quick! I think there's something wrong! Oh God! Is he dead?\"</p> <p>Race to sitting room and shake ex-Spouse, who is slumped in posture suggestive of profound seizure. Oh God! The wound and the winding sheet! Grab phone to summon ambulance when ex-Spouse jerks upright and everybody choruses \"April Fool!\" Most diverting.</p> <p>Later, ask Harriet for change from the fiver for the sanitary towels. \"I spent it on lip gloss,\" she smiles. \"I knew you wouldn't mind cos it's Factor 15.\"</p> <p>Oh well. Find some comfort in the thought that at least menstruation is a simply red experience which New Labour can't do anything about.</p>",

Advance on check-out like Birnam Forest coming to Dunsinane, and while queuing gaze in complacent rapture at my white and red plants. Then remember old adage, one of Great-Aunt Elspeth's favourites: \" Neverrr have rrred and white togetherrr , dearrr - its a wound and a winding sheet!\" Hope the bad karma will be more than cancelled out by a bit of blue, so grab extra delphiniums and keep fingers crossed. Drive home determined to revel in new persona. We Are A Gardener. Would prefer to prune roses than attempt to cut off short Aunt's agitated monologues. Would much rather dig deep, stiff loam than try to get to the root of Henry's anomie. Will bestow muck on my grateful plants rather than try to force Omega-3 fish oils down ungrateful ex-Spouse's gullet. Front door is thrown open by Harriet, looking frantic. \"Mum! We can't wake Dad up! Come quick! I think there's something wrong! Oh God! Is he dead?\" Race to sitting room and shake ex-Spouse, who is slumped in posture suggestive of profound seizure. Oh God! The wound and the winding sheet! Grab phone to summon ambulance when ex-Spouse jerks upright and everybody choruses \"April Fool!\" Most diverting. Later, ask Harriet for change from the fiver for the sanitary towels. \"I spent it on lip gloss,\" she smiles. \"I knew you wouldn't mind cos it's Factor 15.\" Oh well. Find some comfort in the thought that at least menstruation is a simply red experience which New Labour can't do anything about.",

      "body": "<p>Theresa from New York gets quite misty-eyed when she talks about her self-storage unit in Manhattan. She is a high-powered film executive now working in London, but put her personal effects into a tiny hired room in a battered but fine old warehouse long before she had to move across the Atlantic. \"There is so little room in Manhattan's apartments that it is common for people to store stuff that they can't fit into their lives but just can't bear to throw away,\" she says. \"I would pretend that I was going to pick something very important up and actually spend an entire day rummaging around, looking through photos or letters, getting lost in my past. It is all still there waiting for me.\"</p> <p>Although space is not as tight in Britain as it is in Manhattan, we are still a \"nation of hoarders\", according to Adam Ealand, manager of Squirrel storage. Personal storage used to be the preserve of officers and gentlemen posted abroad, who would use the impressive Harrods Depository by the river Thames at Barnes, west London (which, in 1981, was turned into luxury apartments), as safe houses for their personal effects.</p> <p>Now, however, we use self-storage to put off having to throw out our past. The steel units of varying size and price keep our memories safe from damp, and in some cases (particularly the husband who keeps his pornography collection in a steel-bound unit in Wells, Somerset) from disapproving or acquisitive relatives.</p> <p>\"Most people tell themselves they are storing things of worth, but if you work out the weekly rental against the cost of the old bed, a couple of chairs, some paintings and piles of old books, then you can quickly see that it is of emotional rather then financial value,\" says Ealand. \"Retired couples who move into smaller homes can't bear to part with the bits and bobs they consider to be their heritage, and so they lovingly store it and leave the contents in their will to their heirs. Then, the problem about what to do with the stuff is simply passed on.\"</p> <p>My own encounter with self- storage is a perfect illustration of that - in flight from a failed marriage in France with a lorry-load of furniture and boxes that I was not in a fit state to sift through, I packed it into a metal container and didn't pick it up until I moved into my own house a year later. When I opened it up, I was surprised to find that the stuff I had fought so hard to keep and had paid a weekly rental for filled me with the worst and most stifling kind of nostalgia.</p> <p>With a hired van, I drove to the dump (which is right near the storage place) and got rid of the bed, sofa and all the old clothes. I couldn't help thinking of the time and money I would have saved if I'd visited the recycling centre first.</p> <p>Divorce also brought David King to self-storage. When he split up with his wife, he found a beautiful longboat on the Thames at Pitstone. \"Obviously, I have a lot of things that wouldn't fit into the longboat,\" he says, \"so I found a storage place relatively nearby, where I can come and go as I please, using it rather like someone else might use the spare room or garage. It is quite convenient, and means that my day-to-day life is relatively uncluttered.\"</p> <p>Susan Methan-Ford, who stores with the upmarket Big Yellow, is also a regular visitor to her unit. Many of the Big Yellow centres have swanky foyers, drinks machines and smiling, helpful staff - contrasting with the grim, no-questions-asked atmosphere of some of the self- storage units in, say, King's Cross, London. She wants her new flat in Notting Hill to be sparse and modern, and so has an excess not only of the Victoriana and glitzy, glam stuff that used to fill her large home in Richmond, but also with an awful lot of personal baggage.</p> <p>\"I have kept things belonging to my children and odd things like my wedding dress and a white mink jacket that is so tiny I can't believe I used to fit into it. I am a great accumulator of stuff, and yet want to live in a minimal, fashionable way, so storage is my answer.</p> <p>\"Sometimes, I think it might give me bad karma to be such a collector of what to most people is junk. Then I persuade myself that is people like me who preserve things for the future. If we all did what these lifestyle gurus said and threw everything out, then we would have nothing left now, would we?\"</p> <p>Denise Moorcroft-Hogan, who has worked at the reception of the Big Yellow storage centre in Staples Corner, north London, for more than 10 years, says that \"it is a fascinating job that requires a certain amount of understanding and discretion. For every straightforward house move, there are clients who have had their houses repossessed, relatives die, or have split up from their partners. One woman had her late aunt's stuff in here for years - she visited almost as often as someone else would go and visit their relatives who are alive and well.\"</p> <p>Self-storage can be a liberation, a means to a freer, more nomadic existence. For the charity worker, the international high-flyer or the perpetual traveller, say, it enables some roots to be kept somewhere, even if it is only in a storage unit near the North Circular road. In Alan Bennett's story, The Clothes They Stood Up In, a rather staid couple have every scrap of their existence mistakenly removed and put into storage. Once she has got over the shock, Mrs Ransome feels that to be \"parted from all her worldly goods might bring with it benefits she would have hesitated to call spiritual but which might, more briskly, be put under the heading of 'improving the character'.\"</p> <p>For Patricia du Pont-de Bis, on the other hand, self-storage is an efficient way to help with her work. She buys properties, does them up with style, and sells them on. For that, she needs a reserve of furniture and household effects, and so has a number of storage units with \"mini-homes\" inside them. Her daughter, Natascha, however, slips in some of her own stuff alongside her mother's for the more usual reasons: lack of space, an inability to decide what to throw out and, perhaps, the belief that one day she'll one day have a bigger place to live.</p> <p>Optimism about having a bigger place or a house in the country is a theme that seems to run through many a tale of self-storage. For some of us, that dream will never come true, of course, but one friend, who had been living in Russia and was in the process of reclaiming her stuff from storage to move back into her flat, said that she witnessed a scene of \"pure poetry\".</p> <p>\"A group of unusually handsome boys were clearing their stuff out and whooping with happiness and excitement,\" she recalled. \"The caretaker told me that they were a boy band who had a top 10 hit and so had managed to buy some roomy bachelor pads with their royalty money. He then spoilt it a bit by asking if I had heard their record, and when I said no, he smiled, tutted, shook his head and said, 'They will be back. You mark my words. Within a couple of years at the most, they will be knocking at our door again.'\"</p>",

Many of the Big Yellow centres have swanky foyers, drinks machines and smiling, helpful staff - contrasting with the grim, no-questions-asked atmosphere of some of the self- storage units in, say, King's Cross, London. She wants her new flat in Notting Hill to be sparse and modern, and so has an excess not only of the Victoriana and glitzy, glam stuff that used to fill her large home in Richmond, but also with an awful lot of personal baggage. \"I have kept things belonging to my children and odd things like my wedding dress and a white mink jacket that is so tiny I can't believe I used to fit into it. I am a great accumulator of stuff, and yet want to live in a minimal, fashionable way, so storage is my answer. \"Sometimes, I think it might give me bad karma to be such a collector of what to most people is junk. Then I persuade myself that is people like me who preserve things for the future. If we all did what these lifestyle gurus said and threw everything out, then we would have nothing left now, would we?\" Denise Moorcroft-Hogan, who has worked at the reception of the Big Yellow storage centre in Staples Corner, north London, for more than 10 years, says that \"it is a fascinating job that requires a certain amount of understanding and discretion. For every straightforward house move, there are clients who have had their houses repossessed, relatives die, or have split up from their partners. One woman had her late aunt's stuff in here for years - she visited almost as often as someone else would go and visit their relatives who are alive and well.\" Self-storage can be a liberation, a means to a freer, more nomadic existence. For the charity worker, the international high-flyer or the perpetual traveller, say, it enables some roots to be kept somewhere, even if it is only in a storage unit near the North Circular road. In Alan Bennett's story, The Clothes They Stood Up In, a rather staid couple have every scrap of their existence mistakenly removed and put into storage. Once she has got over the shock, Mrs Ransome feels that to be \"parted from all her worldly goods might bring with it benefits she would have hesitated to call spiritual but which might, more briskly, be put under the heading of 'improving the character'.\" For Patricia du Pont-de Bis, on the other hand, self-storage is an efficient way to help with her work. She buys properties, does them up with style, and sells them on. For that, she needs a reserve of furniture and household effects, and so has a number of storage units with \"mini-homes\" inside them. Her daughter, Natascha, however, slips in some of her own stuff alongside her mother's for the more usual reasons: lack of space, an inability to decide what to throw out and, perhaps, the belief that one day she'll one day have a bigger place to live. Optimism about having a bigger place or a house in the country is a theme that seems to run through many a tale of self-storage. For some of us, that dream will never come true, of course, but one friend, who had been living in Russia and was in the process of reclaiming her stuff from storage to move back into her flat, said that she witnessed a scene of \"pure poetry\". \"A group of unusually handsome boys were clearing their stuff out and whooping with happiness and excitement,\" she recalled. \"The caretaker told me that they were a boy band who had a top 10 hit and so had managed to buy some roomy bachelor pads with their royalty money. He then spoilt it a bit by asking if I had heard their record, and when I said no, he smiled, tutted, shook his head and said, 'They will be back. You mark my words. Within a couple of years at the most, they will be knocking at our door again.'\"",

      "bodyText": "Greenpeace activists yesterday occupied a second oil rig in Scottish waters within a week in the latest stage of the environmental group's protest at oil exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. The companies which own and operate the rig immediately went to court and were granted an interdict ordering four of the activists, who had attached themselves to the legs of the Sovereign Explorer, to end their protest. By early evening the protesters had left the rig. The protest in the Cromarty Firth, near Inverness, began yesterday morning. It is understood that police were tipped off about the operation and 30 Greenpeace protesters were arrested before they could board the rig. The Sovereign Explorer had been stowed in the firth over the winter and was being upgraded to make it suitable for drilling for oil in the Atlantic. Last weekend, Greenpeace protesters boarded another rig berthed in the Cromarty Firth, the Jack Bates, just as it was due to be towed out to the Atlantic. Yesterday's action was the latest round of a Greenpeace campaign against what it describes as Britain's over reliance on fossil fuels and the government's decision to allow exploration in the Atlantic frontier, an area of the ocean which houses coral reefs and is a breeding ground for rare species of whales. The Sovereign Explorer rig is chartered to Marathon Oil but is owned by TransOcean FedCo For Ex (TSF). Marathon has held a licence to drill in the frontier since 1997 and the rig was due to begin further exploration there later in the year. \"These activities are entirely within the law and sanctioned by the UK government. Greenpeace is all about soundbites and selective science. The rest of us have to live in the real world,\" said the spokesman. Rob Gueterbrock, Greenpeace's climate and energy campaigns spokesman, said oil exploration in the Atlantic frontier was opposed by all of Britain's environmental campaign groups and he accused Marathon Oil of denying that fossil fuels were responsible for global warming. \"We already have more fossil fuels than we can ever burn if we are to limit global warming. The government should be looking at promoting renewable sources of energy - not this. They are backing the wrong horse,\" he added. The two Greenpeace activists who climbed on to the Jack Bates rig on Sunday came down on Monday afternoon after Enterprise Oil won an interdict. The protesters were spirited away in a motor launch by fellow activists and have still not been apprehended by police for questioning. Enterprise Oil is seeking legal damages of \u00a31m over the incident. But the Marathon Oil spokesman said that the company was not, at present, seeking damages.",

      "body": "<b>Barrister jailed for blackmail</b> <p>A barrister was jailed at the Old Bailey for a total of 15 months yesterday after pleading guilty to blackmailing a client and forgery to try to obtain credit from Harrods' bank. Judge David Paget told Carol Winston-Churchill, 47: \"Your career as a lawyer is now over. You are disgraced and destroyed.\" </p> <p>The court heard that Winston-Churchill,from Hampstead, north London, had been disbarred last month for unrelated matters of misconduct. </p> <p>The judge said the sentences would have been higher had the offences not been 14 years ago. Winston-Churchill was to stand trial in 1987 but fled to Jamaica. Despite two warrants she returned to Britain three months later and worked as a barrister within a stone's throw of the Old Bailey until her arrest in June last year. </p> <p><b>Fraudster jailed over racing storm</b></p> <p>A former detective sergeant was yesterday jailed for 18 months at the Old Bailey for trying to extort money from the jockey Jamie Osborne. </p> <p>Judge David Paget told Robert Harrington, 58, his actions were \"a very serious perversion of all you stood for all your life\". </p> <p>Harrington, from Reading, Berkshire, was jailed for 18 months for obtaining \u00a3500 by deception from Mr Osborne and 18 months concurrently for corruption. He was found guilty of the charges last month. </p> <p>He had denied the charges saying he had been acting undercover as an informer for officers and had hoped to infiltrate a race-fixing scandal. </p> <p>The court was told that Harrington approached Mr Osborne after the jockey had been arrested in 1998 as part of an inquiry into a racing scandal after one of his rides was found to have been drugged. Although Mr Osborne was later eliminated from inquiries, Harrington persuaded him that he would be implicated unless he gave a police officer \u00a32,000. </p> <p>Mr Osborne, 31, told the court he was \"appalled\" and went to Scotland Yard. He was fitted with secret recording equipment to trap Harrington, who was acting as a private investigator. </p> <p>At the end of the trial, which lasted five weeks, Mr Osborne, who is now a trainer, said: \"I am very pleased that this unwelcome chapter in my life has ended. Many innocent people have been damaged by this case.\" </p> <p>Mr Osborne was arrested in January 1998 after Avanti Express was found to have been doped during a race in which he rode him in 1997. </p> <p>He sent ripples through the racing community as he revealed he had once been approached to pull up two favourites at the Cheltenham festival. </p> <p>Mr Osborne had turned it down because he wanted to make a career in racing, but said he thought a man, named in court as a criminal, had been behind the offer of \u00a320,000 which came when he was 19 and broke. </p> <p>The following day, Mr Osborne named veteran jockey Dermot Browne as the person who approached him with the bribe. </p> <p>Mr Browne contacted the defence team, claiming Mr Osborne had agreed the bribe. </p> <p>Mr Osborne was summoned back to court where he angrily denied the allegations, calling them \"absolute rubbish, a figment of someone's imagination\". </p> <p>She set up on her own in 1995, using the name Carol Winston, advising clients on business and conveyancing. Despite a drink-driving arrest, she was only detected when police looking through old warrants checked a list of barristers' names. </p> <p>Adrian Darbyshire, prosecuting, said that in 1986 she had threatened to tell the employer of a wealthy Wall Street banker, David Brown, that he had been a \"closet gay\" and had tried to get her involved in a \"bizarre relationship\" with him and another man, after he asked her to return $150,000 (\u00a3100,000) he had given her. The same year, she used a letter purporting to be from her then head of chambers, Stuart Bates QC, to try to obtain credit from Harrods. </p> <p>Patrice Wymore-Flynn, the widow of film star Errol Flynn, came from Jamaica to be a character witness, telling the court: \"She has been devoted to her friends and totally devoted to her profession. It is totally incomprehensible.\" </p> <p><b>Boy choked to death on grape</b></p> <p>A Cardiff inquest heard yesterday how Zachary Hemani, three, accidentally choked to death when he swallowed a whole grape. </p> <p>His mother, Karen Hemani, 30, struggled to dislodge the grape from her son's throat but when she failed he was taken to hospital, the inquest heard. Consultant Dirk Wilson treated the boy, and described how doctors battled to start him breathing again. He told the inquest: \"A standard grape would be enough to block the airway of a child.\" </p> <p>However, the boy had probably suffered severe brain damage, and died from multiple organ failure on January 3, two days later. He and his mother, who lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, had been visiting relatives in Swansea at the time. Coroner Lawrence Addicott recorded a verdict of accidental death. </p> <p>After the inquest, Mrs Hemani said: \"I would like to warn all mothers. </p> <p>\"You are so careful with everything else like sweets and nuts. You never dream that something as healthy as a grape could cause this.\" </p> <p><b>Breakfast show DJ's early start</b></p> <p>DJ Sara Cox breathed a sigh of relief yesterday after sneaking on air three days early for her first Radio 1 Breakfast Show. </p> <p>Cox was not due to go on air until Monday but her desire to complete her first show prompted her into asking Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt for the unscheduled debut. </p> <p>She said: \"I couldn't wait any longer. All week we've been doing shows as live but they've not been going out. It's quite hard to fake it, there's nothing like the thrill of knowing your friends and mum are listening, that's when the adrenaline gets going. </p> <p>\"For the past few months the point I've been looking forward to is the end of the first show, the handover to Simon Mayo at 9am. The hardest part was the first day and that's all over now,\" she added. </p> <p>Cox, 25, originally from Bolton, kicked off her show by playing Robbie Williams' Let Me Entertain You and held a phone in about bizarre initiation ceremonies. </p> <p>She joked to listeners: \"I've already flushed my own head down the loo to get it over with.\" </p> <p>After the show the former presenter for Channel 4's Big Breakfast said that the pressure to perform well on the first show would have been too much and she was keen to have a more low-key start.\"If I'd stuck to doing the first one on Monday it would have been too scary. It would have felt just too much like a test rather than a first show. Now I can relax over the weekend and I'm sure the fans of the show won't have minded.\" </p> <p>Cox, who lives with Leeroy Thornhill of dance band the Prodigy, said the anxiety of the new show had caused a sleepless night. \"I was just lying there with the adrenaline pumping. I could feel it coursing through me. Leeroy was still asleep and I just lay there next to him buzzing. I'd been dreaming that I was late.\" </p> <p><b>Slimy routhe to future of computing</b></p> <p>It may not be the most obvious, or pleasant, place to search, but slug slime could hold the key to building the next generation of super computers. </p> <p>Researchers in Edinburgh believe the mucus layer left by the slimy creatures may provide the answer for scientists looking to build faster and more powerful computers, run not by electronics but chemically. </p> <p>A team led by Christopher Viney at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh has discovered that slug slime contains a liquid crystalline layer with directional properties. It is the structure of the crystals in the slime laid down by a slug which allows another slug to \"read\" the direction its fellow shell-less mollusc, perhaps a potential mate, is heading. Professor Viney believes this may be fundamental in the race to develop chemical computers. </p> <p>\"The structure of the crystal in the slime has very little symmetry. This allows crystals pointing to the left to be distinguished from crystals pointing to the right - a property which would be essential to a chemical computer,\" he said. </p> <p>At present a computer uses magnetised particles, where moments point up or down, or switches, which are on or off, to store binary information, but compared with the potential of a chemical computer this is bulky and inefficient. </p> <p>\"Basically a desk-sized chemical computer would be as powerful as today's mainframes,\" said Prof Viney. </p> <p>Although it might seem a strange place in which to search for 21st-century advances, he said slug slime - which allows the creatures to both slide along rough surfaces and stick to smooth ones - might prove to have uses in other areas of science.

      "bodyText": "Barrister jailed for blackmail A barrister was jailed at the Old Bailey for a total of 15 months yesterday after pleading guilty to blackmailing a client and forgery to try to obtain credit from Harrods' bank. Judge David Paget told Carol Winston-Churchill, 47: \"Your career as a lawyer is now over. You are disgraced and destroyed.\" The court heard that Winston-Churchill,from Hampstead, north London, had been disbarred last month for unrelated matters of misconduct. The judge said the sentences would have been higher had the offences not been 14 years ago. Winston-Churchill was to stand trial in 1987 but fled to Jamaica. Despite two warrants she returned to Britain three months later and worked as a barrister within a stone's throw of the Old Bailey until her arrest in June last year. Fraudster jailed over racing storm A former detective sergeant was yesterday jailed for 18 months at the Old Bailey for trying to extort money from the jockey Jamie Osborne. Judge David Paget told Robert Harrington, 58, his actions were \"a very serious perversion of all you stood for all your life\". Harrington, from Reading, Berkshire, was jailed for 18 months for obtaining \u00a3500 by deception from Mr Osborne and 18 months concurrently for corruption. He was found guilty of the charges last month. He had denied the charges saying he had been acting undercover as an informer for officers and had hoped to infiltrate a race-fixing scandal. The court was told that Harrington approached Mr Osborne after the jockey had been arrested in 1998 as part of an inquiry into a racing scandal after one of his rides was found to have been drugged. Although Mr Osborne was later eliminated from inquiries, Harrington persuaded him that he would be implicated unless he gave a police officer \u00a32,000. Mr Osborne, 31, told the court he was \"appalled\" and went to Scotland Yard. He was fitted with secret recording equipment to trap Harrington, who was acting as a private investigator. At the end of the trial, which lasted five weeks, Mr Osborne, who is now a trainer, said: \"I am very pleased that this unwelcome chapter in my life has ended. Many innocent people have been damaged by this case.\" Mr Osborne was arrested in January 1998 after Avanti Express was found to have been doped during a race in which he rode him in 1997. He sent ripples through the racing community as he revealed he had once been approached to pull up two favourites at the Cheltenham festival. Mr Osborne had turned it down because he wanted to make a career in racing, but said he thought a man, named in court as a criminal, had been behind the offer of \u00a320,000 which came when he was 19 and broke. The following day, Mr Osborne named veteran jockey Dermot Browne as the person who approached him with the bribe. Mr Browne contacted the defence team, claiming Mr Osborne had agreed the bribe. Mr Osborne was summoned back to court where he angrily denied the allegations, calling them \"absolute rubbish, a figment of someone's imagination\". She set up on her own in 1995, using the name Carol Winston, advising clients on business and conveyancing. Despite a drink-driving arrest, she was only detected when police looking through old warrants checked a list of barristers' names. Adrian Darbyshire, prosecuting, said that in 1986 she had threatened to tell the employer of a wealthy Wall Street banker, David Brown, that he had been a \"closet gay\" and had tried to get her involved in a \"bizarre relationship\" with him and another man, after he asked her to return $150,000 (\u00a3100,000) he had given her. The same year, she used a letter purporting to be from her then head of chambers, Stuart Bates QC, to try to obtain credit from Harrods. Patrice Wymore-Flynn, the widow of film star Errol Flynn, came from Jamaica to be a character witness, telling the court: \"She has been devoted to her friends and totally devoted to her profession. It is totally incomprehensible.\" Boy choked to death on grape A Cardiff inquest heard yesterday how Zachary Hemani, three, accidentally choked to death when he swallowed a whole grape. His mother, Karen Hemani, 30, struggled to dislodge the grape from her son's throat but when she failed he was taken to hospital, the inquest heard. Consultant Dirk Wilson treated the boy, and described how doctors battled to start him breathing again. He told the inquest: \"A standard grape would be enough to block the airway of a child.\" However, the boy had probably suffered severe brain damage, and died from multiple organ failure on January 3, two days later. He and his mother, who lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, had been visiting relatives in Swansea at the time. Coroner Lawrence Addicott recorded a verdict of accidental death. After the inquest, Mrs Hemani said: \"I would like to warn all mothers. \"You are so careful with everything else like sweets and nuts. You never dream that something as healthy as a grape could cause this.\" Breakfast show DJ's early start DJ Sara Cox breathed a sigh of relief yesterday after sneaking on air three days early for her first Radio 1 Breakfast Show. Cox was not due to go on air until Monday but her desire to complete her first show prompted her into asking Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt for the unscheduled debut. She said: \"I couldn't wait any longer. All week we've been doing shows as live but they've not been going out. It's quite hard to fake it, there's nothing like the thrill of knowing your friends and mum are listening, that's when the adrenaline gets going. \"For the past few months the point I've been looking forward to is the end of the first show, the handover to Simon Mayo at 9am. The hardest part was the first day and that's all over now,\" she added. Cox, 25, originally from Bolton, kicked off her show by playing Robbie Williams' Let Me Entertain You and held a phone in about bizarre initiation ceremonies. She joked to listeners: \"I've already flushed my own head down the loo to get it over with.\" After the show the former presenter for Channel 4's Big Breakfast said that the pressure to perform well on the first show would have been too much and she was keen to have a more low-key start.\"If I'd stuck to doing the first one on Monday it would have been too scary. It would have felt just too much like a test rather than a first show. Now I can relax over the weekend and I'm sure the fans of the show won't have minded.\" Cox, who lives with Leeroy Thornhill of dance band the Prodigy, said the anxiety of the new show had caused a sleepless night. \"I was just lying there with the adrenaline pumping. I could feel it coursing through me. Leeroy was still asleep and I just lay there next to him buzzing. I'd been dreaming that I was late.\" Slimy routhe to future of computing It may not be the most obvious, or pleasant, place to search, but slug slime could hold the key to building the next generation of super computers. Researchers in Edinburgh believe the mucus layer left by the slimy creatures may provide the answer for scientists looking to build faster and more powerful computers, run not by electronics but chemically. A team led by Christopher Viney at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh has discovered that slug slime contains a liquid crystalline layer with directional properties. It is the structure of the crystals in the slime laid down by a slug which allows another slug to \"read\" the direction its fellow shell-less mollusc, perhaps a potential mate, is heading. Professor Viney believes this may be fundamental in the race to develop chemical computers. \"The structure of the crystal in the slime has very little symmetry. This allows crystals pointing to the left to be distinguished from crystals pointing to the right - a property which would be essential to a chemical computer,\" he said. At present a computer uses magnetised particles, where moments point up or down, or switches, which are on or off, to store binary information, but compared with the potential of a chemical computer this is bulky and inefficient. \"Basically a desk-sized chemical computer would be as powerful as today's mainframes,\" said Prof Viney. Although it might seem a strange place in which to search for 21st-century advances, he said slug slime - which allows the creatures to both slide along rough surfaces and stick to smooth ones - might prove to have uses in other areas of science. Gerard Seenan Warning as ticks move to the north Scientists in northern England have recorded a marked rise in the population of blood-sucking ticks that feed on sheep, grouse - and tourists. Ramblers and picnickers have been issued warnings by councils in coastal areas, where heathland and sea mist offer ideal breeding conditions for the spider-like Rhipicephalus bursa. Attack often goes unnoticed until the ticks swell from a pinhead to the size of a pea as they gorge on blood. Bites seldom cause more than irritation, but a few cases can give rise to Lyme disease, which has symptoms including rashes and swollen glands, leading to chronic tiredness and flu-like effects. Britain's first cases of Lyme disease were recorded some years ago in the New Forest, from where the insects began their march north. \"The ticks have become a problem because of the milder weather,\" said Mike Pratt of the North York Moors national park, where conservationists are also concerned about the parasites' predation on protected birds, such as the lapwing. \"Conservationists have found the young birds covered with ticks. A warm spring brings the things out of their hibernation, and they get breeding earlier.\" Martin Wainwright Gun guard gets nine life terms A former security guard was given nine life sentences at the Old Bailey yesterday after embarking on a shooting rampage as he drove away from police who had stopped him for an out-of-date tax disc. George Knights, 42, of Feltham, west London, sped through streets near his home last May, firing at bus passengers, motorists and police while ramming cars as he tried to escape. Judge Giles Forrester told him: \"I have no doubt that you pose an unusually high degree of risk. You clearly have an extensive knowledge not only of firearms but also of explosives. Your interest is an unhealthy one and amounts to an obsession. It is without exaggeration miraculous that no one was hit.\" Knights was convicted last month of 19 offences includ ing kidnap and possessing firearms and homemade grenades. As well as the life sentences, he was given a series of concurrent jail terms of up to eight years. The judge praised the \"bravery and calmness\" of motorists caught up in the car chase. Nicholas Wood, prosecuting, told the court that after police stopped Knights over the tax disc, he jumped out of his car and fired a self-loading pistol at them before driving off, still shooting. Swerving across the road to block a police Land Rover, he pulled out a Bushmaster assault rifle and shot the tyres out. He drove through back streets of Hanworth, stopped at a junction and tried to flag down a woman driver, shouting at her. She drove off around his car, hearing gunshots behind her. He then threatened a Dial-a-Ride bus, hijacked a BMW and took the driver of a Cavalier hostage before he was surrounded by armed police at his home. Police stormed the flat after hearing a gunshot and an explosion. Britains hurt in Laos explosion Four British tourists were among nine people injured in an explosion in Laos, the Foreign Office said yesterday. A British man was airlifted to hospital for emergency treatment and the other three, a woman and two men, were less seriously injured in the blast on Thursday night at a restaurant in the capital, Vientiane. A German and a Laotian were also seriously injured and other tourists were treated for cuts and lacerations. Witnesses reported that a grenade or bomb had been tossed from a motorcycle at the Kop Chai Deu restaurant. Ginny Stein, a reporter with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said: \"The scene was terrible.\" She said the airlifted Briton was hit in the chest by shrapnel. He was flown to neighbouring Thailand for treatment. The Foreign Office said that his injuries were not life threatening and that his family in Britain had been informed. The other three Britons were treated at the local Mahosot hospital. Lisa Thomlinson",

      "body": "<p>Government vets yesterday said there may be \"a real threat\" of cat owners catching tuberculosis from their pets as the disease takes greater hold on Britain's cattle and wildlife.</p> <p>One also warned of a greater risk of catching a strain now rare in humans from other sources if the infections in herds became more widespread.</p> <p>Health officials are already monitoring TB incidence in farm workers because of the increasing potential for them to get the disease but the Department of Health could not say last night whether surveillance of the wider population, including owners of 8m cats, might be considered.</p> <p>It also emerged last night that English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales, want more research on whether dogs and cats might play an important role in spreading TB.</p> <p>The vets insisted they were not being alarmist but their report on what is also a rare disease in cats seems to have caught civil servants by surprise. The RSPCA said there was no reason for pet lovers to be scared by the news.</p> <p>The TB involved is Mycobacterium bovis, which in the 1930s killed 2,500 people a year and infected 50,000. It is thought now to affect around 40 people a year and may only become obvious years after infection. It can be caught through unpasteurised milk or by those working closely with cattle through droplets from sick animals. Symptoms include fever and coughing, sometimes with blood, and weight loss.</p> <p>The strain was once common in humans. Now it affects mostly elderly people. TB in cattle, which affected only 143 farms 10 years ago, was confirmed in 515 herds in 1997. This rose to 740 in 1998 and provisional figures for last year suggest this rose to 872, although part of the increase is due to increased testing.</p> <p>The Department of Healthsaid: \"We are working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture to identify the potential for transmission to humans of all such diseases. Our view is M. bovis is a rare cause of TB in humans these days. We will continue looking at the risks.\"</p> <p>The latest alert comes in an article by six members of the veterinary laboratories agency, responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture, who found M. bovis in the bodies of a badger and three cats which died on a small holding in west Cornwall, during 1998. It was in an area affected by cattle TB although no cattle had been on the property for many years.</p> <p>They concluded: \"Despite rare occurence of M.bovis as a cause of TB in humans in recent years, M.bovis infection in cats may pose a real zoonotic threat to their keepers.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We do not have any concrete evidence that the infection in cats has spread from cattle, or badgers, or any other wildlife source. What we are saying is the strain in that infection is the same strain that has occured in wildlife, in badgers, and in cattle.\"</p> <p>The RSPCA said: \"There is not a high risk, and don't treat your cat any differently.\" But a spokeswoman said neutering male cats cut the risk of them catching both the feline version of HIV and TB.</p> <p>The government is involved in a controversial badger cull to established whether it is responsible for TB.</p> <p>Elaine King, of the National Federation of Badger Groups, said: \"This is typical of the way the Ministry of Agriculture moves the blame away from cattle at every opportunity. They are scapegoating badgers and other wildlife or domestic animals, while not considering whether infection could have come from cattle.\"</p> <p>The federation, together with other wildlife groups, has demanded checks on whether cats and dogs as well as wildlife might help spread bovine TB, and research into other possible factors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Government vets yesterday said there may be \"a real threat\" of cat owners catching tuberculosis from their pets as the disease takes greater hold on Britain's cattle and wildlife. One also warned of a greater risk of catching a strain now rare in humans from other sources if the infections in herds became more widespread. Health officials are already monitoring TB incidence in farm workers because of the increasing potential for them to get the disease but the Department of Health could not say last night whether surveillance of the wider population, including owners of 8m cats, might be considered. It also emerged last night that English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales, want more research on whether dogs and cats might play an important role in spreading TB. The vets insisted they were not being alarmist but their report on what is also a rare disease in cats seems to have caught civil servants by surprise. The RSPCA said there was no reason for pet lovers to be scared by the news. The TB involved is Mycobacterium bovis, which in the 1930s killed 2,500 people a year and infected 50,000. It is thought now to affect around 40 people a year and may only become obvious years after infection. It can be caught through unpasteurised milk or by those working closely with cattle through droplets from sick animals. Symptoms include fever and coughing, sometimes with blood, and weight loss. The strain was once common in humans. Now it affects mostly elderly people. TB in cattle, which affected only 143 farms 10 years ago, was confirmed in 515 herds in 1997. This rose to 740 in 1998 and provisional figures for last year suggest this rose to 872, although part of the increase is due to increased testing. The Department of Healthsaid: \"We are working closely with the Ministry of Agriculture to identify the potential for transmission to humans of all such diseases. Our view is M. bovis is a rare cause of TB in humans these days. We will continue looking at the risks.\" The latest alert comes in an article by six members of the veterinary laboratories agency, responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture, who found M. bovis in the bodies of a badger and three cats which died on a small holding in west Cornwall, during 1998. It was in an area affected by cattle TB although no cattle had been on the property for many years. They concluded: \"Despite rare occurence of M.bovis as a cause of TB in humans in recent years, M.bovis infection in cats may pose a real zoonotic threat to their keepers.\" He said: \"We do not have any concrete evidence that the infection in cats has spread from cattle, or badgers, or any other wildlife source. What we are saying is the strain in that infection is the same strain that has occured in wildlife, in badgers, and in cattle.\" The RSPCA said: \"There is not a high risk, and don't treat your cat any differently.\" But a spokeswoman said neutering male cats cut the risk of them catching both the feline version of HIV and TB. The government is involved in a controversial badger cull to established whether it is responsible for TB. Elaine King, of the National Federation of Badger Groups, said: \"This is typical of the way the Ministry of Agriculture moves the blame away from cattle at every opportunity. They are scapegoating badgers and other wildlife or domestic animals, while not considering whether infection could have come from cattle.\" The federation, together with other wildlife groups, has demanded checks on whether cats and dogs as well as wildlife might help spread bovine TB, and research into other possible factors.",

      "body": "<p>Ministers are preparing to unveil a multibillion pound neighbourhood renewal programme aimed at closing the widening gap between the levels of crime, unemployment, mortality, skills in Britain's 44 poorest districts and the rest of the country.</p> <p>The districts are primarily in the inner cities, raning from Britain's poorest borough, Tower Hamlets in east London, to Manningham in Bradford.</p> <p>In what will be the culmination of one of the most exhaustive studies into social deprivation and regenerative strategy, the Social Exclusion Unit will publish shortly its report National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal.</p> <p>The report will form the central policy plank for the government in its attempts to retrieve the country's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Some 18 separate studies have examined almost every aspect of community life and have assessed why a succession of local and central government departments have failed to tackle the drift of the dispossessed sections of society.</p> <p>The strategy will allow ministers to deliver what Tony Blair has called \"joined up government\" with the exclusion unit criticising the piecemeal approach to local problems and instead suggesting more devolved power to allow locally-led solutions.</p> <p>Among those solutions under consideration by ministers are giving the poorest wards, or estates individual improvement targets in an effort to provide proposed new individual neighbourhood managers incentives to raise the ambitions of communities.</p> <p>Measures to be unveiled as part of the renewal programme will include more uniformed neighbourhood wardens on estates, a revival of inner city shopping, a new role for the Post Office in delivering banking and a national neighbourhood renewal centre to train up a generation of social entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Among the institutions facing change are schools, which in poor areas will be transformed from 9am to 3pm services to wide-reaching community centres offering adult learning, extracurricular activities, health advice, parental guidance and sports and arts facilities outside traditional school hours. Each school will be asked to provide three hours extra study support per week.</p> <p>The report also calls for a crackdown on anti-social neighbours, including placing persistent offenders in special residential homes.</p> <p>Some social landlords recorded up to 285 complaints per 1,000 tenancies a year about the behaviour of neighbours and 75% of them considered this to be a serious problem.</p> <p>Although the report admits its researches have revealed a huge information gap, research compiled since November 1998 from 18 separate policy action teams working under the eye of the SEU, has convinced ministers that the poorest estates have been falling behind.</p> <p>Forty per cent of crime takes place in just 10% of areas and 10% of residents of inner-city areas are burgled once or more in a year - double the rate elsewhere. Anti-social behaviour is perceived by residents to be twice as high in deprived areas than nationally. Mortality rates are also a third higher than the national average.</p> <p>The research has found a signigicant rump of 15 local au thority districts with very low employment rates of around 61.75% or below.</p> <p>The renewal programme will propose halving the gap in unemployment between the 44 poorest districts and the remainder of the country.</p> <p>Some of the recommendations including the delivery proposals - with supervision placed in the hands of a strengthened network of gov ernment offices in the eight regions, a proposal which will prove controversial.</p> <p>But the report found: \"No one has had responsibility for looking at neighbourhood renewal across the board either nationally or at a local level.</p> <p>\"There has been too little coordination at all levels of government and too many perverse incentives.</p> <p>\"Resources have often been inadequate. The wrong targets have been set. Some public organisations have consistently failed to provide an effective service. Regeneration programmes have failed to influence mainstream services.\"</p> <p>Another plank of the report will be the need to devolve power down to local neighbourhoods - much smaller areas than those covered by metropolitan authorities.</p> <p>Ministers want to provide communities with unprecedented levels of information via a series of \"neighbourhood statistics\", which would allow comparisons of comparable areas in terms of joblessness rates, school staying-on rates and exam results, crime and community facilities. Such information would be freely available in libraries and on the internet.</p> <p>One source said: \"This way any council ward in the country would be able to compare itself with the one next door or with the national average\".</p> <p>More statistical information will also allow the government to set specific improvement targets for individual areas rather than simply measuring them against national averages.</p> <p>\"This extra information and evidence will be a key tool for what is going on,\" said the source. \"We can use it as a battering ram for improvement.\"</p> <p>Already the Cabinet Office minister, Lord Falconer, one of the prime minister's closest friends, has been drafted into the Department of the Environment to coordinate regional strategy. This follows a damning report on disjointed government initiatives from the performance and innovation unit in the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>The national neighbourhood renewal strategy will be the culmination of 18 months work by the SEU following the launch of a study programme by Mr Blair.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, is fighting for more cash from the Treasury in the forthcoming comprhensive spending review to drive forward his New Deal for Communities programme.</p> <p>An \u00a3800m pilot programme in 17 \"pathfinder\"districts was launched 18 months ago - but the deputy prime minister's Department of the Environment is hoping that many other areas will soon be in a position to bid for funds.</p> <p>Significantly, these pilot schemes - in areas with 2,000 to 5,000 people - are driven by local community groups rather than by town halls, although most are working in partnership with local authorities.</p> <p>But ministers have been keen to encourage local partnerships and \"active citizens\" - rather than local councilloors - with a new breed of community enterprises.</p> <p>The Social Exclusion Unit has talked of encouraging \"dynamic local leaders with the power and resources to turn their community around\".</p> <p>With this in mind, the pathfinder schemes were labelled a \"major shift of power and responsibility down to the neighbourhood level\".</p> <p><b>Scale of the problems in the poorest areas and how they might be tackled</b></p> <p><b> Jobs</b></p> <p>Fifteen local authority districts, mostly in major cities although some are former coalfields or seaside towns, have very low employment rates of 61.75% or below - more than 10 percentage points below the national average</p> <p>Unemployment rates in the 100 worst of the country's 11,000 wards were up to 25 percentage points higher than average, with unemployment in the worst ward at up to 30%. In short, you are up to six times more likely to be unemployed in one of these 100 wards.</p> <p>Recommendations include personal advisers, more outreach work, improvement to personal skills for the unemployed, and changes to benefit structure.</p> <p><b> Skills</b></p> <p>Too many adults have a poor experience of compulsory education, and are disinclined ever to learn again. Adult education and training is often hard to get to, intimidating or otherwise difficult for the socially disadvantaged.</p> <p>Solutions include neighbourhood learning centres, more community generated training, and setting learning targets for communities</p> <p><b> Enterprise</b></p> <p>No national strategy exists for supporting enterprise in poor areas; business support is patchy. People in deprived areas find it difficult to raise capital. Self-employment is undervalued as a form of work.</p> <p>A small business service should be set up to encourage starters, and the importance of enterprise in regeneration must be recognised by regional development agencies .</p> <p><b> Housing management</b></p> <p>Effective management in disadvantaged areas requires a wide range of services. Being an advocate for an estate and acting as a catalyst to pull in other services is as important as ensuring repairs on time.</p> <p>Extensive decentralisation to local estate offices remains rare. Drawing up a clear and enforceable agreement about the roles of tenants and housing managers is essential.</p> <p><b> Neighbourhood wardens</b></p> <p>Crime is a major problem: 40%of crime is in 10%of areas. One in 10 inner city residents is burgled once or more in a year - double that elsewhere. Half of crime victims are repeat victims, accounting for 81% of recorded crime.</p> <p>Estate wardens should not be given new powers, and councils and local police should have joint accountability for outcomes of warden schemes.</p> <p><b> Unpopular housing</b></p> <p>Six out of 10 English councils report low demand or unpopular housing stock. Social landlords report 8% (around 89,500) of their homes are unpopular. Such housing dislike and neighbourhood abandonment is increasing in public and private sectors.</p> <p><b> Shopping</b></p> <p>As superstores have gone from 457 in 1986 to 1,102 by 1997, across the country each day eight independent shops disappeared between 1986 and 1996, a fall overall of almost 40% between 1986 and 1997.</p> <p>A community of 4,000 households each spending on average \u00a366 per week would need to spend10% at the local shop, and its turnover would be \u00a327,500 per week, more than \u00a31m a year, indicating survival is possible. Such shops need better stocks and display, and some should be mobile.</p> <p><b> Young people</b></p> <p>Young people face a mix of problems - from poverty and unemployment to crime and poor health - but have been failed by fragmented services. At all levels including government, there is no \"big picture\" and, far from targeting the poorest, the state spends 14% less than average on young people in the most deprived areas.</p> <p>The report recommends a youth unit to push a clearer strategy, led by at least two ministers for youth, and more coordination at local level. Fo cus should switch from crisis response to prevention.</p> <p><b> Learning lessons</b></p> <p>Community leaders in deprived areas were found to lack support and encouragement, while national policy makers had no personal experience of the problems.</p> <p>There should be funding and training for ocal people to take the lead as \"social entrepreneurs\", improved training for local professionals in the challenges of poor neighbourhoods, and secondments for civil servants to disadvantaged areas. A development fund should give small grants to community groups for \"social entrepreneurial activity\".</p> <p><b> Community self-help</b></p> <p>Absence of strong communities can see social decay matched by physical decay, lack of hope, an exodus and, eventually, a \"point of no return\". A government commitment to supporting self-help was recommended, plus more involvement of churches and other faith communities in regeneration; reforming benefit rules that impede voluntary work; and more mentoring to provide role models for young people.</p> <p><b> Arts and sport</b></p> <p>Arts and sport can help poor communities, improving self-esteem, mental well-being and children's development. However, programmes focused on providers rather than users and were funded short-term.</p> <p>It was recommended leisure activities get a bigger role in community regeneration, with more help from local authorities and from government funding for local regeneration. Schools should be available outside hours, and the lottery could fund community venues.</p> <p><b> Financial services</b></p> <p>This examined credit unions and banks, post offices and insurance. More than 2m adults, mostly jobless and on benefits, use no services. High crime may make insurance unaffordable, and banks have cut branches, leaving deprived neighbourhoods unserved. Some households cannot provide identity documents to open accounts.</p> <p>Credit unions should be helped, as should \"insurance with rent\" schemes to cover poorer homes. Banks and building societies should be more accessible to poorer customers.</p> <p><b> Anti-social behaviour</b></p> <p>This was found to be a widespread and increasing problem, and twice as high in deprived neighbourhoods as nationally - ranging from dropping litter to serious harassment. It destroys lives and shatters communities. However, no one agency or government department is tackling the problem, making action ineffective.</p> <p>The report recommends given the problem a high priority and better coordination at all levels; improved efforts at prevention and more use of powers - including anti-social behaviour orders and eviction. Zero tolerance for racial harassment.</p> <p><b> Information technology</b></p> <p>There is the danger of a digital divide. Lack of access reinforces disadvantage, slows progress at school, and blocks the path into the job market. In some estates, less than 50% of households have a phone, and computer ownership is lower still.</p> <p>By 2002, each neighbourhood should have at least one community IT facility, all communities to have access to electronically delivered public services by 2008. And telecoms operators should offer more flexible tariffss with Oftel ensuring the poorest are not priced out of phone services.</p> <p><b> Schools plus</b></p> <p>This examined ways to extend use of schools for children and the wider community -breakfast clubs, homework centres and summercommunity activities. It set a target of three hours of extracurricular activities a week for pupils; extended hours at some schools to allow study support; and one-stop family support centres to serve pupils and their families. Stronger links were recommended between schools and communities, with \"schools plus\" teams to help parental and community involvement. Cash to promote supplementary and mother tongue schools. Young people to have more input, including through a youth consultation website.</p> <p><b> Joining it up locally</b></p> <p>Due shortly, this is expected to call for coordination between agencies in poor neighbourhoods. It could pave the way for central coordination, bypassing local authorities.</p> <p><b> Better information</b></p> <p>Also due shortly, this is expected to call for detailed information on small neighbourhoods of some 2,000 households based on council wards. Data, to be available locally in public libraries and on the internet, to include employment rates, school staying-on rates and levels of government spending.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers are preparing to unveil a multibillion pound neighbourhood renewal programme aimed at closing the widening gap between the levels of crime, unemployment, mortality, skills in Britain's 44 poorest districts and the rest of the country. The districts are primarily in the inner cities, raning from Britain's poorest borough, Tower Hamlets in east London, to Manningham in Bradford. In what will be the culmination of one of the most exhaustive studies into social deprivation and regenerative strategy, the Social Exclusion Unit will publish shortly its report National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal. The report will form the central policy plank for the government in its attempts to retrieve the country's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Some 18 separate studies have examined almost every aspect of community life and have assessed why a succession of local and central government departments have failed to tackle the drift of the dispossessed sections of society. The strategy will allow ministers to deliver what Tony Blair has called \"joined up government\" with the exclusion unit criticising the piecemeal approach to local problems and instead suggesting more devolved power to allow locally-led solutions. Among those solutions under consideration by ministers are giving the poorest wards, or estates individual improvement targets in an effort to provide proposed new individual neighbourhood managers incentives to raise the ambitions of communities. Measures to be unveiled as part of the renewal programme will include more uniformed neighbourhood wardens on estates, a revival of inner city shopping, a new role for the Post Office in delivering banking and a national neighbourhood renewal centre to train up a generation of social entrepreneurs. Among the institutions facing change are schools, which in poor areas will be transformed from 9am to 3pm services to wide-reaching community centres offering adult learning, extracurricular activities, health advice, parental guidance and sports and arts facilities outside traditional school hours. Each school will be asked to provide three hours extra study support per week. The report also calls for a crackdown on anti-social neighbours, including placing persistent offenders in special residential homes. Some social landlords recorded up to 285 complaints per 1,000 tenancies a year about the behaviour of neighbours and 75% of them considered this to be a serious problem. Although the report admits its researches have revealed a huge information gap, research compiled since November 1998 from 18 separate policy action teams working under the eye of the SEU, has convinced ministers that the poorest estates have been falling behind. Forty per cent of crime takes place in just 10% of areas and 10% of residents of inner-city areas are burgled once or more in a year - double the rate elsewhere. Anti-social behaviour is perceived by residents to be twice as high in deprived areas than nationally. Mortality rates are also a third higher than the national average. The research has found a signigicant rump of 15 local au thority districts with very low employment rates of around 61.75% or below. The renewal programme will propose halving the gap in unemployment between the 44 poorest districts and the remainder of the country. Some of the recommendations including the delivery proposals - with supervision placed in the hands of a strengthened network of gov ernment offices in the eight regions, a proposal which will prove controversial. But the report found: \"No one has had responsibility for looking at neighbourhood renewal across the board either nationally or at a local level. \"There has been too little coordination at all levels of government and too many perverse incentives. \"Resources have often been inadequate. The wrong targets have been set. Some public organisations have consistently failed to provide an effective service. Regeneration programmes have failed to influence mainstream services.\" Another plank of the report will be the need to devolve power down to local neighbourhoods - much smaller areas than those covered by metropolitan authorities. Ministers want to provide communities with unprecedented levels of information via a series of \"neighbourhood statistics\", which would allow comparisons of comparable areas in terms of joblessness rates, school staying-on rates and exam results, crime and community facilities. Such information would be freely available in libraries and on the internet. One source said: \"This way any council ward in the country would be able to compare itself with the one next door or with the national average\". More statistical information will also allow the government to set specific improvement targets for individual areas rather than simply measuring them against national averages. \"This extra information and evidence will be a key tool for what is going on,\" said the source. \"We can use it as a battering ram for improvement.\" Already the Cabinet Office minister, Lord Falconer, one of the prime minister's closest friends, has been drafted into the Department of the Environment to coordinate regional strategy. This follows a damning report on disjointed government initiatives from the performance and innovation unit in the Cabinet Office. The national neighbourhood renewal strategy will be the culmination of 18 months work by the SEU following the launch of a study programme by Mr Blair. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, is fighting for more cash from the Treasury in the forthcoming comprhensive spending review to drive forward his New Deal for Communities programme. An \u00a3800m pilot programme in 17 \"pathfinder\"districts was launched 18 months ago - but the deputy prime minister's Department of the Environment is hoping that many other areas will soon be in a position to bid for funds. Significantly, these pilot schemes - in areas with 2,000 to 5,000 people - are driven by local community groups rather than by town halls, although most are working in partnership with local authorities. But ministers have been keen to encourage local partnerships and \"active citizens\" - rather than local councilloors - with a new breed of community enterprises. The Social Exclusion Unit has talked of encouraging \"dynamic local leaders with the power and resources to turn their community around\". With this in mind, the pathfinder schemes were labelled a \"major shift of power and responsibility down to the neighbourhood level\". Scale of the problems in the poorest areas and how they might be tackled Jobs Fifteen local authority districts, mostly in major cities although some are former coalfields or seaside towns, have very low employment rates of 61.75% or below - more than 10 percentage points below the national average Unemployment rates in the 100 worst of the country's 11,000 wards were up to 25 percentage points higher than average, with unemployment in the worst ward at up to 30%. In short, you are up to six times more likely to be unemployed in one of these 100 wards. Recommendations include personal advisers, more outreach work, improvement to personal skills for the unemployed, and changes to benefit structure. Skills Too many adults have a poor experience of compulsory education, and are disinclined ever to learn again. Adult education and training is often hard to get to, intimidating or otherwise difficult for the socially disadvantaged. Solutions include neighbourhood learning centres, more community generated training, and setting learning targets for communities Enterprise No national strategy exists for supporting enterprise in poor areas; business support is patchy. People in deprived areas find it difficult to raise capital. Self-employment is undervalued as a form of work. A small business service should be set up to encourage starters, and the importance of enterprise in regeneration must be recognised by regional development agencies . Housing management Effective management in disadvantaged areas requires a wide range of services. Being an advocate for an estate and acting as a catalyst to pull in other services is as important as ensuring repairs on time. Extensive decentralisation to local estate offices remains rare. Drawing up a clear and enforceable agreement about the roles of tenants and housing managers is essential. Neighbourhood wardens Crime is a major problem: 40%of crime is in 10%of areas. One in 10 inner city residents is burgled once or more in a year - double that elsewhere. Half of crime victims are repeat victims, accounting for 81% of recorded crime. Estate wardens should not be given new powers, and councils and local police should have joint accountability for outcomes of warden schemes. Unpopular housing Six out of 10 English councils report low demand or unpopular housing stock. Social landlords report 8% (around 89,500) of their homes are unpopular. Such housing dislike and neighbourhood abandonment is increasing in public and private sectors. Shopping As superstores have gone from 457 in 1986 to 1,102 by 1997, across the country each day eight independent shops disappeared between 1986 and 1996, a fall overall of almost 40% between 1986 and 1997. A community of 4,000 households each spending on average \u00a366 per week would need to spend10% at the local shop, and its turnover would be \u00a327,500 per week, more than \u00a31m a year, indicating survival is possible. Such shops need better stocks and display, and some should be mobile. Young people Young people face a mix of problems - from poverty and unemployment to crime and poor health - but have been failed by fragmented services. At all levels including government, there is no \"big picture\" and, far from targeting the poorest, the state spends 14% less than average on young people in the most deprived areas. The report recommends a youth unit to push a clearer strategy, led by at least two ministers for youth, and more coordination at local level. Fo cus should switch from crisis response to prevention. Learning lessons Community leaders in deprived areas were found to lack support and encouragement, while national policy makers had no personal experience of the problems. There should be funding and training for ocal people to take the lead as \"social entrepreneurs\", improved training for local professionals in the challenges of poor neighbourhoods, and secondments for civil servants to disadvantaged areas. A development fund should give small grants to community groups for \"social entrepreneurial activity\". Community self-help Absence of strong communities can see social decay matched by physical decay, lack of hope, an exodus and, eventually, a \"point of no return\". A government commitment to supporting self-help was recommended, plus more involvement of churches and other faith communities in regeneration; reforming benefit rules that impede voluntary work; and more mentoring to provide role models for young people. Arts and sport Arts and sport can help poor communities, improving self-esteem, mental well-being and children's development. However, programmes focused on providers rather than users and were funded short-term. It was recommended leisure activities get a bigger role in community regeneration, with more help from local authorities and from government funding for local regeneration. Schools should be available outside hours, and the lottery could fund community venues. Financial services This examined credit unions and banks, post offices and insurance. More than 2m adults, mostly jobless and on benefits, use no services. High crime may make insurance unaffordable, and banks have cut branches, leaving deprived neighbourhoods unserved. Some households cannot provide identity documents to open accounts. Credit unions should be helped, as should \"insurance with rent\" schemes to cover poorer homes. Banks and building societies should be more accessible to poorer customers. Anti-social behaviour This was found to be a widespread and increasing problem, and twice as high in deprived neighbourhoods as nationally - ranging from dropping litter to serious harassment. It destroys lives and shatters communities. However, no one agency or government department is tackling the problem, making action ineffective. The report recommends given the problem a high priority and better coordination at all levels; improved efforts at prevention and more use of powers - including anti-social behaviour orders and eviction. Zero tolerance for racial harassment. Information technology There is the danger of a digital divide. Lack of access reinforces disadvantage, slows progress at school, and blocks the path into the job market. In some estates, less than 50% of households have a phone, and computer ownership is lower still. By 2002, each neighbourhood should have at least one community IT facility, all communities to have access to electronically delivered public services by 2008. And telecoms operators should offer more flexible tariffss with Oftel ensuring the poorest are not priced out of phone services. Schools plus This examined ways to extend use of schools for children and the wider community -breakfast clubs, homework centres and summercommunity activities. It set a target of three hours of extracurricular activities a week for pupils; extended hours at some schools to allow study support; and one-stop family support centres to serve pupils and their families. Stronger links were recommended between schools and communities, with \"schools plus\" teams to help parental and community involvement. Cash to promote supplementary and mother tongue schools. Young people to have more input, including through a youth consultation website. Joining it up locally Due shortly, this is expected to call for coordination between agencies in poor neighbourhoods. It could pave the way for central coordination, bypassing local authorities. Better information Also due shortly, this is expected to call for detailed information on small neighbourhoods of some 2,000 households based on council wards. Data, to be available locally in public libraries and on the internet, to include employment rates, school staying-on rates and levels of government spending.",

      "bodyText": "The row over the appointment of 33 new working peers intensified last night when Tony Blair faced calls from his own side to \"clean up\" the system, while Lady Jay, leader of the House of Lords, described the nomination of the Tory treasurer and donor Michael Ashcroft as \"stinking\". Lady Jay went on the offensive amid Conservative claims that Mr Blair's nominees were \"cronies\" and as senior Labour backbenchers expressed strong reservations over the extent of prime ministerial patronage. It was a day of attack and counter-blast over the appointment of 20 Labour, nine Liberal Democrat and four Conservative peers. Mr Ashcroft, recommended by William Hague, the Tory leader, made it on to the list only after agreeing to unprecedented conditions that he move back from Florida to become a permanent resident in Britain this year, before taking up his seat. On BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Lady Jay was asked why Mr Blair's nominations included former donors to the Labour party as well as hereditary peers who had previously lost their right to sit in the house, in a move that \"rather stinks\" of an era Mr Blair had promised to end. Demanding to know which of Mr Blair's nominees were \"stinking\", she insisted that Labour donors on the list were not in the same league as Mr Ashcroft, adding: \"The stinking nomination is, if you want to put it in those terms, from Mr Hague.\" Peter Bradley, Labour MP for the Wrekin, last night wrote to Mr Hague demanding answers to 16 questions as to how the nomination came about. Earlier, Lord Cranborne, former leader of the Conservatives in the Lords, attacked the nomination of Mr Ashcroft as \"an affront to the dignity and standing\" of parliament. But Lord Strathclyde, current Tory leader in the Lords, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the row over Mr Ashcroft's peerage was a smokescreen to draw attention away from the prime minister's other appointments as working peers, which he claimed were an attempt to pack the House of Lords with his own supporters. Labour unease over the appointments was clear yesterday, although the government claims that they are necessary to move towards a \"broad balance\" in the Lords - to end Tory dominance and reflect each party's share of the vote at the last election. Anthony Wright, Labour MP for Cannock Chase and chairman of the all-party constitutional and parliamentary affairs committee, said the controversy underlined the need for ministers to press ahead with the second stage of Lords reform. He called for the link between the honours system and service in the second chamber to be broken to avoid further \"contamination\", as recommended this year by the royal commission on Lords reform, chaired by former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Wakeham. His comments echoed widespread concern that the government has stalled on Lords reform after removing most of the hereditary peers. Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, denounced the appointments as a \"throwback 500 years to when the king nominated all the peers\".",

At a special all-day cabinet meeting at Chequers, ministers backed an election battleplan concentrating on: employment opportunities for all; tackling child poverty through help for families; strong public services; security in retirement; support for business. The blueprint, outlined by Gordon Brown, made no specific policy recommendations, but sources said the intention was to prevent the Conservatives from driving a wedge between those on low incomes and middle-class voters. The chancellor warned that Labour would be falling into a Tory trap if it thought different policies were needed for its core vote than for the rest of the country. Mr Blair, keen to show that Labour would have a radical agenda for a second term, is planning an updated version of Labour's 1997 pledge card - the easy-to-remember \"five early pledges\" that helped clinch his election landslide. But the final list, which will be unveiled nearer the probable election date of May or June 2001, is likely to be more \"aspirational\" and less specific than in 1997. A news blackout was being imposed on yesterday's session. But key Blair aides, led by David Miliband, head of the Downing Street policy unit and his \"second term\" team, have been canvassing ideas among party analysts and friendly thinktanks such as Demos and the Institute for Public Policy Research. The pledge card - with its commitments on the economy (including no rise in income tax rates), health, education, crime and jobs - was judged a campaign success in 1997. But some of the more specific pledges, notably to cut the NHS waiting list to 100,000 below the Tory figure, have proved hard and costly to fulfil. Pollsters record growing voter disappointment over public services, especially health and public transport. Mr Brown, who is in charge of the general election campaign and is determined not to let William Hague force the government into a false choice, said Labour should capitalise on the big boost to health spending over the next four years announced in the Budget by campaigning on the slogan of \"strong public services for the many, not tax cuts for the few\". Mr Hague has put a tax-cutting guarantee at the heart of his election campaign, whereas both Labour and the Liberal Democrats believe voters want any extra money to be spent on better services. Mr Blair is said to be taking personal charge of NHS reform, which Alan Milburn is starting to implement with tough decisions. The first test comes in the elections for councils and London mayor on May 4. Labour's chances of repeating its 1997 landslide will be severely damaged if the party focuses exclusively on its heartland vote, Mr Brown told colleagues yesterday. Some, including David Blunkett, Chris Smith and Robin Cook, feel that Mr Brown has not done enough to court Labour's core voters - who could abstain with devastating results in Labour marginals. Others, such as John Prescott, believe that the message has been tailored too much to first-time middle-class voters - the so-called middle England vote.

      "body": "<p> Earlier this week, Britain scored a major cultural triumph. We really put those Yanks in the shade. But don't take my word for it. Consider the Sun's splash headline \"Brits Cained 'Em!\" Or the Daily Mail's \"All Things Brit and Beautiful\". Or the London Evening Standard's \"Brits Storm the Oscars\", a headline supported with a photograph of Brit Michael Caine and American Kevin Spacey waving statuettes. </p> <p>But the patriotic hoopla didn't end there. In the Commons, Tom Clarke served up a nice fat lob for the film minister to smash away. \"Does my honourable friend agree that she should be beaming with pride at last night's brilliant British successes in the Oscars?\" Unsurprisingly, film minister Janet Anderson did agree. \"We have a pool of excellent skills and talent here, and it is no wonder that more and more people want to make their films in Britain.\" </p> <p>But the truth behind this misplaced flag-waving is that the Brits did not storm the Oscars. Oscar night was for the most part an evening of American triumphs in which a few token Brits got dragged along on the US's coattails, as happens year after year. The Cider House Rules, in which Michael Caine plays an abortionist, is based on an American novel, directed by an American, and produced in the US with mostly American actors. American Beauty, though winningly directed by a Briton, was written by an American, starred a cast of marvellous mostly American actors, and was produced with US money. Moreover, the film's central theme - the spiritual rebirth of a suburban man and wife in Nowheresville, USA - was surely tailored to US sensibilities. </p> <p>Patriots will reply that there were some genuinely British triumphs at the Academy Awards. It is true that a British film won the best documentary award, but this is, for good or ill, a marginal Oscar. It is also true that Phil Collins won an award for best song, but when a mawkish tune for a Disney movie becomes an example of a nation's cultural renaissance, it's time to put the Union Jacks back in mothballs. </p> <p>In the Commons, Anderson pointed to another supposed triumph: Mike Leigh's Gilbert and Sullivan film Topsy-Turvy won two minor awards. But this is an example of Hollywood marginalising British culture. Oscars get dished out to British films mostly when they are costume dramas that support the heritage industry. No British films about the way we live now, depicting our lives in ways we might recognise, were honoured at the Academy Awards. Nor will they be: the US doesn't understand, nor care much about, modern Britain. </p> <p>Since 1990, British films, actors and film-makers have won 21% of all the major Oscars and 18% of all the major prizes at Cannes. These are not extraordinary figures for a small developed nation that has an entr\u00e9e into the vast US film production market because of the simple fact that its citizens speak English. But year after year, with mounting desperation and declining plausibility, papers and the government cite the Oscars as a barometer of our cultural achievement. </p> <p>British films that step outside heritage movie-making hardly ever get nominated. Even The Full Monty or Secrets and Lies, both critically and popularly successful abroad, were ignored by the academy. Think of, say, Lynne Ramsey's marvellously humane Ratcatcher, set in the Glasgow slums in the 70s, or Michael Winterbottom's Wonderland, which, for all its failings, strove passionately to depict present-day London in all its seedy glamour, and thus alienated it from being appreciated by Americans. These films, visually and perhaps even in terms of their spoken language, are too intrinsically foreign for the academy to comprehend, let alone reward with statuettes. </p> <p>When the Hollywood academy looks at Britain, it sees the country with John Major's eyes, the rose-tinted eyes of a nostalgist hankering after the return of a never-never land of warm beer and cricket on village greens, perhaps with a bit of doublet and hose, iambic pentameter and Dickensian sentimentality thrown in for good measure. It does not see Britain in the terms that Tony Blair described this week, a Britain of many communities and a country of several nations. </p> <p>Here Blair was launching a new patriotism, one that is problematic for the reasons argued by Norman Davies in his recent book, The Isles: the UK is fracturing and our national identity can hardly be expressed in works of art, since we don't have one. That is why so many of the genuinely good British films about this modern country retreat into the shattered communities of a fractured nation- the Glasgow slums, the London underbelly, the Sheffield unemployed. </p> <p> Today the new Film Council starts its work under the chairmanship of Alan Parker. This body is charged with distributing \u00a3150m in grant in aid and lottery funding over three years. The council's brief is to help develop a sustainable UK film industry, which, given the history of lottery funding for British film since 1996, is quite a challenge. Get Real, Babymother, Keep The Aspidistra Fly ing, Downtime, Crimetime - these were some of the dreadful films that lottery punters have supported, and hardly anybody wanted to see. When Parker was appointed to the chair of the British Film Institute three years ago, he reckoned one of the big issues was \"whether you can go to your local multiplex and see a British film made by a British film-maker\". No amount of Oscar \"triumphs\" of the kind that took place in California on Sunday night will make that possible. </p> <p>But what sort of films will Parker's council be funding? More that are terrible whatever your standards? More that win awards for best make-up and show Britain as it never was for American philistines and British conservatives? Films that speak only to tiny demographics? Or maybe he should just plough the money into Hollywood, and thus help facilitate the annual farce by means of which Britons get a fix of misplaced patriotic sentiment. </p> <p>Perhaps, instead, Parker might achieve something far more difficult and desirable: to help us to see on screen a Britain that is something more than a 51st state, to make us watch something less nostalgic than another busts-and-bustles costume drama, and, most difficult of all, to encourage us to see something that shows that Britain is not splintering into small groups that are hardly on speaking terms. Then we might have something to celebrate.</p>",

For while the full-length story ballets have proved a golden milch cow for Houston, he is aware that some may see the form as compromised, even defunct. </p> <p>The 20th century had an ambivalent relationship with the story ballet. The leisurely, fairy-tale conventions of the 19th-century classics in which a Swan Queen would mime in elaborate gestures that \"yonder lies the lake of my mother's tears\" are no longer viable models. And it has been hard for choreographers to find new ones. </p> <p>Some of the greatest full-length ballets of the last half century have been led by scores, notably Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet and Cinderella. These are lyric flights of the imagination that allow choreographers to give rein to their traditional art, yet they have a more contemporary edge than the historic scores of Tchaikovsky. (Though AMP's Matthew Bourne has proved that it is possible, with radical reinterpretation, to make even these new again.) </p> <p>But there is only one Prokofiev, and few composers write suitable music for full-length story ballets: John McCabe, who provided the scores for David Bintley's Edward II and Arthur, sound-paints dramatic effects with dash and vividness, but his music is typical in its lack of dance impulse and variety. </p> <p>Literature, more than music, has been the major source of inspiration in recent decades, with choreo-graphers shamelessly raiding their libraries in search of stories. Cyrano, Far From the Madding Crowd and Great Expectations are among the many classics to have been set on pointe. But even though their creators have updated their narrative methods beyond the pantomime of the 19th century they've rarely overcome the fact that dance remains stubbornly bad at detailed description and analysis. All too often complex textual scenarios get reduced to dumbshow, with a body language either wincingly simple or so obtuse as to leave the audience stranded. </p> <p>William Tuckett, whose version of Arthur Miller's Crucible is soon to be premiered by the Royal Ballet, acknowledges that dance is \"very bad at dealing with the specifics of narrative\". In his last ballet, Turn of the Screw, he remained faithful to the plot of Henry James's novella and kept \"coming up against brick walls.

It is not a poor imitation of literature but a creative reinterpretation in which dance is free to do what it is best at, namely explore the relationships between characters. Tuckett points to the cliche-ridden depiction of sex scenes in novels and suggests that dance, with its rich ambiguity, can create \"a poeticised image of emotion\" that is much easier for \"everyone to empathise with\". </p> <p>Significantly, he works on these ideas within the format of a single act: he doesn't attempt to spin his story out over a full evening. Yet while the shorter format suits dance and prevents ballets from lapsing into the bland interludes and Polyfiller crowd scenes that are the curse of the overextended three acter, such brevity does not always suit the general public. </p> <p>Companies such as Houston know that the ordinary punter at the ballet does not just want a familiar title to reassure them (the crucial \"name recognition\" that Stevenson admits sells a season); they also like to settle into a solid evening's show, with a juicily absorbing plot and a parade of eye- catching sets and costumes. </p> <p>This is exactly what Stevenson gives them. One of the first qualities that struck me about the $1.2m Cleopatra was the old-fashioned lushness of its staging. Thomas Boyd's sets and Judanna Lynn's costumes have the epic opulence of a Cecil B De Mille movie, with an expensive colour palette of pink, turquoise and gold and a series of show stopping effects - including Cleopatra's entrance, silhouetted against a giant desert sun, in which the barge she is seated in opens out like a phoenix spreading its wings. </p> <p>The music sounds as if it were purpose- written in about 1900 - a fusion of exotic local colour, melodic dance passages and plangent characterisation. In fact it is a cunning arrangement of excerpts from Rimsky-Korsakov's concert and operatic music, and aficionados won't be surprised to learn that it was written by John Lanchbery, the world's master at turning bits and bobs of existing music into coherent ballet scores. His arrangements have facilitated some of the most successful story ballets in the modern rep, including works by Ashton and MacMillan, and it is due in part to his wizardry that Stevenson, while moving at a brisk trot through the climaxes of Cleopatra's life, produces, along the way, so much memorable dance. </p> <p>Stevenson admits that creating full-length story ballets can be frustrating for the choreographer because the steps are the last thing he can consider. \"I feel more like a theatre director,\" he says. His first task will always be to construct the scenario for his composer, his second to work through the staging with his designers, his third to make the dance.

Written out of In Our Time, the official record of the Magnum agency (although she joined in 1947, only a year after its foundation), she likewise fails to appear in any of the histories of women photographers, or in anthologies of 20th-century interviews and biographies, including even Helmut and Alison Gernsheim's Concise History Of Photography. In fact, her body of work is considerable, spanning 50 years across Europe and the Americas.</p> <p>Born in Berlin, Freund was forced to flee to Paris in 1933, when an anti-Hitler plot, in which she was involved, was discovered. She enrolled at the Sorbonne, shifting her studies from the history of art to photography. After the occupation of Paris, she fled south to Lot and joined the resistance.</p> <p>A Jew and an anti-fascist, she used, first, the protection of Adrienne Monnier, who had published her doctorate on 19th-century French photographers; then came the invitation to Argentina from Victoria Ocampo, founder-editor of Sur, probably the most significant literary magazine in Latin America. He had met her in Paris, and published her portraits.</p> <p>Through Monnier's circle, largely gyrating around Sylvia Beach's left bank library-cum-bookshop Shakespeare and Co, Freund had made a powerful reputation with her cybachromes of such literary luminaries as Joyce, Woolf, Malraux (who comforted her with his opinion that \"if one isn't revolutionary in one's youth, one isn't worthy of being an adult\"), Breton, Beckett, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Ionesco and Cocteau.</p> <p>While establishing her reputation as a portraitist in literary circles, Freund also published material in Life magazine, which had been launched in 1936, and, unlike European magazines of the time, used colour. Her reportages and portraits also regularly appeared in Weekly Illustrated and Picture Post in Britain, in Vu and Paris-Match in France, and in Du in Germany. In 1937, she married a Frenchman, Pierre Blum, from whom she was divorced after the war.</p> <p>During her exile Freund became a stills photographer and film producer with the Louis Jouvet theatre company in Argentina and Chile from 1943-44, then worked for the France Libre propaganda services in Buenos Aires from 1944-45. She also continued her freelance career, and, until 1954, covered the whole of Latin America for Magnum.</p> <p>She was prevented from visiting the United States until the 1970s. Her political past - and that of such communist friends as the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and the Mexican painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera - were out of kilter with the mood of McCarthyism and the cold war. She continued her reportages across countries and classes, covering the lives of Bolivian tin miners, British shipyard workers, Japanese fishermen, Canadian trackers, Patagonian Indians - and Paris fashion shows, exhibiting widely in many of the places she photographed.</p> <p>She had returned to live in Paris after the war, and there accrued a considerable collection of prestigious awards.

      "bodyText": "For too long, the work of the photographer Gisele Freund, who has died aged 91, has been hidden from history. Written out of In Our Time, the official record of the Magnum agency (although she joined in 1947, only a year after its foundation), she likewise fails to appear in any of the histories of women photographers, or in anthologies of 20th-century interviews and biographies, including even Helmut and Alison Gernsheim's Concise History Of Photography. In fact, her body of work is considerable, spanning 50 years across Europe and the Americas. Born in Berlin, Freund was forced to flee to Paris in 1933, when an anti-Hitler plot, in which she was involved, was discovered. She enrolled at the Sorbonne, shifting her studies from the history of art to photography. After the occupation of Paris, she fled south to Lot and joined the resistance. A Jew and an anti-fascist, she used, first, the protection of Adrienne Monnier, who had published her doctorate on 19th-century French photographers; then came the invitation to Argentina from Victoria Ocampo, founder-editor of Sur, probably the most significant literary magazine in Latin America. He had met her in Paris, and published her portraits. Through Monnier's circle, largely gyrating around Sylvia Beach's left bank library-cum-bookshop Shakespeare and Co, Freund had made a powerful reputation with her cybachromes of such literary luminaries as Joyce, Woolf, Malraux (who comforted her with his opinion that \"if one isn't revolutionary in one's youth, one isn't worthy of being an adult\"), Breton, Beckett, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Ionesco and Cocteau. While establishing her reputation as a portraitist in literary circles, Freund also published material in Life magazine, which had been launched in 1936, and, unlike European magazines of the time, used colour. Her reportages and portraits also regularly appeared in Weekly Illustrated and Picture Post in Britain, in Vu and Paris-Match in France, and in Du in Germany. In 1937, she married a Frenchman, Pierre Blum, from whom she was divorced after the war. During her exile Freund became a stills photographer and film producer with the Louis Jouvet theatre company in Argentina and Chile from 1943-44, then worked for the France Libre propaganda services in Buenos Aires from 1944-45. She also continued her freelance career, and, until 1954, covered the whole of Latin America for Magnum. She was prevented from visiting the United States until the 1970s. Her political past - and that of such communist friends as the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and the Mexican painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera - were out of kilter with the mood of McCarthyism and the cold war. She continued her reportages across countries and classes, covering the lives of Bolivian tin miners, British shipyard workers, Japanese fishermen, Canadian trackers, Patagonian Indians - and Paris fashion shows, exhibiting widely in many of the places she photographed. She had returned to live in Paris after the war, and there accrued a considerable collection of prestigious awards. She became president of the French Federation of Creative Photographers in 1977, gaining the Grand Prix Na tional des Arts in 1980. President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand appointed her an Officier des Arts et Lettres in 1982 and Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur the following year. Germany, too, recognised her contribution, particularly in her pioneering colour work. In 1963, she contributed to a major show of French portraiture in the 20th century, and in 1977 held her first retrospective in Bonn, winning the German Society's cultural photography prize in 1978. A decade later, the Berlin Werkbund-Archiv honoured her with a retrospective, and in 1989 she was appointed doctor honoris causa at the National Museum of Photography at Bradford University.

The so-called ship of dreams left Genoa for a comeback tour, reinforced by a fleet of aircraft and buses that will criss-cross Italy in an unprecedented electoral campaign. Returning to his roots as cruise ship crooner, the media tycoon unveiled the 202-metre (663ft) vessel as the nerve centre of his Forza Italia party.

An aide confided that, despite the hype, hiring the ship had more to do with logistics than symbolism. \"We don't shout about it, but it will actually save us money by transporting everybody together.\" For the canvassers left on land, no detail has been overlooked. They have been issued with sunglasses, badges, scarves and ties. Mr Berlusconi has ordered them to smile at all times, avoid contentious issues, and compliment voters on their appearance. \"Make sure you have some sweets on you to ward off bad breath, and maintain proper dental hygiene. Keep a handkerchief in your pocket to dry your hands. If you go into a dirty public lavatory, always clean it afterwards, in case people think that it was you who dirtied it.\" Opponents who once mocked Mr Berlusconi's tactics as kitsch have turned queasy as opinion polls show them to be working. His alliance of centre-right parties is leading the government coalition by 58% to 31%, and his own party Forza Italia is likely to consolidate its position as the biggest party. However, new election rules make it impossible to predict the outcome of the 15 regional ballots, in which three quarters of the electorate can vote. \"These elections are extremely important. If Berlusconi wins he'll claim that as a mandate to be made prime minister,\" said James Walston, a political scientist at the American University of Rome. Mr Berlusconi, 63, was ousted as prime minister in 1994 after nine tempestuous months in office. He is appealing against two convictions for false accounting and bribery and faces 10 other charges, but the pendulum is swinging against the magistrates whose \"clean hands\" investigations brought down the political establishment. Voters are disillusioned with the inconclusive trials and suspect that not all the judges are politically impartial. While the government coalition has been alienating voters by its in-fighting, Mr Berlusconi has been refining his image. \"He's a much better politician now. He seems calmer, more capable. Some of those who wouldn't trust him six years ago now may be willing to take the chance,\" said Claudio Lodici, a political scientist. \"He's always been a good communicator. He's got charm, that famous smile, a tone that people like. And he's self-made, so that helps him to look like an outsider.\" Mr Berlusconi, savaged in 1994 for appointing irresponsible ministers, has striven to reassure the electorate by naming respected technocrats as his ministers-in-waiting. He has rebuilt essentially the same alliance that fragmented then, although this time Forza Italia is stronger and expected to wield more control. But Umberto Bossi, leader of the xenophobic Northern League, exacted a price this week for his inclusion in the potential coalition by persuading Mr Berlusconi to back a crackdown on immigration which drew comparisons to J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom Party in Austria. A draft law calls for a two-to-six-months prison term for any would-be immigrants caught trying to enter Italy illegally for the third time, and for Italy to block aid to countries that failed to discourage immigrant smuggling. One Forza Italia party member, Giulio Tremonti, suggested sinking the dinghies smugglers use to ferry would-be immigrants across the Adriatic.",

The decline has proved catastrophic in the cognac region, where one in three producers have given up the struggle, 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) have been taken out of production, and the French government spent about \u00a34m last year alone paying hundreds of growers to tear up their vines and plant Sauvignon grapes.

The Jugendweihe, marking the transition from adolescence to adulthood, enjoyed a state-enforced heyday under communism, when 90% of young east Germans swore an oath to defend socialism and the country's \"unbreakable\" ties with the Sovet Union. Now, 11 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is undergoing an unexpected rebirth in the five federal German states which previously formed the Democratic Republic. The ceremony is virtually unknown in west Germany. This spring more than 93,000 east German 14-year-olds are due to attend Saturday morning Jugendweihe ceremonies. This is 20% more than in 1993, and the organisers predict that the number will continue to rise. \"Parents want their children to mark this important phase of their life with a ceremony,\" said Sabine Deponte, head of the privately funded Jugendweihe organisation in Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt. \"If they are not religious, and many east Germans aren't, then the Jugendweihe is the obvious choice,\" she added. The conservative Christian Democratic party refuses to support the Jugendweihe, because of its previous communist links, but the ceremony's new-found popularity in the east has led politicans from other mainstream parties to speak at its ceremonies. At 11am sharp last Saturday a cross-section of 200 east German 14-year-olds were on parade in Chemnitz city hall, where they were shortly to become officially recognised as adults. Dancers pranced about to a Michael Jackson tune pumped out by the uniformed 1st Chemnitz Youth Brass Band, while a girl compere told the assembled adolescents and their parents: \"The Jugendweihe is a must for freaks.\" Mrs Deponte's 10-minute address to the gathering was peppered with warnings about the dangers inherent in the capitalist \"elbow society\" that had sprung up in eastern Germany since the collapse of communism. \"The new competitive system means that parents and children have far less time for each other than they did in the old days,\" she said.

      "bodyText": "The US justice department has taken unprecedented emergency legal action to protect from \"life-threatening conditions\" the inmates of a juvenile prison in Louisiana run by a corporation which also manages jails and immigration detention centres in Britain. The department is asking a Baton Rouge district court to intervene to stop guards at the prison in Jena abusing the young boys in their custody. The jail is run by the Wackenhut Correction Corporations, which is a partner through its subsidiary Premier Prison Services in four private British prisons, in South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Durham and Scotland. Wackenhut was in the news last year when riots broke out in a prison it ran in New Mexico and its contract to run a prison in Texas was cancelled after a string of incidents in which inmates were abused. But the abuses in Jena may be the worst uncovered so far. A justice department investigation found that guards regularly beat the inmates with batons, hurled teargas grenades into their barrack-like dormitories, and subjected them to long periods in solitary confinement. David Utter, director of the Juvenile Justice project of Louisiana, a civil rights group which represents some of the inmates, said the legal action was \"extraordinary\". \"In fact it is the first time in the history of the statute that it has been done. You can only do it if you think the conditions are life-threatening, and they are really horrendous,\" he said After a series of complaints, the justice department toured the Jena juvenile prison and found that many of the 276 boys held there had no shoes or blankets and were constantly hungry. Many had attempted suicide or deliberately hurt themselves to get into the prison infirmary and beyond the reach of the guards. Wackenhut, founded by George Wackenhut, a billionaire former FBI agent, has grown in recent years to be the world's largest commercial prison operator. It runs 56 institutions in the US, Britain and Australia, and its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The corporation has issued a statement saying that the justice department experts were misled by \"exaggerations and mis-statements of facts\" by the inmates. Their findings, the company said \"do not accurately reflect the condition of the facility today\". A local judge, Mark Doherty, did not agree, and last month he removed six teenage boys from the prison after he found that they had been brutalised by guards, kept in solitary confinment for months, and deprived of shoes, blankets and medical care. One inmate released by his order, a fifteen-year-old from New Orleans, had tried to commit suicide 20 times by swallowing razor blades or hanging himself with a sheet. Mr Doherty, a Republican, said the prisoners \"wound up in a place that drives and treats juveniles as if they walked on all fours\". \"These young people deserve to be treated like human beings, not animals\". Mr Utter said his group had been \"astonished\" by the extent of the abuses at Jena. \"The only thing I can chalk it up to is to arrogance: they had incredible political connections and they clearly thought they could get away from it,\" he said yesterday.",

The prosecutor had to copy the hand motions for the judge because the boy in the witness box was too short to be seen.</p> <p>The boy said he had seen the gun and some coins in a shoebox in Mr James's room - an answer he gave after prosecutor Daniel Stamos reminded him that was what he had told police.</p> <p>The boy said he remembered Kayla being shot.

      "bodyText": "With little more than his eyes and nose visible over the witness stand, a six-year-old boy denied that he shot dead a girl in his first-year class at primary school. He blamed another pupil in year one. The boy testified at a preliminary hearing for a young man who lived in the same house, Jamelle James, 19, who is accused of carelessly storing the semi-automatic handgun that the boy allegedly used to kill Kayla Rolland on February 29. Mr James is charged with involuntary manslaughter; there are no charges against the six-year-old. The boy had to be coaxed into the witness box and barely spoke above a whisper for the 45 minutes he was on the stand. Judge John Conover chatted with the boy and his eight-year-old brother about sports and television to assess whether they were competent to take the stand. Before the boys testified, all cameras and microphones were ordered out, as was a sketch artist. The six-year-old testified that he had seen Mr James playing with the gun and he showed how Mr James twirled it in his hands. The prosecutor had to copy the hand motions for the judge because the boy in the witness box was too short to be seen. The boy said he had seen the gun and some coins in a shoebox in Mr James's room - an answer he gave after prosecutor Daniel Stamos reminded him that was what he had told police. The boy said he remembered Kayla being shot. But when asked if he shot her, he shook his head \"no,\" and blamed another boy to whom he said he had given the gun. \"I wasn't playing with the gun, I wasn't,\" the boy said. The eight-year-old testified that his younger brother had showed him a gun at home before school on the morning Kayla was killed.",

Officials from the SFO have met NHP representatives to examine evidence including transcripts of telephone con versations between one of the group's investment banks, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, and two property executives. The transcripts, seen by the Guardian, show the property directors suggesting that a fraud has been perpetrated on NHP's bondholders. They urge DKB to take up the concerns with the Department of Trade and Industry as well as the SFO and City regulators. The meeting took place on Thursday as the merchant bank Robert Fleming was finalising a list of possible bidders for NHP and the nursing homes group finalised crucial banking facilities. Robert Wardle, assistant director of the SFO, has taken the unusual step of writing to NHP denying that it has received any complaint against the company or that an investigation has been launched. The fraud watchdog has also been handed a dossier which purports to link press coverage, some of which NHP claims was inspired by a campaign of misinformation, with sharp falls in the company's share price. A complaint that a property company was orchestrating a campaign to undermine NHP's share price and make it vulnerable to takeover was recently sent to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors by Rotherham-based Interna tional Project Consultants, a management consultancy. NHP has suffered from financial pressures in the care industry which intensified following changes in government requirements on staffing levels.

      "body": "<p>The heat under the technology sector has been turned up and the meltdown of the business-to-consumer stocks has accelerated. One company finds itself in the hottest part of the fire - America's leading online music retailer, CDNow. If the bears are to be believed, it is merely months from extinction. </p> <p>This week the Nasdaq dropped 9%. In Europe, Germany's Neuer Markt plunged 14% and Britain's Techmark 100 fell 5%, leaving it 25% below the record posted only three weeks ago. </p> <p>Commentators have searched frantically for explanations of this sudden reversal in investment fashions. This scramble for understanding is vital for it may reveal the answer to the question on every investor's lips: is this a blip in a rising trend or the end of the great bull market in tech stocks? Those hoping that these words will lead them directly to the Holy Grail should stop reading now. Only time can provide the answer to a problem whose resolution lies as much in the collective psyche of investors as in the \"fundamentals\" of the new technology industries. </p> <p>That psyche has been subjected to repeated shocks in the past few weeks. Each shock has chipped away at investor perceptions of financial normality. Gradually what was taken for granted as immutable fact - that the valuation of tech shares was readily explicable and sustainable - is now cast into doubt. </p> <p>A recent article in Barrons has contributed greatly to the new mood of insecurity among technology devotees. Its impact has been such that its arguments have been repeated and amplified in the financial press across the globe. I make no apology in joining the band of regurgitators. </p> <p>Barrons commissioned a study of the cash flows of quoted US internet stocks. In an article titled \"Burning Up\", it revealed that on the basis of balance sheets and income and spending pat terns at the end of last year, many were only months from exhausting their financial resources. CDNow was alleged to have only one month's cash left. </p> <p>At the time of publication CDNow shares were 80% below their record high. Alarmed, the company put Barrons straight on a few facts. This week the American financial journal reflected the company's input and corrected its analysis - not one month but seven months from burn-out. CDNow shares responded by halving again. </p> <p>The hunger for cash afflicting the business-to-consumer internet companies should come as no surprise. Their services are new and expensive to construct. The only constant in an ever-shifting landscape is the necessity for vast marketing spend to stake territorial claims. And consumers are reluctant to spend money on what many regard as a free utility. </p> <p>None of this would matter were investors willing to fund the build-up of tomorrow's online consumer giants. However, as traditional consumer companies have fought back with their own web strategies, it has become apparent that many are knocking spots off their upstart rivals. </p> <p>Investor reaction has been to sell consumer internet stocks, in the process choking off one key source of cash for continued business development - equity fundraising. If they are not to simply fizzle out of business, many will need to seek strategic investment from other companies, possibly through full-scale takeovers. </p> <p>With their core brands so strong, it is difficult to envisage bricks-and-mortar businesses paying significant premiums for net brands. However, they may be able to pick up some bargains at fire-sale prices. CDNow is a good brand. In time it may become great. But maybe not to the benefit of its shareholders. </p> <p>This should all be seen as a natural development in an industrial revolution - and not necessarily unhealthy at that. Investment in the new technologies should always have been viewed as (ad)venture capitalism. </p> <p>Impossible though it might seem to some, the shakedown is if anything more exciting than the original trip to the stars that the tech stocks experienced. The greatest opportunities in markets are always presented when panic is in the air and asset prices are adjusted with insufficient discrimination. </p> <p>Four pieces of advice for investors. First, remember that technology will continue to revolutionise the real world. Second, invest in net stocks breaking into profit but whose share prices have been clobbered. Third, back those stocks able to come to market in today's adverse climate. But fourth, don't forget I've no better idea than the next person whether this is just a blip or the end. </p> <p>Edmond Warner is chief executive of Albert E Sharp Securities</p>",

      "bodyText": "The heat under the technology sector has been turned up and the meltdown of the business-to-consumer stocks has accelerated. One company finds itself in the hottest part of the fire - America's leading online music retailer, CDNow. If the bears are to be believed, it is merely months from extinction. This week the Nasdaq dropped 9%. In Europe, Germany's Neuer Markt plunged 14% and Britain's Techmark 100 fell 5%, leaving it 25% below the record posted only three weeks ago. Commentators have searched frantically for explanations of this sudden reversal in investment fashions. This scramble for understanding is vital for it may reveal the answer to the question on every investor's lips: is this a blip in a rising trend or the end of the great bull market in tech stocks? Those hoping that these words will lead them directly to the Holy Grail should stop reading now. Only time can provide the answer to a problem whose resolution lies as much in the collective psyche of investors as in the \"fundamentals\" of the new technology industries. That psyche has been subjected to repeated shocks in the past few weeks. Each shock has chipped away at investor perceptions of financial normality. Gradually what was taken for granted as immutable fact - that the valuation of tech shares was readily explicable and sustainable - is now cast into doubt. A recent article in Barrons has contributed greatly to the new mood of insecurity among technology devotees. Its impact has been such that its arguments have been repeated and amplified in the financial press across the globe. I make no apology in joining the band of regurgitators. Barrons commissioned a study of the cash flows of quoted US internet stocks. In an article titled \"Burning Up\", it revealed that on the basis of balance sheets and income and spending pat terns at the end of last year, many were only months from exhausting their financial resources. CDNow was alleged to have only one month's cash left. At the time of publication CDNow shares were 80% below their record high. Alarmed, the company put Barrons straight on a few facts. This week the American financial journal reflected the company's input and corrected its analysis - not one month but seven months from burn-out. CDNow shares responded by halving again. The hunger for cash afflicting the business-to-consumer internet companies should come as no surprise. Their services are new and expensive to construct. The only constant in an ever-shifting landscape is the necessity for vast marketing spend to stake territorial claims. And consumers are reluctant to spend money on what many regard as a free utility. None of this would matter were investors willing to fund the build-up of tomorrow's online consumer giants. However, as traditional consumer companies have fought back with their own web strategies, it has become apparent that many are knocking spots off their upstart rivals. Investor reaction has been to sell consumer internet stocks, in the process choking off one key source of cash for continued business development - equity fundraising. If they are not to simply fizzle out of business, many will need to seek strategic investment from other companies, possibly through full-scale takeovers. With their core brands so strong, it is difficult to envisage bricks-and-mortar businesses paying significant premiums for net brands. However, they may be able to pick up some bargains at fire-sale prices. CDNow is a good brand. In time it may become great. But maybe not to the benefit of its shareholders. This should all be seen as a natural development in an industrial revolution - and not necessarily unhealthy at that. Investment in the new technologies should always have been viewed as (ad)venture capitalism. Impossible though it might seem to some, the shakedown is if anything more exciting than the original trip to the stars that the tech stocks experienced. The greatest opportunities in markets are always presented when panic is in the air and asset prices are adjusted with insufficient discrimination. Four pieces of advice for investors. First, remember that technology will continue to revolutionise the real world. Second, invest in net stocks breaking into profit but whose share prices have been clobbered. Third, back those stocks able to come to market in today's adverse climate. But fourth, don't forget I've no better idea than the next person whether this is just a blip or the end.
