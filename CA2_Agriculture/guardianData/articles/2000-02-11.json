The search for a replacement for the sacked John Barnes will begin immediately and his successor should be in place by the end of the season. </p> <p>After a day when the fans waited patiently for the announcement confirming what half of Glasgow already knew, Dalglish and the club's chief executive Allan MacDonald emerged at teatime to say that the head coach and his assistant Eric Black had had their contracts terminated. Terry McDermott, nicknamed \"the social manager\", left by mutual consent. </p> <p>MacDonald looked grim and Dalglish downcast after some of the worst days in the club's history. Celtic lost, after leading by two goals, in the league last Saturday and their humiliating 3-1 home defeat by Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the Scottish Cup on Tuesday sealed the fate of the novitiate English coach. </p> <p>\"This does not bring me any pleasure at all,\" said Dalglish. \"The three lads who have gone were all great fellows. John Barnes will go on to be a successful manager because he has all the qualities for the job but it will not be at Celtic. Eric Black did a great job with the young players. Unfortunately John gave Terry that nickname but anyone who thinks he was merely my runner bringing me back stories from the dressing room is simply telling lies. </p> <p>\"I feel the responsibility as well. If the board had asked me to go, I would have done so. Maybe I should have spent more time as director of football with the first team but there were other areas I was concentrating on. I am taking over until such time as we find a replacement and it will be done as soon as it possibly can be.\" So Celtic are looking for their fifth manager in four years. </p> <p>Dalglish will hold a press conference today and his team for Saturday's match at Dundee will give some clues to the state of mind in the dressing room - a major reason why Barnes's stay at the club ended after only seven months. Dalglish clearly thinks the players let down a friend with whom he played at Liverpool and whom he signed for Newcastle. </p> <p>\"John was manager of the month in December,\" said Dalglish. \"Players can gain you results but can also get you the sack. The players should look at themselves and realise that Celtic demands passion and commitment. If they don't want to wear the jersey then they should not come to work. If there are any people like that, they won't be here long. There will be problems for those who won't give 100% for the club.\" </p> <p>The fans will certainly give Dalglish a chance but there remains the impression that Celtic are again in a process of transition. The director of football, who is on a seven-year contract, has made it clear that, although he is prepared to step into the brreach, he has no intention of reviving a full-time managerial career. </p> <p>He stressed that Barnes's successor should know about the traditions of the club and the favourites are led by Tommy Burns, a former Celtic manager who is the choice of the supporters despite his subsequent failure in England with Reading, and Joe Kinnear, the former Wimbledon manager who recently indicated that he is ready to return to football following a heart attack last year. </p> <p>It is unlikely Dalglish would be attracted to Wim Jansen, the Dutchman who won the title in 1998 but left after his only season at Parkhead and is now scouting for Feyenoord. </p> <p>\u0095 Rangers have ended negotiations for Sergei Rebrov, Dynamo Kiev's \u00a312m striker. The Ibrox chairman David Murray said: \"We have pulled out because of something which came to our attention at a very late stage.\" He did not specify the problem but insisted that Rebrov was close to joining - \" a deal was in place between myself and Kiev president Grigory Surkis. The player had also agreed to come to us and we expected to have him by next Tuesday.\" </p> <p><strong>Related strories</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,135559,00.html\">No hiding place for Dalglish</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,135558,00.html\">The Kenny Dalglish story</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,135561,00.html\">Off-the-pitch fortunes reflect tumultuous six months</a></p>",

Dalglish clearly thinks the players let down a friend with whom he played at Liverpool and whom he signed for Newcastle. \"John was manager of the month in December,\" said Dalglish. \"Players can gain you results but can also get you the sack. The players should look at themselves and realise that Celtic demands passion and commitment. If they don't want to wear the jersey then they should not come to work. If there are any people like that, they won't be here long. There will be problems for those who won't give 100% for the club.\" The fans will certainly give Dalglish a chance but there remains the impression that Celtic are again in a process of transition. The director of football, who is on a seven-year contract, has made it clear that, although he is prepared to step into the brreach, he has no intention of reviving a full-time managerial career. He stressed that Barnes's successor should know about the traditions of the club and the favourites are led by Tommy Burns, a former Celtic manager who is the choice of the supporters despite his subsequent failure in England with Reading, and Joe Kinnear, the former Wimbledon manager who recently indicated that he is ready to return to football following a heart attack last year. It is unlikely Dalglish would be attracted to Wim Jansen, the Dutchman who won the title in 1998 but left after his only season at Parkhead and is now scouting for Feyenoord. \u0095 Rangers have ended negotiations for Sergei Rebrov, Dynamo Kiev's \u00a312m striker. The Ibrox chairman David Murray said: \"We have pulled out because of something which came to our attention at a very late stage.\" He did not specify the problem but insisted that Rebrov was close to joining - \" a deal was in place between myself and Kiev president Grigory Surkis. The player had also agreed to come to us and we expected to have him by next Tuesday.\" Related strories No hiding place for Dalglish The Kenny Dalglish story Off-the-pitch fortunes reflect tumultuous six months",

Both Molde and Wimbledon are owned by the Norwegian businessman Kjell Inge Rokke, and Olsen had been told that there was no money available for transfers. \"I was a bit surprised that we had enough money,\" he said, \"but it's probably because it's another club under the same umbrella.\" Lund, 24, has scored four times in eight appearances for Norway and brings to five the Norwegians in Olsen's squad. Derby's Danish striker Mikkel Beck has joined Queens Park Rangers on loan for a month after turning down a move to Crystal Palace. Barnet have been handed a reprieve to continue playing at Underhill while they develop a new ground with the proviso that it has a minimum capacity of 5,500 by August. Peter Middleton is to retire as chairman of the Football League at the end of the season. Scotland and the Republic of Ireland are to meet in a friendly in Dublin on May 30. Meanwhile Mick McCarthy has named his squad to face the Czech Republic at Lansdowne Road on Wednesday week. Republic of Ireland: A Kelly (Blackburn), Given (Newcastle Utd), Kiely (Charlton), G Kelly (Leeds), Carr (Tottenham), Staunton (Liverpool), Cunningham (Wimbledon), Harte (Leeds), Breen (Coventry), Babb (Liverpool), Butler (Sunderland), Kennedy (Man City), Roy Keane (Man Utd), Kinsella (Charlton), Delap (Derby), McPhail (Leeds), McAteer (Blackburn), Kilbane (Sunderland), Duff (Blackburn), Quinn (Sunderland), Robbie Keane (Coventry), Connolly (Excelsior).",

And we\u0092ll wager that most \u0091victims\u0092 of the Stansted hijack are still enjoying life on benefits in Britain, five years hence\u0085Police have booked 83 suites at the four-star Hilton National Hotel where rooms cost \u00a3202 a night. One guest at the hotel said: \u0091This hotel cost an arm and a leg to stay at although it is very nice. The hostages must think they are in heaven after coming from Afghanistan. I dread to think how much it is costing.\u0092 (Leader comment and news report, February 11) The Mirror \u0091Hijack gang should be sent packing\u0092: It is right that Britain should play its part in helping people who face murder, torture and rape in their own lands. But it would be offensive if people who want a better life could hijack a plane, be put up in expensive hotels and then be allowed to settle here. The hijackers and their accomplices must be sent back. (Leader comment, February 11) The Star \u0091Welcome to your home cheat home\u0092: The flood of asylum bids \u0096 likely to total around 100 \u0096 confirmed growing suspicions that the hijack had been a well-planned scam by Afghanis who want to settle in the West to escape the poor conditions in their strict Muslim homeland\u0085Jack Straw promises to be tough with the criminals and scam merchants from the hijacked 727. So far this entails putting the whole lot in a four-star hotel while Mr Straw decides what to do with them. They\u0092re enjoying satellite movies, and getting all the food and clothes they need from \u0091soft touch\u0092 Britain. No wonder one passing policeman said they were all smiles. Why on earth aren\u0092t they awaiting their fate behind bars? (News report and leader comment, February 11) The Sun \u0091Mug\u0092s game\u0092: Amazing, isn\u0092t it. No wonder the reaction in Afghanistan to the hijack was one of envy. It is a passport to a new life of decent housing and social security. Maybe [the hijackers] read about the gang who hijacked a Sudanese plane three years ago. They are still here in Britain, doing very nicely at your expense. (Leader comment in The Sun, February 10) The Express \u0091Hijack passengers should not expect asylum here\u0092: There should be no sympathy for the hostage-takers. The arsenal of weapons found on board shows that they were prepared to kill to achieve their aims. [Jack] Straw will now have to follow up yesterday\u0092s tough talk with fast action. Only then will he discourage others from seeing Britain as an easy target. (Leader comment, The Express, February 11)",

      "bodyText": "The Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has suspended the Stormont assembly, despite a last-minute announcement from Sinn Fein of a new proposal for decommissioning. On a day of political interventions, from Gerry Adams to President Clinton, nothing proved enough to avert the suspension of Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration that has wielded authority for just 72 days. Announcing the reimposition of direct rule, Mr Mandelson said: \"We have got to clear up this issue of decommissioning once and for all.\" Earlier, Mr Mandelson had confirmed talks were continuing to win a clear-cut disarmament commitment from the IRA, but said he didn't want \"to raise people's expectations\" because he had \"no news of any last-minute breakthrough.\" Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said: \"It is not an event in which we take any pleasure at all.\" But he said it was now time for the IRA to \"reciprocate\" the moves to peace that unionists had made. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said late in the day that a new proposal set out the context in which the IRA would deal with decommissioning. \"When set alongside the IRA's recent assertion that the peace process is under no threat from it and its guns are silent, this new development takes on an enormous significance and can, if there is political will and goodwill, finally resolve this matter.\" The Sinn Fein president said he anticipated the report by the international decommissioning body would reflect the latest developments and \"clear the way to end this crisis\". However, Mr Trimble said he had spoken to both Mr Adams and Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness. \"They had nothing to put before me,\" he said. In Washington, US president Bill Clinton said that if the cabinet does lose its powers, \"it is imperative that all the parties do it on terms which do not allow a backslide.\" Mr Clinton has been involved in a week of telephone diplomacy involving the British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. Northern Ireland deputy first minister Seamus Mallon made a last-ditch effort to ward off the suspension of the political institutions, meeting Mr Mandelson to warn him yet again of the dangers of suspension. Speaking afterwards outside Castle Buildings, Mr Mallon said he believed suspension would \"make obtaining decommissioning immeasurably more difficult\". Suspension would make it \"very, very difficult timewise, politically, logistically and every other way to have the institutions reinstated\", he said. Sinn Fein also appealed to Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson to step back from suspending political institutions in the province over the row about IRA decommissioning. Stormont education minister Martin McGuinness urged the Northern Ireland secretary to reconsider his decision and stressed that republicans are still working hard to try and achieve a resolution of the arms issue. \"Even at this late hour, Sinn Fein is continuing to do its best,\" he claimed. \"We all know that there is a need to remove all ultimatums and deadlines, threats of suspension and resignations from this process. \"Even at this late hour he should reflect and he should pull back from the disastrous course on which he appears to be set,\" Mr McGuinness added. Meanwhile, two dozen Sinn Fein protestors gathered outside the central Belfast headquarters of the Ulster Unionist party. The demonstrators held up placards declaring \"Peter Mandelson betrays 2.5 million voters\", \"unionists ran away. Sinn Fein here to stay\" and \"Tony Blair no suspension\".",

      "bodyText": "The Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has suspended the Stormont assembly, despite a last-minute announcement from Sinn Fein of a new proposal for decommissioning. On a day of political interventions, from Gerry Adams to President Clinton, nothing proved enough to avert the suspension of Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration that has wielded authority for just 72 days. Announcing the reimposition of direct rule, Mr Mandelson said: \"We have got to clear up this issue of decommissioning once and for all.\" Earlier, Mr Mandelson had confirmed talks were continuing to win a clear-cut disarmament commitment from the IRA, but said he didn't want \"to raise people's expectations\" because he had \"no news of any last-minute breakthrough.\" Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said: \"It is not an event in which we take any pleasure at all.\" But he said it was now time for the IRA to \"reciprocate\" the moves to peace that unionists had made. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said late in the day that a new proposal set out the context in which the IRA would deal with decommissioning. \"When set alongside the IRA's recent assertion that the peace process is under no threat from it and its guns are silent, this new development takes on an enormous significance and can, if there is political will and goodwill, finally resolve this matter.\" The Sinn Fein president said he anticipated the report by the international decommissioning body would reflect the latest developments and \"clear the way to end this crisis\". However, Mr Trimble said he had spoken to both Mr Adams and Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness. \"They had nothing to put before me,\" he said. In Washington, US president Bill Clinton said that if the cabinet does lose its powers, \"it is imperative that all the parties do it on terms which do not allow a backslide.\" Mr Clinton has been involved in a week of telephone diplomacy involving the British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. Northern Ireland deputy first minister Seamus Mallon made a last-ditch effort to ward off the suspension of the political institutions, meeting Mr Mandelson to warn him yet again of the dangers of suspension. Speaking afterwards outside Castle Buildings, Mr Mallon said he believed suspension would \"make obtaining decommissioning immeasurably more difficult\". Suspension would make it \"very, very difficult timewise, politically, logistically and every other way to have the institutions reinstated\", he said. Sinn Fein also appealed to Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson to step back from suspending political institutions in the province over the row about IRA decommissioning.

      "body": "<p>The most common image of Ralph Vaughan Williams is that of the comfortable English pastoralist, and the Fifth Symphony, the most widely performed of his nine, seems on first acquaintance to conform totally to that image. But there's more to the genesis of the work than that. It is bracketed in Vaughan Williams's symphonic development by two very different works , the violent and extreme Fourth Symphony of 1935, which seems to foreshadow the world-wide conflagration to come, and the Sixth (1947), which inhabits a world totally numbed by the horror of what that war has produced. </p> <p>Yet the Fifth appeared at the height of the second world war in 1943 how at such a moment did Vaughan Williams produce a work of such serene contemplation? In fact the origins of the work date back well before even the composition of the Fourth Symphony. For much of the 30s he had worked on an opera based upon Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, before setting the project aside (he eventually completed it in 1951), and deciding to recycle some of what he had written in symphonic form. </p> <p>There is a dark undertow to the symphony, which wells up most clearly in the scherzo's brusque brass punctuations and in the troubled central section of the slow movement. The landscapes that the Fifth explores are by no means as benign as they at first appear, and the finest interpreters of the work do not mistake the surface calm for the key to the whole work. Some versions do just that , Leonard Slatkin's, for instance, is bland to the point of harmlessness (RCA) even Adrian Boult's (EMI) is more superficial than it needs to be, and Vernon Handley (EMI) takes his cue from the same approach. </p> <p>Something sharper is suggested by Andre Previn (RCA) and Andrew Davis (Teldec), but the one who draws all the elements of the Fifth Symphony most purposefully is a Dutchman. Bernard Haitink's carefully measured version with the London Philharmonic has a monumental integrity and real troubling depth, to which his wonderfully paced unfolding of the passacaglia provides the perfect finish. </p> <p><strong>Key Recording: Haitink (EMI 5 55487 2)</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The most common image of Ralph Vaughan Williams is that of the comfortable English pastoralist, and the Fifth Symphony, the most widely performed of his nine, seems on first acquaintance to conform totally to that image. But there's more to the genesis of the work than that. It is bracketed in Vaughan Williams's symphonic development by two very different works , the violent and extreme Fourth Symphony of 1935, which seems to foreshadow the world-wide conflagration to come, and the Sixth (1947), which inhabits a world totally numbed by the horror of what that war has produced. Yet the Fifth appeared at the height of the second world war in 1943 how at such a moment did Vaughan Williams produce a work of such serene contemplation? In fact the origins of the work date back well before even the composition of the Fourth Symphony. For much of the 30s he had worked on an opera based upon Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, before setting the project aside (he eventually completed it in 1951), and deciding to recycle some of what he had written in symphonic form. There is a dark undertow to the symphony, which wells up most clearly in the scherzo's brusque brass punctuations and in the troubled central section of the slow movement. The landscapes that the Fifth explores are by no means as benign as they at first appear, and the finest interpreters of the work do not mistake the surface calm for the key to the whole work. Some versions do just that , Leonard Slatkin's, for instance, is bland to the point of harmlessness (RCA) even Adrian Boult's (EMI) is more superficial than it needs to be, and Vernon Handley (EMI) takes his cue from the same approach. Something sharper is suggested by Andre Previn (RCA) and Andrew Davis (Teldec), but the one who draws all the elements of the Fifth Symphony most purposefully is a Dutchman. Bernard Haitink's carefully measured version with the London Philharmonic has a monumental integrity and real troubling depth, to which his wonderfully paced unfolding of the passacaglia provides the perfect finish. Key Recording: Haitink (EMI 5 55487 2)",

So convinced did I become of my very perfection that I left without feeling the need to buy anything at all. </p> <p>Funny, but I've felt the same sentiment during most of the shows. Not much has rocked my casbah. Taking their lead from Milan, no doubt, many New York designers seem to have abandoned the casual sportswear and relaxed dressing they do best in favour of a classic, tailored, ladylike approach peppered with buzzwords such as \"elegance\" and \"femininity\". DKNY, whose last three seasons have been superb, was less so this time, with Karan departing from loose, slouchy daywear to cater instead for an uptown girl with a penchant for waxy leather trenchcoats, black pencil skirts and chiffon blouses. There were many good pieces here - a calf-length pleated chiffon skirt with a low leather waistband, and a simple turtleneck jumper - but the show hardly pushed the simple throw-it-all-on-together-without-thinking philosophy for which Karan is most loved. </p> <p>New York Fashion Week is alone in showing mens and womenswear concurrently: the menswear shows are at the beginning of the week, there are some mixed shows in the middle and the last few days are devoted to womenswear. Front row at Sean \"It Wasn't Me\" Combs's first menswear show was a selection of rap royalty including Missy Elliot and Lil' Kim - both dripping with fur, as was the catwalk. As you'd expect, Combs's Sean John label is for men who aren't afraid of being mugged on a badly lit sidewalk. They probably travel everywhere by limo. Full-length mink coats, baggy-cut cashmere suits and diamonds were the order of the day. </p> <p>Fur: will you or won't you? Nearly every designer in New York incorporated it into their collections, and you can bet your veggieburger that Milan and Paris will follow suit. Carolina Herrera went the whole hog (or the whole mink; in fact, several mink must have lost their lives in making her stripy blouson jackets) with a full-length coat described as \"Russian golden sable\". </p> <p>Though Oscar de la Renta's show was stormed by anti-fur protesters, he was hardly the worst offender. Mink trims, knitted fox and fluid shearling were as ubiquitous as off-duty yellow cabs. It is utterly bizarre, as a British person, to find yourself waiting for a show to begin while surrounded by fur-clad fasherati. They wear it without apology, heads held high, in every permutation known to man, or at least to David Attenborough. I had trouble identifying some of the more outlandish types myself. </p> <p>Outlandish, certainly by standards, was the collection by Miguel Androvar, who recycles old fabrics and fashions them into something new and quite wonderful. Logo mania? Try his mac, made from old Burberry fabric and with the label bang in the centre of the chest. Raw edges and unfinished seams featured on a coat of mattress ticking (the mattress apparently once belonged to Quentin Crisp) yet the overall effect was super-sexy. Definitely one to watch. </p> <p>Hugo Boss's menswear (beige bonded cotton coats, button-up anoraks, chunky polonecks and slimmish trousers) will sell in spades, but the womenswear was hit and miss. Strongest were loose, square-neck muslin dresses with embroidered yokes, in beige, navy or muslin, but Hugo loses points for making even Gisele's body look lumpy in a black velvet evening dress that bunched up round her tummy. </p> <p>The wilds of Scotland are possibly the last place you'd expect to find the rock fan, sweatshirt king and all-American geezer Tommy Hilfiger. Last season, it was glam rock chic and a live performance by Bush; this season, it was a tumble in the heather in a twinset. \"I visited Scotland with my family to explore the history of my ancestors and was overwhelmed by the striking beauty of the land,\" said Hilfiger, playing up to fashion's current obsession with heritage in a highly bogus way. </p> <p>Ponyskin, crocodile skin and cashmere were mixed in with lots of tartan: black leather jackets with tartan lining for men and tartan kneelength skirts or chiffon evening dresses for women. All a departure for Hilfiger, but a far from original one. The man who made his money dressing hip-hop kids in clean-cut casual clothes is guilty of trying to cover all bases: combining \"Scottish heritage\" with an \"all-American sensibility\" was never a logical idea. </p> <p>Ralph Lauren's show was Scottish in places, but more subtle and assured. You've got to hand it to Ralph: if you had all the money in the world, it would be pretty dandy to \"dress down\" for the weekend in his super-luxurious burnished gold leather jeans, Fair Isle cashmere turtleneck and moss-green Donegal tweed jacket. For evening, black velvet was in abundance: sweeping floorlength skirts worn with sequinned shell tops in a red-and-burgandy tapestry effect. Lauren called it Modern Opulence, and indeed it was. </p> <p>Marc Jacobs took us back to the 60s for his show, which made use of heavy fabrics such as leather, tweed, corduroy and denim. His vision for men was a corduroy car coat with big buttons and a leather trim, chunky polo and tapered denim trousers. For women, it was a herringbone trapeze-line pinafore dress worn with a cashmere jumper underneath, bare legs and low-heeled shoes. Although these were boys and girls, rather than men and women, it's hard to feel anything but girlish in a pinafore dress. This was a very demure collection, full of condiment colours - mustard, brown sauce and ketchup. Eveningwear was a modern reworking of the prom dress: tight bodices, bell-shaped skirts which fell to mid-calf and layers and layers of tulle, cut to look like flower petals, frothing over shoulders. </p> <p>Anna Sui also stayed with the 60s/early 70s, presenting a bunch of girls dressed to smoke pot all day and sway along to the Rolling Stones. Eveningwear was weak: lurex skirts with silky fringes and mohair embroidered tulle tops looked clumsy, but elsewhere her rich hippy aesthetic triumphed. Long brown suede shearling coats, patchwork jeans and fringed tops were worn with floppy wide-brimmed hats and block-heeled boots. Colours were bright - burned orange, plum and violet. </p> <p>Head and sexy leather shoulders above everything else this week towered Bottega Veneta - not as catchy a name as Gucci or Fendi, granted, but if there's any justice in the world, this label deserves to be just as huge. This was a superb collection: a super-sensual marriage of tweed, leather and wit in hot pink, toffee brown or car-seat grey. Strapless tweed dresses with wide leather belts, loose nappa trenchcoats and high calf-length boots oozed sexiness, while the leather wear - slashed, woven and patchworked - was unparalleled. It was 80s, but modern rather than retro. It made me drool. It rocked my casbah, my boat and my world. And if I were rich enough, it would rock my wardrobe, too. </p> <p>\u0095 Still to come at the New York shows: Helmut Lang, Donna Karan, Daryl K, John Bartlett, Calvin Klein and Tse.</p>",

Try his mac, made from old Burberry fabric and with the label bang in the centre of the chest. Raw edges and unfinished seams featured on a coat of mattress ticking (the mattress apparently once belonged to Quentin Crisp) yet the overall effect was super-sexy. Definitely one to watch. Hugo Boss's menswear (beige bonded cotton coats, button-up anoraks, chunky polonecks and slimmish trousers) will sell in spades, but the womenswear was hit and miss. Strongest were loose, square-neck muslin dresses with embroidered yokes, in beige, navy or muslin, but Hugo loses points for making even Gisele's body look lumpy in a black velvet evening dress that bunched up round her tummy. The wilds of Scotland are possibly the last place you'd expect to find the rock fan, sweatshirt king and all-American geezer Tommy Hilfiger. Last season, it was glam rock chic and a live performance by Bush; this season, it was a tumble in the heather in a twinset. \"I visited Scotland with my family to explore the history of my ancestors and was overwhelmed by the striking beauty of the land,\" said Hilfiger, playing up to fashion's current obsession with heritage in a highly bogus way. Ponyskin, crocodile skin and cashmere were mixed in with lots of tartan: black leather jackets with tartan lining for men and tartan kneelength skirts or chiffon evening dresses for women. All a departure for Hilfiger, but a far from original one. The man who made his money dressing hip-hop kids in clean-cut casual clothes is guilty of trying to cover all bases: combining \"Scottish heritage\" with an \"all-American sensibility\" was never a logical idea. Ralph Lauren's show was Scottish in places, but more subtle and assured. You've got to hand it to Ralph: if you had all the money in the world, it would be pretty dandy to \"dress down\" for the weekend in his super-luxurious burnished gold leather jeans, Fair Isle cashmere turtleneck and moss-green Donegal tweed jacket. For evening, black velvet was in abundance: sweeping floorlength skirts worn with sequinned shell tops in a red-and-burgandy tapestry effect. Lauren called it Modern Opulence, and indeed it was. Marc Jacobs took us back to the 60s for his show, which made use of heavy fabrics such as leather, tweed, corduroy and denim. His vision for men was a corduroy car coat with big buttons and a leather trim, chunky polo and tapered denim trousers. For women, it was a herringbone trapeze-line pinafore dress worn with a cashmere jumper underneath, bare legs and low-heeled shoes. Although these were boys and girls, rather than men and women, it's hard to feel anything but girlish in a pinafore dress. This was a very demure collection, full of condiment colours - mustard, brown sauce and ketchup. Eveningwear was a modern reworking of the prom dress: tight bodices, bell-shaped skirts which fell to mid-calf and layers and layers of tulle, cut to look like flower petals, frothing over shoulders. Anna Sui also stayed with the 60s/early 70s, presenting a bunch of girls dressed to smoke pot all day and sway along to the Rolling Stones. Eveningwear was weak: lurex skirts with silky fringes and mohair embroidered tulle tops looked clumsy, but elsewhere her rich hippy aesthetic triumphed. Long brown suede shearling coats, patchwork jeans and fringed tops were worn with floppy wide-brimmed hats and block-heeled boots. Colours were bright - burned orange, plum and violet. Head and sexy leather shoulders above everything else this week towered Bottega Veneta - not as catchy a name as Gucci or Fendi, granted, but if there's any justice in the world, this label deserves to be just as huge. This was a superb collection: a super-sensual marriage of tweed, leather and wit in hot pink, toffee brown or car-seat grey. Strapless tweed dresses with wide leather belts, loose nappa trenchcoats and high calf-length boots oozed sexiness, while the leather wear - slashed, woven and patchworked - was unparalleled. It was 80s, but modern rather than retro. It made me drool. It rocked my casbah, my boat and my world. And if I were rich enough, it would rock my wardrobe, too. \u0095 Still to come at the New York shows: Helmut Lang, Donna Karan, Daryl K, John Bartlett, Calvin Klein and Tse.",

      "body": "<p>Talk to any woman about clothes, and one subject is almost sure to come up: finding the perfect trousers. While the pomp and pageantry of catwalk fashion hold the gaze of the media, the wardrobe fantasies of real women are more likely to centre around that elusive pair of black trousers. This is what the real business of getting dressed is all about: trousers that fit like a dream, go with everything and can be worn anywhere. Oh, and make your legs look longer and your backside smaller. </p> <p>Reader, I've found them. Not that I can take the credit, sadly: Gwyneth Paltrow let the world in on the secret when she told American Vogue, \"I try to get every pair of pants Katayone Adeli makes.\" Even before that, Garbage singer Shirley Manson told American Harpers Bazaar that Katayone Adeli \"knows how to dress women's arses - more people should learn how she cuts.\" </p> <p>If you're thinking \"Katayone who ?\" you're not alone. The Iranian-born, California-raised designer is still little known in this country; Harvey Nichols is her only British stockist although this is likely to change soon as industry insiders predict 2000 to be a breakthrough year for her label. Katayone Adeli (pronounced kat-eye-own a- del -ee) made her name as designer for the Los Angeles line, Parallel, before moving to New York and launching her own label. </p> <p> Last year the two-and-a-half year-old label did $20m in sales and won Adeli a new designer nomination for the Perry Ellis award, given by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. </p> <p>Adeli does not, of course, just design trousers. Her designs runs the gamut of womenswear from jeans to evening dresses, with shoes - in association with Jimmy Choo - to be added from next season. But her trousers are legendary. Yasmin Yusuf, managing director of the British high street group Warehouse and a confirmed Adeli addict, credits the designer as \"hugely influential in the whole trend for low, tight trousers\" - the boy-cut, straight-leg hipsters that in the past five years have replaced traditional high-waisted, tapered trousers in many women's wardrobes. </p> <p>In the hip store Scoop in downtown New York, I try a controlled experiment to see what all the fuss is about. They only have one pair of Katayone Adeli \"pants\" left in my size - and they're turquoise, not generally a sensible colour, bottom-wise. I try them on anyway and they look good. Really good. At first I can't figure out why. Perhaps turquoise is my colour after all. </p> <p>But no, that's not it. First, there's the low waistband, a simple ploy to make your behind look more petite, as there appears to be less of it. Secondly, the back pockets are placed a little wider than usual - later, at Adeli's own store, it is explained to me that this makes your bottom look narrower. </p> <p>The legs are cut straight, but taper very slightly around the knee - the thinnest part of the leg - to give a lengthy, svelte look. The fabric is stretchy enough not to look bulky, but sturdy enough to keep a clean line. Had there been any colour other than turquoise, I wouldn't have been able to part with my $128 fast enough. </p> <p>It is her skill at flattering the female form that inspires devotion among Adeli-wearers. Adeli herself is an attractive, limelight-shy 33-year-old who prefers to let her press officer, Antony Halabi, do most of the talking. She refuses to be photographed, sending out copies of her publicity picture instead. She has a no-nonsense attitude to fashion, disdaining catwalk shows as \"high drama for no drama at all\". </p> <p>Suspicious of the media and its constant need for an \"angle\", she appreciates perfectly that most women are far more interested in clothes that flatter than in wearing this season's perfect shade of purple or the latest hi-tech fabrics. The root of Adeli's body-consciousness lies in her West Coast background. As Adeli puts it, \"you wear less clothing in LA\", so the emphasis on body shape is greater. Almost imperceptible details are used to make the wearer look leaner, more shapely: a few extra gathers on the top of the shoulder of a jacket where the sleeve starts, combined with a precisely cut underarm and torso, give the impression of broader shoulders and a narrower body. Even the colour palette is chosen to be as flattering to the skin as possible. Knitwear, for instance, is woven from a subtle melange of colours, as a slight mixture makes the complexion, by contrast, look more even. </p> <p>Although New York has taken Adeli to its heart, the West Coast connection continues, Adeli providing clothes for the forthcoming remake of the Charlie's Angels television series. </p> <p>\"They wanted a look that was timeless, but modern.\" says Halabi. Timelessness is a recurring theme in Adeli's work. She avoids \"deliberate trends\", preferring an evolutionary and practical approach to her seasonal collections. </p> <p>Her designs are clean and easy to wear, but with subtle recurring motifs which add flavour - blanket-stitching on a carpaccio-thin leather jacket, pin-pleats at a trouser waistband. The legendary American fashion editor Polly Mellen describes her as being \"about pieces, sportswear and a little touch of femininity\". </p> <p> Disregarding the yo-yo of bi-annual trends is radical enough for a fashion designer, but shunning the celebrity circuit is quite another. Although Adeli is \"flattered\" that Gwyneth Paltrow likes her designs, giving clothes away to celebrities is \"a practice she doesn't believe in. If you like the clothes, you buy them.\" Adeli believes women should buy clothes that suit them rather than ape celebrities. </p> <p>The new Katayone Adeli flagship store in New York reflects her dislike of publicity. Bond Street in the East Village is a world apart from its London namesake: edgy and painfully hip, with a builders' merchant next door to a photographic supply centre, a hardware store beside a cult perfumery. </p> <p>The Adeli shop is spacious and white in art-gallery style, with a white plaster wall to prevent clothes being seen from the street. \"We wanted it to be private,\" says Halabi. \"Our customer knows we are here.\" </p> <p>Word of mouth has already netted Katayone Adeli a robustly healthy customer base. It doesn't take a marketing expert to know that being able to cut clothes that make women look thinner is, to put it bluntly, a licence to print money. Expansion is on the cards; she thinks \"it would be fun\" to design menswear. </p> <p>OK, Katayone. But please, keep making those trousers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs last night voted overwhelmingly for the gay age of consent to be lowered to 16, paving the way for an historic change in the law by Easter this year. In the third Commons free vote on the issue in this parliament, 263 MPs approved the change against 102, a majority of 161. Supporters included most Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs and a handful of Conservatives, including the new shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, who last year revealed he had had homosexual experiences as a young man. The reform ends the situation in which heterosexuals and lesbians can consent to sex at 16 but gay men must be 18. It was about creating a society \"free from prejudice\", the home secretary, Jack Straw, said last night. Peter Tatchell of the gay campaign group OutRage! hailed the vote as the \"last lap\" in a 30-year fight for equality. The vote on the second reading of the sexual offences (amendment) bill, which followed a passionate debate in which MPs were split mainly along party lines, was similar to Commons verdicts after two earlier government attempts to change the law. In both those cases the measure was thrown out by the House of Lords. Though the upper house - even with the absence of hereditary peers - may refuse again to accept the reform, the government can now invoke the parliament acts to force the measure through with no need for another debate in the Commons. The bill introduces a new offence of abuse of trust: a person aged over 18 in a position of authority, such as a teacher, can be prosecuted for having sex with a youngster in their care. The legislation also decriminalises a younger person in male homosexual acts or buggery if one party is under and the other over the age of consent. Introducing the debate, Mr Straw said: \"For me, the issue raised in this bill is one of equality, of seeking to create a society which is free from prejudice, of one where our relationships with others, including with strangers, are based upon respect and not upon fear.\" The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, called the bill a \"dangerous move,\" sending the wrong signals to teachers, parents and young people. \"I don't believe the issue of equality should override the imperative to protect young people,\" she said. Ann Keen (Labour, Brentford and Isleworth), whose 1998 attempt to equalise the age of consent was defeated in the Lords, said the Tory attitude seemed to be \"intolerance, prejudice and discrimination\". It was offensive to suggest that those who voted for the age of consent to be equalised were not concerned with abuse of children. \"The key word is consent and that has always been the case as far as I am concerned.\" The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said his party had campaigned for a lower age of consent since it was formed in 1988. \"You cannot say to gay people that you value them as equals if the law does not treat them as equals. \"If in 2000 we cannot move forward, my friends, we are in big trouble indeed.\" The Tory rightwinger John Bercow, education and employment spokesman, previously opposed to lowering the age, this time backed the move, arguing that the status quo did not benefit anybody but was a \"recipe for confusion, for misery and for fear\".",

      "bodyText": "Britain's lower house of parliament approved a bill on Thursday reducing the age of consent for gay sex by two years to 16, throwing down a challenge to the upper house which rejected the legislation last year. Members of parliament in the House of Commons backed the reform by 263 to 102 in a free vote which allowed them to decide according to their own conscience rather than along party lines. It was the second time in just over a year that MPs had overwhelmingly backed the change. Last year their first attempt was frustrated when members of the upper chamber, the House of Lords, voted the bill down. Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour government says the law must be changed to comply with European rights obligations, and threatened to railroad the legislation through parliament if the peers try to block it once again. Already this month the House of Lords, even keener to pick a fight with Blair since he removed more than 90 percent of its hereditary peers last year, has voted down a law which would repeal a ban on school teachers promoting homosexuality. \"The issue raised in this bill is one of equality, of seeking to create a society which is free from prejudice, where our relationships with others... are based upon respect not fear,\" said Home Secretary Jack Straw, introducing the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill. Opposition Conservative Party spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe, who opposed the bill, said it was fuelled by a mistaken sense of political correctness. \"I do not believe that issues of equality should override the imperatives of protecting the young,\" Widdecombe, a matronly and proudly traditionalist figure on the Conservative benches, told parliament. She said the government's intention to lift the ban on school teachers promoting homosexuality meant lowering the age of consent for gay sex was even more misguided. \"A 16-year-old will not only be able to engage in homosexual acts, but local authorities will be able to spend public money to promote such acts,\" Widdecombe said. The bill would also bring in new measures to protect young people of both sexes under 18 from abuse of trust by teachers and care workers. The measures were included after a series of scandals involving paedophiles in schools and children's homes. Straw said the steps would protect young people in detention, in homes or under medical care, or in full time education. \"This bill is long overdue for the statute book... We need to move now to ensure equality and justice and better protection for our children and young people throughout the United Kingdom,\" Straw said.",

      "body": "<p>Next month the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in full array. In recent years the annual gathering has been regarded as a sideshow by the world's economic movers and shakers. The days of oil price shocks were over, weren't they? This year it will be different. A year ago, with the oil price on the floor at $10 a barrel, Opec agreed production cuts. Nothing new there. Opec production cuts are akin to new year's resolutions and usually last about as long. </p> <p>But Opec has kept its discipline over the past 12 months. As a result the oil price has recovered to around $27 a barrel. Little wonder then that the European Commission suggested yesterday that the forthcoming Opec meeting would be \"extremely important\". </p> <p>To date the global economy has shrugged off the impact of rising oil prices. Growth in the US appears robust and there are signs of recovery in Europe and parts of Asia. Although inflation is nudging up, it remains relatively subdued and the oil price effect should work its way through the data over the next few months. </p> <p>But theory is one thing, reality another. The EU might be confident that the economic impact of dearer oil is not what it was 25 years ago. Yet policy-makers and markets are nervous. US and European rates are on the rise. The UK chipped in with its latest contribution yesterday. Though the Japanese Nikkei reached 20,000 this week the 250-point fall on Wall Street on Wednesday night is a better illustration of the prevailing mood. </p> <p>In a sense markets are not inured to crises but they are becoming more used to them, almost to expect them. As a recent paper from the Bank for International Settlements noted somewhat understatedly: \"Both the frequency and severity of international financial crises seem to have been rising over the past 20 years or so.\" In 1997 it was south-east Asia that set off global market turbulence. The year after it was Russia's turn. Last year was crisis-free, although pessimists had fun with the millennium bug. </p> <p>Hence the EU's appeal to Opec to consider global growth in next month's deliberations. The oil producers are aware that if they overdo the curbs they will hurt themselves as well as the rest of the world. An output level which keeps oil at around, say, $20 to $22 a barrel would probably be sustainable for both producers and consumers. But setting the oil price is far from an exact science. As World Oil Trends 2000 pointed out earlier this week: \"Any small supply deficits or surpluses can dramatically affect oil commodity prices, as swings over the past two years have shown.\" </p> <p>Getting it right without spooking markets already half inclined to look for crises will be a testing task. </p> <p><strong>Conspiracy talk</strong></p> <p>As expected, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee raised interest rates yesterday but already City analysts are pencilling in another rise. The only question appears to be when. </p> <p>The MPC has shown itself more than willing to move interest rates in quick succession, to seek an incremental approach rather than shock therapy. </p> <p>But will it go next month or the month after or wait even longer? The calculation is complicated by the budget, which is due to be revealed on March 21. </p> <p>The relationship between the committee and the Treasury has been under scrutiny from the moment Gordon Brown gave the Bank of England control of monetary policy. </p> <p>The usual focus of the debate has been the extent to which Mr Brown would seek to influence the MPC's decisions and it is true that he has dropped the occasional hint. </p> <p>The area of real importance, however, is the relationship between fiscal policy and monetary policy. The problem for the MPC is that if it raises rates next month it might be accused of trying to preempt Mr Brown but if it goes a month later - after the budget - it could be seen as delivering a judgment on the chancellor's handling of his half of economic management. Conspiracy theorists will find grist for their mill either way, so the committee should simply call rates as it sees them. </p> <p><strong>Hollow protests</strong></p> <p>Philip Green's decision not to bid for Marks &amp; Spencer is no great surprise.

      "bodyText": "Next month the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in full array. In recent years the annual gathering has been regarded as a sideshow by the world's economic movers and shakers. The days of oil price shocks were over, weren't they? This year it will be different. A year ago, with the oil price on the floor at $10 a barrel, Opec agreed production cuts. Nothing new there. Opec production cuts are akin to new year's resolutions and usually last about as long. But Opec has kept its discipline over the past 12 months. As a result the oil price has recovered to around $27 a barrel. Little wonder then that the European Commission suggested yesterday that the forthcoming Opec meeting would be \"extremely important\". To date the global economy has shrugged off the impact of rising oil prices. Growth in the US appears robust and there are signs of recovery in Europe and parts of Asia. Although inflation is nudging up, it remains relatively subdued and the oil price effect should work its way through the data over the next few months. But theory is one thing, reality another. The EU might be confident that the economic impact of dearer oil is not what it was 25 years ago. Yet policy-makers and markets are nervous. US and European rates are on the rise. The UK chipped in with its latest contribution yesterday. Though the Japanese Nikkei reached 20,000 this week the 250-point fall on Wall Street on Wednesday night is a better illustration of the prevailing mood. In a sense markets are not inured to crises but they are becoming more used to them, almost to expect them. As a recent paper from the Bank for International Settlements noted somewhat understatedly: \"Both the frequency and severity of international financial crises seem to have been rising over the past 20 years or so.\" In 1997 it was south-east Asia that set off global market turbulence. The year after it was Russia's turn. Last year was crisis-free, although pessimists had fun with the millennium bug. Hence the EU's appeal to Opec to consider global growth in next month's deliberations. The oil producers are aware that if they overdo the curbs they will hurt themselves as well as the rest of the world. An output level which keeps oil at around, say, $20 to $22 a barrel would probably be sustainable for both producers and consumers. But setting the oil price is far from an exact science. As World Oil Trends 2000 pointed out earlier this week: \"Any small supply deficits or surpluses can dramatically affect oil commodity prices, as swings over the past two years have shown.\" Getting it right without spooking markets already half inclined to look for crises will be a testing task. Conspiracy talk As expected, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee raised interest rates yesterday but already City analysts are pencilling in another rise. The only question appears to be when. The MPC has shown itself more than willing to move interest rates in quick succession, to seek an incremental approach rather than shock therapy. But will it go next month or the month after or wait even longer? The calculation is complicated by the budget, which is due to be revealed on March 21. The relationship between the committee and the Treasury has been under scrutiny from the moment Gordon Brown gave the Bank of England control of monetary policy. The usual focus of the debate has been the extent to which Mr Brown would seek to influence the MPC's decisions and it is true that he has dropped the occasional hint. The area of real importance, however, is the relationship between fiscal policy and monetary policy. The problem for the MPC is that if it raises rates next month it might be accused of trying to preempt Mr Brown but if it goes a month later - after the budget - it could be seen as delivering a judgment on the chancellor's handling of his half of economic management. Conspiracy theorists will find grist for their mill either way, so the committee should simply call rates as it sees them. Hollow protests Philip Green's decision not to bid for Marks &amp; Spencer is no great surprise. There is a big difference between taking over Sears and mounting a hostile bid for M&amp;S, even at the current share price. Mr Green's protestations of shock at M&amp;S tactics ring a trifle hollow. He must have known what could happen when he let it be known he was considering a bid. The interesting fact for M&amp;S is that Mr Green's intervention did not flush out a rival. Though bid speculation is likely to continue to swirl around the retailer, new chairman Luc Vandervelde might get longer than some expected to get M&amp;S back in the City's good books.",

      "bodyText": "David Irving did not deserve to be called a historian, a leading academic told the high court yesterday. Richard Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge University, said that he was not prepared for the \"sheer depth of duplicity\" which he encountered in Mr Irving's treatment of historical sources relating to the Holocaust. Mr Irving, the 62-year-old author of Hitler's War, who is suing for libel over claims that he is a \"Holocaust denier\", said that Professor Evans's \"sweeping and rather brutal\" dismissal of his career stemmed from personal animosity. \"I think you dislike what I write and stand for and what you perceive my views to be,\" he told Prof Evans, who has been called as an expert for the defence by author Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books. Prof Evans, who has produced a 740-page report on Mr Irving's historical method, said he had no personal feelings towards him and had tried to be as objective as possible. He said he previously had little knowledge of Mr Irving's work - although he knew of his reputation as someone who was in many areas a sound historian - and was \"shocked\" at what he found. He said that the proceedings had reinforced his view in the report that Mr Irving \"has fallen so far short of the stan dards of scholarship customary among historians that he doesn't deserve to be called a historian at all\". Mr Irving said that he was \"scrupulously fair\" in everything he did in public life - \"the total opposite of being unscrupulous and manipulative and deceptive as you say in your report\". Prof Evans said he agreed that Mr Irving had a very wide knowledge of the source material for the third reich and had discovered many new documents. \"The problem for me is what you do with them when you interpret them and write them up.\" Prof Evans said that Mr Irving's published writings and speeches contained numerous statements which he regarded as \"anti-Semitic\" - to the extent that he blamed the Jews for the Holocaust. He dismissed the theory that there was a \"worldwide Jewish conspiracy\" to suppress Mr Irving's works - or undermine Germany in the 1930s - as \"a fantastic belief which has no grounds in fact\". Prof Evans said that he had examined a sufficient selection of Mr Irving's output to justify his view that he did not use acceptable methods of historical research. In his report, he said that Mr Irving had relied in the past, and continued to do so, on the fact that readers, listeners and reviewers lacked \"either the time or the expertise\" to probe deeply enough in the sources he used to discover the \"distortions and manipulations\". He accepted that people should be allowed to challenge the \"general consensus\" of history but asserted that there was a duty to conform to academic standards in the evaluation of evidence. Mr Irving, who is representing himself, is claiming damages over the 1994 Book, Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, which he says has generated waves of hatred against him. The defendants have accused him of being a liar and a falsifier of history. The hearing continues.",

They would then be given five days to collect evidence to substantiate their claim. If refused they would be able to appeal, a matter of a further four weeks.

But he said the second group, made up of their families, could face death in Afghanistan and were unlikely to be safe even in Pakistan. \"This is a desperate act by desperate men, desperate to get their families to safety. It doesn't excuse it, but it doesn't mean we can return people to a dangerous situation without very careful thought.\" The third group identified by Mr Hardwick was the rest of the passengers, who, because they could afford the \u00a312.50 fare for the internal flight - three times the average wage - showed themselves to be members of the middle class elite who had suffered the brunt of persecution by the Taliban regime. Although Amnesty International and other human rights activists stressed last night the danger of returning to the Taliban regime with its record of massacres, floggings and amputations of political opponents, immigration lawyers believed the fact that they had been on an internal flight was likely to wreck their chances of claiming asylum on the grounds that their application lacked credibility. Martin Penrose, of lawyers Winstanley Burgess, said it was likely to take a few days to interview all the applicants. They would then be given five days to collect evidence to substantiate their claim. If refused they would be able to appeal, a matter of a further four weeks. If a point of law arose the case might be referred to the immigration appeals tribunal. They would have no further rights of appeal.

      "bodyText": "Economic sanctions applied to oppressive regimes by the UK can cause as much humanitarian damage as outright war, a cross-party committee of MPs said yesterday. In a forthright attack on Britain's policy over countries including Iraq and the Yugoslav Republic, the commons international development committee said sanctions too often hurt the innocent and failed to harm the governments they were aimed at. The report, the Future of Sanctions, concludes that regional sanctions - targeted on particular areas of individual countries - have resulted in \"catastrophic humanitarian consequences\", particularly in Burundi and Sierra Leone. \"Sanctions, unless carefully targeted, have the capacity to kill more children than armed warfare,\" the report says. The committee notes that even those in favour of sanctions against Iraq \"accept that children, the ill, the vulnerable in Iraqi society are suffering\". The study, whose findings were largely backed by aid organisations but immediately challenged by the government, proposes a new approach to make sanctions \"smarter\" and more effective. It argues that the international community should target the assets of specific groups or individuals responsible for breaches of international law, as an alternative to blanket measures which compounded suffering among ordinary people. The report recommends the establishment in the UK of an office of foreign assets control to track funds connected to the leaders of oppressive regimes. It calls for greater efforts to enforce arms embargoes and improved monitoring of the impact of sanctions. Foreign office minister Peter Hain defended the government's use of sanctions. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"Iraq's threat to the wider world has been contained for over 10 years now, and that is a significant achievement.\"",

The company's filmed entertainment division reported income of $31m (\u00a319m) against $162m in the same quarter of 1998. </p> <p>Anna and the King, the retelling of the story of a Victorian Englishwoman teaching the King of Siam's children, had proved to be this year's biggest disappointment at the box office. Group earnings were $510m, down from $556m, on revenues of $3.9bn for the quarter. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch highlighted double-digit growth in most of the group's businesses, including television, newspapers and book publishing. Its most successful shows made by 20th Century Fox Television include the X Files and The Simpsons. </p> <p>But he described the success of BSkyB, the UK pay-TV business in which News Corp has a 40% stake, as \"bittersweet\". The launch of Sky Digital has driven strong growth in subscriber numbers which have reached 4m in Britain but acquisition costs, including the free set-top box offer, pushed BSkyB into the red in the first half of the year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation yesterday said the merger of Time Warner and internet business America Online had failed to persuade him to link with a similar new media company. Shares in News Corp have increased in value by 50% since the Time Warner-AOL deal in anticipation of a tie-up but Mr Murdoch said the company had put well in place its own strategy for capitalising on the internet. \"We have built and are building a global digital platform to deliver multiple services to customers around the world,\" he said. \"In parallel, we are building multimedia, multi-revenue businesses around our core content and business categories, including news, sports, classifieds, health and entertainment.\" The worldwide success of News Corp's special-effects-laden Titanic during 1998 cast the group's second-quarter results in a poor light by comparison. The company's filmed entertainment division reported income of $31m (\u00a319m) against $162m in the same quarter of 1998. Anna and the King, the retelling of the story of a Victorian Englishwoman teaching the King of Siam's children, had proved to be this year's biggest disappointment at the box office. Group earnings were $510m, down from $556m, on revenues of $3.9bn for the quarter. Mr Murdoch highlighted double-digit growth in most of the group's businesses, including television, newspapers and book publishing. Its most successful shows made by 20th Century Fox Television include the X Files and The Simpsons. But he described the success of BSkyB, the UK pay-TV business in which News Corp has a 40% stake, as \"bittersweet\". The launch of Sky Digital has driven strong growth in subscriber numbers which have reached 4m in Britain but acquisition costs, including the free set-top box offer, pushed BSkyB into the red in the first half of the year.",

The successful QC, who endured a \u00a3450,000 pay cut to become one of \"Tony's cronies\", knows it is make or break time for his career. Groomed to eventually take over as Lord Chancellor from Derry Irvine, Charlie Falconer is battling to save his own as well as New Labour's credibility.

Blair loyalists told him to tell constituency activists that he would have sent his children to state schools if they were good enough but he told them he preferred to pay. The PM's \"eyes and ears\" in Whitehall, he sits on 14 cabinet committees and admiring colleagues acknowledge that he is a formidable opponent. Mr Blair initially appointed Lord Falconer, now 49, as solicitor-general before switching him to the cabinet office in summer 1998 to replace Peter Mandelson. He is officially charged with co-ordinating government policy and regularly speaks with his old flatmate around the corner in Downing Street.

Lord Justice William Aldous told the appeal court that in a book entitled Death of a Princess, the Harrods owner made a series of inaccurate assertions and claimed the couple were preparing for a new life together and that a conspiracy existed to kill them in order to stop their marriage. Lord Aldous made the statement in a written ruling in favour of Mr Fayed and against the Sun Newspaper. The court found the Sun was not justified in publishing still pictures of Diana and Dodi taken by a security camera at Al Fayed's Villa Windsor in Paris hours before they died in a 1997 car crash. The newspaper contended it had printed the stills to help disprove Mr Fayed's claim that his son and the princess planned to marry and set up home there. Three judges ordered Reuben Murrell, the security man who sold the stills to The Sun for \u00a340,000, to give the court \u00a320,000 in case Mr Fayed seeks damages. \u0095 The former Tory MP Neil Hamilton was yesterday told to pay \u00a3500,000 towards the legal costs of Mohamed Al Fayed following his failed libel action against him.

      "body": "<p>A 40-year trend of cuts in hospital bed numbers was pronounced over yesterday when a government report declared it impossible to meet growing health care needs by making any greater use of existing wards. </p> <p>But hopes were dashed that the long-awaited report would automatically lead to a big increase in the stock of traditional hospital beds. </p> <p>Of three options for the future set out in the consultative report, one would raise acute care bed numbers by more than 25% or 35,000 beds over the next 20 years. But a second would raise them less than 6% - 8000 beds - and a third, premised upon a huge expansion of community health and social care services, would mean a further cut of almost 9% - 12,000 beds. </p> <p>Signals from Whitehall suggested that the government would be most likely to steer a mid course, with modest increases in acute beds and a greater expansion of \"intermediate\" care provision for elderly patients no longer needing acute care but not fit enough to go home. </p> <p>Alan Milburn, health secretary, said: \"What really counts is what we have got across the whole health care system. Everybody falls into the trap of looking at the hospital in isolation from the rest.\" </p> <p>The report, by a team led by Clive Smee, chief economic adviser at the department of health, shows that the number of general and acute hospital beds in England fell from 219,000 in 1970 to 136,000 early last year. </p> <p>Contrary to widespread belief, the report shows that acute beds have not been cut any faster than have those in other leading industrial countries - although the NHS has consistently had fewer beds than average. </p> <p>The team also concludes that there is no clear link between greater bed availability and an individual hospital's ability to respond better to emergency pressures - although low availability is associated with longer queues for routine operations. </p> <p>In the short term, the report projects a need for a marginal increase in beds by 2004. The number of general and acute beds should rise 2,000 (1.5%) to 138,000 and the number of beds in the health and social care system as a whole - including care homes - should rise 4,000 (0.7%) to 576,000. </p> <p>Beyond that, the three alternative options would all mean an increase in overall bed numbers, taking the total to between 582,000 and 629,000, but the number of general and acute beds would rise either to 144,000 or 171,000, or fall to 124,000. </p> <p>All the options would demand more care workers, though in greatly differing combinations. The alternative requiring fewest beds would mean 10,000 more GPs and a near doubling of district nurses and home helps. </p> <p>By contrast, the option providing for most beds would need only 4,000 extra GPs and very little, if any, change in numbers of community health and care staff. </p> <p>Mr Milburn said the report, which is open for consultation until May 15, marked \"a distinct break with the past\". Without pre-judging the consultation, the idea that \"beds are bad\" had been buried. </p> <p>\"My personal view is that as far as hospital beds are concerned, it doesn't seem viable to go on reducing them in the way that has been happening in the last few decades.\" </p> <p>The report was widely welcomed. The NHS Confederation, representing health authorities and trusts, said the findings endorsed its warnings during the recent flu outbreak that hospitals now had too little excess capacity to cope with peaks of demand. </p> <p>Nigel Edwards, the confederation's policy director, said: \"The NHS needs the ability to bring beds on line during periods of high demand.\" </p> <p>Donna Covey, director of the Association of Community Health Councils, said she hoped the report would trigger a debate on the long term future of the health service. \"The shortage of beds identified in this report is not just about furniture, but about staffing issues.\" </p> <p>Liam Fox, Conservative shadow health secretary, said: \"If the government are serious about restoring bed numbers, Alan Milburn must begin by guaranteeing that no beds will be lost by any health authority as a result of the governmment's failure to fund the pay award for doctors and nurses.\"</p>",

Everybody falls into the trap of looking at the hospital in isolation from the rest.\" The report, by a team led by Clive Smee, chief economic adviser at the department of health, shows that the number of general and acute hospital beds in England fell from 219,000 in 1970 to 136,000 early last year. Contrary to widespread belief, the report shows that acute beds have not been cut any faster than have those in other leading industrial countries - although the NHS has consistently had fewer beds than average. The team also concludes that there is no clear link between greater bed availability and an individual hospital's ability to respond better to emergency pressures - although low availability is associated with longer queues for routine operations. In the short term, the report projects a need for a marginal increase in beds by 2004. The number of general and acute beds should rise 2,000 (1.5%) to 138,000 and the number of beds in the health and social care system as a whole - including care homes - should rise 4,000 (0.7%) to 576,000. Beyond that, the three alternative options would all mean an increase in overall bed numbers, taking the total to between 582,000 and 629,000, but the number of general and acute beds would rise either to 144,000 or 171,000, or fall to 124,000. All the options would demand more care workers, though in greatly differing combinations. The alternative requiring fewest beds would mean 10,000 more GPs and a near doubling of district nurses and home helps. By contrast, the option providing for most beds would need only 4,000 extra GPs and very little, if any, change in numbers of community health and care staff. Mr Milburn said the report, which is open for consultation until May 15, marked \"a distinct break with the past\". Without pre-judging the consultation, the idea that \"beds are bad\" had been buried. \"My personal view is that as far as hospital beds are concerned, it doesn't seem viable to go on reducing them in the way that has been happening in the last few decades.\" The report was widely welcomed. The NHS Confederation, representing health authorities and trusts, said the findings endorsed its warnings during the recent flu outbreak that hospitals now had too little excess capacity to cope with peaks of demand. Nigel Edwards, the confederation's policy director, said: \"The NHS needs the ability to bring beds on line during periods of high demand.\" Donna Covey, director of the Association of Community Health Councils, said she hoped the report would trigger a debate on the long term future of the health service. \"The shortage of beds identified in this report is not just about furniture, but about staffing issues.\" Liam Fox, Conservative shadow health secretary, said: \"If the government are serious about restoring bed numbers, Alan Milburn must begin by guaranteeing that no beds will be lost by any health authority as a result of the governmment's failure to fund the pay award for doctors and nurses.\"",

Annual reports for the time he was there do not list him among the vice-presidents. \u0095 Why was he described as \"heading a team of six directors managing a team of up to 2,000 people\"? Company management structures preclude directors being in charge of other directors. \u0095 Why was he said to have been \"awarded an MBA at Sciences-Po (college) Paris achieving the top position in his class\"? The college has confirmed that he came second. \u0095 Why was his salary in the region of \u00a335,000 when he finished at Disney? \u0095 Why was he \"let go\" by Disney in 1998 to enrol on the MBA course and then not re-employed upon graduation? \u0095 Why did it take him five months to find a job after finishing the course?",

Such sentiments reveal a young Israel that has no answer to the question: \"Why are we in Lebanon?\" and wants no more of an endless war in a zone which could have been designed expressly to demonstrate the limitations of military power.</p> <p>The Israelis effectively annexed this slice of Arab territory in 1984 as they withdrew after the Lebanon war. It became a theatre in which the Israelis and their south Lebanese allies contended with the increasingly well-equipped Hizbullah militia, which also developed over those years into a political and social movement throughout Lebanon. The zone has been as much fly paper for Israel's own young men as it has been a deterrent to attacks on northern Israel. Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, is committed to withdrawal from Lebanon by this summer with or without a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. But he desperately needs that agreement because, without it, withdrawal might simply set the stage for a new war on the border with Hizbullah.</p> <p>Peace with Syria is of course a prize whose value goes far beyond ending the bloodletting in the security zone. Together with a consequential agreement with the Lebanese and with a final settlement with the Palestinians, it would complete the long, halting movement away from war that began with the Israeli-Egyptian peace in 1979. It would not end hostility between Arabs and Israelis, but, especially if the Palestinian settlement is crafted more justly than at the moment seems likely, it would make the Middle East a more comfortable place for Israel. For Syria, peace is almost equally desirable. The loss of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war compromised the legitimacy of a regime which had spoken grandly of liberating all Palestine but instead failed to protect its own territory, and Hafez Assad inherited that problem when he became undisputed Syrian leader. By the early 90s, after the Russians ceased to be a factor, it was clear to him that the Golan could only be restored to Syrian rule through a new relationship between Syria and the United States and a settlement with Israel. For America an Israeli-Syrian bargain would crown years of mediation efforts, and it would help sustain President Clinton's claim to have been successful in international affairs, and, by extension, buttress Gore's campaign.</p> <p>If Barak, Assad, and Clinton all want a peace agreement, why are we in the present mess? The talks that began hopefully, if belatedly, in Washington in December had by January been suspended by Israel, on the grounds, apparently, that Syria would not discuss issues of security and water until absolute clarity had been achieved on the territory it would receive in the event of an agreement. The Israelis want arrangements on permitted military deployments and on surveillance which would make surprise attack difficult, and they want a bargain on the Golan's substantial water resources. The Syrians see Israel's demands on these matters as excessive, but in any case will not talk in detail until the territorial issue is locked up. The suspension was followed by a sudden flurry of Hizbullah attacks, and those attacks led to Israeli retaliation, including the bombing of Lebanese power stations.</p> <p>There is controversy over who broke the \"rules\" of engagement between Hizbullah and the Israelis. This code permits action against military targets, as long as it is not launched from civilian settlements, and forbids action against civilian targets inside and outside the zone, like Israeli towns, or Lebanese power stations. Israel may or may not be right in saying that Hizbullah attacks came from villages, which would be a violation, but most agree that the Israeli reaction was grossly disproportionate. A round of hostilities could develop which would diminish the chances that the negotiations will resume. A peace which had seemed close might then be added to the Middle East's long list of \"missed opportunities\", for Clinton will soon be a lame duck even in foreign affairs, Assad is ailing, and Barak has been weakened by scandal, as has his ally on Syrian peace, President Ezer Weizman.</p> <p>It is hard to believe that Syria was completely unaware of Hizbullah's dispositions. But Damascus did not necessarily plan the attacks as a means of putting pressure on the Barak government. Hizbullah has had new weapons from Iran, its other outside patron, in recent months. The arrival of new weapons with better range and penetration could, conceivably, have set all this off as Hizbullah fighters saw and seized tactical opportunities.</p> <p>There is another explanation. US intelligence, according to the Washington Post, has noted a pattern of increased Iranian support for both Hizbullah and Hamas consistent with an effort to disrupt the peace process. As usual with Iran, such actions are rarely undertaken by the whole government, and they could even be part of the manoeuvring over elections there. It would not be the first time the Iranians have acted in such a way. Their encouragement of Hizbullah and Hamas in 1996 helped bury an earlier effort to achieve an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement.</p> <p>One of those involved in that effort was Itamar Rabinovich, the chief Israeli negotiator. He wrote later, in his study of why the four years of negotiations between 1992 and 1996 failed, that \"for adversaries like Israel and Syria to make the difficult decisions that produce an agreement, a combination of pain and hope is required. The pain makes the status quo unbearable, the hope and vision of a better future facilitate the decision\".</p> <p>This time round there is both more pain and more hope, and thus a better chance of success. But Rabinovich also marked a difficulty touching both sides, which is that peace has to be presented to the public in each country in a way that meets their preoccupations and prejudices, or as he put it with regard to the Syrians, with \"a very particular definition of peace and the procedure that led to it\". What the two sides demand, in other words, may be less what they objectively need than what they think their publics can bear. Syria's preoccupation with territory and sovereignty clashes with Israel's preoccupation with highly visible arrangements for security. It may well be possible to close off the present round of violence and get back to the table, but unless these critical differences of presentation can be finessed, what both countries want may nevertheless continue to elude them.</p> <p>The Brink Of Peace by Itamar Rabinovich is published by Princeton University Press.</p>",

But the home secretary was also warned by human rights groups that the Taliban regime's record of massacres, executions and amputations of political opponents meant he should give careful consideration to each case. It could take eight weeks to decide the fate of those hostages who apply for asylum but the process may drag on for months if cases become bogged down in repeated appeals.</p> <p>Home office sources confirmed there will be difficulties in persuading a third country to take them and some lawyers may allege that Mr Straw's Commons statement yesterday prejudged their legal cases.</p> <p>\"While I must act in accordance with the law, I am determined that nobody should consider that there can be any benefit to be obtained by hijacking,\" he told MPs.</p> <p>\"Subject to compliance with the legal requirements I would wish to see removed from this country all those on the plane as soon as practicable. This was an internal flight from Kabul to Mazer-e-Sharif, a small centre without any connections anywhere outside Afghanistan. In such circumstances it seems inconceivable that persons on the flight intended to claim political asylum unless of course they were complicit in the hijacking.\"</p> <p>The 21 people arrested yesterday for being directly involved in the hijacking were last night being questioned by Essex police. Some face a life sentence in a British prison. The remaining 130 passengers were being cared for and interviewed by police at the Stansted Hilton hotel across the road from the hijacked aeroplane. All are being treated as potential witnesses for any criminal prosecutions and police said there could be more arrests.</p> <p>Sixty people and 14 of their dependents yesterday announced their intention to seek asylum. Another 72 of the passengers \"have not yet made their wishes clear,\" the home office said.</p> <p>A Kampuchea Air plane is expected to fly from Bangkok to return those former hostages who want to go back to Afghanistan, although no firm timetable has been fixed.</p> <p>Police were still trying to establish whether the former passengers of the Ariana jet include members of a 35-strong family who were reportedly on their way to a wedding in northern Afghanistan.</p> <p>Sources said some of those arrested had been pointed out by other passengers. Others gave themselves up as members of the hijack team, which until yesterday was believed by police to number between six and 10. But there are suspicions that some of those who identified themselves as being involved with the hijacking may have done so because they believed it would be easier to claim asylum.</p> <p>The 727 jet remained on the tarmac at Stansted last night and was undergoing forensic examination. Police found four handguns, one knuckle-duster, two grenades and two detonators on board.</p> <p>Essex police were jubilant about the peaceful resolution of the hijacking crisis, the third major one at Stansted, London's designated hijacking airport, since 1982.</p> <p>Police negotiators were in almost constant contact with the hijackers since the plane arrived at Stansted at 2.01am on Monday.</p> <p>About 190 people, including 15 crew, boarded the plane at Kabul at 5.30am, British time, on Sunday. The plane was hijacked shortly afterwards and taken to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Moscow, before leaving for London on Sunday night.</p> <p>When the plane arrived at Stansted, 164 people were on board. Before yesterday, 10 had been released by negotiation and four crew, including the captain, had escaped.</p>",

But the home secretary was also warned by human rights groups that the Taliban regime's record of massacres, executions and amputations of political opponents meant he should give careful consideration to each case. It could take eight weeks to decide the fate of those hostages who apply for asylum but the process may drag on for months if cases become bogged down in repeated appeals. Home office sources confirmed there will be difficulties in persuading a third country to take them and some lawyers may allege that Mr Straw's Commons statement yesterday prejudged their legal cases. \"While I must act in accordance with the law, I am determined that nobody should consider that there can be any benefit to be obtained by hijacking,\" he told MPs. \"Subject to compliance with the legal requirements I would wish to see removed from this country all those on the plane as soon as practicable. This was an internal flight from Kabul to Mazer-e-Sharif, a small centre without any connections anywhere outside Afghanistan. In such circumstances it seems inconceivable that persons on the flight intended to claim political asylum unless of course they were complicit in the hijacking.\" The 21 people arrested yesterday for being directly involved in the hijacking were last night being questioned by Essex police. Some face a life sentence in a British prison. The remaining 130 passengers were being cared for and interviewed by police at the Stansted Hilton hotel across the road from the hijacked aeroplane. All are being treated as potential witnesses for any criminal prosecutions and police said there could be more arrests. Sixty people and 14 of their dependents yesterday announced their intention to seek asylum. Another 72 of the passengers \"have not yet made their wishes clear,\" the home office said. A Kampuchea Air plane is expected to fly from Bangkok to return those former hostages who want to go back to Afghanistan, although no firm timetable has been fixed. Police were still trying to establish whether the former passengers of the Ariana jet include members of a 35-strong family who were reportedly on their way to a wedding in northern Afghanistan. Sources said some of those arrested had been pointed out by other passengers. Others gave themselves up as members of the hijack team, which until yesterday was believed by police to number between six and 10. But there are suspicions that some of those who identified themselves as being involved with the hijacking may have done so because they believed it would be easier to claim asylum. The 727 jet remained on the tarmac at Stansted last night and was undergoing forensic examination. Police found four handguns, one knuckle-duster, two grenades and two detonators on board. Essex police were jubilant about the peaceful resolution of the hijacking crisis, the third major one at Stansted, London's designated hijacking airport, since 1982. Police negotiators were in almost constant contact with the hijackers since the plane arrived at Stansted at 2.01am on Monday. About 190 people, including 15 crew, boarded the plane at Kabul at 5.30am, British time, on Sunday. The plane was hijacked shortly afterwards and taken to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Moscow, before leaving for London on Sunday night. When the plane arrived at Stansted, 164 people were on board. Before yesterday, 10 had been released by negotiation and four crew, including the captain, had escaped.",

This economic toll on Israel was reported to be $2.4m (\u00a31.5m) a day - small compared with Lebanon's endless ordeal, but significant for a society accustomed to much lower levels of pain.</p> <p>And Hizbullah's discipline denied Israel the pretext to unleash its air force on even more devastating raids. \"Actually,\" confided a Unifil official, \"I think the Israelis didn't like the unexpected restraint at all.\"</p> <p>Barring a breakthrough in the peace process, the only way, Unifil believes, that Israel can break a cycle of violence which, unchecked, risks turning any withdrawal into a humiliating shambles, is to secure a change in the \"rules\", making even military targets off-limits for Hizbullah. It is pressing for that.</p> <p>The other way is to break the rules more drastically than the power stations blitz. Indeed, the deputy defence minister, Ephraim Sneh, yesterday asserted that Israel \"has changed the rules\". But it would have to use far greater force to make a unilateral withdrawal safe. \"They'll have to hit Hizbullah, Lebanon, and Syria-in-Lebanon,\" said a Unifil official,\"so very hard that they dare not raise their heads for another 20 years.\"</p>",

And Hizbullah's discipline denied Israel the pretext to unleash its air force on even more devastating raids. \"Actually,\" confided a Unifil official, \"I think the Israelis didn't like the unexpected restraint at all.\" Barring a breakthrough in the peace process, the only way, Unifil believes, that Israel can break a cycle of violence which, unchecked, risks turning any withdrawal into a humiliating shambles, is to secure a change in the \"rules\", making even military targets off-limits for Hizbullah. It is pressing for that. The other way is to break the rules more drastically than the power stations blitz. Indeed, the deputy defence minister, Ephraim Sneh, yesterday asserted that Israel \"has changed the rules\". But it would have to use far greater force to make a unilateral withdrawal safe. \"They'll have to hit Hizbullah, Lebanon, and Syria-in-Lebanon,\" said a Unifil official,\"so very hard that they dare not raise their heads for another 20 years.\"",

Two accounts are published in this week's Lancet medical journal warning that it is dangerous to assume complementary remedies are safe and will not interact with medicinal drugs. Two Swiss heart transplant patients in their early 60s found their bodies began to reject the new organs when they took St John's wort for mild depression, one on the advice of a psychiatrist. In each case, write Frank Ruschitzka and colleagues at the university hospital in Zurich, the patient was admitted for tests after three weeks on the herbal remedy. Doctors eventually found that the St John's wort was lowering the level of cyclosporin, an anti-rejection drug, in the blood.

He has backed the push towards devolution at every turn. No longer. Mr McGimpsey, 47, a father of four, says: \"We have got to the point where enough is enough. We have done absolutely everything asked of us, and still we are waiting on republicans. \"I still believe the [Good Friday] agreement can work. But the institutions are worthless if the foundations are false. Everyone has to live up to their obligations, just as we have lived up to ours.\" Mr McGimpsey's ties to the party are strong. His father was a councillor in Newtonards, Co Down, and he attended his first meeting when he was 12, three years before the Troubles started.

      "bodyText": "Britain has been dealt a humiliating blow by the Japanese government, which is insisting that a consignment of suspect nuclear fuel is returned to Sellafield. Tokyo's decision is a blow for senior British trade representatives, who have spent the past week apologising on behalf of British Nuclear Fuels. The UK firm drew the ire of Japan at the end of last year, when it admitted that its workers fabricated safety data for a shipment of mixed-oxide fuel due to be used in Japanese reactors. The brusque reply to British pleas for a second chance may also be a killer blow for a new \u00a3300m reprocessing plant that BNFL has built, but is still waiting for permission to open. The UK government delegation, headed by Anna Walker, director general in charge of energy at the trade and industry department, expressed \"deep regret\" at the falsification. But the Japanese government reply, issued late last night, said: \"In our view, the UK side is responsible for what happened to the fuel. We have requested that Britain send the fuel back to the UK.\" For the first time this represents government support for Kansai Electric, a local power company that is the biggest single client of BNFL's reprocessing business. Last month Kansai Electric called for the suspect fuel to be returned to Sellafield, a scenario that Britain has done everything in its power to resist because it will cost millions of pounds, raise safety concerns and stir up another diplomatic storm among countries on the route. On its journey to Japan last September the shipment raised protests from anti-nuclear campaigners and Pacific nations. They expressed fears that the weapons-grade nuclear cargo could cause an environmental catastrophe or be the target of terrorists. The response is another setback for BNFL's new reprocessing plant in Sellafield, which must prove that it is commercially viable to win an operating licence. Japanese companies were expected to account for more than half of the business of the plant. With French and Belgian reprocessing companies waiting in the wings, BNFL's chances of rescuing its relations with Japan are fading fast. Next Friday the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate will issue its final report on how the fabrication scandal happened and what its safety implications might be. If, as looks likely, the report states that the falsified data raised quality rather than safety concerns, a gleam of hope will remain for BNFL.",

      "bodyText": "An eight-year-old girl who died of E coli poisoning could have caught the infection from sewage discharged into the sea near the beach where she played, an inquest heard yesterday. Heather Preen, from Rednal, Birmingham, died on August 8 last year, two weeks after contracting E coli 0157 while on a family holiday at Dawlish Warren, in Devon. The youngster played on a beach awarded the EU blue flag for cleanliness after travelling to the resort with her parents and sister, Suzanne, 10, on July 24. She became ill with diarrhoea and blood loss a week later. She was prescribed anti-sickness tablets by a GP and later admitted to the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital. Heather was transferred to Bristol Children's hospital, where her parents agreed to switch off her life support machine after she suffered brain damage and kidney failure. Heather was one of four primary cases of E coli 0157 contracted at the resort, who were linked by the fact that all four people visited the same beach on the same day, July 28, the inquest at Teignmouth heard. The environment agency had received complaints on July 22 and 24 as well as one on July 29, about sewage discharges at the Black Bridge combined sewer overflow - two kilometres from the beach - last July, the hearing was told. Heather Barker, the agency's environmental protection manager for East Devon, said that it was \"possible but unlikely\" that any solids released from the overflow had reached the beach at Dawlish Warren. The Preen family swam in the sea covered by the blue flag cleanliness and safety certificate but, because the beach was busy, had sat on a section not covered by the award on to which dogs were allowed. The hearing was shown a video of a BBC documentary which featured the girl's parents, Mark and Julie Preen, returning to the beach three months after the death of their daughter. A tearful Mrs Preen, 32, said: \"She was the heart and soul of us. Now that she is dead something is gone. It was like a bomb blast - one minute she was standing next to me and the next was total devastation.\" On the video, a microbiologist, Professor Hugh Pennington, Britain's foremost expert on the disease, said that if someone wanted to design a \"nasty bug\", E coli 0157 would be it, as eating only a microscopic amount of contaminated soil could kill. He said that a theory suggesting that dog faeces could have been the source was \"as good as he had heard and possibly better\". But giving evidence, Mr Preen, 37, said that he was \"very sceptical\" because he did not see any dog faeces on the beach. He said that his family had jumped across an open sewage outfall, with a smelly puddle and pieces of toilet tissue at the bottom, on their way to the beach. He said that he also saw sanitary towels on the beach. Mrs Preen criticised the health team investigating the outbreak for asking questions about what the family had eaten but not about environmental matters. South and West Devon health authority failed to identify the source of the E coli outbreak, despite tests of sea water, sand and seagull droppings as well as local food outlets, the hearing was told. The Preens, who have set up a trust to raise money for research into a cure for E coli, called for a database of E coli incidents. The couple condemned Teignmouth council last week for applying to keep the beach's blue flag award. The hearing continues.",

A report in Labour Market Trends, published by the office for national statistics, acknowledges that part of the gap may be down to other factors, mainly the fact that many black and Asian young people live in inner city areas where the chance of finding work is lower for everyone.</p> <p>But it concludes that \"if higher qualifications are an indicator of better employability, one might expect that ethnic minority participants should actually do better than whites\".</p> <p>Paul Convery, director of the unemployment unit, said the imbalance between ethnic minority and white participants partly reflected \"widespread discrimination\" in the wider labour market, though the gap was significantly less on the scheme than in the open market.</p> <p>The government yesterday moved to stress efforts to achieve equality under the scheme. The employment minister, Tessa Jowell, yesterday said the government was working with equality groups and employers to prepare a campaign to persuade employers that \"diversity pays\".</p> <p>Details of racial discrepancies under the new deal emerged as the government moved to toughen the flagship scheme with plans to cut benefits for up to six months for young people who turn down three offers of training or jobs.</p> <p>The plan immediately provoked concerns.

A government analysis of the progress of ethnic minority trainees taking part in the programme reveals that they are eight percentage points less likely than white youngsters to move into work, though once in work they are more likely to stay there rather than drop out. A report in Labour Market Trends, published by the office for national statistics, acknowledges that part of the gap may be down to other factors, mainly the fact that many black and Asian young people live in inner city areas where the chance of finding work is lower for everyone. But it concludes that \"if higher qualifications are an indicator of better employability, one might expect that ethnic minority participants should actually do better than whites\". Paul Convery, director of the unemployment unit, said the imbalance between ethnic minority and white participants partly reflected \"widespread discrimination\" in the wider labour market, though the gap was significantly less on the scheme than in the open market. The government yesterday moved to stress efforts to achieve equality under the scheme. The employment minister, Tessa Jowell, yesterday said the government was working with equality groups and employers to prepare a campaign to persuade employers that \"diversity pays\". Details of racial discrepancies under the new deal emerged as the government moved to toughen the flagship scheme with plans to cut benefits for up to six months for young people who turn down three offers of training or jobs. The plan immediately provoked concerns. The TUC general secretary, John Monks, warned that, faced with six months without benefit, many young people would turn to crime.",

But for me EastEnders has often been as memorable for its comical, even surreal moments. Surely not, I hear you cry? Not humour in that dull, dank Square of misery? Apart, of course, from Pat Butcher's choice of earrings. </p> <p>Look a little closer, however, among those moments of high passion and drama, and you may be surprised. What about those endless far-fetched theme nights in the Vic? The Wild West evening with Pete Beale in a Stetson as wide as his toothy grin, while his son Ian emerged breathless out the back of a pantomime horse and Wicksy pretended he could actually play the pub piano. Or the Caribbean cocktail extravaganza with Bianca turning up as Carmen Miranda, the contents of Mark's fruit and veg stall finely balanced on her head. </p> <p>Far-out costumes haven't ended there. Remember Arthur dressed as a baby being pushed round the Square in a pram by Pete and Den? No one could forget Sanjay's teddy boy quiff at the community play - it nearly had someone's eye out. And even the normally down-to-earth Michelle once turned up in a tie-dye kaftan to impress her mate Rachel's middle-class friends. </p> <p>From fashion shows to slug races, eel fishing to sculpture exhibitions in Kath's caff, EastEnders has always caused hilarity to millions precisely because humour often sits so uncomfortably with the Greek tragedies that surround it. That isn't to say the writers can't write comedy. The likes of Tony Jordan, Tony MacHale and Annie Wood can lay down patter as good as any sitcom, but their best one-liners are normally overshadowed by news of someone bombing the Arches or burning down the portakabin for the 15th time. </p> <p>Sometimes, like in all soap operas, it gets a too surreal. What did all those people mean when they said they wanted to get Dr Legover? Why did Wendy Richard go from having to hear every day about Mrs Slocombe's pussy in Are You Being Served to nursing a gin and orange in the Queen Vic listening to Ethel's complaints about her little Willie?

      "bodyText": "For some it will be Den serving Angie the divorce papers on Christmas Eve, for others it will be Grant pushing bruvver Phil down the garage pit after learning that he had slept with his wife, or maybe even Pauline smashing adulterous Arthur over the head with a frying pan. But for me EastEnders has often been as memorable for its comical, even surreal moments. Surely not, I hear you cry? Not humour in that dull, dank Square of misery? Apart, of course, from Pat Butcher's choice of earrings. Look a little closer, however, among those moments of high passion and drama, and you may be surprised. What about those endless far-fetched theme nights in the Vic? The Wild West evening with Pete Beale in a Stetson as wide as his toothy grin, while his son Ian emerged breathless out the back of a pantomime horse and Wicksy pretended he could actually play the pub piano. Or the Caribbean cocktail extravaganza with Bianca turning up as Carmen Miranda, the contents of Mark's fruit and veg stall finely balanced on her head. Far-out costumes haven't ended there. Remember Arthur dressed as a baby being pushed round the Square in a pram by Pete and Den? No one could forget Sanjay's teddy boy quiff at the community play - it nearly had someone's eye out. And even the normally down-to-earth Michelle once turned up in a tie-dye kaftan to impress her mate Rachel's middle-class friends. From fashion shows to slug races, eel fishing to sculpture exhibitions in Kath's caff, EastEnders has always caused hilarity to millions precisely because humour often sits so uncomfortably with the Greek tragedies that surround it. That isn't to say the writers can't write comedy. The likes of Tony Jordan, Tony MacHale and Annie Wood can lay down patter as good as any sitcom, but their best one-liners are normally overshadowed by news of someone bombing the Arches or burning down the portakabin for the 15th time. Sometimes, like in all soap operas, it gets a too surreal. What did all those people mean when they said they wanted to get Dr Legover? Why did Wendy Richard go from having to hear every day about Mrs Slocombe's pussy in Are You Being Served to nursing a gin and orange in the Queen Vic listening to Ethel's complaints about her little Willie? How could Felix the Barber (of the butterfly collection and holocaust tales) persuade Blossom (devoted West Indian grandmother) to emigrate with him to Israel, when they had never even kissed.

Barring any last-minute hitches on his contract, Mr Mayer, 54, is expected to take up his six-figure appointment in the summer, soon after the mayoral election in May. He takes on the duties performed by London Transport plus a wider view of the relationship with other modes of transport, such as rail. Mr Mayer will eventually take over direction of the Underground under John Prescott's private-public partnership. However, this is not expected to happen until next year when London Underground has completed the \u00a315bn deal. The plan has already been held up by Railtrack's failure to secure control of the Underground's sub-surface stations. This has delayed the project for at least six months. The government's aim is to complete the transfer by next year, but some of the consortiums bidding for the project are pressing for big sections of the Underground to be closed while they modernise track and tunnelling. Mr Mayer has been chosen because he has a wide experience of dealing with Whitehall as a civil servant during the Thatcher years. He spent five years of his Whitehall career in the department of transport and then went into banking as a director of finance and administration at NM Rothschild. This dual experience in the private and public sectors could be invaluable experience when the public-private partnership on the Underground is finally realised. Under Mr Mayer's guidance, the various consortiums will have the opportunity to run one of the world's largest metro systems for at least 15 years before it is handed back to the state. He will in effect carry out the wishes of the new mayor, advising him on key issues such as how to make buses run more freely. One of the most immediate decisions will be whether London will become the first city to respond positively to the government's proposals to introduce congestion and workplace charging to clear clogged roads. A new survey by the Institution of Civil Engineers shows fewer and fewer cities in favour of the idea. Only the London boroughs are keen on the plan. It must first be debated at borough level. The mayor and Mr Mayer will have to persuade them that the plan is not only workable but also will allow the revenue raised to be ploughed back into improving public transport in the capital.",

      "body": "<p>The death of the American radical, Jack Scott, at the age of 57, came as defence counsel were seeking his testimony in a trial that revives the notorious Patty Hearst case. To his irritation, the episode overshadowed Scott's life, and his true legacy lay in his accomplishments in the fields of race relations and sports health.</p> <p>He fought all his life against racism and drugs in sport, but it cost him dearly. During the 1970s, when blacks and women were excluded from sports management and coaching, Scott was a lonely and courageous pioneer. He wrote a book, The Athletic Revolution, that became a required text on exploitation in athletics, and established the Institute for the Study of Sport and Society in Oakland, California. Yet for years he was hounded by the FBI in a pattern of harassment of radicals that has become wearily familiar to Americans.</p> <p>Scott was born in the conservative town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to university at Stanford and Syracuse, New York, before getting his PhD in education at Berkeley. He specialised in the new subject of sociology of sport, and is now regarded as its founding father. In his early years, he was a superb sprinter, and he continued jogging into his 50s.</p> <p>Scott's politics were formed in the turbulent 60s, during which he became sports editor of the left-wing San Francisco magazine, Ramparts. But he began to make real changes when a new and liberal chancellor of Oberlin College, Ohio, appointed him as athletics director and chairman of physical education in 1972. Scott immediately hired a black football coach, the first in a non-black university in American history, then a black basketball coach, a trampoline champion, and a woman to coach women's sports - appointments the like of which were unheard of at the time.</p> <p>Amid great controversy, he next hired, as head track coach, Tommy Smith, who had created a sensation as one of two black American sprint medallists at the 1968 Olympics to raise clenched fists in a racial protest on the Mexico City podium. Smith was then a pariah in America - he was washing cars - but he turned out to be an excellent coach. The black football trainer, criticised as unqualified, fielded a Mexican-American as a key player and brought in Oberlin's first winning season for 25 years - the college has not had another since.</p> <p>A conservative faction gained power and Scott was forced out of Oberlin, but not before he had broken the coaching colour barrier in American collegiate athletics. Back in Berkeley, with his lifelong partner Micki, he befriended survivors of the urban guerrilla group, the Symbionese Liberation Army, after six members were burned to death in a shocking 1974 police shoot-out in Los Angeles.</p> <p>The group had earlier kidnapped the newspaper heiress Patty Hearst from Berkeley. Fearing more deaths on both sides, Scott smuggled Hearst and two comrades to a secret address on the other side of the country after persuading them to disarm. They stayed together for months, and Scott later said that Hearst had been an eager SLA convert and had declined his offer to let her go. \"Patty was a rebel,\" he asserted.</p> <p>At that time, Scott also met Kathy Soliah, who in 1975 allegedly placed bombs under two police cars to avenge an SLA friend who had died in the Los Angeles blaze. The bombs did not explode. Last year, police arrested Sara Jane Olson, a middle-aged mother and doctor's wife in Minnesota, and unmasked her as Soliah. She is to go on trial later this year, and Scott was to have given evidence, although prosecutors had successfully delayed a request to videotape his testimony.</p> <p>For years after the SLA episode, Scott was blacklisted in academia and was even refused a job at a steelworks. Both the FBI and the media harassed him, but he was never charged with assisting the SLA fugitives. \"He challenged the FBI to try him,\" said Micki Scott, who married Jack last January. \"But they feared what would come out in a trial and backed down.\"</p> <p>Scott finally got a job treating sports injuries with a new therapy technique that used a micro-current machine called a myomatic.

      "bodyText": "The death of the American radical, Jack Scott, at the age of 57, came as defence counsel were seeking his testimony in a trial that revives the notorious Patty Hearst case. To his irritation, the episode overshadowed Scott's life, and his true legacy lay in his accomplishments in the fields of race relations and sports health. He fought all his life against racism and drugs in sport, but it cost him dearly. During the 1970s, when blacks and women were excluded from sports management and coaching, Scott was a lonely and courageous pioneer. He wrote a book, The Athletic Revolution, that became a required text on exploitation in athletics, and established the Institute for the Study of Sport and Society in Oakland, California. Yet for years he was hounded by the FBI in a pattern of harassment of radicals that has become wearily familiar to Americans. Scott was born in the conservative town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to university at Stanford and Syracuse, New York, before getting his PhD in education at Berkeley. He specialised in the new subject of sociology of sport, and is now regarded as its founding father. In his early years, he was a superb sprinter, and he continued jogging into his 50s. Scott's politics were formed in the turbulent 60s, during which he became sports editor of the left-wing San Francisco magazine, Ramparts. But he began to make real changes when a new and liberal chancellor of Oberlin College, Ohio, appointed him as athletics director and chairman of physical education in 1972. Scott immediately hired a black football coach, the first in a non-black university in American history, then a black basketball coach, a trampoline champion, and a woman to coach women's sports - appointments the like of which were unheard of at the time. Amid great controversy, he next hired, as head track coach, Tommy Smith, who had created a sensation as one of two black American sprint medallists at the 1968 Olympics to raise clenched fists in a racial protest on the Mexico City podium. Smith was then a pariah in America - he was washing cars - but he turned out to be an excellent coach. The black football trainer, criticised as unqualified, fielded a Mexican-American as a key player and brought in Oberlin's first winning season for 25 years - the college has not had another since. A conservative faction gained power and Scott was forced out of Oberlin, but not before he had broken the coaching colour barrier in American collegiate athletics. Back in Berkeley, with his lifelong partner Micki, he befriended survivors of the urban guerrilla group, the Symbionese Liberation Army, after six members were burned to death in a shocking 1974 police shoot-out in Los Angeles. The group had earlier kidnapped the newspaper heiress Patty Hearst from Berkeley. Fearing more deaths on both sides, Scott smuggled Hearst and two comrades to a secret address on the other side of the country after persuading them to disarm. They stayed together for months, and Scott later said that Hearst had been an eager SLA convert and had declined his offer to let her go. \"Patty was a rebel,\" he asserted. At that time, Scott also met Kathy Soliah, who in 1975 allegedly placed bombs under two police cars to avenge an SLA friend who had died in the Los Angeles blaze. The bombs did not explode. Last year, police arrested Sara Jane Olson, a middle-aged mother and doctor's wife in Minnesota, and unmasked her as Soliah. She is to go on trial later this year, and Scott was to have given evidence, although prosecutors had successfully delayed a request to videotape his testimony. For years after the SLA episode, Scott was blacklisted in academia and was even refused a job at a steelworks. Both the FBI and the media harassed him, but he was never charged with assisting the SLA fugitives. \"He challenged the FBI to try him,\" said Micki Scott, who married Jack last January. \"But they feared what would come out in a trial and backed down.\" Scott finally got a job treating sports injuries with a new therapy technique that used a micro-current machine called a myomatic. He and Micki became international distributors of the device, and formed a successful clinic in Eugene, Oregon, America's athletics capital. He also published scores of magazine articles dealing with the abuse of drugs in sport and its racism. Among athletes he treated for injuries was Carl Lewis, the Olympic champion runner and jumper. Scott is survived by his wife and their three children. \u0095 Jack Scott, sports administrator and healer, born March 3 1942; died February 6 2000",

In Vermont, a state supreme court ruling that gay relationships should be accorded equal status to heterosexual ones could make Vermont the first state in the country where gay marriages are legally recognised. A US district court judge in Santa Ana, California, has ruled that schoolchildren in Orange county are entitled to hold meetings of Gay-Straight Alliance clubs on school premises. This is seen as a breakthrough for the groups which number more than 600 nationwide. The clubs, which homosexual and heterosexual students belong to, were formed as an act of solidarity with gay teenagers who suffered persecution. According to members, their meetings are mainly social. A number of school districts have banned meetings by them at schools.

But there is no cheering from the inmates at Trapani, where it all began.</p> <p>Crammed 15 to a cell, unable to phone home and ignorant of their fate, they hear hammering and smell fresh paint - and guess, correctly, that this jail is to be expanded, not closed.</p> <p>The Mediterranean, which carried them here, laps 200m (650ft) away. But through their bars they see only guards with machineguns and the rooftops of Trapani, a town on Sicily's western tip.</p> <p>The December fire that killed four inmates and injured dozens more convulsed Italy with recrimination. It prompted an official inquiry, published this week, which yielded a charter of living conditions and the promise to close two of the country's 11 immigrant jails, which were opened only two years ago.</p> <p>Human rights groups are furious that the bars, guards and batons will remain in place to quell inmates, who because they have committed no crime, are officially known as \"guests\" living in \"reception centres\".</p> <p>Critics inside and outside Italy say they are little more than concentration camps. But the authorities insist that conditions are humane and that those suspected of entering the country illegally must be detained while their cases are investigated - otherwise they would melt away and never be found again.</p> <p>European Union partners are anxious that Italy, a gateway for north Africa and the Balkans, holds firm.</p> <p>But opposition to the centres is swelling. Both sides are pumping out propaganda. Further unrest could crack the government's resolve.</p> <p>To the bodies slumped inside Trapani's jail, this was news. All they knew was that the demonstrators who shouted encouragement from the street and promised to close it have failed. Another centre is being built in the town in anticipation of ever-greater numbers.</p> <p>Around 100 inmates are usually kept here. But while carpenters and painters repair damage from the fire - started deliberately by inmates in an attempt to divert guards during an attempted breakout - the number has shrunk to 49, all north African men. They are corralled in four cells on the third floor of what was built in 1927 as a retirement home.</p> <p>Two fountains, a pond, geranium plants and four police cars fill the yard. Brown, 12ft grilles have been bolted onto the third-floor balcony. Four metal doors stand between the cells and the yard. There is also an exercise yard, concrete and empty except for weeds.</p> <p>Breakfast is bread, water and coffee. Lunch and dinner is a polystyrene plate of hot meat, fish and rice delivered by charity workers and eaten in a separate dining area.</p> <p>The government tried to defuse criticism by offering to let the charities take over administration; but they refused, saying they wanted no part in repression.</p> <p>Guards patrol the balcony and are able at a glance to inspect each cell, because the facades are grilles, from which sprout dozens of hands and feet.</p> <p>Tabib Rafik, a Tunisian, paid \u00a3160 to smugglers and landed on a beach. Like his 14 cellmates, he was quickly arrested under a 1998 law passed after pressure from the EU.</p> <p>There were no jobs at home and Mr Rafik, 35, had heard there was work in Sicily as a farm labourer or, if he was lucky, in a restaurant.</p> <p>Inmates must be released or deported after 30 days. Fear that they would be sent back home, and not the living conditions, explained the four riots and repeated escape attempts, said Leonardo Cerenzia, Trapani's prefect.</p> <p>Mr Rafik and other inmates said different. The guards were not brutal, but the confinement made people desperate. Their cells had beds and toilets but little else. They felt trapped, cramped, dirty, bored and angry. One man displayed a collapsed nostril and complained that he had not been able to see a doctor.</p> <p>Of the 8,000 detained in centres last year, 44% were deported.</p> <p>\"We have not stolen anything or hurt anyone - so why are we here? We just want to work,\" said Mr Rafik.</p> <p>Critics say the centres are unconstitutional because entering Italy illegally is technically not a crime.</p> <p>Zitouni Kamel, 43, claimed he faced persecution if deported back to Algeria. Thousands of protesters demanding reform have clashed with police in Rome, Milan and Florence. Authorities accused them of political opportunism, but promised to build better centres.</p> <p>The government this week also announced that it would allow 63,000 non-EU people to enter legally this year. However, the UN estimated that Italy needs 300,000 every year just to replace its ageing workforce.</p> <p>A two-week lull in disruption has bolstered the government's claim that its policies are working and that the centres are under control.</p> <p>A guard at Trapani smiled in agreement. \"Sure, everything is quiet. At the moment.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The squalor, riots and fatal fire that triggered street battles and uprisings in Italy's immigrant jails have forced the government into announcing sweeping reforms. But there is no cheering from the inmates at Trapani, where it all began. Crammed 15 to a cell, unable to phone home and ignorant of their fate, they hear hammering and smell fresh paint - and guess, correctly, that this jail is to be expanded, not closed. The Mediterranean, which carried them here, laps 200m (650ft) away. But through their bars they see only guards with machineguns and the rooftops of Trapani, a town on Sicily's western tip. The December fire that killed four inmates and injured dozens more convulsed Italy with recrimination. It prompted an official inquiry, published this week, which yielded a charter of living conditions and the promise to close two of the country's 11 immigrant jails, which were opened only two years ago. Human rights groups are furious that the bars, guards and batons will remain in place to quell inmates, who because they have committed no crime, are officially known as \"guests\" living in \"reception centres\". Critics inside and outside Italy say they are little more than concentration camps. But the authorities insist that conditions are humane and that those suspected of entering the country illegally must be detained while their cases are investigated - otherwise they would melt away and never be found again. European Union partners are anxious that Italy, a gateway for north Africa and the Balkans, holds firm. But opposition to the centres is swelling. Both sides are pumping out propaganda. Further unrest could crack the government's resolve. To the bodies slumped inside Trapani's jail, this was news. All they knew was that the demonstrators who shouted encouragement from the street and promised to close it have failed. Another centre is being built in the town in anticipation of ever-greater numbers. Around 100 inmates are usually kept here. But while carpenters and painters repair damage from the fire - started deliberately by inmates in an attempt to divert guards during an attempted breakout - the number has shrunk to 49, all north African men. They are corralled in four cells on the third floor of what was built in 1927 as a retirement home. Two fountains, a pond, geranium plants and four police cars fill the yard. Brown, 12ft grilles have been bolted onto the third-floor balcony. Four metal doors stand between the cells and the yard. There is also an exercise yard, concrete and empty except for weeds. Breakfast is bread, water and coffee. Lunch and dinner is a polystyrene plate of hot meat, fish and rice delivered by charity workers and eaten in a separate dining area. The government tried to defuse criticism by offering to let the charities take over administration; but they refused, saying they wanted no part in repression. Guards patrol the balcony and are able at a glance to inspect each cell, because the facades are grilles, from which sprout dozens of hands and feet. Tabib Rafik, a Tunisian, paid \u00a3160 to smugglers and landed on a beach. Like his 14 cellmates, he was quickly arrested under a 1998 law passed after pressure from the EU. There were no jobs at home and Mr Rafik, 35, had heard there was work in Sicily as a farm labourer or, if he was lucky, in a restaurant. Inmates must be released or deported after 30 days. Fear that they would be sent back home, and not the living conditions, explained the four riots and repeated escape attempts, said Leonardo Cerenzia, Trapani's prefect. Mr Rafik and other inmates said different. The guards were not brutal, but the confinement made people desperate. Their cells had beds and toilets but little else. They felt trapped, cramped, dirty, bored and angry. One man displayed a collapsed nostril and complained that he had not been able to see a doctor. Of the 8,000 detained in centres last year, 44% were deported. \"We have not stolen anything or hurt anyone - so why are we here? We just want to work,\" said Mr Rafik. Critics say the centres are unconstitutional because entering Italy illegally is technically not a crime. Zitouni Kamel, 43, claimed he faced persecution if deported back to Algeria. Thousands of protesters demanding reform have clashed with police in Rome, Milan and Florence. Authorities accused them of political opportunism, but promised to build better centres. The government this week also announced that it would allow 63,000 non-EU people to enter legally this year. However, the UN estimated that Italy needs 300,000 every year just to replace its ageing workforce. A two-week lull in disruption has bolstered the government's claim that its policies are working and that the centres are under control. A guard at Trapani smiled in agreement. \"Sure, everything is quiet. At the moment.\"",

      "bodyText": "An Australian-owned gold mine in western Romania has disgorged 378,500 litres (100,000 gallons) of cyanide-contaminated water into the rivers of central Europe, triggering an ecological \"catastrophe\", according to Hungarian and European Union officials. Drinking-water supplies for 2.5m people have been threatened by the poison spill from the Aurul gold mine - near Baia Mare in the north of the country - which began 10 days ago. It is now heading downriver towards the Danube and has reached Yugoslavia. On some sections of the river Tisza, 80% of fish have died. But Esmeralda Exploration, the Perth-based company that owns 50% of the mine - 45% is owned by the Romanian government and 5% by foreign investors - has denied responsibility and claimed that reports of a disaster were \"grossly exaggerated\". Ukrainians call the river the black Tisza, as it swells from mountain stream into medium-sized river and twists through ancient willow forests, touching Slovakia before straightening and broadening out to flow due south, through Hungary. Hungarians call it the blonde Tisza, as the sand on its bed turns the water a yellow-brown. But now it is the dead Tisza. Fishermen and local volunteers have been hauling dead fish from the river in large numbers to save the river birds which normally feed off them. Candle-lit vigils have been held beside the river. The full extent of the damage may not be known until new vegetation appears in early spring. The Hungarian and Romanian environment ministers met yesterday to discuss the consequences of the accident and investigate who is responsible for it. There is no agreement on compensation for environmental damage between the two countries. Zoltan Illes, the chairman of Hungary's environment committee, accused Esmeralda Exploration of engaging in \"eco-colonisation\". \"Nature is being destroyed here in central Europe,\" he said. \"The health of hundreds of thousands is being endangered with technologies which may not be permitted in ... Australia or ... in western Europe.\" The contaminated water was first discharged on January 30 when a sewage reservoir overflowed after a heavy snowfall, with the water making its way into the river Somes. From there, the polluted water flowed west into Hungary's river Tisza. The Romanian media have since reported two other, smaller leaks of the poison and cyanide levels have been recorded at 700 times the permitted level in one river, according to the Romanian environment ministry. The Tisza flows from Hungary into Yugoslavia, where the first traces of cyanide were detected yesterday. \"The tip of the pollution spill has been monitored entering our territory,\" the Serbian agriculture, forestry and water management ministry said in a statement. \"The ministry warns all users of the waters, the population living along the banks of the river Tisza, that water cannot be used for any purposes, nor can they fish.\" By the time the poison reaches the Danube, they hope it will be sufficiently diluted not to cause further harm. The EU commissioner for transport and energy, Loyola de Palacio, held talks in Budapest with Hungary's foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, and other officials and warned that \"it's a European-dimension catastrophe\". She is to seek extra funds to help Hungary clean up the pollution. Esmeralda Exploration's chairman, Brett Montgomery, said in Perth yesterday that the incident had been grossly exaggerated and he did not expect his company to face compensation claims.",

      "bodyText": "The death of a 15-year-old aboriginal boy in custody yesterday has given a tragic boost to an international campaign being fought by churches and civil libertarians against what they describe as unjust and draconian mandatory sentencing laws. In the latest chapter of one of Australia's most acrimonious human rights debates, the unnamed orphan, who came from the remote community of Groote Eylandt, was five days away from the end of a mandatory 28-day sentence for stealing \u00a335-worth of pens and paint when he hanged himself in a Darwin juvenile detention centre. He was found unconscious with a bed sheet around his neck on Wednesday night, a correctional services spokesman said. He did not regain consciousness. The already highly sensitive issue of indigenous deaths in jails and a current senate inquiry into the controversial sentencing laws of the Northern Territory and Western Australia mean the boy's death has caused an outcry around the country. \"Today is a day of shame for all Territorians,\" said the president of the outback territory's law society, Jon Tippett, following warnings that the laws could lead to such a death. \"We stand in breach of our international obligations at law, and we stand in breach of our obligations to children.\" The North Australian aboriginal legal aid service is planning international legal action against the laws, which it says breach international human rights covenants ratified by Australia and do not deter crime. The laws have been widely condemned by human rights groups, including Amnesty International. Under the regime introduced in 1997 to counter rising crime against property, juveniles aged 15 or 16 are jailed for 28 days or sent on diversionary programmes for any second property crime. But the boy, like many aboriginal youths, lived in an isolated area where there were no programmes, and detention was the only alternative. The boy had been found guilty of breaking into an aboriginal community office and stealing pens, pencils and texts. He was also convicted of breaking into a local primary school and stealing pens and paint. Selwyn Hausman, the director of the Miwatj aboriginal legal service, said the boy's offences of petty theft and damage would not have put him in a cell were it not for the legislation. \"He was still distressed. Within the context of the communities, they [the offences] are annoying but not something to go to jail for.\" The Green party senator Bob Brown has introduced a bill to use federal powers to override the mandatory sentences. He has also spurred on the official inquiry, which is hearing evidence around the country, and wants the prime minister, John Howard, to intervene. \"While the horrible reality is we cannot restore life to this young indigenous person, the prime minister has a heavy responsibility to ensure a death doesn't occur in these circumstances,\" Mr Brown said. Last April an aboriginal man, Kevin Cook, was jailed for one year for stealing a towel, as was a 17-year-old boy for stealing a packet of biscuits - in both cases because they were their third convictions. But the Northern Territory government said the boy's death had nothing to do with mandatory sentencing and everything to do with youth suicide. It also claims the laws have not affected the rate at which aboriginal people go to jail. The Northern Territory's chief minister and attorney general, Denis Burke, said: \"We are dealing with self-destructive behaviour in youth which is very complex. To suggest this child died because of mandatory sentence is grotesque. \"We have mandatory sentencing laws up here because we treat property offences very seriously. They don't target indigenous children, and we don't believe aboriginal people should be given some separate system of justice.\"",

So it is only really trusted when marinated in the fiercest Vindaloo sauce. But, overall, the old cliched portrayal of prison food can no longer be justified. Of course, there are detractors. You can never please all of the people all of the time, and prisoners can be notoriously fickle. But some of us remember the old days when the majority of hot plates were staffed by rows of defeated-looking men with grey eyes and greyer skin who served grey food to their isotropic fellows.</p> <p>It was a time when the cabbage routinely had the genetic code boiled right out of its heart, and when the only hope you had of seeing anything green on your stainless steel tray (anything edible anyway) was to send your \u00a31 subscription to the Vegan Society and then present your membership card when it arrived to the cook by way of \"proof\" that you were a bona fide vegan, in which case you were given a modicum of lettuce and tomato every other teatime; and as a bonus they even threw in a jar of yeast extract once a week.</p> <p>Another good wheeze was to declare yourself a Mormon when asked your religion on first entering the jail. For reasons never ascertained, this entitled you to a pint of hot cocoa at suppertime, while all other religions had to make do with \"tea\" - actually a greasy, tobacco tinctured liquid served lukewarm from buckets and affectionately known as \"diesel\". You had to be quick off the mark with the Mormon wheeze, however, as \"miraculous conversions\" after tasting the diesel were greeted with little sympathy.</p> <p>As for food hygiene, one lunchtime in a northern jail I thought I noticed a foreign body in the spaghetti.</p> <p>\"What the hell's that?\" I said to the fellow with the ladle.</p> <p>\"What?\" he said, scrutinising the translucent strands from behind blue tinted glasses.</p> <p>\"That!\" I said pointing vigorously.</p> <p>He reached in to retrieve the offending object. \"Oh that?\" he said. \"It's only a matchstick. Look, it's not even been used,\" he continued gleefully, before depositing it in the top pocket of his once-white cotton serving jacket. \"I'll dry that and save it for later.\" There were no lighters in prison then and individual matches were often split into as many as eight slithers to make them last.</p> <p>In the long term jails, the introduction of \"cooking facilities\" (small kitchenettes on the end of landings) emerged as a saviour for many of those serving the heftiest sentences. On a spur, or a landing, food boats were formed, comprising three or four associates who pooled their prison wages and purchased meat and vegetables. This meant that at least two or three hearty meals a week could be enjoyed, which worked wonders for morale.</p> <p>Then things escalated. Cookery books were borrowed from the prison library and cookery classes attended in education departments. Before long, some prisoners had become adept at preparing gourmet dishes arguably on a par with many of London's West End eateries. But it was bound to end in tears. Private parties graduated into bacchanal events where (yes, it's true) lobster and steaks were regularly consumed in vast quantities, washed down with gallons of vintage \"hooch\" (illicit fermenting liquid, usually orange flavoured). The attempted breakout at Whitemoor maximum security prison in 1992 brought the situation to a head. Following the inquiry into the escape attempt and the \"revelations\" that prison officers were ferrying in hampers of luxury food in prison vans, clampdowns were ordered in jails throughout the country.</p> <p>For some years post-Whitemoor, all hungry convicts had to rely on for tucker treats at the hot plate were royal visits - or acts of God. On one occasion, a local fish farmer who had gone bust offered several hundred prime trout to the cook in a jail in which I was temporarily lodged. Most residents appreciated this unexpected gesture of benevolence, although one inmate, known as Brummie Bob, threatened to instigate a full-blown food strike if he wasn't provided with \"proper scran, right fookin' now\".</p> <p>\"But fresh trout baked whole is a delicacy,\" explained the cook.</p> <p>\"I don't give a fook,\" said Bob. \"I'm not eating fish with staring eyes.\" (This from a man who once won a cannabis joint after having been dared to eat a live beetle).</p> <p>It was inevitable that trouble at t'hot plate would increase with the proliferation of the prison population. Violent incidents spiralled, including assaults on kitchen staff, and even mini riots were not unusual in protest at being served \"anaemic chips\" or undercooked \"duff\" (a half brick of stodge covered in runny custard and alleged to be \"the sweet\").</p> <p>Thankfully, collecting a meal from the hot plate today is a much less dramatic experience. For all that, I can guess what your thinking: what about the porridge? It's still available. When I went to collect my breakfast this morning, there was a choice of Cornflakes, Branflakes, Weetabix - or porridge, along with hot, buttered toast and fresh boiling water to make a refreshing cup of tea .</p> <p>For lunch I'll be having baked fish. I've no idea what kind, but delicious - with diced carrots and petit pois. And for tea, I'll be having a stir fry, followed by peaches and jelly. Not too fancy, but really quite pleasant all the same.</p> <p>So if anyone is considering a stretch soon, I hope these words have provided a morsel of reassurance concerning at least one aspect of what may be in store. By the way, may I recommend the healthy option? And bon appetit.</p>",

You can never please all of the people all of the time, and prisoners can be notoriously fickle. But some of us remember the old days when the majority of hot plates were staffed by rows of defeated-looking men with grey eyes and greyer skin who served grey food to their isotropic fellows. It was a time when the cabbage routinely had the genetic code boiled right out of its heart, and when the only hope you had of seeing anything green on your stainless steel tray (anything edible anyway) was to send your \u00a31 subscription to the Vegan Society and then present your membership card when it arrived to the cook by way of \"proof\" that you were a bona fide vegan, in which case you were given a modicum of lettuce and tomato every other teatime; and as a bonus they even threw in a jar of yeast extract once a week. Another good wheeze was to declare yourself a Mormon when asked your religion on first entering the jail. For reasons never ascertained, this entitled you to a pint of hot cocoa at suppertime, while all other religions had to make do with \"tea\" - actually a greasy, tobacco tinctured liquid served lukewarm from buckets and affectionately known as \"diesel\". You had to be quick off the mark with the Mormon wheeze, however, as \"miraculous conversions\" after tasting the diesel were greeted with little sympathy. As for food hygiene, one lunchtime in a northern jail I thought I noticed a foreign body in the spaghetti. \"What the hell's that?\" I said to the fellow with the ladle. \"What?\" he said, scrutinising the translucent strands from behind blue tinted glasses. \"That!\" I said pointing vigorously. He reached in to retrieve the offending object. \"Oh that?\" he said. \"It's only a matchstick. Look, it's not even been used,\" he continued gleefully, before depositing it in the top pocket of his once-white cotton serving jacket. \"I'll dry that and save it for later.\" There were no lighters in prison then and individual matches were often split into as many as eight slithers to make them last. In the long term jails, the introduction of \"cooking facilities\" (small kitchenettes on the end of landings) emerged as a saviour for many of those serving the heftiest sentences. On a spur, or a landing, food boats were formed, comprising three or four associates who pooled their prison wages and purchased meat and vegetables. This meant that at least two or three hearty meals a week could be enjoyed, which worked wonders for morale. Then things escalated. Cookery books were borrowed from the prison library and cookery classes attended in education departments. Before long, some prisoners had become adept at preparing gourmet dishes arguably on a par with many of London's West End eateries. But it was bound to end in tears. Private parties graduated into bacchanal events where (yes, it's true) lobster and steaks were regularly consumed in vast quantities, washed down with gallons of vintage \"hooch\" (illicit fermenting liquid, usually orange flavoured). The attempted breakout at Whitemoor maximum security prison in 1992 brought the situation to a head. Following the inquiry into the escape attempt and the \"revelations\" that prison officers were ferrying in hampers of luxury food in prison vans, clampdowns were ordered in jails throughout the country. For some years post-Whitemoor, all hungry convicts had to rely on for tucker treats at the hot plate were royal visits - or acts of God. On one occasion, a local fish farmer who had gone bust offered several hundred prime trout to the cook in a jail in which I was temporarily lodged. Most residents appreciated this unexpected gesture of benevolence, although one inmate, known as Brummie Bob, threatened to instigate a full-blown food strike if he wasn't provided with \"proper scran, right fookin' now\". \"But fresh trout baked whole is a delicacy,\" explained the cook. \"I don't give a fook,\" said Bob. \"I'm not eating fish with staring eyes.\" (This from a man who once won a cannabis joint after having been dared to eat a live beetle). It was inevitable that trouble at t'hot plate would increase with the proliferation of the prison population. Violent incidents spiralled, including assaults on kitchen staff, and even mini riots were not unusual in protest at being served \"anaemic chips\" or undercooked \"duff\" (a half brick of stodge covered in runny custard and alleged to be \"the sweet\"). Thankfully, collecting a meal from the hot plate today is a much less dramatic experience. For all that, I can guess what your thinking: what about the porridge? It's still available. When I went to collect my breakfast this morning, there was a choice of Cornflakes, Branflakes, Weetabix - or porridge, along with hot, buttered toast and fresh boiling water to make a refreshing cup of tea . For lunch I'll be having baked fish. I've no idea what kind, but delicious - with diced carrots and petit pois. And for tea, I'll be having a stir fry, followed by peaches and jelly. Not too fancy, but really quite pleasant all the same. So if anyone is considering a stretch soon, I hope these words have provided a morsel of reassurance concerning at least one aspect of what may be in store. By the way, may I recommend the healthy option? And bon appetit.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This is a toxic nightmare. You live cheek-by-jowl with one of the world's largest chemical complexes. You respect the people working there. You trust the company when it says it is cleaning up its act. You live in a tight, friendly community. You raise your children in the shadow of the stainless steel chimneys and tanks, the pylons and gantries, the waste ground, the lagoons and walkways that stretch three miles along the grey Mersey estuary.</p> <p>And then there's a knock at the door. A man from ICI Runcorn says traces of a gas called HCBD have been detected in some of the boreholes they have drilled on the edge of two old quarries behind your house. The quarries, as you know, were once company waste dumps, but they were capped decades ago and are now a pleasant place where horses graze.</p> <p>The man says there's nothing to worry about, but would you like your house monitored for the gas, just to be safe? Of course you agree. It all seems routine, like the company's \"dear neighbour\" letters that are dropped round every few months warning you what to do if you hear the sirens wail. But the sirens don't sound these days and you're not bothered.</p> <p>So they put the monitors in to check for this HCBD, and three days later they call by and tell you that, bad news, your house has tested positive and the local health authority is advising you to move out immediately. They are reassuring, but in the next breath they say that they will buy your house if you like. And not just yours, but all those in the street and most of the several hundred others in the village.</p> <p>And then you discover that HCBD is a really evil toxic gas that leaves a build-up of poison in your kidneys, and that one in five of all the houses they have tested is showing positive.</p> <p>So you start thinking. What else is in those waste tips? Why are there so many serious illnesses in the village? What are they not telling you? What about all those other pollution incidents? Is there another agenda? Why must we go so quickly if we have been living here so long? Why does Friends of the Earth call ICI Runcorn Britain's second most polluting factory? What is the real toxic legacy of Britain's oldest chemical complex? And the stories of what went on in the old days all start coming out...</p> <p>The village of Weston, population around 1,000, with its good housing, good schools, good church and people, is deep in this nightmare. Ever since ICI knocked on 120 doors along Weston Road in the first week of January, the stress levels have been rising. So far, 19 out of 104 properties in the street tested near the two linked waste tips have proved positive for HCBD, and more than 50 people have been evacuated to local hotels.</p> <p>Many more people are expecting to leave when they have been tested, and everyone is considering whether or not to move permanently. The special health phone line has been jammed. The scout hut has been condemned. All the neighbouring communities as far away as Runcorn are fearful about the possible effect on property prices, and the village, which is mentioned in the Domesday book, faces disintegration.</p> <p>With ICI not able to answer all the questions, with so many conflicting reports and little in writing, the rumours are flying - massive public meetings are being held every week and lawyers are touting for business. What will happen to the council tenants, the old and the ill? Can people sue? The questions from every quarter to the company, the local council, and the health authority are deafening.</p> <p>\"Some people are panicking,\" says David Farrimond, who owns the old British Legion club and a bungalow on Weston Road. It hasn't been tested yet, but the sale of his two-acre property has already fallen through and he's worried about his health.</p> <p>\"How can they find somewhere equivalent for me? What about my dogs? They can't go to a hotel. There's real fear, confusion and uncertainty. People are calling this place the 'village of the damned'. Friends and neighbours are phoning in, which just adds to the stress. We don't know what is happening.\"</p> <p>\"It's a really difficult time,\" says Brian Johnstone, a young civil servant whose house, also on Weston Road, was declared fit last week, but who reluctantly thinks he will have to sell because of his two young children. He is on the hastily set-up village action committee and is in regular talks with ICI. The worries, he says, are turning to anger, and the trust is going. The mood, he and others say, is that no one wants to go but few people will want to stay if the village is deserted.</p> <p>\"We're ordinary people, with families and jobs. None of us has ever faced a situation like this before. Everyone's livelihood is at stake,\" he says. Like most people, he doesn't blame ICI for trying to be responsible, only for the way they seem to be handling the crisis. \"The company is only doing its moral duty, but facts are few and far between,\" he says.</p> <p>ICI has never been in this situation before, either. The irony is that it was genuinely trying to be responsible and, as part of a corporate policy, to clear up the mess that it thought earlier chemical industry generations had made. Since 1993 it has been investigating the tip and the complex surrounding geology and poring over its old records to see if there is anything down there that could be affecting today's environment for people.</p> <p>Having checked the aquifers - where they found no problems - they dug the boreholes. \"It was a shock to find the HCBD in the quantities we did. We did not expect to find it at all,\" says a spokesman. He knows that if the company hadn't looked, no one would have been the wiser.</p> <p>But ICI is not saying precisely what quantities of the gas it has found, except that it varies from house to house, with the majority of positive readings in the range of 2.0 to 2.8 parts per billion. However, it admits there were two houses where the readings were almost three times this level. The acceptable occupational exposure rate is 20 parts per billion for an eight-hour day, but in many cases people have lived in these houses for years.</p> <p>ICI will have to continue monitoring the village, because it believes the release of gas could also depend on the season and atmospheric pressure. Moreover, the company has no idea how much gas is there, where it is going, how long it will continue to leach out, how far it could spread or how dangerous it is. More than a dozen ICI staff and members of the British Geological Survey, the Building Research Establishment and others scientists in the US and Britain are trying to predict, analyse and verify the results so far, but vapour transport is complex. \"But we strongly believe this is a localised problem\", says a spokesman, before adding that nothing surprises him any more.</p> <p>Nor is ICI saying what else is in the tip, or what precisely they were looking for when they dug the boreholes. It leaves the suspicion, say many in the village, that there is far worse down there, and this is why they are offering to buy up the houses immediately.</p> <p>Not true, says the company, which knows it would also have been damned had it not made the offer to buy everyone out immediately. \"Every way we turn, there is an upside and a downside. But there is no concern that we are hiding. The nightmare is what is happening now - disrupting the community. We deeply regret this,\" says a spokesman.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the mea culpas are falling on deaf ears and there is little local sympathy for the company; it may have to pay many millions to sort this out, but ICI and the chemical industry in general went unchecked and unregulated for years.</p> <p>The Weston pits are stockpiles of 50 or more years of chemical production. ICI's records show there have been up to 10,000 chemical processes on the site in that time, and the old-timers in the village say that just about every imaginable nasty has been dumped there.</p> <p>Some, such as Bruce Nicholson, remember playing with the mercury that appeared on the surface of the waste tips. \"There are whole train carriages, whole laboratory cell rooms - like vast batteries of mercury there,\" says Derek Smith, who worked for ICI for years. He and others remember ICI dumping toxic waste, quite legally, in lagoons, on marshland, in the river and in just about every hole in the vicinity.</p> <p>The bulk of the several million tons of waste in the two quarries is rubble, lime, chlorinated solvents, chemical catalysts and general industrial waste. But also known to be dumped were large amounts of highly toxic mercury, sodium, perchlorethylene, trichlorethylene, carbide and lime slurry, and thousands of unmarked steel drums whose contents are unknown. The site made chlorine gas during the second world war, then helped make atomic bombs. More recently, it was one of the world's largest producers of CFCs - the propellants and coolants that destroy the ozone layer. It is now one of Britain's greatest producers of deadly cancer-causing dioxins and is hounded by Friends of the Earth for its pollution record.</p> <p>The full name of the chemical now leaching into the sandstone rock outside the quarry is hexachloro-1,3-butadiene, HCBD for short. It is not found naturally in the environment, but is created in industrial chemical processes and used mainly in the manufacture of rubber compounds and, in liquid form, as a solvent and lubricant.</p> <p>HCBD is toxic and known effects include shortened lifespan, reproductive problems, lowered fertility and changes in appearance and behaviour. If ingested, it concentrates in the kidney.</p> <p>The solutions to Weston's nightmare are far from obvious. Remedial work could, theoretically, be done. It may be possible, says ICI, to dig up the foundations of every house in the neighbourhood and put a membrane in, or they could try to reline the waste tips. No decisions are being made yet but the likelihood is that just as ICI built houses for so many of its workers 100 years ago, so it will have to destroy much of Weston.</p> <p>This is a problem that councils, companies and individuals are going to have to face increasingly often. Britain's toxic legacy is huge and nasty, and there are hundreds of communities living on or near similar waste tips. In April, local authorities will be forced to assess all their toxic liabilities and, according to ICI, many other companies will be in the same position as they are in five years' time.</p> <p>\"ICI made this town,\" says Minnie, at 83 the second-oldest living inhabitant. She has lived in Weston for 60 years and has just been to one of the almost daily drop-in sessions that the company is holding in the church hall. She wants a gas monitor in her home, though it is not near the worst affected area. \"This used to be such a lovely little village,\" she says. \"There were five farms here. Then the war came and the motorway and now we've got this. You know, we didn't have the word environment then. It was so nice.\"</p>",

But social workers and analysts in Jakarta are warning that Mr Wahid's own failure to tackle major socio-economic issues is risking a social explosion greater than the one which toppled the dictator Suharto in May 1998. Speaking in South Korea, on the penultimate leg of a 16-day overseas tour, Mr Wahid said that Gen Wiranto's intransigence was stifling Indonesia's recovery after more than two years of economic turmoil. \"Because of him - his refusal to step down, to resign voluntarily - the country loses the opportunity to have investors, the chance to have an economic comeback,\" the president said. Gen Wiranto was first asked to resign 12 days ago after Indonesia's human rights commission implicated him in crimes against humanity in East Timor. But he insists he is innocent of any wrongdoing and has said he will not step down until he has discussed the matter with Mr Wahid, who is due home from a 16-day overseas tour on Sunday. The stand-off has sparked fears of a coup, which the armed forces commander, Admiral Widodo Adi Sutjipto, yesterday again stressed would never happen. The uncertainty has hit Jakarta's financial markets and increased foreign investors' reluctance to commit funds to Indonesia. \"Until the political situation is resolved, I'm telling people to stay away from Indonesia and maintain a wait-and-see attitude,\" one Singaporean investment consultant said. But he added that there was much more to Indonesia's \"political situation\" than the Wahid-Wiranto confrontation. \"Much of the government does not seem to be functioning properly.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If the British Council ever decided to sponsor a competition to find the Latin American who is most quintessentially English - in name, looks and spirit - then the wise money would be on the Venezuelan Charles Brewer-Carias. When I first met him, on a suffocatingly hot Caracas afternoon, he was wearing a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches, a monogrammed belt, circular-rimmed glasses and had a handlebar moustache in spiffing Terry-Thomas style.</p> <p>Brewer-Carias is an explorer, in the tradition of the great gentlemen explorers of the Empire. Perhaps more than any living Englishman, he fulfils the romantic stereotype of the swashbuckling jungle adventurer - bold, intrepid and impeccably proper. He politely cut short our first interview, giving possibly the most exotic excuse ever given to a journalist - he had to get back home because a taxonomist was waiting to name a frog after him.</p> <p>Grandson of the Victorian British vice-consul to La Guaira, the port serving Caracas, Brewer-Carias seems to have lived a life frozen in the era of Charles Darwin and David Livingstone. Now aged 61, he has made 148 expeditions into the Amazon jungle, lived with two Indian tribes, designed an army-standard jungle fighting knife (the Brewer survival knife) and discovered more than 20 types of plant, insect, bird and reptile that now bear his name. In March he will make his 149th, to the Autana Lake, an unexplored black water lake where according to local myths Loch Ness-style monsters lurk in the deep.</p> <p>For foreign explorers arriving in Caracas, Brewer-Carias is the first man to call. Redmond O'Hanlon, who describes him as a \"popular hero\", needed his services when planning In Trouble Again, his account of a daredevil trip up the Orinoco. Brewer-Carias sorted out the writer's jungle permits, against his better judgment. \"It is sheer luck that they came back alive,\" he says. \"They did things much more dangerous than I would have gone through. [O'Hanlon] was absolutely crazy.\"</p> <p>Brewer-Carias lives in a house overlooking Caracas that he built himself. A table of 23 machetes welcomes you as you come through the door. Display cases of beetles and butterflies adorn the walls. A pet snake sleeps on a table. Four tarantulas stand menacingly still in separate glass boxes.</p> <p>\"It took me a while to get used to the tarantulas,\" says his wife, Fanny, aged 34. \"But they are very easy to look after. You only need to feed them one mouse a month.\"</p> <p>In the 70s, Brewer-Carias made several excursions to La Gran Sabana, a mountainous area in the south of Venezuela that was first reached - but never scaled - by Sir Walter Raleigh in the 16th century and became immortalised in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic The Lost World. Brewer-Carias discovered huge sinkholes in the jungle - holes 350m deep and of a similar diameter - which he abseiled down and lived in for five days.</p> <p>He made his name internationally by leading the largest natural history expedition ever carried out, to the Cerro de la Neblina (the Misty Mountain) in the southwest of Venezuela, which lasted from 1983 to 1987 and involved 127 scientists from several institutions, including Kew Gardens.</p> <p>For our second meeting, he chose the Caracas Country Club - a pocket of colonial opulence in an otherwise slum-covered city. Around us, rich Venezuelans were playing golf as he regaled me with his jungle tales. \"The trick of survival is to know everything around you,\" he said, pointing at a cultivated tree overlooking a well-tended green. \"That one is extremely poisonous. It will help you stun fish to kill them in the water.\" He then sipped his mineral water.</p> <p>Lunch arrived, which provoked conversation about Amazonian cuisine. \"The worst thing I've eaten was the boiled guts and shit of the tapir,\" he said. \"It looks like shit. It smells like shit. But you have to be objective. The tapir only eats leaves. You have to tell yourself that it's just vegetables.\"</p> <p>Despite approaching retirement age, Brewer-Carias shows no sign of slowing down. He is working on several projects, including setting up a biological station and compiling a detailed catalogue of the 250,000 pictures he has taken of the flora and fauna of the Venezuelan Amazon. A tough, spindly-looking man, he remains in enviable shape for his age. Especially since his medical history is a textbook of tropical diseases - including the non-healing ulcer leishmaniasis, and a sting by the \"24-hour ant\", a wasp-sized ant whose bite is the most-feared pain in the jungle. And of course malaria, several times. \"Malaria is so common I don't even count it as a sickness any more,\" he shrugged.</p> <p>When it comes to his physical performance, however, his Latin machismo eclipses his gentlemanly reserve. To every younger man that passed our table he would make a cheeky boast about how he could swim faster, run quicker or push heavier weights.</p> <p>He does 120 chin-ups every day and is current holder of Venezuela's over-40s freestyle swimming record - the same time he swum as 100m national champion in the 1950s. \"Put your fingers here,\" he challenged as he led them to the middle of his chest and flexed his pectorals, trapping my hand in his taut cleavage. \"See how strong I am?\"</p> <p>Brewer-Carias trained as a dentist and despite his vast extracurricular knowledge it remains his only professional scientific expertise. His first jungle trips were funded by the dental practice he ran in Caracas during the 1960s and 70s. When, in 1960, he spent a year living with the Yekuana Indians, he made the first studies of Amazonian Indians' teeth, which resulted in his first book. He has since published six more, and more than 10 articles for academic journals.</p> <p>\"Charles is not an academic, but he has tremendous first-hand knowledge of the Venezuelan Amazon,\" says Brian Boom, vice-president for botanical science at the New York Botanical Garden. \"He is self-taught through reading, talking and travelling with lots of academics in a variety of fields over the years, but mostly from his own explorations. He views himself as a modern-day Humboldt, and I would wager he knows his way around the southern part of Venezuela as well as anyone alive.\"</p> <p>Brewer-Carias has kept contact with the Yekuana - whose language he speaks fluently - and the Yanomami, the world's largest Stone Age tribe, since he first met them. He finds it disturbing, however, going back to the Indian villages he went to as a young man. \"I am struck by the Indians who were young in 1960 and now are very old. I feel perfect. It is a shocking experience.</p> <p>\"You are confronted with your own mortality. This drives a lot in my life. I am running away from mortality by having these fulfilling experiences.\"</p> <p>However, Brewer-Carias's work with Napoleon Chagnon, whose book on the Yanomami is now a standard anthropological text, has led both men to be banned from a large part of the Venezuelan Amazon. He says it is because they have campaigned against the work of missionaries, and upset the vested interests of landowners. The accusations by regional politicians are that Brewer-Carias has enslaved and sexually abused Indians as well as dealing in their plasma.</p> <p>The international academic community sides with the explorer. Roy McDiarmid, chief US government herpetologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, is convinced of Brewer-Carias's good intentions. He says: \"I have always found him very sincere. But I can understand why people would find him offensive. He can get things done when other people can't. Part is his political connections. Part is just him: he never accepts no for an answer. He does piss people off.\"</p> <p>Brian Boom adds: \"It is nonsense that he 'enslaved' indians. I have been with Charles in the Yanomami area, and I have only seen him behave in a completely considerate fashion with the Indians. Charles admires and respects indigenous people, and I cannot imagine for an instant that there is any truth to these allegations.</p> <p>\"I have known Charles for some 15 years, and there always seems to be someone at odds with him or what he is doing. I think it has a lot to do with jealousy: he is athletic; he is smart; he is comfortable financially; he has published successful books and spectacular photographs; he is a character with charisma and he tells it like it is. All of these traits combine to make him a target for others.\"</p> <p>Brewer-Carias has always been controversial. In 1979 he was made Minister for Youth Affairs.

      "bodyText": "If the British Council ever decided to sponsor a competition to find the Latin American who is most quintessentially English - in name, looks and spirit - then the wise money would be on the Venezuelan Charles Brewer-Carias. When I first met him, on a suffocatingly hot Caracas afternoon, he was wearing a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches, a monogrammed belt, circular-rimmed glasses and had a handlebar moustache in spiffing Terry-Thomas style. Brewer-Carias is an explorer, in the tradition of the great gentlemen explorers of the Empire. Perhaps more than any living Englishman, he fulfils the romantic stereotype of the swashbuckling jungle adventurer - bold, intrepid and impeccably proper. He politely cut short our first interview, giving possibly the most exotic excuse ever given to a journalist - he had to get back home because a taxonomist was waiting to name a frog after him. Grandson of the Victorian British vice-consul to La Guaira, the port serving Caracas, Brewer-Carias seems to have lived a life frozen in the era of Charles Darwin and David Livingstone. Now aged 61, he has made 148 expeditions into the Amazon jungle, lived with two Indian tribes, designed an army-standard jungle fighting knife (the Brewer survival knife) and discovered more than 20 types of plant, insect, bird and reptile that now bear his name. In March he will make his 149th, to the Autana Lake, an unexplored black water lake where according to local myths Loch Ness-style monsters lurk in the deep. For foreign explorers arriving in Caracas, Brewer-Carias is the first man to call. Redmond O'Hanlon, who describes him as a \"popular hero\", needed his services when planning In Trouble Again, his account of a daredevil trip up the Orinoco. Brewer-Carias sorted out the writer's jungle permits, against his better judgment. \"It is sheer luck that they came back alive,\" he says. \"They did things much more dangerous than I would have gone through. [O'Hanlon] was absolutely crazy.\" Brewer-Carias lives in a house overlooking Caracas that he built himself. A table of 23 machetes welcomes you as you come through the door. Display cases of beetles and butterflies adorn the walls. A pet snake sleeps on a table. Four tarantulas stand menacingly still in separate glass boxes. \"It took me a while to get used to the tarantulas,\" says his wife, Fanny, aged 34. \"But they are very easy to look after. You only need to feed them one mouse a month.\" In the 70s, Brewer-Carias made several excursions to La Gran Sabana, a mountainous area in the south of Venezuela that was first reached - but never scaled - by Sir Walter Raleigh in the 16th century and became immortalised in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic The Lost World. Brewer-Carias discovered huge sinkholes in the jungle - holes 350m deep and of a similar diameter - which he abseiled down and lived in for five days. He made his name internationally by leading the largest natural history expedition ever carried out, to the Cerro de la Neblina (the Misty Mountain) in the southwest of Venezuela, which lasted from 1983 to 1987 and involved 127 scientists from several institutions, including Kew Gardens. For our second meeting, he chose the Caracas Country Club - a pocket of colonial opulence in an otherwise slum-covered city. Around us, rich Venezuelans were playing golf as he regaled me with his jungle tales. \"The trick of survival is to know everything around you,\" he said, pointing at a cultivated tree overlooking a well-tended green. \"That one is extremely poisonous. It will help you stun fish to kill them in the water.\" He then sipped his mineral water. Lunch arrived, which provoked conversation about Amazonian cuisine. \"The worst thing I've eaten was the boiled guts and shit of the tapir,\" he said. \"It looks like shit. It smells like shit. But you have to be objective. The tapir only eats leaves. You have to tell yourself that it's just vegetables.\" Despite approaching retirement age, Brewer-Carias shows no sign of slowing down. He is working on several projects, including setting up a biological station and compiling a detailed catalogue of the 250,000 pictures he has taken of the flora and fauna of the Venezuelan Amazon. A tough, spindly-looking man, he remains in enviable shape for his age. Especially since his medical history is a textbook of tropical diseases - including the non-healing ulcer leishmaniasis, and a sting by the \"24-hour ant\", a wasp-sized ant whose bite is the most-feared pain in the jungle. And of course malaria, several times. \"Malaria is so common I don't even count it as a sickness any more,\" he shrugged. When it comes to his physical performance, however, his Latin machismo eclipses his gentlemanly reserve. To every younger man that passed our table he would make a cheeky boast about how he could swim faster, run quicker or push heavier weights. He does 120 chin-ups every day and is current holder of Venezuela's over-40s freestyle swimming record - the same time he swum as 100m national champion in the 1950s. \"Put your fingers here,\" he challenged as he led them to the middle of his chest and flexed his pectorals, trapping my hand in his taut cleavage. \"See how strong I am?\" Brewer-Carias trained as a dentist and despite his vast extracurricular knowledge it remains his only professional scientific expertise. His first jungle trips were funded by the dental practice he ran in Caracas during the 1960s and 70s. When, in 1960, he spent a year living with the Yekuana Indians, he made the first studies of Amazonian Indians' teeth, which resulted in his first book. He has since published six more, and more than 10 articles for academic journals. \"Charles is not an academic, but he has tremendous first-hand knowledge of the Venezuelan Amazon,\" says Brian Boom, vice-president for botanical science at the New York Botanical Garden. \"He is self-taught through reading, talking and travelling with lots of academics in a variety of fields over the years, but mostly from his own explorations. He views himself as a modern-day Humboldt, and I would wager he knows his way around the southern part of Venezuela as well as anyone alive.\" Brewer-Carias has kept contact with the Yekuana - whose language he speaks fluently - and the Yanomami, the world's largest Stone Age tribe, since he first met them. He finds it disturbing, however, going back to the Indian villages he went to as a young man. \"I am struck by the Indians who were young in 1960 and now are very old. I feel perfect. It is a shocking experience. \"You are confronted with your own mortality. This drives a lot in my life. I am running away from mortality by having these fulfilling experiences.\" However, Brewer-Carias's work with Napoleon Chagnon, whose book on the Yanomami is now a standard anthropological text, has led both men to be banned from a large part of the Venezuelan Amazon. He says it is because they have campaigned against the work of missionaries, and upset the vested interests of landowners. The accusations by regional politicians are that Brewer-Carias has enslaved and sexually abused Indians as well as dealing in their plasma. The international academic community sides with the explorer. Roy McDiarmid, chief US government herpetologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, is convinced of Brewer-Carias's good intentions. He says: \"I have always found him very sincere. But I can understand why people would find him offensive. He can get things done when other people can't. Part is his political connections. Part is just him: he never accepts no for an answer. He does piss people off.\" Brian Boom adds: \"It is nonsense that he 'enslaved' indians. I have been with Charles in the Yanomami area, and I have only seen him behave in a completely considerate fashion with the Indians. Charles admires and respects indigenous people, and I cannot imagine for an instant that there is any truth to these allegations. \"I have known Charles for some 15 years, and there always seems to be someone at odds with him or what he is doing. I think it has a lot to do with jealousy: he is athletic; he is smart; he is comfortable financially; he has published successful books and spectacular photographs; he is a character with charisma and he tells it like it is. All of these traits combine to make him a target for others.\" Brewer-Carias has always been controversial. In 1979 he was made Minister for Youth Affairs. He is remembered for the \"frontier camps\" he set up - \"a cross between a kibbutz and the Foreign Legion\", he says - which enabled 250,000 boys to visit Venezuela's remote borders. On one occasion he took a group of 40 boys and invaded territory disputed with Guyana, creating an international diplomatic incident, and in the process earning himself a military award. He has also infuriated environmentalists by buying a gold mine from the government, which critics believe goes against his environmental credentials. Brewer-Carias ripostes that you have to be realistic. \"A single 20-mile road does more damage than all the mines that have been dug in Venezuela in the last 100 years,\" he says. \"Charles is not a specialist in birds, or botany or geology,\" says Juan Carlos Ramirez, an Amazonian tour operator. \"But he knows a lot about a lot of things and he is able to put these things together. He is absolutely the greatest explorer in Venezuela alive today.\" Roy McDiarmid believes his expertise has furthered understanding of the jungle: \"He has learnt a lot from his connections with the native people and with scientists.

It is often the case anyway, especially with a large group of friends, that one person must instigate a meeting. What I did when I was in this situation was carry on as normal. I tried to avoid my ex as much as possible, and see the group of friends at the same time, mostly by swallowing my pride and being the \"instigator\" - organising drinks out, etc (something my ex wasn't good at). It's not very creative, but it does work.</p> <p>The most important thing is to be honest. Tell the friends (start with the ones you are closest to) how you feel. If they are true friends, they will understand. They may all be feeling that they have to make a choice between you and your ex, so if you can avoid making them decide, so much the better.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In a recent film by French Romany director Tony Gatlif, the hero, bored with handing out political pamphlets on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, starts hailing passers-by with a mocking cry of \"New York Herald Trib-u-u-ne!\" The fond reference is to a turning point of modern cinema - Jean-Luc Godard's 1959 debut feature A Bout de Souffle (Breathless), in which crop-haired Jean Seberg brought an ambivalent blast of US culture to the boulevards. The rest of Gatlif's film is equally Godard-fixated - in one scene, a film critic rubber-stamps a programme of the director's work with the single word \"God\". </p> <p>Such homages show that Godard's influence in France is still inescapable. As one of the key figures - many would say, the key figure - of the nouvelle vague, Godard was the cultural polymath who practically invented French screen modernism, using a vast repertoire of cinematic, literary, artistic and historical references to forge an ideal of a demanding, militant, hyper-serious yet hyper-playful cinema. On French TV, comedians still get a laugh imitating his rasping, doom-laden voice-overs; young populist auteurs still routinely disparage him as the pope of \"nombriliste\" (navel-gazing) art cinema. </p> <p>Yet Godard has long been a phantom presence. Once at the centre of world film culture, he has been through several forms of quasi-exile since the mid-60s. First he abandoned the commercial cinema world for revolutionary avant-gardism with the Dziga Vertov group, founded with Jean-Pierre Gorin, in the late 60s and early 70s. Then he returned to Switzerland, where he grew up, retreating to Rolle on Lake Geneva with his personal and professional partner, film-maker Anne-Marie Mi\u00e9ville. After a brief semi-commercial comeback in the 80s, he has now retreated to the margins, pushing the structural complexities of his work so far that even an averagely committed art-cinema audience declines to follow him. </p> <p>Godard may no longer fill cinemas, but for many admirers he's more godlike than ever. Some recent work for film and TV may demand a leap of faith - for example, is H\u00e9las Pour Moi, made in 1993, radical experimentation or just plain incoherent? But for the most part, Godard's enigmas continue to fascinate: his films, more essayistic, less narrative than ever before, have become a continuous free-form commentary on art, society, memory and, above all, cinema. Much of it is autumnal, melancholic, and at the very least, suggestive of profundity. If his series Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma - (Hi)stories of Cinema - is, as some feel, cinema's answer to Finnegans Wake, then the 1995 \"autoportrait\" JLG/JLG is surely its Krapp's Last Videotape. </p> <p>British audiences may not know it - he hasn't had a film released here since the mid-80s - but Godard at 70 is still going strong. But there's always some mystery surrounding his current activity. That's why I'm surprised to get the call to interview him in his producer's office in Paris: the deal is that he'll talk only for half an hour, and specifically about his new film, Eloge de l'Amour (In Praise of Love), which will premiere in Venice this autumn. That makes Godardian sense - an interview about a film that no one's seen, and that, most likely, will only vaguely resemble the sketchy script-cum-treatment that I get to read. What the hell. It has to be worth the trip. </p> <p>The audience turns out to be with a man exactly like the \"Jean-Luc Godard\" character he often plays in his and Mi\u00e9ville's films - mad Uncle Jean in Pr\u00e9nom: Carmen, or the slogan-muttering narrator of Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma. Godard is as much a self-created cartoon as Woody Allen: unshaven jaw, unkempt brush of wiry hair, TV-screen glasses, and the huge cigar, his perennial tribute to the old Hollywood mandarins. He's friendly, but to the point: a handshake, a cough, and we begin. I ask whether his new film will resemble its script much: he once claimed film scripts were invented by Mafia accountants to keep the books regular. \"That's just a historical hypothesis,\" he says, the baleful gravelly voice emerging from way back in his throat. </p> <p>\"There comes a time when things have to be made regular - you can see it in films today. Accountancy has a huge influence. It's the same in war - one soldier, 10 accountants behind him.\" In Praise of Love will be in two parts, half 35mm, half digital video. Half of it involves a man working on a vague project (a film? an opera? who knows) called In Praise of Love; half is about two Resistance veterans whose story Steven Spielberg wants to make into a movie. Juliette Binoche will appear, but only as a voice on the phone: \"But just for two minutes. Not even that - 30 seconds. All I want is for us to hear her voice, rather than pretend that it's Julia Roberts or whoever.\" </p> <p>Whatever the film becomes between now and Venice, it won't be exactly what Godard first envisioned. \"I wanted to do a picture of love, between young people, between adults, and between the old, but with the adults it didn't really work. You can film a first kiss between the young, or even the old, but adults - not really. I just kept that as a framework, so it's the story of someone who has that project in mind but can't carry it out.\" </p> <p>The dominant subject may turn out to be Godard's long-running animus against Spielberg, whose crime in this film is to turn a real-life drama into \"une histoire de Hollywood.\" Godard has complained that Schindler's List was \"du Max Factor\" and once challenged Spielberg to a showdown debate at the Locarno film festival. (He declined). In Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma, he coins the portentous formula, \"Power of Hollywood. Power of Babylon.\" Does he see Spielberg as being on the side of Babylon? \"I don't know about Babylon. But at any rate it's a rather tyrannical power.\" </p> <p>Godard has long entertained an ambivalent relationship with American cinema. As a critic on Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in the 50s, along with auteurs-to-be Truffaut, Chabrol, Rohmer and Rivette, he helped reinvent Hollywood history as an alternative Great Tradition - although he confesses, \"We defended a lot of film-makers, even some who weren't really that wonderful.\" On the business front, there was a flirtation with Hollywood in the late 70s, when he was briefly affiliated with Francis Coppola's Zoetrope company. And in the 90s, no one would have been terribly surprised if Quentin Tarantino, who raved about Godard to anyone who'd listen, had wangled him a deal with Miramax. Godard shrugs. </p> <p>\"Tarantino named his production company after one of my films. He'd have done better to give me some money.\" He displays a peppery attitude to his young acolytes. Hal Hartley recently offered him a part playing \"a monster.\" Will he accept? \"It depends how much he's paying, and if it doesn't take up too much time. I probably won't. Unless he pays me a fortune. And he's not rich, so he probably won't.\" He gives a sly cackle and puffs on his cigar. </p> <p>Godard's recent work may have a hardcore audience among a coterie of critics and academics, especially in the US. But in France, his audience is nothing like it once was, and he's reconciled to his marginal status. \"In France there are perhaps 100,000 or 200,000 people more or less like me, who might go and see my films. They're fewer than they used to be, because it's too difficult, because the world has changed. They go to the cinema a lot less, and so do I. But if they do go, they'll give 80% of themselves to the film. If you go and see Titanic, you only give the film 10% of your personality. Good films get smaller audiences, but more of the viewer.\" </p> <p>Who, then, are Godard's faithful few? \"They're probably people of my age, who are a bit nostalgic, who feel the world's going wrong. Younger people may sense there's a struggle going on, maybe it's not really their film, but they see the struggle and they respect it. They're glad to see it. It's like going to the museum. People will queue three hours in the rain to see an exhibition, for the sense of images, of a look - they know that's something you can't see every day, and they need that. They know that's where the treasure is. You can go and see Titanic - but from time to time, you go and see the treasure.\" </p> <p>For 40 years, the word \"Godardian\" has been in common currency to describe a way of seeing cinema and the world. Was there ever a moment when Godard became aware of his own name taking on the same ring that \"Alfred Hitchcock\" or \"Fritz Lang\" had for him? </p> <p>\"Yes, it felt strange, and it was awkward for me in my private life. But it started to change in 1968 - I began to realise it was a label. I'm glad to have made lots of more or less successful films - but especially ones which weren't successful, because that helps you to see yourself more or less normally.\" He never considered himself in the same terms as the auteurs he once wrote about. \"John Cassavetes, who was more or less my age - now he was a great director. I can't imagine myself as his equal in cinema. For me he represents a certain cinema that's way up above.\" </p> <p>Although he has been vocal in his praise of such film-makers as Abbas Kiarostami, Godard admits he's much less of a cinephile these days. \"I hate watching films on TV. I have to see them on a big screen, but if a film disappears, then it disappears. Sometimes if you're really missing a film badly, then OK - the only way to watch a film in prison is on video. TV is a mechanism of transmission, not of creation - but if you need something, then it comes to you like a ray of sunshine through a prison window. From time to time, I'll dig out a tape and watch it the way I'd listen to a record.\" </p> <p>Godard may sound like a peevish Luddite, yet he was pioneering the use of video in the mid-70s. The Histoire(s) series is a technological tour de force, mixing sound, text and image into a kind of utopian Gesamtkunstwerk. You'd imagine he'd take naturally to new multimedia, like his contemporary and kindred spirit Chris Marker, but he's a sceptic. </p> <p>\"CD-Rom isn't that interesting. There's that Borges labyrinth side to it, but all that's over and done with. The technicians have taken it all - they create, but they don't have that much talent.\" He shrugs, and launches into a codger's lament on the condition of the techno-world. \"I used to iron my shirts - I can't do it any more, because the iron's got too many buttons on it. I live in a little village and the laundry has closed down. We're going back to the Middle Ages in a different way - everything takes a long time, even if it happens quickly. If you write to me in Switzerland, and you're in a hurry, don't do it by courier, it takes too long - use the normal post. In France, Switzerland and Germany, the postal service still works.\" </p> <p>Time's up. Godard gives a brisk, courteous \"OK\" and shakes my hand. He puts on his overcoat and scarf, hangs a rolled-up umbrella on his arm and leaves, cigar in mouth. I watch him shuffle off down the road, looking exactly like the testy philosopher uncle of his films. We're only a minute's walk from the spot on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es where Jean Seberg once peddled her papers, but that's in the other direction, not to mention 40 years ago, and in another history of cinema entirely.</p> <p>\u0095 The soundtrack of Histoire(s) du Cin\u008ema is available as a CD box set on ECM Records. The National Film Theatre is planning an extensive Godard retrospective in 2001.</p> <p><strong>Godard: a life in movies</strong></p> <p><strong>Early Godard</strong></p> <p>A fiery, polemical critic on the film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, Godard made several shorts in the 50s. His first feature A Bout de Souffle (Breathless) in 1959 established Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg as the iconic bohemian screen couple. His early 60s work was a fevered deconstruction of film styles and genres - musical (Une Femme Est Une Femme), sci-fi (Alphaville), war film (Les Carabiniers), and film-about-film (Le M\u00e9pris). </p> <p><strong>Political period</strong></p> <p>Godard's first overtly political film was Le Petit Soldat (1960), banned in France for its commentary on Algeria. His 60s films became increasingly concerned with politics and sociology, culminating in the Maoist student cell of La Chinoise (1967), which anticipated events of the following year. In reaction to May '68, Godard founded the Dziga Vertov group with Jean-Pierre Gorin: the mission was not just to make political films, but to \"film politically\". He continued in this direction with his 70s video work with Anne-Marie Mi\u00e9ville. </p> <p><strong>The comeback</strong></p> <p> Sauve Qui Peut (La Vie) (1979) was Godard's return to the big screen, the first of a series of complex, playful films that reinvented the tradition of the de luxe art movie: Passion, Pr\u00e9nom: Carmen, D\u00e9tective, and Hail Mary, which sparked a wave of Catholic outrage. But by 1987's King Lear, Godard had effectively alienated his new mainstream audience. </p> <p><strong>The 90s</strong></p> <p>Godard's major project in the 90s was the eight-part Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma, but there were also several cinema features hardly or never seen in Britain: the elegantly enigmatic Nouvelle Vague (1990); the entirely mystifying H\u00e9las Pour Moi (1993); and For Ever Mozart (1996), his controversial take on Bosnia. </p> <p><strong>Godard et les stars</strong></p> <p> Radical he may be, but Godard has always had box-office appeal. He played Svengali to his own iconic star, his first wife Anna Karina, from Le Petit Soldat through to Pierrot le Fou (1965) and Made in USA (1966). He also uses stars with an ironic eye for their public image: Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance (Le M\u00e9pris), Alain Delon, rocker Johnny Hallyday, even the Rolling Stones in his 1968 One Plus One. Jane Fonda starred in his Marxist melodrama Tout va Bien, but he repaid her by deconstructing her militant chic in Letter to Jane. Norman Mailer, Molly Ringwald and Woody Allen were inveigled into his King Lear.</p>",

His early 60s work was a fevered deconstruction of film styles and genres - musical (Une Femme Est Une Femme), sci-fi (Alphaville), war film (Les Carabiniers), and film-about-film (Le M\u00e9pris). Political period Godard's first overtly political film was Le Petit Soldat (1960), banned in France for its commentary on Algeria. His 60s films became increasingly concerned with politics and sociology, culminating in the Maoist student cell of La Chinoise (1967), which anticipated events of the following year. In reaction to May '68, Godard founded the Dziga Vertov group with Jean-Pierre Gorin: the mission was not just to make political films, but to \"film politically\". He continued in this direction with his 70s video work with Anne-Marie Mi\u00e9ville. The comeback Sauve Qui Peut (La Vie) (1979) was Godard's return to the big screen, the first of a series of complex, playful films that reinvented the tradition of the de luxe art movie: Passion, Pr\u00e9nom: Carmen, D\u00e9tective, and Hail Mary, which sparked a wave of Catholic outrage. But by 1987's King Lear, Godard had effectively alienated his new mainstream audience. The 90s Godard's major project in the 90s was the eight-part Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma, but there were also several cinema features hardly or never seen in Britain: the elegantly enigmatic Nouvelle Vague (1990); the entirely mystifying H\u00e9las Pour Moi (1993); and For Ever Mozart (1996), his controversial take on Bosnia. Godard et les stars Radical he may be, but Godard has always had box-office appeal. He played Svengali to his own iconic star, his first wife Anna Karina, from Le Petit Soldat through to Pierrot le Fou (1965) and Made in USA (1966). He also uses stars with an ironic eye for their public image: Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance (Le M\u00e9pris), Alain Delon, rocker Johnny Hallyday, even the Rolling Stones in his 1968 One Plus One. Jane Fonda starred in his Marxist melodrama Tout va Bien, but he repaid her by deconstructing her militant chic in Letter to Jane. Norman Mailer, Molly Ringwald and Woody Allen were inveigled into his King Lear.",

      "body": "<p>Early on in Kathryn Bigelow's surfers-and-bankrobbers thriller Point Break, rookie wave-rider Keanu Reeves breaches a cardinal tenet of surf-rat etiquette by stepping into another man's wave. Bad idea. They collide and both wipe out horribly. As Reeves emerges dazed and breathless from the foam, the offended surfer swims toward him and punches him hard in the face. As he swims out again, he looks over his shoulder and delivers a deathless insult that indicts Reeves's perceived amateurishness, his essential hickhood, and his thousand-percent lameness: \"Get back to the Valley, man! \" </p> <p>To hear people tell it, the San Fernando Valley has never been cool, never even come close. In southern California terms, it's long been a patronising synonym for everything that's the polar opposite of cool. It is to LA, its parent conurbation, what north New Jersey and Long Island are to Manhattan: far from the main action, way back in the boonies, the place where the maids and the pool cleaners live because they can't afford those steep uptown rents, and all-round shorthand for dweeb, geek, butthead and dipshit.</p> <p>When John Travolta and Samuel Jackson find themselves with a friend's brains all over their car's upholstery in Pulp Fiction, they're stuck in the Valley. \"Man, I ain't got no motherfuckin' contacts in 818!\" howls Jackson, citing the Valley's area-code. If he didn't need help right now, if he was back in a bar in Inglewood with his boys, those words would be uttered with unconcealed pride. </p> <p>But just as The Sopranos has recently lent an unexpected cultural cachet to the characterless, mall-blighted landscape of north Jersey, so too is the Valley acquiring its share of intoxicated residents, like Magnolia director Paul Thomas Anderson, eager to proselytise on its behalf, to hymn its lily-white weirdness, and mine its rich seams of inch-deep history and suburban surrealism. </p> <p>The San Fernando Valley is actually, in legal terms, a part of the city of Los Angeles; but it's a distinctly separate place, cut off both mentally and geographically from the fleshpots of Hollywood, the corporate eyries of downtown LA, and the Speedo-clad, Coppertone-marinated democracy of the city's 40-mile ribbon of golden beaches. The catalogue of differences extends to the Valley's beleaguered suburban homesteader mindset, its near-Iowan racial homogeneity, and even its climate. The Santa Monica mountains which form the Valley's southern boundary help shield it from the coastal breezes that cool Los Angeles proper, and in summer it's never less than 10 degrees hotter, and exponentially more humid. </p> <p>The Valley - LA's neglected stepchild - has something of a municipal inferiority complex. LA politicians hold its purse strings, and Valley powerbrokers have long complained about getting short shrift when it comes to the disbursement of funds. For a few years now there has been a small but growing movement to secede from Los Angeles and establish a separate city. If that happened the resulting metropolis would be the nation's seventh largest, and by some considerable measure its whitest. And in the eyes of its detractors, the most boring. </p> <p>Those are the cliches. Closer examination reveals that in many ways, the history of southern California is better encapsulated by the Valley than by LA itself. From orange grove to urban nightmare, it is truly a place shaped by the 20th century, its destiny inextricably intertwined with the great technological advances of the last 100 years: aviation, the automobile, the movies and TV (and their bastard offspring, the porn industry), space flight, defence manufacturing and massive residential housing developments. And without the massive engineering project that brought water to LA from the Owens River Valley in the mid-teens, and the invention of the affordable air-conditioning unit after the second world war, the Valley (and much of the American southwest) as we know it might never have come into being. </p> <p>As anyone who's seen Chinatown knows, the powerbrokers of LA essentially stole the Owens Valley water supply. Today the once fertile area is a dustbowl. William Mulholland, head of LA's Department of Water and Power (Chinatown's original title was Water and Power), in concert with an informal consortium of super-wealthy Angelenos, including Los Angeles Times owner Otis Chandler, agitated for a municipal bond issue to finance the 200 miles of aqueducts and pipelines needed to bring the water to the city.</p> <p>Earlier, they had secretly bought huge parcels of then arid Valley land at rock-bottom prices, knowing the killing they'd make when irrigation and agriculture became feasible. The San Fernando Valley's very existence is thus based on a massive act of environmental piracy, a gigantic landgrab and a kind of Wild West boomtown corruption. The taxpayers of LA thus paid dearly for the means to enrich even further its very wealthiest robber barons. </p> <p>On the other hand, no water, no city. For better or worse, it takes visionary, greedy bastards like these to build cities where before there were only sand and rattlesnakes. And from the 1920s until the beginning of the second world war, the Valley was something like a paradise. This mythical heaven could not last though. It was hustled out of existence by industrialisation and the outbreak of war.</p> <p>Industrial growth was hugely spurred by the need for ships and weapons with which to fight the Pacific campaign. The sudden influx of steel plants and armaments manufacturers (and the rise of the automobile) poisoned the air and led to agriculture's steep decline. Before and during the war, farmland and unincorporated tracts were bought up en masse by prescient developers and private investors (perhaps the most famous were Bing Crosy and Bob Hope) in preparation for the need to house millions of returning GIs. Demobbed in Long Beach or San Pedro, Okie soldiers who'd starved during the Depression took one look at the sunshine and the limitless possibilities and never went home. </p> <p>Financed by cheap loans available through the postwar GI Bill, the Valley started to fill up. The new cities didn't emerge organically, though. Huge amalgamations of erstwhile farmland were subdivided into streets and neighbourhoods by massive development and construction corporations. The period is well portrayed in the sequel to Chinatown, The Two Jakes, much of whose action takes place in a model home on such a development. Where its lawn ends, there the desert begins, and periodically the ground underfoot emits terrifying tremors. </p> <p>Even today, the Valley is, to quote California historian Peter Schrag, \"an amorphous collection of developer-spawned post-office addresses in the northwest corner of Los Angeles - Northridge (epicentre of the devastating 1994 quake), Pacoima, Chatsworth, Canoga Park, Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Encino (the Valley's Beverly Hills), Panorama City, Studio City, Woodland Hills - that really has no identity beyond its resentment of downtown.\" Forget LA, the Valley better suits Raymond Chandler's adage about \"70 suburbs in search of a city.\" </p> <p>Be that as it may, the 1950s are now fondly remembered as the second period in which the Valley was close to very heaven. Returning GIs and those Easterners who made the trek west after Eisenhower's 1955 Federal Highways Act linked up the country found more space than they could have imagined back in their cramped eastern and midwestern tenements and farms. With Depression and war fading from their memories, they built a life of swimming pools, backyard barbecues and two-car garages, becoming a new version of Thomas Jefferson's ideal American, the freeholding yeoman-farmer (or yeoman-worker bee) in a landscape of single-family dwellings. </p> <p>But as urban theorist Mike Davis has pointed out, this \"endless summer\" was a whites-only phenomenon: restrictive covenants were the order of the day. If you signed a property deed, it was likely to include the phrase \"No one whose blood is not entirely of the Caucasian race will be permitted to own property in this subdivision.\" Hence the number of primarily Jewish enclaves that inserted themselves in the cracks between such racially monitored new cities. Throughout the 1960s Klan membership in southern California was highest in the Valley.</p> <p>In the 1970s the Valley's only unifying political issues were its opposition to the busing of black children to white Valley schools, and the passage of Proposition 13, which aimed to cut disproportionate property taxes, but ended up starving California's schools and infrastructure. And more recently Rodney King was beaten up on the Valley's Foothill Boulevard as 17 policemen watched. Just up the freeway is the Spahn Movie Ranch near Chatsworth, whence Charles Manson - another avowed white supremacist - dispatched his robot-hippie murderers on their dreadful missions. </p> <p>The spectre of tackiness reared its ugly head again in the late 1970s, when it became apparent that the Valley was suddenly America's porn headquarters. Back then, in the period covered by Paul Thomas Anderson's epic Boogie Nights, \"the Industry\", as it is euphemised by its participants was made up of tiny owner-operated companies, some with a foot in gangland, filming on the lam and making a packet. </p> <p>The video revolution did to porn what the CD did to the music industry and since the mid-80s the small fry of years gone by have grown into immensely rich entrepreneurs with names like John \"Buttman\" Stagliano, Max Hardcore, John T Bone and Seymour Butts. The upshot - despite the occasional kerfuffle over backyard sex-shoots - is a semi-respectability that's prompted a surreptitious, previously inconceivable crabwalk into the fringes of the mainstream. </p> <p>Without equating the area solely with porn - though plenty of folks do - the Valley itself has also recently become cooler than once it was. America's late discovery of irony hasn't hurt - ie, liking something for the very reasons other people despise it - and neither have a slew of movies like California Man (in which a defrosted caveman is capable of becoming Prom King), and Todd Haynes's Safe, which proves that the spirit of Michelangelo Antonioni can be invoked in these unpromising surroundings. And the wildly underrated Two Days in the Valley makes eloquent use of a slew of Valley stereotypes and grotesques. </p> <p>If there is a single sight that sums up the Valley for me, it is a swimming pool I once visited in the town of Tarzana, which was originally an estate founded by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1911 and named for his most famous creation. It was the first pool ever built in the San Fernando Valley, and was a gift to Burroughs from Otis Chandler, made possible in part by his sudden enrichment after the water hijack in 1913. When I saw it a few years ago, it was just a trash-filled, tiled hole in the ground.</p> <p>For me it represents both the Valley's freebooting, obscenely wealthy origins, and its potential apocalyptic future conjoined in a single image. Five well-placed bombs on the Owens Valley pipeline and the whole region might soon seem this desolate, with the city that shouldn't be here slowly reclaimed by the desert, and jaguars once again roaming Magnolia Boulevard. A mile or so away Burroughs is buried under a tree outside his old house. Ten feet from his resting place, the traffic roars by on Ventura Boulevard. </p> <p>The Valley, like much of California, is a state of mind made up of equal parts false memory and outrageous optimism.

      "body": "<p>One of Hollywood's most prolific and underrated directors is dead. You won't find it him the obituaries, because no body has been found. The guys with the inside gen are sworn to secrecy. But one man is talking. Joe Eszterhas claims he put Alan Smithee \"under the ground\", though other evidence points to a mystery man called Thomas Lee. Smithee was a shadowy figure himself. But in a career spanning 30 years and 40 films, he earned the right to call himself a director's director. Some say he had no style of his own, others say you could smell a Smithee film a mile away. </p> <p>Supernova has all the hallmarks of an Alan Smithee film. A sci-fi saga, it cost $65m and opened in more than 2,000 US cinemas last month without any press previews. Many believe Supernova is Smithee's work, though the name on the credits is Thomas Lee. MGM refuses to talk about it and the US Directors Guild also refuses to comment, though it doesn't discount a Lee-Smithee connection. </p> <p>So did Lee murder Smithee and steal his film? He is part of a conspiracy of silence and lies that goes right to the heart of Hollywood. In the beginning, Supernova was by Walter Hill, the director of 48 Hours and Southern Comfort. But those familiar with Smithee will know his habit of taking over others' films. Smithee made his debut with Death of a Gunfighter in 1969. It began under director Robert Totten, but three-quarters of the way through the shoot its star, Richard Widmark, refused to go on working with him. </p> <p>Don Siegel, under contract to Universal, was ordered to finish the picture. He thought Totten's footage \"damn good\", and simply picked up where he left off. Totten did not want his name on it. Nor did Siegel, but the Guild insisted someone be credited. The name Smith was suggested, until it was pointed out that there were several directors called Smith. Someone suggested Smithe, which evolved into Smithee, with two Es. And so Alan Smithee, or Allen Smithee, was born. </p> <p>When Death of a Gunfighter was released, critics hailed Smithee as a bright new talent. \"I told all my young friends who wanted to become directors to change their name to Smithee and take credit,\" Siegel wrote in his autobiography. </p> <p>The DGA called on Smithee regularly over the years when production companies sacked directors or re-edited films.

      "bodyText": "One of Hollywood's most prolific and underrated directors is dead. You won't find it him the obituaries, because no body has been found. The guys with the inside gen are sworn to secrecy. But one man is talking. Joe Eszterhas claims he put Alan Smithee \"under the ground\", though other evidence points to a mystery man called Thomas Lee. Smithee was a shadowy figure himself. But in a career spanning 30 years and 40 films, he earned the right to call himself a director's director. Some say he had no style of his own, others say you could smell a Smithee film a mile away. Supernova has all the hallmarks of an Alan Smithee film. A sci-fi saga, it cost $65m and opened in more than 2,000 US cinemas last month without any press previews. Many believe Supernova is Smithee's work, though the name on the credits is Thomas Lee. MGM refuses to talk about it and the US Directors Guild also refuses to comment, though it doesn't discount a Lee-Smithee connection. So did Lee murder Smithee and steal his film? He is part of a conspiracy of silence and lies that goes right to the heart of Hollywood. In the beginning, Supernova was by Walter Hill, the director of 48 Hours and Southern Comfort. But those familiar with Smithee will know his habit of taking over others' films. Smithee made his debut with Death of a Gunfighter in 1969. It began under director Robert Totten, but three-quarters of the way through the shoot its star, Richard Widmark, refused to go on working with him. Don Siegel, under contract to Universal, was ordered to finish the picture. He thought Totten's footage \"damn good\", and simply picked up where he left off. Totten did not want his name on it. Nor did Siegel, but the Guild insisted someone be credited. The name Smith was suggested, until it was pointed out that there were several directors called Smith. Someone suggested Smithe, which evolved into Smithee, with two Es. And so Alan Smithee, or Allen Smithee, was born. When Death of a Gunfighter was released, critics hailed Smithee as a bright new talent. \"I told all my young friends who wanted to become directors to change their name to Smithee and take credit,\" Siegel wrote in his autobiography. The DGA called on Smithee regularly over the years when production companies sacked directors or re-edited films. There was dross like The Shrimp on the Barbie and a sequel to The Birds, but there was the occasional rough diamond too, such as Catchfire, a thriller with the stylistic weirdness of Dennis Hopper. Michael Mann got the credit for Heat, but Smithee directed a TV version; Martin Brest directed Scent of a Woman, but Smithee was responsible for the version shown on planes. Smithee was more than a pseudonym - he became the means for directors to let the industry know they were disowning a film, while observing a vow of silence at the insistence of studios, who had to sell the film to a gullible public and did not want the director bad-mouthing it. But then Smithee got ideas above his station. No longer content with his role as a director's director, he wanted a public profile too and teamed up with Joe Eszterhas, the writer who received a record $3m fee for Basic Instinct. Eszterhas promised him star billing on An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn, a comedy in which a man called Alan Smithee (Eric Idle) discovers the only way he can disown his film is by turning over his credit to Alan Smithee. It was relatively simple for director Arthur Hiller to do just that, after falling out with Eszterhas over the final shape of the film. It flopped at the US box office in 1998 and went straight to video in the UK, but it prompted widespread discussion in the media and on the internet. \"After Alan Smithee became known to the movie-going public, as opposed to just inside the industry, it became problematic,\" one insider told me earlier this week. \"It would somehow represent the film as damaged goods.\" Other pseudonyms have been used, though the DGA refuses to name names. \"That's the whole point - anonymity,\" says a source.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps it was an experience at boarding school that made Kim Longinotto a woman who would spend her life watching others. She was 13. There was a school trip. She became separated from the group and, in the confusion, the teachers of Hampden House, a private school in Buckinghamshire, were made to look fools. By the time she was found, they had raised her offence from accidental straying to wilful truancy and all future trips were banned. Longinotto was sent to Coventry for two years. \"Nobody talked to me. Not once. The teachers were angry because I got lost, and embarrassed the school. The students were angry because the trips got cancelled. I was completely isolated.\" </p> <p>In her television documentaries, Longinotto protects the isolated voice from obscurity by projecting it over the heads of its censors. Iranian women, conventionally portrayed in the west as weeping fundamentalists or mute victims of domestic violence, find their tongues in Divorce Iranian Style, the riveting film she made over five weeks in a Tehran divorce court. \"He has sexual problems,\" rages one furious wife in court. \"I found out on our wedding night but kept it quiet not to shame the family.\" \"He is mad,\" spits another. \"He has been from the beginning. God punish the liar.\" </p> <p>\"Women can't win against Iranian law,\" says Longinotto. \"But they can win against the judge who feels sympathetic towards them. You get a sense of their power, but it's not a legal power, it's their own power.\" It is a combination of rhetorical and theatrical power - the same elements that make up Longinotto's films and have won her awards at the Paris and San Francisco film festivals. </p> <p>She started her career, improbably enough, on the camera crew for the early 80s Madness biopic Take It or Leave It; and her first solo project proper was shot at Hampden House - \"revenge\" she called it. But it was The Good Wife of Tokyo, a film she made in 1992, about the mother of Frank Chickens singer Kazuko Hohki, that brought her to public attention. More acclaim followed in 1993, for Dream Girls, covering the fortunes of the Japanese pupils studying to be stars in the popular revue show Takarazuka; while its follow-up, Shinjuku Boys, examined the lives of three \"onnabes\"- women living lives as men. </p> <p>Longinotto doesn't like voiceovers. It is important the development of her characters emerges through their own dialogue. \"You have to be very patient. You have to give up your own life and totally wait for their life to take you in. There are times when I'll say, we are just going to sit here for a bit and the sound recordist will say, what for? It's a frame of mind. To get to those moments where things are revealed, you have to be quite lazy.\" </p> <p>Longinotto speaks softly and a little nervously, which has the effect of accentuating her thinness. The lower her voice gets, the more you notice her posture, too, sloping a little to the floor, perhaps from years behind the camera or her habit of watching, patiently, in the background for a story to unfold. </p> <p>At 48, she is editing her 15th film, Fighting Women, a portrait of a Japanese school for women wrestlers. There are Polaroids of them on the table. They are wearing make-up and are a strange mixture of the glamorous and the truck-like. The school, just outside Tokyo, accepts girls between the ages of 15 and 21, and Longinotto's original plan was to film the new recruits as they arrived, again after six weeks, and then return for some final shooting when they stepped into the ring for the first time after six months. But when the recruits were delayed for four weeks, Longinotto and her small team began filming some of the existing first-years and found the story there. </p> <p>\"By the time the others arrived, we had fallen in love with one of the girls who had been doing it for a year and was going to get thrown out. That was a risk because, if she had got thrown out, we wouldn't have a story. But you work out very quickly where your characters are, and have to be dogged about it.\" </p> <p>Female wrestling in Japan routinely attracts audiences of 8,000 and the participants become superstars - as famous as the male WWF contenders in the US. Their stage act is just that - a choreographed sequence that ensures the throws and headlocks they perform on each other won't permanently damage them. </p> <p>This was one of Longinotto's conditions for making the film. She has no taste for violence. \"My mum used to watch wrestling when I was a kid and I used to absolutely hate it. It seemed so cruel. But they assured us that, although it was very skilled, no one would get hurt. We got very into it. We'd be screaming for our girls and they'd all look at us. But I wasn't screaming for anyone to get hurt. That's why I don't like boxing.\" </p> <p>What drew Longinotto to the girls was the same spirit of rebellion that attracted her to the wives of Tehran. In both cases, it is rebellion defined by a resistance to the overarching patriarchy. The conceit of this approach is that you learn more about a country from its outsiders than its establishment. Outsiders, for Longinotto, are merely the future come early. </p> <p>\"There has been a change going on in Iran. As women become more educated, they become more confident. You really get a sense of a place in transit. The modern Iranian woman wants everything: a divorce, a new husband, her kids and she wants to work.\" </p> <p>In Japan, too, there is a notable progression in attitude between the women Longinotto filmed in Dream Girls, her documentary about the students at Takarazuka - a sort of Japanese Royal Ballet school meets the Parachute Regiment - all of whose careers were forcibly ended at 25 with the expectation they would marry, and the female wrestlers. \"The girls at the wrestling school were all saying they didn't want to get married, that this was the best thing they had ever done and that if they'd got married, they would have been fed up. One girl said to her mother, it would be very difficult for me to get married because if my husband hit me, I'd punch him back. Her mother said, well, you can't get married then.\" </p> <p>Longinotto's own relationship with authority has strongly influenced her film-making. When she was nine, her parents, who lived in London, sent her to Hampden House as a boarder. \"I loathed every second of it. And what I hated was the meaningless little tasks that they made you do - just like in Takarazuka, which reminded me very much of my boarding school. They were to do with teaching you not to have self-respect. Things like cutting the lawn with nail scissors. It was like the wearing away of your self-worth.\" </p> <p>The reason her parents sent and kept her there when she was so miserable, particularly during the two years of isolation, was not malice, she suggests, but lack of interest. \"I think that, now, people like my parents wouldn't have had kids. I think then you just did because that's what everybody else did.\" </p> <p>Longinotto repays their neglect with a coldness that might be shocking if you couldn't see her struggling a little to pull it off. \"My mother had a business, but I never quite worked out what it was,\" she says with a light sneer. Is she still in touch with her parents? \"No, well it was my mother's funeral - yesterday? No hang on, what day is it? Tuesday, Tuesday.\" The tone is breezy, but her eyes are on the floor. </p> <p>When she left school, she discovered her father had Italian roots and, after a bit of digging, she took up the abandoned family name of Longinotto. \"A new name with no baggage.\" Rather than go home to her parents, she became homeless, first in London, then in a dusty traipse around Europe. \"It wasn't so bad...\" she begins, before stopping herself. \"No, it was. It was terrible. I was starving. I wouldn't beg, so it was a case of...\" she trails off. Dustbins? \"Mmm. One of my first films was about homeless women in a hostel near Greek Street.\" </p> <p>When she returned to London the prospect of chancing it on the streets once again had lost its charm. She applied and was accepted at Essex university, where she studied English and European literature for three years and decided that she wanted to be a writer. A PhD loomed - she considered doing one on the novel and cinema - but she was saved from it at the 11th hour by Lambeth council. \"I was doing a library project for them, where you go round parks and tell people stories with a microphone and at the end say to them that if they want to read the stories, they should go to the library. But no one ever wanted to go to the library.\" </p> <p>Since one of her main interests was bringing society's marginal figures to a wider audience, she started re-considering her choice of medium. And, after those terrible two years at boarding school, she had a fear of living the life of an isolated writer. \"Also, I'm not very good at writing,\" she whispers. \"That was the main reason, really.\" Instead, she enrolled at film school in Beaconsfield and decided that what she wanted to do was make documentaries about people whom others always presumed to speak for. This is what she saves her quiet urgency for. </p> <p>\"What I love about making documentaries is that I can disappear. It is getting involved in a situation and letting it speak for itself. I love the way you go somewhere and get into another world and lose yourself and discover things you couldn't have imagined. I love that moment when you film something and it unfolds in front of you and it's a privilege to be there and your heart goes and you think, this is happening and I'm filming it. The whole of the Japanese shoot was like that. We'd go back and lie on our beds and go, I can't believe it.\" </p> <p>Gentleness and kindness are not the same thing, but Longinotto has both. We are walking through Soho after the interview when she pulls up sharply to give money to a man under a blanket. This isn't surprising since she has been there herself, but she is mindful of all the characters in the scene. While fishing about in her bag she half turns to me and mumbles \"sorry\" for the delay. \"Sorry, I have to...\" she tails off without finishing, but the story has told itself.</p> <p>\u0095 Kim Longinotto introduces extracts from Fighting Women tonight at 9pm at the Lux Cinema, Hoxton Square, London N1 (Box office: 0171-684 0201).</p>",

The Tories made families a priority but Labour's increases in income support, child benefit and working families tax credit (WFTC) are expected to lift 800,000 children out of poverty before the next election.</p> <p>The great majority of poor families depend entirely on benefits, because they have no job. More than half of poor families are lone parents, who until recently were not even expected to look for work. More than 1m poor children live with both parents, neither of whom is in work. A sustainable policy for abolishing child poverty could not possibly be based simply on paying more generous benefits to such a large number of non-working families. In the end, the strategy has to be to increase the number of parents in work; or at least reduce the length of time they remain outside the labour force.</p> <p>So the government has put its faith in the gospel of work. The flagship policy is Gordon Brown's WFTC, providing incentives for parents to take low-paid work. Recall, though, that in 1988 Norman Fowler was making the same claims for his family credit (and Gordon Brown was vigorously opposing). It hardly solved the problem. WFTC provides rather higher incentives - typically \u00a342 per week for a couple with two children, compared with \u00a331 under the previous regime.

The British Household Panel Survey allows us to follow changes in families' circumstances between 1991 and 1997. Only a quarter of couples with children who were out of work in any given year were in work a year later (though others may have worked for a brief period during the intervening months); the figure for lone parents is just one in ten.

Although those who find work are usually better off than on benefit, a second job is often essential to lift the family clear. Child care may be critical, not just to lone parents' prospects of finding work, but also to whether workless couples can find their way out of poverty.</p> <p>Fathers tend to get jobs based on classical economic factors such as qualifications, health and the availability of work. Mothers' prospects on the other hand are associated with the age of their children and their \"readiness\" to look for work. This is true of both mothers in couples and lone parents.</p> <p>There may be periods in a family's life when a mother cannot leave her children.

We found the more hours they put into these mini-jobs the more likely they were to get a job working more than 16 hours the following year. This kind of employment seems to boost prospects, more than going on a training course does. Why not encourage such small part-time jobs?

      "bodyText": "Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, yesterday repeated Labour's promise to end child poverty - that ambitious target of cutting the number of poor children (4m of them in 1996) by half within 10 years and within 20 years to ensure none lives in poor households. He emphasised that resources would be channelled to that end rather than subsidising unemployment. But what has been proposed so far is unlikely to eliminate so intransigent a problem.

All you'll hear from him, as he deigns to return your calls from a waterraft in the pool he purchased with the profits from your last hit, are the words, \"Yeah, that was then, but what have you done for me lately?\"</p> <p> And it's likely to be a lot more gruelling and disillusioning if you once happened, however briefly, to redefine the prevailing cultural zeitgeist. Thanks to the video generation's high levels of cine-literacy, low boredom threshold and its Internet-derived savviness on all things movie-related, the Hollywood treadmill now has to turn about three times as fast just to keep up. Which means in short: \"So what if you once shook up the ground we stand on, along with all our low expectations and high hopes? Things change, pal.\"</p> <p> Things have certainly changed for people like Kevin Williamson in the few short years since Scream, and for Quentin Tarantino since Pulp Fiction. Each in his different way was once top of the Hollywood heap. Whilst Tarantino managed to transform modern movies with his multi-referential scripts for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, he was very soon swamped by a Gaderene rush of pale imitators and micro-Taranteenies.</p> <p>In the short term these Xerox-artists did as much damage to American film-making as imitators of the late Charles Bukowski and Raymond Carver did to the modern American short story. Every idiot who could heft a copy of Syd Field's knuckleheaded scriptwriting guide - or pony up the scratch to be berated by story-structure guru Robert McKee - got in the act.</p> <p> And Tarantino certainly didn't do his own reputation any favours.

      "bodyText": "Hollywood can be a harsh, cruel place indeed. You know the phrases: \"Last week's hero is next week's zero\" or \"You're only as good as your last picture.\" And the flint-hearted producer who bankrolled your career-making debut isn't likely to be swayed by reminders of how rich you once made him, especially if your last two pictures stank up both the joint and the joint's toilet. Believe me, there'll be no favours coming your way. All you'll hear from him, as he deigns to return your calls from a waterraft in the pool he purchased with the profits from your last hit, are the words, \"Yeah, that was then, but what have you done for me lately?\" And it's likely to be a lot more gruelling and disillusioning if you once happened, however briefly, to redefine the prevailing cultural zeitgeist. Thanks to the video generation's high levels of cine-literacy, low boredom threshold and its Internet-derived savviness on all things movie-related, the Hollywood treadmill now has to turn about three times as fast just to keep up. Which means in short: \"So what if you once shook up the ground we stand on, along with all our low expectations and high hopes? Things change, pal.\" Things have certainly changed for people like Kevin Williamson in the few short years since Scream, and for Quentin Tarantino since Pulp Fiction. Each in his different way was once top of the Hollywood heap. Whilst Tarantino managed to transform modern movies with his multi-referential scripts for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, he was very soon swamped by a Gaderene rush of pale imitators and micro-Taranteenies. In the short term these Xerox-artists did as much damage to American film-making as imitators of the late Charles Bukowski and Raymond Carver did to the modern American short story. Every idiot who could heft a copy of Syd Field's knuckleheaded scriptwriting guide - or pony up the scratch to be berated by story-structure guru Robert McKee - got in the act. And Tarantino certainly didn't do his own reputation any favours. Originally he'd wanted to be an actor and once he'd hit the jackpot as a writer-director he indulged himself insanely. There were guest appearances in disasters like Destiny Turns On the Radio (and John Patterson Flings it Out the Bloody Window), and the rank-pulling decision to essay the second male lead in From Dusk Till Dawn. With his immobile, banana-shaped visage and his reedy, characterless speaking voice, a movie would stop dead in its tracks once Tarantino walked from behind the camera and into the shot. Once you become as powerful as in Hollywood as Tarantino suddenly did, you will find the talent banging on your door and telling you everything you want to hear.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\"It's not what I wrote,\" whispers Maurice Bendrix, the obsessively jealous novelist in Neil Jordan's extravagant, expansive version of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair. He is wincing and grimacing in a 1940s fleapit auditorium where they are showing a (crass) adaptation of one of his books. </p> <p>The hazardous transforming of literature into cinema is so important here: both as a professional preoccupation for Greene - novelist, movie critic, screenwriter - and as a metaphor for disappointed expectations, and a loss of control. It stands for a fastidious aesthetic sense of something having turned out wrong in the wide world: compromised, modified, spoilt. And it is audacious of Neil Jordan to have included the \"not-what-I-wrote\" moment, because this sure isn't what Greene wrote. In fact, for all its stylistic felicities, intelligently calibrated performances, and period furniture, this turns out to be a bit of a travesty. </p> <p>Ralph Fiennes plays Bendrix, the tense writer in wartime London. Excused khaki because of his gammy leg, he falls into a tragic affair with Sarah, the beautiful, elegant wife of a stuffy civil servant. She is played by Julianne Moore, a very great deal of whose energies are channelled into replicating the perfect English accent. Her concentration is clearly heavily invested here and there is thus something too reticent about the rest of her performance as she glides about; even for an Englishwoman there is little abandon in her love scenes - hardly worth that 18 certificate, incidentally - and her adagio approach only really comes into its own for her final, affecting death-bed scene. </p> <p>Fiennes himself is simply remarkable. There is no other actor who could have played this role and, as with his Onegin last year, there is an unmatched maturity and complexity to his screen presence: a jaggedness, a simmering amour propre, a neurotic obsessiveness, an importunate yearning. There is a great and terrible wound somewhere in his heart. Perhaps the nearest comparison I can think of is Dirk Bogarde, though, as a performer, Fiennes is the warmer and more forthcoming of the two. The cuckold himself, Henry Miles, is played by Stephen Rea, whose dopey, mopey, hangdog face perfectly conveys his hopelessness, especially under the dead weight of his Homburg hat. </p> <p>Where Jordan succeeds triumphantly is in reproducing the heavy, gloomy sick-room atmosphere of guilt and shame and discomfiture in post-war Britain. The movie reeks of damp, cheap clothing drying out in front of a gas fire. It is a world of miserable, sooty pubs, cardboard bus-tickets, the weighty chink of two-bob bits and pennies the size of manhole covers - the heavy coins that told Orwell he was back home. Bendrix and Sarah have fully clothed illicit sex on her sofa, not, you feel, because it's erotic but because in an age before central heating nothing else is tolerable. </p> <p>But where Jordan fails is in his diminution of the importance of God. Sarah ends their affair because she loves him so much. A cradle Catholic, she offers God a deal when she finds Bendrix's apparently dead body in the rubble caused by a V2 rocket: bring Maurice back to life, she says, and she will resume the sacrament of marriage with her husband. </p> <p>In Greene's book, this is a sacrifice taken seriously; she keeps her bargain, never returns to Bendrix's bed, and doesn't tell him why. This quixotic insistence is what gives her pathos and tragic grandeur. But Jordan appears simply to tear up the betting slip that underpins that Pascal wager on God's existence. When Bendrix finally discovers the truth with the help of a private detective (the perennially excellent Ian Hart) Sarah winds up melting into his arms anyway, and Jordan awards them a vulgar sexual reunion, complete with raffish weekend away in Brighton. </p> <p>There are other problems in the liberties Jordan takes. In Greene's novel, the other man Sarah has been seeing is not a lover but a rationalist thinker determined to argue her out of her faith. Jordan turns him into a solemn dog-collared priest. This paradoxically reduces the religious element; there is no worrisome, quarrelsome debate, none of the Greeneian poignancy and uncertainty. </p> <p>\"People go on loving God all their lives, without seeing Him.\" This is how Sarah tells Maurice that their love will continue after she can't see him any more. The End of the Affair conveys a terrible view of the end of love, and the need for some comforting faith in absent love, which, in turn, affords a glimpse of something other than the comforts and the trials of this world. </p> <p>Neil Jordan's movie admirably conveys the secular half of this agony and, by giving their affair its Second Act, as it were, he gives it a more vivid and cinematic life. But in abolishing Sarah's bargain, he diminishes her sacrifice for God. It is a substantial loss because, without this sacrifice, The End of the Affair is, really, a little banal.</p>",

It told the waiting world that the cost of borrowing was going up from 5.75% to 6% and left it at that. No explanation, no mention of what was worrying the nine-strong monetary policy committee. </p> <p>Away from Threadneedle Street, there were plenty of people who wanted their say. The CBI and the TUC claimed that, with the pound already too strong for comfort, the result would be even more pain for manufacturers and exporters. </p> <p>The chancellor attracted his share of brickbats, despite washing his hands of monetary policy in May 1997. Gordon Brown had made it clear that he wanted rates to go up, and they duly did. There were grumbles from the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers Federation, which both want fiscal policy to be tightened in the budget to take the heat off monetary policy. </p> <p>Three questions arise from the rates decision. The first - why the Bank did it - is easy to answer. Every member of the MPC has been surprised at the resilience of the economy over the past year, and fears that inflation will rise above the government's 2.5% target. </p> <p>There is no shortage of evidence to back up the hawkish case.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England was in non-communicative mood yesterday when it put up rates for the fourth time in six months. It told the waiting world that the cost of borrowing was going up from 5.75% to 6% and left it at that. No explanation, no mention of what was worrying the nine-strong monetary policy committee. Away from Threadneedle Street, there were plenty of people who wanted their say. The CBI and the TUC claimed that, with the pound already too strong for comfort, the result would be even more pain for manufacturers and exporters. The chancellor attracted his share of brickbats, despite washing his hands of monetary policy in May 1997. Gordon Brown had made it clear that he wanted rates to go up, and they duly did. There were grumbles from the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers Federation, which both want fiscal policy to be tightened in the budget to take the heat off monetary policy. Three questions arise from the rates decision. The first - why the Bank did it - is easy to answer. Every member of the MPC has been surprised at the resilience of the economy over the past year, and fears that inflation will rise above the government's 2.5% target. There is no shortage of evidence to back up the hawkish case. The Bank could take its pick from the strength of growth in the second half of 1999, the buoyancy of consumer spending, signs that the booming property market is triggering a wave of equity withdrawal, the tightness of the labour market following the decline in unemployment to a 20-year-low. Suggestions that Britain is enjoying its own new paradigm, with competitive markets and new technology driving down prices, have yet to impress the MPC. What happens next?

Amid this howling maelstrom, contemporary glumsters like Placebo are revealed to be mere pygmies of pain. It's followed by a swollen Bloodflowers and an encore of A Forest, effectively the first goth song, and there feels something quite noble about a man so unrepentantly immovable in his obsessions. </p> <p>How much longer Robert Smith ought to sustain his adolescent world view is uncertain. As usual, he has claimed that this will be the last Cure album, but whether he really means it or not at least this would be an honourable valediction.
