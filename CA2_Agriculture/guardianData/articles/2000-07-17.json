      "bodyText": "Tony Blair faced renewed embarrassment last night when it emerged that his leaked memo mirrored an editorial published in the Daily Mail on the day that he put pen to paper. In a powerful sign of the hold that middle market tabloids have over the prime minister, all but one of his five \"thoughts\" were raised in the editorial which lambasted Mr Blair for being \"openly contemptuous of public opinion\". The editorial rounded on the government in the wake of a series of ministerial attacks on William Hague for defending the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who was jailed for the murder of a teenage burglar. The Mail asked its readers: \"Feel queasy about how the law dealt with Tony Martin? A 'progressive' legal establishment that has presided over an explosion in crime since the war will mark you down as an ignorant vigilante.\" Mr Blair's first \"thought\" in his memo was about the Martin case. The editorial said that the Martin case highlighted the need for tougher sentencing of the teenagers who hounded Martin - Mr Blair's third \"thought\" in which he wrote of the need to highlight \"tough measures\". After its defence of Martin the Mail turned its fire on the government's handling of asylum seekers - Mr Blair's second \"thought\". The paper then condemned the government for opposing section 28, and its decision to abolish the married couple's tax allowance - Mr Blair's fifth \"thought\". The government last night denied that the prime minister had been influenced by the Mail. The Scottish secretary, John Reid, told Channel 4 News: \"Finding one [editorial] on one particular day where some of the themes coincide with some of the themes the prime minister wants to mention within one of hundreds of memos, isn't exactly Sherlock Holmes, it's more like Inspector Clouseau.\"",

He was shouting resignation threats, attacking the decision taken, and he came round the table to leer at me and said we had made a great blunder tonight - 'Not the first you have made', he said.\" Thus wrote Harold Wilson, of George Brown, on March 18 1968. If it had got out, it would have spoiled Wilson's holiday. Like Tony Blair, he was living on his nerve-ends.</p> <p>The political scene was in fact more neuralgic in those days than it is now. Less than three years into power, the Wilson government was always in a state of panic, as the diarists inside the cabinet recorded. \"Number 10 lives in an atmosphere of intrigue,\" noted Tony Benn on August 5 1966, \"encouraged by George Wigg who is completely crazy, Marcia [Falkender] who gets a bit hysterical and Gerald Kaufman who just sits wisely and nods.\" There are no demented analogues in residence in 2000 yet, not even Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>Wilson's preoccupations, though, were different from Blair's. The diaries open up a world that is barely recognisable today, in which the media featured little and the public not at all. The talk is all of speeches to be made, cabinets to be squared, parliament to be won, and the party to be stitched up. That is how politics used to be. Richard Crossman and Barbara Castle chronicle incessant anti-Wilson plotting that was second nature to the Labour party of the 1960s, but against a background of bloody argument about principle and policy that hardly exists at all in the 2000s.</p> <p>Arguably, Mr Blair's April memo, baring his anxieties about what voters will think of him, is updating the Wilson era, simply identifying a new set of enemies. Modern leaders may be obliged to see the media as the new conspirators to be schemed against day and night. The public, not parliament, are the agents whose opinion will decide. The memo, so nakedly concerned with impression over substance, might be called benign in its search for a direct connection with the people. Perhaps a prime minister obsessed with pleasing the electorate is preferable to one obsessed with balancing five fractions of the Tribune group of MPs.</p> <p>There is something in this. Mr Blair is demonstrably a leader who cares about his programme. He is not, deep at heart, a cynic. His concern for appearances can be explained by his perception that, unless the government tries to control them, these will be determined by people who have no interest in creating a mood of national optimism or even vague approval for what is going on. Though Wilson had many run-ins with the newspapers, he didn't have to live with the power of the media to drown every version of the truth except their own.</p> <p>All the same, the tenor of the memo is terribly depressing. It shows the lengths to which a desperate man has been driven, away from the steady path of purposeful reform into the dead end of instant wheezes and bogus responses. Private though it was meant to be, it is one of those papers whose secrecy enhances rather than distorts its ghastly veracity. It lines up in black and white the government's two most crippling tendencies.</p> <p>First, we learn how little policy in the field of law and order is sane, rational or orderly. It is not substance-based but initiative-based. Do anything as long as it looks harsh. The words from the top are there for all to study. It's all about being seen to do \"something tough, with immediate bite\". This is already the policy, an aggrieved prime minister writes. But because people don't understand that, harder things must be invented to make sure they get the message. Jack up the figures, rush in the laws, hammer home the asylum-removals. And then increase the defence budget for no better reason than to be seen \"standing up for Britain\".</p> <p>Running through these law and order attitudes is Mr Blair's own most consistent defect as a progressive politician: his indifference to, almost his contempt for, civil liberties. I've never heard him giving them priority. At the last party conference he spat on the very concept. In this field he's been the crudest populist, masquerading behind the smile of a man of reason. More generally, in obeisance to family and patriotism alike, he seems prepared to reduce all policy-making to the service of his next mandate. Ask not how you can lead the people, but how you decipher their instincts and then gratify them. Very regrettably, this, defiling much that has been well done, is what it has come to.</p> <p>But it may not be the most ominous defect that now comes into full focus. The second theme running through the not-for-your-eyes message is the leader's concentration on himself. When he emphasises that \"I personally should be associated with as much of this as possible\", he reflects the way the politics of New Labour have been conducted for six years. He did, after all, believe the only way to guarantee victory in 1997 was by ensuring that his alone was the voice the country heard. And he has done much with power by his personal qualities: think of Ireland, education, parts of Europe. But presidentialism now aspires to go further. It can be a dangerously counter-productive style.</p> <p>For one thing it has weakened Labour's greatest source of strength, the colossal parliamentary majority. This is a startling perversity. The government is now tossing about as if it were living on a parliamentary knife-edge, a direct result of Blairite arrogance and mismanagement. If you weaken parliament's importance, you cannot mobilise its strength. We entirely forget that this government is the strongest in living memory, for the unhappy reason that its leader behaves like one whose strength resides almost entirely within himself. His colleagues barely count. Not only parliament but the cabinet will be missing from any ministerial diaries of the power-struggles in the first Blair term.</p> <p>In place of the collective, one man has ruled the zeitgeist. One man, unfortunately, is a frail performer. He cannot do it all, and if he falters, who takes up the slack? So strong a year ago, he is capable of weakening, and has not placed much of a safety-net below. We begin to get intimations of a style that needs drastically to change, yet one that may already have made too many enemies, especially in his own party, to enable this easily to be done. The leak is a vile blow, against the right of leaders to ruminate and direct. But it's a savage caution, and it does not tell a lie.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com </a></p>",

Richard Crossman and Barbara Castle chronicle incessant anti-Wilson plotting that was second nature to the Labour party of the 1960s, but against a background of bloody argument about principle and policy that hardly exists at all in the 2000s. Arguably, Mr Blair's April memo, baring his anxieties about what voters will think of him, is updating the Wilson era, simply identifying a new set of enemies. Modern leaders may be obliged to see the media as the new conspirators to be schemed against day and night. The public, not parliament, are the agents whose opinion will decide. The memo, so nakedly concerned with impression over substance, might be called benign in its search for a direct connection with the people. Perhaps a prime minister obsessed with pleasing the electorate is preferable to one obsessed with balancing five fractions of the Tribune group of MPs. There is something in this. Mr Blair is demonstrably a leader who cares about his programme. He is not, deep at heart, a cynic. His concern for appearances can be explained by his perception that, unless the government tries to control them, these will be determined by people who have no interest in creating a mood of national optimism or even vague approval for what is going on. Though Wilson had many run-ins with the newspapers, he didn't have to live with the power of the media to drown every version of the truth except their own. All the same, the tenor of the memo is terribly depressing. It shows the lengths to which a desperate man has been driven, away from the steady path of purposeful reform into the dead end of instant wheezes and bogus responses. Private though it was meant to be, it is one of those papers whose secrecy enhances rather than distorts its ghastly veracity. It lines up in black and white the government's two most crippling tendencies. First, we learn how little policy in the field of law and order is sane, rational or orderly. It is not substance-based but initiative-based. Do anything as long as it looks harsh. The words from the top are there for all to study. It's all about being seen to do \"something tough, with immediate bite\". This is already the policy, an aggrieved prime minister writes. But because people don't understand that, harder things must be invented to make sure they get the message. Jack up the figures, rush in the laws, hammer home the asylum-removals. And then increase the defence budget for no better reason than to be seen \"standing up for Britain\". Running through these law and order attitudes is Mr Blair's own most consistent defect as a progressive politician: his indifference to, almost his contempt for, civil liberties. I've never heard him giving them priority. At the last party conference he spat on the very concept. In this field he's been the crudest populist, masquerading behind the smile of a man of reason. More generally, in obeisance to family and patriotism alike, he seems prepared to reduce all policy-making to the service of his next mandate. Ask not how you can lead the people, but how you decipher their instincts and then gratify them. Very regrettably, this, defiling much that has been well done, is what it has come to. But it may not be the most ominous defect that now comes into full focus. The second theme running through the not-for-your-eyes message is the leader's concentration on himself. When he emphasises that \"I personally should be associated with as much of this as possible\", he reflects the way the politics of New Labour have been conducted for six years. He did, after all, believe the only way to guarantee victory in 1997 was by ensuring that his alone was the voice the country heard. And he has done much with power by his personal qualities: think of Ireland, education, parts of Europe. But presidentialism now aspires to go further. It can be a dangerously counter-productive style. For one thing it has weakened Labour's greatest source of strength, the colossal parliamentary majority. This is a startling perversity. The government is now tossing about as if it were living on a parliamentary knife-edge, a direct result of Blairite arrogance and mismanagement. If you weaken parliament's importance, you cannot mobilise its strength. We entirely forget that this government is the strongest in living memory, for the unhappy reason that its leader behaves like one whose strength resides almost entirely within himself. His colleagues barely count. Not only parliament but the cabinet will be missing from any ministerial diaries of the power-struggles in the first Blair term. In place of the collective, one man has ruled the zeitgeist. One man, unfortunately, is a frail performer. He cannot do it all, and if he falters, who takes up the slack? So strong a year ago, he is capable of weakening, and has not placed much of a safety-net below. We begin to get intimations of a style that needs drastically to change, yet one that may already have made too many enemies, especially in his own party, to enable this easily to be done. The leak is a vile blow, against the right of leaders to ruminate and direct. But it's a savage caution, and it does not tell a lie. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "body": "<p>As Palestinians and Israelis wrangle at Camp David, Bill Clinton may be reminded of a dispute that wise King Solomon, builder of the temple in Jerusalem, settled 3,000 years ago. Confronted by two women, both of whom claimed the same baby, Solomon suggested cutting the child in half. At that, one of the women offered to let the other take the child, if only the king would spare its life. Seeing her concern, Solomon knew instantly that she was the true mother.</p> <p>The problem for Clinton over the fate of Jerusalem is that neither claimant gives the required response. One would happily split the child in two; one insists on keeping it while allowing the other to look after parts. The solution - both for Jerusalem and the Occupied Territories - is simple in theory. It means resolving rival claims of sovereignty and control so that granting ownership to one side is balanced by granting rights to the other. The difficult part is how to do this fairly.</p> <p>A deal can be worked out over the West Bank, creating a Palestinian state while allowing the Israelis to retain some settlements. But the Palestinians are worried at the control this would mean ceding to the Israelis. How to give access to settlers from Israel proper without making a mockery of a Palestinian state? Jerusalem involves matters of principle, since both sides want it as their capital. Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak proposed extending the city's boundaries to accommodate a Palestinian seat of government but insists on having sovereignty, even though he might not object to Palestinian flags flying in parts of it.</p> <p>On the Palestinian side Yasser Arafat cannot afford to concede sovereignty of East Jerusalem to the Israelis. Apart from finishing him politically, it would cause fury in the rest of the Arab and Muslim world. President Clinton may therefore have to propose a third way which might, for instance, involve internationalising or \"Vaticanising\" the old (religious) part of the city. Some Israelis would certainly reject that, so if he can come up with a solution which is acceptable to both sides it will be nothing short of a triumph. The failings of his presidency could deservedly be forgiven, if not forgotten.</p> <p>Despite the news blackout at Camp David, it is clear from leaks to the Arab and Is raeli press that the talks have now moved from the first phase - establishing the bottom line on each side - to the stage where the Americans seek to close the gaps. This is the most delicate part because Mr Clinton not only has to demonstrate to both sides that he has workable proposals and earnestly wants to strike a deal, but must also secure the confidence of the Palestinians who, up to now, have regarded his administration as more concerned with Mr Barak's problems than their own.</p> <p>Apart from ideas, the main things the Americans can bring to the table are money and security guarantees. Money can lubricate a deal by making minor concessions easier to accept. Mr Clinton will almost certainly make an attractive \"unrepeatable\" offer of aid to a Palestinian state, and more money would help towards solving the refugee problem.</p> <p>Money would also be needed for construction work to provide sensible and secure movement within Jerusalem, between the West Bank and Gaza, and between Israel and any remaining settlements. The Israelis, in addition, will want money to resettle displaced settlers behind the 1967 borders, and money for weapons - essential, they will say - to guarantee their security.

      "bodyText": "As Palestinians and Israelis wrangle at Camp David, Bill Clinton may be reminded of a dispute that wise King Solomon, builder of the temple in Jerusalem, settled 3,000 years ago. Confronted by two women, both of whom claimed the same baby, Solomon suggested cutting the child in half. At that, one of the women offered to let the other take the child, if only the king would spare its life. Seeing her concern, Solomon knew instantly that she was the true mother. The problem for Clinton over the fate of Jerusalem is that neither claimant gives the required response. One would happily split the child in two; one insists on keeping it while allowing the other to look after parts. The solution - both for Jerusalem and the Occupied Territories - is simple in theory. It means resolving rival claims of sovereignty and control so that granting ownership to one side is balanced by granting rights to the other. The difficult part is how to do this fairly. A deal can be worked out over the West Bank, creating a Palestinian state while allowing the Israelis to retain some settlements. But the Palestinians are worried at the control this would mean ceding to the Israelis. How to give access to settlers from Israel proper without making a mockery of a Palestinian state? Jerusalem involves matters of principle, since both sides want it as their capital. Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak proposed extending the city's boundaries to accommodate a Palestinian seat of government but insists on having sovereignty, even though he might not object to Palestinian flags flying in parts of it. On the Palestinian side Yasser Arafat cannot afford to concede sovereignty of East Jerusalem to the Israelis. Apart from finishing him politically, it would cause fury in the rest of the Arab and Muslim world. President Clinton may therefore have to propose a third way which might, for instance, involve internationalising or \"Vaticanising\" the old (religious) part of the city. Some Israelis would certainly reject that, so if he can come up with a solution which is acceptable to both sides it will be nothing short of a triumph. The failings of his presidency could deservedly be forgiven, if not forgotten. Despite the news blackout at Camp David, it is clear from leaks to the Arab and Is raeli press that the talks have now moved from the first phase - establishing the bottom line on each side - to the stage where the Americans seek to close the gaps. This is the most delicate part because Mr Clinton not only has to demonstrate to both sides that he has workable proposals and earnestly wants to strike a deal, but must also secure the confidence of the Palestinians who, up to now, have regarded his administration as more concerned with Mr Barak's problems than their own. Apart from ideas, the main things the Americans can bring to the table are money and security guarantees. Money can lubricate a deal by making minor concessions easier to accept. Mr Clinton will almost certainly make an attractive \"unrepeatable\" offer of aid to a Palestinian state, and more money would help towards solving the refugee problem. Money would also be needed for construction work to provide sensible and secure movement within Jerusalem, between the West Bank and Gaza, and between Israel and any remaining settlements. The Israelis, in addition, will want money to resettle displaced settlers behind the 1967 borders, and money for weapons - essential, they will say - to guarantee their security. The cost would certainly run into tens of billions of dollars. Both sides will be looking for firm promises from the Americans but Mr Clinton cannot be sure how the Congress will respond to what is perceived by some as his personal \"legacy project\". After 50 years of conflict it would scarcely be surprising if the talks failed - though barring a dramatic walk-out, a failure would more likely be described officially as an adjournment, if only to hold off Mr Arafat's threatened unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. Whatever happens on other issues, the refugee question cannot be totally resolved at Camp David because it involves other countries who are not represented - notably Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - but a framework for a solution could be established. The most easily achievable outcome, an incomplete deal creating a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza but postponing the question of Jerusalem, seems the least likely. At this stage, neither side regards such a deal, on its own, as worth having. The Palestinians remain suspicious of Mr Clinton's assumed role as an honest broker, and some suggest it would be better to wait for the next president.

But another motive for his decision emerged later when he admitted that he believed he could be the next target in the government's drive to tackle corruption. Observers believe the real motive may only become clear in time. Mr Berezovsky, once an impoverished mathematician, transformed himself into a multi-billionaire in the 1990s and soon became the most notorious of Russia's oligarchs - the well-connected businessmen who made their fortunes buying up state assets cheap in the chaotic post-Soviet period. In the past week the government has begun prosecuting some of the country's most powerful business figures, and the president has warned that he will not tolerate \"shadowy\" business groups operating in the economy. As a member of parliament, Mr Berezovsky is theoretically immune from prosecution, but yesterday he described this guarantee as worthless, and added that he had decided to renounce his parliamentary immunity in any case, so that he was on an \"equal footing\" with those businessmen already facing prosecution. In a strong indication that Mr Berezovsky's warm relations with the Kremlin have cooled in the months since Mr Putin became president, he said he believed that ultimately all the oligarchs would be affected by the drive, which he called \"an orchestrated campaign, directed at destroying major independent businesses\". He called for an amnesty, arguing that anybody recently involved in business in in Russia must at some point have acted illegally, because of the chaotic laws governing business transactions. \"Only those people who have been asleep for the past 10 years have avoided willingly or unwillingly breaking the law,\" he said, adding: \"And those sitting in the Kremlin are in the same situation.\" Mr Berezovsky was an intimate associate of Mr Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, and for years served as the linchpin of the group of backroom advisers who wielded immense influence over the president.

      "bodyText": "Fears that political concerns could block the sale of the Belfast Telegraph to Tony O'Reilly's Independent News &amp; Media proved unfounded yesterday when the deal was waved through by Stephen Byers. The sale of the paper by Trinity Mirror in March attracted strong criticism that a paper with a moderate Unionist editorial line should pass to Mr O'Reilly's Dublin-based group. The trade and industry secretary said he had been \"mindful of the particular importance of the accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion in Northern Ireland\" but concluded the change of ownership would not work against public interest. The competition commission had found no reason to doubt Mr O'Reilly's commitment to maintaining the editorial freedom of the Telegraph and it made no commercial sense to alter this stance. John Taylor, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said yesterday he was \"pleased that almost all of the concerns which we had expressed appear to have been addressed\". Regional newspaper group Trinity was forced to sell the Telegraph as a condition of its acquisition of Mirror Group. Mr O'Reilly's business, which owns the Irish Independent and the Independent titles in London, is paying \u00a3300m.",

      "body": "<p>\"You'll be better off if we stay a building society\" said Mr Bradford, raising his bowler hat. \"Oh yes, if we became a bank, we would have to raise mortgage rates and lower savings rates,\" agreed Mr Bingley. </p> <p>Not our words. They are taken from the defence documents issued by Bradford &amp; Bingley in March last year when it was fighting off a carpetbagging resolution. And not words that the members found very persuasive, voting yesterday nine to one in favour of demutualising and windfalls that may average about \u00a3730. </p> <p>Messrs Bradford &amp; Bingley ate their hats immediately after they lost to the carpetbaggers resolution last year, with the board switching sides with almost unseemly haste. Ahead of yesterday's vote, the documents sang a different tune, saying that conversion would mean little change for customers. </p> <p>The truth perhaps lies more in the original defence documents than in the conversion proposal. Last year B&amp;B's standard variable mortgage rate was only a smidgen above mutual benchmark-setter Nationwide. Now, as it prepares to float, the rate nearly matches the Halifax rate of 7.74%. Expect to see the converse happen with savings rates. </p> <p>Handing profits to shareholders cannot happen without widening margins. The surprise in yesterday's result was not the huge majority of savers in favour of conversion (\u00a3100 in the account for a \u00a3730 return), but the number of pro-demutualisation mortgage holders, who will be hit by higher interest rates. One can only guess that either they have not worked out the sums properly - higher rates will wipe out the windfall gain in about three to four years - or that they are also savers who will be doubling or tripling up on windfalls. </p> <p>A wave of \"it's the end of mutuality\" comment will follow the vote, but do not read too much into this. The suspicion remains that the B&amp;B board was never truly committed, in the style of Standard Life and Nationwide, to mutuality. It left its doors open to carpetbaggers for so long that come the vote, almost a third of its members were new \u00a3100 account holders who were never going to do anything other than vote for conversion. </p> <p>One of the biggest windfalls has already been handed out; chief executive Christopher Rodrigues saw his pay leap 48% last year to a bank-style \u00a3654,048. </p> <p><strong> Diageoland </strong><br> </p> <p>If you believe Diageo, consumers no longer distinguish between the separate worlds of beer, wine and spirits drinking. </p> <p>In Diageoland, we slug Gordon's Space (an unlikely combination of Gordon's gin, lemon juice and ginseng) plus pints of Guinness and shots of J&amp;B whisky as the setting demands. </p> <p>This future was mapped out by the chief executive-designate, Paul Walsh. But aside from his determination to tap into things like \"high value adult drinking occasions,\" there is plenty of sense in the (belated) plan to amalgamate its two drinks arms, Guinness and UDV. </p> <p>Merging its Minneapolis-based Pillsbury food subsidiary with General Mills also sounds reasonable enough.

      "bodyText": "\"You'll be better off if we stay a building society\" said Mr Bradford, raising his bowler hat. \"Oh yes, if we became a bank, we would have to raise mortgage rates and lower savings rates,\" agreed Mr Bingley. Not our words. They are taken from the defence documents issued by Bradford &amp; Bingley in March last year when it was fighting off a carpetbagging resolution. And not words that the members found very persuasive, voting yesterday nine to one in favour of demutualising and windfalls that may average about \u00a3730. Messrs Bradford &amp; Bingley ate their hats immediately after they lost to the carpetbaggers resolution last year, with the board switching sides with almost unseemly haste. Ahead of yesterday's vote, the documents sang a different tune, saying that conversion would mean little change for customers. The truth perhaps lies more in the original defence documents than in the conversion proposal. Last year B&amp;B's standard variable mortgage rate was only a smidgen above mutual benchmark-setter Nationwide. Now, as it prepares to float, the rate nearly matches the Halifax rate of 7.74%. Expect to see the converse happen with savings rates. Handing profits to shareholders cannot happen without widening margins. The surprise in yesterday's result was not the huge majority of savers in favour of conversion (\u00a3100 in the account for a \u00a3730 return), but the number of pro-demutualisation mortgage holders, who will be hit by higher interest rates. One can only guess that either they have not worked out the sums properly - higher rates will wipe out the windfall gain in about three to four years - or that they are also savers who will be doubling or tripling up on windfalls. A wave of \"it's the end of mutuality\" comment will follow the vote, but do not read too much into this. The suspicion remains that the B&amp;B board was never truly committed, in the style of Standard Life and Nationwide, to mutuality. It left its doors open to carpetbaggers for so long that come the vote, almost a third of its members were new \u00a3100 account holders who were never going to do anything other than vote for conversion. One of the biggest windfalls has already been handed out; chief executive Christopher Rodrigues saw his pay leap 48% last year to a bank-style \u00a3654,048. Diageoland If you believe Diageo, consumers no longer distinguish between the separate worlds of beer, wine and spirits drinking. In Diageoland, we slug Gordon's Space (an unlikely combination of Gordon's gin, lemon juice and ginseng) plus pints of Guinness and shots of J&amp;B whisky as the setting demands. This future was mapped out by the chief executive-designate, Paul Walsh. But aside from his determination to tap into things like \"high value adult drinking occasions,\" there is plenty of sense in the (belated) plan to amalgamate its two drinks arms, Guinness and UDV. Merging its Minneapolis-based Pillsbury food subsidiary with General Mills also sounds reasonable enough. This will create the third biggest food group in the US and will send the shivers up Nestl\u00e9, which has failed to join the restructuring binge. Critics were peeved that Diageo will still hold a 33% interest in General Mills as a term of the \u00a37bn merger deal. They wanted a clean exit. But that was curmudgeonly. The overall price was good and Diageo will run down its General Mills stake as soon as practicable. Sunrise scenario You are a Japanese policymaker. It is the turn of your country to host the annual summit and Bill, Tony, Gerhard and the rest of the chaps are about to jet in ...

Dealers have been watching turnover in the company, chaired by Lawrie Lewis of Blenheim fame, over the past couple of sessions and have concluded that something could be up. The shares, which have been on a roll-coaster ride this year, ticked up 2p to 70p yesterday as further 774,000 changed hands. According to speculation, the company has received an informal approach and a bid at around the 100p per share is expected any day. Names in the frame include Euromoney Institutional investor, dealers say. ITE's position as a leading exhibition organiser certainly makes it an attractive target. The group now arranges over 350 trade exhibitions a year. Hugh Bidwell, deputy chief chairman of ITE, told the Guardian he was not aware of any formal approach, however.",

Cash from the Pillsbury deal is expected to fund a spending spree, with Seagram's liquor assets likely to top the list. A share buyback is in prospect. Paul Walsh, Diageo's chief executive-designate, yesterday refused to put a number on the redundancies but said the London head offices of UDV and Guinness would be combined under plans to secure savings of \u00a3130m a year. Analysts predicted that 10% of the combined UDV and Guinness staffs of 30,000 worldwide could go (17,000 are employed by UDV). Mr Walsh played down the magnitude of the cuts but admitted senior and middle management would not be spared as sales, marketing and consumer research functions were merged. \"Our objective is to streamline but we do not have the scope on absolute numbers yet,\" said Mr Walsh. He ex pected to give an outline of staffing levels to employees, possibly within the week. The integration of Diageo's spirits business, which produces Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Smirnoff, will cost \u00a3170m in exceptional charges but secure savings of \u00a3100m by year three and the full \u00a3130m by year five. Diageo's goal is to achieve a winning share of \"high value adult drinking occasions\" within a global market estimated by the company to be worth \u00a35bn a year. The Pillsbury-General Mills deal was agreed during weekend talks between the boards of the two firms in Minneapolis, where both are based. Mr Walsh said the \"dream deal\" needed the approval of US regulators and shareholders but expected the deal to be completed by the year end. Some small sales might be demanded as the price of the regulatory go-ahead. General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereals, will pay 141m shares valued at $5.4m (\u00a33.6m) and take on $5.1bn of debt for Pillsbury, producer of Old El Paso corn chips and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. This will leave Diageo with 33% of the combined General Mills-Pillsbury and two board seats. Diageo intends to sell down at least 75% of this stake over 10 years. This is the latest restructuring of the US food sector where Unilever recently paid $24.3bn to buy Bestfoods and Philip Morris spent $18.9bn on Nabisco Holdings. The Pillsbury sale would enhance Diageo's earnings per share by as much as 6% on a pro forma basis before goodwill and exceptional items during fiscal 2001, said finance director Nick Rose. The stock market liked the deal and pushed up Diageo shares 13p to 610p. The company hopes for its shares to be rerated once it is perceived as a pure drinks company. Diageo next year will float 20% of Burger King with the rest going by 2003. The company made clear it was interested in the assets being disposed of by Seagram due to its merger with Vivendi of France.",

The industry admitted that the time had come to clean up its act, a resolve which is likely to cut off one of the biggest sources of funding for the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone and the Unita rebels in Angola. The notoriously secretive industry, which is holdings its biannual congress in the Belgian city of Antwerp, is expected to endorse a new set of rules tomorrow. The impetus for change is a radical set of proposals from the International Diamond Manufacturers' Association, which represents the world's 10 biggest manufacturing centres. The proposals envisage every parcel of diamonds being accompanied by a detailed certificate of origin, and anyone caught dealing in conflict diamonds being banned from trading for life. The industry has been under enormous pressure from non-governmental organisations and governments such as Britain's to end the trade in diamonds from rebel groups to help restore peace and human rights in Africa. The threat of a possible consumer boycott of diamonds and a media campaign against the trade has persuaded the industry that it is now in its in terests to tackle the problem. Robert Fowler, the Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, who supports sanctions against Unita, hailed the industry's change of heart. \"What is so exciting for all of us today is that this is the first time we're talking about a comprehensive approach,\" he said. Peter Hain, the Foreign Office minister with responsibility for Africa, warned that the change would come too late for hundreds of thousands of Angolans and Sierra Leoneans who have suffered in wars financed by diamonds, but said that industry action was exactly what was needed. \"We now have the basis to form an international accreditation system and all diamonds exported will have to have a proper certificate.

He urged diamond buyers not to buy any stones from Sierra Leone, Angola or the Democratic Republic of Congo since the situation was, he argued, too confused. Peter Meeus, general manager of Antwerp's Diamond High Council, which oversees the world's biggest trading centre, stressed that the industry should not be made a scapegoat for Africa's ills, adding that only 4% of diamonds came from conflict areas. \"It is unfair and dishonest to put the blame on the industry, because it's small and employs a small number of people\" he said. \"We are ethical people and we want to help, but the diamond industry should not stand alone in taking the blame for all that goes wrong in Africa.\" \"We have a responsibility, but at a certain moment our responsibility ends and we are not the international police.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Popular Supreme in software but an internet laggard for several years, Microsoft yesterday proclaimed it had the world's most popular website with 201m unique users last month. The figures, helped by Microsoft's number one slot in the British market as well as elsewhere around the world, beat those published by Yahoo! , the internet portal, for the same period. Yahoo!, which announced 156m unique users in the same period, refused to comment on the Microsoft results. However, it has also described itself as the \"leading, global branded web network\". \u0095 Oversubscribed The institutional tranche of Wanadoo 's initial public offering has been 16 times oversubscribed and the retail tranche more than 4.5 times oversubscribed, said a source close to the float. Demand for the institutional tranche came 40% from France, 40% from other European countries and 20% from the United States and the rest of the world. France Telecom, Wanadoo's parent, declined to comment. \u0095 Expanding The American business-to-business marketplace company, Internet Capital Group, said it would expand its European holdings and has plans for a future spinoff. ICG also said it had appointed Doug Alexander, ICG's managing director and chairman of VerticalNet, as chief executive officer of ICG Europe. The company is planning to open an office in Paris and expand its Munich offices. \u0095 Developing Internet content software developer NetCentric Systems said it will raise \u00a3390,000 from a private placing to finance expansion plans. The cash will also be used to invest in development of the company's flagship technology, Lychee. The technology enables corporate website owners to update their websites by using a browser, eliminating the need for technical knowledge of complex web languages such as HTML.",

The ICM survey was taken at the weekend before the leak of Tony Blair's own confidential memo admitting that his government was widely perceived to be \"somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\" on key populist issues such as crime and asylum seekers. The leak was the subject of a high-level inquiry by the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, last night amid Labour hints that it had been orchestrated by the Tories after someone, inside Downing Street or an outside hacker, had intercepted Mr Blair's private communications. The timing, on the eve of Gordon Brown's long-awaited unveiling of his \u00a340bn comprehensive spending review and today's bad crime figures, is damaging. The Guardian's ICM poll will also dampen Labour's confidence, although Blair aides remain adamant that they are already on course to bounce back from mid-term difficulties.

      "bodyText": "Men and women forced to labour for the Nazis during the second world war are expected to receive initial compensation payments before the end of this year, following the signing yesterday of an historic deal to compensate them for their suffering. The agreement to set up a fund of 10bn marks (\u00a33.3bn) for former forced and slave labourers will almost certainly be Germany's last formal reparation for the horrors inflicted on Europe under Hitler's rule. Up to 10m men and women were used as labourers by the Third Reich. Yesterday's long-delayed settlement was greeted with contradictory sentiments by the victims - the satisfaction of some contrasting with the disillusion of others. Almost a fifth of the fund will cover property losses and projects connected with reparation. The remainder will be disbursed among more than half a million survivors. Slave labourers - most of them Jews were were intended to be worked to death - will get up to 15,000 marks. Forced labourers - mainly east Europeans -will receive about 5,000 marks. Dissatisfaction was most notable yesterday among representatives of the east European victims. Markiyan Demidov, head of the Ukrainian victims' union said: \"The amounts are a joke, an insult from Ger many.\" His Polish counterpart, Marian Nawrocki, said: \"This is not so much, considering the scale of our suffering, the bestial treatment we were subjected to and the wounds that stayed for life.\" But Ben Helfgott of Britain, who was born a Polish Jew and toiled in a string of labour camps, said: \"We have achieved something that we never thought would ever be possible.\" The deal was welcomed by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany.

Mohammed Hasan, the Taliban's Kandahar governor and one of the regime's most senior leaders, admitted the police had over-reacted. \"They were our guests and should not be treated like this,\" he said.

Analysts have estimated those five operators might have to spend a further \u00a310bn upgrading their networks to deliver the technology. The survey of 300 business users in Britain, the Netherlands and Germany found many mobile were dissatisfied with the performance of functions on their present handsets such as email and internet access. \"[They] aren't yet attractive enough for business managers to want to pay extra to upgrade their mobile phones,\" the survey concluded. \"Surprisingly, 28% expect their service provider to provide the upgrade for nothing. This is bad news for the network providers as it looks as if customers are not yet prepared to help them recoup their costs.\" The survey also found only 11% of those interviewed were happy with their current mobile phone operators and only 10% owned handsets capable of sending and receiving emails. Even so, more than two-thirds of those respondents expect to be using their mobile phones for email by 2003.",

Police said they were keeping an open mind as to whether the body was that of the missing schoolgirl until formal identification had taken place, but were unaware of any other missing girls from the area whom it could be. The discovery, 17 days after Sarah went missing from a country lane in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex, was made by a young farmworker as he walked in a field alongside the A29 between Pulborough and Billingshurst. Assistant Chief Constable Nigel Yeo, of Sussex police, said that a Home Office pathologist was at the scene examining the body, which was found 25 yards from a hedge separating the field from the busy main road which runs north through the West Sussex countryside from the coast. The body was believed to have lain undiscovered for some time, hidden from the main road by 6ft high ferns and dense undergrowth. Mr Yeo said parts of the body were covered up, including the face. \"There is some concealment.

Investigations were still focusing on the white van seen by Sarah's brothers in a lane near Kingston Gorse on July 1, at the time she vanished.

But the total for \"life threatening\" offences rose by 12% to 30,400. The upward increases in sex crimes (up 4%), racially aggravated offences - of which 22,000 were recorded - and domestic violence (not separately counted) are officially explained as reflecting a growing intolerance of such offences and a greater willingness to report them to the police. Drug offences fell by 10% to 122,000 offences, mainly possession. But it is the burglary and car crime figures which ministers will take the most comfort from. Burglaries fell for the seventh year running to 906,000 offences, and thefts of and from vehicles also fell for the seventh year running, by 3% on the previous year. But the continuing fall in detection rates, down from 29% to 25% will continue to cause anxiety. Officials said the fall was partly the result of tightening up the rules, so that offences cleared up during prison visits and those where no further action is taken were not counted as detections.",

      "body": "<b> TB's memo:</b> There are a clutch of issues - seemingly disparate - that are in fact linked. We need a strategy that is almost discrete, focussed (sic) on them. <p>Tony Blair fires off such memos to disparate groups of people at regular interviews. They are often staccato and dictatorial, and never complacent. \"He reads more like Thatcher than Major,\" says one cabinet source. \"He is intensely hands on and if he does not like the strategy on the health plan, for instance, he will say so.\" One cabinet minister said he recently received a memo setting out the prime minister's views on Hague's abandonment of the Tory tax guarantee, written within 48 hours of the Tory U-turn. The memos, sometimes dictated, often concentrate on trying to set new political dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives. </p> <p><b> TB</b> They are roughly combining \"on your side\" issues with toughness and standing up for Britain. </p> <p>This is drawn from the vocabulary of focus groups, largely conducted by Philip Gould, the party's obsessive pollster since 1985. Regarded with suspicion on the left and with reverence by party modernisers, Gould has a predilection for lists, pithy phrases and conjuring up new dividing lines. \"On your side issues\" may sound vacuous, but is intended to convey a government in touch with voters' instincts, needs and values. The phrase was originally developed in Mr Blair's first party conference speech as leader in 1994, when he told the country that Labour was \"on your side\" on education, crime and tax. Subsequently William Hague has used the same phrase in his speeches. </p> <p><b> TB </b> They range from: the family - where, partly due to MCA [married couple allowance] and gay issues, we are perceived as weak; asylum and crime, where we are perceived as soft; and asserting the nation's interests where, because of the unpopularity of Europe, a constant barrage of small stories beginning to add up on defence and even issues like Zimbabwe, we are seen as insufficiently assertive. </p> <p>The memo was written on the eve of the local goverment elections when Mr Blair had been receiving poll reports showing asylum pushing up the agenda. The married couple allowance had been scrapped in April 2000, saving the government \u00a32bn, but Mr Blair has been uneasy about the political signal the move sent out. The reference to gay issues confirms that he has been lukewarm about reforms such as the abolition of section 28, or the potentially far reaching review of the law on sexual offences. He was also struggling in his relations with Europe, where he did not want to be seen to be wielding the British veto, but also could not afford to be soft. Even a relatively obscure foreign policy issue - Zimbabwe and the treatment of white farmers - was related back to its impact on Labour's stance on defence. Many of the anxieties raised by Mr Blair in his memo, dated April 29, were later reflected back to him from a focus group conducted by Mr Gould on May 16 in the wake of the local elections and subsequently leaked to the Sunday Times. Mr Gould concluded: \"The basis of the Conservative recovery is concern over asylum seekers where the Conservatives are occupying the ground the electorate think we have vacated. We are believed to be soft on crime (and to) have lost our sense of mainstream values.\" </p> <p><b> TB </b> All this, of course, is perception. It is bizarre that any government I lead should be seen as anti-family. We are, in fact, taking very tough measures on asylum and crime. Kosovo should have laid to rest any doubts about our strength in defence. But all of these things add up to a sense that the government -and this even applies to me --are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts. </p> <p>Mr Blair always championed family values, even if some of his ministers, including Gordon Brown and Harriet Harman, were willing to send out warmer tax messages to less conventional families. Mr Blair assumed that his tough stance on Kosovo, the Gulf and Sierra Leone, would ensure his government would always be seen as sound on defence. References to himself reveal a presidential tone, but also some hurt at suggestions he would do anything to undermine the family. </p> <p><b> TB </b> The Martin case - and the lack of any response from us that appeared to empathise with public concern and then channel it into the correct course -has only heightened this problem. </p> <p>In a sign of his acute political antennae, Blair wrote this memo within three days of William Hague suddenly proposing that the balance of the law should be shifted to give greater protection to those defending their home or property. In public, the home secretary, Jack Straw, dismissed the Conservative scheme as a kneejerk reaction. However, by May 17, Mr Gould was privately writing to the prime minister warning that , judging from his focus group findings, \"neither the 'opportunism' or the 'extremism' attack worked ... Hague is speaking for the mainstream majority\". </p> <p><b> TB </b> Each of these issues should be analysed and the correct policy response drawn up. Then each should be dealt with, but with a message which ties it all together. This is precisely the sort of thing AC (Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's press secretary) and CF (Lord Charles Falconer, Cabinet Office minister) should do if a new system is put in place which frees up their time. </p> <p>The first definitive confirmation that Mr Blair had been intent for some time on releasing Mr Campbell from the time consuming lobby briefings to allow him space to think more strategically. There had been rumours that Mr Campbell felt his relations with the lobby had collapsed, or that he wanted to resign his post altogether. </p> <p><b> TB </b> My thoughts are: (i) Possibly on the Martin case, asking a senior judge to look at changing the sentencing law, ie to allow lesser sentences than life. We also need a far tougher rebuttal or alternatively action, re the allegations that jurors were intimidated. </p> <p>This does not tally with ministers' remarks. In the Commons on May 9, the Home Office minister, Charles Clarke, praised the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, for initially responding to the Martin case by saying 'I have yet to be persauded the law is at fault because the law says you can use reasonable force'. Mr Blair, by contrast, was considered asking a High Court judge to review the law. Later in the month, John Halliday, former Home Office director general of criminal justice policy, was asked to conduct a general review of sentencing policy, including repeat offending. The police examined but rejected allegations of juror tampering. </p> <p><b> TB </b> On asylum, we need to be highlighting removals and decisions plus if the April figures show a reduction, then a downward trend. If the benefits bill really starts to fall, that should be highlighted also. Plus some of the genuine asylum claims being given some publicity. </p> <p>Mr Blair was in luck. Asylum applications fell to 5,890 in April, a drop of nearly 800 on the previous year. Moreover, decisions processed in April rose to the second highest for 12 months. However, the asylum benefit bill is set to rise to \u00a3590m this year. The issue of desperate, if not necessarily genuine, asylum claims received tragic publicity with the death of over 50 migrants hidden in a lorry in Dover. </p> <p><b> TB </b> On crime, we need to highlight the tough measures: compulsory tests for drugs before bail; the PIU [performance innovation unit] report on the confiscation of assets; the extra number of burglars jailed under the \"three strikes and you're out\". </p> <p>The performance and innovation unit report published a month ago proposing confiscation of assets from criminals was indeed given wide publicity. The 1997 Crime Sentences Act imposed minimum three year sentences for repeat burglars, but only came into force in December 1999, partly for fear it would flood overcrowded prisons. </p> <p><b> TB </b> Above all, we must deal now with street crime, especially in London. When the figures are published for the six months to April, they will show a small -4% -rise in crime. But this will almost certainly be due to the rise in levels of street crime. This will be worst in London. The Met police are putting in place measures to deal with it; but, as ever, we are lacking a tough public message along with the strategy. </p> <p>A not very implicit criticism of Jack Straw who has faced Tory attacks for the decline in police numbers, the rise in violent crime and early release of 21,000 prioners on home curfew scheme. In May Mr Straw predicted 13,000 police would be recruited over the next two years. On June 15 he gave an extra \u00a315m to rural crime and a further \u00a320m to combat burglary in inner city areas. On June 23 he increased the Met pay by a special \u00a33,300 and attacked the courts for not delivering sufficiently severe sentences for robbery. </p> <p><b> TB </b> We should think now of an initiative, eg locking up street muggers. Something tough, with immediate bite which sends a message through the system. Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders. But this should be done soon and I, personally, should be associated with it. </p> <p>This suggests muddled thinking since the courts already have powers to remove driving licences. It led probably to Mr Blair's doomed proposal that drunken louts should be dragged to cash machines for on the spot fines. It was later hastily diluted into fixed penalty notices. Mr Blair personally associated himself with this daft, eye catching initiative. </p> <p><b> TB </b> On defence, we need to make the CSR [comprehensive spending review] work for defence. Big cuts and you can forget any hope of winning back ground on \"standing up for Britain\". </p> <p>This suggests Mr Blair feared the chancellor was prowling round the Ministry of Defence looking for spending cuts. The chief of defence staff, Sir Charles Guthrie, was allowed a symbolic victory over Mr Brown at a meeting on Friday. </p> <p><b> TB </b> On the family, we need two or three eye catching initiatives that are entirely conventional in terms of their attitude to the family. Despite the rubbish about gay couples, the adoption issue worked well. We need more. I should be personally associated with as much of this as possible. </p> <p>The volatile Sunday lobby were briefed on the adoption initiative, but the Sunday Times ran the story as a go-ahead for gay couples. Little else has happened on the family policy front, save the arrival of Mr Blair's youngest son, baby Leo, and the drunken night out of his eldest son, Euan. </p> <p>The prime minister's apparent preoccuupation with image and message should be set against constant reminders from his focus group guru, Philip Gould that he personally has to be in the front line. In his book Mr Gould writes: \"In a world of exploding media opportunity, you are either flying or dying.\" Mr Gould argues that Labour as incumbents must still send out clear, symbolic messages. Brilliant media relations are not an appendage to good government: they are essential to it. \"Unless you handle the media well, you cannot govern competently.\"</p>",

Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders. But this should be done soon and I, personally, should be associated with it. This suggests muddled thinking since the courts already have powers to remove driving licences. It led probably to Mr Blair's doomed proposal that drunken louts should be dragged to cash machines for on the spot fines. It was later hastily diluted into fixed penalty notices. Mr Blair personally associated himself with this daft, eye catching initiative. TB On defence, we need to make the CSR [comprehensive spending review] work for defence. Big cuts and you can forget any hope of winning back ground on \"standing up for Britain\". This suggests Mr Blair feared the chancellor was prowling round the Ministry of Defence looking for spending cuts. The chief of defence staff, Sir Charles Guthrie, was allowed a symbolic victory over Mr Brown at a meeting on Friday. TB On the family, we need two or three eye catching initiatives that are entirely conventional in terms of their attitude to the family. Despite the rubbish about gay couples, the adoption issue worked well. We need more. I should be personally associated with as much of this as possible. The volatile Sunday lobby were briefed on the adoption initiative, but the Sunday Times ran the story as a go-ahead for gay couples. Little else has happened on the family policy front, save the arrival of Mr Blair's youngest son, baby Leo, and the drunken night out of his eldest son, Euan. The prime minister's apparent preoccuupation with image and message should be set against constant reminders from his focus group guru, Philip Gould that he personally has to be in the front line. In his book Mr Gould writes: \"In a world of exploding media opportunity, you are either flying or dying.\" Mr Gould argues that Labour as incumbents must still send out clear, symbolic messages. Brilliant media relations are not an appendage to good government: they are essential to it. \"Unless you handle the media well, you cannot govern competently.\"",

They said the number of reported cases may in fact be rising at between 20% and 30% a year despite the apparently varied annual death rates over the past five years. The prediction came as it was revealed that the death toll from the incurable condition officially known as vCJD had risen by a further two in the past fortnight to a total of 69, and 14 so far this year. The scientists said that there was now a \"statistically significant rising trend\" in the number of victims since the first casualties first displayed signs of the disease in 1994, although it was still too early to forecast the ultimate number of deaths caused by vCJD. This year's toll is already equal to that for the whole of last year when the number dropped. A further seven people still alive are thought to be suffering from the condition. The scientists have come to their conclusion about the progress of the disease after analyses of monthly figures, including studying the dates at which friends, relatives or doctors first noted symptoms. The period between this and eventual death has varied between seven and 38 months, with an average of 14 months, although the incubation period before symptoms become evident is believed to be several years longer. Stephen Churchill was the first known death from the disease in May 1995, although it was not formally identified or officially linked to the eating of beef in the late 1980s until March 1996. Three people died in 1995, 10 in 1996, 10 in 1997, 18 in 1998 and 14 last year. Members of the government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee took the unusual step of publishing the figure immediately after their meeting in London yesterday because of the recent interest in a cluster of five cases around Queniborough in Leicestershire. These included three victims dying within a few of months in 1998, a fourth who died in May and another patient, still alive, who is thought to be suffering from the same disease. The scientists said this was \"unlikely to have occurred by chance but this cannot be completely ruled out\" and they would be closely informed about local investigations. The Department of Health last night said it could not elaborate on the significance of the new analysis until ministers and officials had considered the scientists' new advice. The figures came amid reports that sheep imported by the US from Europe were showing signs of a disease which could be linked to BSE in cattle.

Secret meetings on Saturday were organised with senior journalists on the Sun and the Times to give the two Rupert Murdoch newspapers most of the weekend to prepare the bombshells that rocked Downing Street yesterday. Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun's political editor, gave up the golf course to drive from his Epsom, Surrey home to London for a meeting. Andrew Pierce, an assistant editor on the Times, caught a cab to get across the capital for his separate meeting. The mole, who first made contact around Thursday last week, was \"known\" to both and told each that the other was also on the delivery list. Faxed copies of the letter were handed over, though it is unknown whether it was by the mole or a go-between. Some in the Labour party last night pointed the finger at the Tories, who - while delighted at the chaos - denied any involvement. No money changed hands, a senior figure at News International, which owns the papers, maintained. One Wapping executive closely involved in publication said: \"The motive was clearly to harm Blair.

      "body": "<p>They call Anna Wintour \"Nuclear Wintour\", and judging from the profile of her in Boss Women (BBC1), she could easily slaughter everything within a thousand-yard radius. Tight-lipped, stick thin, bereft of anything resembling charm and more ferociously driven than Josef Stalin, Wintour controls her empire at American Vogue through a combination of fear and ruthless efficiency. </p> <p>Still, you have to give her credit for a single-minded commitment that could bore through armour plate. Wintour has decided that Vogue, and the awesome influence it gives her, is her life. Although she has two children aged 12 and 14, it was difficult to work out when she sees them, since she gets up at 5.45am to play tennis and get her hair and make-up done in time to reach her office by 8am. After a hard day of ringing the opening bell on Wall Street, putting Hillary Clinton on the cover and shaping fashion's next wave, she's in bed by 10.30. Alone, as far as anyone knows. </p> <p>And here was the problem. Nobody knows anything about Wintour's private life and inner thought-processes, and by the end of the film they still didn't. Her feature writer, the delightfully dizzy Plum Sykes, described with gurgling adulation her boss's mastery of the media, giving interviews but controlling the process so thoroughly that she gives nothing away. This was illustrated at some length. </p> <p>It was Wintour's elusiveness that left the strongest impression. We saw her hosting a Vogue party surrounded by Liz Hurley, Iman and Lauren Hutton, but as Puff Daddy arrived, Wintour left, since she never stays at parties for longer than 20 minutes. She keeps editorial meetings to a crisp 15 minutes, commenting that \"even if I don't know what the hell I'm doing, I try to be decisive\".

      "bodyText": "They call Anna Wintour \"Nuclear Wintour\", and judging from the profile of her in Boss Women (BBC1), she could easily slaughter everything within a thousand-yard radius. Tight-lipped, stick thin, bereft of anything resembling charm and more ferociously driven than Josef Stalin, Wintour controls her empire at American Vogue through a combination of fear and ruthless efficiency. Still, you have to give her credit for a single-minded commitment that could bore through armour plate. Wintour has decided that Vogue, and the awesome influence it gives her, is her life. Although she has two children aged 12 and 14, it was difficult to work out when she sees them, since she gets up at 5.45am to play tennis and get her hair and make-up done in time to reach her office by 8am. After a hard day of ringing the opening bell on Wall Street, putting Hillary Clinton on the cover and shaping fashion's next wave, she's in bed by 10.30. Alone, as far as anyone knows. And here was the problem. Nobody knows anything about Wintour's private life and inner thought-processes, and by the end of the film they still didn't. Her feature writer, the delightfully dizzy Plum Sykes, described with gurgling adulation her boss's mastery of the media, giving interviews but controlling the process so thoroughly that she gives nothing away. This was illustrated at some length. It was Wintour's elusiveness that left the strongest impression. We saw her hosting a Vogue party surrounded by Liz Hurley, Iman and Lauren Hutton, but as Puff Daddy arrived, Wintour left, since she never stays at parties for longer than 20 minutes. She keeps editorial meetings to a crisp 15 minutes, commenting that \"even if I don't know what the hell I'm doing, I try to be decisive\". She makes Margaret Thatcher seem timid and wishy-washy. In 100 Per Cent White (Channel 4), Leo Regan revisited three of the neo-Nazis he wrote a book about 10 years ago, and made you wonder how he could bear to spend so much time with these depressing, screwed-up losers.

The prime minister was at Chequers, read his Saturday newspaper clippings - including the day's editorial in the Daily Mail - and dashed off a memo to his inner circle.</p> <p>BBC2 viewers who watched Michael Cockerell's Downing Street documentary last Saturday will recognise how it works: first name terms, rapid reaction to breaking news, awareness of the need to get the government's \"message\" across.</p> <p>Mr Blair is famously sensitive to the Daily Mail as a voice of middle England. On April 29, under the headline The shadow of a new intolerance, the paper accused him of trying to dismiss his critics as \"antediluvian reactionaries\" and homophobic bigots.</p> <p>Contrary to some speculation yesterday, Mr Blair did not knock out an email, complete with colloquialisms and a spelling error (\"focussed\" with a double s).

      "bodyText": "There is a distinctly Blairite air of informality to the leaked memo. The prime minister was at Chequers, read his Saturday newspaper clippings - including the day's editorial in the Daily Mail - and dashed off a memo to his inner circle. BBC2 viewers who watched Michael Cockerell's Downing Street documentary last Saturday will recognise how it works: first name terms, rapid reaction to breaking news, awareness of the need to get the government's \"message\" across. Mr Blair is famously sensitive to the Daily Mail as a voice of middle England. On April 29, under the headline The shadow of a new intolerance, the paper accused him of trying to dismiss his critics as \"antediluvian reactionaries\" and homophobic bigots. Contrary to some speculation yesterday, Mr Blair did not knock out an email, complete with colloquialisms and a spelling error (\"focussed\" with a double s). He hand-wrote a memo which was typed and almost certainly faxed to his intimates. The loyalty of its recipients is beyond question: almost certainly chief of staff, Jonathan Powell; press secretary, Alastair Campbell; David Milliband, head of the policy unit; and Cabinet Office ministers Mo Mowlam and Lord Falconer QC. Downing Street yesterday stressed that Mr Blair sends many such memos, and only this weekend scribbled notes on the transport plan, on today's comprehensive spending review, and on the NHS reforms. For Labour's critics the memo appears to show Mr Blair as a media-obsessed lightweight - exactly as William Hague is keen to show him. That is one aspect of the truth. New Labour is image-conscious and right to be so. In some ways the memo shows Mr Blair to be on the ball, keen to show he is in charge and in touch - not indifferent to \"gut British instincts\". We have seen him acting upon that notion in the intervening weeks - with mixed results.",

Or, to be more exact, kicked him behind the knee. Harris, asked to justify his behaviour, boasted \"he limped through the rest of the game\".

It was a fitting speech, as this concert couldn't have taken place without Glock, credited with introducing early music to the Proms. Once, it would have been unthinkable to put on a period-instrument concert in the Albert Hall of works by just one composer - but times change. </p> <p>One of the ensembles that have brought about that change is the English Baroque Soloists, a group that, at its best, can make the listener wonder why anyone ever thought of modernising orchestral instruments. For them, and for the Monteverdi Choir, this was another step of Gardiner's massive Bach Cantata Pilgrimage project, which will see all 198 of Bach's sacred cantatas performed worldwide. </p> <p>Cantatas number 24 and 185 were being crossed off the list on this occasion, framed by two instrumental works - the Fourth Suite and the First Brandenburg Concerto - and dwarfed by the D Major Magnificat with which the concert closed. The precise, disciplined choir sang for the most part with clarity, but tenor Paul Agnew tended to overdo the phrasing in his arias, meaning that some of his notes disappeared into the vast enclosure of thin air above the platform. He was nonetheless a communicative soloist, as was Magdalena Kozena, his duet partner in Cantata 185, whose bright mezzo-soprano rang easily out over the orchestra. </p> <p>Yet despite the presence of three other promising young soloists - soprano Miah Persson, contralto Nathalie Stutzmann and full-bodied bass Nicolas Test\u00e9 - it was the orchestra's night. The obbligato soloists in the arias of the Magnificat assumed as much importance as their vocal counterparts. Xenia Loffler's oboe d'amore solo in the Quia respexit was beautifully warm, inspiring Persson to relish each word she sang. </p> <p>Each movement brought another finely coloured accompaniment - the flute duet in Esurientes, the feather bed of muted strings in Et misericordia. The entire violin section stood as Agnew sang Deposuit potentes, playing with soloistic flourish and a fierce attack on every note. Cutting through the texture were the three excellent brass players, who made trills on the natural trumpet seem easy (they're not). For a thrilling sound, only the heroic crescendo from the basses in the choir in the closing bars of the Magnificat came even close.</p> <p>\u0095 Erica Jeal</p> <p>It's extraordinary that Mendelssohn's oratorio St Paul has had to wait until the cusp of the third millennium for its first Proms performance. St Paul is precisely the kind of rousing-but-reverent choral spectacular that has historically been at the core of Proms programming. Yet the piece is almost completely neglected in this country in favour of Mendelssohn's other oratorio, Elijah. The performance by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Richard Hickox, who is shortly to become their principal conductor, was an evangelical attempt to kick-start the popularity of St Paul - even if a thinly attended Royal Albert Hall pointed to an uphill struggle. </p> <p>Hickox eschewed any notions of historical correctness. This was a grand account, situated firmly in the tradition of massed choirs and the British lineage of choral conducting at the Proms. At the heart of the performance was a superabundant chorus, an exotic combination of the BBC National Chorus of Wales, the London Symphony Chorus and the Houston Symphony Chorus. They achieved a remarkable clarity and focus - as well as brute power - in the unrelenting counterpoint of Mendelssohn's choral writing. </p> <p>The problems with St Paul are to do with its narrative. Part I tells the dramatic story of Saul's conversion. Mendelssohn depicts the moment of divine intervention with extrovert orchestral colour, in an enormous crescendo before a blazing choral entry. But in the second half, St Paul's preaching and martyrdom present fewer opportunities for vivid illustration. Instead, Mendelssohn's music is more like a series of attractive, but static, tableaux. </p> <p>However, Hickox's conducting never let the music subside into laborious penance. In fact, combined with the eloquent St Paul of Peter Coleman-Wright, the enthusiasm of tenor Robert Tear - a luxurious last-minute replacement for John Mark Ainsley - and the expressive range of soprano Susan Gritton, this St Paul was a fervent, inspiring pilgrimage.</p> <p>\u0095 Tom Service</p>",

Cutting through the texture were the three excellent brass players, who made trills on the natural trumpet seem easy (they're not). For a thrilling sound, only the heroic crescendo from the basses in the choir in the closing bars of the Magnificat came even close. \u0095 Erica Jeal It's extraordinary that Mendelssohn's oratorio St Paul has had to wait until the cusp of the third millennium for its first Proms performance. St Paul is precisely the kind of rousing-but-reverent choral spectacular that has historically been at the core of Proms programming. Yet the piece is almost completely neglected in this country in favour of Mendelssohn's other oratorio, Elijah. The performance by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Richard Hickox, who is shortly to become their principal conductor, was an evangelical attempt to kick-start the popularity of St Paul - even if a thinly attended Royal Albert Hall pointed to an uphill struggle. Hickox eschewed any notions of historical correctness. This was a grand account, situated firmly in the tradition of massed choirs and the British lineage of choral conducting at the Proms. At the heart of the performance was a superabundant chorus, an exotic combination of the BBC National Chorus of Wales, the London Symphony Chorus and the Houston Symphony Chorus. They achieved a remarkable clarity and focus - as well as brute power - in the unrelenting counterpoint of Mendelssohn's choral writing. The problems with St Paul are to do with its narrative. Part I tells the dramatic story of Saul's conversion. Mendelssohn depicts the moment of divine intervention with extrovert orchestral colour, in an enormous crescendo before a blazing choral entry. But in the second half, St Paul's preaching and martyrdom present fewer opportunities for vivid illustration. Instead, Mendelssohn's music is more like a series of attractive, but static, tableaux. However, Hickox's conducting never let the music subside into laborious penance. In fact, combined with the eloquent St Paul of Peter Coleman-Wright, the enthusiasm of tenor Robert Tear - a luxurious last-minute replacement for John Mark Ainsley - and the expressive range of soprano Susan Gritton, this St Paul was a fervent, inspiring pilgrimage. \u0095 Tom Service",

      "body": "<p>Force Fields: Phases of the Kinetic is a strange exhibition. Now at the Hayward Gallery, London, having travelled from the Museum of Contemporary Art (Macba) in Barcelona, Force Fields comes on the heels of Sonic Boom, one of the Hayward's dreariest ever exhibitions. The two shows have something in common, in their attention to works which twang, boing, whoop and dazzle with pretty coloured lights. But Sonic Boom was merely modish, where Force Fields attempts to trace a path through history. </p> <p>Curated by Guy Brett, whose interest in things kinetic is matched only by his championing of art from Latin and South America, the exhibition is fascinating, disparate, and, at times oddly affecting. It also presents us with kinetic art as an expanded field, an open terrain, rather than anything we can call a consolidated movement. </p> <p>Brett's show seems to me to be brave. In part, this is due to the inclusion of artists one would not necessarily associate with the \"kinetic\", whatever that is. One expects Takis , Marcel Duchamp, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, whose mechanical sculptures and objects are canonical objects of kinetic art. But not necessarily the great Lygia Clark, although her sculptures and objects require interaction and manipulation, or Maria Schendel's ropes and worm-casts of rolled and knotted rice-paper, or Agnes Denes's peculiar ink drawing of tiny human figures, in a snail-like vortex. I'd never have thought, either, that the work of Robert Smithson or Gordon Matta-Clark had much in common with Pol Bury's furtive, twitching nests of nylon fishing line, or Jean Tinguely's absurd clattering machines, but of course there is a link, even if it is more to do with the artist's sense of the mutability of the world than anything else. </p> <p>The artist Wols was, towards the end of his life, almost entirely immobilised. Confined to his bed in Paris in the early 50s, he drew mad, obsessive little drawings, spidery networks of lines, horrifying exploding testicle shapes, intricate wounds - all visions of his own decay. Henri Michaux (whose resuscitation is also in part due to a renewed interest in the informalist and tachist artists of the 40s and 50s) is included with a number of his seismic, automatist, mescaline drawings. With their seizures and repetitions, their fields of psychic tremors, one wonders what was due to his quaking hand, what to his juddering brain. </p> <p>Wols, Michaux and Georges Vantongerloo - who made crazily cosmological drawings, as well as odd, jewellery-like sculptures and paintings (looking back to theosophist drawings of psychic auras at the beginning of the 20th century) - are artists for whom movement is a matter of the firing of the brain's synapses, of involuntary palpitations and convulsions. Their visions may have more to do with Einsteinian relativism rather than Newton's mechanical laws of the universe. Equally, they were driven by some apprehension of the inherent instability of the world, of their own imminent collapse, and temporary confusions between inner and external experience. We may all have such moments of madness, but they were able to keep a grip on that part of themselves which could record their subjective crises. What we might call their kinaesthesia is as much the subject of the show as is the mechanical. </p> <p>Although the exhibition begins, historically, with the optical experiments of Duchamp and Man Ray of the 20s, and the shimmering, rota-ting mechanical apparatus of Moholy-Nagy, it may as well have begun with cubism's essentially kinetic idea of the world fragmenting into multiple simultaneous viewpoints. Cubism, futurism and vorticism represent art's early attempts to come to terms with the 20th century - that is, with the advances of Freudianism and theoretical physics as much as the machine age itself. We are still trying to do much the same thing, and while Brett alludes to very recent art, the exhibition does not take on board the electronic revolution of the past 20 years. That, though, is probably for another show - of art anxious about its disappearance, suspicious of technology (yet always willing to use it), apocalyptic in its study of the effects of new technology on human consciousness. </p> <p>In the small film section of this show, curated by Mark Nash, the revelations, for me, are the two hand-drawn animations by the American James Whitney. Whitney, who died in 1982, drew the most astonishing abstract animated films. Brownian-motion fields of corpuscular dots slew into tantric mandalas and rhythmic ejaculations of shooting stars - vertiginous free-falls of writhing squiggles. Not surprisingly, Whitney hung out with Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood, and lived in California. Uncharitably, one might view his films as pre-computer screen-savers, or pre cursors to Timothy Leary and horrible psychedelic album covers, yet their effects are all the more compelling for their alarming hand-drawn intensity. And anyhow, there is something redeemable, even in the so-called psychedelic. </p> <p>Brett says in his introduction to the show that he would have liked to present these works \"without interpretive text or didactic material\". He doesn't, of course, and the catalogue goes a long way towards locating and drawing parallels between more than 40 artists, who occupy different historical, geographic and aesthetic positions and moments. Cosmological fantasists and conceptualists, taoists and phenomenologists, mescaline-eaters and alcoholics, a Benedictine monk who updated the illuminated manuscript and recast it as concrete poetry all find a home here. </p> <p> Brett's proposed silence is a good place to start. But it is a silence already loud with clatterings, screeches, metal machine music. Things twitch, vibrate, attract and repel one another. The minimal glass cube weeps and drizzles inside, as though the weather had leaked in. Waves flow along a ruffling length of white cotton, driven by the wind of an electric fan. A white, helium-filled balloon, which should stay suspended above a jet of air drifted away, as though it had lost concentration. It is a silence, too, in which I hear the lines, \"Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel, like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind\", going round in my head.

      "bodyText": "Force Fields: Phases of the Kinetic is a strange exhibition. Now at the Hayward Gallery, London, having travelled from the Museum of Contemporary Art (Macba) in Barcelona, Force Fields comes on the heels of Sonic Boom, one of the Hayward's dreariest ever exhibitions. The two shows have something in common, in their attention to works which twang, boing, whoop and dazzle with pretty coloured lights. But Sonic Boom was merely modish, where Force Fields attempts to trace a path through history. Curated by Guy Brett, whose interest in things kinetic is matched only by his championing of art from Latin and South America, the exhibition is fascinating, disparate, and, at times oddly affecting. It also presents us with kinetic art as an expanded field, an open terrain, rather than anything we can call a consolidated movement. Brett's show seems to me to be brave. In part, this is due to the inclusion of artists one would not necessarily associate with the \"kinetic\", whatever that is. One expects Takis , Marcel Duchamp, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, whose mechanical sculptures and objects are canonical objects of kinetic art. But not necessarily the great Lygia Clark, although her sculptures and objects require interaction and manipulation, or Maria Schendel's ropes and worm-casts of rolled and knotted rice-paper, or Agnes Denes's peculiar ink drawing of tiny human figures, in a snail-like vortex. I'd never have thought, either, that the work of Robert Smithson or Gordon Matta-Clark had much in common with Pol Bury's furtive, twitching nests of nylon fishing line, or Jean Tinguely's absurd clattering machines, but of course there is a link, even if it is more to do with the artist's sense of the mutability of the world than anything else. The artist Wols was, towards the end of his life, almost entirely immobilised. Confined to his bed in Paris in the early 50s, he drew mad, obsessive little drawings, spidery networks of lines, horrifying exploding testicle shapes, intricate wounds - all visions of his own decay. Henri Michaux (whose resuscitation is also in part due to a renewed interest in the informalist and tachist artists of the 40s and 50s) is included with a number of his seismic, automatist, mescaline drawings. With their seizures and repetitions, their fields of psychic tremors, one wonders what was due to his quaking hand, what to his juddering brain. Wols, Michaux and Georges Vantongerloo - who made crazily cosmological drawings, as well as odd, jewellery-like sculptures and paintings (looking back to theosophist drawings of psychic auras at the beginning of the 20th century) - are artists for whom movement is a matter of the firing of the brain's synapses, of involuntary palpitations and convulsions. Their visions may have more to do with Einsteinian relativism rather than Newton's mechanical laws of the universe. Equally, they were driven by some apprehension of the inherent instability of the world, of their own imminent collapse, and temporary confusions between inner and external experience. We may all have such moments of madness, but they were able to keep a grip on that part of themselves which could record their subjective crises. What we might call their kinaesthesia is as much the subject of the show as is the mechanical. Although the exhibition begins, historically, with the optical experiments of Duchamp and Man Ray of the 20s, and the shimmering, rota-ting mechanical apparatus of Moholy-Nagy, it may as well have begun with cubism's essentially kinetic idea of the world fragmenting into multiple simultaneous viewpoints. Cubism, futurism and vorticism represent art's early attempts to come to terms with the 20th century - that is, with the advances of Freudianism and theoretical physics as much as the machine age itself. We are still trying to do much the same thing, and while Brett alludes to very recent art, the exhibition does not take on board the electronic revolution of the past 20 years. That, though, is probably for another show - of art anxious about its disappearance, suspicious of technology (yet always willing to use it), apocalyptic in its study of the effects of new technology on human consciousness. In the small film section of this show, curated by Mark Nash, the revelations, for me, are the two hand-drawn animations by the American James Whitney. Whitney, who died in 1982, drew the most astonishing abstract animated films. Brownian-motion fields of corpuscular dots slew into tantric mandalas and rhythmic ejaculations of shooting stars - vertiginous free-falls of writhing squiggles. Not surprisingly, Whitney hung out with Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood, and lived in California. Uncharitably, one might view his films as pre-computer screen-savers, or pre cursors to Timothy Leary and horrible psychedelic album covers, yet their effects are all the more compelling for their alarming hand-drawn intensity. And anyhow, there is something redeemable, even in the so-called psychedelic. Brett says in his introduction to the show that he would have liked to present these works \"without interpretive text or didactic material\". He doesn't, of course, and the catalogue goes a long way towards locating and drawing parallels between more than 40 artists, who occupy different historical, geographic and aesthetic positions and moments. Cosmological fantasists and conceptualists, taoists and phenomenologists, mescaline-eaters and alcoholics, a Benedictine monk who updated the illuminated manuscript and recast it as concrete poetry all find a home here. Brett's proposed silence is a good place to start. But it is a silence already loud with clatterings, screeches, metal machine music. Things twitch, vibrate, attract and repel one another. The minimal glass cube weeps and drizzles inside, as though the weather had leaked in. Waves flow along a ruffling length of white cotton, driven by the wind of an electric fan. A white, helium-filled balloon, which should stay suspended above a jet of air drifted away, as though it had lost concentration. It is a silence, too, in which I hear the lines, \"Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel, like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind\", going round in my head. I wish it would stop. Standing on one of the Hayward's open-air decks, watching the shredded clouds of detergent bubbles spew from David Medalla's Cloud Gates, that awful song came back to me, along with Little Fluffy Clouds, by the Orb. Hell, why not? It is nice to stand here and watch the soapy blobs bounce into people as they drift down, to see people on the street pause and look up for a moment. Force Fields made me think, and to confront certain of my own prejudices, for which I am grateful. It was also, on the first day the show was open to the public, almost empty. Most London galleries are suffering a lowering of attendance figures at present, because everyone is at Tate Modern. But numbers aren't everything.

These days, airborne Britishers are more likely to be complaining about lack of leg-room than instigating bedroom scenes, while stewardesses are too busy maintaining order on zoo-like planes to entertain amorous advances. But, as deglamourised as the air hostess has become in the easyJet era, she is still a key feminine icon. Almost every little girl has dreamed of wearing that chic uniform (or its modern polyester equivalent), and though the mystique may have tarnished, it has never quite faded. This week, BBC2's new series on the changing status of women, The Lipstick Years, kicks off with the documentary Fly Me, which traces the profession through its many permutations, from the 30s (when the job included fuelling the plane) to the age of Ibiza charter flights.</p> <p>Being an air hostess has always been \"top of the female fantasy league\", in presenter Lowri Turner's words. But the downsides are enough to put off all but the most determined. The job is a peculiar combination of servility and power, with women rigorously trained in health and safety, yet relegated to serving meals. They're expected to tolerate rude and boorish passengers without complaint, and attempts to respond in kind result in reprimands. Worse, the uniform makes them fair game for some men. \"Uniforms are sexy. The British Airways uniform is quite militaristic, like the RAF,\" says Philip Kerr, an ex-advertising copywriter who worked on a BA campaign. \"Some airlines create images that lend themselves to the idea of mid-air shagging.\"</p> <p>In the 60s, airlines woke up to the fact that hostesses could be employed as bait to attract their core passenger, the travelling businessman. Fly Me (which is named after an infamous advertising slogan, \"I'm Mandy, Fly Me\") has fascinating archive footage of ads that stopped just short of pimping. A TWA commercial shows a minxy young thing blowing the froth off a pint of beer as a male voice intones: \"We have old English pub flights, complete with serving wench.\" Eastern Airlines' ad boasts that they don't hire girls who wear glasses.</p> <p>Moreover, the girls who made the grade had to be under 32, unmarried and were subjected to compulsory public weigh-ins, where an extra pound meant suspension without pay.</p> <p>\"They made me turn around and looked at me,\" recalls Isabel McIlwraith, who flew for BOAC between 1966 and 1974. \"At my [job] interview, I'd just been nursing in Beirut, and the first question they asked was, 'Why is it so many girls come back from Beirut pregnant?' What can you say? I think I said 'Because they can't resist the attention of Arab men'. I answered all their questions. I didn't care, because I was 22 and reasonably attractive, and it was so exciting.\"</p> <p>The Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 did away with the under-32 rule, and sleazy advertising was gradually replaced by campaigns emphasising safety and reliability. But the hostess's job hasn't changed all that much: it's still about cleaning up after 300 strangers a day in exchange for the chance to see the world. Yet women still queue to do it.</p> <p>\"When I was growing up,\" says Amanda Drake of United Airlines, \"it was either marry Donny Osmond or join an airline.

Customers don't get fresh - it's just groups of people out having a good time. I've certainly never been proposed to.\"</p> <p>I grew up in the 70s, when air travel was something you did once a year at most, and stewardesses still commanded envious respect. The job hadn't yet been debased by having to control lagered-up blokes flying to Barcelona for \u00a359 return. Air rage hadn't been invented, nor the concomitant attitude that flight attendants are acceptable vents for the stress of being cooped up for eight hours. When singer Ian Brown was convicted of threatening to cut a flight attendant's hands off in 1998, one of his band shrugged that she was \"just a flying dinner lady\".</p> <p>It makes you wonder why so many people still aspire to a job that former Debonair flight attendant Samantha Parker remembers as \"waitressing... and the smell of planes first thing in the morning\". Another ex-stewardess interviewed on Fly Me managed just 12 months in the air before quitting to become a lap dancer. \"You only earned \u00a310,500 a year plus allowance for up to a six- day week. Now I entertain on the ground,\" she says from her new job at Stringfellow's Cabaret of Angels.</p> <p>But Drake argues a persuasive case, maintaining that the modern flight attendant is less \"trolley dolly\" than valued professional in an industry geared towards \"the product, service and technology\". So does her colleague Loretta Burke, 78, the world's oldest working stewardess. Based in Washington, DC, she still does five overseas trips a month. \"Honey, I work my wrinkles to my advantage,\" she laughs. Quite so. Airlines should think about this: who inspires more confidence, an old hand like Burke or a 19-year-old hired for the size of her duty-frees? I know who I'd rather fly with.</p> <p>She managed to flout the rule about retiring at 32 - \"I guess they couldn't fire me because I was doing a pretty good job\" - but never married. \"Most of the girls only flew for two years, because the fantasy was that you'd marry a rich man. If you were flying for five years, you were an old maid.\"</p> <p>McIlwraith agrees. \"It was assumed that after 10 years you'd be worn out,\" she says. \"They wanted young, attractive girls. You had to be cheerful to cope with not just men but old ladies and mothers with children, which is very stressful. And everyone envied us and wanted to be us.\"</p> <p>That's still true now, to an extent. The lure of free travel and freedom from the nine-to-five grind attracts thousands of applicants. But much of the lustre has gone since the time of Baker and Jones (who apparently finally got their men and quit flying in the late 60s). Perspicacious airlines should be aware that the job is no longer top of the female fantasy league. \"You ask little girls what they want to be now,\" muses Turner, \"and they all say TV presenters.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Lipstick Years: Fly Me is on BBC2 on Wednesday at 9pm.</p>",

Mrs Fray said that her husband's recollection of the meeting, which lasted about an hour, was accurate. Mr McDonald said: \"I don't know what provoked it or what. I just remember that one little comment.\" Polls consistently show that Mr Lazio, a previously obscure congressman from Long Island, is neck-and-neck with Mrs Clinton. He entered the race in place of the much better known New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who withdrew because of health and marital problems. Mrs Clinton has already had trouble with the Jewish vote and was booed when she took part in an Israel Day parade in Manhattan. She was criticised last year during a visit to the West Bank for failing to rebuke Yasser Arafat's wife immediately for saying that Israel was poisoning Palestinian children. Instead, she and Suba Arafat exchanged kisses.",

He showed signs of achieving a similar level of success before a serious accident during the 1951 Mille Miglia - a race around a thousand miles of Italian public roads from Brescia to Rome and back again - inflicted injuries which ended his career in competition.</p> <p>He raced in only one Formula One world championship event, the Italian Grand Prix of 1950 at Monza. After 34 laps he obeyed a request to hand over his Ferrari to team leader Alberto Ascari, whose car had failed some minutes earlier. The combined efforts of the two men earned them a finish in second place, behind the Alfa Romeo of Dr Giuseppe Farina, whose victory also made him the first world champion.</p> <p>Teodoro Serafini was the oldest of the four sons of a carriage builder and beekeeper in San Pietro in Calibano, a village near Pesaro, on Italy's Adriatic coast. At that time the region between Pesaro and Modena was full of young men making machines with wheels and laying the foundations of the Italian motor industry. For many of them, racing was not just an enjoyable new sport but a way of proving the commercial value of their creations. Signor Serafini's passion for motorcycles was inherited by the young Dorino and further fuelled by the presence in Pesaro of the Benelli family. The five Benelli brothers - Tonino, Francesco, Giuseppe, Filippo and Mimo - were building formidable little 175cc bikes, which Tonino rode to a number of local victories.</p> <p>It was on a Benelli 175 that Serafini made his racing debut in the 1928 Circuit of Rimini, a few kilometres up the coast from his home, recording the fastest time. He stayed faithful to his hometown manufacturer for the next four years But it was on MM machines, built by the Bolognese firm of Morini and Massetti, that he became Italian national champion in the 175cc category, racing in a white sweater with the company's initials embroidered on its chest.</p> <p>In 1935 he moved up to the 500cc class, the motorcycling equivalent of Formula One, joining the Bianchi team, whose promotional department made the most of his victory in the Circuit of Lario by printing special literature to draw attention to the speed and efficiency of their machines - recognisable by the pale blue of their paintwork. In the saddle of Bianchi's freccia celeste (blue arrow), Serafini also won the 1936 Coppa Acerbo at Pescara and the 1937 Circuito del Giardini Margherita in Bologna.</p> <p>Such was his reputation that in 1938 the two most successful teams in Italy, Guzzi and Gilera, competed for his services, the latter making the winning bid with the offer of a salary of 2,000 lire a month.</p> <p>In his first season on the four-cylinder machines, Serafini's victories in the grands prix of Sweden, Germany and Ulster gave him the title of European champion ahead of his main rival, the BMW rider Georg Maier of Germany. At the victory ceremony after the race on the Saxtorp circuit in Malmo, he and the other class winners - two German riders on NSU and DKW machines - followed the contemporary custom of giving the fascist salute on the podium.</p> <p>After the war Serafini moved immediately to the world of four-wheeled racing, competing against Tazio Nuvolari and others in the elegant little Cisitalia single-seaters built in large numbers by Piero Dusio to help speed the rebirth of Italian motor sport, starting with a race in the park around the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. But Serafini also competed in a Frazer-Nash and a four-seater Healey 2000, with which he and Count Johnny Lurani took second place in the Tour of Sicily in 1948, as well as in the pretty little OSCA sports cars built by the Maserati brothers in Bologna.</p> <p>In 1949 and 1950 Serafini visited Argentina to participate in the Temporada series, driving for the Maserati and Ferrari factories and meeting President Juan Per\u00f3n and his wife Evita, who were great motor sport fans. In 1950, at the wheel of one of Enzo Ferrari's early single-seaters, he came second in the Gran Premio Maria Eva Duarte Peron on the Palermo Park circuit in Buenos Aires. On his return he and the other Italian drivers who had made the trip - among them Ascari, Farina, Gigi Villoresi and Piero Taruffi - were received by Pope Pius XII in a special audience.</p> <p>But Serafini's greatest result in a racing car was undoubtedly his second place in the 1950 Mille Miglia.That year it rained virtually throughout the race and Serafini got a 12-hour soaking in his little open Ferrari barchetta, finishing behind Giannino Marzotto in a closed Ferrari coup\u00e9.</p> <p>By this time he was also making regular appearances in Ferrari's Formula Two single-seaters, although his performances were usually overshadowed by those of his team mates, Ascari and Villoresi.

Over the years, however, the ultra-Orthodox rabbis have faced a growing challenge from the Reform and Masorti movements, which are beginning to gain popularity. Transported to Israel by English-speaking immigrants 30 years ago, the more liberal streams of Judaism are finding followers among Jews from the former Soviet Union and native-born Israelis, who are exposed to the movements on visits abroad. But liberal Judaism remains on the sidelines of Israeli life. Mainstream newspapers have given only glancing coverage to the attacks, reflecting the ambivalence even secular Israelis feel towards more liberal streams of Judaism. Such indifference dismays many American Jews, who mostly belong to Reform synagogues. \"In the US we are called the voice of diaspora Judaism. Here we are called heretics,\" said Chaim Lieberman, a performance poet from Florida who is studying for a master's degree in Jewish education at Hebrew Union College. \"It has me wondering whether the people I pass on the street with kipot [skullcaps] tilted a certain way are the individuals who smashed the windows of my college.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government is being urged to increase funding for training the next generation of actors and dancers - or suffer a disaster in the arts. A report published today by the National Council for Drama Training warned that a scholarship scheme introduced by the government was underfunded, limited in scope, and bureaucratic. Although welcoming the dance and drama awards, the report said the scheme failed to meet ministers' objectives of enabling the maximum number of talented students to attend the best schools. Winners of the awards get help with finding annual fees of up to \u00a39,000, paying at most \u00a31,050, in line with university students. In the wake of recent spectacular failures in football and tennis, the report's author, Graham Marchant, an independent arts consultant, warned: \"Britain is already seeing the results of failure to invest properly in training in sports activity; it would be a disaster if similar mistakes were made in one of the few other arenas where this country has an absolutely outstanding international reputation to defend.\" He also suggested that the awards scheme was elitist because it had created a divisive two tier structure which distinguished between separating \"talented\" students on the accredited courses who had won scholarships from those who had also won places but not scholarships. The report said that this implied that the latter were deemed \"untalented\". The call for more funds comes days after details emerged of a last minute tussle between the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the culture secretary, Chris Smith, over a \u00a360m rescue package to save up to 50 regional theatres from closure over the next three years. Mr Smith is said to be furious at having been put \"last in the queue\" for cash in today's spending review, because of the competing demands from big spending departments such as health, education and transport. The Marchant report also highlighted anomalies which resulted from courses being split between the further and higher education sectors, leaving FE students worse off as they were unable to apply for student loans to cover living costs. The government has increased the money from a special hardship fund to help students on FE courses - predominantly dancers. Yet many on these physically demanding courses are forced to take part-time jobs, which made them even more exhausted. Peter Cheeseman, chairman of the drama training council, acknowledged that introduction of the awards scheme was \"a great milestone in the history of our state funding for the arts\". But he added: \"By not investing properly in our young talent we are gradually diluting the source of great international triumphs and pride. Take the number of Oscars which Britain won for Shakespeare in Love. We must invest in the future, not the past, and the government should stop being so short sighted.\"",

Routine tests have found that nine miners at the Longannet colliery in Fife have developed pneumoconiosis, or black lung, which is caused by inhaling coal dust. A further 11 have abnormalities in the lungs, an early stage of the condition. The condition, which can lead to debilitating and sometimes fatal respiratory disease, was thought to have almost disappeared with the introduction of new safety and screening measures in the mid-1970s. Last year a compensation scheme was agreed for miners affected by the disease after the biggest ever personal injury action in the UK. A health and safety executive report on the Longannet findings is expected to blame excessive working hours and a failure to use protective equipment properly. Dan Mitchell, HSE chief inspector of mines, said it was unusual to have found such an outbreak. \"But certainly in recent years the number of workers in mines attending for x-ray has been falling,\" he said. \"It's not as good as it used to be and we only know about the prevalence of disease from the people who are x-rayed.\" The re-emergence of the disease has also surprised medical authorities at the Scottish pulmonary vascular unit at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. \"I am really quite surprised because we have known about this condition for years and screening measures have been in place for years,\" said the unit head, Andrew Peacock. \"We know what causes it.

They are also expected to have lung x-rays every five years, but at Longannet only around 70% of men took part on the last occasion.

His second sense relates to the world of birds and bees, the \"non-human world\". Odd behaviour there apparently justifies odd behaviour among humans on the basis that it is \"natural\".</p> <p>In order to appreciate what the Pope means when he describes homosexual behaviour as unnatural, \"contrary to the natural law\", you need to have another sense of the word nature, and be able to think beyond the empirical sciences. You need to understand function and purpose, and be able to situate individual human acts harmoniously in a network of relationships creative of human society. Morality involves judgment as to what is conducive to individual and societal fulfilment. A rising statistic of hooliganism is not on the way to providing a norm of behaviour, nor does the behaviour of cat and mouse suggest a pattern of nature to be copied by humans.</p> <p>George Monbiot's conclusion is so manifestly perverse as to suggest that the article is a spoof. With that key I have reread it with amusement. <b> <br> Rt Rev Mario Conti </b> <br>Bishop of Aberdeen</p> <p>\u0095 I would not countenance unity with the Roman Church until it has reformed its attitude to sexuality. Like George Monbiot I regard this as immoral. But I object to his use of the phrase \"ritual cannibalism\". This is deeply offensive to the deepest sacramental Christian beliefs. To use such unnecessary insult is to undermine his case. <br> <b>Rev John MacDonald Smith <br> </b> Evesham, Worcestershire</p> <p>\u0095 George Monbiot appears to believe that the only rationale for the Pope's complaint about the recent World Pride festival in Rome is that he must be gay. Therefore, we must conclude that Monbiot's repeated attacks on the Pope and church are due to him being a closet Catholic. <b> <br>Barbara Crowther</b> <br>London</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Monbiot knows of only two meanings of the word \"natural\" (Comment, July 13). He confuses the first with normal in the sense of what is usual statistically. His second sense relates to the world of birds and bees, the \"non-human world\". Odd behaviour there apparently justifies odd behaviour among humans on the basis that it is \"natural\". In order to appreciate what the Pope means when he describes homosexual behaviour as unnatural, \"contrary to the natural law\", you need to have another sense of the word nature, and be able to think beyond the empirical sciences. You need to understand function and purpose, and be able to situate individual human acts harmoniously in a network of relationships creative of human society. Morality involves judgment as to what is conducive to individual and societal fulfilment. A rising statistic of hooliganism is not on the way to providing a norm of behaviour, nor does the behaviour of cat and mouse suggest a pattern of nature to be copied by humans. George Monbiot's conclusion is so manifestly perverse as to suggest that the article is a spoof. With that key I have reread it with amusement. Rt Rev Mario Conti Bishop of Aberdeen \u0095 I would not countenance unity with the Roman Church until it has reformed its attitude to sexuality. Like George Monbiot I regard this as immoral. But I object to his use of the phrase \"ritual cannibalism\". This is deeply offensive to the deepest sacramental Christian beliefs. To use such unnecessary insult is to undermine his case. Rev John MacDonald Smith Evesham, Worcestershire \u0095 George Monbiot appears to believe that the only rationale for the Pope's complaint about the recent World Pride festival in Rome is that he must be gay. Therefore, we must conclude that Monbiot's repeated attacks on the Pope and church are due to him being a closet Catholic. Barbara Crowther London",

      "body": "<p>She was America's most famous evangelist, credited with miraculous powers and able to attract tens of thousands to her revivalist meetings.</p> <p>But today, for the first time in nearly 80 years, the temple which Aimee Semple McPherson created in Los Angeles has been closed, as the result of a fight that has split the church she founded and focused attention on leading evangelists in what is now a multi-million dollar business.</p> <p>As a beautiful and charismatic young woman in the 20s, McPherson created the Foursquare Gospel Church and, with a mixture of \"religious vaudeville\" and \"miracles\", built up a devoted following. From its beginnings at the temple, the church has grown to embrace more than 3m followers in more than 100 countries.</p> <p>When she died of a barbiturate overdose in 1944 at the age of 54, tens of thousands of mourners filed past her coffin. The church continued under the presidency of her son, Dr Rolf McPherson, but now the future of her mission is under threat in a battle between traditionalists and the new breed of evangelists.</p> <p>At the centre of the row is the Angelus Temple, an imposing domed building overlooking Echo Park in what is now a predominantly Latino part of the city.</p> <p><b> Vision </b><br></p> <p>Dedicated in 1923, it is credited by worshippers with having been built with divine assistance: McPherson had been told that her vision of the temple was structurally impossible but she persisted and it was built according to her instructions. It houses a spectacular mural showing the second coming of Christ, one of the main tenets of the church.</p> <p>Two years ago a husband and wife team, Ed and Ivy Stanton, arrived to take charge. As they saw it, the temple was run in a hopelessly old-fashioned way and was failing to attract the young. Part of the problem, they decided, was the poor lighting and acoustics, so they brought in builders to install a false ceiling which obscured the dome and mural.</p> <p>\"It was like deciding that Westminster Abbey wasn't contemporary enough and removing the whole of the interior,\" said Anna Crist, 66, a worshipper at the church. \"The mural has meant so much to so many of our people.\"</p> <p>She was also unhappy that the Stantons seemed to be preoccupied with looking for new worshippers in affluent white areas, while ignoring the poorer black and Latino parts of the city. She added that she found the new rock-based services offputting and the sermons uninspiring: \"I'm not judging - God is our judge - but we were going home empty from their preaching.\"</p> <p>She and other regulars decided to try to halt the changes and formed the Coalition to Save the Angelus Temple. They won support from the Los Angeles Conservancy, a historic preservation organisation, whose members were horrified at the plans to alter part of LA's heritage.</p> <p>\"It is quite astounding what they wanted to do,\" said Ken Bernstein, the conservancy's director of preservation issues. \"This is the mother church, the centre of a large international church and it's one of only a handful of national historic landmarks in the city.\"</p> <p>The coalition brought a civil case to halt the building works and succeeded in getting a temporary stay from the city council because the correct procedure had not been followed.</p> <p>In January Dr McPherson wrote an open letter to the Stantons accusing them of fatally damaging the ministry, adding: \"I don't know how you can ever restore communication and confidence if you ever want to.\"</p> <p>He and his wife stopped worshipping at the temple and now attend a Presbyterian church in Hollywood.</p> <p>The Stantons say they had no choice but to make the alterations. \"To be real candid,\" said Pastor Ed, as he is known, \"people's expectations today are very different from what they were in the 20s.

      "bodyText": "She was America's most famous evangelist, credited with miraculous powers and able to attract tens of thousands to her revivalist meetings. But today, for the first time in nearly 80 years, the temple which Aimee Semple McPherson created in Los Angeles has been closed, as the result of a fight that has split the church she founded and focused attention on leading evangelists in what is now a multi-million dollar business. As a beautiful and charismatic young woman in the 20s, McPherson created the Foursquare Gospel Church and, with a mixture of \"religious vaudeville\" and \"miracles\", built up a devoted following. From its beginnings at the temple, the church has grown to embrace more than 3m followers in more than 100 countries. When she died of a barbiturate overdose in 1944 at the age of 54, tens of thousands of mourners filed past her coffin. The church continued under the presidency of her son, Dr Rolf McPherson, but now the future of her mission is under threat in a battle between traditionalists and the new breed of evangelists. At the centre of the row is the Angelus Temple, an imposing domed building overlooking Echo Park in what is now a predominantly Latino part of the city. Vision Dedicated in 1923, it is credited by worshippers with having been built with divine assistance: McPherson had been told that her vision of the temple was structurally impossible but she persisted and it was built according to her instructions. It houses a spectacular mural showing the second coming of Christ, one of the main tenets of the church. Two years ago a husband and wife team, Ed and Ivy Stanton, arrived to take charge. As they saw it, the temple was run in a hopelessly old-fashioned way and was failing to attract the young. Part of the problem, they decided, was the poor lighting and acoustics, so they brought in builders to install a false ceiling which obscured the dome and mural. \"It was like deciding that Westminster Abbey wasn't contemporary enough and removing the whole of the interior,\" said Anna Crist, 66, a worshipper at the church. \"The mural has meant so much to so many of our people.\" She was also unhappy that the Stantons seemed to be preoccupied with looking for new worshippers in affluent white areas, while ignoring the poorer black and Latino parts of the city. She added that she found the new rock-based services offputting and the sermons uninspiring: \"I'm not judging - God is our judge - but we were going home empty from their preaching.\" She and other regulars decided to try to halt the changes and formed the Coalition to Save the Angelus Temple. They won support from the Los Angeles Conservancy, a historic preservation organisation, whose members were horrified at the plans to alter part of LA's heritage. \"It is quite astounding what they wanted to do,\" said Ken Bernstein, the conservancy's director of preservation issues. \"This is the mother church, the centre of a large international church and it's one of only a handful of national historic landmarks in the city.\" The coalition brought a civil case to halt the building works and succeeded in getting a temporary stay from the city council because the correct procedure had not been followed. In January Dr McPherson wrote an open letter to the Stantons accusing them of fatally damaging the ministry, adding: \"I don't know how you can ever restore communication and confidence if you ever want to.\" He and his wife stopped worshipping at the temple and now attend a Presbyterian church in Hollywood. The Stantons say they had no choice but to make the alterations. \"To be real candid,\" said Pastor Ed, as he is known, \"people's expectations today are very different from what they were in the 20s. People do not have the same tolerance.\" He said the acoustics were so bad that some parishioners had told him it sounded like \"you had marbles in your mouth\", adding that many of \"the old-timers\" sat in the best seats and were thus unaware of the problems. He rejected claims that the congregation had dipped from 600 to around 350, saying the opposite was true, and denied neglecting the poorer black areas. \"Our staff is very multi-cultural. We are very sensitive to that.\" Then, last Sunday, came a dramatic announcement from Pastor Ed - the Angelus Temple would close until further notice, and the church would move and reopen in September. He used the occasion to attack the coalition, saying: \"We do not serve structures. Structures serve people. When Jesus said he would build his church, he did not have bricks and mortar in mind, he had broken hearts in mind.\" Certainly the row is about very much more than the bricks and mortar. To the traditionalists, the Stantons with their $845,000 (\u00a3565,000) home and large number of staff represent the new breed of evangelists who run the church like a business and care little for parishioners who do not fit into the target market. Now the place where McPherson once preached to crowds of 5,000 is to stand empty and her followers are left to contemplate the message from Revelations that is carved on the temple wall: \"Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life.\"",

The cause? Walking around without shoes. No one has been threatened with a gun yet, but members of the Dirty Sole Society do endure scorn and sneering. Mr Hlavenka, for instance, recently strode purposefully through a bank, a market, a McDonald's restaurant and a Wal-Mart supermarket in a Chicago suburb, daring the pillars of the American mall to object to his bare feet. A Wal-Mart employee obliged. \"You can't walk around here without shoes, that's against the law.\" Actually, it isn't. Nor is it illegal to drive barefoot, unless you happen to find yourself on a motorcycle in Alabama, though some other states warn against the practice. The society, which has followers throughout the United States, exists to promote the physical and spiritual elevation it claims is to be derived from discarding socks and shoes. Members take as one of their texts an article written in 1914 by James Leith Macbeth Bain, the Scottish mystic, poet and spiritual healer otherwise known as Brother James. \"For some years past,\" he wrote, \"I have tasted the delight and realised the energy of the joy of drinking in the sun's heat by walking on the hot pavements of London and other cities, and even Edinburgh, the Athens of good taste . . . \"My body was simply aglow with radiant energy.\" Brother James was an advocate of going hatless, too, although he did warn that doing so could result in harmful exposure to the sun. But, he said: \"I have never found that there is any such risk in the most free use and exposure of the feet to the solar energy.\" Lest anyone should run away with the idea that going barefoot is something to be taken lightly, Brother Jack suggested a gradual approach involving the use of sandals in public as the first step. The compromise appealed to Mr Hlavenka when he decided three years ago that something really must be done about the pungent whiff emanating from his sneakers. At first he would tip-toe around the block in the dead of night when he was sure the neighbours would not see him. In time he progressed to slipping into petrol stations to buy cartons of milk. And now, his pleasure no longer a secret, he does everything, including shovelling snow, in his bare feet. Well, almost everything: he wears shoes to church. Mr Hlavenka is by no means the sole warrior in the barefoot battle. The society has about 600 members, and among the heroes of the struggle are a violinist who plays concerts in Manhattan in the regulation tuxedo but without benefit of shoes; a Methodist minister in Saratoga Springs, New York, who performs services and weddings barefoot; and a software engineer in Ohio who was sent for psychological evaluation after presenting himself for work wearing nothing below the ankles. \"The Dirty Sole Society is open to all who enjoy going barefoot everywhere regardless of age, gender, nationality, race, religion or sexual orientation,\" its manifesto says. But there is much work still to be done. Consider the indignity visited upon the society's founder.

      "bodyText": "Independent television footage has proved for the first time that Indonesian soldiers sent to restore order in the Molucca islands are fighting alongside militant Muslims against the Christians they are supposed to be protecting. The evidence, which confirms the suspicion that government troops are exacerbating the sectarian conflict, coincides with President Abdurrahman Wahid's admission that he may ask for international assistance in solving the crisis. Filmed at the weekend during a street battle in the region's main city, Ambon, the Associated Press Television News pictures show several Indonesian soldiers giving covering fire to about a dozen Muslim fighters. Many of the civilians were armed with automatic weapons, including domestically made rifles which are issued only to the armed forces. At nightfall, as houses and and churches burned, an army armoured car rumbled down the road to help the Muslims. The fact that several of the Muslims were heard speaking in Javanese rather than Indonesian or a local dialect suggests that they were members of Laskar Jihad, a fanatical Javanese organisation which sent several thousand fighters to the Moluccas in May to help the Muslim war effort. More than 40 people have been killed in Ambon in the past few days, including a pregnant Christian woman and her child, who died when a mortar round exploded in their home. Of the 20 fatalities at the weekend, 13 were Christians and seven were Muslims. More than 3,000 people have been killed and 500,000 left homeless since the fighting began in January last year. There have been many reports that some sections of the security forces, particularly local police units, have sided with the Christians and given them automatic weapons The defence minister, Juw ono Sudharsono, said in a newspaper interview on Saturday that he was powerless to intervene in the chain of command to ensure the replacement of the partisan troops. \"All I can give is advice and policy inputs to rehabilitate the entire army,\" he said. Mr Sudharsono reiterated the widely held belief that the \"rogue officers\" were associated with \"cronies\" of the former presidents General Suharto and BJ Habibie. Although he once again ruled out foreign military intervention in the crisis, Mr Wahid said yesterday that he might be willing to accept more than humanitarian assistance. \"If we cannot manage any more, we may cry for support in logistics and equipment only from abroad . . . not more than that,\" he told a meeting of provincial governors. At a meeting with European Union ambassadors he said he hoped to lift soon the restrictions on foreign aid and media access to the region imposed last month when a state of civil emergency was declared. \"We very much hope that following this meeting that international NGOs will be allowed back into the Moluccas very soon,\" the British ambassador, Sir Robin Christopher, said, adding that this would initially be done through the United Nations Development Programme. Sir Robin denied that Mr Wahid was under official pressure to allow foreign peacekeepers into the Moluccas. \"This remains a domestic problem for Indonesia and we think it is very important that the Indonesian government sorts it out,\" he said. \u0095Thick smog from forest fires in Indonesia blanketed parts of Sumatra yesterday and reduced visibility in Malaysia. The pall, caused by fires deliberately set to clear land for plantations, raised the fear of another health crisis like that of 1997, when forest-fire smoke covered several parts of south-east Asia, prompting thousands of tourists to cancel their visits . Environmentalists have criticised governments in the region for not learning the lesson and not giving more information about the health risks.",

      "bodyText": "Muslim guerrillas in the southern Philippines have freed the first European among the 35 hostages they have been holding for almost three months. Renate Allert, 56, a German, was handed over yesterday by the Abu Sayyaf rebel group to the Philippine government's chief negotiator, Robert Aventajado, near the rebel's camp on the island of Jolo. Her husband and son are among those still being held. As she was released, the army accused another Muslim separatist group in the same region of shooting dead 21 people it seized on Sunday. \"She was released purely as a goodwill gesture,\" Mr Aventajado told a local radio station, implying that no ransom had been paid. The rebels have demanded $1m for each hostage. Some officials say it will be impossible to secure the release of the others without money changing hands. Mrs Wallert has been suffering from hypertension and chest pains, according to doctors who visited the rebel camp. Her husband Werner collapsed 10 days ago after a party to celebrate the 25th birthday of their son, Marc. They were among the 21 people seized from the Malaysian resort island of Sipaden on April 23. Thirteen Philippine evangelists and four European journalists have been kidnapped since then. \"My family didn't come out today so I'm not totally happy,\" Mrs Wallert said after being flown to Zamboanga city. \"I hope the others will be released very soon, but I have no idea when this might happen.\" Abu Sayyaf commanders had previously released two Malaysians. One of them, Abdul Jawa Salawat, said yesterday that he was told just before his release on Friday that all the hostages would be freed in a few days. There have been many false dawns in the crisis, but many people believe the hostages will soon be free. \"These things have a habit of lasting about three months and so we are not too surprised that it seems to be unwinding now,\" a police spokesman said. Last night the army said the biggest Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, murdered 21 people in a mosque in Lanao del Sur province on the island of Mindanao. It said the victims were among 29 people kidnapped on Sunday and that they were executed the same day. The front blamed the military for the killings.",

A wave of applause broke out as the beaming, white-haired figure of the Villa chairman Doug Ellis made his way past them on Wembley's cinder track, occasionally pausing to sign autographs for cheery young supporters. </p> <p>It is hard to imagine Martin Edwards in the same circumstances. Among United fans, Edwards is a figure of loathing. Besides, strolling along the touchline engaging with his customers has never been the United chief executive's way. </p> <p>He has always preferred to draw as little attention as possible to himself, keen to keep the arclight of publicity with its attendant intrusion into his personal business at arm's length. And this week, he is making an equally unobtrusive withdrawal from the corridors of power at Old Trafford, standing down as chief executive after nearly 20 years in charge without fuss or flurry, depriving his critics of the opportunity to revel in a forced departure. </p> <p>In many ways, it ought to be the other way round: Edwards glowing in his fans' admiration, while Ellis steals in through the back door. While Ellis presides over a club that has consistently underachieved during his tenure, Edwards can point to an astonishing history of success on and off the field. </p> <p>\"What more do they want?\" he has been known to observe to colleagues. \"We've given them everything from the treble to the best stadium in the country and still they hate me.\" </p> <p>Tellingly, though, there appear to have been no behind-the-scenes deals desperately trying to keep Edwards in charge. Nor is the queue of other major companies wishing to tap into his expertise by offering him a directorship forming up along Sir Matt Busby Way. The news that he is to step down has been greeted at the club with a sigh of relief, as if an embarrassing relative has finally gone home, allowing everyone else to get on with the party. </p> <p>The reason Edwards is now quietly being allowed to relinquish power is the same as the root cause of his loathing among the fans. Worries have been growing within the organisation for some time that the way in which Edwards prefers to take business decisions to protect existing holdings is no longer compatible with the requirements of one of the country's biggest plcs. </p> <p>His 20 years in control have been characterised by extreme monetary caution. Apart from an ill-fated move into basketball, he has acted slowly and conservatively. It could be said that much of the team's success on the field has been achieved in spite of Edwards. Luckily for him, his reluctance to sanction big-money buys and his imposition of a rigid pay structure have been more than offset by Sir Alex Ferguson's gifted man management. </p> <p>And unlike Ellis at Villa, not one stand, not one player, not one megastore at Old Trafford has been financed from Edwards's pocket. The traffic has all been in the other direction: an estimated personal wealth of \u00a3100m from an investment of less than \u00a3100,000. Fans resent it, and the city does not find such tunnel vision a particularly attractive trait in chief executives either. Such caution might pass muster in a corner shop, but shareholders of large plcs want companies to grow and develop; they want entrepreneurial zest at the helm. </p> <p>The United website saga is a perfect example of the Edwards problem. When Peter Kenyon suggested that a site should be set up, Edwards insisted it should be a subscription service: here was the opportunity to extract yet more cash out of the fan base. He was persuaded it should be free only after it was pointed out the investment costs were minimal. Within six months of starting up, it was the most visited site in China, news that sent the United share value over \u00a31bn. </p> <p>For the past year the chairman of Manchester United plc, Sir Roland Smith, has been manoeuvring an alternative to Edwards into place, sensing that in the new era of the football business, clubs require dynamic leadership. </p> <p>Edwards's fellow board members might have over-looked many things - trouble with prostitutes, appaling public relations, even a corrosive rift with the company's two most significant employees, Ferguson and Roy Keane - but they could not ignore his inability to seize the broader picture. </p> <p>Perhaps he saw the end himself. When he tried to sell United to Rupert Murdoch, he claimed the \u00a387m he would have gained personally was only incidental. He was doing it, he said, because to go on into the new era, United needed new management ideas. The Murdoch bid may have failed, but at least Edwards can comfort himself that as of today the business his father left him has its new management.</p>",

But as the undisputed player of the triangular NatWest series so far he has been making a case that will be hard for David Graveney and the rest to ignore when they choose their squad in 12 days' time. </p> <p>His unbeaten 87 at Chester-le-Street on Saturday, scored out of 171 as England registered their first 10-wicket win in 314 limited-overs internationals, took his tally for the series to 244 at an average of 81, each run a switchblade in the heart of Mark Ramprakash and indeed Nick Knight, whose place in the one-day squad was taken by Trescothick after the Warwickshire left-hander broke a finger in the Lord's Test win two weeks ago. And, with Graham Thorpe making an impact on the England scene again and Nasser Hussain's cracked thumb all but ready to be tested - perhaps in the game against Zimbabwe at Edgbaston tomorrow afternoon - even Graeme Hick is threatened. </p> <p>Trescothick's success to date has been a feather in the cap of the England coach Duncan Fletcher who, after being appointed last July, spent the last months of his Glamorgan contract making note of those who impressed him against his county. In the case of Trescothick, who had captained England at Under-19 level and went on last winter's A tour to Bangladesh and New Zealand without being overly successful, this came in the form of an innings of 167 in a low-scoring game in Taunton in which no one else passed 50 and in which he peppered the local churchyard with the sort of muscular aerial bombardment that used to come from Ian Botham, Viv Richards and Arthur Wellard. </p> <p>\"I remember that, and a lot of his runs came against Jacques Kallis and it was very impressive,\" Fletcher said on Saturday. \"An innings like that can show that a guy can play. He has a simple technique and a very good temperament. He sits in the dressing room as if it's just another game, which is good to see because temperament is the key.\" </p> <p>If, or rather when, he plays Test cricket he will find life altogether harder than facing Zimbabwean medium-pacers and a West Indian attack shorn of its ageless cutting edge and its masculinity by the playing conditions of the game. He may even need to move his feet a little faster and with more purpose, although Fletcher would not be daft enough to want to tinker with something that is functioning quite nicely. But let's not quibble at present. Trescothick is indeed uncomplicated, refreshingly so, standing tall at the crease, thumping the ball on the front foot with the full face of the bat and, if necessary, rocking back from there to pull and cut with equal emphasis. </p> <p>The six he clumped over midwicket to finish the game was the sharpest of punctuation marks to an England performance a world away from the dross they had dished up the previous weekend. All the bowlers performed excellently, restricting West Indies to 169 for eight, and Brian Lara in particular to 54 from 101 balls by virtue of bowling straight and on a good length when 230 was the minimum on a blameless pitch (not a single wide in successive matches is a remarkable effort). The fielding and catching were also first rate, topped by Thorpe's stunner at short extra cover to get rid of Chris Gayle. </p> <p>West Indies, however, performed as poorly as England did well. The strong northerly wind was icy but Jimmy Adams' men, many of whom have played in county cricket and the leagues, made it obvious that they would rather be elsewhere. Everyone puts hands in pockets when it is cold but mentally West Indies never took them out. The batting was insipid and the bowling juvenile so that Trescothick and Alec Stewart (74 not out) had the game sewn up with almost 14 overs in hand and with England's third highest opening stand. </p> <p>The unequal nature of the contest did not detract from the effort that Durham had made to stage two games over the weekend. The pitches, notoriously unpredictable, played immaculately and, including a brace of male streakers who offended no one until one cavorted in front of the sightscreen (some things are just not done), a full house of 15,000 turned out in the wintry conditions, paying the same \u00a328 that was said to have deterred thousands from Old Trafford on Thursday. </p> <p>They want a Test match in these parts and they should be given one. Soon. </p> <p><strong> Scoreboard</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chester-le-Street: </strong> England (2pts) beat West Indies (0) by 10 wickets </p> <p><strong> West Indies </strong></p> <p><strong>S L Campbell</strong> c White b Mullally <strong> 14 </strong></p> <p><strong>W W Hinds</strong> lbw b Gough <strong> 1 </strong></p> <p><strong>B C Lara</strong> c Flintoff b Ealham <strong> 54 </strong></p> <p><strong>J C Adams</strong> b Mullally <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>C H Gayle</strong> c Thorpe b Caddick <strong> 26 </strong></p> <p><strong>R L Powell</strong> c Trescothick b Mullally <strong> 15 </strong></p> <p><strong>R D Jacobs</strong> c Stewart b White <strong> 25 </strong></p> <p><strong>F A Rose</strong> c Flintoff b Gough <strong> 18 </strong></p> <p><strong>N A M McLean</strong> not out <strong> 3 </strong></p> <p><strong>M Dillon</strong> not out <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (b1 lb6 nb6) <strong> 13 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 8, 50 overs) <strong> 169 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 6, 41, 43, 104, 104, 134, 162, 168. </p> <p><strong> Did not bat:</strong> R D King. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Caddick 10-1-30-1; Gough 10-1-38-2; Mullally 10-1-27-3; Ealham 10-2-31-1; Trescothick 2-0-13-0; White 8-1-23-1. </p> <p><strong> England </strong></p> <p><strong>M E Trescothick</strong> not out <strong> 87 </strong></p> <p><strong>A J Stewart</strong> not out <strong> 74 </strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (lb4 w1 nb5) <strong> 10 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 0, 35.2 overs) <strong> 171 </strong></p> <p><strong>Did not bat:</strong> A Flintoff, G A Hick, M P Maynard, G P Thorpe, C White, M A Ealham, A R Caddick, D Gough, A D Mullally. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> King 6-0-30-0; McLean 6-1-22-0; Dillon 6-0-24-0; Rose 5-0-31-0; Gayle 8-0-34-0; Adams 4-0-20-0; Powell 0.2-0-6-0. </p> <p><strong> Umpires:</strong> J H Hampshire and G Sharp.</p>",

Trescothick is indeed uncomplicated, refreshingly so, standing tall at the crease, thumping the ball on the front foot with the full face of the bat and, if necessary, rocking back from there to pull and cut with equal emphasis. The six he clumped over midwicket to finish the game was the sharpest of punctuation marks to an England performance a world away from the dross they had dished up the previous weekend. All the bowlers performed excellently, restricting West Indies to 169 for eight, and Brian Lara in particular to 54 from 101 balls by virtue of bowling straight and on a good length when 230 was the minimum on a blameless pitch (not a single wide in successive matches is a remarkable effort). The fielding and catching were also first rate, topped by Thorpe's stunner at short extra cover to get rid of Chris Gayle. West Indies, however, performed as poorly as England did well. The strong northerly wind was icy but Jimmy Adams' men, many of whom have played in county cricket and the leagues, made it obvious that they would rather be elsewhere. Everyone puts hands in pockets when it is cold but mentally West Indies never took them out. The batting was insipid and the bowling juvenile so that Trescothick and Alec Stewart (74 not out) had the game sewn up with almost 14 overs in hand and with England's third highest opening stand. The unequal nature of the contest did not detract from the effort that Durham had made to stage two games over the weekend. The pitches, notoriously unpredictable, played immaculately and, including a brace of male streakers who offended no one until one cavorted in front of the sightscreen (some things are just not done), a full house of 15,000 turned out in the wintry conditions, paying the same \u00a328 that was said to have deterred thousands from Old Trafford on Thursday. They want a Test match in these parts and they should be given one. Soon.

He made 105 off 115 balls including 14 fours, while Ganguly's 82 featured a six and 10 fours. </p> <p>Earlier, Somerset had looked in little trouble at 103 for two with Jamie Cox (45) and Peter Bowler (27) at the crease. But the partnership was broken on 45, after which the home side slumped. The spinners Chris Schofield and Gary Yates each took two wickets and Somerset were all out for 198. </p> <p>Leicestershire, who began the day in third place, also collapsed after a promising start against <strong> Northamptonshire </strong> at Grace Road. Aftab Habib (70) and Phil DeFreitas (40) gave the innings impetus with a fifth-wicket stand of 73. But when Habib was caught by Adrian Rollins at mid-on, the last six wickets fell for 26 with Darren Cousins and Tony Penberthy taking three wickets apiece. </p> <p>The Australian left-hander Matthew Hayden then saw the visitors home by four wickets with an ubeaten 96, including three sixes. </p> <p>Hayden's compatriot Michael Bevan took his National League average to 105 from eight innings with a fluent 89 not out, as <strong> Sussex </strong> beat <strong> Yorkshire</strong> by 70 runs at Arundel. </p> <p>Adam Hollioake hit his first century in any limited overs competition as <strong> Surrey</strong> went clear at the top of the Second Division with a 67-run win over <strong> Glamorgan</strong> at the Oval. Hollioake hit two sixes and nine fours before being out for 111. Then it was brother Ben's turn with the ball, taking four for 42 as Glamorgan were bowled out for 201.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Somerset and Leicestershire had the chance to make up ground on the National League First Division leaders but, like Worcestershire, they both lost. At Taunton Lancashire, having held out for a draw in the championship match on Saturday, added insult to injury yesterday with a seven-wicket win with as many over to spare. Mike Atherton, overlooked for England one-day duty, and the Indian Sourav Ganguly led the victory charge with Lancashire's record National League opening stand. They put on 192, Atherton hitting his second century in five days against Somerset. He made 105 off 115 balls including 14 fours, while Ganguly's 82 featured a six and 10 fours. Earlier, Somerset had looked in little trouble at 103 for two with Jamie Cox (45) and Peter Bowler (27) at the crease. But the partnership was broken on 45, after which the home side slumped. The spinners Chris Schofield and Gary Yates each took two wickets and Somerset were all out for 198. Leicestershire, who began the day in third place, also collapsed after a promising start against Northamptonshire at Grace Road. Aftab Habib (70) and Phil DeFreitas (40) gave the innings impetus with a fifth-wicket stand of 73. But when Habib was caught by Adrian Rollins at mid-on, the last six wickets fell for 26 with Darren Cousins and Tony Penberthy taking three wickets apiece. The Australian left-hander Matthew Hayden then saw the visitors home by four wickets with an ubeaten 96, including three sixes. Hayden's compatriot Michael Bevan took his National League average to 105 from eight innings with a fluent 89 not out, as Sussex beat Yorkshire by 70 runs at Arundel. Adam Hollioake hit his first century in any limited overs competition as Surrey went clear at the top of the Second Division with a 67-run win over Glamorgan at the Oval. Hollioake hit two sixes and nine fours before being out for 111. Then it was brother Ben's turn with the ball, taking four for 42 as Glamorgan were bowled out for 201.",

Nor will his son automatically succeed him to the presidency. If that seems a reasonable state of affairs, whether you know it or not, you are a republican. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>It is no longer shocking to hear of secondary school students becoming involved with drugs. It would be shocking but not unprecedented to find primary school students doing the same. However, this is the story of a primary school headteacher who was sacked last month for stealing from her school after becoming embroiled in the payment of drug debts to a gang of armed crack dealers.</p> <p>If you wanted to find a perfect symbol for the poisonous spread of poverty into Britain's schools and for the almost equally toxic effect of government policy on education, you need look no further than the strange and terrible story of Angela Ellis, who was the dynamic and successful headteacher of Stamford Hill primary school in Haringey, north London, until she fell foul of yardie dealers.</p> <p>For two years, staff at the school witnessed a series of increasingly bizarre incidents. In the summer of 1998, somebody who had access to school keys stole cash and cheques from the safe. Classroom computers went missing and turned up in pawn shops. The money that the school steel band had earned disappeared. The headteacher had \"strange visitors\" in her office, went missing for long periods, borrowed a total of \u00a33,500 from staff and called in to say she could not come to work, because she was hiding from yardies who were threatening to kill her.</p> <p>After her sacking last month, Ellis, now 40, homeless and penniless, spoke to us. She talked about the night when a gun was held to her head, about a brother who was killed by dealers and a son who ran up huge debts to yardies, which she tried to pay off. She says she never used drugs herself. \"It's about a drug culture that surrounds me,\" she said.</p> <p>Her story uncovers a picture of a school invaded by the crude violence of its surroundings, of a desperate headteacher collapsing into chaos and, perhaps most significant, of the catastrophic failure of every single system that was supposed to support her:</p> <p>\u0095 Ofsted visited a full year after staff first noted behaviour and yet the inspection team passed the school and commended Angela Ellis's vision;</p> <p>\u0095 The school had no effective governing body - the chairman had resigned and not been replaced, there were unfilled vacancies, some governors failed to turn up and the governing body had simply ceased to run the school;</p> <p>\u0095 Haringey local education authority consistently failed to support the school and then found it had been stripped of the power to deal with the crisis;</p> <p>\u0095 The Department for Education was intent on privatising parts of the LEA, pushed out the director of education and tied up senior officials in long political negotiations.</p> <p>Those close to the school say it is an extreme example of the danger of the government's drive to bypass LEAs, pushing funds and power down to headteachers and governors who may not have the time or the skills to handle them. They say the school had suffered a series of cuts in budget which had put enormous stress on the head.</p> <p>Ellis does not pretend she did right. \"I'm not saying I was completely innocent. Perhaps I am involved deeper than I want to be in things around me, but I was still trying to pull it together and run a school and run a personal life that was all falling apart. It has been a seedy underworld, but you have to protect people around you.\"</p> <p>She had been a teacher for six years before she transferred to Stamford Hill in September 1995. The primary school, which has 260 pupils, stands on the edge of a notorious red light area. \"There is drugs and prostitution day and night. We get drugs stuff in the playground, coming in off the street.\" In September 1997, she became headteacher. She tried to protect the school from its surroundings with extra security - a higher perimeter fence and a buzzer on the door to keep out intruders - but the drugs culture reached her at home.</p> <p>She had friends and family who were using crack cocaine. In the winter of 1998, her brother, a dealer, was run off the road and killed in New York. Her 24-year-old son was using heavily. She says she does not know who broke into the school safe that summer but adds that she used to leave her keys lying around at home.</p> <p>She knows it was someone in her family who pawned the school's iMac computers. \"People that were close to me used it as a means of paying off what can only be described as drug debts. It was an indirect thing. I didn't realise at the time what was going on. At various times I took computers out of the school with the intention of returning them, but then it all got out of hand. I know who took them to the pawn shop. They had been in my home about two weeks before they went. I didn't personally take them but in an indirect way, I was responsible.\"</p> <p>As her problems at home worsened, she began to suffer from the stress of her work. The school's budget has been hit by annual cuts of at least \u00a330,000. At about the time she became head, the roof fell in on two classrooms, and it was 18 months before the LEA repaired it. The chairman of governors wrote 56 letters to the LEA pleading for help, received answers to only six and was given no extra funds. The school had trouble recruiting teachers and was forced to take on expensive supply staff. According to one of those who worked with Ellis, \"she began to unravel\". She went to the doctor and started to take time off for stress.</p> <p>In June 1999, after a two-week absence, she returned to prepare for an Ofsted inspection, working until 3am on paperwork until, she says, she was so exhausted she had to ask the chairman of governors to deliver the papers for her. In their report, the inspectors praised her vision, although they noted that she carried a considerable workload. Ellis, however, drowning in stress after the Ofsted visit, simply failed to turn up to plan the new school year, and some parents brought their children to school in September without knowing what classes they were to be in.</p> <p>That month, staff approached the chairman of governors about the headteacher's absences and about missing cash and school equipment. The LEA was given a written account of their worries. The LEA agreed to send the head to occupational health, who confirmed she was ill, but blocked the chair of governor's request for an audit of the school's finances and a running check on the whereabouts of computers. In November, the chairman resigned in protest at the LEA's failure to act.</p> <p>Ellis was now alone. She belonged to no union. The chairman had been very active, but no one was appointed to replace him. The governing body was short of co-opted members because so few people in the community were willing to do the job. Some LEA governors failed to turn up. Months passed without a meeting. Haringey LEA was no better, distracted by a highly critical Ofsted inspection and embroiled in a struggle for survival with private consultants acting for the DfEE. Officials spent days in negotiations. The director of education was pushed out by ministers . Ellis says the LEA link inspector was very good but his time was stretched across too many schools. \"The LEA could see I needed help. They just let me work through it, no matter how many stress certificates I sent in.\"</p> <p>She says she was too distracted by stress to see how tightly crack cocaine was gripping some of those close to her. She found out in January, when three Yardies came to her house. \"Somebody opened the door and they burst in. One of them held a gun to my head and they made demands for money they said they were owed. They said certain members of my family around the world would die. They knew my brother had died. They wanted \u00a35,500.\"</p> <p>That week, she and her son left their house. Ellis borrowed from her family and from teachers at school, a total of \u00a33,500. Staff became increasingly fearful of their head's associates, who would disappear into her office or simply take her off for the day. One teacher agreed to meet the head and her boyfriend in the street to hand over \u00a3300 and was so unnerved by the experience that she was scared to sleep in her house.</p> <p>Kitchen staff found someone had stolen their weekly lottery money; petty cash that had been earned by the steel band went missing. Ellis denies that she ever stole from the school. She agrees that she started to disappear for long periods. \"I had a conversation with my deputy head and I said my life was at risk and I had left my home. My son had been run over, and I think it was no accident. I went to a safe house.\"</p> <p>She was in real fear of the yardies - too scared to go to the police, too scared to identify them. It occurred to her that they might even attack the school to put pressure on her. \"If they want to protect themselves, they will kill - whoever gets in the way, they will just take out other people.\"</p> <p>On January 18, with more computers missing and the head borrowing cash in the staffroom, teachers went to their union. On February 15, a group of governors met but still could not agree on a new chair. The next day, with the NUT pushing, two LEA officials met staff, but the LEA had long ago lost the power to suspend or sack the headteacher. That was the job of the chair of governors. Who did not exist. The LEA agreed to set up an audit.</p> <p>Two more months passed. The governors could not appoint a chair. There was a rumour that the headteacher had broken in at night with a man and slept there.</p> <p>Ellis says this never happened. Finally, on April 11, a new governor was co-opted by the LEA and agreed to become chairwoman. Nine days later, she suspended the head.</p> <p>The LEA audit team reported. Four computers, two laptops and video equipment were missing. And they had found a bag which the headteacher had left which contained cheques which had been stolen from the school safe in 1998. Some of them had been used with the forged signature of one of the governors. Ellis denies ever seeing the stolen cheques let alone forging signatures on them. On May 11, her pay was stopped. On June 7, she was sacked for gross misconduct.</p> <p>Now, she has been enveloped by the poverty which she once tried to keep outside the school fence. Paying off the drug debts, she could not afford the rent on her home and has lost it. She put possessions into storage and believes she has lost them too because she failed to pay the weekly fee. \"The clothes I am wearing are all I have,\" she said. \"I sleep at a friend's house.\"</p> <p>She is angry with the LEA. \"The only time they stepped in was to say that I had commited all these crimes and that was the end of my contract. I got one lousy letter to say they were going to assess my fitness to run the school.</p> <p>\"I have never taken drugs. I have never even smoked a cigarette. I don't even drink alcohol. Thing just spiralled out of control. They think I was doing this for personal gain. I have never gained anything from what was going on around me.\"</p> <p>But mostly, she is angry with herself: \"I have been a really lousy parent and really lousy to people around me that needed my support. It's obvious I can't teach any more because this thing is going to be round my neck for the rest of my life.</p> <p>\"I'm a head. A head is not supposed to want help. Everybody else comes to school with problems and I am supposed to sort them out.\"</p> <p>Additional research by Helene Mulholland</p>",

He said the propensity to violence was one reason the government was rushing through anti-hooligan legislation in the Commons this week. Ann Widdecombe, shadow home secretary, denied that football violence was a peculiarly English problem, but said that Mr Straw had made concessions on the bill. The bill, which includes powers for police to detain people for up to 12 hours on suspicion that they are planning to travel abroad to cause disorder, is due to have its committee stage today. Mr Straw, speaking on GMTV, said he thought racists and xenophobes had attached themselves to the English official supporters' club. He said almost every public institution in Britain was infected by the \"institutional racism\" detected in the Metropolitan police by the Macpherson report on the death of Stephen Lawrence. Interviewed by Sir Herman Ouseley, former head of the Campaign for Racial Equality, Mr Straw said the Euro 2000 riots had proved that hooliganism could not be blamed on a small, hardcore minority of thugs.",

      "body": "<p>It is galling for journalists to accept, but there can't be the least doubt: price cuts make a difference. Circulation rises whenever a paper sells itself cheaply, whether tabloid or broadsheet. Look at the Scotsman's phenomenal surge over the past two months, up from 78,000 in April to a record-breaking 105,000 last month, due to a discounting operation as potent in its results as the one launched by Rupert Murdoch in 1993 to boost the Times's sale. </p> <p>The Mirror, having suffered a blip in its gradual sales rise of recent times, cut its price to 20p last Saturday and added something like 500,000 more sales. The Sun, also at 20p that day, rose dramatically too. The Daily Telegraph couldn't hope to survive unless almost half its sale was at a cut rate. Similarly, the Independent's tenuous grip on a 225,000 headline sale is reliant on 30,000 discounts and 34,000 bulks. </p> <p>Too many modern newspaper readers have come to expect something for nothing. Some are promiscuous, cherry-picking daily for the best buy. Many don't always give up their regular paper, but take an extra one. </p> <p>Occasionally, these expensive exercises bear long-term fruit. The Times did hang on to a great deal of its audience and it will be interesting to see if the Scotsman, which is dedicated to maintaining its price cut, can do the same. It faces new competition soon from a Swedish-owned business daily. </p> <p>Among the tabloids, which often get spectacular increases when they cut prices, holding on to buyers is much more difficult. The vast majority disappear overnight. They are undoubtedly losing sales to the free Metro, as the haemorrhage of their sales in London proves. </p> <p>But papers which have preferred to concentrate their resources on consistent editorial excellence and flair have been less disturbed by either the Metro phenomenon or the price-cut fluctuations. They include the Daily Mail, which is owned by the Metro's publisher, the Guardian and, wait for it, the Daily Star. </p> <p>The Star has enjoyed a surprisingly steady sales record in the past year, a tribute to its editor Peter Hill and his able deputy, Hugh Whittow, along with their small staff. It has weathered the sales decline far better than its better-resourced red-top rivals. </p> <p>But the Star's future, like that of all Express Newspapers titles, is uncertain. Will they survive whatever emerges from the eventual media conglomeration fought over by their owners, United, along with Carlton and Granada? </p> <p>I thought I detected a turn-around in the fortunes of the Daily Express recently and possibly even a halt to the rise of the Daily Mail. Yet another good month for the Mail and a lacklustre one for the Express disproves my thesis. The undeniable truth is that improvements to the Express don't impinge one iota on the Mail. It may have an awful lot of Labour-voting readers, but they prefer the editorial package of their right-wing paper. This would have been no surprise to the Mail's founder, Lord Northcliffe. One of his reasons for launching the Mail was his belief that the wider public were not too interested in politics. Oddly, the Mail carries many more political stories and features than the Express. But these are expertly mixed with a range of human interest material which the Express just doesn't have space for. </p> <p>In the Sunday market, there is no doubting the strength of the Observer's revival, accomplished by making small, incremental advances without the aid of price-cutting. Its intelligent monthly sports magazine OSM, which was promoted on television, probably had an effect. But there has been an all-round editorial improvement while, over at the rival Independent on Sunday, there was a worrying dip in sales despite widespread discounting. Sometimes, it seems, even price cuts don't work! </p> <p>RG</p>",

It has weathered the sales decline far better than its better-resourced red-top rivals. But the Star's future, like that of all Express Newspapers titles, is uncertain. Will they survive whatever emerges from the eventual media conglomeration fought over by their owners, United, along with Carlton and Granada? I thought I detected a turn-around in the fortunes of the Daily Express recently and possibly even a halt to the rise of the Daily Mail. Yet another good month for the Mail and a lacklustre one for the Express disproves my thesis. The undeniable truth is that improvements to the Express don't impinge one iota on the Mail. It may have an awful lot of Labour-voting readers, but they prefer the editorial package of their right-wing paper. This would have been no surprise to the Mail's founder, Lord Northcliffe. One of his reasons for launching the Mail was his belief that the wider public were not too interested in politics. Oddly, the Mail carries many more political stories and features than the Express. But these are expertly mixed with a range of human interest material which the Express just doesn't have space for. In the Sunday market, there is no doubting the strength of the Observer's revival, accomplished by making small, incremental advances without the aid of price-cutting. Its intelligent monthly sports magazine OSM, which was promoted on television, probably had an effect. But there has been an all-round editorial improvement while, over at the rival Independent on Sunday, there was a worrying dip in sales despite widespread discounting. Sometimes, it seems, even price cuts don't work! RG",

We are the official opposition in the Scots parliament, we have over 200 local councillors, we lead the Scottish opinion polls and are at over 30% in the Westminster polls. I am absolutely convinced that the SNP will win the next Scottish election and take Scotland forward to independence. However, translating that political success onto a personal level, that would effectively lock me into a further decade as party leader. I have decided instead to pass on the torch. We have demonstrated that we have a strong team in the Scots parliament and a number of colleagues are well capable of leading the SNP. In order to give people the full opportunity to submit nominations in this new situation, in consultation with the national secretary, I have extended the deadline for all conference nominations until Friday, August 4. It has been a rare privilege to lead the SNP over the past decade. In addition, I have enjoyed myself enormously. I have no complaints and no regrets.

      "body": "<p>What are we to make of the Sunday Times? It is a very successful newspaper, handsomely out-selling its rivals with a regular sale in excess of 1.3m. It is a highly professional package with its specialised sections appealing to a broad range of people. It has enjoyed a fine postwar history, transforming itself under the guidance of Denis Hamilton and, later, Harold Evans, from a rather staid paper into a challenging, agenda-setting must-buy for the middle classes. </p> <p>Despite the misgivings of its staff and some readers, it has prospered under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch and did not, as doom-mongers forecast, decline under the editorship of Andrew Neil. Readers were clearly not put off by his championing of the free market and support for the Tory party. In the years since October 1994, when John Witherow became editor, he has largely kept the paper on its previous political course. But it has been impossible to ignore the groundswell of dissatisfaction from people who have featured in the paper's news pages, its main section. </p> <p>I have received more unsolicited complaints about the Sunday Times than any other paper and I have written twice in the past year about two very different kinds of story, involving the treatment meted out to ecology protesters and to Prince William. </p> <p>Many other instances of alleged inaccuracy, distortion and misrepresentation have remained on file and I may well have ignored them but for the sudden eruption of complaints in recent months. </p> <p>I accept that people and institutions who are embarrassed by stories routinely grumble about the press but it would appear from my conversations, both casual and formal, that the Sunday Times appears to have lost its credibility among the nation's opinion-formers. Readers, on the other hand, have largely remained in the dark about its many alleged errors because, according to the host of complainants I have spoken to, the paper is reluctant to admit any wrong-doing. </p> <p>This certainly chimes with my experience of having put a number of specific allegations about supposedly untrue stories to the paper. In every instance, the paper's managing editor, Richard Caseby, totally rejected fundamental criticisms of falsehood, in spite of the complainants including the Churches of England and Scotland, St James's Palace, a leading bank and senior political figures. </p> <p>Caseby's point is that the Sunday Times is \"an aggressive investigative paper which often writes about subjects people prefer to keep hidden\". In other words, they would complain, wouldn't they? So, given the yawning gap between the paper's view and the views of its \"victims\", which are backed by my own hunches and experience, I present the case for and against the Sunday Times over 10 hotly disputed stories. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 1: </strong> Last December, the paper's hyperactive royal correspondent Christopher Morgan announced: \"Queen states she will never meet Camilla.\" Months later she did so. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday Times reply: </strong> \"The report was an accurate reflection of the Queen's feeling at the time and she is entitled to change her mind.\" </p> <p> <strong> Claim 2: </strong> On June 18, Morgan, who doubles as the paper's religious affairs correspondent, wrote a story headlined: \"Charles explores Scottish wedding with Camilla\". This claimed that the Prince of Wales was \"exploring\" the possibility of marrying Camilla Parker Bowles in \"secret discussions\" with the Church of Scotland. </p> <p>Both St James's Palace and the Church's spokespersons denied the story. Instead of making a formal complaint, the moderator of the Church of Scotland, Andrew McLellan, decided to \"set the record straight\" in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live. In a straightforward reply to interviewer Nicky Campbell, he denied that any such discussions had occurred. </p> <p>On Friday, St James's Palace made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) about both that story and another involving Prince William. </p> <p> <strong> Reply: </strong> The Sunday Times stands by its story and points to the fact that the moderator later told the Tablet that a Scottish marriage for the Prince could not be ruled out. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 3: </strong> The Church of England contested a front-page story in April, again by Morgan, which alleged that the Archbishop of Canterbury was \"anxious\" for Charles to marry Camilla. Despite strenuous attempts to get the paper to carry a retraction of what they regarded as a totally false story, the Church's press office eventually threw in the towel. </p> <p> <strong> Reply: </strong> \"The Archbishop hasn't denied the story, merely questioned its sourcing.\" </p> <p> <strong> Claim 4: </strong> Yet another Morgan story of two weeks ago, headlined \"Blair blocks church choice of two bishop candidates\" claimed that Tony Blair had rejected the Church of England's preferred candidates for two bishoprics.

      "bodyText": "What are we to make of the Sunday Times? It is a very successful newspaper, handsomely out-selling its rivals with a regular sale in excess of 1.3m. It is a highly professional package with its specialised sections appealing to a broad range of people. It has enjoyed a fine postwar history, transforming itself under the guidance of Denis Hamilton and, later, Harold Evans, from a rather staid paper into a challenging, agenda-setting must-buy for the middle classes. Despite the misgivings of its staff and some readers, it has prospered under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch and did not, as doom-mongers forecast, decline under the editorship of Andrew Neil. Readers were clearly not put off by his championing of the free market and support for the Tory party. In the years since October 1994, when John Witherow became editor, he has largely kept the paper on its previous political course. But it has been impossible to ignore the groundswell of dissatisfaction from people who have featured in the paper's news pages, its main section. I have received more unsolicited complaints about the Sunday Times than any other paper and I have written twice in the past year about two very different kinds of story, involving the treatment meted out to ecology protesters and to Prince William. Many other instances of alleged inaccuracy, distortion and misrepresentation have remained on file and I may well have ignored them but for the sudden eruption of complaints in recent months. I accept that people and institutions who are embarrassed by stories routinely grumble about the press but it would appear from my conversations, both casual and formal, that the Sunday Times appears to have lost its credibility among the nation's opinion-formers. Readers, on the other hand, have largely remained in the dark about its many alleged errors because, according to the host of complainants I have spoken to, the paper is reluctant to admit any wrong-doing. This certainly chimes with my experience of having put a number of specific allegations about supposedly untrue stories to the paper. In every instance, the paper's managing editor, Richard Caseby, totally rejected fundamental criticisms of falsehood, in spite of the complainants including the Churches of England and Scotland, St James's Palace, a leading bank and senior political figures. Caseby's point is that the Sunday Times is \"an aggressive investigative paper which often writes about subjects people prefer to keep hidden\". In other words, they would complain, wouldn't they? So, given the yawning gap between the paper's view and the views of its \"victims\", which are backed by my own hunches and experience, I present the case for and against the Sunday Times over 10 hotly disputed stories. Claim 1: Last December, the paper's hyperactive royal correspondent Christopher Morgan announced: \"Queen states she will never meet Camilla.\" Months later she did so. Sunday Times reply: \"The report was an accurate reflection of the Queen's feeling at the time and she is entitled to change her mind.\" Claim 2: On June 18, Morgan, who doubles as the paper's religious affairs correspondent, wrote a story headlined: \"Charles explores Scottish wedding with Camilla\". This claimed that the Prince of Wales was \"exploring\" the possibility of marrying Camilla Parker Bowles in \"secret discussions\" with the Church of Scotland. Both St James's Palace and the Church's spokespersons denied the story. Instead of making a formal complaint, the moderator of the Church of Scotland, Andrew McLellan, decided to \"set the record straight\" in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live. In a straightforward reply to interviewer Nicky Campbell, he denied that any such discussions had occurred. On Friday, St James's Palace made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) about both that story and another involving Prince William. Reply: The Sunday Times stands by its story and points to the fact that the moderator later told the Tablet that a Scottish marriage for the Prince could not be ruled out. Claim 3: The Church of England contested a front-page story in April, again by Morgan, which alleged that the Archbishop of Canterbury was \"anxious\" for Charles to marry Camilla. Despite strenuous attempts to get the paper to carry a retraction of what they regarded as a totally false story, the Church's press office eventually threw in the towel. Reply: \"The Archbishop hasn't denied the story, merely questioned its sourcing.\" Claim 4: Yet another Morgan story of two weeks ago, headlined \"Blair blocks church choice of two bishop candidates\" claimed that Tony Blair had rejected the Church of England's preferred candidates for two bishoprics. A Church of England spokesman said: \"The story is untrue, simple as that.\" It was also flatly denied by Downing Street. Reply: \"Our sourcing is impeccable. It isn't surprising that both No 10 and Lambeth Palace deny it because it's so embarrassing.\" Claim 5: In April this year a splash headlined \"High-street bank backs Rover bid\" said that Abbey National was to fund the car firm's takeover by Phoenix. An Abbey National spokeswoman told me unequivocally that the story was wholly untrue. Reply: \"Abbey National admitted the following week that it was in negotiations to provide commercial finance for both Phoenix and Rover dealers through one of its subsidiaries.\" Claim 6: A story on April 16 alleged that the Labour party's parliamentary chairman, Clive Soley, had described old people as \"racist\". He immediately complained to the PCC, vehemently denying having said such a thing and claiming to have been misquoted. I have known Soley for many years and it's fair to say that we have disagreed profoundly over his past attempts to introduce press regulation. But even when our debates have been heated, I have never found him less than honest. I just cannot imagine him saying anything as crass as the paper implied, nor is it likely that he would have lied about it. During the course of the PCC's attempts to negotiate a deal, the paper provided a transcript of a tape-recorded conversation between Soley and one of their reporters. But Soley remains convinced that there is important contextual matter missing from the transcript and the PCC's attempt at conflict resolution has so far failed. Reply: \"The paper stands by its story and by the validity of its transcript.\" Caseby says: \"If Mr Soley feels he did not accurately convey his position we have offered to clarify it. To date he has failed to respond to this overture.\" Claim 7: Last week Lord Levy also submitted a formal complaint to the PCC about the Sunday Times's story on his tax affairs. The precise terms of the letter are confidential, though it is known that Levy is arguing that the paper broke three clauses of the editors' code of practice. Reply: \"The paper is satisfied that its stories about Levy are true in substance and detail.\" Caseby says: \"We welcome the chance to demonstrate that we have complied fully with the editors' code.\" Claim 8: The Levy case, which rests on the paper's alleged distortion of facts, highlights one of the problems complainants often face, as I discovered when looking at another dispute in which the Campaign for State Education (Case) complained about a story in June last year which claimed the group was planning \"to close 60 grammar schools\". When the then chairman of Case, David Gordon, wrote to protest that all the central allegations were untrue he was surprised to receive a strong letter in defence of a story he thought indefensible. The paper would not even agree to correct its most obvious error: Gordon was called Wood in the story. \"In the end,\" says Gordon, \"I just gave up.

Since then, he has had to drop his idea for instant fines for drunken yobs after the police said it was unworkable. He has also suffered a scathing attack from Ken Follett, the novelist and Labour supporter, who accused the government of being all spin and no substance. Poor performances at question time have similarly eroded Mr Blair's reputation for surefootedness.</p> <p>Labour ministers have tried gamely to turn the leaked memo into a positive, arguing that it showed Mr Blair was ahead of events. Education secretary David Blunkett said: \"The leak of the memo is not welcome, but the contents spell out a prime minister who is concerned, who is engaged, who is ahead of some of the issues which have blown up since. It is a prime minister one step ahead of the reality of what then hit us.\"</p> <p>Mo Mowlam echoed that sentiment as Labour closed ranks behind the embattled Mr Blair. \"There is no suggestion we are out of touch. To say we are is not the case, it is a myth. I do not feel that we have things drastically wrong. We are sticking to what we are doing and we are confident about where we are going but we are not complacent or over-confident.\"</p> <p>Labour will try to regain the initiative tomorrow when the chancellor, Gordon Brown, unveils his comprehensive spending review. He is expected to announce big spending increases for education and the police. Mr Blair is particularly sensitive to charges that he is soft on crime, especially in the light of the memorable Labour soundbite he coined during the 1997 election campaign - \"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\".</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power: Special report</a><br></p>",

It comes from the prime minister himself. It shows that the government gets very rattled that we are now setting the agenda. They don't really know where to turn next. We have got a government that is only in government in order to fight elections.\" Conservative party chairman Michael Ancram said the leak was a sign of the turmoil within the government itself. \"Everybody is attacking each other, they are all trying to undermine each other,\" he said. The leaked memo is the latest blow to Mr Blair, who has looked increasingly accident-prone ever since he was heckled during a speech at the Women's Institute several weeks ago. Since then, he has had to drop his idea for instant fines for drunken yobs after the police said it was unworkable. He has also suffered a scathing attack from Ken Follett, the novelist and Labour supporter, who accused the government of being all spin and no substance. Poor performances at question time have similarly eroded Mr Blair's reputation for surefootedness. Labour ministers have tried gamely to turn the leaked memo into a positive, arguing that it showed Mr Blair was ahead of events. Education secretary David Blunkett said: \"The leak of the memo is not welcome, but the contents spell out a prime minister who is concerned, who is engaged, who is ahead of some of the issues which have blown up since. It is a prime minister one step ahead of the reality of what then hit us.\" Mo Mowlam echoed that sentiment as Labour closed ranks behind the embattled Mr Blair. \"There is no suggestion we are out of touch. To say we are is not the case, it is a myth. I do not feel that we have things drastically wrong. We are sticking to what we are doing and we are confident about where we are going but we are not complacent or over-confident.\" Labour will try to regain the initiative tomorrow when the chancellor, Gordon Brown, unveils his comprehensive spending review. He is expected to announce big spending increases for education and the police. Mr Blair is particularly sensitive to charges that he is soft on crime, especially in the light of the memorable Labour soundbite he coined during the 1997 election campaign - \"Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\".

Sanz had widely been expected to win another term: his five-year reign brought two European Cups to the Bernabeu, the first of which, in 1998, ended a 32-year wait for Europe's ultimate prize. But Perez's controversial pledge to sign Luis Figo from Barcelona swung the result, and he was backed by 55% of the 30,000 club members who voted. Perez claimed to have an agreement to sign Figo from Real's great rivals in a $57m deal. Although Figo himself denied the story, Perez stuck to his guns and even made an $8.5m promise to pay the season-ticket fees of club members if he was elected and failed to close the deal. The Figo controversy overshadowed Sanz's on-field successes, as did Perez's claims that the club debt was running at $247m - Sanz insisted Real were no more than $110m in the red. Perez also benefited from his greater organisation in rounding-up postal votes, where he had a clear majority - voting in person at the club's training ground complex yesterday was said to be much closer. Sanz's defeat means he will not realise his personal ambition of leading Real in their centenary celebrations in 2002.

People had children, often in numbers, and they drove those children around without purchasing a vehicle the size of a bread van. I grew up in a family of six, which probably could have made good use of a people carrier, had such a thing existed. But we travelled about in a Morris Minor, sitting on each other's heads. </p> <p>People won't tolerate that now. These days, children from six months upwards require their own aircraft-style reclining seat, drinks holder, personal stowage pocket and tip-down table device. If you don't offer them these facilities as standard, they simply won't go anywhere with you. Many of today's parents face a straightforward decision: buy 20 grand's worth of luxury bus or have no family life worth speaking of. </p> <p>The VW Sharan - which first came out five years ago, but which is now back with us in a set of restyled, second-generation models - is 20 grand's worth of luxury bus. Twenty-five grand's worth if you want the Sport V6 version with the five-speed tiptronic gearbox. </p> <p>It has drinks holders coming out of its ears, or rather its dashboard and seats. It is imposingly roomy and tall (from a seat in the back, you can see over hedges and into people's bedrooms). It accommodates seven people comfortably (so long as at least two of them are small). Nobody is required to sit on anybody else's head. It's full of light - inevitably, given that it contains as much glass as a medium-sized conservatory. And it goes pretty fast and handles like a car. Well, more like a car than like a bread van. </p> <p>A shame, then, about that name, which seems to cry out for a VW Tracey as a companion piece. The idea is that you should stress the second syllable (\"Sha- ran \") but in any case, when it comes to car names, VW seem heroically untroubled by the possibility of unfortunate resonances in the British marketplace. This, after all, is the company that produces a vehicle called a Bora (named after a wind, apparently, rather than after somebody you wouldn't want to be trapped with at a party). </p> <p>It's German, so the doors go chunk rather than poing, and it's a VW, so everything about it is reassuringly solid, properly anchored to what it's meant to be anchored to. It has lots of tidy pieces of design, such as the doorhandles, the catch on the rear door and the cute silver bullets that hold the additional indicators on the side of the car. At night, the clocks light up mauve, which is very nice, assuming you like mauve. </p> <p>What's more, you can jigger about with the seating plan - fold the rear seats down to create tables, push seats back or pull them out. At their own request, I posted my children in the seats right at the back, which seemed to have for them the same allure that rear coach seats on school trips will hold for them in a few years' time. The fact is, they could monkey about with impunity there because, from where I was, they might as well have been in the car behind. </p> <p>But if you wish, you can get front seats that spin through 180 degrees, enabling you to face your passengers around a small work surface. (Note: best not try this while the car is in motion.) I can only think that when VW refer to possible \"business applications\" for the Sharan, they mean this aspect, which in effect reconfigures the vehicle as a mobile conference room. Alternatively, you can remove all five of the rear seats altogether and convert your Sharan into the thinking man's white van. </p> <p>Beyond its adaptability, though, perhaps the most impressive thing about the Sharan is the evidence it offers of VW's familiarity with parental paranoias. The button that locks all the doors from the inside is thoughtfully placed beside the window controls, just by your right hand, so you can slam your fist down on it if you see anyone trying to escape (or, perhaps more urgently, if you see any further children trying to get in). </p> <p>Also, the car comes with a giant band of red reflectors and brake lights, extending the entire width of the back door, and there's another stripped brake light running along the top of the rear window. That's quite some display. When you slow down, planes at 30,000ft are going to know about it. It's like a big, nervous, electric \"Child on board\" sticker. </p> <p>All this, and it isn't even all that ugly. Seen head on, the car looks like the Eurostar - big-nosed, but kind of go-ahead. VW have restyled the bonnet so that it arches up in the middle, but you still, of course, can't see where it ends from the driver's seat, so your ability in particular to park the car successfully depends on the development of a kind of sixth sense about its length (which does, inexplicably, come after a while). </p> <p>Even so, a thrill to own and drive?

Hurley, the first actress to cross the picket, claims she knew nothing about the strike. A spokesman for her production company, Simian Films, said: \"Elizabeth had no idea anyone was on strike as no one told her.\" Clearly she neither reads the papers or even talks to her fellow thespians.",

      "body": "<p>The voice at the end of the phone sounded dejected. \"Not such a good day for us,\" it said from way inside Michael Green's Carlton empire. What had seemed like a master stroke last November, a merger cooked up with Lord Hollick's United News and Media, has been checked. </p> <p>The two companies, currently considering their next moves, are indeed free to merge. The argument for further consolidation of ITV has been won - but at a pretty high price. There will have to be two equally powerful and balanced groups, not a single United/Carlton controlling three of the biggest licences and bossing the rest of the regional tiddlers. Granada has spoiled the party. </p> <p>The highest price will be disposing of, arguably, the juiciest bit of Clive Hollick's empire, the Meridian franchise based in Southampton, which serves the rich south coast. It is the core of United, which Granada (or anyone else) could now buy. </p> <p>Those who are close to the competition commission's inquiry were saying on Friday: \"Hats off to Granada. They have played a blinder. It is their day.\" So much so that the Granada camp was initially \"pleasantly surprised\" by the report. Clearly caught napping by the merger announcement last year, it has fought its way back into the game - first by announcing its intention to bid for either of its rivals. Next it pushed for the whole merger issue to be referred for scrutiny, while grouping its media companies into a single quoted business, Granada Media, with its catering business in a separate arm. Now it is emerging from months of purdah with a big cash war chest and the advantage. </p> <p>Chief executive Charles Allen has been handed the initiative by the competition commission with permission to bid for either target, United or Carlton, subject only to the ownership restraints of the broadcasting act (these prevent it breaching audience share limits or - since it owns LWT - acquiring Carlton's London weekday licence). \"We are well placed to lead the consolidation of ITV,\" said Allen on Friday afternoon with all the satisfaction of a cat savouring a bowl of cream. </p> <p>The chances are that Granada's top team, headed by Allen, with non-executive directors such as the former BSkyB executive David Chance on hand, will act fast, within 21 days, and won't want to be forced onto the back foot a second time. It can make a hostile bid for one, and then make disposals. Or do nothing (unlikely). Or it could negotiate a carve-up: by getting agreement to buy Meridian from a merging Carlton/United as the price for suspending hostilities. </p> <p>How did it win through? The central point in its closely guarded submission was success in convincing the commission that if the merger went ahead three of the four leading and fastest-growing ITV franchises, between them taking 55% of (net) advertising revenue - Carlton, Central and Meridian, with Granada's LWT the fourth - would be in the same hands. </p> <p>These big four are in the midlands and south, and their importance was based on economic analysis. They serve areas, Granada argued, where advertisers were prepared to pay a premium, which meant they would continue to pull ahead. It was, in other words, a convincing way of expressing something more visceral, the fear that a Carlton/United merger would create a north/south TV divide, excluding Granada. This point was expressed cleverly in precisely the right kind of economic terms which the competition commission could address, although it weighed most heavily on the minds of northern MPs who have been resolute in backing Granada's interests. </p> <p>There has been some smart lobbying going on by a team which also defeated the controversial digital BBC licence fee proposal earlier this year. Smart, because Meridian actually accounts for a relatively modest 6.9% of net total advertising, compared with Central (at 10%), Carlton (9.5%) and LWT (7.2%). Granada, based in Manchester, has a 6% share, not so far adrift from Meridian - indeed, you could argue that there is a \"big five\" in ITV rather than a \"big four\". </p> <p>And there's also the issue of programming. The Carlton/United lobby argued that Granada's takeover plans pose another kind of dominance, in programme supply. Its franchises, Granada, LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, are ITV's top three programme-makers, supplying 48% of the network's original productions. But the risks of a merged company's interests unduly influencing programming choice were judged not great enough to operate against the national interest by the commission. </p> <p>So Granada's creative strength emerges from the inquiry unchallenged. This is what makes the report so clever and politically acceptable. It delighted the Department of Culture and even some staunch opponents. </p> <p>\"I think the competition commission has been pretty sensible,\" says David Scott, managing director of Channel 4, who lobbied against the initial plan. \"It's fantastic news for Granada,\" says a senior ITV Network source. \"[trade and industry secretary] Stephen Byers didn't want to go down in history as the man who destroyed ITV,\" says another ITV insider. \"Granada is special. It is trusted and has a track record.\" </p> <p>In contrast, United is still building its programme-making base under the respected leadership of former Channel 4 director of programmes, John Willis, while Carlton's recent problems of quality control, combined with a general failure to match high profits with high programming standards, have not helped. </p> <p>Granada's creative strength makes it by far the most important ITV player. It made eight of ITV's 10 top-rated programmes last year (excluding sports coverage). Overall, 30% of the UK's top-rated programmes came from its studios in 1999. Last week it pulled off a further coup, with ITV announcing that Yorkshire's Emmerdale would be running five nights a week from the autumn. </p> <p>Granada is, however, far from being a relaxed company for creative types to work in contentedly. \"If editors and department heads lose orders, then they have to make people redundant,\" an insider explains. \"There is huge attention to the bottom line. The control of costs is ruthless.\" That's why so many respected programme-makers leave after a while, another executive adds, \"they don't like the notion of profits regardless\". None the less, Granada's studios continue to deliver because of a long tradition which has given it strength and focus. \"I have huge admiration for it,\" says a leading competitor ruefully. \"Especially when you consider the state it was in.\" </p> <p>The current management, led by Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen, gained control of Granada in 1992, much to the old guard's horror. It was the oldest and grandest of ITV companies, but still a small, over-manned regional franchise, overly focused on ITV. </p> <p>Eight years later, Granada Media has transformed itself into a bigger player, through acquisition and organic growth, with international interests and a half share in ONdigital which serves more than 700,000 homes. In 1994 it acquired LWT through a bitter-resisted hostile bid and gained a foothold in London for the first time, and a slate of weekend entertainment programmes. Since acquisition, LWT programme sales to all channels have risen by 54%. Ailing Yorkshire-Tyne Tees (acquired in 1997) has also flourished, reversing a decline in advertising. </p> <p>The fact that this creative critical mass looks set to grow is good news for viewers. But the commission's verdict is bad news for ad agencies and advertisers, who wanted to stick with the current divided system. \"No attention has been paid to the people who pay the money. We are disappointed,\" says Nick Phillips of the agencies' trade body, the IPA. \"It reinforces our view that we don't have a voice at the table. We will be lobbying to enshrine a 'duty of care' for advertisers in the wording,\" says Bob Wootton of ISBA, the advertisers' organisation. </p> <p>The commission has removed the 25% rule which prevents any company controlling more than a quarter of the TV advertising market, thereby allowing airtime sales in future to be controlled by two operations. And nothing has been put in its place - just a clear indication that ITV is to have two balancing sales forces. </p> <p>Despite the talk of a single ITV company on the horizon, the one - sizeable - crumb of comfort is that the report states it may be five years or more before ITV's share of TV advertising drops to 50%.

      "body": "<p>Stage one of the consolidation of ITV got off to a ripping start last week, when the DTI announced the results of the competition commission's inquiry into the various bids by Granada, United and Carlton to be the ultimate winner of a single Channel 3. And we were left in no doubt as to the first stage winner: Granada Media Group. The report reads very nearly like Granada's own submission to the commission, accepting virtually every argument put forward by the owner of LWT, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and Granada Television. That leaves Granada in the yellow jersey, able to take control on its own of the next stages that should see ITV under single ownership within two or so years. </p> <p>To recap: last November, Carlton and United announced their intention to merge, which would create a TV powerhouse owning Carlton, Central and Westcountry (Carlton's licences) and Meridian, Anglia and HTV (United's franchises). Granada, at first wrong-footed by the announcement, went on the offensive, declaring that it would bid for either United or Carlton rather than see its two arch-rivals achieve a friendly merger. </p> <p>Since then, we have been in waiting mode. Because every permutation of merger or takeover would have been illegal under one or another set of rules, the whole business had to be reviewed by the commission. There was never any chance that the primary restraint on consolidation, the ceiling of 15% of total TV audience, would be lifted this side of a new broadcasting bill. However, the other major constraint - the limit of 25% of airtime advertising sales - was a different matter. It was based on a set of informal undertakings with the office of fair trading, and could be lifted without primary legislation. That would free Carlton and United to merge, and would allow Granada to own either of its two rivals, provided it sold enough franchises to move below the 15% ceiling on audience. </p> <p>In the end, the expected result was duly delivered. Yes, says the commission, the airtime sales limit will be abolished. But there was a wrinkle. Accepting verbatim the Granada argument, the commission said that no company should be allowed to control more than two \"premium\" ITV licences. Premium means any licence that sells airtime at a premium to the ITV average, and only four franchises - Carlton, Central, LWT and Meridian - fall into that camp. </p> <p>So in order to merge, Carlton and United would have to sell Meridian. Granada, by contrast, could buy either Carlton or United without special conditions. It would, however, have to abide by the broadcasting act, and keep below 15% of audience share. It would also have to abide by the act's London-split provisions, which prohibit common ownership of the London franchises in the week and at the weekend. </p> <p>So we have the rules laid down. What happens next? Let's take this in order, and apply some logic (an admittedly dangerous thing to do when dealing with the outsized egos and irrationality of ITV chieftains). First, the rationale behind the merger of United and Carlton looks pretty weak if the two have to sell Meridian. Is it really worth all that effort merely to add Anglia and HTV to Carlton's three licences? </p> <p>Let's say the two parties decide to proceed anyway. They could then offer Meridian to Granada (at a suitable premium). But surely Granada's shareholders, who have just stumped up \u00a31.3bn and backed a new listing for the de-merged media side of the old hotels and media conglomerate, deserve more than just one piddling licence for all that support? Granada has made suitably aggressive noises about its natural role as the consolidator of ITV. One licence does not a swaggering predator make. And would United-Carlton even want to sell the licence to Granada? Why not to another player, just to annoy Granada's Charles Allen? </p> <p>It seems more likely to me that Granada will instead force the pace, by bidding for either Carlton or United. It may then extract additional concessions - that is, win more than just Meridian - for its troubles. A bid for United looks tempting on the surface. No problems there with the London split, and a chance to add at least two licences to the Granada stable (although not all three - that pesky broadcasting act gets in the way again). </p> <p>But United is the also-ran in this bunch, and only derives a quarter of its profits from TV. Does Granada really want to waste time trying to find a buyer for the endlessly struggling Express Newspapers or for exhibitions? Also, United is already about as expensive as it can get: how much more than \u00a310 a share does Charles Allen want to justify paying for second best? </p> <p>Finally, why go for the third prize when the second prize is achievable now? The danger of leaving Carlton out at this point is that when the time comes for the ultimate consolidation of two companies into one (and make no mistake, that is where we are heading), Granada will have to deal with a stronger Carlton rather than a weaker United. </p> <p>Of course, there are problems with a bid for Carlton. First, something would have to be done with either LWT or Carlton to meet the conditions of the London split. Second, Granada would also have to sell at least one licence to be below the 15% ceiling under the act. </p> <p>The first hurdle could be handled by selling the licence to a third party (RTL-Pearson, perhaps?) and then buying it back when the rules change. (This would have to be done carefully, to avoid the appearance of \"warehousing\"). Granada could even keep 20% of LWT and still remain within the rules. </p> <p>Although the share prices of the various companies last Friday seemed to suggest a different outcome was being predicted by the City, I still think Carlton is the more logical target for Charles Allen. It derives 50% of its profits from TV, is in the process of selling Technicolor (so Granada would not have to deal with that legacy) and would give Granada a lovely contiguous licence called Central to go with Granada and Yorkshire TV. The stock market, by contrast, marked down Carlton's shares and marked United's up, suggesting a bid for United was the expected outcome. </p> <p>Logic may not always be the prime motivator but my money is still on Carlton being the target in Charles Allen's sights.

The pitch was pretty flat - a very good wicket to bat on - but I think that they bowled pretty well. There wasn't much in it for the seamers, and they lost a spinner early on to injury [Tom Cotterell] so they stuck at it quite well.

      "bodyText": "A male contraceptive pill which is 100% effective and has no unpleasant side effects could be on the market within five years, according to scientists. A team working at Edinburgh University claim to have achieved complete success in international trials. Scientists now hope that the male pill could appear on shelves in the UK in the next five years. Previous attempts to manufacture a male pill have been hampered by severe side effects. These include high blood pressure, weight gain, acne and a loss of sex drive. But scientists working on this latest drug claim to have eradicated them. Trials held in Scotland, South Africa, China and Nigeria have also proved to be successful. Professor David Baird of Edinburgh University's centre for reproductive biology has described the results as \"very encouraging\". The results of the trials will be formally announced at the World Conference for Gynaecologists and Obstetricians in Washington in September. The trials were backed by the Dutch pharmaceutical company Organon. The pill contains a synthetic steroid, desogestrel, which inhibits sperm production. Its other main ingredient is the male sex hormone, testosterone, to counteract the loss of sex drive. A male pill would provide an alternative to vasectomy or female sterilisation. It would also provide an option for those couples worried about the health implications of the female contraceptive pill. In 1995 the government's medical advisers warned that women taking the \"third generation\" pills ran double the risk of developing potentially fatal blood clots. But the Catholic church in Scotland was quick to condemn the latest development. A spokesman said: \"As far as we are concerned any form of artificial contraception is wrong - a male pill would be as wrong as a female pill.\" He warned that the development of a male pill could lead to a more relaxed attitude to abortion and marriage which in turn could lead to an increased number of unplanned pregnancies.",

      "bodyText": "Yesterday morning on GMTV, both Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe denied they were involved in a Dutch auction to capture the populist law and order vote. However, the extraordinary leak only 15 hours later of a memo from the prime minister's own computer suggest the opposite is the case. The leak seriously rattled Downing Street simply because it had to confront the possibility that the administration is defenceless in the face of a computer hacker, or a fifth columnist in the prime minister's closest entourage. A Downing Street spokesman conceded that the leak was spectacular, but insisted the document did not reveal any fundamental calumny or deceit by Mr Blair. The spokesman claimed the memo dealt with a set of issues and concerns the prime minister had largely addressed, including crime, especially rural crime, defence spending, support for the family and finally the freeing up of the time of Mr Blair's spokesman Alastair Campbell to devote more energy to assembling a consistent message on formerly core Tory issues. Nevertheless, the memo also reveals the speed with which Mr Blair became privately rattled by the sudden ability of William Hague, after years in the doldrums, to capture touchstone rightwing issues in a way which left the government looking apologetic and flat footed. Mr Hague finally found his political voice when on April 26 he sided with the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin when he was found guilty of murdering a burglar. Mr Hague followed up with calls for detention camps for all asylum seekers and demands that drug pushers near school gates be jailed for life. He also proposed scrapping the early release of prisoners. Mr Hague admitted privately that he had decided to give up making worthy and unreported speeches on the environment. He was going to go for topical issues and give vent to the instincts of the core Tory vote. In public, Mr Blair accused him of being opportunistic, suffering poor judgment or advocating lynch law. In private, Mr Blair was demanding a counter-attack, implicitly venting his frustration at the home secretary, Jack Straw, for failing to deliver tough messages. Philip Gould, the party's private pollster, and Mr Blair have always watched hawkeyed for any sign that they were losing the traditionally Tory ground which they and New Labour had spectacularly colonised before the 1997 election. Mr Blair repeatedly told allies of the advice given to him by Bill Clinton, who claimed his party's political success had been based on giving special attention to the new voters lured to the Democrat cause in 1992. Any suggestion that the Tories were making a comeback in the fields of defence, the family, asylum or crime would have alarmed Blair. Other leaks from the computer of Mr Gould to Mr Blair, mainly written at the time of the local elections, suggest Mr Blair was being advised that Mr Hague had struck a chord. Despite the attacks from the left, suggesting Mr Blair was ignoring his core vote and the heartlands, the memo reveals him more preoccupied with protecting his political right. The Downing Street policy response to the Hague revival is now relatively clear. Sir Charles Guthrie, the chief of defence staff, has been told the Ministry of Defence will have above inflation rises in this week's spending round. A story was leaked at the week end suggesting Mr Blair had personally authorised the increases. On asylum, Mr Straw - who admitted yesterday it has been the most difficult political issue confronting him - has been forced to make as much as possible of the recent fall in the asylum backlog led by the increase in asylum decisions. On family issues, Mr Blair has let it be known he will not be expecting quick implementation on proposals to give gays new rights in the imminent sexual offences review. He also called a police summit to discuss ways to tackle burglary. The initiative backfired badly when he proposed drunks should be frogmarched to cash machines to pay on the spot fines, an idea rejected by chief constables as barmy.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>Touchstone issues</b> <p>There are a clutch of issues - seemingly disparate - that are in fact linked. We need a strategy that is almost discrete, focussed on them. They are roughly combining \"on your side\" issues with toughness and standing up for Britain. They range from: the family - where, partly due to MCA (married couples' tax allowance) and to gay issues, we are perceived as weak; asylum and crime where we are perceived as soft; and asserting the nation's interests where, because of the unpopularity of Europe, a constant barrage of small stories beginning to add up on defence and even issues like Zimbabwe, we are seen as insufficiently assertive. </p> <p>All this, of course, is perception. It is bizarre that any government I lead should be seen as anti-family. We are, in fact, taking very tough measures on asylum and crime. Kosovo should have laid to rest any doubts about our strength in defence. But all these things add up to a sense that the government - and this even applies to me - are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts. </p> <p>The Martin case - and the lack of any response from us that appeared to empathise with public concern and then channel it into the correct course - has only heightened this problem. </p> <p>We need a thoroughly worked out strategy, stretching over several months, to regain the initiative in this area. Each of these issues should be analysed and the correct policy response drawn up. Then each should be dealt with, but with a message that ties it all together. This is precisely the sort of thing AC and CF [Alastair Campbell and Charles Falconer] should do if a new system is put in place which frees up their time. </p> <p><b>My thoughts are:</b> </p> <p>i) Possibly on the Martin case, asking a senior judge to look at changing the sentencing law, ie to allow lesser sentences than life. We also need far tougher rebuttal or alternatively action, re the allegations that jurors were intimidated. </p> <p>ii) On asylum, we need to be highlighting removals and decisions plus if the April figures show a reduction, then a downward trend. Also if the benefits bills really start to fall, that should be highlighted. Plus some of the genuine asylum claims should be given some publicity. </p> <p>iii) On crime we need to highlight the tough measures: compulsory tests for drugs before bail; the PIU (Performance Innovation Unit) report on the confiscation of assets; the extra number of burglars jailed under \"three strikes and you're out\". Above all, we must deal now with street crime, especially in London. When the figures are published for the six months to April, they will show a small, 4%, rise in crime. But this will almost entirely be due to the rise in levels of street crime - mobile phones, bags being snatched. This will be worst in London. The Met police are putting in place measures to deal with it; but as ever we lack a tough public message along with the strategy. We should think now of an initiative, eg locking up street muggers. Something tough, with immediate bite, which sends a message through the system. Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders. But this should be done soon, and I, personally, should be associated with it. </p> <p>iv) On defence, we need to make the CSR (Comprehensive Spending Review) work for defence. Big cuts and you can forget any hope of winning back ground on \"standing up for Britain\". </p> <p>v) On the family, we need two or three eye-catching initiatives that are entirely conventional in terms of their attitude to the family. Despite the rubbish about gay couples, the adoption issue worked well. We need more. </p> <p>I should be personally associated with as much of this as possible. </p> <p>TB 29 April 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Touchstone issues There are a clutch of issues - seemingly disparate - that are in fact linked. We need a strategy that is almost discrete, focussed on them. They are roughly combining \"on your side\" issues with toughness and standing up for Britain. They range from: the family - where, partly due to MCA (married couples' tax allowance) and to gay issues, we are perceived as weak; asylum and crime where we are perceived as soft; and asserting the nation's interests where, because of the unpopularity of Europe, a constant barrage of small stories beginning to add up on defence and even issues like Zimbabwe, we are seen as insufficiently assertive. All this, of course, is perception. It is bizarre that any government I lead should be seen as anti-family. We are, in fact, taking very tough measures on asylum and crime. Kosovo should have laid to rest any doubts about our strength in defence. But all these things add up to a sense that the government - and this even applies to me - are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts. The Martin case - and the lack of any response from us that appeared to empathise with public concern and then channel it into the correct course - has only heightened this problem. We need a thoroughly worked out strategy, stretching over several months, to regain the initiative in this area. Each of these issues should be analysed and the correct policy response drawn up. Then each should be dealt with, but with a message that ties it all together. This is precisely the sort of thing AC and CF [Alastair Campbell and Charles Falconer] should do if a new system is put in place which frees up their time. My thoughts are: i) Possibly on the Martin case, asking a senior judge to look at changing the sentencing law, ie to allow lesser sentences than life. We also need far tougher rebuttal or alternatively action, re the allegations that jurors were intimidated. ii) On asylum, we need to be highlighting removals and decisions plus if the April figures show a reduction, then a downward trend. Also if the benefits bills really start to fall, that should be highlighted. Plus some of the genuine asylum claims should be given some publicity. iii) On crime we need to highlight the tough measures: compulsory tests for drugs before bail; the PIU (Performance Innovation Unit) report on the confiscation of assets; the extra number of burglars jailed under \"three strikes and you're out\". Above all, we must deal now with street crime, especially in London. When the figures are published for the six months to April, they will show a small, 4%, rise in crime. But this will almost entirely be due to the rise in levels of street crime - mobile phones, bags being snatched. This will be worst in London. The Met police are putting in place measures to deal with it; but as ever we lack a tough public message along with the strategy. We should think now of an initiative, eg locking up street muggers. Something tough, with immediate bite, which sends a message through the system. Maybe, the driving licence penalty for young offenders. But this should be done soon, and I, personally, should be associated with it. iv) On defence, we need to make the CSR (Comprehensive Spending Review) work for defence. Big cuts and you can forget any hope of winning back ground on \"standing up for Britain\". v) On the family, we need two or three eye-catching initiatives that are entirely conventional in terms of their attitude to the family. Despite the rubbish about gay couples, the adoption issue worked well. We need more. I should be personally associated with as much of this as possible. TB 29 April 2000",

      "bodyText": "William Hague has angered Tory councillors in his constituency with a speech mistakenly criticising them for spending thousands of pounds on unnecessary repairs to a school. The Conservative leader scored an own goal when he accused his local education authority in North Yorkshire of spending \u00a398,000 to replace sound windows at a school in his Richmond constituency, instead of using the money to save the job of a teacher who was to be made redundant next term. He was rebuked by a senior Tory councillor and by the headteacher of Romanby county primary school, in Northallerton, and told to get his facts right in future - but Mr Hague went ahead with the remarks, in his keynote speech earlier this month to launch the Tories' education policy, promising to abolish education authorities (LEAs) and allow schools to decide how to spend their budgets. Mr Hague told an audience at the rightwing thinktank Politeia that a school in his constituency was \"being forced to lose a teacher this year because of budget cuts\" and that the school would \"much rather\" spend the \u00a398,000 on retaining the teacher than on an upgrade for all its windows which, he said, had \"nothing wrong\" with them and would \"last another 20 years at least\". Romanby's head teacher, Jeff Featonby, and the Tory chair of North Yorkshire county council's education committee, John Dennis, both wrote to Mr Hague to ask him to \"set the record straight\" and urged him to withdraw his remarks. In an exchange of letters seen by the Guardian, Mr Dennis explained that the windows were needed to replace 50-year-old leaking metal frames, and that the school needed fewer teachers as pupil numbers were falling. Mr Dennis, in a letter dated July 4, the day of the speech, and faxed to Mr Hague's Commons office, explained that the \u00a398,000 grant to replace the windows came from the government's new deal for schools capital investment scheme, and was \"a result of a successful bid which the LEA made on behalf of the school\" and \"therefore not from an LEA budget which could be potentially delegated to schools\". Mr Dennis also pointed out that, despite Mr Hague's claims, a senior maintenance officer had confirmed that the windows were in urgent need of replacing, as the single-glazed metal frames dating from the 1950s leaked, causing \"considerable heat loss\" and \"significant condensation problems\", while the \"twisted hinges and insecure catches\" posed a security risk. The councillor's letter came in response to an advance of Mr Hague's speech, and to a letter sent by the Tory leader some days earlier to David Ashton, Tory leader of North Yorkshire county council, complaining about the repairs. Mr Hague wrote: \"I appreciate the education budget is under pressure but cases like this are hard to explain to constituents and reflect badly on the county and its school.\" Mick Haigh, leader of the Labour group on the council, last night demanded a full explanation for the \"blunder\" and said he planned to call on Mr Hague to apologise to the school's teachers, pupils and their parents at Wednesday's council meeting. Mr Haigh said: \"We don't want to intrude on a private Tory war, but Mr Hague's constituents deserve an explanation.\"",

One possible explanation for the age distribution is that young people tend to eat these products more than the adult population.\"</p> <p>Prof Will was not available yesterday but the Department of Health said: \"There is nothing new in this. Everyone has been well aware for a long time that reprocessed meat was a potential means of transmission.</p> <p>\"Scientific research continues. Reprocessed meat was used in a very wide variety of feedstuffs, certainly not babyfood and school meals. Nobody should be in any doubt there is no risk now from these things.\"</p> <p>The US investigations involving 376 sheep could take several years. Four were found to have a BSE-like disease which could be a new form of scrapie, a sheep disease long endemic in Britain, but not known to be dangerous to humans.</p> <p>The tests will be conducted at a secure facility at Plum Island, near New York. The animals were dairy sheep imported from Belgium and the Netherlands in 1996 and their milk, and cheese made from it, has been sold for some time. Their lambs have also been sold for food.</p> <p>Britain has banned some parts of sheep, including the head, from entering food for some years but is slightly relaxing controls as a trade-off for EU-wide measures.</p> <p>Scrapie is increasing in Britain, with nearly 600 cases reported last year. The actual incidence may be eight times as high. It is mostly identified in older sheep.</p>",

Three flocks quarantined in the state of Vermont are being destroyed under the orders of the US agriculture department which has begun tests to establish whether the disease believed to have spread to humans has also transferred to sheep. Scientists in Britain have long feared this is possible, although the disease has been successfully introduced to sheep only in laboratory tests. Now experts working for the government have commissioned a risk assessment to quantify the threat to human health if BSE were found in Britain's 40m sheep. From January, all sheep will have to be tagged as part of European Union measures to track major diseases.

But whatever they discover we will look at with interest.\" Government officials are trying to quantify the costs of a human epidemic of variant CJD, linked to eating beef from infected cattle years ago, which has so far claimed 67 lives in Britain with at least eight other victims probably suffering from the fatal condition. Experts are worried by a rise in cases in recent months, and are investigating an apparent cluster involving five people, four of whom have died, around the Leicestershire village of Queniborough. Members of the main scientific advisory committee in BSE and variant CJD are meeting to discuss both issues today. News of the US investigations emerged as Robert Will, head of the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh, reiterated his fears that the high proportion of young victims resulted from their exposure to foods containing mechanically recovered meat used in baby foods, pates, beefburgers, pies, sausages and other dishes often on school meal menus. Many risky materials from cattle were banned from food in 1989, although enforcement of the restrictions is thought to have been poor. But mechanically recovered meat, known as MRM, machined off animal bones, was not banned until 1995. Professor Will told the Independent on Sunday: \"Foodstuffs which contained that material could be particularly dangerous. One possible explanation for the age distribution is that young people tend to eat these products more than the adult population.\" Prof Will was not available yesterday but the Department of Health said: \"There is nothing new in this. Everyone has been well aware for a long time that reprocessed meat was a potential means of transmission. \"Scientific research continues. Reprocessed meat was used in a very wide variety of feedstuffs, certainly not babyfood and school meals. Nobody should be in any doubt there is no risk now from these things.\" The US investigations involving 376 sheep could take several years. Four were found to have a BSE-like disease which could be a new form of scrapie, a sheep disease long endemic in Britain, but not known to be dangerous to humans. The tests will be conducted at a secure facility at Plum Island, near New York. The animals were dairy sheep imported from Belgium and the Netherlands in 1996 and their milk, and cheese made from it, has been sold for some time. Their lambs have also been sold for food. Britain has banned some parts of sheep, including the head, from entering food for some years but is slightly relaxing controls as a trade-off for EU-wide measures. Scrapie is increasing in Britain, with nearly 600 cases reported last year. The actual incidence may be eight times as high. It is mostly identified in older sheep.",

      "bodyText": "A Parachute Regiment officer landed back in Britain last night praising the dramatic weekend operation in which he and more than 200 other UN observers and soldiers were rescued from a rebel siege in Sierra Leone by forces acting on directions from SAS teams and backed by Chinook helicopters. The operation by UN and British forces was \"extremely professional and extremely swift - it's of great credit to the people involved\", Major Andrew Harrison said after being reunited with his wife Carolyn and two small daughters at RAF Northolt, west of London. An unarmed UN observer monitoring the notional peace peace between Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front rebels and government, Maj Harrison was taken captive by the RUF in early May along with 10 other observers. Soon after, they were sent to a UN base at Kailahun where 222 Indian troops of the Unamsil peacekeeping operation were surrounded by the rebels. Maj Harrison said that the day before Saturday's land and air operation, the rescuers messaged him at the base on his satellite phone to tell him what was about to happen. \"For weeks people had been trying to negotiate the freedom of movement for the Kailahun company and without success,\" he said last night. \"Of course I can't be objective but I felt it was time for action and indeed swift and decisive action was taken.\" He said the rescue helicopters touched down for about 30 seconds. Guided by SAS spotters who had been covertly monitoring the rebels, Indian helicopters and British Chinooks - the latter said to be in Sierra Leone to help train government troops - picked up the military observers and flew them to Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. They also brought out more than two dozen peacekeepers from the Indian garrison who were suffering from illness. The rest of Unamsil's 222-strong Indian contingent left Kailahun by road and was said last night to have got safely to another UN base at Datu after encountering some shooting on the road. The main fighting was done by a ground force of Nigerian, Indian and Ghanaian soldiers that moved in on the rebels at Kailahun backed by the helicopters. The troops inflicted an unspecified number of casualties in clashes with the rebels. There were also reports that the two British Chinooks involved had encountered some shooting when they landed. Geoff Hoon, Britain's defence secretary, had agreed to a Unamsil request for help to lift a siege that had lasted for more than 10 weeks at the Indian garrison. The Conservative party's defence spokesman, Robert Key, said: \"We congratulate the government on what we know must have been a difficult decision.\" The Unamsil commander, Major-General Vijay Jetley, has been criticised for letting the rebels run rings round the UN forces in Sierra Leone. The rebels had been adopting an \"increasingly threatening posture,\" UN secretary general Kofi Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said on Saturday: \"The use of force by Unamsil to extract its personnel from the area had become inevitable.\" Maj Harrison, 33, said that when he was first abducted he was threatened physically and verbally by the rebels. After her husband's RAF jet landed at Northolt last night, Mrs Harrison said: \"It has been a very long 10 and a half weeks and under the circumstances it has been very stressful for myself and all of the family. We are a very close family and every one has felt it very hard.\" During Maj Harrison's time trapped at the base, he had also been able to keep in contact with his wife by satphone and email. Three other Britons taken captive at the same time - Major Phil Ashby, Major Andrew Samsonoff and Lieutenant-Commander Paul Rowland - managed to escape in a jungle trek in May. Mr Hoon welcomed what he called the \"decisive action\" by Unamsil but insisted that the British forces involved - including soldiers of the Royal Anglian Regiment - had been under national command. Gen Jetley, the Unamsil commander, told reporters at his base in Daru: \"The men were not only rescued, they were also rescued with all the weapons they had in their possession.\" In recent months some Unamsil units menaced by the RUF had simply turned over their arms and vehicles. The rebels suffered \"serious casualties\" on Saturday during fighting with the Ghanaian troops, according to Major Arun Anthanarayan, an officer attached to Unamsil. Peacekeepers later leaving Kailahun by road also shot back at rebels attacking them. Gen Jetley maintained that the UN force, which is close to its authorised strength of 13,000 - making it the UN's biggest current peacekeeping operation - would continue to operate throughout the west African country. \"It is our mandate for us to deploy, but this time we will have to do it in a robust manner because of our past experience,\" he said.

That has resulted partly from privatisation but also the large reduction in council house building.

Mr Winsor is to add to Railtrack's problems by insisting that the project must still be completed by 2005. In a call for more money for the rail system, the Engineering Employers' Federation notes that spends only 1% of GDP on transport, compared with Germany's 2% and the 2.4% of Italy.",

      "body": "<p>One of the most successful and popular museums in the north-west unveils its dramatic new look today after years of planning. <br><br>Modern glass and steel edifices have been added to former railway buildings which date back to the 1830s and now form the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. Work began on the final phase of development in March 1999 after the museum secured \u00a38.8m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. <br><br>As part of the project a collections centre has been completed, which is due to open next year. It aims to improve visitors' access to the collections and ensure exhibits are better managed. <br><br> The glass-fronted entrance and reception area has a large metal sphere and cone sculpture outside; it symbolises the museum and forms part of its logo. <br><br>There is also a new shop and Warehouse for the World - an evocative sound and light show. As visitors enter the museum, television screens show them what they can expect to see.<br><br> The culture secretary, Chris Smith, and the chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund, Eric Anderson, will visit Castlefields today.<br><br> Patrick Greene, director of the museum, said the launch was the culmination of two decades of work. \"The process of rescue, repair and adaption of five major historic buildings has been a painstaking one,\" he said. \"This project could not have been undertaken without the enormous support from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Heritage Lottery Fund. <br><br> \"They have enabled us to achieve in the last four years what we thought it would have taken at least 15 years to achieve at the present rate of fundraising. It has made a difference in that the museum is now more accessible to people and it is a real place for people who live in this city to visit.\" He said it was a thrill to see a process which started almost two decades ago come to fruition. <br><br>Dr Greene believes the Museum of Science and Industry is now one of the top six science museums in the world. <br><br>Last year it attracted 364,000 visitors, making it one of the top 10 pay for entry museums in Britain. \"It is the first time we have been in the top 10,\" Dr Greene said. \"Although we have been in the top 20 for a few years now. We want to make the experience of coming to our museum habit forming.\" <br><br>Visitors come from all over the world and the museum is also popular with school parties across the north-west.

      "bodyText": "One of the most successful and popular museums in the north-west unveils its dramatic new look today after years of planning. Modern glass and steel edifices have been added to former railway buildings which date back to the 1830s and now form the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. Work began on the final phase of development in March 1999 after the museum secured \u00a38.8m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. As part of the project a collections centre has been completed, which is due to open next year. It aims to improve visitors' access to the collections and ensure exhibits are better managed. The glass-fronted entrance and reception area has a large metal sphere and cone sculpture outside; it symbolises the museum and forms part of its logo. There is also a new shop and Warehouse for the World - an evocative sound and light show. As visitors enter the museum, television screens show them what they can expect to see. The culture secretary, Chris Smith, and the chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund, Eric Anderson, will visit Castlefields today. Patrick Greene, director of the museum, said the launch was the culmination of two decades of work. \"The process of rescue, repair and adaption of five major historic buildings has been a painstaking one,\" he said. \"This project could not have been undertaken without the enormous support from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Heritage Lottery Fund. \"They have enabled us to achieve in the last four years what we thought it would have taken at least 15 years to achieve at the present rate of fundraising. It has made a difference in that the museum is now more accessible to people and it is a real place for people who live in this city to visit.\" He said it was a thrill to see a process which started almost two decades ago come to fruition. Dr Greene believes the Museum of Science and Industry is now one of the top six science museums in the world. Last year it attracted 364,000 visitors, making it one of the top 10 pay for entry museums in Britain. \"It is the first time we have been in the top 10,\" Dr Greene said. \"Although we have been in the top 20 for a few years now. We want to make the experience of coming to our museum habit forming.\" Visitors come from all over the world and the museum is also popular with school parties across the north-west. The average visitor spends four hours there. The museum is made up of five former railway buildings linked on a seven acre site which used to house the world's first passenger railway station. The platform is still there and from next spring trains will operate along a short track. As part of the extension, the museum's cramped restaurant has been replaced by a huge open-plan contemporary structure which can accommodate 200 people. It was officially opened in February by Loyd Grossman, who is one of the museum's trustees. Dr Greene believes the modern restaurant with its wooden floors blends in well with the historic buildings. Next to the restaurant, a dramatic glass lift and staircase tower have been installed at the end of the main building. It boasts panoramic views of Manchester and Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United football club. Former railway warehouses, which until 18 months ago were semi-derelict, have been completely refurbished. The new buildings have been designed by architects from the north-west and they will make the museum's reserve collections more accessible to the public, who will be able to see what is going on behind the scenes through large glass windows. When new objects enter the museum they will be photographed and catalogued in full view of the visitors. Dr Greene said the idea was that visitors could window shop behind the scenes. A rusty old motorbike from 1924 manufactured by Manchester-based Dot (Devoid of trouble) was being catalogued and restored in one of the new buildings. It is a painstaking process which will probably take several months to complete. A warehouse from 1830, the oldest railway building in the world, has been transformed into an audiovisual centre. A film aims to give visitors a snapshot of life in the 19th century in the industrial city. It includes a haunting and ironic song, Manchester's Improving Daily, with lyrics about the air being too thick to breathe. The building was restored in 1996 but has been fitted out with money from the lottery grant with a modern reception area and the Futures exhibition on the third floor. The exhibition celebrates how new technology has changed lives and boosted industry in Manchester. But there is still work to be done. Over the next few years, new galleries will be created once funding is available. Dr Greene said: \"When I first came here 17 years ago we had just 12 staff and lots of empty semi-derelict buildings. Now we have got 112 staff and we just keep moving forward.\"",

      "trailText": "Another week, another Clare Short 'gaffe'. This time she has described the Catholic church as 'stuck and wrong'. But in a world uneasy with spin, could she be the perfect politician?",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Clare Short, the secretary of state for international development, used to have a Great Dane called Fred (\"so he didn't get any illusions of grandeur\"), but he died and wasn't replaced. She's trying to persuade her mother to have a dog now, a spaniel perhaps, that Short would walk when she goes home to Birmingham at weekends - but she won't \"because of what it would do in the garden\". Short looks mournful when she tells me this.</p> <p>\"Dogs are nice,\" she says, \"and they teach you how you should be with your friends. They always love you unconditionally. You shout at them and two minutes later they love you again and therefore you love them. And if human beings were like that to each other we'd all be a lot happier.\"</p> <p>Clare Short is, you might say, the Fred of the Labour party, always being shouted at, always bounding back. Everyone waits for \"the Clare Gaffe\", the blowing of the Short fuse; anticipates the rebuke, the tap on the nose; then smiles happily when there seem to be no hard feelings all round. Take her past advocation of higher tax \"for people like me\" or her attack on Blair's \"men in the dark\", or last week's comments on the Catholic church's opposition to contraception (\"stuck and wrong\", \"just another burden\" in the fight against Aids). Hardly had an hour gone by before the prime minister's office issued a statement distancing itself from Short's \"personal\" views: \"Blair chides Short\" read the headlines. But then it all seemed to end as quickly as it began. \"There is absolutely no difference between me and Tony Blair on HIV/Aids,\" Short tells me doggedly, \"and there was no rebuke.\"</p> <p>We meet in her office in Victoria where a secretary carries around an \"out of order\" sign to secure the lift in case Short needs it. It's a tatty building, as it should be when your brief is to help the poorest of the poor, but Short seems on top of the world here, striding down the long corridors in her swishy black trousers and heels, two steps ahead of her aides, queen of all she surveys. She is full of beans, says there is nothing she could be doing that was \"more important, more needy... more noble. Don't tell the others,\" she adds with a laugh, \"but this is definitely the best job in government.\" At the suggestion, though, that it was canny of the prime minister to have given it to her, to have funnelled her passions and convictions in that direction, she is suddenly quite crisp. \"What I resist,\" she says, \"is that I'm the sort of person only this would do for. I've had that all my life. It's partly to do with being a woman, it's partly to do with really believing what I believe in. People think that means you haven't got a good brain - a woman who feels passionately presumably doesn't do all the analysis.\"</p> <p>She is a big woman in the flesh, an elegant 54 with long legs and a broad chest. The cheekbones on her face with its Aztec features and ruddy complexion are so high they bump her eyes. She is much grander than you expect, majestic even. She is strident, wonderfully articulate, on the subjects of globalisation and international investment agreements, on the increase of literacy, the decrease of mortality. Only when she gives a throaty guffaw and kicks off her shoes do you realise she's wearing pop socks. Only when she relaxes, when she's talking about dogs and family, do you really notice the Birmingham accent.</p> <p>In a world uneasy with spin, Short is a still point, a haven in a storm. She might even, in the current climate, be the perfect politician. \"I'm not sure that all my colleagues would agree,\" she says at that. \"To be honest I never could talk the soundbites. I just can't bear it. It offends me intellectually.\" She thinks in retrospect that spin may have been justified in 1997 -\"If standing on our heads and waggling our toes in the air would have made us win we'd all have done it\" - but that they should have been more confident earlier. \"I think the country is in tune with our real values and we could have been more straight about what we're doing.\" Only the press, she believes, is \"is still obsessed with spin over substance\", driven - last week being a case in point - by \"the need to report drama and clashes\". She has often had a bad time in the papers, \"when you're ripped apart in front of all those people who don't know you,\" most notably during her campaign against page three girls.</p> <p>\"If I had known the price you pay in media terms and all that personal stuff I don't think I would have had the courage to [go into politics] at all,\" she says.</p> <p>She finds the House of Commons can be \"very silly\". People no longer snigger when cervical cancer is mentioned as they did when she first became MP for Birmingham Ladywood in 1983, but prime minister's question time is a trial.</p> <p>\"Once a month Tony comes on after me and I sit there and think, 'Good heavens!' Well, it's so... so schoolboyish. It is. It really is. And I think, 'God, I've got to keep a sensible face because people will think I'm frowning at what Tony's saying, and I'm not. I'm thinking, 'What a wallyish way of organising our country!'\"</p> <p>As for Blair's perceived phoniness: \"I said to Alastair [Campbell], 'It's time you put Tony out on the media now.' People have begun to think he's so awful that if they see the real him they'll like him. He's a very different kind of character to me - well, he's a man - but there is a large part of him that is completely genuine and absolutely straight. People just need to hear him being practical and informed and just knowing what he's doing.\"</p> <p>She believes in openness and she has always talked about the big things in her personal life. She gave extremely moving interviews about the death from Alzheimer's in 1993 of her husband, the former Labour minister Alex Lyon. And she was very careful three years later to manage, in media terms, the reunion with Toby, the son she gave up for adoption when she was 18, and who had contacted her when he was a 31-year-old solicitor with Tory leanings.</p> <p>Even now she has firmly prepared things to say about it. She says she has to be careful, for both their sakes. \"I've always been a kind of optimist and I've always liked people but since I've got Toby back it's like a completion of my fundamental happiness. I always had a bit of pain in me and that's healed, so I'm happier than I probably deserve to be. You know, profoundly in a way. And he's completely gorgeous - I love him to bits.\"</p> <p>But if you ask her more questions she does start to falter a little. When I wondered if she regretted that Toby had never met Alex, she says, \"I haven't, you see, because then I wish . . . or you know you go back and unwish all the bad things ... Obviously I wish he wasn't adopted so I don't sort of allow myself that game because it's you know...\" And then she suddenly growls, \"But I waited for him. Eighteen, and I thought, 'Right, where are you?' It was quite hard that he didn't come forward then.\" And when I ask how much she thought about him all those years (she and Lyon never had children) she just sort of makes some noises: \"Um. Er-ha. Ohhh. When I saw people with little boys in their arms... Er, again strongly. Er.\" And then, pulling herself together again, she goes to get me a glass of water.</p> <p>When she comes back she says, \"There are probably a lot of people in politics who have a tough time but they hide it all because politicians pretend they're perfect.

      "bodyText": "Clare Short, the secretary of state for international development, used to have a Great Dane called Fred (\"so he didn't get any illusions of grandeur\"), but he died and wasn't replaced. She's trying to persuade her mother to have a dog now, a spaniel perhaps, that Short would walk when she goes home to Birmingham at weekends - but she won't \"because of what it would do in the garden\". Short looks mournful when she tells me this. \"Dogs are nice,\" she says, \"and they teach you how you should be with your friends. They always love you unconditionally. You shout at them and two minutes later they love you again and therefore you love them. And if human beings were like that to each other we'd all be a lot happier.\" Clare Short is, you might say, the Fred of the Labour party, always being shouted at, always bounding back. Everyone waits for \"the Clare Gaffe\", the blowing of the Short fuse; anticipates the rebuke, the tap on the nose; then smiles happily when there seem to be no hard feelings all round. Take her past advocation of higher tax \"for people like me\" or her attack on Blair's \"men in the dark\", or last week's comments on the Catholic church's opposition to contraception (\"stuck and wrong\", \"just another burden\" in the fight against Aids). Hardly had an hour gone by before the prime minister's office issued a statement distancing itself from Short's \"personal\" views: \"Blair chides Short\" read the headlines. But then it all seemed to end as quickly as it began. \"There is absolutely no difference between me and Tony Blair on HIV/Aids,\" Short tells me doggedly, \"and there was no rebuke.\" We meet in her office in Victoria where a secretary carries around an \"out of order\" sign to secure the lift in case Short needs it. It's a tatty building, as it should be when your brief is to help the poorest of the poor, but Short seems on top of the world here, striding down the long corridors in her swishy black trousers and heels, two steps ahead of her aides, queen of all she surveys. She is full of beans, says there is nothing she could be doing that was \"more important, more needy... more noble. Don't tell the others,\" she adds with a laugh, \"but this is definitely the best job in government.\" At the suggestion, though, that it was canny of the prime minister to have given it to her, to have funnelled her passions and convictions in that direction, she is suddenly quite crisp. \"What I resist,\" she says, \"is that I'm the sort of person only this would do for. I've had that all my life. It's partly to do with being a woman, it's partly to do with really believing what I believe in. People think that means you haven't got a good brain - a woman who feels passionately presumably doesn't do all the analysis.\" She is a big woman in the flesh, an elegant 54 with long legs and a broad chest. The cheekbones on her face with its Aztec features and ruddy complexion are so high they bump her eyes. She is much grander than you expect, majestic even. She is strident, wonderfully articulate, on the subjects of globalisation and international investment agreements, on the increase of literacy, the decrease of mortality. Only when she gives a throaty guffaw and kicks off her shoes do you realise she's wearing pop socks. Only when she relaxes, when she's talking about dogs and family, do you really notice the Birmingham accent. In a world uneasy with spin, Short is a still point, a haven in a storm. She might even, in the current climate, be the perfect politician. \"I'm not sure that all my colleagues would agree,\" she says at that. \"To be honest I never could talk the soundbites. I just can't bear it. It offends me intellectually.\" She thinks in retrospect that spin may have been justified in 1997 -\"If standing on our heads and waggling our toes in the air would have made us win we'd all have done it\" - but that they should have been more confident earlier. \"I think the country is in tune with our real values and we could have been more straight about what we're doing.\" Only the press, she believes, is \"is still obsessed with spin over substance\", driven - last week being a case in point - by \"the need to report drama and clashes\". She has often had a bad time in the papers, \"when you're ripped apart in front of all those people who don't know you,\" most notably during her campaign against page three girls. \"If I had known the price you pay in media terms and all that personal stuff I don't think I would have had the courage to [go into politics] at all,\" she says. She finds the House of Commons can be \"very silly\". People no longer snigger when cervical cancer is mentioned as they did when she first became MP for Birmingham Ladywood in 1983, but prime minister's question time is a trial. \"Once a month Tony comes on after me and I sit there and think, 'Good heavens!' Well, it's so... so schoolboyish. It is. It really is. And I think, 'God, I've got to keep a sensible face because people will think I'm frowning at what Tony's saying, and I'm not. I'm thinking, 'What a wallyish way of organising our country!'\" As for Blair's perceived phoniness: \"I said to Alastair [Campbell], 'It's time you put Tony out on the media now.' People have begun to think he's so awful that if they see the real him they'll like him. He's a very different kind of character to me - well, he's a man - but there is a large part of him that is completely genuine and absolutely straight. People just need to hear him being practical and informed and just knowing what he's doing.\" She believes in openness and she has always talked about the big things in her personal life. She gave extremely moving interviews about the death from Alzheimer's in 1993 of her husband, the former Labour minister Alex Lyon. And she was very careful three years later to manage, in media terms, the reunion with Toby, the son she gave up for adoption when she was 18, and who had contacted her when he was a 31-year-old solicitor with Tory leanings. Even now she has firmly prepared things to say about it. She says she has to be careful, for both their sakes. \"I've always been a kind of optimist and I've always liked people but since I've got Toby back it's like a completion of my fundamental happiness. I always had a bit of pain in me and that's healed, so I'm happier than I probably deserve to be. You know, profoundly in a way. And he's completely gorgeous - I love him to bits.\" But if you ask her more questions she does start to falter a little. When I wondered if she regretted that Toby had never met Alex, she says, \"I haven't, you see, because then I wish . . . or you know you go back and unwish all the bad things ... Obviously I wish he wasn't adopted so I don't sort of allow myself that game because it's you know...\" And then she suddenly growls, \"But I waited for him. Eighteen, and I thought, 'Right, where are you?' It was quite hard that he didn't come forward then.\" And when I ask how much she thought about him all those years (she and Lyon never had children) she just sort of makes some noises: \"Um. Er-ha. Ohhh. When I saw people with little boys in their arms... Er, again strongly. Er.\" And then, pulling herself together again, she goes to get me a glass of water. When she comes back she says, \"There are probably a lot of people in politics who have a tough time but they hide it all because politicians pretend they're perfect. And of course we know that life's more turbulent than that, and often people who have been through things understand deeply when someone else is hurting. The evidence seems to be that people like to know the truth and actually feel more trust in you if you have feet of clay like everybody else.\" One of her assistants pops his head round the corner then and reminds her that she has \"a meeting about the UN\" to go to. Short says, \"I go back to Birmingham on Thursdays. Everybody knows me there. I don't have to be ... da da da da. And you need that. You know, having a car waiting for you and people organising your life, it could give you illusions of grandeur. You need to be an ordinary person in your ordinary place.\" And then she puts her shoe back on. Even as she does so someone is probably already scurrying down the corridor with the \"out of order\" sign to block the lift.",

Prior to My Bed, she provoked mild outrage with Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995, a tent embroidered inside and out with the names of all her bed partners, which fetched \u00a340,000. Her challenging work was complemented by some memorable disappearances on television. In 1997 she stormed out of the Turner Prize dinner, and the following year she enlivened a live arts programme with a drunken, expletive-filled appearance. In an interview with Tatler magazine, which appears next month, she insisted that she had grown up somewhat in the past 18 months, and now worked with a discipline absent from her previous work. \"She can drink, swear like a squaddie and is clearly brilliant at attracting publicity,\" said David Lee, former editor of Art Review. \"It's visibility and controversy which gets the price up.\" In which case Emin, 37, would appear to be an old master.",

It is actually quite simple. Blair and Brown are different from Wilson and Callaghan in that they have taxed first and spent later. Previous Labour cabinets were spend-and-tax governments - they spent with abandon on arriving in office, then asked voters to pick up the tab as polling day approached. Hardly a winning formula. </p> <p>In terms of staying in power, the Blair-Brown approach makes more sense. Taxes were increased sharply in Labour's first two years, and spending was even lower than it would have been under the Conservatives. The result has been a burgeoning budget surplus. When the Conservatives say Mr Brown will have to impose new tax increases to pay for his spending plans, they are wrong. Labour can increase spending by 3.3% a year, while the economy is growing by 2.5% by drawing down all the money Brown has been stashing away in the treasury's piggy bank. </p> <p>To give credit where it is due, the government has handled the public finances in precisely the way it said it would while in opposition. But getting top marks for honesty does not mean that the approach has been cost free. Politically, it has suffered because the high expectations voters had for improvements to public services have not been met. Taking a tough line on spending was one thing; trying to pull the wool over our eyes with a bundle of inflated claims has merely fostered a cynicism that will result in the government receiving scant credit even when things start to get better. </p> <p>Moreover, the figures from the Department of Social Security last week show that Labour's first two years in office saw an increase in the number of people living below the poverty line. The explanation is simple. The government allowed incomes at the top to rise very rapidly, while keeping a tight lid on incomes at the bottom by indexing benefits to inflation. Alistair Darling's attempt to play down the figures by saying that the number of people living in absolute poverty has fallen is casuistry of the highest order. Absolute poverty has fallen steadily since the industrial revolution, which is why yesterday's luxuries are today's necessities. When it was in opposition, Labour used to excoriate the Conservatives when there was an increase in the number of people living in households below half the national average income. If this yardstick was right then, it is right now. </p> <p><strong> False economy</strong><br> </p> <p>The government's parsimony has also had economic costs, although these are less quantifiable. Capital investment in Britain's infrastructure is even lower under Labour than it was under the Conservatives, and this is particularly evident in transport, where spending is down by more than a third in real terms since the mid 90s. The private finance initiative has not papered over the cracks, although it has lined plenty of pockets. Ministers have told us constantly that the key to a successful modern economy is a well educated and highly skilled workforce, so why the delay giving David Blunkett the extra billions needed for schools? </p> <p>It is now too late to cry over spilt milk. The government chose to hold back spending in its first two years and to concentrate on eradicating the fiscal deficit inherited from the Conservatives because its main priority was not tackling pensioner poverty or modernising schools, but convincing the financial markets Labour could manage the economy competently. Throughout, the chancellor would intone gravely that his prudence was for a purpose, and now, at last, Labour can start to act as a Labour government should. </p> <p>Brown and his team argue that the sustained increases in health and education spending would not have been possible had Labour not first established its credentials, and they are right. The 1964-70 and 1974-79 governments were forced into deep cuts in public expenditure as the economic climate darkened. In retrospect, Brown's handling of public spending may look much smarter than, say, Robin Cook's much-vaunted ethical foreign policy, where the government's decision to sell arms to military dictatorships and cuddle up to big business has made the boasts of those first few heady days look utterly hollow. </p> <p>Amid the justifiable claims that Labour has been forced to the right by William Hague's populism, the economy is one area where the government has moved the Conservatives to the left. Michael Portillo claimed yesterday that he would spend more on health and education than Brown. Last week's watering down of Hague's absurd \"tax guarantee\" was another indication of how the rules of engagement are set by the chancellor, and the Conservatives will have their work cut out explaining how they could find the savings to pay for their tax cuts. </p> <p>Brown's next challenge is to rehabilitate the idea of public spending. On the face of it this should not be difficult, given that only those who live in gated mansions and travel everywhere by helicopter could fail to see that Britain has become the text-book example of JK Galbraith's wisdom about private affluence and public squalor. However, the denigration of the public realm has been so intense that Labour has to show that the billions coming out of the Treasury are being well spent. As such, Brown's billions will come with all sorts of New Labour strings attached - public service agreements, capital charging, quantifiable targets. The treasury insists that this process has been streamlined since the first comprehensive spending review two years ago, with fewer yet more-meaningful objectives, but there are dangers with this approach - departments are given the wrong targets (such as cutting class sizes or hospital waiting lists), quantity comes at the expense of quality and ministries are encouraged to cheat to meet their goals. </p> <p>For the next year, this will not trouble the government much, because, in the short-term, the CSR is crucial to Labour's re-election plans. Throughout the autumn and winter, spending ministers will dribble out announcements on how the money will be used to build a hospital in this marginal constituency or a school in that. Barring an unexpected disaster, it should be enough to win Blair his second term. </p> <p><strong> Civilisation has its price</strong><br> </p> <p>Looking ahead to Blair 2, things get more interesting. Governments normally like to go in for a bit of belt-tightening early in a parliament to make room for a splurge later on. The spending commitments in the CSR mean that this will not happen, and there is a danger - albeit unlikely at the moment when the economic background is so benign - that higher public spending will lead to over-heating. </p> <p>More important, perhaps, is that, according to the Treasury's forecasts, the public finances will be back in the red by the time the plans for the next spending review are laid, even though the borrowing will be only for capital projects. </p> <p>Will Labour be able to keep on spending at the present rate? Perhaps. It could be that the trend rate of growth has improved so that the growth of spending and the growth of the economy are aligned. Nobody, least of all the chancellor, one suspects, is banking on this. It could be that overall spending growth can be cut while spending on priorities is maintained because reduced debt interest payments and lower unemployment allow the government to shift resources from \"bads\" to \"goods\". Brown will announce an extra \u00a33bn for departments tomorrow precisely for this reason. But if neither of these things happen, Labour will be forced to decide whether it is prepared to raise taxes. If this is the choice, there should be no hesitation. Tax is the price we pay for a civilised society. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Mr Mugabe abolished the post of minister for war veterans' affairs, which had been expected to go to Mr Hunzvi. There were also contradictory messages about the simmering land issue, making it uncertain whether the war veterans will leave the 1,400 farms they now occupy illegally. The vice-president, Joseph Msika, said land seizures would start immediately. He said the war veterans would be moved off the 1,400 farms to 200 farms designated for seizure through lawful - although questionable - means. \"Our 'Fast Track' land resettlement starts today.

In a speech to 4,000 war veterans, Mr Hunzvi warned that anyone who opposed them would end up \"6ft underground\", and he pressed Mr Mugabe to speed up the land confiscations. \"I do not usually want to give our government ultimatums, but today I am doing so,\" he said. \"If the government does not speed up taking the remainder of the farms, we the war veterans are going to do that.

      "bodyText": "Britain's leading workaholic, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is being told by Treasury mandarins to cut down the long hours culture in his department. The Treasury has formed a task force to reduce working hours following evidence that the devotion to duty demanded of its conscientious civil servants is a barrier to recruitment. This comes as a survey reveals British managers worked longer hours than their American counterparts, and were second only to Germans. The Treasury has been trying to attract more civil servants from the private sector but officials admit they are finding it difficult. Mr Brown, the son of a Methodist preacher, is seen as the personification of the work ethic. He is known to ring political colleagues in the early hours to discuss proposals in a speech and enjoys working breakfasts. Research submitted to the Treasury select committee's inquiry into the efficiency of the department has found that, between January and March 1999, 3% of staff worked more than 20 hours over their fixed contracts; 6% worked an extra 16 hours, and 13% more than 11 hours, and 31% more than six hours. A Treasury memorandum suggests: \"We all need to ensure we manage our time effectively - for example, by discussing with those for whom we work what jobs we can eliminate entirely, because they add little value... and by remembering that calling meetings before 9.30am or after 5pm and continuing them after 6pm is unsociable and can cause particular problems for people with families.\" Research by an office supplies firm, Esselte, found German company bosses worked more than 70 hours a week compared with 60 hours by their British counterparts.

No matter how online you are, office space, equipment and all the other mundane needs of business have to be well managed. </p> <p>Believe us, we have seen the lot. There are internet incubators with dot.com executives crammed into tiny spaces, established companies with huge corporate boardrooms and cutting-edge marketing teams working in loft-like luxury. </p> <p>For dot.coms, \"meeting and greeting\" space in particular seems to be in scarce supply. As organisations recruit at pace, it seems meeting space gets pushed out in favour of work space. </p> <p>But you never know what to expect from start ups. We had one meeting last week in a relatively small, unattractive open-plan office in London that was being shared by at least six dot.com start-ups. So packed was the office that we had to negotiate to get a square foot of privacy. For those start-ups selling things online, the problem of storing goods is as important as providing space for workers. One online retailer we visited didn't bother dividing staff from products. They had solved the problem by having their people work around the products they sell. </p> <p>Every inch of space was taken.

      "bodyText": "Working in cyberspace presents many problems - but one of the biggest headaches is finding the right hole in the real world to work out of. No matter how online you are, office space, equipment and all the other mundane needs of business have to be well managed. Believe us, we have seen the lot. There are internet incubators with dot.com executives crammed into tiny spaces, established companies with huge corporate boardrooms and cutting-edge marketing teams working in loft-like luxury. For dot.coms, \"meeting and greeting\" space in particular seems to be in scarce supply. As organisations recruit at pace, it seems meeting space gets pushed out in favour of work space. But you never know what to expect from start ups. We had one meeting last week in a relatively small, unattractive open-plan office in London that was being shared by at least six dot.com start-ups. So packed was the office that we had to negotiate to get a square foot of privacy. For those start-ups selling things online, the problem of storing goods is as important as providing space for workers. One online retailer we visited didn't bother dividing staff from products. They had solved the problem by having their people work around the products they sell. Every inch of space was taken. Alongside and in between the usual PCs and office furniture were piles of boxes which blocked out the light. The business was a success and the office - where about 30 people were based - had obviously been outgrown a long time ago. In the same week, and in stark contrast, we visited one of the country's largest high street retailers. This was very much the traditional suit and tie operation with huge offices and a separate suite of meeting rooms. We were in with the top managers and looked on with envy. The first thing that struck us was that looking around the large and ornate meeting room with the four of us in it, we noticed how our entire workforce - 10 and rising - could have happily occupied it with room to spare. Interestingly some large organisations have by accident rather than design created a busy start-up atmosphere with an economic attitude towards space and equipment. This tends to be where the parent company has set up a separate internet business and given them clear resources and space to work with. The problem here appears to be how fast the new economy side of the business swallows up the old - and will the holders of purse strings let them have the office space to do so. \u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of Rools.com, a service that lets teenagers buy securely online without a credit card.",

      "bodyText": "The Clinton administration is preparing to ask Congress to approve at least $15bn in extra spending - possibly as much as $40bn - to implement the key terms in any Middle East peace deal reached in the talks at Camp David, it emerged yesterday. As negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians continued for the sixth day at the presidential retreat in Maryland, reports in Washington underlined the scale of the price which the government is willing to pay for a peace deal in a presidential election year, and to secure Bill Clinton's legacy. While military and political power are fundamental to its ability to bring the opposing sides together at Camp David, the reality is that it is US money which is the ultimate guarantee of any deal reached there. Any agreement is certain to be conditional upon the US providing the biggest package of new Middle East aid for almost a quarter of a century. Under the 1978 Camp David agreement, the US is still paying Egypt and Israel combined annual support amounting to $5bn (\u00a33.1bn). The 1998 Wye River agreement between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians came with a $1.88bn American aid tag. Among the items for which US dollars would be required are the relocation of Israeli military bases and borders, a fresh arms deal with Israel, and compensation to Palestinian refugees for the loss of their homes. Officials describe the emerging terms of such a package as \"still vague\", but the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, has begun to discuss the broad outlines with senators. Senator Mitch McConnell, a leading Republican, accused Mr Clinton yesterday of trying to \"buy an agreement because it's an election year\". Not surprisingly, there are signs that both the Israelis and the Palestinians have embarked on a bidding war for financial support from Washington as part of a deal on new borders in the region. The Israeli ambassador to Washington, David Ivry, spent much of last week mobilising congressional allies in support of a huge request for extra aid to implement a deal. In the past week alone Mr Ivry has held separate meetings with between 30 and 40 members of Congress on the issue, the Israeli embassy confirmed. Palestinian officials, meanwhile, have floated the figure of $40bn to cover compensation to Arabs who lost their land and homes at the time of Israel's establishment in 1948. Even if, as expected, this proves to be an unrealistic figure, there is no doubt that Washington will have to write several large cheques to ensure Palestinian agreement to any Camp David deal. The lion's share would almost certainly go to Israel to pay for the the security arrangements it would need in consequence of an agreement. Israel is expecting to spend billions of dollars relocating its armed forces to defend the redrawn borders which will be at the heart of any deal. Some Israeli officials have asked for more money to \"remake the Israeli military in the US image\", a Republican source said. While the White House accepts that Washington will be the principal financial guarantor of any deal the US managed to bring about, the administration has said that it expects America's allies to contribute too. The European Union, Japan and Saudi Arabia will all face demands for support, and President Clinton is likely to raise the issue at the G8 summit in Okinawa this week.",

I tried to suggest that beyond its brutal design, beyond the way it sliced through old London with the finesse of a blunt butcher's knife, the Westway was a fascinating road, a thing of strange if questionable beauty. </p> <p>Readers weren't having it. Aside from two informative letters from engineers involved in the project, the response was perhaps rightly vituperative, and, at the time, not a little shaming. My problem, like many other people I know, is that I like fast cars and public transport, civilised city centres and the thrill of driving on dramatic roads into big, sodium and neon-lit cities by night. </p> <p>Since then, this controversy seems to have melted into the lead-free air. Or at least it has if you go down to the Architecture Foundation, a gallery in deepest, traffic-laced London St James's. Their exhibition, It's a Gas On the Road, is an unashamed celebration of \"petrol pumps, flyovers and architecture for the car\". Originally a Hayward Gallery roadshow, On the Road has been extended by Helen Jones's It's a Gas, a homage to the petrol station. </p> <p>To most people the banal roadside pitstop is a necessary and useful nothingness, a blind spot in the day, something to do with packets of Handy-Andies, M&amp;Ms and bored staff in red jumpers: to design historian Jones they are as intriguing as out-of-the-way votive shrines are to the church-crawler with a pocket full of Pevsner. </p> <p>It's a small show on a giant subject, and it doesn't come much bigger than the Westway or the Humber Bridge, built by Freeman, Fox and Partners in 1981. What it says, to me at least, is that the shock of Spaghetti Junction (Sir Owen Williams and Partners, 1972) has long since vanished. An A-road of contemporary writers, photographers and historians sing the body concrete. One young critic suggests that, for an Italian baroque architect of the 17th century, the Westway would have curves \"to die for\". </p> <p>The point, though, is clear: in little more than a decade, the arterial road and its panoply of car parks and service stations, bridges and tunnels, has been elevated from the status of a pariah to the pantheon of architectural wonders. The Westway and Spaghetti Junction are up there, if you swallow the Architecture Foundation's line, with Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini's Piazza Navona. </p> <p>It makes sense, in an age when the car is no longer king, that we should look at roads and roadside architecture in a new light. To protest against insensitively planned new roads in our crowded islands makes obvious sense, yet we cannot ignore the fact that even motorway protesters beetle down to campsites in battered VW campers - along the roads that flourished in the wake of the Beeching report of 1963 that signed the death sentence for an integrated British railway network. </p> <p>For nearly 40 years, from the era of the Morris 1100 and Cortina Mk1, we have been a nation not so much in thrall with roads and their attendant architecture, as dependent on them. The Forth Road Bridge, one of the first engineering wonders of the road-dependent age, opened a year after Beeching. The railway age was now to be challenged by the structural might of the motorway epoch. </p> <p>Who can fail to be impressed by the nature-defying Humber Bridge, and who can fail to be fascinated, as well as frustrated, by the M6's Spaghetti Junction? At a time when Britain's sordidly privatised railways have been relegated to those of Cuba on a bad day, we can't help feeling we need our cars more than ever before; and, as we do, perhaps we can't help paying more attention to the roadside architecture that serves them. One of Jones's discoveries when compiling It's a Gas is James Trew, busy at work on a chain of sculptures based on petrol station canopies, but located in natural settings in France rather than on the roadside. Trew sees the petrol station canopy as the \"epitome of artificiality\". </p> <p>So critics, artists and historians are queuing up, like Friday afternoon traffic on the A40, to give praise to this relatively new, if curiously overlooked, architecture: all this before one gets to grips with Edward Platt's fascinating book Leadville: A Biography of the A40. </p> <p>We can see, too, how some of the best contemporary architects have been taking roadside architecture increasingly seriously. The Architecture Foundation exhibition shows a model of Foster and Partners 1998 design for a Repsol petrol station chain in Spain. A couple of months back Ivan Margolius published his handsome book Automobiles by Architects (Wiley-Academy, 2000). Inside is Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret's 1928-36 design for a \"voiture minimum\"; but, more importantly, there's Le Corbusier, one of the most influential architects of the 20th century, posing in front of his Voisin 10CV, which was used as a modernist prop in several famous photographs of his early white villas of the late 1920s. </p> <p>From then on, streamlined (and otherwise all but featureless) modern buildings were best seen through the windscreen of Le Corbusier's Voisin, Frank Lloyd Wright's Cord 810 drophead, the Adler Standard 6 designed by Mies van der Rohe in 1931. </p> <p>In the early 60s, Alison Smithson, the English architect who co-designed the Economist building where the Architecture Foundation has its gallery, wrote AS in DS, an intriguing, if largely forgotten, book about the relationship between architecture, landscape and the road as seen through the windcreen of her Citroen DS. The book was shaped on the floorplan of the sensational French car that, on its launch in 1955, Roland Barthes compared to a gothic cathedral. Here, said the philosopher, was \"the beginnings of a new phenomenology of assembling, as if one progressed from a world where elements are welded to a world where they are juxtaposed and held together by sole virtue of their wondrous shape\". And who but a confusion of modern French philosophers could argue with that? </p> <p>The fact, however, that so many diverse talents have turned their attention to the architecture of the road, from the heroic poetry of bridges to the doggerel of petrol stations, should encourage us to hope that a future generation of architects will see roads not as high-speed rats' alleys between their wonderful buildings, but as the glue that, for better or worse, sticks our towns and their architecture together. </p> <p>It's a Gas On the Road is at the Architecture Foundation, London SW1 (020 7839 9389) until September 3.

A Reuters cameraman, two Palestinian journalists, and four Palestinians were injured in fighting in Hebron, where 400 Jewish settlers live among thousands of Arabs. The Israeli army had no immediate comment on the violence. It said on Saturday that the trouble appeared to have broken out after a Palestinian youth tried to kiss a settler. Israeli troops withdrew from most of Hebron in 1997 under an agreement with the Palestinian Authority, but are deployed around Jewish enclaves. Meanwhile, the security forces evacuated 30 young Jewish settlers from a site near the village of Al Khader (above) after they had set up a renegade out post and watchtower to protest against possible Israeli concessions to the Palestinians at the Camp David summit. Soldiers and policemen tried to prise protesters off the roof of one of the shacks erected by the group. The settlers sang Israel's national anthem as they were taken away. Two settlers were arrested during the evacuation, the army said. It was predicted that tens of thousands would gather in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv last night to protest against the peace talks.",

The price of a bundle of phragmites autralis reeds, enough for a square foot of roof, has risen to \u00a31.85, making thatch very expensive to repair.</p> <p>English Nature, charged with creating habitats for rare birds that live in reeds, notably the near extinct bittern and threatened hen harrier, has seen a business opportunity. The organisation is planting thatching reeds on old peat workings on the Somerset levels. Robin Prowse, site manager of Meare Heath, near Glastonbury, said there was no local knowledge of how to grow reeds for thatching, and he had to call in experts from Norfolk reed beds to advise him.</p> <p>Jack Lewis, of Compton Durville in Somerset, a thatcher for 35 years, said: \"We have real difficulty getting the materials we need. Reed is not really traditional round here - we find straw even on ancient buildings, but we cannot get it. We import reed from places like Hungary, Poland, and Turkey.\"</p> <p>Some 40,000 bundles were needed annually for Somerset alone, and imported reed was packaged, straight, and free of weeds.</p> <p>\"English Nature will have to work hard to produce the quality we need. It's no use producing stuff with rubbish in it and reeds like a dog's hind leg,\" said Mr Lewis.</p> <p>Mr Prowse said 25 acres had been planted and could be harvested in two years time. \"Potentially it is an important industry for this area, which will provide a useful income we can plough back into more reed beds. It is a rare example of an industry that is of nothing but benefit for the wildlife.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "English Heritage is starting its own cottage industry, growing thatch for the nation's ancient roofs. There are 24,000 listed thatched roof buildings in Britain, but because suitable straw and reed is not available, material is imported. The price of a bundle of phragmites autralis reeds, enough for a square foot of roof, has risen to \u00a31.85, making thatch very expensive to repair. English Nature, charged with creating habitats for rare birds that live in reeds, notably the near extinct bittern and threatened hen harrier, has seen a business opportunity. The organisation is planting thatching reeds on old peat workings on the Somerset levels. Robin Prowse, site manager of Meare Heath, near Glastonbury, said there was no local knowledge of how to grow reeds for thatching, and he had to call in experts from Norfolk reed beds to advise him. Jack Lewis, of Compton Durville in Somerset, a thatcher for 35 years, said: \"We have real difficulty getting the materials we need. Reed is not really traditional round here - we find straw even on ancient buildings, but we cannot get it. We import reed from places like Hungary, Poland, and Turkey.\" Some 40,000 bundles were needed annually for Somerset alone, and imported reed was packaged, straight, and free of weeds. \"English Nature will have to work hard to produce the quality we need. It's no use producing stuff with rubbish in it and reeds like a dog's hind leg,\" said Mr Lewis. Mr Prowse said 25 acres had been planted and could be harvested in two years time. \"Potentially it is an important industry for this area, which will provide a useful income we can plough back into more reed beds. It is a rare example of an industry that is of nothing but benefit for the wildlife.\"",

      "body": "<p>As the publisher of Norman Finkelstein's The Holocaust Industry, I am dismayed at Jonathan Freedland's article (An enemy of the people, July 14). He seems not to disagree with any of the significant arguments in the book, but insists they have all been made previously. He is quite wrong: Finkelstein's explanation for the comparatively recent adoption of the Holocaust as a major issue by American Jewish leaders has never been made before and his research on the misappropriation of Holocaust compensation is both new and shocking.</p> <p>Freedland's primary criticism is that the tone of the book implies a hostile attitude towards the Jews and that Finkelstein, a Jew whose parents were survivors of the Nazi camps, is self-hating. Freedland repeatedly suggests similarities between Finkelstein's outlook and that of Holocaust denier David Irving.</p> <p>These claims are crudely insulting of a writer who has displayed great courage in raising difficult questions about the policies of Jewish leaders and their detrimental effect on the wider Jewish community. Hannah Arendt, in the storm prompted by the publication of her book Eichmann In Jerusalem, was defended by Gershom Scholem as someone who loved the Jews. Arendt declined this defence pointing out that whilst she loved her friends and family she could not possibly love an entire people. Freedland's requirement that Finkelstein waves a flag of affection for all Jews draws on the same reasoning as anti-Semites who preach hatred against them.</p> <p><b>Colin Robinson </b><br>Verso</p> <p>\u0095 Even the most uninformed reader should be able to recognise the tell-tale signs of demagoguery in Finkelstein's wild rhetoric, quotations out of context, and the mixture of trivial and significant detail jumbled together.</p> <p>But why should the Guardian showcase this bit of American vulgar sensationalism just when your own Imperial War Museum has opened an impressive Holocaust wing and days before the opening of the conference Remembering for the Future? The ill-considered outburst you chose to print only reinforces my sense as an American of a certain British obtuseness when it comes to Jewish matters.</p> <p><b>Prof Froma I Zeitlin </b><br>Director of Jewish Studies,<br>Princeton University<br> fiz@princeton.edu</p> <p>\u0095 If the Holocaust is not being treated as a sacred mystery and a unique historical event, why would states such as the US and UK, which took no part in perpetrating this crime create memorials, museums and commemorative occasions for it while neglecting atrocities in their own histories, such as the genocide of the native Americans and aboriginal Australians and the enslavement of Africans, not to mention the insistence of the US in the 80s on continuing to recognise Pol Pot's government long after it became known that it had slaughtered 2m Cambodians?</p> <p><b>Dr Riadh Abed </b><br>Sheffield <br>abed@globalnet.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 There is no such thing as a \"Holocaust industry\". There are only good men and women working hard to educate the public about the Holocaust, so that its horrors shall never be experienced again. These same people are also struggling to provide some measure of justice both to ageing Holocaust survivors and non-Jewish victims against whom the Nazis committed the greatest robbery in the history of mankind. Just one example: Estelle Sapir promised her father before he perished at a concentration camp that she would recover money he deposited at a Swiss bank. Ms Sapir struggled for over 50 years to keep her promise and, in May 1999, finally received the return of her father's funds. Finkelstein aims to shock rather than provide accurate information about the struggle to have corporate wrongdoers disgorge the billions in profits they earned from the suffering of others.</p> <p><b>Prof Michael Bazyler </b><br>Whittier Law School, USA</p> <p>\u0095 As a Dutch gentile, I helped Jews escape occupied Holland until I had to as well. My mother suffered months in prison as a hostage for the Nazis' failure to capture me.</p> <p>Three points in support of Finkelstein. Many gentiles suffered as much as Jews, as resisters and as slave labourers. Second, most survivors were compensated shortly after war's end, though no doubt inadequately. The third is the most important. Survivors built new lives for themselves, pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps. It is an insult to those who did so, like my Jewish foster brother, to moan about compensation 60 years later. They confuse money with justice and morality.</p> <p><b>Herman Friedhoff </b><br>Westcote Barton, Oxon</p> <p>\u0095 The Holocaust Industry contains a number of inaccuracies on the work of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. The Claims Conference has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to institutions that provide essential social services to survivors of the Shoah. In 1999 alone, in just the former Soviet Union, the Claims Conference funded a programme through which more than 805,000 food packages were delivered and more than 3m hot meals were served. Grants provided nearly 71,000 Nazi victims with fuel to maintain adequate heat through the winter, or with extra blankets, and provided more than 100,000 medical consultations</p> <p><b>Ben Helfgott</b><br>45 Aid Society</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the publisher of Norman Finkelstein's The Holocaust Industry, I am dismayed at Jonathan Freedland's article (An enemy of the people, July 14). He seems not to disagree with any of the significant arguments in the book, but insists they have all been made previously. He is quite wrong: Finkelstein's explanation for the comparatively recent adoption of the Holocaust as a major issue by American Jewish leaders has never been made before and his research on the misappropriation of Holocaust compensation is both new and shocking. Freedland's primary criticism is that the tone of the book implies a hostile attitude towards the Jews and that Finkelstein, a Jew whose parents were survivors of the Nazi camps, is self-hating. Freedland repeatedly suggests similarities between Finkelstein's outlook and that of Holocaust denier David Irving. These claims are crudely insulting of a writer who has displayed great courage in raising difficult questions about the policies of Jewish leaders and their detrimental effect on the wider Jewish community. Hannah Arendt, in the storm prompted by the publication of her book Eichmann In Jerusalem, was defended by Gershom Scholem as someone who loved the Jews. Arendt declined this defence pointing out that whilst she loved her friends and family she could not possibly love an entire people. Freedland's requirement that Finkelstein waves a flag of affection for all Jews draws on the same reasoning as anti-Semites who preach hatred against them. Colin Robinson Verso \u0095 Even the most uninformed reader should be able to recognise the tell-tale signs of demagoguery in Finkelstein's wild rhetoric, quotations out of context, and the mixture of trivial and significant detail jumbled together. But why should the Guardian showcase this bit of American vulgar sensationalism just when your own Imperial War Museum has opened an impressive Holocaust wing and days before the opening of the conference Remembering for the Future? The ill-considered outburst you chose to print only reinforces my sense as an American of a certain British obtuseness when it comes to Jewish matters. Prof Froma I Zeitlin Director of Jewish Studies, Princeton University fiz@princeton.edu \u0095 If the Holocaust is not being treated as a sacred mystery and a unique historical event, why would states such as the US and UK, which took no part in perpetrating this crime create memorials, museums and commemorative occasions for it while neglecting atrocities in their own histories, such as the genocide of the native Americans and aboriginal Australians and the enslavement of Africans, not to mention the insistence of the US in the 80s on continuing to recognise Pol Pot's government long after it became known that it had slaughtered 2m Cambodians? Dr Riadh Abed Sheffield abed@globalnet.co.uk \u0095 There is no such thing as a \"Holocaust industry\". There are only good men and women working hard to educate the public about the Holocaust, so that its horrors shall never be experienced again. These same people are also struggling to provide some measure of justice both to ageing Holocaust survivors and non-Jewish victims against whom the Nazis committed the greatest robbery in the history of mankind. Just one example: Estelle Sapir promised her father before he perished at a concentration camp that she would recover money he deposited at a Swiss bank. Ms Sapir struggled for over 50 years to keep her promise and, in May 1999, finally received the return of her father's funds. Finkelstein aims to shock rather than provide accurate information about the struggle to have corporate wrongdoers disgorge the billions in profits they earned from the suffering of others. Prof Michael Bazyler Whittier Law School, USA \u0095 As a Dutch gentile, I helped Jews escape occupied Holland until I had to as well. My mother suffered months in prison as a hostage for the Nazis' failure to capture me. Three points in support of Finkelstein. Many gentiles suffered as much as Jews, as resisters and as slave labourers. Second, most survivors were compensated shortly after war's end, though no doubt inadequately. The third is the most important. Survivors built new lives for themselves, pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps. It is an insult to those who did so, like my Jewish foster brother, to moan about compensation 60 years later. They confuse money with justice and morality. Herman Friedhoff Westcote Barton, Oxon \u0095 The Holocaust Industry contains a number of inaccuracies on the work of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. The Claims Conference has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to institutions that provide essential social services to survivors of the Shoah. In 1999 alone, in just the former Soviet Union, the Claims Conference funded a programme through which more than 805,000 food packages were delivered and more than 3m hot meals were served. Grants provided nearly 71,000 Nazi victims with fuel to maintain adequate heat through the winter, or with extra blankets, and provided more than 100,000 medical consultations Ben Helfgott 45 Aid Society",

The judges decided the piece posed no threat to the finality of jury verdicts or danger of pressure on future jurors.

Advocates of the move claim the evidence is too complex for juries to understand. Opponents argue that while the details of abstruse financial transactions may go over juries' heads, they are strong on common sense and have little trouble sussing out the key issue: did the defendant act with dishonest intent?</p> <p>But now at last a window has been opened into the jury room. For the first time researchers have been able to systematically investigate how real jurors go about their job. It hasn't happened in Britain and the findings have so far gone unnoticed here. But a large-scale research project has been carried out in a criminal justice system so similar to our own that its conclusions shine an unprecedented light into the workings of our own jury system.</p> <p>In New Zealand there is a convention that jurors may not be questioned about their experiences but not a blanket ban. Judicial approval was granted for the research to be carried out by a team from the Victoria University of Wellington, one of whom, Warren Young, is now deputy secretary for justice in the New Zealand ministry of justice. It was done in collaboration with the New Zealand law commission, the country's official law reform body, which is headed, like our own law commission, by a senior judge.</p> <p>Jury trials in New Zealand and England follow almost identical procedures. The main difference for the purpose of the jury study is that the 11-1 or 10-2 majority verdicts - introduced in England and Wales to counter jury-nobbling - are not possible in New Zealand. Unless all 12 jurors agree, the result is a hung trial and, usually, a retrial, which means New Zealand jurors are under greater pressure to reach a unanimous verdict.</p> <p>The research team followed 48 criminal trials and interviewed a total of 312 jurors, an average of 6.5 of the 12 jurors from each trial. The sample included a substantial number of high-profile cases because the researchers wanted to find out whether pre-trial publicity affected jurors' ability to reach their verdicts purely on the evidence in court. Also featured were complex fraud trials, cases with several defendants and multiple charges, drug, sex abuse and rape trials.</p> <p>The findings explode some long-held myths. They show that while jurors are \"overwhelmingly conscientious\" in following the judge's instructions, they do have difficulty with the concept of \"intent\" and whether or not a defendant acted dishonestly.</p> <p>The research also shows that \"some jurors have particular difficulty assessing the credibility of witnesses, challenging the traditional view that juries are particularly adept at assessing credibility\".</p> <p>And juries have problems in fully grasping the law. In four out of the 48 trials, legal errors led to hung juries or questionable verdicts, concluded the researchers.</p> <p>It was \"a great deal to ask\" of ordinary lawmen to take on board difficult concepts - such as the burden and standard of proof, the elements necessary to prove an offence, and rules of evidence - when they had heard them only once from the judge and were given no written record.</p> <p>In 19 trials, one or more jurors misunderstood significant aspects of the ingredients of the offence. \"Fairly fundamental\" misunderstandings of the law emerged during deliberations in 35 of the 48 cases. Jurors were unsure about the difference between purpose and intent, and sometimes thought intent implied premeditation.</p> <p>A significant number of jurors had difficulty concentrating on oral evidence, particularly in trials lasting more than two days, and problems in recalling the evidence.</p> <p>Trial judges, who were also interviewed, would have reached a different verdict from the jury's in 24 of the 48 cases. But in 11 cases where judge and jury disagreed the jury's view \"appeared reasonable and supportable on the evidence\". In most cases, the disagreement was over the credibility of key witnesses. Of the remainder, the jury was hung in five cases.</p> <p>There were five \"compromise\" verdicts where juries agreed to resolve their differences by convicting on some counts and acquitting on others, while the judge and researchers felt conviction was warranted on all counts. The remaining three were \"perverse or questionable\" verdicts, where the jury reached a unanimous decision on an erroneous basis.</p> <p>In 22 cases, pressure to reach a verdict came from other members of the jury. Those on their own or in a small minority felt the worst pressure, with the pressure increasing as the other minority jurors changed their minds. In six cases jurors said feeling that time was running out or that people wanted to get home was an important factor in reaching a verdict.</p> <p>Judges give standard directions to the jury when summing up, but at least some jurors did not realise these were standard. When the judge told them they could draw certain \"inferences\", some jurors, not knowing this was a standard direction, thought the judge was giving them hints on what the verdict should be. Others had no idea what the judge was talking about.</p> <p>Jurors experienced considerable stress from serving on the jury. Some found the experience \"harrowing\", causing them to feel \"sick to their stomachs\". Some had trouble sleeping or were prone to burst into tears. Some felt they had no business sitting in judgment on their fellow citizens.</p> <p>For others, the trial brought back experiences in their own lives. In one sex abuse case, four jurors disclosed their own experiences of sexual abuse, one for the first time, in the course of a \"lengthy and fraught\" deliberation which ended in a hung jury.</p> <p>Feeling intimidated, like the juror in the trial of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer found guilty of murdering a burglar, is not, it seems, unusual. A number of jurors felt intimidated by being stared at by counsel, the accused and his family, and in four cases jurors felt \"intimidated and scared\" after the trial finished.</p> <p>The findings on pre-trial publicity will reassure judges facing applications that a trial or retrial should not go ahead because of prejudicial media coverage. Even though high-profile cases were chosen for the study, jurors reported only a hazy recollection of the original incident. The researchers conclude that the impact of pre-trial publicity and coverage during the trial was \"minimal\".</p> <p>Isn't Britain, the cradle of the jury system, now grown-up enough to carry out its own research? In New Zealand, confirmation of juries' flaws has not led to the collapse of the system or calls for its abolition. In an editorial headlined \"Imperfect and all, juries still best\", the New Zealand Herald points out that the main result is likely to be more help for juries in carrying out their difficult task.</p> <p>So far, the study has produced only preliminary recommendations. These include more guidance for jury foremen, providing the jury with a written summary of the judge's summing up on the law, more help with flow charts and other aids in multi-defendant cases, and more encouragement to ask the judge questions - all of which would no doubt help our own juries to reach better verdicts.</p> <p>Warren Young, Neil Cameron and Yvette Tinsley, Juries in Criminal Trials (Law Commission preliminary paper no 37) can be found on the New Zealand Law Commission website at <a href=\"http://www.lawcom.govt.nz\" target=\"_NEW\">www.lawcom.govt.nz</a></p>",

Judges give standard directions to the jury when summing up, but at least some jurors did not realise these were standard. When the judge told them they could draw certain \"inferences\", some jurors, not knowing this was a standard direction, thought the judge was giving them hints on what the verdict should be. Others had no idea what the judge was talking about. Jurors experienced considerable stress from serving on the jury. Some found the experience \"harrowing\", causing them to feel \"sick to their stomachs\". Some had trouble sleeping or were prone to burst into tears. Some felt they had no business sitting in judgment on their fellow citizens. For others, the trial brought back experiences in their own lives. In one sex abuse case, four jurors disclosed their own experiences of sexual abuse, one for the first time, in the course of a \"lengthy and fraught\" deliberation which ended in a hung jury. Feeling intimidated, like the juror in the trial of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer found guilty of murdering a burglar, is not, it seems, unusual. A number of jurors felt intimidated by being stared at by counsel, the accused and his family, and in four cases jurors felt \"intimidated and scared\" after the trial finished. The findings on pre-trial publicity will reassure judges facing applications that a trial or retrial should not go ahead because of prejudicial media coverage. Even though high-profile cases were chosen for the study, jurors reported only a hazy recollection of the original incident. The researchers conclude that the impact of pre-trial publicity and coverage during the trial was \"minimal\". Isn't Britain, the cradle of the jury system, now grown-up enough to carry out its own research? In New Zealand, confirmation of juries' flaws has not led to the collapse of the system or calls for its abolition. In an editorial headlined \"Imperfect and all, juries still best\", the New Zealand Herald points out that the main result is likely to be more help for juries in carrying out their difficult task. So far, the study has produced only preliminary recommendations. These include more guidance for jury foremen, providing the jury with a written summary of the judge's summing up on the law, more help with flow charts and other aids in multi-defendant cases, and more encouragement to ask the judge questions - all of which would no doubt help our own juries to reach better verdicts.

It was Romeo and Juliet meets Desert Storm. It was Runaway Bride meets Lawrence of Arabia. It even has a cliff-hanger ending which is due to unravel today. </p> <p>He was a clean-cut 25-year-old US marine lieutenant corporal called Jason Johnson serving with the US Navy Fifth Fleet. She was a 19-year-old Bahraini princess called Merian Al-Khalifa who had taught herself English. When their eyes met in a shopping mall in Manama, the capital of the Gulf state Bahrain, last year it was love in a hot climate. Her family discovered the courtship and she was confined to her home, but continued the romance by telephone. Then, finally, the couple decided to flee and make their lives together in the US. It may sound like a treatment for a movie but this one is - more or less - true. </p> <p>Johnson had used his marine issue, night-vision goggles to suss out security at the airport and discovered that while Bahraini citizens had to show a passport when boarding a plane to leave the country, US marines did not. He forged papers for Al-Khalifa so that she would appear to be a member of the marine corps. Then as the time for departure approached, he got his beloved kitted out in sloppy, baggy American clothes. She hid her long hair under a New York Yankees baseball cap and, last November, they boarded a commercial flight from Bahrain to O'Hare airport in Chicago. </p> <p>There the hoax was discovered by immigration officials who wanted to deport her immediately as an illegal immigrant. She asked for asylum, claiming that if she returned to Bahrain her life would be in danger. She was eventually paroled into the US, granted a hearing and allowed to remain in the country while a decision was made. After being released by the immigration service, the INS, the princess married the marine in Johnson's home town of Las Vegas. Johnson, the son of a cement truck driver, was duly demoted to the rank of private for bringing an illegal immigrant into the country but is still serving at his unit in Camp Pendleton in southern California, where the couple now live on base. </p> <p>Today they are due to attend a private hearing with the INS in San Diego, where a decision will be made as to whether or not Al-Khalifa is allowed to stay. Even though she is now married to a US citizen, she still entered the country illegally, the INS will argue. Technically, this means that she could be deported and could then apply to enter either from her home country or another country of her choice. </p> <p>From the time of their arrival last November until last month, the world was unaware of the couple's story. But when a date was set for the immigration hearing, Johnson decided they needed the media on their side. As decision day approached, so interest increased, although Al-Khalifa has been reluctant to talk to the British press because she believes her family is more likely to see British newspapers and does not want to offend them. </p> <p>\"I did the worst thing possible in my country,\" she said in one interview. \"I fell in love with a non-Muslim. I've ruined the reputation of my family.\" She said the fact that Johnson was an American only made matters worse. As the daughter of Sheik Abdullah Al-Khalifa, who is the cousin of the head of state, Emir Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, she is part of the ruling elite. For her to marry a non-Muslim and elope to, of all places, Las Vegas, is obviously something of an embarrassment. But is it more than that? </p> <p>\"They'll kill her if she ever returns,\" Johnson has been quoted as saying. Although there is no suggestion that her family would lift a finger against her, he believes that fundamentalist clerics could threaten her life. Johnson's own family has made sympathetic and supportive noises about the couple while saying they understand how their daughter-in-law's family might well have been upset by her sudden departure. </p> <p>While the elopement has become big news in the US, it has had minimal coverage in the Middle East. \"The Arab press are treating it as something which should be hushed up, or mentioned only as a matter of shame and indignation,\" says the veteran Arab journalist Abdullah Homouda. \"She is considered a disgrace to the family and a political embarrassment.\" </p> <p>The Palestinian newspaper, al-Quds, published the story on its back page, with a picture. One of the paper's journalists, who asked not to be named, says: \"We didn't see it as a sensational story in the usual way of the American media. We approached it with a different perspective to show that although the Gulf royals are conservative they are not immune to change. The new generation of royals have studied abroad and have been exposed to western views and values. </p> <p>\"We did a similar story a year ago when a princess from the same family discovered she was a lesbian and found friends on the internet. She sought asylum in Britain and changed her identity. We tried to show the impact of the internet on Gulf society.\" </p> <p>As the couple fight for the princess's right to stay, the story has also entered the political arena in the US: one of California's two senators, Barbara Boxer, has indicated that she will back the couple's wishes and is due to appear at a press conference today at the time of the INS hearing. She has written a letter supporting the couple and parallels are being drawn with the Cuban Elian Gonzalez case - although so far no public figure has suggested that Al-Khalifa should be sent back to her family. This is a story where everyone wants to be on the happy-ever-after side. Al-Khalifa speaks good English and has been described in the American press as \"sounding like Posh Spice\". </p> <p>The story also has implications for the US military, which is particularly sensitive to public opinion because of its recruitment problems. Johnson offended many of his fellow \"grunts\" and \"leathernecks\" by saying that his love for his wife comes before his love for the marines. He has been harassed on the camp, where the couple live modestly. She is supposedly discovering the joys of housework. His superiors have publicly allied to support him - the marines do not want to be seen as the bad guys. </p> <p>As attention focuses on today's hearing, a skilful operation to ensure that the tale receives maximum coverage and makes it to the movie screens has been taking place. A key player in this is Tom Colbert, the president of Industry Research and Development, a company that promotes stories produced in local newspapers by placing them on television and in national newspapers and magazines. He has 45 clients and has handled 6,000 stories since starting up nine years ago. Twenty-one of them have become films, but this one is different. </p> <p>\"I knew it was a gem,\" said Colbert, who is based in Calabasas in the San Fernando Valley. \"It was the Persian Gulf Elian [Gonzalez] story, the biggest story we've ever had.\" The news item had come out in \"dead time\" on a Friday evening and no one had followed it up. Colbert decided to track down the couple and found them after calls to 22 Johnsons in the southern California telephone directory. He explained that he could help them. \"I said they were about to be in the middle of a firestorm.\" </p> <p>He said he had to make sure they could both handle the pressure before he pressed the button, and decided that the princess was well equipped - \"she's a sweet gal and she's very smart\" - so he went ahead. \"They are very much in love,\" he added. </p> <p>Colbert then contacted a Beverly Hills associate, Mary Aloe of Proud Mary Entertainment - an independent production company - and told her the story. She wasted no time in meeting the couple and signing up the film rights. Colbert then started planting stories in the press \"to fuel the interest\" in the film and see if any backers would come out. Already potential directors, writers and producers have emerged. A firm offer for the rights has just been made by Howard Braunstein, who is currently remaking South Pacific with Glenn Close in Australia. </p> <p>\"I fell in love with them,\" said Aloe. \"They are an awesome couple. Their story has everything. It's a thriller and there could be three different endings. They could live happily ever after and find out that her family secretly supported her. Or she could be sent back and he has to let her go. Or she's an independent young woman who realises she loves Jason but now that she's in America she wants to move on.\" Colbert adds: \"no matter what the ending, it's still a movie.\" </p> <p>So is it being cast already? Aloe thought Brad Pitt was \"a bit too laid back... Jason is a real John Wayne character, a young Steve McQueen all-American renegade, completely without fear.\" Freddy Prinze Jr has already been suggested and Aloe says they want at least one big star, probably male. For the princess, Selma Hayek has already been mentioned and Aloe reckons that Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie would be ideal. </p> <p>There will be other attractions for Hollywood than the story itself. It has a potential villain in the shape of cold-hearted Arab clerics wanting the love-struck young woman to return to face punishment. So far the Bahrainis are not playing their part quite right. A statement issued by the Bahrain Embassy in Washington indicated that her family would love her to come home and there would be no punishments or reprisals. Arabs, along with Britons, Germans and Russians, remain popular stock villains in Hollywood so this part of the tale may have to be altered. Arab-Americans have fought a long battle to try to educate their fellow countrymen away from the stereotypical views they hold of Arabs and the Muslim world. </p> <p>The appetite for \"real life\" film and television reconstruction remains undimmed. Recent subjects have included Elian Gonzalez (the first television drama appears at the end of this month)and Linda McCartney, while a bundle of recent films - from Erin Brockovich and The Insider to The Hurricane and Boys Don't Cry - have alerted studios to the strength of the genre. As one screenwriter responsible for an Oscar-winning film says: \"It's now easier to write a piece for Rolling Stone and then show that to a studio executive than to take in the original idea and pitch it.\" </p> <p>Usually a script doctor is brought in if the studio is uncertain about the right ending. Today that task falls to US officials, who will meet in private session in San Diego to decide whether it will be a happy or sad one for the young lovers.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The popular image of Anna Wintour is of a cold and terrifying woman. She is often referred to as an \"ice queen\" - or, more imaginatively, as \"nuclear Wintour\". At the offices of Vogue in New York, where she has reigned now for 12 years, the junior members of staff tremble in her presence and lose the gift of speech. What is it about Anna Wintour that frightens them so much? According to her friends (and she has many), her character, which is fundamentally amiable, is not to blame. She doesn't do horrible things to people. She isn't even rude to them. As a human being, she is probably less scary than Janet Street-Porter.</p> <p>But she is very powerful, and that is frightening in itself. Tonight's television documentary about her, in BBC1's Boss Women series, opens with the line: \"Anna Wintour is recognised as the most powerful woman in fashion.\" And this may be true. But her real power resides in her position as the editor of the most profitable magazine in all of the vast Cond\u00e9 Nast publishing empire, which includes Vanity Fair and The New Yorker in America and several publications over here, including Tatler and British Vogue.</p> <p>Under Wintour, Vogue sells 1.2m copies a month and earns around \u00a3100m a year in advertising revenue. It makes by far the largest contribution to Cond\u00e9 Nast's profits, and its multibillionaire chairman, SI Newhouse, is appropriately grateful. It is often alleged that \"Si\", as he is always called, is slightly in love with Wintour. He was also possibly slightly in love with Tina Brown when she edited Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, although she brought him prestige rather than profits in those jobs. But since Tina abandoned him to start a new magazine, Talk, for the Disney Corporation, Wintour has had no rival for his affection.</p> <p>Despite the apparent informality of US magazine offices, and the casual use of the first name in all conversations, employees are generally more respectful of hierarchy than they are in Britain. And Wintour, with the assured backing of the all-powerful Newhouse, is worthy of the utmost respect.</p> <p>On top of that, she has become a huge New York celebrity. The cult of the writer has been replaced by the cult of the editor. People ask for Wintour's autograph in restaurants. Newhouse encourages his editors to behave more like Hollywood studio bosses than the unglamorous drudges they used to be.</p> <p>Another explanation for Wintour's reputation for coldness could perhaps simply be that she is shy. Her father Charles Wintour, a celebrated editor of the Evening Standard who died last year, was sometimes known, according to Wintour herself, as \"Chilly Charlie\", and possibly for the same reason. When she was young, before she started wearing dark glasses all the time, she covered as much of her face as possible with a fringe.</p> <p>A colleague of hers insists that Wintour is not a self-publicist, and that even her dark glasses are not an affectation but are prescribed by an optician to protect her from eye strain. (An editor of Vogue has to spend a lot of time looking at light shows.)</p> <p>It is noteworthy that in tonight's television documentary she is without her dark glasses for most of the time. This new readiness to cast off their protection and reveal her face to the world has been attributed by some people to her new relationship with Shelby Bryan, a Texas cell-phone millionaire, for whom she has left her husband of many years, the child psychiatrist David Shaffer. They say that the ice queen has finally found romance.</p> <p>But whether she has found romance or not, she certainly hasn't allowed it to affect her hard-headed approach to her job. Although on Boss Women she says that Vogue aims to give people \"something to dream about\", this would not appear to be its principal mission. Other fashion magazines, like Harper's Bazaar in New York or even British Vogue in London, do this better.</p> <p>Wintour's magazine, more successful than either of them, is thoroughly down to earth and practical. Its business is to sell as many copies as possible and to maximise its advertising revenue. This is not achieved by being too imaginative or original. In a lecture in London to the organisation Women in Journalism two years ago, Wintour explained how nearly 25 years of working in New York had weaned her from British creative self-indulgence.</p> <p>She said she had come to accept that readers preferred \"healthy, smiling, energetic girls\" to \"sad, sick or strange ones\". She had also come to recognise the necessity of pleasing advertisers. \"If you don't acknowledge your magazine's advertisers, you don't have a magazine,\" she said.</p> <p>In an interview last year with New York Magazine, where she got her first job as a fashion editor in the early 1980s, Wintour again made her position clear. \"Commercial is not a dirty word to me,\" she said, adding that in a toss-up between promoting one fashion product or another, she would not hesitate to choose the one of a Vogue advertiser.</p> <p>Vogue has been through some difficult patches under Wintour, one of the worst being the recent defection of Kate Betts, her trusted chief lieutenant and heir apparent, to become editor of Harper's Bazaar. But Vogue still towers above its traditional rival.</p> <p>At Vogue, Kate Betts urged Wintour to make the magazine \"hipper\", to make it \"go into the street, cover hip-hop, pop culture and the internet\", says New York Magazine. But Wintour resisted, and it looks like she was right. Betts's efforts to steer Harper's towards hipness have yet to be crowned with commercial success. Meanwhile, Wintour has been consistently magnanimous in her public comments on her friend's desertion.</p> <p>So Vogue sails majestically on, the undisputed flagship of the \u00a3100bn American fashion industry, with Wintour's position still seemingly secure as she continues to bask in the favour of the often fickle Newhouse. \"I can't think of anything that could give me so much pleasure [as editing Vogue],\" she says at the end of tonight's documentary.</p> <p>Although she and Tina Brown are frequently bracketed together as the two British queens of US journalism, they could not in fact be more different. Now into her fourth editorship since she shook up the Tatler in London 20 years ago, Brown, unlike Wintour, started out as a writer and still apparently hankers after the role.</p> <p>At a party she gave in New York last month for the launch of Martin Amis's memoir, Experience, Brown told a reporter from the New York Observer: \"In my next incarnation, whatever that may be, in my fifth act, I'm going to be a really irresponsible writing journalist. I will write what the hell I want to write. And let 'em publish it as far as I'm concerned, because I've spent the last 10 or 15 years deciding whether something is right to run or not, and I would think it's my time to break out of the box.\"</p> <p>Wintour, on the other hand, seems happy in her box.

      "body": "<p>Sarah Ferguson may not have been invited to the Queen Mother's 100th birthday bash at St Paul's last week but she was there all right, in the form of two miniature replicas of her Ferginess. Newspaper pictures of her daughters show Beatrice (11) with long reddish hair, hand up in ya-ish salutation, smiling broadly, while Eugenie (eight) yawns. Both were apparently irrepressible, curtseying more than was strictly necessary.</p> <p>Now where did they get that from? If ever one person's genes wiped the floor with another's, it was when Sarah's eggs met Andrew's sperm. These girls haven't waited until their 30s to become their mother, they've got there before puberty.</p> <p>It was Oscar Wilde who said: \"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.\" Men have translated this into the ultimate insult: \"You're getting just like your mother.\" While they often claim they are chuffed to be getting like their fathers (\"He was quite a good bloke,\" they'll say, even if they hardly knew him), for women the issue is more complex. We may love our mothers but we don't want to become them. Maybe we just don't want to be older women, dyeing away the grey as we saw our mothers do before us. Maybe we think \"getting like your mother\" is a euphemism for getting fatter, more wrinkled, less desirable.</p> <p>To be accused (for that's what it is) of being like our mothers makes us think of all the annoying things our mothers do or did, their irritating gestures, and wonder whether we're doing them now. Biologically, we are likely to reach menopause at the same age our mother did. Are we similarly programmed to assume her mannerisms? Will the combined forces of nature and nurture make us unable to find our glasses, fall asleep after one glass of wine, lose our way in shopping malls?</p> <p>Tell a woman she looks like her mother and she is unlikely to take it as a compliment. Tell her she is behaving like her and she may be inconsolable. \"Do you think you're getting like your mother?\" I ask a friend in her 30s.

      "bodyText": "Sarah Ferguson may not have been invited to the Queen Mother's 100th birthday bash at St Paul's last week but she was there all right, in the form of two miniature replicas of her Ferginess. Newspaper pictures of her daughters show Beatrice (11) with long reddish hair, hand up in ya-ish salutation, smiling broadly, while Eugenie (eight) yawns. Both were apparently irrepressible, curtseying more than was strictly necessary. Now where did they get that from? If ever one person's genes wiped the floor with another's, it was when Sarah's eggs met Andrew's sperm. These girls haven't waited until their 30s to become their mother, they've got there before puberty. It was Oscar Wilde who said: \"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.\" Men have translated this into the ultimate insult: \"You're getting just like your mother.\" While they often claim they are chuffed to be getting like their fathers (\"He was quite a good bloke,\" they'll say, even if they hardly knew him), for women the issue is more complex. We may love our mothers but we don't want to become them. Maybe we just don't want to be older women, dyeing away the grey as we saw our mothers do before us. Maybe we think \"getting like your mother\" is a euphemism for getting fatter, more wrinkled, less desirable. To be accused (for that's what it is) of being like our mothers makes us think of all the annoying things our mothers do or did, their irritating gestures, and wonder whether we're doing them now. Biologically, we are likely to reach menopause at the same age our mother did. Are we similarly programmed to assume her mannerisms? Will the combined forces of nature and nurture make us unable to find our glasses, fall asleep after one glass of wine, lose our way in shopping malls? Tell a woman she looks like her mother and she is unlikely to take it as a compliment. Tell her she is behaving like her and she may be inconsolable. \"Do you think you're getting like your mother?\" I ask a friend in her 30s. There's a screech down the phone. \"How can you ask me that? My mother is dysfunctional. She is the world's worst for being negative. I have to work hard not to have a negative mindset. And she has no self-awareness. It's made me so deeply aware that I examine myself in minute detail on a daily basis to make sure none of her character flaws is seeping through.\" These \"character flaws\" are intolerance and being a blame-thrower of Olympic standard.

      "body": "<p>I can still remember the first time I saw the Nicholas Brothers dance. I was 12 years old, watching television after school, having dinner. Bored, I began to flick through the channels. Nothing interested me. Until, on one channel, I saw a choreographer working with a group of dancers from the Alvin Ailey Company. I stopped changing channels and watched. </p> <p>One of the company was being interviewed. He talked about his influences, names I didn't know. Next they showed a clip from Orchestra Wives, a 40s black-and-white film. Two black men, brothers, both dressed in white tie and tails, were singing. Suddenly they began to dance. I stopped chewing my food. For the next few moments, as I watched them dance, I didn't even breathe. </p> <p>I had just seen a jazz routine by the Nicholas Brothers: Fayard, and his younger brother Harold, who died on July 3, aged 79. I love dancing and I've danced since I was six. For a long while after watching them, whenever I danced as a kid, I would try to copy the speed and grace I saw in that clip. But it would be 10 years before I'd see or hear anything more about them. </p> <p>In early spring 1998, I was at Shepperton Studios talking to Kenneth Branagh about his musical film of Love's Labours Lost. I'd been cast as Dumaine and had gone in to talk about the character. Ken and I were discussing the dance solo for I've Got a Crush on You. He gave me free rein to do what I wanted with the dance but asked if I could incorporate a move from a Fred Astaire film. In the clip that Ken showed me, Astaire stepped on to the seat of a chair, put one foot on the back-rest and, while standing, walked over the chair, tipping it gently to the floor. Ken told me that, for him, it captured the feel of the song. He went on to describe how in love Dumaine is and what the dance signified. Ken's energy and enthusiasm is infectious: I left the room feeling like I could walk on water. As I made my way home I was already thinking about the Nicholas Brothers.

In blues, notes were leaned on, stretched and manipulated. Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and blues singers like them found that one note wasn't enough to convey the feeling in a word. So two or three notes were used, four, five, six, any number as long as the emotion came across to the listener.

      "bodyText": "I can still remember the first time I saw the Nicholas Brothers dance. I was 12 years old, watching television after school, having dinner. Bored, I began to flick through the channels. Nothing interested me. Until, on one channel, I saw a choreographer working with a group of dancers from the Alvin Ailey Company. I stopped changing channels and watched. One of the company was being interviewed. He talked about his influences, names I didn't know. Next they showed a clip from Orchestra Wives, a 40s black-and-white film. Two black men, brothers, both dressed in white tie and tails, were singing. Suddenly they began to dance. I stopped chewing my food. For the next few moments, as I watched them dance, I didn't even breathe. I had just seen a jazz routine by the Nicholas Brothers: Fayard, and his younger brother Harold, who died on July 3, aged 79. I love dancing and I've danced since I was six. For a long while after watching them, whenever I danced as a kid, I would try to copy the speed and grace I saw in that clip. But it would be 10 years before I'd see or hear anything more about them. In early spring 1998, I was at Shepperton Studios talking to Kenneth Branagh about his musical film of Love's Labours Lost. I'd been cast as Dumaine and had gone in to talk about the character. Ken and I were discussing the dance solo for I've Got a Crush on You. He gave me free rein to do what I wanted with the dance but asked if I could incorporate a move from a Fred Astaire film. In the clip that Ken showed me, Astaire stepped on to the seat of a chair, put one foot on the back-rest and, while standing, walked over the chair, tipping it gently to the floor. Ken told me that, for him, it captured the feel of the song. He went on to describe how in love Dumaine is and what the dance signified. Ken's energy and enthusiasm is infectious: I left the room feeling like I could walk on water. As I made my way home I was already thinking about the Nicholas Brothers. During rehearsal, I put in the Fred Astaire steps. That went OK. I also put in my own version of some Nicholas Brothers steps - I nearly broke my leg twice! Fayard Nicholas was born in 1914; Harold was born in 1921. Segregation was then the way of life in the US. The boys' parents, Ulysses and Viola Nicholas, were musicians in Philadelphia.

      "body": "<p>President Vladimir Putin arrives in Beijing today for a visit which will set a new course for Sino-Russian relations after 50 years of sharp twists and turns.</p> <p>\"The visit will be a complete success,\" China's foreign minister, Tang Jaixuan, declared at the weekend after talks with his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov. Mr Ivanov said that it would \"determine the strategic development of bilateral relations in the 21st century\".</p> <p>The mood of unqualified optimism reflects a significant warming of relations between Moscow and Beijing, spurred by a common concern about US foreign policy and a revived Russian interest in Asia.</p> <p>The Sino-Soviet dispute in the 1960s which ended the two countries' cold war alliance is officially regarded as ancient history.</p> <p>\"Mr Putin and President Jiang Zemin are in agreement on a lot of issues,\" a senior Chinese diplomat, Cui Tiankai, said. \"They will reaffirm the strategic relationship and discuss US plans for a national missile defence system (NMD), security in Asia and extension of Nato.\"</p> <p>The two leaders are expected to sign joint statements condemning NMD and pledging themselves to strengthen bilateral relations in the future.</p> <p>Asia plays a significant role in the new Russian foreign policy doctrine announced by Mr Ivanov last week. His statement shared China's opposition to a \"unipolar world\" dominated by the US and said that Russia would seek to establish a multi-polar system.</p> <p>Closer relations with China are also seen as essential to reverse the erosion of Russian power in its Asian territories.</p> <p>Russia and China have common security interests in central Asia, both being anxious to promote stability in the former Soviet republics there, and deter terrorism.</p> <p>Relations between China and the former Soviet Union have followed a helter-skelter path since the Chinese communist victory of 1949.</p> <p>In the early 1950s Mao Zedong urged his people to \"learn from the Soviet Union\" - although in private he suspected Stalin of seeking to isolate China.</p> <p>Improved relations between the US and the Soviet Union led to the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s. To fierce ideological polemics, the two countries almost went to war along their 2,500-mile border.</p> <p>The US seized the opportunity to reopen the door to China in the 1970s and 1980s, in a strategic partnership directed against Moscow. It has taken time since the collapse of the Soviet Union for Russia and China to overcome the residual suspicion.</p> <p>\"Our relations with Russia are always important for China,\" said Mr Cui, \"whether in a good sense or a bad sense.

      "bodyText": "President Vladimir Putin arrives in Beijing today for a visit which will set a new course for Sino-Russian relations after 50 years of sharp twists and turns. \"The visit will be a complete success,\" China's foreign minister, Tang Jaixuan, declared at the weekend after talks with his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov. Mr Ivanov said that it would \"determine the strategic development of bilateral relations in the 21st century\". The mood of unqualified optimism reflects a significant warming of relations between Moscow and Beijing, spurred by a common concern about US foreign policy and a revived Russian interest in Asia. The Sino-Soviet dispute in the 1960s which ended the two countries' cold war alliance is officially regarded as ancient history. \"Mr Putin and President Jiang Zemin are in agreement on a lot of issues,\" a senior Chinese diplomat, Cui Tiankai, said. \"They will reaffirm the strategic relationship and discuss US plans for a national missile defence system (NMD), security in Asia and extension of Nato.\" The two leaders are expected to sign joint statements condemning NMD and pledging themselves to strengthen bilateral relations in the future. Asia plays a significant role in the new Russian foreign policy doctrine announced by Mr Ivanov last week. His statement shared China's opposition to a \"unipolar world\" dominated by the US and said that Russia would seek to establish a multi-polar system. Closer relations with China are also seen as essential to reverse the erosion of Russian power in its Asian territories. Russia and China have common security interests in central Asia, both being anxious to promote stability in the former Soviet republics there, and deter terrorism. Relations between China and the former Soviet Union have followed a helter-skelter path since the Chinese communist victory of 1949. In the early 1950s Mao Zedong urged his people to \"learn from the Soviet Union\" - although in private he suspected Stalin of seeking to isolate China. Improved relations between the US and the Soviet Union led to the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s. To fierce ideological polemics, the two countries almost went to war along their 2,500-mile border. The US seized the opportunity to reopen the door to China in the 1970s and 1980s, in a strategic partnership directed against Moscow. It has taken time since the collapse of the Soviet Union for Russia and China to overcome the residual suspicion. \"Our relations with Russia are always important for China,\" said Mr Cui, \"whether in a good sense or a bad sense. But in the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union was dismantled, the Russians were at a loss in what direction they were going.\" A series of summits between the then Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and Mr Jiang was based on a new policy of \"strategic partnership\" agreed in 1996. But the vital stimulus only came last year when the countries found common ground in opposing the US-led Nato bombing of Yugoslavia. Their mutual trade, running at an annual two-way total of $6bn, lags far behind the goal of $20bn set by Mr Jiang and Mr Yeltsin. Russia provides China with a supply of relatively cheap military hardware. The summit may finalise agreement on some pending contracts, including the building of two new destroyers for the Chinese navy. Although diplomats on both sides insist that their new stable relationship will last well into this century, some analysts believe the legacy of history is not so easily overcome. In a report last year for the Carnegie Endowment, the Russian expert Dmitri Trenin described Sino-Russian relations as looking \"sterile and shallow\". Subconscious fears, he argued, still lingered in Russia about the \"yellow peril\" loudly proclaimed by earlier Soviet propaganda. Chinese memories of high-handed Soviet behaviour are perpetuated in widely sold books and magazines. Beijing's fear of Russian expansionism was finally dispelled only by the obvious decline of Moscow's military strength and economic power in the 90s.",

He denied Fairford would be a \"permanent\" base for the stealth bomber and insisted its use by the US airforce would have to be cleared with Britain in advance.</p> <p>Fairford was used by giant US B52 bombers during the Kosovo war last year when stealth bombers flew 30-hour strike missions on Belgrade directly from their Wightman base in Missouri.</p> <p>Fairford is undergoing a \u00a360m upgrading of its runway and fuel bunkers in the largest single military construction project within a Nato country since the end of the cold war.</p> <p>\"Fairford is the only place in Europe we can realistically use for the heavy bombers,\" a US 3rd Air Force headquarters official said at Mildenhall, Suffolk, said last month.</p> <p>Alternatives, such as Moron and Zaragoza in Spain, could face local opposition, the Pentagon believes.

      "bodyText": "The US is planning to use Britain as a base for long-range stealth bombers in a move likely to revive the cold war debate about the UK's role as America's \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\". The Ministry of Defence confirmed yesterday that the Pentagon had chosen Fairford in Gloucestershire - nominally an RAF station - as a possible base for the bombers, America's most expensive warplane, when they were needed to be \"deployed forward\". Washington has yet to discuss the plan with the British government, an MoD spokesman said. He denied Fairford would be a \"permanent\" base for the stealth bomber and insisted its use by the US airforce would have to be cleared with Britain in advance. Fairford was used by giant US B52 bombers during the Kosovo war last year when stealth bombers flew 30-hour strike missions on Belgrade directly from their Wightman base in Missouri. Fairford is undergoing a \u00a360m upgrading of its runway and fuel bunkers in the largest single military construction project within a Nato country since the end of the cold war. \"Fairford is the only place in Europe we can realistically use for the heavy bombers,\" a US 3rd Air Force headquarters official said at Mildenhall, Suffolk, said last month. Alternatives, such as Moron and Zaragoza in Spain, could face local opposition, the Pentagon believes. According to US sources, Fairford has also been chosen as an emergency landing strip for the US space shuttle. Fairford is one of several bases the Pentagon wants to deploy long-range bombers. Another - which the US has used for B52 bombers, notably in the 1991 Gulf war - is Diego Garcia, in the Chagos archipelago which forms the British Indian Ocean Territory. Harold Wilson's Labour government handed over the base to the US in the 1960s for a \u00a35m discount on the Polaris nuclear missile system. The deal was never disclosed to parliament. In the high court today, Chagos islander who were banished to Mauritius will fight for their right to return home. In a separate developemnt yesterday, it was disclosed that shells being tested for the Challenger 2 - the British army's new battle tank - have a serious fault that could endanger their crews. Leaked documents from royal ordnance engineers carrying out the trials show that problems have been detected in ammunition produced by the German company, Nitrochemie, which might cause the tanks' gun barrels to jam. \"A major improvement is required. The risk of some degree of programme delay might thus be significant,\" the engineers say. Jack Dromey, national organiser of the TGWU, who has seen the documents, blamed the problem on the MoD's decision to close the royal ordnance factory at Bishopton, Renfrewshire, the only British plant producing propellant for shells. \"Test-firing at the Ridsdale range [Northumberland] has left soot and debris in the gun barrel, demonstrating fatal flaws in the Nitrochemie propellant,\" he said. \"The specialist engineers who trialled the German product have warned that its use might incinerate tank crews.\" An MoD spokesman said the trials were part of an assessment programme. \"There is no question of the MoD allowing or royal ordnance supplying unsafe propellants to be used in service.\" He added: \"We can categorically say we have no problems with any in-service propellant charge supplied by the royal ordnance.\" The Challenger 2, now with British forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, was years late because of problems with the turret. \u0095 The Foreign Office said yesterday it was investigating a report that a planned \u00a35m sale of military equipment to the Gulf state of Qatar was actually destined for Algeria. It said it was checking a Sunday Times report that rapid deployment vehicles and pickup trucks, as well as night vision sights, would end up in the hands of Algerian forces fighting Islamist rebels.",

Recruitment agency Office Angels has found that those who are familiar with the net are a third more likely to be offered a job than those who still fear email.

Not very, according to the Secretarial Consulting Group in Manchester. The recruitment firm set up a range of training courses for secretaries this year, but has found that their managers are now knocking on the door for IT courses. \"Some cannot open and send emails, or get to grips with Windows, while others just use their computer as a glorified typewriter,\" says MD Sue Williams. \"When they see what their assistants have learned, they see the need to catch up.\" For more details call 0161 839 2309. </p> <p> \u0095 ONE-STOP PA SHOP </p> <p>Launched in April to coincide with National Secretaries' Day, Secretary1 is a new website for admin staff that claims to offer a one-stop shop for everything a PA needs, from advice on filing to contacts for arranging conferences. The site, which already boasts a quarter of a million hits, has now joined with internet stationery supplier Stationery-Store to make ordering paperclips even easier online.

Second comes job security, while several factors - money, comfortable working conditions and equality of opportunity - share third place.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 GET TO THE TOP Fancy yourself as a top PA? Why not enter the new Executive PA of the Year Award and prove it? Judged by PAs themselves, the winner will receive \u00a31,000, plus a free place at the Executive PA in Business conference (worth \u00a31,000), and a year's membership to the Executive PA network (worth \u00a395). Send an outline of your achievements and a letter of endorsement from your boss to organisers IIR by August 25, 2000. Contact Elise Cole on 020 7915 5038 or email ecole@iir-conferences.com. \u0095 KNOW YOUR INTERNET One new internet start-up launches every 29 minutes, but it is not just those who work in new media who need to be well versed in internet skills. Recruitment agency Office Angels has found that those who are familiar with the net are a third more likely to be offered a job than those who still fear email. In some parts of the country, such as \"Silicon Fen\" in Cambridge, 75% of employers say they are interested only in staff who know their way round the internet. \u0095 TECHNO TROUBLE AT TOP How techno-literate are bosses? Not very, according to the Secretarial Consulting Group in Manchester. The recruitment firm set up a range of training courses for secretaries this year, but has found that their managers are now knocking on the door for IT courses. \"Some cannot open and send emails, or get to grips with Windows, while others just use their computer as a glorified typewriter,\" says MD Sue Williams. \"When they see what their assistants have learned, they see the need to catch up.\" For more details call 0161 839 2309. \u0095 ONE-STOP PA SHOP Launched in April to coincide with National Secretaries' Day, Secretary1 is a new website for admin staff that claims to offer a one-stop shop for everything a PA needs, from advice on filing to contacts for arranging conferences. The site, which already boasts a quarter of a million hits, has now joined with internet stationery supplier Stationery-Store to make ordering paperclips even easier online. See www.secretary1.com for more information. \u0095 HAPPY IN OUR WORK According to a new survey, from training company Eden Brown having friendly colleagues is the most important element of a happy workplace. Second comes job security, while several factors - money, comfortable working conditions and equality of opportunity - share third place. Last year, job security held the top spot, which suggests that we may be feeling slightly more safe in our jobs at the moment. \u0095Compiled by Penny Cottee, editor of Executive PA magazine",

At least, that's what a new report from the Treasury believes. </p> <p>The year-long inquiry, which was leaked to the press last week, found that the rate of ill health among workers on the state payroll is a third higher than among their private-sector colleagues. Firefighters scored lowest in the long-term employment stakes with 68% retiring early on ill-health grounds, closely followed by almost half of police officers and more than a third of local government employees. Figures for teachers and NHS workers were only slightly lower, with a 25% and 23% early exodus respectively. </p> <p>The government has responded by saying it will clamp down on skivers who have until now conned sloppy medical officials. In future, medical checks will be more rigorous, and only those who are utterly incapable of work will be waved off into the sunset patting a pension tucked securely into their back pocket. Those with minor ailments will have to stay in their jobs and, if necessary, will be assigned less physically demanding duties. </p> <p>Predictably, the report has sparked fury among public-sector workers, some of whom say they have appealed against medical decisions to retire them early and begged to be allowed to remain in the jobs they love. Unison, the largest union for those working in public services, suspects a disingenuous political motive on the part of the government. </p> <p>\"It is no coincidence that the government is trying to make the most of this story just in advance of the comprehensive spending review where we are asking for more resources to be pumped into our public services,\" says Unison general secretary-elect Dave Prentis. </p> <p>\"We don't think the government should be allowed to get away with whipping up this hysteria and dumping blame on public-sector workers in this way. If there is an abuse of the system, it should be dealt with. But those people who have been retired are not only the victims of stress, violence or injury, but are now the victims of a whispering campaign to portray them as swinging the lead.\" </p> <p>Prentis proposes that, instead of pointing an accusing finger, government ministers should call on employers to introduce good occupational health schemes along with safer working practices, and offer advice and redeployment to prevent ill health in the first place. </p> <p>Nick Page, adviser on pay and employment conditions to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warns that emotion from both sides can cloud a very complex issue which is about much more than how well or ill an employee may be. While he acknowledges that those who are perfectly well should not abuse the system because they'd rather potter round the garden, he says that any perception among employees that the clampdown is merely a cost-cutting exercise will breed huge resentment. </p> <p>\"If there are cases of people who are using the excuse of ill health to progress their retirement, we need to find ways of making public-sector managers manage better so that this doesn't happen,\" he says. \"I think one of the reasons early retirement on ill-health grounds is lower in the private sector is because often they have better managers who keep employees motivated so that they want to stay in their jobs. As an employer, the government is not always good at providing back-up to employees nor does it say to staff very often, 'well done, congratulations, we value you'. </p> <p>\"Teachers and other public-sector workers are political footballs in a way that private-sector workers are not. Often they find that control of their job is out of their hands.\" </p> <p>Even if the stampede for the exit marked early retirement is motivated by a desire to put your feet up, there's nothing so wrong with that, according to Carolyn Jones, director of the Institute of Employment Rights. \"In the 70s, in the heyday of new technology, we were all promised shorter working hours and more leisure. Today, people in this country work much longer hours than our European neighbours. In a civilised society, we should be encouraging people to take early retirement at a time that they can enjoy it rather than being forced to work until they drop.\"</p>",

Judging by the abundance of information, from books to CD-roms to residential courses, on how to become a better boss, one might suppose that there was no reason for anyone to suffer from bad management any longer. Ah, if only. </p> <p>The unfortunate reality, according to a recent survey, is that you are as likely to encounter a bad boss as a good one. The study, carried out by the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist), surveyed 5,000 employees from public, private and voluntary sectors, almost half of whom said they had experienced or witnessed bullying in the past five years. And the perpetrators? Surprise surprise, in three-quarters of cases it was the boss who was to blame. </p> <p>Everyone would like to work for a focused and dynamic boss who is secure enough to encourage the careers of colleagues without feeling threatened in his or her own career. Unfortunately, many employees have to deal with a lesser breed of managers who use bullying and manipulative methods to get their own way and show themselves in the best light. </p> <p>This is where incompetent management becomes actively malevolent. Take your pick from a catalogue of sins: criticising competent staff, taking away responsibilities and assigning trivial tasks instead, shouting at staff, picking on people in front of colleagues, blocking promotion, setting impossible deadlines, and regularly making the same person the butt of jokes. </p> <p>Sound familiar? If so, you are likely to appreciate the devastating effect this kind of behaviour can have on employees - both physically and psychologically. A demotivated workforce simply does not perform as effectively, and there is the risk of a huge loss of resources as experienced staff leave the organisation in despair. </p> <p>Angela Holmes recognises this behaviour all too well. An experienced PA, she had worked for her boss, a senior member of a multi-national corporation, for six years before his arrogant manner became too much to bear. \"He was very demanding and I'd seen him behave appallingly to other people, but he was generally OK with me. I think he knew that he was difficult to work for, and as I was good at my job he didn't want to risk losing me. </p> <p>\"Then one day, when he was on holiday, another colleague asked me to do something for him. Normally I would have been happy to help, but I wasn't able to on that occasion as I was about to go on a computer course. When my boss returned from his holiday, this colleague informed him that I'd been uncooperative. My boss went absolutely ballistic and threw a can of soft drink at me which hurt me quite badly.\" </p> <p>Fortunately for Holmes, this incident was witnessed by several other members of staff and she went straight to the human resources department to lodge a complaint. There was such animosity between Holmes and her boss that it was decided she should go on sick leave until the matter was sorted out. \"I had a lot of support from my colleagues,\" says Holmes, \"but to be honest I felt that HR was very much on the management's side. They kept trying to find fault with me even though I'd done nothing wrong, and went back through all my old appraisal records, which were all glowing. It was extremely stressful.\" </p> <p>She eventually agreed to leave the company with a fairly substantial financial compensation. \"It was a very high-profile company and they were terrified about this getting out. It reflected very badly on them.\" </p> <p>Depressing? Rob Phillips's experience was even worse. For more than two years he has been seeking recompense for psychiatric injuries inflicted by his former boss. \"From the beginning he was a difficult man to get along with. His confrontational attitude was aggressive and disconcerting. He had many unpleasant habits that he displayed as a demonstration of his authority. He took a perverse pleasure in distressing people, and justified it by the notion that this kept people stretched so they could give their best. In fact, this was nothing short of brutal bullying.\" </p> <p>Although Phillips felt suited to his job and was enjoying a certain amount of success, his boss made him feel so incompetent and worthless that in July 1997 he was diagnosed with a \"mixed anxiety and depressive disorder\" and has since been under the care of a psychiatrist. </p> <p>\"The company continues to deny that there was such a regime, although my boss was sacked within days of my bringing the situation to the notice of the chief executive. Nothing can prepare you for working with a serial bully. It is the most devastating, draining, misunderstood and ultimately futile experience imaginable.\" </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, unless you can prove that the motivation behind the behaviour is sexually or racially motivated, there is no law against bullying. But that doesn't mean you should give in without standing your ground. A new book, Where Egos Dare, by Dean B McFarlin and Paul D Sweeney (Kogan Page, \u00a317.99), argues that while ignoring the problem may seem the easiest solution, in the long term it may not be the wisest way to proceed. </p> <p>The book is packed with depressing examples of atrocious managers, but the authors - both academics - offer plenty of constructive advice on how to handle them, ranging from getting the support of colleagues to making contingency plans and, in particular, putting everything in writing. You may ultimately decide you will be happier elsewhere, but making a positive decision to move is at least preferable to being signed off sick because of stress and depression. </p> <p>Angela Ishmael from the Industrial Society stresses that, however malevolent your manager, it is important not to lose your personal power. She agrees that it is important to keeping a diary of aggressive incidents and suggests confiding in a colleague you trust who might be able to help you develop a strategy to cope. Don't be afraid to contact your HR department or another manager, she says - that's what they are there for after all - but if you still feel unsupported it might be worth talking to Citizens Advice or a solicitor. </p> <p>If the all else fails and you feel you really must move on, don't let it shake your own self-esteem, say McFarlin and Sweeney. \"Seize the moral high ground on your way out - demand exit interviews with top managers and tell anyone who will listen about what has happened. Doing so will be cathartic and allow you to leave with a clear conscience.\" And you'll probably feel a lot better for it. </p> <p><strong> Where to get advice </strong><br> </p> <p> * Andrea Adams Trust: 01273 704900 </p> <p>* TUC: 020 7636 4030 </p> <p>* Women Against Sexual Harassment (Wash): 020 7405 0430 </p> <p><strong> Further reading </strong><br> </p> <p> * Where Egos Dare: The Untold Truth about Narcissistic Leaders - and How to Survive Them, by Dean B McFarlin and Paul D Sweeney, Kogan Page, \u00a317.99 </p> <p>* Harassment, Bullying and Violence at Work: A Practical Guide to Combating Employee Abuse, by Angela Ishmael, The Industrial Society, \u00a316.99. </p> <p>* Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It, by Andrea Adams, Virago Press, \u00a38.99. </p> <p>* Adult Bullying: Perpetrators and Victims, by Peter Randall, Routledge, \u00a345.</p>",

In the event, it was to spell the demise of one of the most prestigious sports dot.com companies.</p> <p>Until recently, worldsport.com was a website with offices in London, Monte Carlo and Florida. It boasted contracts to provide websites for dozens of international sports federations, and was negotiating for the rights to webcast their world championship events. But this was not enough for Worldsport's founder and CEO, Alan Callan. What Callan had always desperately wanted was a foot in the door of the Olympic movement. And earlier this year, he finally got his chance when Juan Antonio Samaranch, the all-powerful head of the International Olympic Committee, agreed to meet him in Lausanne.</p> <p>Callan was only a couple of minutes into his presentation, sources say, when Samaranch, in his gentle, patrician manner, leant forward and said: \"Alan, that is all very well, but how will you make your money?\" Samaranch could not have known how pertinent this question was. Around 180 of Worldsport's employees have not received their salaries since the beginning of June, and 10 days ago, the London-registered company went into voluntary arbitration. </p> <p>Half the London staff were made redundant on July 7, but had to wait for another week to find out whether they would get any of the money they were owed. They say that the buzz you get from working on a new launch cannot be matched. But after weeks of 12-, 14- and 16-hour days throughout January, February and March, in the lead-up to the relaunch of the Worldsport site, few of the editorial staff had much energy left to appreciate any buzz.</p> <p>Three months later, still battling with inadequate server capacity and a main computer that could be down for up to five hours a day, the staff were not surprised when the management finally announced that the company had an uncertain future. Several employees immediately boxed up their i-Macs and took them home. Six more computers had disappeared while the announcement was being made. Other machines were later discovered to have been stripped of their memory chips. \"But you know the really sad thing,\" one of my colleagues said, turning to me over a glass of wine on Black Friday, as we tried to work out what to do next, \"there were just so many really nice people there.\" Indeed there were. There were also several major hitters involved: people such as Brendon Parsons, the former Daily Mirror executive responsible for the \"Achtung Surrender\" Euro '96 front page who famously pulled the plug on the Sporting Life; Mike Miller, headhunted from BBC Sport; and Adrian Metcalfe, the Olympic silver medallist who later became an ITV sports commentator and the first head of Channel 4 sport.</p> <p>In June, four months after the relaunch, the site still had no source of revenue: no ads, no subscriptions, no pay-per-view charges to see the jerky webcast of the European indoor tug-of-war, or the Dutch junior korfball championships. And it was impossible to tell whether anyone would pay to watch such esoteric sporting lowlights, since for a long time Callan hadn't allowed anything like a counter on the site, to gauge the number of daily hits. The best estimate before the relaunch was that the site was getting just 1m visits each month, but some thought even this might be optimistic. That would have been entirely in keeping with Callan's approach to the project: optimistic and expansionist.</p> <p>Yet it was also vastly over-extended. The monthly salary bill for the London office was reckoned to be close to \u00a3600,000. It was clear that there were money problems almost as soon as boo.com happened. Suddenly, Callan could no longer find venture capitalists to pour more money into his brainchild, staff were told. Robert Harding, the financial director, much respected in the City for his career in the IMF, described it in a staff meeting in May as \"probably the worst situation in the market I have ever known\". In fact, the situation was so bad that salaries for May were delayed.</p> <p>In April, Callan was diagnosed as having a form of bone cancer, forcing him to stand down as CEO a month later and to say that he would reduce his involvement in the day-to-day running. When accountants from the Texan venture capitalists Hicks Muse swaggered through the offices at the end of June, they were greeted by many on the staff like the Seventh Cavalry coming to the rescue. Yet somehow even that deal managed to fall through. Speculation as to why was rife: some said Callan wanted \u00a3100m; Hicks Muse offered amounts varying between \u00a320m and \u00a340m; Hicks Muse could not see a way of turning things around quickly enough.</p> <p>Whatever, a \"due diligence\" procedure that was supposed to take two weeks ended after seven days. Four days before the staff in London were given the news of redundancies, the Monte Carlo office had begun the process of filing unemployment claims with the French social security system. The business theory behind Worldsport was brilliant. Produce a series of websites for a host of sports federations. Pay them a modest rights fee (about \u00a350,000 each a year) and give them a slice of the webcasting action, and then watch the millions roll in as people click on the site to watch the quarter-finals of the women's doubles at the badminton world championships or the triathlon world cup. Or not.</p> <p>Because ultimately, what Worldsport lacked was a really big-name federation - the sort of deal that Sportal managed to secure with Euro 2000. Too often, Worldsport's unique selling point was that it was \"dull but worthy\". Where else would you see a site's news page led by a report on the qualifying competition for the Olympic women's water polo? Yet Callan had succeeded before, from equally unpromising beginnings. The Bernie Ecclestone lookalike and one-time business manager for Led Zeppelin had become a Monte Carlo tax exile after securing the marketing rights to the first two rugby world cups. He then sold his company to International Management Group, reportedly ensuring he was paid millions annually in residual rights fees. Likewise, while the World Student Games in Sheffield in 1991 may have been a commercial disaster for the city - which is still paying off the debts incurred - Callan reportedly received agency fees worth \u00a32m.</p> <p>But Callan will not be coming out of this venture a richer man. Plans to float the company on the stock market, with lucrative share options, have long been forgotten. Ten days ago, Robert Harding walked out of the office for a final time, saying that he could no longer work with Callan. A few hours later, in a conference call on a speakerphone, Callan fired Norman Howell, the managing editor. Then, last Thursday, the remaining staff were told that Callan had made a payment to the receivers to cover their salaries. Unsurprisingly, Callan was never invited back to sign a deal for the Olympics. As sports pundits are always so keen to point out, no one ever remembers the losers.</p>",

Robert Harding, the financial director, much respected in the City for his career in the IMF, described it in a staff meeting in May as \"probably the worst situation in the market I have ever known\". In fact, the situation was so bad that salaries for May were delayed. In April, Callan was diagnosed as having a form of bone cancer, forcing him to stand down as CEO a month later and to say that he would reduce his involvement in the day-to-day running. When accountants from the Texan venture capitalists Hicks Muse swaggered through the offices at the end of June, they were greeted by many on the staff like the Seventh Cavalry coming to the rescue. Yet somehow even that deal managed to fall through. Speculation as to why was rife: some said Callan wanted \u00a3100m; Hicks Muse offered amounts varying between \u00a320m and \u00a340m; Hicks Muse could not see a way of turning things around quickly enough. Whatever, a \"due diligence\" procedure that was supposed to take two weeks ended after seven days. Four days before the staff in London were given the news of redundancies, the Monte Carlo office had begun the process of filing unemployment claims with the French social security system. The business theory behind Worldsport was brilliant. Produce a series of websites for a host of sports federations. Pay them a modest rights fee (about \u00a350,000 each a year) and give them a slice of the webcasting action, and then watch the millions roll in as people click on the site to watch the quarter-finals of the women's doubles at the badminton world championships or the triathlon world cup. Or not. Because ultimately, what Worldsport lacked was a really big-name federation - the sort of deal that Sportal managed to secure with Euro 2000. Too often, Worldsport's unique selling point was that it was \"dull but worthy\". Where else would you see a site's news page led by a report on the qualifying competition for the Olympic women's water polo? Yet Callan had succeeded before, from equally unpromising beginnings. The Bernie Ecclestone lookalike and one-time business manager for Led Zeppelin had become a Monte Carlo tax exile after securing the marketing rights to the first two rugby world cups. He then sold his company to International Management Group, reportedly ensuring he was paid millions annually in residual rights fees. Likewise, while the World Student Games in Sheffield in 1991 may have been a commercial disaster for the city - which is still paying off the debts incurred - Callan reportedly received agency fees worth \u00a32m. But Callan will not be coming out of this venture a richer man. Plans to float the company on the stock market, with lucrative share options, have long been forgotten. Ten days ago, Robert Harding walked out of the office for a final time, saying that he could no longer work with Callan. A few hours later, in a conference call on a speakerphone, Callan fired Norman Howell, the managing editor. Then, last Thursday, the remaining staff were told that Callan had made a payment to the receivers to cover their salaries. Unsurprisingly, Callan was never invited back to sign a deal for the Olympics. As sports pundits are always so keen to point out, no one ever remembers the losers.",

      "body": "<p>Gill Hudson has compiled a comprehensive list of women's magazine cliches from her years in publishing. In the editorial offices of Eve - which attempt to recreate a W1 publishing house amid the austerity of BBC Worldwide - you can be shot for using the following phrases: \"Shop 'til you drop\", \"The gold standard\", \"Back to basics\", \"Step out in style\", \"On your bike\", \"Get up and glow\" and \"Shape up for summer\". They head a long list to which Hudson has enthusiastically added, \"Other classic cliche suggestions welcome\". </p> <p>Hudson is editing the BBC's biggest consumer magazine to date which launches on August 3 with a marketing budget of more than \u00a32m and an editorial team that reads like a Who's Who of women's publishing. Fiona Hayes, who launched Russian Vogue, Harriett Jagger, former fashion director at Tatler and Harpers, and Justine Southall, previously IPC's ad director across fashion and beauty, bring blue-chip fashion credentials. There's an art team with alumni from i-D and Scene, and a panel of associate editors raided from everything from broadsheets to parenting mags. </p> <p>Consumer marketing research company Mintel published a report in 1998 predicting the impact of changing demographics on the women's magazine market. Women would become older, richer and less housebound. Between 1994 and 1998, all growth in the female population came from women aged between 35 and 65. Mintel said that the twentysomething population - the largest market for women's magazines - would decline sharply by 2002. The constituency of the market would also polarise, with growth in the numbers of affluent ABC1s, and decline among the C2s and Ds. </p> <p>After the launch of Red in 1998, and the highly successful revamp of older women's magazine staple Woman's Journal (circulation rose 29% in the six months since the relaunch), publishers are avidly chasing this market. Earlier this year, Dennis Publishing launched PS, Eve Pollard's Parkhill launched Aura and IPC relaunched 60s style magazine Nova. Gr\u00fcner and Jahr has delayed publication of \"Project Florence\" for six months amid rumours that IPC is in talks to buy the company, but the magazine is now scheduled to launch shortly after Eve. John Brown Publishing's Bare is also due for a late summer launch. </p> <p>A generation weaned on Cosmopolitan and Elle is maturing, and it no longer wants to lurch abruptly from orgasms to origami. The \"how to get four family meals out of a shank of lamb\" school of women's journalism seems a sudden jolt for affluent mothers versed in the black arts of childcare and the Marks &amp; Spencer ready meal. </p> <p>Helena Jaworski-Lang, launch editor of G+J's Project Florence, says: \"Women still grow up but they don't buy the same magazines their mothers buy. I wouldn't want to buy the same magazines my mother bought.\" </p> <p>It's not just about lifestyle. Hudson and others believe there's a widening gap between the \"breathy kind of girliness\" that speaks through the standard crop of older women's magazines and the increasingly diverse babble of real women over the age of 35. If the traditional older women's magazine suppressed the raucous joy of the freedom years in a rictus of self-denial, modern mature women speak in a style that is \"very direct and self-revelatory\", she says. </p> <p>Having overseen the launch of Dennis Publishing's Maxim and Stuff, Hudson felt stultified by the contrast offered by women's mags. \"We don't talk to each other like this and haven't done for years. It's a kind of disease infecting women's magazines and even good writers think, 'Women's magazine piece - the gold standard' and they're off. And you're thinking, 'Hang on, you wrote a brilliant piece for the Observer last week. Why are you writing like this for me?' </p> <p>\"What seems extraordinary to me is that, given that humour is the prime way women communicate, this is not reflected in women's magazines at all. You do get the odd funny slot but it's always either Maureen Lipman or Vanessa Feltz and it's always relegated to the back page.\" </p> <p>Hudson is unwilling to spill the beans on why Eve is going to make us laugh, but think Christine and Neil Hamilton doing a Mr and Mrs, both grilled for hours in airtight rooms about everything from life in the public eye to their sex lives. (\"Is your sex life vanilla, raspberry ripple or knickerbocker glory? Read on.\") </p> <p>Eve will also be different in that it will call on the BBC's resources for editorial support. Hudson is cagey about how this will work in practice, but drops names such as Alan Yentob, director of drama, entertainment and children's programming, and BBC2 chief Jane Root as examples of people who've promised to keep her in the loop. Hudson says that Eve will benefit from the BBC's global infrastructure and that she will have no compunction about raiding it for \"sociology, sexuality, global politics, the environment, anything that will make you go, 'Ooh, well I never' when you hear it at a dinner party\". </p> <p>It will also feature a \"mythbusters\" section, designed, according to Hudson, to give people the \"confidence to go, 'Well that's a load of ...' to some of the stuff you read in the Daily Mail.\" And look out for sexy older women modelling grown-up fashion. </p> <p>But isn't a sexy, aspirational women's magazine from the BBC a contradiction in terms? One women's magazine journalist says: \"The BBC is fundamentally unsexy and Eve risks becoming the Dome of women's publishing - a kind of Blairite manifesto for the modern woman.\" Clearly Hudson isn't going to let this happen without a fight, but for women who equate the BBC with Biddy Baxter and John Birt, it's going to be a tough sell. </p> <p>If TV is any yardstick, Eve could also face censure from commercial publishers wary of it cross-fertilising its editorial from the corporation's considerable resources. Although BBC Worldwide has commercial guidelines to prevent cross-promotion or subsidising of commercial operations from licence-fee funding, senior figures are keeping a beady eye on events. Good Housekeeping's editor-in-chief Lindsay Nicholson (who presided over a relaunch that increased GH's sales to just below 400,000) notes that \"Being part of the BBC is a huge commercial advantage. If it's a good magazine we welcome decent competition. If it's a bad magazine and it distorts the market we will be concerned.\" </p> <p>Privately, journalists on other women's glossies admit they are treating Eve as a real threat. But many warn that it risks making the same mistake as Frank - launched in 1997 by Wagadon as an \"alternative\" women's mag and now awaiting its fate at the hands of Emap, which bought the group last year. </p> <p>Elsa McAlonan, editor of Woman's Journal, is sceptical about the readers' readiness for such a broad remit. \"Current affairs and architecture?\" she wonders. \"I think I'd read a newspaper or look at the internet for that. A good magazine should be a treat, like an expensive bubble bath or a box of chocolates. You've got to make the most of the glossy, visual format.\" </p> <p>Others say the market has more to fear from US-style magazine formats such as Cond\u00e9 Nast's Glamour, due for a spring launch, and Time Warner's In Style. One observer notes: \"The beauty of In Style is that it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, which is a frothy women's magazine. There are so many women's launches that are supposed to be different and we've heard it all before.\" </p> <p>Nicholson says identifying the niche is only half the battle. \"The market is undeniably there. It's just that women in this age group have well-formed opinions. It's a mistake to assume you can just come in and talk to them in the way you can in a younger market.\" </p> <p>Jane Reed, News International's outgoing communications chief and a former editor of Woman and Woman's Own, agrees: \"I think the 30s and 40s are quite separate from the 50s. Going from 35 to 45 is fine. Once you get over 45 you've got to face up to it.\" Reed thinks magazines in the \"post-childrearing sector\" (over 45) have an opportunity to re-engage women in debates and interests they may not previously have had time for, so there is a new diversity. \"But a successful magazine should always have that 'Mars Bar on a wet Saturday afternoon' factor. You've got to think carefully, not just about what women want to read, but when and why they read a magazine.\" </p> <p>Upmarket advertisers are naturally keen to tap into a market of wealthy, liberated and aspirational women. But if Girl Power was an insecure, malleable adolescent, Woman Power is a more mercurial force.

      "bodyText": "Gill Hudson has compiled a comprehensive list of women's magazine cliches from her years in publishing. In the editorial offices of Eve - which attempt to recreate a W1 publishing house amid the austerity of BBC Worldwide - you can be shot for using the following phrases: \"Shop 'til you drop\", \"The gold standard\", \"Back to basics\", \"Step out in style\", \"On your bike\", \"Get up and glow\" and \"Shape up for summer\". They head a long list to which Hudson has enthusiastically added, \"Other classic cliche suggestions welcome\". Hudson is editing the BBC's biggest consumer magazine to date which launches on August 3 with a marketing budget of more than \u00a32m and an editorial team that reads like a Who's Who of women's publishing. Fiona Hayes, who launched Russian Vogue, Harriett Jagger, former fashion director at Tatler and Harpers, and Justine Southall, previously IPC's ad director across fashion and beauty, bring blue-chip fashion credentials. There's an art team with alumni from i-D and Scene, and a panel of associate editors raided from everything from broadsheets to parenting mags. Consumer marketing research company Mintel published a report in 1998 predicting the impact of changing demographics on the women's magazine market. Women would become older, richer and less housebound. Between 1994 and 1998, all growth in the female population came from women aged between 35 and 65. Mintel said that the twentysomething population - the largest market for women's magazines - would decline sharply by 2002. The constituency of the market would also polarise, with growth in the numbers of affluent ABC1s, and decline among the C2s and Ds. After the launch of Red in 1998, and the highly successful revamp of older women's magazine staple Woman's Journal (circulation rose 29% in the six months since the relaunch), publishers are avidly chasing this market. Earlier this year, Dennis Publishing launched PS, Eve Pollard's Parkhill launched Aura and IPC relaunched 60s style magazine Nova. Gr\u00fcner and Jahr has delayed publication of \"Project Florence\" for six months amid rumours that IPC is in talks to buy the company, but the magazine is now scheduled to launch shortly after Eve. John Brown Publishing's Bare is also due for a late summer launch. A generation weaned on Cosmopolitan and Elle is maturing, and it no longer wants to lurch abruptly from orgasms to origami. The \"how to get four family meals out of a shank of lamb\" school of women's journalism seems a sudden jolt for affluent mothers versed in the black arts of childcare and the Marks &amp; Spencer ready meal. Helena Jaworski-Lang, launch editor of G+J's Project Florence, says: \"Women still grow up but they don't buy the same magazines their mothers buy. I wouldn't want to buy the same magazines my mother bought.\" It's not just about lifestyle. Hudson and others believe there's a widening gap between the \"breathy kind of girliness\" that speaks through the standard crop of older women's magazines and the increasingly diverse babble of real women over the age of 35. If the traditional older women's magazine suppressed the raucous joy of the freedom years in a rictus of self-denial, modern mature women speak in a style that is \"very direct and self-revelatory\", she says. Having overseen the launch of Dennis Publishing's Maxim and Stuff, Hudson felt stultified by the contrast offered by women's mags. \"We don't talk to each other like this and haven't done for years. It's a kind of disease infecting women's magazines and even good writers think, 'Women's magazine piece - the gold standard' and they're off. And you're thinking, 'Hang on, you wrote a brilliant piece for the Observer last week. Why are you writing like this for me?' \"What seems extraordinary to me is that, given that humour is the prime way women communicate, this is not reflected in women's magazines at all. You do get the odd funny slot but it's always either Maureen Lipman or Vanessa Feltz and it's always relegated to the back page.\" Hudson is unwilling to spill the beans on why Eve is going to make us laugh, but think Christine and Neil Hamilton doing a Mr and Mrs, both grilled for hours in airtight rooms about everything from life in the public eye to their sex lives. (\"Is your sex life vanilla, raspberry ripple or knickerbocker glory? Read on.\") Eve will also be different in that it will call on the BBC's resources for editorial support. Hudson is cagey about how this will work in practice, but drops names such as Alan Yentob, director of drama, entertainment and children's programming, and BBC2 chief Jane Root as examples of people who've promised to keep her in the loop. Hudson says that Eve will benefit from the BBC's global infrastructure and that she will have no compunction about raiding it for \"sociology, sexuality, global politics, the environment, anything that will make you go, 'Ooh, well I never' when you hear it at a dinner party\". It will also feature a \"mythbusters\" section, designed, according to Hudson, to give people the \"confidence to go, 'Well that's a load of ...' to some of the stuff you read in the Daily Mail.\" And look out for sexy older women modelling grown-up fashion. But isn't a sexy, aspirational women's magazine from the BBC a contradiction in terms? One women's magazine journalist says: \"The BBC is fundamentally unsexy and Eve risks becoming the Dome of women's publishing - a kind of Blairite manifesto for the modern woman.\" Clearly Hudson isn't going to let this happen without a fight, but for women who equate the BBC with Biddy Baxter and John Birt, it's going to be a tough sell. If TV is any yardstick, Eve could also face censure from commercial publishers wary of it cross-fertilising its editorial from the corporation's considerable resources. Although BBC Worldwide has commercial guidelines to prevent cross-promotion or subsidising of commercial operations from licence-fee funding, senior figures are keeping a beady eye on events. Good Housekeeping's editor-in-chief Lindsay Nicholson (who presided over a relaunch that increased GH's sales to just below 400,000) notes that \"Being part of the BBC is a huge commercial advantage. If it's a good magazine we welcome decent competition. If it's a bad magazine and it distorts the market we will be concerned.\" Privately, journalists on other women's glossies admit they are treating Eve as a real threat. But many warn that it risks making the same mistake as Frank - launched in 1997 by Wagadon as an \"alternative\" women's mag and now awaiting its fate at the hands of Emap, which bought the group last year. Elsa McAlonan, editor of Woman's Journal, is sceptical about the readers' readiness for such a broad remit. \"Current affairs and architecture?\" she wonders. \"I think I'd read a newspaper or look at the internet for that. A good magazine should be a treat, like an expensive bubble bath or a box of chocolates. You've got to make the most of the glossy, visual format.\" Others say the market has more to fear from US-style magazine formats such as Cond\u00e9 Nast's Glamour, due for a spring launch, and Time Warner's In Style. One observer notes: \"The beauty of In Style is that it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, which is a frothy women's magazine. There are so many women's launches that are supposed to be different and we've heard it all before.\" Nicholson says identifying the niche is only half the battle. \"The market is undeniably there. It's just that women in this age group have well-formed opinions. It's a mistake to assume you can just come in and talk to them in the way you can in a younger market.\" Jane Reed, News International's outgoing communications chief and a former editor of Woman and Woman's Own, agrees: \"I think the 30s and 40s are quite separate from the 50s. Going from 35 to 45 is fine. Once you get over 45 you've got to face up to it.\" Reed thinks magazines in the \"post-childrearing sector\" (over 45) have an opportunity to re-engage women in debates and interests they may not previously have had time for, so there is a new diversity. \"But a successful magazine should always have that 'Mars Bar on a wet Saturday afternoon' factor. You've got to think carefully, not just about what women want to read, but when and why they read a magazine.\" Upmarket advertisers are naturally keen to tap into a market of wealthy, liberated and aspirational women. But if Girl Power was an insecure, malleable adolescent, Woman Power is a more mercurial force. The planners and buyers know it's a vast, uncharted territory, but it's much harder to pin down. Eve Pollard recalls going to buy her first convertible: \"The young man in the showroom was staring at me and I went up to him and said, 'You think I'm too old for this, don't you?' And he said, 'No, Ms Pollard, you're just the sort of customer we want,' but he was a bit scared by this point. I think some of the kids in ad agencies can't believe there are women alive after the age of 35.\" And as the market diversifies, titles will have to make do with smaller circulations, according to Bryony Brampton, press buying director for media agency Universal McCann. \"The market will support these launches up to a point but they will go for lower circulations than the Marie Claires and Cosmopolitans.\" This in turn creates a need for magazines to attract higher-end advertising. But Caroline Baker, formerly fashion editor on the old Nova and now fashion director at the Mail on Sunday's You magazine, believes this may be wishful thinking. \"The British magazine publishing establishment is hard to break into because of the relationship between publishing houses and the fashion industry,\" she says. \"The fashion industry hasn't traditionally been large enough to support that many glossier, smaller circulation magazines, and with British manufacturing in decline, the situation isn't going to improve.\" Advertisers are privately worried about Aura, which has seen two sales directors and an editor depart since its launch. John Brown's Bare - which targets women (and advertisers) interested in natural health, is also said to be a worry because of the \"very nichey\" nature of its pitch. But in spite of favourable demographic predictions, there are more general worries about the future of women's glossies.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, black people in the UK used to dub the internet the \"world white web\". Cyberspace was an ethnically-cleansed environment aside from a few black American sites. </p> <p>\"The mainstream media have let us down,\" says Caroline Joseph of Blacknet. \"Even when broadcasters like the BBC or Channel 4 run black stories on the web they are from a white perspective.\" </p> <p>Things are changing now, with a plethora of UK-based Afro-Caribbean websites making their own impact. Blacknet, Blink, Blackbritain and Voice-online are all news and information sites attracting hundreds of thousands of page views daily. But why did black British people take so much longer than their white counterparts to get online? </p> <p>Karl Wilson of Blacknet.co.uk thinks there were two key reasons: \"First, the internet was an invisible status symbol. It wasn't like a mobile phone or a new car or the latest gizmo which you can physically show off. Of course that's all changing now with Wap technology. In the early days, in the mid-90s when my brother and I used to leaflet the night clubs to promote our new site, most of the black people leaving the club had never heard of the internet. Secondly, black people weren't being given job opportunities in the IT sector and therefore didn't see it as a career.\" </p> <p>Launched in February 1997, Blacknet is now one of the UK's favourite black community sites, with thousands of discussions and forums taking place on its site every week. The site also offers news and information, a dating agency, soul food recipes and a monthly community networking event which attracts a range of people, from senior managers to students and the elderly. </p> <p>However, in the early days just using the word \"black\" for your website was considered risky. Advertisers seemed not to like anything with the word in it. </p> <p>But Blacknet was clear that its goal was not to make its founders dot.com millionaires. It was determined to be a grassroots community networking group with close personal links to the people the site serves. </p> <p>The strategy has paid off. Channel 4 turned to Blacknet for promotional support when it launched the Richard Blackwood series. An upmarket, formal ball for black professionals held at the City of London's Mansion House attracted more than 1,000 people who were accessed through Blacknet's massive database. \"We are close to our users and we contact them regularly with offers of events and opportunities to meet, so they really trust our brand. We're not just a faceless software package,\" says Wilson. </p> <p>It's true that the black websites offer far more specific and targeted information than mainstream news sites. You can read a history of homosexuality in Africa, find out where in Birmingham to get extensions put in your hair, and discover more about sickle cell anaemia, a condition that specifically affects black people. </p> <p>But despite the claims of all the webmasters that their sites are attracting anything from 100,000 to 200,000 page views a day, blue-chip companies like British Airways, Marks &amp; Spencer and BMW are conspicuously absent from any banner advertising. Part of the reason may be that many black websites are not properly audited for usage and that their webmasters are keen to promote their own sites. Each one I spoke to claimed to be both the first black British information site and the most accessed. </p> <p>None the less, it is obvious that many of these sites are attracting large groups of people who are hard to reach through mainstream advertising campaigns.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, black people in the UK used to dub the internet the \"world white web\". Cyberspace was an ethnically-cleansed environment aside from a few black American sites. \"The mainstream media have let us down,\" says Caroline Joseph of Blacknet. \"Even when broadcasters like the BBC or Channel 4 run black stories on the web they are from a white perspective.\" Things are changing now, with a plethora of UK-based Afro-Caribbean websites making their own impact. Blacknet, Blink, Blackbritain and Voice-online are all news and information sites attracting hundreds of thousands of page views daily. But why did black British people take so much longer than their white counterparts to get online? Karl Wilson of Blacknet.co.uk thinks there were two key reasons: \"First, the internet was an invisible status symbol. It wasn't like a mobile phone or a new car or the latest gizmo which you can physically show off. Of course that's all changing now with Wap technology. In the early days, in the mid-90s when my brother and I used to leaflet the night clubs to promote our new site, most of the black people leaving the club had never heard of the internet. Secondly, black people weren't being given job opportunities in the IT sector and therefore didn't see it as a career.\" Launched in February 1997, Blacknet is now one of the UK's favourite black community sites, with thousands of discussions and forums taking place on its site every week. The site also offers news and information, a dating agency, soul food recipes and a monthly community networking event which attracts a range of people, from senior managers to students and the elderly. However, in the early days just using the word \"black\" for your website was considered risky. Advertisers seemed not to like anything with the word in it. But Blacknet was clear that its goal was not to make its founders dot.com millionaires. It was determined to be a grassroots community networking group with close personal links to the people the site serves. The strategy has paid off. Channel 4 turned to Blacknet for promotional support when it launched the Richard Blackwood series. An upmarket, formal ball for black professionals held at the City of London's Mansion House attracted more than 1,000 people who were accessed through Blacknet's massive database. \"We are close to our users and we contact them regularly with offers of events and opportunities to meet, so they really trust our brand. We're not just a faceless software package,\" says Wilson. It's true that the black websites offer far more specific and targeted information than mainstream news sites. You can read a history of homosexuality in Africa, find out where in Birmingham to get extensions put in your hair, and discover more about sickle cell anaemia, a condition that specifically affects black people. But despite the claims of all the webmasters that their sites are attracting anything from 100,000 to 200,000 page views a day, blue-chip companies like British Airways, Marks &amp; Spencer and BMW are conspicuously absent from any banner advertising. Part of the reason may be that many black websites are not properly audited for usage and that their webmasters are keen to promote their own sites. Each one I spoke to claimed to be both the first black British information site and the most accessed. None the less, it is obvious that many of these sites are attracting large groups of people who are hard to reach through mainstream advertising campaigns. In addition, their users spend longer on the sites than users of more popular mainstream sites - and they tend to be educated and well-off. The commission for racial quality estimates that in 10 years' time, 40% of people in urban Britain under the age of 25 will be black or Asian. It's a young market that few companies can afford to ignore - and yet they do ignore it. Is it racism or short-sightedness that has kept black British websites a virtually ad-free zone?

And all of them were ditto in the American press in spring 2000. Danielewski's book, published last week in the UK, came out in the US in March. It's The Blair Witch Project in print; grungy, low-gloss, amateur-night Stephen King but clever with it. Like the movie it will be big - first there, then here. </p> <p>High Fidelity, Nick Hornby's cosy lament for vinyl, has been relocated to Chicago. The film came out in April in the US. Probably not one in a 100 of the audience knew or cared about its alien origin. America bought the British product, repackaged it and, when it is good and ready, it'll sell it back to Britain. Sheep that we are, we will queue up patiently and buy. </p> <p>British villains are flavour of the month in Hollywood. Gone in 60 Seconds is a carjack thriller. The bad guys (very, very bad) all have Italian names and south-London accents. Vinnie Jones is recruited as the good bad guy. Unfortunately, American audiences can't be trusted to understand his accent so he has to act dumb (literally) throughout (there's a nice twist at the end). The movie came out in late May. We'll get the scratched prints when it drops off American screens sometime soon. Or perhaps not. We'll be patient and grateful. </p> <p>Product sequencing suits the merchandisers. It is convenient to have your main markets lined up like dominoes and your consumers patient as sheep. British distributors and publishers know, ahead of time, what the big items will be and can allocate advertising budgets accordingly. The stars and bestselling authors, having fulfilled their US schedules, are available for a UK tour - if they can be bothered to make the trip. </p> <p>The future of British fiction, as Martin Amis put it, is American. And film, and television. We follow our (American) leader. But it's more complex than that. Harry Potter's latest instalment, for instance, was simultaneously released in the US and UK on July 8. It is number one in both markets, was originated here and is ultra-English. Norman G Finkelstein's The Holocaust Industry, a book aimed directly at American readers and interests, has been available in the UK marginally earlier than in the US. That's because it is published - here and there - by a small left-wing British press, Verso (perhaps because the big publishing houses, on both sides of the Atlantic, were terrified of Jewish-American backlash). </p> <p>If one stands back a bit one can see the imminent convergence of two vast cultural forces: globalisation and e-commerce. British customers could, for example, have ordered House of Leaves from Amazon.com (but not its British subsidiary, Amazon.co.uk) in March. Doubtless some did. In a year or two's time you will be able to download the latest movie releases as easily as you can now get chart-toppers on Napster. Sequencing, in either direction, will soon be irrelevant. Customers will go round it. </p> <p>This leads to the fundamental question: why have retailing, or e-tailing, at all? Americans are just waking up to the fact that (like us) they are royally ripped off when they buy cars. You go online and do research and decide what model you want. But, having done your research, you must go to a dealer (or its website) to buy your vehicle. Every American state has laws that make it illegal to buy cars direct from the manufacturer. What is the dealer doing - other than raking in a 40% commission? So too with books and movies. You cannot buy from the publisher or the studio. You have to go to a bookseller (walk-in or virtual), a cinema, or a video store and pay a whopping middleman commission. Customers will, quite soon, find a web-route round him as well. </p> <p>I think Amazon is doomed - at least as an e-tailer. Who wants electronic bookshops? What one wants is a cataloguing or finding service (charging a lot less than the 40% bookseller's mark-up) that will direct one to the manufacturer. No wait, no surcharge. I've seen the future, and it's impatience.</p>",
