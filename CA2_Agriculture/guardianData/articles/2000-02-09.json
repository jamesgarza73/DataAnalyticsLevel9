      "body": "<p>Celtic suffered the worst defeat in their history, losing their third-round cup tie to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who were in the Highland League only five years ago. They did so by some margin in front of their own distraught unbelieving and angry supporters, and their manager John Barnes may find that there is no way back. </p> <p>Some 5,000 had followed Thistle down for the original tie, which was called off when part of a grandstand came loose hours before the game. And half that number returned to see whether, metaphorically at least, the roof would fall in on the Premier League side. Their effort was handsomely rewarded. </p> <p>Twice in the first half Thistle took the lead, and they did not need to play much more than straightforward First Division football. In that period Celtic's defence was truly dreadful, looking like men who had not struck up the barest acquaintanceship with one another. Olivier Tebily must surely have wished he was back in an Ivory Coast army camp. </p> <p>Thistle were neither overawed nor did they feel obliged to do anything at all fussy. They did not need to do so to take the lead in the 17th minute. Stuart Golabek simply played the ball down the line on the left to Paul Sheerin, the busiest of their midfielders. He hit an orthodox cross into the penalty area and the striker Bobby Wilson had nobody with him as he headed strongly past Jonathan Gould. </p> <p>It seemed it had been an aberration when Celtic equalised less than 60 seconds later. With Thistle still celebrating and not really believing their luck, Eyal Berkovic struck a through-ball down the middle.

      "bodyText": "Celtic suffered the worst defeat in their history, losing their third-round cup tie to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who were in the Highland League only five years ago. They did so by some margin in front of their own distraught unbelieving and angry supporters, and their manager John Barnes may find that there is no way back. Some 5,000 had followed Thistle down for the original tie, which was called off when part of a grandstand came loose hours before the game. And half that number returned to see whether, metaphorically at least, the roof would fall in on the Premier League side. Their effort was handsomely rewarded. Twice in the first half Thistle took the lead, and they did not need to play much more than straightforward First Division football. In that period Celtic's defence was truly dreadful, looking like men who had not struck up the barest acquaintanceship with one another. Olivier Tebily must surely have wished he was back in an Ivory Coast army camp. Thistle were neither overawed nor did they feel obliged to do anything at all fussy. They did not need to do so to take the lead in the 17th minute. Stuart Golabek simply played the ball down the line on the left to Paul Sheerin, the busiest of their midfielders. He hit an orthodox cross into the penalty area and the striker Bobby Wilson had nobody with him as he headed strongly past Jonathan Gould. It seemed it had been an aberration when Celtic equalised less than 60 seconds later. With Thistle still celebrating and not really believing their luck, Eyal Berkovic struck a through-ball down the middle. He gained a lucky deflection from a defender and it dropped into the stride of Mark Burchill, who clipped it past Jim Calder. That should have been the sign for Celtic to calm down but it only increased their apprehension. Six minutes later the First Division side were back in the lead. Sheerin won a corner and tossed the ball over, Golabek was unmarked for his header and was lucky when the ball took a wicked deflection off Lubomir Moravcik to end up in the net. Worse followed for Celtic. In the 55th minute Wilson's pace worried them, Reggie Blinker brought him down from behind and the impressive Sheerin scored from the penalty spot.",

This is a very serious weapon we are using and it is not a weapon you use lightly or often.\" Ann Jones, chairman of the Labour group in the assembly, claimed Plaid had chosen to plunge the assembly into chaos by imposing a wholly arbitrary deadline on the objective 1 process. \u0095 Wales is one of four UK areas earmarked to receive hundreds of millions of pounds from Brussels under the EU's Objective 1 aid programme. \u0095 The programme is aimed at reinvigorating the least developed regions of Europe where GDP per head is less than 75 % of the EU average. \u0095 The seven-year programme, which runs until the end of 2006, was agreed at the Berlin summit when west Wales and the valleys was included along with Cornwall, Merseyside and South Yorkshire. \u0095 The four regions, desperate to be included before EU enlargement brought even poorer economies into the calculations, have been promised more than \u00a33 bn between them - \u00a31.2 bn of it for Wales. \u0095 In order to draw down the EU money member states are required to come up with match funding for the regeneration projects. \u0095 Opposition parties in Wales insist this funding should come from the treasury and be in addition to \u00a38bn handed over to the assembly under the formula that governs the size of the Welsh budget. \u0095 Labour says the issue will be resolved in the government's spending review, but there are already sufficient funds to kick-start the programme this year.",

      "bodyText": "Alun Michael, first secretary of the Welsh Assembly, dramatically resigned this afternoon - moments before losing a vote of confidence. Up to the last minute, it was widely forecast that Mr Michael would step down after the vote, then immediately stand again as the ruling Labour group's unopposed candidate for the top job. That is still possible, but the smart money is now on Mr Michael's long-standing rival, Rhodri Morgan. Such an outcome would be a bitter blow for Downing Street, where Mr Michael is seen as a staunch New Labour loyalist, and Mr Morgan as a dangerous independent. And that is precisely the analysis which led this afternoon's shenanigans in Cardiff. Mr Michael was accused by the opposition parties in the assembly of failing to extract cash from the treasury for development projects in chronically poor areas of west Wales and the Valleys. The European Union has earmarked millions for development, but will only release the funds if they are matched by the national exchequer. The hapless first secretary, who got the job because he was close to Tony Blair, is now perceived to be too close to be an effective champion of Welsh interests - a perception rather crudely exploited today by an ad hoc alliance of Plaid Cymru nationalists, liberal democrats and conservatives. Although between them the three parties can muster a narrow majority in the assembly, they are deeply divided on policy. It is unthinkable that they could come up with an agreed candidate for the first secretaryship. So it will be Labour, again, which forms the next Welsh administration. Still, there is more than a touch of arrogance about the ruling party's assumption of control despite having a minority of members. Mr Michael told the assembly this afternoon, as he brandished his written resignation: \"It is for the Labour Party to decide who should be presented to this assembly as our candidate for the role of first secretary.\" Welsh secretary Paul Murphy, who witnessed the resignation, said afterwards that \"it is our party, and our party alone, that decides who leads us in the assembly\". Indeed Labour is entitled to choose its own leader - but so is the assembly, and today the latter decided that it had no confidence in Alun Michael. If Labour's mandarins put him back in the firing line, they will be sneering at the entire devolution process. Even more ominously for Mr Michael's chances, an unnamed Labour member actually abstained in the vote. That clearly indicates that there are continuing rumbles of dissent in the party, a significant section of which passionately supports Mr Morgan, and believes that Mr Michael was foisted on them by the control freaks of Millbank.

Three days after snatching a home defeat from the jaws of victory against Hearts, his team really surpassed themselves by crashing out of the Scottish Cup 3-1 at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle. And to top the biggest shock in Scottish football for 33 years - since Rangers bowed out of the same competition against Berwick in 1967 - top scorer Mark Viduka was substituted at the break after what Barnes described as \"a serious situation\" over the half-time cuppa.</p> <p>Barnes has promised what exactly happened with Viduka \"will all come out in the next few days\". As Viduka's agent insists the Australian striker \"had a knee injury, that was all\", it's a story likely to make everything worse instead of better. But by then will anybody care? Because all this is a trifling affair compared to presiding over the worst result in your club's history, and if a statement issued by Bhoys chief executive Allan MacDonald is to be believed Barnes is currently positioned somewhere between 'very shaky ground' and 'wet tissue paper suspended in mid-air over thin ice'. </p> <p>\"Last night's performance was totally unacceptable... and simply not good enough for the Celtic support,\" thundered MacDonald today. \"I am addressing this situation as a matter of urgency with our director of football, Kenny Dalglish, who is returning this evening from club business overseas.\" You can be sure that Kenny will be returning from his scouting-mission-stroke-golfing-holiday quicker than you can link the words \"vote\" and \"confidence\" with a preposition. So we'll keep an eye on this one.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WHAT PRICE A MONKEY'S HEAD?</strong></p> <p>Firm and fruity Sunderland manager Peter Reid is much in demand. Whether it's a request to chair the UK Swearing 2000 Conference - \"Whither ****, **** and ************ in the new Millennium?\" - or to help ACAS out in a tricky contract dispute, Reid is the man they all want. Sunderland, who currently employ Reid for his managerial skills, want him too. So much so, in fact, that they are prepared to offer him a contract that will make him the richest manager of all time ever.</p> <p>Maybe. What is certain is that negotiations are about to start to keep Reid at the Stadium of Light for the foreseeable future. \"Performances in our first season back in the Premier League have gone well,\" said a spokesman today, \"and we feel the time is now right to reward him and secure his services for the future.\" Chairman Bob Murray is of a similar mind: 'We have to make sure we give the guy what he wants or we'll lose him,\" he said. What if he wants a new set of ears?</p> <p>Anyway, rumours suggest that the urgency on Wearside is a result of the recent attention lavished upon Reid by Uncle Jack Walker. Walker is believed to have offered Reid \u00a31m-a-year to manage Blackburn, and will surely make another offer in the summer should they get promoted. Why Reid would want to leave the thriving Stadium of Light (average attendance: 38,162) to go to Ewood Park (average attendance: 18,942 - including injured squad members) is beyond the Fiver. However, some big club in the North West are said to be looking for a manager quite soon. He might be tempted to hang on for that.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We could try putting such replays on hold. It would help towards a general reconciliation and put the emphasis back on the skills and technique of the most beautiful game in the world.\" - Juventus' Ciro Ferrara mooting a ban on television replays. Why he couldn't just say \"Vid Pic Ban Blast!\" we'll never know.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE</strong></p> <p>Reported debts of \u00a372m; share price at an all time low of 56.5p (down from an initial price of 135p); and unable to afford a fee of \u00a33m to sign Argentinian international midfielder Christian Bassedas (approximately the same price Kenny Dalglish forked out for Andreas Andersson). Things might seem to be looking a little grey for the Magpies of Toon. But, in reality, things are terribly rosy. And that is the truth.</p> <p>A spokesman was urgently wheeled out this afternoon to explain away any financial difficulties. \"When Newcastle United plc reported its last results in October 1999, the company had cash balances of nearly \u00a36m,\" he said. A \"securitisation bond\" (ie: big-time loan) of \u00a355m was arranged last winter to \"fund the redevelopment of St James' Park\", he added. This will \"pay for itself\", thanks partly to putting executive boxes where supporters used to sit. What's more, one of those \"exclusive media agent\" deals with NTL has earned Newcastle a loan of \u00a310m, \"with a further \u00a315m following in 12 months' time.\"</p> <p>So, basically, after years of overspending, Newcastle are being kept afloat on the never-never. Any future prosperity depends on increased attendances, which in turn depend on success on the pitch. A lot of pressure to put on the shoulders of a soon-to-be-67-year-old man. One thing's for sure however, you won't catch the Toon going through \u00a325m a season in transfers again. \"As a club we never say how much we have to spend on players,\" said today's spokesman. 14 times bitten...</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Middlesbrough are interested in Monaco striker David Trezeguet.</p> <p>Ruud van Nistelrooy has revealed he would prefer a move to Chelsea than to Italy, according to the Daily Mail. Sources report that the Dutch international striker believes life in Serie A would be too fraught and that he would like to live in London.</p> <p>George Graham will pay \u00a32m to take Manchester United winger Jonathan Greening to Tottenham.</p> <p>Sheffield Wednesday are set to spend \u00a3600,000 on Derby defender Spencer Prior.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Paolo di Canio has been charged with misconduct by the FA for an alleged insulting gesture during the Premiership game against Aston Villa.

As Viduka's agent insists the Australian striker \"had a knee injury, that was all\", it's a story likely to make everything worse instead of better. But by then will anybody care? Because all this is a trifling affair compared to presiding over the worst result in your club's history, and if a statement issued by Bhoys chief executive Allan MacDonald is to be believed Barnes is currently positioned somewhere between 'very shaky ground' and 'wet tissue paper suspended in mid-air over thin ice'. \"Last night's performance was totally unacceptable... and simply not good enough for the Celtic support,\" thundered MacDonald today. \"I am addressing this situation as a matter of urgency with our director of football, Kenny Dalglish, who is returning this evening from club business overseas.\" You can be sure that Kenny will be returning from his scouting-mission-stroke-golfing-holiday quicker than you can link the words \"vote\" and \"confidence\" with a preposition. So we'll keep an eye on this one. * * * * * * * * * * * * * WHAT PRICE A MONKEY'S HEAD? Firm and fruity Sunderland manager Peter Reid is much in demand. Whether it's a request to chair the UK Swearing 2000 Conference - \"Whither ****, **** and ************ in the new Millennium?\" - or to help ACAS out in a tricky contract dispute, Reid is the man they all want. Sunderland, who currently employ Reid for his managerial skills, want him too. So much so, in fact, that they are prepared to offer him a contract that will make him the richest manager of all time ever. Maybe. What is certain is that negotiations are about to start to keep Reid at the Stadium of Light for the foreseeable future. \"Performances in our first season back in the Premier League have gone well,\" said a spokesman today, \"and we feel the time is now right to reward him and secure his services for the future.\" Chairman Bob Murray is of a similar mind: 'We have to make sure we give the guy what he wants or we'll lose him,\" he said. What if he wants a new set of ears? Anyway, rumours suggest that the urgency on Wearside is a result of the recent attention lavished upon Reid by Uncle Jack Walker. Walker is believed to have offered Reid \u00a31m-a-year to manage Blackburn, and will surely make another offer in the summer should they get promoted. Why Reid would want to leave the thriving Stadium of Light (average attendance: 38,162) to go to Ewood Park (average attendance: 18,942 - including injured squad members) is beyond the Fiver. However, some big club in the North West are said to be looking for a manager quite soon. He might be tempted to hang on for that. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We could try putting such replays on hold. It would help towards a general reconciliation and put the emphasis back on the skills and technique of the most beautiful game in the world.\" - Juventus' Ciro Ferrara mooting a ban on television replays. Why he couldn't just say \"Vid Pic Ban Blast!\" we'll never know. * * * * * * * * * * * * * SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE Reported debts of \u00a372m; share price at an all time low of 56.5p (down from an initial price of 135p); and unable to afford a fee of \u00a33m to sign Argentinian international midfielder Christian Bassedas (approximately the same price Kenny Dalglish forked out for Andreas Andersson). Things might seem to be looking a little grey for the Magpies of Toon. But, in reality, things are terribly rosy. And that is the truth. A spokesman was urgently wheeled out this afternoon to explain away any financial difficulties. \"When Newcastle United plc reported its last results in October 1999, the company had cash balances of nearly \u00a36m,\" he said. A \"securitisation bond\" (ie: big-time loan) of \u00a355m was arranged last winter to \"fund the redevelopment of St James' Park\", he added. This will \"pay for itself\", thanks partly to putting executive boxes where supporters used to sit. What's more, one of those \"exclusive media agent\" deals with NTL has earned Newcastle a loan of \u00a310m, \"with a further \u00a315m following in 12 months' time.\" So, basically, after years of overspending, Newcastle are being kept afloat on the never-never. Any future prosperity depends on increased attendances, which in turn depend on success on the pitch. A lot of pressure to put on the shoulders of a soon-to-be-67-year-old man. One thing's for sure however, you won't catch the Toon going through \u00a325m a season in transfers again. \"As a club we never say how much we have to spend on players,\" said today's spokesman. 14 times bitten... * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Middlesbrough are interested in Monaco striker David Trezeguet. Ruud van Nistelrooy has revealed he would prefer a move to Chelsea than to Italy, according to the Daily Mail. Sources report that the Dutch international striker believes life in Serie A would be too fraught and that he would like to live in London. George Graham will pay \u00a32m to take Manchester United winger Jonathan Greening to Tottenham. Sheffield Wednesday are set to spend \u00a3600,000 on Derby defender Spencer Prior. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Paolo di Canio has been charged with misconduct by the FA for an alleged insulting gesture during the Premiership game against Aston Villa. The West Ham striker has 14 days to respond. Sunderland midfielder Carsten Fredgaard has joined West Brom on loan until the end of the season. The SFA have insisted that Morton's Scottish Cup fourth-round tie with Rangers must be played at St Mirren's Love Street ground and not Hampden Park as planned. Morton, whose Cappielow ground was deemed too small for the tie, plan to protest. York have parted company with manager Neil Thompson \"by mutual agreement.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (6.30pm, 8.30pm SS2, 12.15am) A programme which takes international football into its bosom and loves it like a son.

It's the New Deal, stupid! </p> <p>Last spring, I joined the New Deal for the 25-plus and visited the smartly refurbished and colour coordinated upper floor of the job centre for my first interview with my personal adviser - from whom I do not recall receiving any useful advice. I was at the \"Gateway\", where I was to spend 13 weeks supposedly taking action to overcome any barriers to work. </p> <p>I was enrolled at a programme centre - an updated version of a job club - run by a charitable organisation (everything is contracted out these days). </p> <p>Each person was allocated a facilitator. Mine didn't have much to do with me. Why? I tried to approach him, but I was told bluntly: \"I can see you know what you're doing so I let you get on with it\". So for the rest of my time at the programme centre - once a week for seven months - I continued to get on with whatever it was I was supposed to be doing. </p> <p>After three months, it was time to leave the Gateway. \"A full-time course?\" I suggested to my personal adviser, who retorted that I was too well qualified. It had to be a work placement, so I chose the provider organisation which offered work placements with the city council. I wanted to get in there and start asking questions. Why was a Labour council involved in the New Deal? What about payment at the rate for the job, etc? </p> <p>However, to obtain a work placement seemed harder than getting a job. There was a three stage interview: first with the placement provider, next with the council liaison officer and finally with an officer from the relevant council department. Extraordinary! All for no proper job and salary! At the third interview, it was as I had suspected. The work consisted of simple tasks which others were too busy to do. Having ascertained that there would be no job at the end, nor would I have any advantage when applying for council posts, I couldn't honestly say that I was interested. I heard no more about it. </p> <p>At the job centre, my personal adviser disappeared for the next few months, and I was without one. I was officially on the intensive activity period, yet nothing had changed. </p> <p>Five weeks later, when summer faded into autumn, I made my way, somewhat unwillingly, to the offices of a voluntary organisation, where I had been told to attend an interview with the placement tutor to discuss a New Deal placement. I was to upgrade my computer skills in the upper floor computer room, where there were a dozen computers. </p> <p>A personal tutor from the college came to see me there and enrol me on a key skills course; he would visit me every few weeks for a meeting (tutorial?). He had an HND and told me he was doing a postgraduate course. I was given a questionnaire to complete. First, some statements to finish - my mental skills are... (OK) and so on. Then on to the yes/no questions. It was \"no\" to every one. For example: \"Do you need help with writing letters?\" </p> <p>I spent up to four half days a week at the voluntary organisation's offices, practising on a computer. The computer exercises began to pall after a while. </p> <p>With one exception, I could not credit any of those in authority with whom I came into contact on the New Deal with a great deal of intelligence. Most of the people were fairly pleasant; it was just that empathy was not a word with which they were familiar. Neither did they appear to have much knowledge or understanding of the labour market and the reasons why some of the unemployed find it hard to obtain work. </p> <p>Soon, my time spent at the voluntary organisation was down to two half days a week, and tea breaks expanded into longish reading breaks. </p> <p>The three \"tutorials\" on key skills were an amusing diversion, but rather a waste of time. And I never had a satisfactory explanation, or was able to define for myself, what key skills actually were. </p> <p>The 10 weeks there ended, as did the seven months at the programme centre - which, despite its peculiarities, I had grown to quite like and would miss the useful access to phones and newspapers and also the people who came and went. </p> <p>At the job centre just before Christmas I was allocated a new personal adviser for the next 13 weeks on the New Deal. The conversation was such as I had had more times than I cared to remember. </p> <p>\"Why can't you get the jobs you get shortlisted for?\" </p> <p>\"I don't get shortlisted for many.\" </p> <p>\"Do you contact the employer to ask why you weren't appointed?\" </p> <p>\"No, I would not be told the truth.\" And so on. </p> <p>Later, I started to think about the lottery of application forms, job interviews and obtaining work. Could next time be different? Maybe, just maybe. </p> <p>\u0095 Margaret Gray is a pseudonym</p>",

The computer exercises began to pall after a while. With one exception, I could not credit any of those in authority with whom I came into contact on the New Deal with a great deal of intelligence. Most of the people were fairly pleasant; it was just that empathy was not a word with which they were familiar. Neither did they appear to have much knowledge or understanding of the labour market and the reasons why some of the unemployed find it hard to obtain work. Soon, my time spent at the voluntary organisation was down to two half days a week, and tea breaks expanded into longish reading breaks. The three \"tutorials\" on key skills were an amusing diversion, but rather a waste of time. And I never had a satisfactory explanation, or was able to define for myself, what key skills actually were. The 10 weeks there ended, as did the seven months at the programme centre - which, despite its peculiarities, I had grown to quite like and would miss the useful access to phones and newspapers and also the people who came and went. At the job centre just before Christmas I was allocated a new personal adviser for the next 13 weeks on the New Deal. The conversation was such as I had had more times than I cared to remember. \"Why can't you get the jobs you get shortlisted for?\" \"I don't get shortlisted for many.\" \"Do you contact the employer to ask why you weren't appointed?\" \"No, I would not be told the truth.\" And so on. Later, I started to think about the lottery of application forms, job interviews and obtaining work. Could next time be different? Maybe, just maybe. \u0095 Margaret Gray is a pseudonym",

But this was just what I was able to do when I went back recently to interview former youngsters from the Southdown estate, Bath, where there were significant numbers of poor people. </p> <p>In 1976, I initiated the Southdown Community Project and was joined by Dave Wiles, a local young man with a record of delinquency. For five years it was based at my home, with clubs, parent and toddler groups and individual callers cramming in. Residents then raised money for a purpose-built building next to the public toilets. Dave and I swapped roles, with him becoming the leader. </p> <p>After 10 years, it was completely in the hands of the community and my family and I moved to Glasgow. </p> <p>Now I have been back to Southdown. Hundreds of kids went through the project and I made a list of 88 who had been close to it for several years. Of these, eight have died and some could not be traced. However, the third main leader, Jane Sellars, and I were able to interview 51. Nearly all of them had come from low-income parents with almost half raised by lone parents or step-parent families. In their early teens, when they were drawn into the project, 57% were experiencing difficulties at school, 39% were in trouble with the police and 22% were in homes visited by social workers. On a risk scale, 39% were rated as at high risk of future criminality, unemployment and unstable relationships. </p> <p>So how did they turn out? An assessment was made of them in their late teens and in adulthood. Between the ages of 16-19, a quarter of the youngsters were without any educational qualifications, nine had endured long periods of unemployment and seven had committed a series of offences. However, none had received a custodial sentence and only one girl had been taken into public care. </p> <p>By 1999, when most were in their early 30s, the outcomes were even more positive. Fourteen per cent had been convicted of mostly minor offences but none was in prison. None had a serious drugs problem. Nearly all were in two-parent situations with just 6% being lone parents. Most were in low-paid employment, although there were exceptions with three men and three women in management posts. Interestingly, 41% had participated in some form of youth work, usually as volunteers. Overall, 86% were deemed as being in satisfactory life situations - a pleasing finding considering that so many had started with childhood disadvantages. </p> <p>No doubt, many factors contributed to the favourable outcomes, including the qualities of the individuals themselves. But all 51 agreed that the Southdown Project had improved the quality of their childhoods, while a number were convinced it had steered them away from trouble. The following factors were identified as vital. </p> <p>First, the neighbourhood approach. The youth activities were open to any youngsters and were not restricted to delinquents. Consequently, attendance at the clubs did not stigmatise members. Further, youngsters who did have problems were influenced by peers who did not. </p> <p>Certainly, the clubs filled a gap. As one woman put it: \"We were hanging around on street corners. We didn't do anything else apart from the project. Without that, a lot more people would have gone off the rails.\" </p> <p>Second, a place of their own. An old lean-to on the side of our house became a den for 15 teenagers. As one former member said: \"It was the focal point for our group. It was where we met every night.\" They talked, larked around, strummed guitars and smoked. It was their place. They kept out of trouble without adults being present. </p> <p>Third, individual relationships. Through the clubs, the youngsters got to trust staff to whom they could turn when in need of help. Two-thirds of the 51 developed personal relationships with the three leaders over matters such as truancy, pregnancy, delinquency and difficulties with parents. One present manager of several shops had been frequently in trouble with the police and spent much of his time at our home. He said: \"Without the project I would almost certainly have got into more trouble. If I had been kicked out of school permanently what would have happened? What would have happened if I had been sent away?\" </p> <p>Fourth, the staff lived in the neighbourhood and so were always available. As one interviewee explained: \"The leaders were not simply people coming in and then going off, with nothing really happening. They were there 24 hours a day.\" Our presence meant that not only did we become known to youngsters but also to adults, many of whom became volunteers. </p> <p>Fifth, the staff were committed to staying a minimum of 10 years. We supported the schools, the pubs and the churches of the area and, over time, the project also became regarded as a part of the neighbourhood. Not least, the staff grew up with families. It was easier to relate with some disruptive teenagers when they had been known since they were small. </p> <p>The essence of the Southdown Project was a neighbourhood approach developed by staff who lived long term in the area.

      "body": "<p>In 1995, Barnardo's opened its original records to adults who had been in its care as children. The charity's files, going back to 1866, cover most of the 350,000 children cared for in its homes until the late 1970s. Inquirers had previously received information in the form of a written summary, but now original documents were available. In the same year, the BBC series Barnardo's Children brought the charity's change of heart to the public attention. </p> <p>Until the 1950s, most children left care with little or no knowledge of their family histories, growing up at a time when starting afresh with a \"clean slate\" was believed to be in their best interests. Now the charity was deluged with requests for information - 4,000 in the first few weeks alone. Despite doubling the social work team to tackle the demand, the backlog remained high until this year. </p> <p>Giving people information about their background is not a simple matter of handing over a file; it needs the assistance of a social worker. The records were never intended to be seen by their subjects, and the contents can be difficult to deal with. The language is sometimes harsh and judgmental and the details can be distressing or confusing. </p> <p>Many people have not had the chance to discuss their early childhood experiences, and they often need help to cope with a range of powerful emotions. People build up hopes, fears and fantasies about what their records may contain, and assim ilating new information about their past can cause pain, confusion, intense excitement or profound disappointment. </p> <p>In interviews with 12 adults a year after they had viewed their records, I found that, despite the frustrating wait for information, most people who had completed the process were able to appreciate with hindsight the need for social worker support, and had found the counselling on receiving their records helpful. </p> <p>The people I spoke to fell into three broad groups. First were those who belonged to \"real families\". They had been separated from their birth families at a very young age and had lived most of their childhood with one foster family, where they had a sense of belonging and being loved. As Mary, aged 58, put it: \"Mum used to say she chose us and she loved us and that's why she had us.\" </p> <p>At the other extreme were the \"rootless\" adults. They had been in Barnardo's care from a very young age but had lacked a settled family life, being moved about between residential and foster homes - and, in some cases, being abused or neglected. These adults had felt unloved as children, and their attempts to get information about their families and the reasons for being in care had been rebuffed. \"When you went into Barnardo's homes everything was censored and you didn't know anything and you weren't allowed to contact your relations at all,\" said Fred, aged 66. \"I just think at times they were cruel. The older you get the more angry you become.\" </p> <p>The third group, which I referred to as \"rescued\", had spent their early childhood with their birth families, but were removed to residential care following abuse or neglect. These adults seemed grateful to Barnardo's and compared their new lives favourably with what might have been. For them, Barnardo's became the substitute family, the alternative source of belonging and identity come into Barnardo's care after his father's death. He said: \"I felt protected in Barnardo's. We were growing up in a stronger world than a world dominated by a woman who really only wanted us out of the way.\" </p> <p>For the \"rootless\" adults, the impact of receiving new information had been almost overwhelming. Lifelong feelings of ignorance about who they were and feelings of stigma because of a lack of family meant that any new information about themselves had a magnified importance, and its impact could be dramatic. </p> <p>Alf, who discovered at the age of 70 that he had been born within marriage and that he had two brothers, felt huge elation: \"As soon as that was mentioned I was a different person. I feel as though something's been lifted off me. I'm just as good as anyone else - I've got a family!\". </p> <p>Neither Alf's wife nor children, let alone his friends, had known that he was a Barnardo's boy. Over the next year, he was able to adapt to a new identity that he could be proud of and open about socially. </p> <p>Among those from the \"real families\" group there appeared to be a reluctance to delve too far. They drew their sense of identity from their foster families and feared discovering something which might threaten this security. The new information had not changed their feelings about themselves. \"It didn't make me feel any different,\" said Mary. \"I think I had such a good upbringing from the start. Mum always told us, even though she wasn't our real mum, that she loved us, and that means a lot to a child.\" </p> <p> For some, such as Fred, the information was painful. He learned that his birth was the result of an incestuous relationship. \"It was a shock, but I'd rather I knew,\" he said. \"At least you don't have to wonder about it any more.\" </p> <p>Even those who already had some facts about their early lives could be taken by surprise as memories were unlocked and feelings from childhood re-ignited. Tom, who had entered Barnardo's at the age of 12, found tears running down his face: \"Suddenly all that information brought my dad back to life. All that old grief and pain welled up.\" </p> <p>Counselling helped Tom to deal with his emotions and lay the past to rest. Like many, he had been quite unprepared for the impact, particularly as he already had a reasonable awareness of his past. </p> <p>\"What came out of that was that I'd never actually let my dad go,\" he said. \"All those memories that came flooding back opened up a wound I thought I'd sealed forever. When I came for that Barnardo's information, it burst like a boil.\" </p> <p>A year after seeing their records, some people still felt angry about the opportunities they had been denied, but despite a mix of emotions most felt that the new information had made a positive contribution to their sense of self. All but one were glad to have seen their records. </p> <p>Since 1995, Barnardo's has assisted more than 5,000 people to view their records. The waiting list now numbers just under 700, and some 40 new inquiries are received each month. The charity estimates that around 60,000 of the children formerly in its care are still alive today, and may at any time decide to seek information on their past. </p> <p>Barnardo's no longer runs children's homes, but the lessons the charity has learned from helping the people once in its care are still relevant today. Young care leavers may benefit from more help in understanding the past before they can move on properly to adult life. Older adults too, who have spent some or all of their earlier lives in care, need ongoing support to make sense of the past. </p> <p>People responsible for children separated from their families should think carefully about the quality of records they keep, as certain kinds of information become the \"official\" version of an individual's history, while alternative information or viewpoints are left out.

It should still be tucked up under a pile of leaves. </p> <p>Pembrokeshire cousins of this frog produced frogspawn by January 21. On the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, frogspawn appeared last year before the shortest day, December 21. Pembrokeshire and Cornwall, warmed by the Gulf Stream, are traditionally the earliest places in Britain for this sort of thing. But early is getting earlier. </p> <p>Frogs, like many other species of wildlife, are responding to a general rising trend in temperature. The 1990s were the warmest decade since 1659, when records began. Spring was, on average, 1.3C warmer in the 1990s than the 1980s. This may not sound much, but when you consider that a 2C drop in temperature could plunge us into an ice age you can appreciate how this small increase is responsible for shifts in many spring events. </p> <p>Trees come into leaf at least six days earlier these days and autumn is happening four days later, according to a European survey conducted over the past 30 years. Insects emerge from hibernation earlier: the first small tortoiseshell butterfly this year was spotted on New Year's day and I saw a bat last week hunting for flies and moths. Birds begin their migrations earlier, but how on earth do swallows know it's warmer than usual in Aberystwyth when they set off from Africa? </p> <p>You don't have to be a David Attenborough to see that the weather is getting weirder. Phenology - recording the dates of events such as the first frogspawn, the first butterfly and the first swallow - is not just for wildlife anoraks. The government has recognised that biological events are significant indicators of climate change. Tim Sparks, of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, who has been advising on these indicators, says: \"We need all the closet phenologists to check their diaries. This sort of monitoring was popular with Victorians but it became a bit embarrassing. There is an accumulating body of evidence which shows that we are experiencing earlier springs, later autumns, warmer temperatures. These phenological events may convince people to take global warming more seriously.\" </p> <p>There is at least a month's difference, from the south to the north of the country, in the arrival of spring and this difference is being shunted forward a month or so. It's as if someone changed the calendar. I live in Shropshire, which is weeks behind the south-west, in a place which was a notorious frost-pocket. Today I saw daffodils flowering on Wenlock Edge. Time was, not so long ago, that you couldn't find a daffodil for St David's Day on March 1 unless you bought it from Channel Island imports in a shop. The birds here have been singing fit to burst, morning and evening, for weeks now. As far as they are concerned, this is spring. </p> <p>Whatever the birds are saying does not convince the boffins. The last days of January and the first days of February may be unseasonably warm, but, according to the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, it's only one degree higher than average. </p> <p>\"This is still winter,\" says Chris Folland, of the Hadley Centre. \"It may be of a warmer weather type influenced by the warm westerly winds of the north Atlantic oscilation, with fewer cold northerly and easterly winds, but this is not without precedent. The weather from 1895 to 1935 was similar. The climate models are not consistent and the jury is out on how much this current warming trend is due to global warming.\" </p> <p>Garden plants are blooming early, but it's the wild ones which are really surprising. Here in Shropshire, as in many parts of the country, hazel catkins are already golden and shaggy. My own country diary for 1996 doesn't mention fully flowering catkins until March 2. Snowdrops have been flowering for weeks. Primroses and a few dandelions are in bloom. I even had a foxglove in flower on Christmas Day. </p> <p>New wildflowers are arriving from the south. A group of spectacular orchids called Serapias, the tongue orchids from the Mediterranean, moved as far north as Brittany 20 years ago. In 1992, one was found in Cornwall, but suspicious botanists thought it must have been planted. In the past two years, others have turned up in Guernsey, Kent and Devon. And other Mediterranean species, whose seeds hitch a ride on ocean currents, like sea knot grass and sea daffodil, have begun to colonise the south coast. </p> <p>Botanist Peter Marren is convinced that there was no skul-duggery behind the arrival of the Serapias and, like other scientists, is excited about the prospect of new species arriving in Britain as a consequence of climate change. \"But it's not a simple warming,\" warns Marren, \"and it is potentially horrendous. We are moving into a violent climate - frequent storms and wetter springs. </p> <p>\"In some respects, violent winds may have ecological benefit to woodlands by increasing the naturalness of things which have been supressed by woodland management. But wet Mays and Junes have been disastrous for insects, and they are likely to be the first victims. When seasons are out of sync it affects plant flowering and this can cause an ecological megaproblem.\" </p> <p> The seasons certainly seem out of sync. But there are not too many people upset by unseasonally warm weather at this time of year. The sight of catkins, snowdrops and primroses are things which gladden the heart, so why not have them sooner rather than later? </p> <p>We say Britain doesn't have a climate, only weather, and we grumble about it: it's too cold, too hot, too wet, too dry. But whatever the weather, it is one of the principal ways that we feel nature around us. It shapes local and regional identity. It has seasonal rhythms which shaped our culture, even though we're far more insulated against it than we were. </p> <p>There is now an anxiety, even on a beautiful spring-like day, with the birds singing and flowers blooming, that there is something wrong. We have put the seasons out of whack and both nature and us will suffer for it. We need a cold spell to keep down the germs, greenfly and rats. We need the keenness of winter to really appreciate the joy of spring. </p> <p>But there's time yet. The weather could change - and officially it's still winter for at least another six weeks. </p> <p>\u0095 UK Wild 2000 is a series of wildlife surveys to be undertaken by children and will include tracking frogspawn from one end of the country to the other.

Two years ago, Daniel Jacoby, the Quebec ombudsman, recommended that each child should be offered a package of restorative measures - C$1,000 for every year they spent in an institution.

      "body": "<p>Among European film festivals, Rotterdam is special for all the distractions that it spares you. There's no PR frenzy, precious little Hollywood content and no stars. That's not to say there aren't names, but Rotterdam is so laid-back and democratic that they barely turn heads. A major figure such as Ice-T can drift in almost unnoticed, to sit on a low-key panel discussing the implications of low-budget cinema. \"The virus will infect film,\" he says, \"and I'm backing the virus.\" </p> <p>But at Rotterdam, film is the virus, proliferating in every direction until the festival programme weighs a ton. This year many delegates ditched everything else to go Japanese. The festival's tiger logo was eclipsed by variants on the Japanese flag - shimmering digital sun on the programme, big red balloons in the Hilton bar. The Corso, a cavernous 60s cinema, was transformed into the Japan Tech Pop Lounge, an all-day hangout offering cultural flaneurs a bath in state-of-the-art electro culture. </p> <p>Early in the week, many festival-goers declared they would simply soak up the retrospective of veteran director Kinji Fukasaku. Fukasaku, who has made nearly 60 films since 1961, specialises in yakuza (gangster) pics, and his work is considered highly revealing of the stresses in postwar Japanese society. Battles Without Honour or Humanity (1973), for example, recounts the history of a Hiroshima mob, beginning directly after the Bomb. </p> <p>A smart video distributor could make Fukasaku a cult among western connoisseurs of hard-men-in-suits movies (the brassy cod-Morricone scores would go down a storm). But the two yakuza films I saw, Battles Without Honour and Cops Vs Thugs, were much of a muchness. Both are relentlessly violent, both feature impenetrable plots, crowds of plug-uglies yelling at each other, and hard-nut icon Bunta Sugawara, a leathery, fag-chomping Kirk Douglas type. </p> <p>The Fukasaku pic that really set the juices flowing was an anomaly for the director: Black Lizard, a 1968 comic-book thriller that's pure Austin Powers. Its vampy arch- villainess, played by drag artist Akihiro Maruyama, does her nefarious stuff bedecked in froufrous, and hides out in a club decorated with Aubrey Beardsley murals. With its cameo by renowned novelist Yukio Mishima, Black Lizard was a cult favourite in the US in the 80s, and its time has surely come again. </p> <p>The more recent Japanese selection included Takeshi Kitano, Gamera the giant lizard and a mountain of cartoon epics. But the discovery that set the festival on its ears was director Takashi Miike. Rotterdam takes outrage in its stride (last year's star attraction was Catherine Breillat's meta-porn Romance), but even here, several punters hissed \"You're sick!\" at Miike as they left his screenings. </p> <p>There's no doubt Miike represents the new Japanese cinema at its speediest and nastiest. One of three new films, Dead or Alive starts off like thrash-metal yakuza and ends in nothing less than apocalypse. The inconsequential gang-war story kicks off with a head-spinning action montage of bikers, gay assassins, soup-guzzling mobsters and knife-throwing clowns, before things slow down enough to get queasy - there's even a visit to the shooting of an animal porn film. </p> <p>Audacious but empty, Dead or Alive is nothing compared with Miike's real jaw-dropper, the prize-winning Audition. This begins as a gentle tale about a middle-aged TV exec who searches for the girl of his dreams; unfortunately she proves to have a ghoulish past and a taste for amateur acupuncture. Audition proves Miike to be a master at manipulating audience expectations, mixing the tawdriness of Fatal Attaction with a flavour of Bu\u00f1uel and Polanski at their most ruthless. We'll be hearing a lot more about him. </p> <p>Some of the biggest pleasures, though, turned out to be gently old-fashioned. Rien \u00e0 Faire, by French director Marion Vernoux, is about a blue-collar woman and a male exec falling in love on the dole queue and in the supermarket. Dazzlingly shot and spiked with tender ironies, this brief encounter between romance and sociology confirms its star Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi as one of the current names to watch. </p> <p>The feeling this year was that there was less real satisfaction than the programme promised, but overall that didn't seem to matter too much. Among the Tiger winners, one created a buzz - Lou Ye's film Suzhou River, which some people labelled a Chinese version of Vertigo. And there was enough other material around to keep the arguments flying, which is really the point of this festival. Rotterdam stimulates the kind of see- anything, risk-anything community that few festivals attract these days. You may come back disappointed, but at least you get to be disappointed by a challenging, eclectic selection that you wouldn't see gathered together anywhere else.</p>",

Battles Without Honour or Humanity (1973), for example, recounts the history of a Hiroshima mob, beginning directly after the Bomb. A smart video distributor could make Fukasaku a cult among western connoisseurs of hard-men-in-suits movies (the brassy cod-Morricone scores would go down a storm). But the two yakuza films I saw, Battles Without Honour and Cops Vs Thugs, were much of a muchness. Both are relentlessly violent, both feature impenetrable plots, crowds of plug-uglies yelling at each other, and hard-nut icon Bunta Sugawara, a leathery, fag-chomping Kirk Douglas type. The Fukasaku pic that really set the juices flowing was an anomaly for the director: Black Lizard, a 1968 comic-book thriller that's pure Austin Powers. Its vampy arch- villainess, played by drag artist Akihiro Maruyama, does her nefarious stuff bedecked in froufrous, and hides out in a club decorated with Aubrey Beardsley murals. With its cameo by renowned novelist Yukio Mishima, Black Lizard was a cult favourite in the US in the 80s, and its time has surely come again. The more recent Japanese selection included Takeshi Kitano, Gamera the giant lizard and a mountain of cartoon epics. But the discovery that set the festival on its ears was director Takashi Miike. Rotterdam takes outrage in its stride (last year's star attraction was Catherine Breillat's meta-porn Romance), but even here, several punters hissed \"You're sick!\" at Miike as they left his screenings. There's no doubt Miike represents the new Japanese cinema at its speediest and nastiest. One of three new films, Dead or Alive starts off like thrash-metal yakuza and ends in nothing less than apocalypse. The inconsequential gang-war story kicks off with a head-spinning action montage of bikers, gay assassins, soup-guzzling mobsters and knife-throwing clowns, before things slow down enough to get queasy - there's even a visit to the shooting of an animal porn film. Audacious but empty, Dead or Alive is nothing compared with Miike's real jaw-dropper, the prize-winning Audition. This begins as a gentle tale about a middle-aged TV exec who searches for the girl of his dreams; unfortunately she proves to have a ghoulish past and a taste for amateur acupuncture. Audition proves Miike to be a master at manipulating audience expectations, mixing the tawdriness of Fatal Attaction with a flavour of Bu\u00f1uel and Polanski at their most ruthless. We'll be hearing a lot more about him. Some of the biggest pleasures, though, turned out to be gently old-fashioned. Rien \u00e0 Faire, by French director Marion Vernoux, is about a blue-collar woman and a male exec falling in love on the dole queue and in the supermarket. Dazzlingly shot and spiked with tender ironies, this brief encounter between romance and sociology confirms its star Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi as one of the current names to watch. The feeling this year was that there was less real satisfaction than the programme promised, but overall that didn't seem to matter too much. Among the Tiger winners, one created a buzz - Lou Ye's film Suzhou River, which some people labelled a Chinese version of Vertigo. And there was enough other material around to keep the arguments flying, which is really the point of this festival. Rotterdam stimulates the kind of see- anything, risk-anything community that few festivals attract these days. You may come back disappointed, but at least you get to be disappointed by a challenging, eclectic selection that you wouldn't see gathered together anywhere else.",

That treat falls instead to <strong>Matt Schofield</strong> for his \"Cowboy horse dance\" celebration. And it goes a little something like this. \"Shearer starts the routine by pretending to saddle up then clamber aboard the beaten, prostrate keeper.

To make this a perfect celebration, he would of course, have to dismount at some point to allow play to resume, at which time he would offer a simple, humble prayer.\"</p> <p>But, as Matt observes, that's not all. \"It would, of course, be necessary, having created an imaginary pony, to then properly care for it during the rest of the match. This would create numerous, humorous breaks in the routine of the game during which he could leave the pitch, pretending to offer hay or an apple to the beast.\" Hurrah!

      "body": "<p>What is wrong with this government, and with its predecessors, is that it operates on a case by case basis. It has no feeling for the principles of liberty and, clearly, it has no time for them.</p> <p>For example, the Lords won us a temporary remission by defeating the attempt to restrict trial by jury, but no one should suppose this is more than a temporary respite. Jack Straw and his government will be back.</p> <p>The principles which preserve between them the rule of law and the rights of individuals have been systematically subverted by recent governments. This government has been the most recent to attack them it has been the most determined. In every case it has cited what seem plausible, even worthwhile, reasons for its actions, but the cumulative effect has been to erode the rules which protect us. Indeed, it is almost as if the government has made out a checklist of those rules, determined to strike them down one by one.</p> <p>Presumption of innocence was weakened to catch serious fraud cases. After all, we do not want crooked high flyers to get away with their clever and complicated schemes. The upshot is that they may now be required to show that they acted legitimately, rather than having the state prove that they broke the law.</p> <p>Double jeopardy meant that you could not be put on trial again once you had been acquitted: not any more. It first went out when we allowed civil prosecutions after criminal ones had failed. We do not like to see people walk free when we disagree with the jury, so we allow a second shot. This is why O J Simpson was put on trial again on the same evidence which had seen him acquitted. In a civil trial it is easier, too, because a balance of evidence is sufficient, rather than \"beyond any reasonable doubt\".</p> <p>Now new criminal prosecutions are being considered when new evidence emerges. This is partly an aftermath of the Lawrence murder, and the laudable desire not to let racist thugs get away with it.</p> <p>Limited jurisdiction meant that you had to do something which was a crime in the place which put you on trial. This one went when Lady Thatcher forced a war crimes bill through despite determined opposition in the Lords. It has since been further weakened. We can now try people for things they do abroad which would be offences in Britain, but which are perhaps less well enforced over there. We can even try them for things which were not offences at the time. As always, we are told that this is the only way to get at certain classes of criminals. After all, who cares what happens to suspected paedophiles and war criminals?</p> <p>The right of silence allowed no presumption to be drawn from the refusal of an accused to say anything. No one could be forced to testify in their defence. It used to help prevent beatings or torture of suspects. If they need not say anything at all, there was less reason to force them to say suitably incriminating things. Now judges may tell juries to draw inferences when an accused exercises this right, and another right is diluted.</p> <p>Habeas corpus prevented the state from holding people incommunicado while it dealt with them. It had to produce them in open court and charge them. This was all very well, but for suspected terrorists various extensions were allowed because the authorities needed more time. Imprisonment without trial in the form of internment was even permitted under the general heading of prevention of terrorism. Again the defence is that it only concerns terrorists.</p> <p>Conviction before sentence was a corner-stone principle. You had to convict someone before you could punish them. This is no longer true in the case of suspected drug dealers. Their property can be confiscated if it is suspected to have derived from drug profits, even if this cannot be proved. The alternative would have been to let these sleazy merchants of death and misery laugh at justice and walk off with their gains.</p> <p>Prior restraint was notoriously difficult to obtain in Britain. People broke the law, and they were caught, tried and punished. It was the way the law worked. Now the government is reported to be considering a scheme under which satellites control the speed of cars to prevent them from exceeding the speed limit by cutting their fuel supply. The imagination leaps to supply what similar things might be done once the principle is breached.</p> <p>Trial by jury is threatened because crooks are thought more likely to hoodwink juries than magistrates. The notion of facing your peers in open court is all very well, but not if it allows you to get away with it. The Lords saved it once, but no one supposes that the threat will go away.</p> <p>The pattern emerges quite clearly: government is making laws out of particular cases and eroding the general principles in order to secure a particular aim. It wants to bring to justice the people none of us have any time for: financial swindlers, racist thugs, paedophiles, war criminals, drug dealers and terrorists. Others might include rapists, petty professional criminals who are \"obviously guilty'', and multiple offenders whose record will be known to magistrates, but not to juries.</p> <p>In the interest of bringing these low lifes to justice, the principles which protect the liberties of all of us are swept away. The precepts which have guarded society are destroyed to target particular groups of offenders. After all, we do not want them getting off, do we? In some cases, though, we might accept that, preferring a few unsavoury individuals to walk free rather than compromise the foundations on which our liberties depend. We give the devil himself the benefit of our laws, for how could we otherwise claim it ourselves?</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Madsen Pirie is president of the Adam Smith Institute</p>",

For example, the Lords won us a temporary remission by defeating the attempt to restrict trial by jury, but no one should suppose this is more than a temporary respite. Jack Straw and his government will be back. The principles which preserve between them the rule of law and the rights of individuals have been systematically subverted by recent governments. This government has been the most recent to attack them it has been the most determined. In every case it has cited what seem plausible, even worthwhile, reasons for its actions, but the cumulative effect has been to erode the rules which protect us. Indeed, it is almost as if the government has made out a checklist of those rules, determined to strike them down one by one. Presumption of innocence was weakened to catch serious fraud cases. After all, we do not want crooked high flyers to get away with their clever and complicated schemes. The upshot is that they may now be required to show that they acted legitimately, rather than having the state prove that they broke the law. Double jeopardy meant that you could not be put on trial again once you had been acquitted: not any more. It first went out when we allowed civil prosecutions after criminal ones had failed. We do not like to see people walk free when we disagree with the jury, so we allow a second shot. This is why O J Simpson was put on trial again on the same evidence which had seen him acquitted. In a civil trial it is easier, too, because a balance of evidence is sufficient, rather than \"beyond any reasonable doubt\". Now new criminal prosecutions are being considered when new evidence emerges. This is partly an aftermath of the Lawrence murder, and the laudable desire not to let racist thugs get away with it. Limited jurisdiction meant that you had to do something which was a crime in the place which put you on trial. This one went when Lady Thatcher forced a war crimes bill through despite determined opposition in the Lords. It has since been further weakened. We can now try people for things they do abroad which would be offences in Britain, but which are perhaps less well enforced over there. We can even try them for things which were not offences at the time. As always, we are told that this is the only way to get at certain classes of criminals. After all, who cares what happens to suspected paedophiles and war criminals? The right of silence allowed no presumption to be drawn from the refusal of an accused to say anything. No one could be forced to testify in their defence. It used to help prevent beatings or torture of suspects. If they need not say anything at all, there was less reason to force them to say suitably incriminating things. Now judges may tell juries to draw inferences when an accused exercises this right, and another right is diluted. Habeas corpus prevented the state from holding people incommunicado while it dealt with them. It had to produce them in open court and charge them. This was all very well, but for suspected terrorists various extensions were allowed because the authorities needed more time. Imprisonment without trial in the form of internment was even permitted under the general heading of prevention of terrorism. Again the defence is that it only concerns terrorists. Conviction before sentence was a corner-stone principle. You had to convict someone before you could punish them. This is no longer true in the case of suspected drug dealers. Their property can be confiscated if it is suspected to have derived from drug profits, even if this cannot be proved. The alternative would have been to let these sleazy merchants of death and misery laugh at justice and walk off with their gains. Prior restraint was notoriously difficult to obtain in Britain. People broke the law, and they were caught, tried and punished. It was the way the law worked. Now the government is reported to be considering a scheme under which satellites control the speed of cars to prevent them from exceeding the speed limit by cutting their fuel supply. The imagination leaps to supply what similar things might be done once the principle is breached. Trial by jury is threatened because crooks are thought more likely to hoodwink juries than magistrates. The notion of facing your peers in open court is all very well, but not if it allows you to get away with it. The Lords saved it once, but no one supposes that the threat will go away. The pattern emerges quite clearly: government is making laws out of particular cases and eroding the general principles in order to secure a particular aim. It wants to bring to justice the people none of us have any time for: financial swindlers, racist thugs, paedophiles, war criminals, drug dealers and terrorists. Others might include rapists, petty professional criminals who are \"obviously guilty'', and multiple offenders whose record will be known to magistrates, but not to juries. In the interest of bringing these low lifes to justice, the principles which protect the liberties of all of us are swept away. The precepts which have guarded society are destroyed to target particular groups of offenders. After all, we do not want them getting off, do we? In some cases, though, we might accept that, preferring a few unsavoury individuals to walk free rather than compromise the foundations on which our liberties depend. We give the devil himself the benefit of our laws, for how could we otherwise claim it ourselves? \u0095 Dr Madsen Pirie is president of the Adam Smith Institute",

It is the hands of others who grow the food we eat, sew the clothes we wear, and build the homes we inhabit.</p> <p>It is the hands of others who tend us when we are sick, and who raise us up when we fall. And it is the hands of others who lift us first from the cradle and lower us finally into the grave.</p> <p>And it is because we live not in markets or in governments, but live in families and in neighbourhoods and social networks - because we live in a world of connections, loyalties and friendships - that we should encourage not only respect for others as individuals, but involvement with them in cooperation and mutual support as neighbours helping neighbours - what someone called the countless acts of friendship, kindness and courage that I believe are all the greater because they are carried out without hope of any reward</p> <p>Our society is rich in such acts of kindness and can become richer because there are millions of people - people like you and people in organisations like yours - millions of people who believe in something bigger than themselves, and in causes greater than the maximisation of self-interest.</p> <p>And our society is so enriched not just because of our interdependence, but because of shared values that have developed and strengthened over time.</p> <p>Jonathan Sacks had made the distinction between two kinds of political and social settlement. One is a contract, the other is a covenant. The first is a set of political institutions that nations establish out of nothing grander than mutual self interest. But I believe that Britain has developed from contract to covenant - because it is a society based on common values that have taken root through a shared history.</p> <p>And these values which we share include a commitment to fair play, tolerance, decency and reciprocity in our relationships with each other.</p> <p>I was brought up in Kirkcaldy - the home of Adam Smith who described in his Wealth of Nations the economic benefits of markets - \"the invisible hand\"- but the same Adam Smith in his theory of moral sentiments extolled the virtues of co-operation and altruism - that is the helping hand.</p> <p>And growing up as I did in a town with strong community and voluntary organisations at its heart I saw how individuals were encouraged and strengthened, made to feel they belonged and, in turn, contributed as part of an intricate network of trust, recognition and obligation, encompassing family friends, school, church, local associations, and voluntary organisations.</p> <p>So at the centre of my vision of society is a simple truth.

But I want that foundation to be the same that charities themselves want - a base of support from givers.</p> <p>For too long the voluntary sector has been held back by archaic rules, bad laws, poor tax legislation.</p> <p>The Government agrees it needs a fair and sympathetic legal and economic framework and one in which financial or tax reliefs are more directly dependent on the extent to which it can deliver social benefit.</p> <p>So first, to back local initiatives by exploiting the new tax regime, we are planning to boost charitable giving by individuals.</p> <p>Our aim: millions more giving so that by the end of the year 2002 we, as a people, are giving a billion more.</p> <p>To achieve this aim, let me list the reforms we are ready to make.</p> <p>For direct cash donations to charities, we will give tax relief all round - for all donations, large or small, regular or one off.</p> <p>So for every pound a British citizen donates to charity, the Government will contribute to that charity an additional 28 pence.</p> <p>And we are making it even more advantageous to use payroll giving.</p> <p>First, we are abolishing the ceiling on how much money employees can give through the pay packet - so payroll giving can now be any sum an employee chooses.</p> <p>And second, for the next three years, we are offering a special 10 per cent supplement on all payroll donations to charities.</p> <p>So for every pound contributed through payroll-giving, the Government will contribute up to 50 pence worth of tax relief.</p> <p>And we are ready to go further to help encourage the donations charities need.</p> <p>There will now be a new income tax relief not just for cash donations to charities, but for gifts of quoted shares.</p> <p>This means that people and companies can donate their shares to charity, without having to pay any capital gains tax, and get extra tax relief for the full value of the shares. In other words, if a person gives \u00a31000 worth of shares, an extra \u00a31000 of their income will not be assessed for tax.</p> <p>These are major financial reforms designed to simplify and to multiply giving in our country.</p> <p>And the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) has estimated that our reforms could provide an extra 350 million pounds a year for charities.</p> <p>Incentives to encourage individual giving are the start of the new financial foundation for charities.</p> <p>But we want Britain also to start a new chapter in corporate giving.</p> <p>At present in the USA around 1 per cent of company profits are given to charity.</p> <p>But in Britain it is only 0.2 per cent of company profits</p> <p>It is time for a new start here too.</p> <p>I want to encourage more local companies to be active in civic life in their areas and I want to see more of our international companies becoming giving companies too.</p> <p>So we propose a new tax regime for companies to give more - so that they become companies not just working in the community but working for the community</p> <p>In the last two years, we have made it possible for companies to set against tax gifts of computers and equipment to charities and to schools.</p> <p>From April we are introducing a major innovation.</p> <p>Like individuals, companies can give any amount to charity - no matter how large or small - and get tax relief for the full amount.</p> <p>But in the past, any charitable giving required companies to deduct tax from the gift - and the charities had to claim this back.</p> <p>From April, free of red tape, companies can now give the full amount to charity - no tax to deduct from the gift, no paperwork, no bureaucracy. It has never been simpler. Because we want to make this, the first decade of the new millennium, a decade of giving, we will take special measures as a government to inform, advise on and publicise the new financial measures.</p> <p>To make our new scheme easily understood and easy for companies and individuals to introduce and easy for charities to apply, we are setting up a new telephone help-line. Charities will only need to ring one number to get the advice they need.</p> <p>To make advice simple and readily available in one place we will publish a new directory for charities and new tax guidance.</p> <p>But we want to promote the giving of time as well as money</p> <p>When the active community working group published its report it suggested that:</p> <p>\u00ad by 2005 two-thirds of adults should be able to undertake at least two hours voluntary activity a week;</p> <p>\u00ad by 2003 all secondary school pupils should understand how they can participate in community based activities;</p> <p>\u00ad by 2002 local authority fora to be established to engage employers in community activity programmes.</p> <p>So, in addition to new financial foundations for charities and voluntary action, we need to do much more to create a culture of giving time.</p> <p>Our next task is to encourage new volunteers, create new volunteering opportunities, and to build networks that match those who can give help to those which need help.</p> <p>So how can this be achieved.</p> <p>We are already working with charities and the voluntary sector on key initiatives:</p> <p>\u00ad first, setting up an Internet-based database - \"The Site\" - providing individuals with free and direct access to volunteering opportunities throughout Britain - 24 hours a day, 365 days a year;</p> <p>\u00ad second, supporting the campaign being launched by one-20 and the BBC at the end of the month to celebrate volunteering and inspire people to give time;</p> <p>\u00ad third, funding the development of the first ever community-based digital tv channel - The Media Trust's Community Channel;</p> <p>\u00ad fourth, establishing new regional networks, which will link the voluntary organisations in each region to the new regional development agencies;</p> <p>\u00ad fifth, running active community demonstration projects in five areas, testing ways of strengthening community activity and creating new volunteering opportunities.</p> <p>To advance both the giving of money and time, we will bring together all relevant parties - the voluntary sector, key Government departments, business leaders, employees' representatives, and marketing, advertising, media experts - to examine proposals for a national campaign based on a partnership with the voluntary sector.</p> <p><b>Civic engagement</b> Encouragement to give time and money is one thing. The question to ask myself as I conclude, is how we can work together to do more to advance and highlight the need for civic renewal and the uniqueness of Britain as the home of civic society - how therefore we can extend civic activism and engagement and thus build a new civic strength.</p> <p>I have elsewhere talked about a new kind of Britain, one of growing civic strength where, by defending the individual against the abuse of power and seeking ourselves as citizens of the state and not its subjects, a new sense of community develops. And I have written of a new Britain where there is genuine devolution of power, not centralisation and respect for localism and self governing communities.</p> <p>Indeed, in future people will not wait for Whitehall to solve our problems. Instead of people looking upwards to Whitehall for their solutions, from region to region, locality to locality, more and more people will themselves be in charge of the decisions that affect their lives.</p> <p>But this new Britain of growing civic strength will also be a Britain which evolves that richer and stronger relationship between individual, community and state - the individual empowered in a supportive community.</p> <p>And so the British way - to champion civic life and enhance local initiative and local responsibility - means we should do far more to support voluntary charitable and community action - and empower the forces of compassion and care in our communities that are at the heart of a successful society.</p> <p>Let me give two examples of the new relationship between individuals, communities, and state - and the new role for voluntary work that follows.</p> <p>Sure Start brings a principle into action for the first time for many years - that services for the under-fives not only involve private, voluntary and charitable activities, but can be run through and by them.</p> <p>Sure Start, allowing partnerships to be responsible not only for a defined service but for all services for an area.</p> <p>All the latest evidence is that the first three years are critical to a child's brain development and can have a lifelong impact on a child's intellectual and emotional well being.</p> <p>So we must do more to counteract disadvantages that arise from poverty and lack of support at birth and beyond.</p> <p>Sure Start was allocated 450 million pounds for the next three years. 250 local programmes will be established by 2001. And we are tackling the cause for poverty - lack of educational opportunity, lack of parental support, lack of health advice. What opportunity is there for young children if they are left hobbled/crippled and 100 yards behind in the race of life.</p> <p>We do not want winners and losers, but winners and winners as we broaden the circle of opportunity to include everyone.</p> <p>5-7 per cent of the child population will benefit directly from Sure Start.</p> <p>Sixty trailblazer areas have been selected and 47 are now up and running.</p> <p>They are based on real communities. Some cover just 85 children, others 4,000, the average 500-800. So this is work in a small area to help those most in need.</p> <p>And we are proposing to spend on average 3,000 pounds more per child per year.</p> <p>But let us be clear about the radicalism of the new principle.</p> <p>Sure Start allows the voluntary sector to be responsible and in charge, not only of a defined service, but all services for under fours in an area.</p> <p>Instead of the state - local or national - running these programmes, these can be run by volunteers, charities, community organisations.</p> <p>Indeed, we should be prepared to pass over the responsibility for services in these geographical areas to the voluntary partnership.</p> <p>And by learning from what works and from each other, spread the best good practice as we extend the project.</p> <p>The proposed New Children's Fund extends this principle.</p> <p>It offers Government money to back non-Government initiatives to tackle child poverty.</p> <p>Again it is a partnership in which the voluntary community and charitable organisations take the lead, using their initiative local knowledge and skill to put their ideas and projects to work.</p> <p>So the new relationship between individual community and Government involves real devolution of power from Government - local and national - to self-governing communities.</p> <p>And as it moves into the next phase, as I will announce in the Budget, the New Deal will seek to work even more closely with voluntary organisations as we both increase the opportunities for the hard to employ young unemployed and adults - with not just training but advice coaching and encouragement.</p> <p>But these are not all the new initiatives where we want to encourage your ideas, your energies, your action, and will support it.</p> <p>We are happy to work with you in developing new ideas.</p> <p>In for example education where I can see how we can do more to extend the helping hand to school children - a new enhanced local network of mentors for children to help them read. Perhaps 100,000 mentors in all parts of the country.</p> <p>In improving the environment, where to avoid what some call the threat of a drawbridge Britain-of walled private communities hidden from each other - we need to look at the better use of public space.</p> <p>In communications, new and better community uses for local tv, radio, media and the Internet.</p> <p>In the classroom better civic education courses and from school more opportunities for young people to do voluntary work.</p> <p>In business extending into a national network the use of mentors that will encourage local small businesses.</p> <p>In the Internet, new computer learning centres engaging public, private and voluntary sectors at the hub of the community.</p> <p>In service overseas, a new boost to working in the developing world.</p> <p>And voluntary action extends to community economic regeneration.</p> <p>In the Pre-Budget Report I announced the 30 million pound Phoenix Fund, part of which will promote community finance initiatives. These provide finance for projects where there are high social returns. So this aims to promote the type of organisations that we have been talking about today. We aim to have this element of the Phoenix Fund up and running in the Spring. So soon local communities will be directly benefiting.</p> <p>We want to do more. So I can announce today the setting up of a Social Investment Task Force. I want to see more investment in the UK in social enterprises - projects which have social objectives, and are not simply profit orientated. This Task Force will look into how this can be achieved, looking at:</p> <p>\u00ad the case for social investment and a social investment fund;</p> <p>\u00ad identify barriers to the further development of this field; and</p> <p>\u00ad propose solutions and models for the future development of social investment.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>So let me conclude</p> <p>Far from being eclipsed by the consumer economy and global markets, care and compassion are with us still and poised to flourish.</p> <p>Indeed together in the new century we will realise a new greatness in Britain not in high politics but in the millions of quiet often uncelebrated deeds and acts of kindness courage and humanity of people all over our country Let us work for a future where Britain's goodness and its greatness are as one</p> <p>Your efforts, initiative and pioneering work -the work of voluntary organisations you represent and advance- are at the heart of Britain's civic renewal and represent the better Britain we want to build in the twenty first century.</p> <p>So let us resolve to use the millennium to realise and celebrate our enduring values.</p> <p>Let us build a new civic patriotism together.</p> <p>Let us have confidence that together we can build a great British society.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So I think of Britain not just as a marketplace where people are in competition with each other, but as a community of citizens with common needs, mutual interests, shared objectives, related goals, and most of all, linked destinies; a Britain not of strangers who merely compete with each other, but a Britain of neighbours who recognise each other and recognise we depend upon each other. As the American James Stockinger wrote, society depends on the hands of others. It is the hands of others who grow the food we eat, sew the clothes we wear, and build the homes we inhabit. It is the hands of others who tend us when we are sick, and who raise us up when we fall. And it is the hands of others who lift us first from the cradle and lower us finally into the grave. And it is because we live not in markets or in governments, but live in families and in neighbourhoods and social networks - because we live in a world of connections, loyalties and friendships - that we should encourage not only respect for others as individuals, but involvement with them in cooperation and mutual support as neighbours helping neighbours - what someone called the countless acts of friendship, kindness and courage that I believe are all the greater because they are carried out without hope of any reward Our society is rich in such acts of kindness and can become richer because there are millions of people - people like you and people in organisations like yours - millions of people who believe in something bigger than themselves, and in causes greater than the maximisation of self-interest. And our society is so enriched not just because of our interdependence, but because of shared values that have developed and strengthened over time. Jonathan Sacks had made the distinction between two kinds of political and social settlement. One is a contract, the other is a covenant. The first is a set of political institutions that nations establish out of nothing grander than mutual self interest. But I believe that Britain has developed from contract to covenant - because it is a society based on common values that have taken root through a shared history. And these values which we share include a commitment to fair play, tolerance, decency and reciprocity in our relationships with each other. I was brought up in Kirkcaldy - the home of Adam Smith who described in his Wealth of Nations the economic benefits of markets - \"the invisible hand\"- but the same Adam Smith in his theory of moral sentiments extolled the virtues of co-operation and altruism - that is the helping hand. And growing up as I did in a town with strong community and voluntary organisations at its heart I saw how individuals were encouraged and strengthened, made to feel they belonged and, in turn, contributed as part of an intricate network of trust, recognition and obligation, encompassing family friends, school, church, local associations, and voluntary organisations. So at the centre of my vision of society is a simple truth. Not the individual glorying in isolation, sufficient unto himself, stranded or striving on his own, but of the individual literally at home in society, and feeling at home because he is part not only of a family, but of a neighbourhood, a community and a social network. And in this vision of society there is a sense of belonging that expands outwards as we grow - from family, out to friends and neighbourhood - play groups and after school groups, children's and youth organisations, trade unions, sports, community, voluntary organisations - a sense of belonging that then ripples outwards again from work, school church and local community - and eventually outwards to far beyond our home town and region - to define our nation, our state and our country as a society. This is my idea of Britain - because there is such a thing as society - a community of communities. Tens of thousands of local neighbourhood civic associations, unions, charity and voluntary organisations, each one unique and every one special. A Britain energised by a million centres of action and compassion, of concern and initiative that together embody a very British idea - that of civic society. There is a strong case for saying that in the age of enlightenment ,Britain invented the modern idea of civic society-rooted in what the Scottish philosopher Adam Fergusson called our 'civil responsibilities', eventually incorporating what Edmund Burke defined as little platoons: two ideas we would today recognise as being at the heart not only of the voluntary sector but of a strong society. Call it community, call it civic patriotism call it the giving age, or call it the new active citizenship, call it the great British society - it is Britain becoming Britain again. And my vision is of communities, old and new, acknowledging each others strengths and contributions. Communities no longer inward-looking and exclusive, but looking outwards, recognising that when the strong help the weak we are all stronger. So this is a different Britain. Initiative, responsibility and power kept close to the people. Government doing what it needs to do but only what it needs to do and doing it better. The state in Neil Kinnock's words: \"Not above our heads but below our feet.\" National leadership, not seeking centre stage, but creating space for the neighbourliness and the civic spirit and voluntary energies of millions of people to light up our country. Government less directing and controlling than enabling and empowering. We politicians no longer looking for the opportunity to expand government but government looking always to expand opportunity. All this is humbling for government because it forces government to recognise its limitations and your strengths. But that is why there is a new interest in the voluntary sector and the role of voluntary organisations - and why the relationship between individual, state and community is best seen more as a covenant of shared values than as a contract. The civic society we believe will work best in the new century draws on the strengths of co-operation and altruism and self fulfilment as well as self interest. This is not an attempt to recreate an old world we have lost, but rather to look forward to a new world that together we are creating. So here the civic society we talk about is not a rejection of modernity but its practical fulfilment, to the advantage of all of us. So voluntary action has a central role to play. This is voluntary action not doing things for people - and creating a dependency inducing relationship - but doing things with people, working for the common good. People - over the life cycle from the cradle to the grave - helped in childhood, helping in youth and adulthood, helping again - and helped in old age - reciprocity across the generations - making a reality of Burke's definition of society as \"a partnership extended over time\". Now we know the limits of charity - that what is begged can also be refused, that what is given can be withheld, that what is granted can be taken away. But we know too the real strengths of voluntary action, doing things at a local level that the state - sometimes remote, often inflexible - cannot. The first great strength of voluntary action is that it is local rather than remote , close to home rather than impersonal, involving volunteers who are not only more able to see a problem that can be solved and take action to solve it, but can do so with advantage, because local action minimises the space between the problem and the answer. Put it this way - once we thought the man in Whitehall knew best - that was a long time ago - now we know the woman from the WRVS - or the playgroup movement - might know better. The second real strength of voluntary action is its ability to innovate where often the state is inflexible. Some say of the rules governing the public sector - if it isn't explicitly permitted, it is illegal. But for the voluntary sector there is greater flexibility - that what is not prevented is permitted. So new initiatives can flourish. You can more easily innovate. You can lead governments to new ways of thinking about problems and indeed new ways of solving them. And from your new ideas of yesterday has come today's established way of doing things. And let me give just two examples. At home, the voluntary sector has transformed the way we think about the care of the dying. Abroad, the voluntary sector has revolutionised the way the developed world now works alongside the developing world. And both these strengths underlines the third great strength of voluntary action: - its capacity for the individual rather than impersonal approach; - the greater emphasis you place on the one to one, face to face, person to person approach, on being at the front line, often with the most needy and most vulnerable in our society; where the approach must above all be unique rather than uniform. As has so often been said, you do not rebuild communities from the top down. You can only rebuild one family, one street, one neighbourhood at a time. Or as spiritual leaders sometimes say - one soul at a time. As one Jewish saying puts it: \"if you have saved one life, you are saving the world\". The fourth great strength of voluntary action is that by participating in our community, we learn about the world beyond our front doors and garden gates, and our citizenship is stronger as a result. Citizenship is, as someone said, \"the quality of our response to membership of a community\", not just the obligations we accept because of our dependence upon each other but the duty to actively participate in making our society better. And voluntary action trains us in and strengthens our citizenship because people are engaged at the heart of their community, making their contribution not just through their taxes but through their time, not just through four yearly voting but through the act of volunteering, citizenship becoming, as a result, not passive membership but active engagement. So let me summarise. In the past, voluntary organisations have been caught in the middle of an unnecessary political fight. Parts of the left saw the voluntary sector as a threat to the things government should be doing. Old Labour accused of seeking to substitute state for charitable action. The Right, for its part, used the voluntary sector to relieve Government of Government's proper responsibilities. The new Right seeking to substitute charitable action for the state. So both old Labour and the new Right got it wrong. We have learnt from the mistakes of the past. Democratically elected government does have a responsibility to ensure the public interest is advanced, to ensure basic rights are upheld for everyone, to guarantee that where people vote democratically that a service must be provided. But government must recognise that it does not have the solution to every problem, that it must work with the grain of people, and that the advancement of the public interest does not always require public control. The New Deal between voluntary organisations and government that we started to construct with our compact is a partnership that can no longer be caricatured as the state directing and charities responding, nor is it based on the state walking away - and charities left to plug the gaps, or vice versa. The way forward is not, either, a constant war of attrition to decide the proper demarcation between charities and government as if the success of government meant less charity and the success of charity meant less government. The way forward is government and charities, working in partnership based on mutual respect, a recognition that the voluntary sector is not a cut-price alternative to statutory provision, nor a way of ducking the responsibilities of families, including the extended family or society. New financial foundation for charities To help in this, I first want to put charities on a firm foundation for the future. But I want that foundation to be the same that charities themselves want - a base of support from givers. For too long the voluntary sector has been held back by archaic rules, bad laws, poor tax legislation. The Government agrees it needs a fair and sympathetic legal and economic framework and one in which financial or tax reliefs are more directly dependent on the extent to which it can deliver social benefit. So first, to back local initiatives by exploiting the new tax regime, we are planning to boost charitable giving by individuals. Our aim: millions more giving so that by the end of the year 2002 we, as a people, are giving a billion more. To achieve this aim, let me list the reforms we are ready to make. For direct cash donations to charities, we will give tax relief all round - for all donations, large or small, regular or one off. So for every pound a British citizen donates to charity, the Government will contribute to that charity an additional 28 pence. And we are making it even more advantageous to use payroll giving. First, we are abolishing the ceiling on how much money employees can give through the pay packet - so payroll giving can now be any sum an employee chooses. And second, for the next three years, we are offering a special 10 per cent supplement on all payroll donations to charities. So for every pound contributed through payroll-giving, the Government will contribute up to 50 pence worth of tax relief. And we are ready to go further to help encourage the donations charities need. There will now be a new income tax relief not just for cash donations to charities, but for gifts of quoted shares. This means that people and companies can donate their shares to charity, without having to pay any capital gains tax, and get extra tax relief for the full value of the shares. In other words, if a person gives \u00a31000 worth of shares, an extra \u00a31000 of their income will not be assessed for tax. These are major financial reforms designed to simplify and to multiply giving in our country. And the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) has estimated that our reforms could provide an extra 350 million pounds a year for charities. Incentives to encourage individual giving are the start of the new financial foundation for charities. But we want Britain also to start a new chapter in corporate giving. At present in the USA around 1 per cent of company profits are given to charity. But in Britain it is only 0.2 per cent of company profits It is time for a new start here too. I want to encourage more local companies to be active in civic life in their areas and I want to see more of our international companies becoming giving companies too. So we propose a new tax regime for companies to give more - so that they become companies not just working in the community but working for the community In the last two years, we have made it possible for companies to set against tax gifts of computers and equipment to charities and to schools. From April we are introducing a major innovation. Like individuals, companies can give any amount to charity - no matter how large or small - and get tax relief for the full amount. But in the past, any charitable giving required companies to deduct tax from the gift - and the charities had to claim this back. From April, free of red tape, companies can now give the full amount to charity - no tax to deduct from the gift, no paperwork, no bureaucracy. It has never been simpler. Because we want to make this, the first decade of the new millennium, a decade of giving, we will take special measures as a government to inform, advise on and publicise the new financial measures. To make our new scheme easily understood and easy for companies and individuals to introduce and easy for charities to apply, we are setting up a new telephone help-line. Charities will only need to ring one number to get the advice they need. To make advice simple and readily available in one place we will publish a new directory for charities and new tax guidance. But we want to promote the giving of time as well as money When the active community working group published its report it suggested that: by 2005 two-thirds of adults should be able to undertake at least two hours voluntary activity a week; by 2003 all secondary school pupils should understand how they can participate in community based activities; by 2002 local authority fora to be established to engage employers in community activity programmes. So, in addition to new financial foundations for charities and voluntary action, we need to do much more to create a culture of giving time. Our next task is to encourage new volunteers, create new volunteering opportunities, and to build networks that match those who can give help to those which need help. So how can this be achieved. We are already working with charities and the voluntary sector on key initiatives: first, setting up an Internet-based database - \"The Site\" - providing individuals with free and direct access to volunteering opportunities throughout Britain - 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; second, supporting the campaign being launched by one-20 and the BBC at the end of the month to celebrate volunteering and inspire people to give time; third, funding the development of the first ever community-based digital tv channel - The Media Trust's Community Channel; fourth, establishing new regional networks, which will link the voluntary organisations in each region to the new regional development agencies; fifth, running active community demonstration projects in five areas, testing ways of strengthening community activity and creating new volunteering opportunities. To advance both the giving of money and time, we will bring together all relevant parties - the voluntary sector, key Government departments, business leaders, employees' representatives, and marketing, advertising, media experts - to examine proposals for a national campaign based on a partnership with the voluntary sector. Civic engagement Encouragement to give time and money is one thing. The question to ask myself as I conclude, is how we can work together to do more to advance and highlight the need for civic renewal and the uniqueness of Britain as the home of civic society - how therefore we can extend civic activism and engagement and thus build a new civic strength. I have elsewhere talked about a new kind of Britain, one of growing civic strength where, by defending the individual against the abuse of power and seeking ourselves as citizens of the state and not its subjects, a new sense of community develops. And I have written of a new Britain where there is genuine devolution of power, not centralisation and respect for localism and self governing communities. Indeed, in future people will not wait for Whitehall to solve our problems. Instead of people looking upwards to Whitehall for their solutions, from region to region, locality to locality, more and more people will themselves be in charge of the decisions that affect their lives. But this new Britain of growing civic strength will also be a Britain which evolves that richer and stronger relationship between individual, community and state - the individual empowered in a supportive community. And so the British way - to champion civic life and enhance local initiative and local responsibility - means we should do far more to support voluntary charitable and community action - and empower the forces of compassion and care in our communities that are at the heart of a successful society. Let me give two examples of the new relationship between individuals, communities, and state - and the new role for voluntary work that follows. Sure Start brings a principle into action for the first time for many years - that services for the under-fives not only involve private, voluntary and charitable activities, but can be run through and by them. Sure Start, allowing partnerships to be responsible not only for a defined service but for all services for an area. All the latest evidence is that the first three years are critical to a child's brain development and can have a lifelong impact on a child's intellectual and emotional well being. So we must do more to counteract disadvantages that arise from poverty and lack of support at birth and beyond. Sure Start was allocated 450 million pounds for the next three years. 250 local programmes will be established by 2001. And we are tackling the cause for poverty - lack of educational opportunity, lack of parental support, lack of health advice. What opportunity is there for young children if they are left hobbled/crippled and 100 yards behind in the race of life. We do not want winners and losers, but winners and winners as we broaden the circle of opportunity to include everyone. 5-7 per cent of the child population will benefit directly from Sure Start. Sixty trailblazer areas have been selected and 47 are now up and running. They are based on real communities. Some cover just 85 children, others 4,000, the average 500-800. So this is work in a small area to help those most in need. And we are proposing to spend on average 3,000 pounds more per child per year. But let us be clear about the radicalism of the new principle. Sure Start allows the voluntary sector to be responsible and in charge, not only of a defined service, but all services for under fours in an area. Instead of the state - local or national - running these programmes, these can be run by volunteers, charities, community organisations. Indeed, we should be prepared to pass over the responsibility for services in these geographical areas to the voluntary partnership. And by learning from what works and from each other, spread the best good practice as we extend the project. The proposed New Children's Fund extends this principle. It offers Government money to back non-Government initiatives to tackle child poverty. Again it is a partnership in which the voluntary community and charitable organisations take the lead, using their initiative local knowledge and skill to put their ideas and projects to work. So the new relationship between individual community and Government involves real devolution of power from Government - local and national - to self-governing communities. And as it moves into the next phase, as I will announce in the Budget, the New Deal will seek to work even more closely with voluntary organisations as we both increase the opportunities for the hard to employ young unemployed and adults - with not just training but advice coaching and encouragement. But these are not all the new initiatives where we want to encourage your ideas, your energies, your action, and will support it. We are happy to work with you in developing new ideas. In for example education where I can see how we can do more to extend the helping hand to school children - a new enhanced local network of mentors for children to help them read. Perhaps 100,000 mentors in all parts of the country. In improving the environment, where to avoid what some call the threat of a drawbridge Britain-of walled private communities hidden from each other - we need to look at the better use of public space. In communications, new and better community uses for local tv, radio, media and the Internet. In the classroom better civic education courses and from school more opportunities for young people to do voluntary work. In business extending into a national network the use of mentors that will encourage local small businesses. In the Internet, new computer learning centres engaging public, private and voluntary sectors at the hub of the community. In service overseas, a new boost to working in the developing world. And voluntary action extends to community economic regeneration. In the Pre-Budget Report I announced the 30 million pound Phoenix Fund, part of which will promote community finance initiatives. These provide finance for projects where there are high social returns. So this aims to promote the type of organisations that we have been talking about today. We aim to have this element of the Phoenix Fund up and running in the Spring. So soon local communities will be directly benefiting. We want to do more. So I can announce today the setting up of a Social Investment Task Force. I want to see more investment in the UK in social enterprises - projects which have social objectives, and are not simply profit orientated. This Task Force will look into how this can be achieved, looking at: the case for social investment and a social investment fund; identify barriers to the further development of this field; and propose solutions and models for the future development of social investment. Conclusion So let me conclude Far from being eclipsed by the consumer economy and global markets, care and compassion are with us still and poised to flourish. Indeed together in the new century we will realise a new greatness in Britain not in high politics but in the millions of quiet often uncelebrated deeds and acts of kindness courage and humanity of people all over our country Let us work for a future where Britain's goodness and its greatness are as one Your efforts, initiative and pioneering work -the work of voluntary organisations you represent and advance- are at the heart of Britain's civic renewal and represent the better Britain we want to build in the twenty first century. So let us resolve to use the millennium to realise and celebrate our enduring values. Let us build a new civic patriotism together. Let us have confidence that together we can build a great British society.",

And that personal responsibility was undermined. Gradually this built up into a widely shared anti-collectivist sentiment, expressed by Margaret Thatcher, who sought to introduce a new relationship.

So I start from a view of the future of Britain I will develop as I speak - a Britain becoming a strong and vibrant society, a Britain where our willingness to assist our neighbours is indeed both the strength and the potential of Britain. The best of Britain, which has always resisted the excesses of selfish individualism, just as it has always resisted the excesses of state control.

Indeed some write of a middle England whose comforts make it forget a poor Britain of places and peoples left behind. I believe that the opposite is true: that one of our great British qualities has always been - and is today - our strong sense of personal and civic responsibility and reciprocity - an understanding that those who benefit from citizenship have also an obligation to give something back in return. This is what defines us at our best.

Volunteering, falling elsewhere as traditional associations and organisations fade, is - according to a recent study by Peter Hall - not falling in Britain, as new organisations like the playgroup and child care movement strengthen Britain's social capital. But we know that despite the imagination and creativity - as well as the hard work - of charitable and voluntary organisations, donations to charities has fallen in the nineties, well under one percent of our national income, while an even more disappointing figure of 0.2 per cent of profits, one fifth of the USA, can be reported for corporate giving. And we know from your survey today that among the young, voluntary work has been falling out of fashion, with the result that last year less - 22 million - volunteered than the 23 million active in the early nineties. So, today, I want to chart new territory for this Government. I want to give new reasons why for us, voluntary work and voluntary giving is more important than it ever was. I want to outline the case for a new and stronger relationship between individual, community and Government - for the renewal of British civic society - a great British society which not only defines anew the importance of voluntary organisations, but engenders a civic patriotism. I want to propose a new financial foundation for this civic renewal - a modern financial foundation for charitable, voluntary and community action. And I want to suggest - for discussion - new ways that in this, the first decade of the new millennium, we can all play our part in encouraging greater civic engagement in the years ahead. It is too often forgotten today that the Labour Party itself grew out of voluntary organisations, friendly societies and mutual aid organisations, and that the inspiration of many of its leaders comes from an involvement in the voluntary sector. One of those people was a great Labour leader : Clement Atlee. He spoke to you at your first conference in 1920 - as a London Mayor, the Mayor of Stepney - and wrote a book on voluntary action whose principles remain as valid today as they were back in the 1920s: \"The social service movement of modern times is not confined to any one class, nor is it the preserve of dull and respectable people. It has arisen out of a deep discontent with society as at present constituted.\" He argued that the vast variety and range of activity in the voluntary and charitable sector needs to be recognised. Now today, 80 years on in the year 2000, there is a real debate about the relationship between individual, community and state. Not least because in the 70s as I will suggest, we reached the limits of big government practically and intellectually and, in the 80s, we found we reached the limits of free market dogma. Let me describe how I see the changing history of the relationship between individual initiative, voluntary and community action and the state. Few would disagree about the benefits that came from the creation of the welfare state and the National Health Service, replacing an untidy patchwork of local municipal voluntary provision and providing comprehensive services at a scale previously unknown. For millions, the welfare state was a deliverance from evil, taking the shame out of need, giving British citizens rights they would otherwise not have to education, social security, employment and health care, rights that cannot be guaranteed other than by the state. So a new relationship after 1945 emerged between the state, the individual and community, where the individual was increasingly empowered by the state acting on behalf of the community. But unintentionally, particularly as the welfare state grew in size over the following decades, that state increasingly became a substitute for communities. This was not what the architect of the welfare state, William Beveridge, had intended. In 1948, as I am sure you know, he published the report entitled a \"Voluntary Action\" which was intended as a complement to his earlier work on the welfare state. At that time he said: \"We must continue to use to the full the spirit that made our great organisations for mutual aid and that fired the philanthropists of the past.\" There grew a sense that individual initiative was stifled in the process. And that personal responsibility was undermined. Gradually this built up into a widely shared anti-collectivist sentiment, expressed by Margaret Thatcher, who sought to introduce a new relationship. Her view was that individuals should be left on their own, and that this was to be achieved by a withering away of the state. The thinking was summarised in what was her most famous remark: \"There is no such thing as society.\" This is a wholly different and in my view unacceptable view of the relationship between individual community and government. In this perspective there was a role for charity, but not the partnership most of us now want to talk about; not so much government and charities working together to expand activity, but charities having to take over where government withdrew. Added to that, contract financing, where the contracts are written in Whitehall without proper consultation, tended to discourage one great source of charities strength - innovation - and left charities often with responsibility where once government acted, but with no influence for change. So while in the 1970s we had reached the acceptable limits of big government, in the 1980s and 1990s we saw just as clearly the practical limits in our society of a market free-for-all. Arthur Schlesinger has described a cycle in social history that runs from individualism to collectivism and back. So we have seen the revolt from the right against over powerful government, hence the emphasis on personal and civic responsibility. And, in turn, the response of the left to the consequences of over-powerful markets, hence recent ideas for reinventing government. And just as the right belatedly recognised that personal responsibility alone cannot ever in itself constitute social policy while structural injustices persist, so the left are coming to recognise the importance of personal responsibility. In other words the left have accepted that personal responsibility is necessary to social progress, the right have accepted that in itself it is not sufficient. Out of the reaction against the Left's over emphasis on government and the Right's blind faith in markets, a new more balanced approach has emerged, one that sees the individual enhanced by a supportive community and envisions a strong and effective civic society in what we might think of as the middle ground between markets and state. And it is in this middle ground that we are seeing a new partnership develop between the individual, voluntary action and government. Where does it start? These developments are rooted, as I see it, in a positive and optimistic view of human nature, seeing people not just as self-centred but also sociable and co-operative; or to put it another way, seeing ourselves as inter-dependent as much as we are independent.

To have provided an account of Caravaggio's life and death that is considerably sillier and less likely than Jarman's is Robb's dubious achievement... This astonishingly awful book does nothing right, nothing graceful. Calling itself M is the first of a torrent of ugly and terrible misjudgments.\"</p> <p>Philip Hensher, in the <strong>Observer</strong>, was the third in this trinity of deadly foes: \"This is an absolutely awful book, just ghastly in every single respect. There is a certain amount of interesting material here, and Robb has done a great deal of homework. But the interesting nuggets are buried among speculation stated as solid fact... it's annoying to finish a biography and feel that you know less about its subject than you did when you started it.\"</p> <p>Robb's streetwise style and willingness to fill in the large gaps in Caravaggio's CV profoundly irritated the purists, yet he did have his supporters: \"Anyone wondering how you might write in a partisan, pugnacious, useful way about the Old Masters - enlivening those Dead White European males in their gilt frames - could do much worse than read Peter Robb's M,\" wrote Julian Bell in an elegant review in the <strong>Guardian</strong>. \"Here we have a story about a painter who gives a culture that has gone numb a new throb of life; one who opens up previously unrepresented areas of feeling with a pictorial approach of revolutionary directness.</p> <p>\"M is a hopelessly uncool, vulgarian performance by most art-historical lights... But it's a great read: it grabs, it kicks, it lives. Robb has gazed long in the galleries and dim-lit churches where the primary evidence for the painter's life remains; has then spread his writing desk with the earliest memoirs of Caravaggio and with a haul of four-century-old Roman police records brought to light by recent scholarship. He shuttles furiously between the images and the transcripts, stitching faces to names, weaving together a whole lost world of loves and hatreds and the jostly, shouty street-life of which Caravaggio's paintings are the still-astonishing trace.\" </p> <p>(Bell attacked the lack of colour plates in the book, and quite right too - the life of a painter without the paintings is like the life of a critic without the moans.)</p> <p>Joan Smith, in the <strong>Independent on Sunday</strong>, was even more admiring: \"One of the achievements of Peter Robb's spectacular, daring biography is to place the notorious artist in the context of the brutal times in which he existed. What does emerge from this bold book... is a sense of Caravaggio struggling against both his temperament and his moment in history. In the circumstances, the fact that he survived to the age of 38 and produced so many extraordinary paintings represents a triumph in what is otherwise a life characterised by the doomed inevitability of Greek tragedy.\"</p> <p>Andrew Graham-Dixon, in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, also hailed the book's boldness: \"Robb's ambition to reinvent the Caravaggio of popular myth, as well as reinvestigate the facts of his strange life and death, is implicit in his renaming of the artist, to whom he irritatingly refers throughout as 'M'. This is an abbreviation of Caravaggio's given Christian name, Michelangelo, used for reasons which are never fully explained.</p> <p>\"Written in a vehemently passionate and aggressively colloquial style, M is likely to be dismissed in some quarters as insufficiently scholarly and excessively populist. [But] even though Robb dogmatically refuses to recognise the spiritual dimensions of Caravaggio's art - such is his determination to make the painter a disconsolate, faithless modern avant la lettre - it must be said that he writes consistently well and sometimes brilliantly about the humanity and the drama of the pictures... M is an abrasive, flawed, idiosyncratic book, but it is full of energy.\"</p> <p>The two positions - pulp it or praise it - seemed irreconcilable, but Martin Gayford in the <strong>Sunday Telegraph</strong> found a middle way: \"It is in many ways a most exasperating book, littered with eccentricities, large and small. The titles of Caravaggio's paintings are recast in a blunt, demotic mode in which The Death of the Virgin becomes Mary Dead; The Martyrdom of St Matthew, Matthew Killed. More serious is a tendency to build conjecture on conjecture with disconcerting abandon.\"</p> <p>So far, so Sewell, but then the (strictly qualified) support: \"Robb is very good at reconstructing the seedy milieu of courtesans, pimps and artists which Caravaggio inhabited, and at evoking the darkness, Mafia-style corruption and tyranny of Counter-Reformation Italy (the author's first, well-received book was about Sicily). There are pages on which Caravaggio really does seem to move and snarl again. Had it been less breathtakingly self-indulgent, this could have been a brilliant book.\"</p> <p>A lost opportunity then, but perhaps not worthy of the scorn of those killer critics, Sewell, Januszczak and Hensher. In this instance, dial M for moderation.</p>",

Benarsko Gaisey, 35, was found guilty of four rapes and an indecent assault on three women and remanded in custody by Judge John Rogers at the Old Bailey. Gaisey carried out his attacks after luring women he met in the West End to his home in Stoke Newington. Police believe he is guilty of a string of attacks, some unreported because they were carried out on tourists who left the country. A 17-year-old Italian student who Gaisey raped twice suffered serious injuries when she tried to escape through a window while he slept. Police took the unusual step of issuing Gaisey's photograph in the summer of 1997, warning women he was \"extremely dangerous\". Two other women came forward to complain about sexual assaults committed by Gaisey, whom they knew as Samson Mensah. Gaisey, an illegal immigrant, used a variety of aliases to work in the West End. The day after the attack on the Italian student, he was arrested and bailed. He disappeared, and was eventually traced to Ghana and extradited to Britain last year.",

      "body": "<p>When Giorgio Roifer first set his eyes on the beautiful forest of Barental near Klagenfurt in the southern Austrian Tyrol, he thought he had found the perfect estate to expand his burgeoning timber business. The Russian-born Jewish entrepreneur, who had become a naturalised Italian, lived with his wife and three children in Pisa. They had servants, horses and two cars. He had timber and sawmill interests all over Italy and southern Austria, and when he acquired the 3,700-acre Barental estate at the age of 37, it seemed the ideal addition to his growing empire.</p> <p>But his wife and children were destined never to see Barental. Less than a year after Roifer bought the estate in 1937, Hitler became the ruler of Austria under the Anschluss. When Roifer visited Barental in 1938, he found a sign on the door of the Moser Hotel where he used to stay in Klagenfurt. It said: \"Dogs and Jews are not welcome.\"</p> <p>The Nazis embarked on a ruthless policy of Aryanisation - forcing Jews to sell their property and leave the country. Roifer died that year, and soon after the land was sold to a man called Josef Webhofer, who left it to his son Wilhelm.</p> <p>Today, it belongs to J\u00f6rg Haider, leader of the far-right Austrian Freedom party, who received it as a gift in 1986 from Webhofer, his great-uncle. Worth about \u00a310m, the hunting, fishing, shooting and wood-logging estate is the basis of the vast fortune that has made Haider one of the wealthiest men in Austria. The original sale was, however, illegal.

      "bodyText": "When Giorgio Roifer first set his eyes on the beautiful forest of Barental near Klagenfurt in the southern Austrian Tyrol, he thought he had found the perfect estate to expand his burgeoning timber business. The Russian-born Jewish entrepreneur, who had become a naturalised Italian, lived with his wife and three children in Pisa. They had servants, horses and two cars. He had timber and sawmill interests all over Italy and southern Austria, and when he acquired the 3,700-acre Barental estate at the age of 37, it seemed the ideal addition to his growing empire. But his wife and children were destined never to see Barental. Less than a year after Roifer bought the estate in 1937, Hitler became the ruler of Austria under the Anschluss. When Roifer visited Barental in 1938, he found a sign on the door of the Moser Hotel where he used to stay in Klagenfurt. It said: \"Dogs and Jews are not welcome.\" The Nazis embarked on a ruthless policy of Aryanisation - forcing Jews to sell their property and leave the country. Roifer died that year, and soon after the land was sold to a man called Josef Webhofer, who left it to his son Wilhelm. Today, it belongs to J\u00f6rg Haider, leader of the far-right Austrian Freedom party, who received it as a gift in 1986 from Webhofer, his great-uncle. Worth about \u00a310m, the hunting, fishing, shooting and wood-logging estate is the basis of the vast fortune that has made Haider one of the wealthiest men in Austria. The original sale was, however, illegal. If Haider's family had not deceived Roifer's widow years after the war, the estate would still belong to her family. Roifer's son, Alexander, who many believe is the rightful heir to Barental, lives today in a modest apartment in a middle-class Jerusalem suburb called French Hill, far removed from the grandeur of Pisa or the beauty of Barental. White-haired, bespectacled, a professor of Bible studies at the nearby Hebrew university, he seems bemused by the sudden interest in his family history and is reluctant to talk about Haider. He tells the story of the estate in measured tones, despite the disturbing memories it stirs. Roifer says his mother, who died in 1995, was forced to sell the estate for a fraction of its real value, and never discovered that she had been tricked into giving it up until it was too late. \"I am certainly not happy about what happened, but I do not wake up every morning angry about it,\" he says. \"A man builds his life and fortunately I have found other things to keep me busy and interested.

The pattern emerges quite clearly: government is making laws out of particular cases and eroding the general principles in order to secure a particular aim. It wants to bring to justice the people none of us have any time for: financial swindlers, racist thugs, paedophiles, war criminals, drug dealers and terrorists. Others might include rapists, petty professional criminals who are \"obviously guilty\", and multiple offenders whose record will be known to magistrates, but not to juries. In the interest of bringing these low lifes to justice, the principles which protect the liberties of all of us are swept away. The precepts which have guarded society are destroyed to target particular groups of offenders. After all, we do not want them getting off, do we? In some cases, though, we might accept that, preferring a few unsavoury individuals to walk free rather than compromise the foundations on which our liberties depend. We give the devil himself the benefit of our laws, for how could we otherwise claim it ourselves? \u0095 Dr Madsen Pirie is president of the Adam Smith Institute",

In one of the most detailed speeches on medical research issues given by a US president, Mr Clinton barred American federal government agencies from discriminating against employees on the basis of genetic tests. He also gave his backing to a senate bill which aims to extend similar protections to the private sector and insurance purchasers. Concern is mounting that genetic testing and research which allow doctors to predict the future health of their patients are already being used to discriminate against workers, and to assess insurance risks. \"This extraordinary march of human understanding imposes on us a profound responsibility to make sure that the age of discovery can continue to reflect our most cherished values,\" Mr Clinton said yesterday. \"We must protect our citizens' privacy - the bulwark of personal liberty, the safeguard of individual creativity.\" Mr Clinton also waded into the current controversy over problems surrounding clinical trials of gene therapies. Gene therapy research projects at several US centres have been halted since news of the death of a patient in a university of Pennsylvania experiment last year became public. The president announced that federal health bodies must \"expedite their review of gene therapy guidelines and regulations to determine whether the current informed consent requirements need to be strengthened.\" The president announced his initiatives yesterday in a speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington. In addition to issuing an executive order affecting every federal government department and agency, Mr Clinton said he endorsed a bill sponsored by the Democratic senators Tom Daschle and Edward Kennedy and the Republican congresswoman Louise Slaughter, which extends the same provisions to the private sector. The Daschle bill would prohibit all employers from refusing to hire workers who are at risk as a result of health problems and would prevent insurers refusing to sell them cover. Mr Clinton, who spoke with Dr Francis Collins, the director of the US human genome research institute, standing at his side, echoed a plea which he has made in several recent speeches, including in his recent state of the union address that \"we must see that science serves humanity, not the other way around\". Mr Clinton said it was vital not to allow concerns about the misuse of genetic information to discourage people from seeking the tests which could improve their lives. \"If we do not protect the right to privacy, we may actually impede the reach of these breakthroughs in the lives of ordinary people, which would be a profound tragedy,\" he said. The White House said that the speech sent \"a powerful message\" to the private sector to adopt a similar approach. \"I think it starts an important process on an issue that all the surveys show Americans are very concerned about, moving into the future,\" presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. The central issue in the new policy initiative is to prevent progress in genetic testing from being used by employers and risk assessors to discriminate against workers - including those who have not yet or may never show the signs of illness - in an attempt to avoid possible health care costs. The fear of such discrimination is very real, American research has shown. A 1996 study in the journal Science showed that 15% of individuals who had been identified as being at risk of developing a genetic condition reported that they had been asked questions about genetic diseases on job applications. One in 10 claimed that they had been denied a job or had been fired because of a genetic condition in their families. Such experiences and anxieties are likely to increase in the coming years as improved medical research techniques mean that more people become aware of their own genetic conditions. A 1997 study by the US national centre for genome resources found that 63% of people surveyed would not take genetic tests if they believed that employers were able to have access to the results. In addition, half of the survey respondents said they believed that most employers were likely to ask their workers to take genetic tests in the future.",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday began fighting a legal ruling which renders roadside speed cameras useless and curtails the police's ability to investigate drink-driving offences. Lawyers took the first steps to appeal against the ruling at Edinburgh high court which allows car owners to refuse to tell police who was behind the wheel at the time of any driving offence. The ruling means motorists can refuse to say who was driving a car caught speeding by roadside cameras and threatens to throw the whole system of traffic policing into disarray. Last week, Scotland's top judge, Lord Rodger, ruled that compelling motorists to disclose the information on threat of prosecution was in breach of their human rights. The ruling is based on the European convention on human rights, which was adopted into Scottish law last May. The appeal judges agreed that section 172 of the road traffic act, which makes it an offence for motorists not to tell police who was driving their vehicle at the time of an alleged offence, contravenes the right to silence and the right against self-incrimination. The section is crucial to sustaining convictions from roadside cameras and is used in some hit-and-run and drink-driving prosecutions. For the moment the ruling concerns only Scottish motorists but, if the government is unsuccessful in its appeal, its effects will also be felt in the rest of the UK when the convention is adopted in October. The original appeal was brought by a woman stopped in a supermarket car park in Dunfermline, Fife, last year. Police noticed that Margaret Brown, from Dunfermline, smelled of alcohol and, when they asked her how she got to the shop, she told them she had travelled by car. Ms Brown pointed her car out to officers, and she was asked formally - under the road traffic act - to say who was driving the car. Ms Brown admitted that she was at the wheel and she was charged with two offences, including driving while under the influence of excessive alcohol. Her lawyers argued that making Ms Brown disclose who was driving her car infringed her right to a fair trial. Last week Lord Rodger ruled Ms Brown was subjected to compulsion to incriminate herself under threat of being found guilty of an offence. He acknowledged this would have a \"momentous effect on the use of roadside cameras\". A spokesman for the department of transport said: \"We are studying the judgment and deciding what measures we need to take to conform to the convention on human rights.\"",

Soon afterwards Peter Pike asked Michael Meacher what he would do about \"this discarded chewing gum problem we meet everywhere?\" Mr Meacher played for time. \"I am certainly not 'stuck up' with this kind of problem!\" (Loud laughter. This is an example of parliamentary humour, and so impenetra ble to normal humans.) \"But it is disgusting. I am in touch with the major manufacturers to ask if they can find a way of providing biodegradable chewing gum.\" Later we moved on to the bill that dissolves the Northern Ireland assembly. Martin McGuinness, over in England on a charm offensive, like a rottweiler learning to curtsey, stared glumly down. He was perfectly placed to drop a grenade on the Rev Ian Paisley, although of course he didn't: Mr Paisley's existence is far too valuable for the IRA. After one attack on Sinn Fein, Mr McGuinness rose and stalked out, tugging a strand of non-degradable chewing gum with him. (Sadly, I made that bit up.)",

With even the Daily Mail forced by its own polls to recognise \"the tolerance, generous, live-and-let live instincts of the British people\", ministers believed there would be little difficulty in repealing section 28 of the local government act, which bans the promotion of homosexuality by schools or local councils. The Mail poll found 68% of the British public saw nothing wrong in teaching children that a gay lifestyle should be tolerated. What ministers failed to take into account was the fervour of evangelical groups, the intolerance of many religious leaders, the homophobia of rightwing newspapers, and the implacable nature of Baroness Young, the former Tory minister, who has led the opposition to the government's moves in the Lords.</p> <p>At the beginning of Monday's debate on the local government bill, the Bishop of Blackburn introduced an amendment which answered all the fears raised by the opponents of the repeal. The bishop's amendment would have got rid of the section and and introduced a substitute clause. It would have declared that marriage should be the fundamental building block of the family, but that pupils' sexual orientation should be allowed to develop without being subjected to any physical or verbal abuse or to any encouragement of sexual activity.

      "bodyText": "It was an easy mistake to make. With even the Daily Mail forced by its own polls to recognise \"the tolerance, generous, live-and-let live instincts of the British people\", ministers believed there would be little difficulty in repealing section 28 of the local government act, which bans the promotion of homosexuality by schools or local councils. The Mail poll found 68% of the British public saw nothing wrong in teaching children that a gay lifestyle should be tolerated. What ministers failed to take into account was the fervour of evangelical groups, the intolerance of many religious leaders, the homophobia of rightwing newspapers, and the implacable nature of Baroness Young, the former Tory minister, who has led the opposition to the government's moves in the Lords. At the beginning of Monday's debate on the local government bill, the Bishop of Blackburn introduced an amendment which answered all the fears raised by the opponents of the repeal. The bishop's amendment would have got rid of the section and and introduced a substitute clause. It would have declared that marriage should be the fundamental building block of the family, but that pupils' sexual orientation should be allowed to develop without being subjected to any physical or verbal abuse or to any encouragement of sexual activity. This was not just in line with ministerial thinking, but brought together both sides: the Church of England, the Catholic Education Society and the leading Catholic weekly, the Tablet, on one side, and Stonewall, the gay pressure group which was set up in 1989 to fight section 28, on the other.

      "bodyText": "EU sanctions against Serbia are to be tightened to hit the Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic's ruling elite harder, while a ban on flights will be lifted in an attempt to boost opposition activity. Diplomats in Brussels said last night that EU foreign ministers are expected to agree next Monday to add some 300 new names to an existing 600 strong blacklist. Members of the Yugoslav judiciary as well as key industrialists and business leaders are likely to be banned from travel in Europe. The aim is to hit the outer circle of power in Belgrade as well as big companies which earn badly-needed hard currency for the regime by freezing their funds in and transactions with EU member states. At the same time, the lifting of the flight ban is designed to encourage the opposition by signalling that ordinary Serbs are not being held responsible for their leadership - a lesson learned the hard way from years of punitive UN sanctions against Iraq. Last month Britain and the Netherlands were isolated in their defence of the EU's flight ban as France and Italy led calls for ending it. EU member states have been divided over what to do about sanctions as long as President Milosevic remains in power, even though his domestic opponents favour lifting both the flight ban and an oil embargo. The US is strongly against lifting the oil embargo, even though it is widely breached. Since the end of the Kosovo war last summer, the EU has been involved in sending heating oil to two opposition-held towns in Serbia, Nis and Pirot, under its energy for democracy programme. But there are disagreements over whether it should be extended to towns which are not opposed to the Yugoslav president. \"This extension of the visa ban is more than just symbolic,\" one EU diplomat said yesterday. \"This is a measure which has caused very great irritation in Milosevic's circle. People have been very greatly inconvenienced so it's been a very effective sanction.\" EU countries are looking to build cooperation with the Serbian people, if not the state, as the opposition tries to overcome divisions and build a united anti-Milosevic platform.

The increased border security, along with extra foot patrols in the northern part of the Kosovan town, followed the worst attack on Albanian civilians by Serbs since K-For troops arrived last June. At least five people died and up to 30 were injured on Thursday night after French troops failed to stop gangs firing bullets and throwing grenades into Albanian flats. They also burned vehicles belonging to the United Nations police and aid agencies. The ostensible trigger for the assault was a grenade attack on a bus last Wednesday which killed two Serbs. Crowds of Albanians have turned out daily to jeer at the French soldiers who are in charge of security and who have continually blocked free access across Mitrovice's three bridges. The northern part of the town is largely populated by Serbs and the south by Albanians. The protesters' claims that the French have allowed Mitrovice to slide into partition are receiving an increasingly sympathetic hearing from members of the international police deployed in the town. An American officer with the UN police said his Albanian interpreter saw Serbs hand out grenades on Saturday. \"He rang a colleague at police headquarters on the southern side who alerted me. I asked K-For to do something, but the French told me they didn't want to inflame the Serbs. \"The rules of engagement are screwed up,\" he said. \"When it's an issue of weapons, the police cannot go in unless we're accompanied by K-For.

      "bodyText": "The assassination of the Yugoslav defence minister, Pavle Bulatovic, has raised the spectre of civil unrest in the small republic of Montenegro as rival clans start settling scores. Analysts in Belgrade are linking Monday night's killing to the feud between Montenegro's government - which wants to extricate itself from the Yugoslav federation, where its state is Serbia's sole partner - and the northern Montenegrin clans. These clans include the Bulatovic family, who are loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. The minister, 51, was killed by automatic gunfire on Monday night in what the Yugoslav authorities described as \"a classic terrorist act\". The killer opened fire through the window of a restaurant in the Banjica suburb of Belgrade as the minister was sitting at his favourite table. Two other people were wounded, including the former general and bank director, Vuk Obradovic. The killing of Pavle Bulatovic has caused shock and confusion in Belgrade and in his native Montenegro. Unlike others in the political elite in Yugoslavia, he was considered a modest man untainted by corruption or black market activities. Neither was he among Serb leaders charged by the UN tribunal in The Hague with war crimes in Kosovo war last year, nor linked in press reports to the past decade of political and underworld killings in Serbia. The Serb paramilitary leader Zeljko \"Arkan\" Raznatovic, assassinated in a Belgrade hotel last month, had been the most recent of these. However at the time of Arkan's killing the Yugoslav information minister, Goran Matic, blamed the Montenegrin mafia - remarks he later denied making. Bulatovic was a staunch supporter of President Milosevic and one of the fiercest critics of the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, who has made a series of moves to break up what is left of Yugoslavia. The minister was active in organising clan meetings in northern Montenegro to rally support for continued federal rule from Belgrade. There is a danger that Bulatovic's family and political followers will accuse the Montenegrin authorities of the murder and that pro-Belgrade clans may start fomenting plans to avenge the killing. This could further destabilise Montenegro where tensions are already high as a result of President Djukanovic's defiance of Belgrade and courtship of the west. Inevitably there are those in Serbia who have blamed the west - the all-purpose bogeyman - for the Bulatovic murder. The Serb ultra-nationalist leader, Vojislav Seselj, whose own bodyguard was shot dead last month, accused the British, French and American intelligence services of carrying out the assassination. \"Their goal is to bring to power in Yugoslavia incompetent opposition leaders who are toadies to the west,\" said Mr Seselj's Serbian Radical party. The Belgrade authorities have responded to the killing by announcing a \"strong battle against the biggest evil of mankind at the end of the 20th century: terrorism\". The announcement was made at a special joint session of the Yugoslav and Serbian governments, presided over by Mr Milosevic. The authorities are under pressure to show that they are still in control of a society that is increasingly violent and lawless. But officials have yet to give any concrete details of their proposed fight against terrorism. Opposition leaders have expressed the fear that the assassination could be used as the pretext for a general crackdown against President Milosevic's opponents. Yesterday at a memorial service in Belgrade, colleagues paid tribute to Bulatovic. \"The Yugoslav army and the defence ministry have lost a leading man in its organisation, an army minister who was first in the line of the defence of the fatherland,\" said the army chief, General Dragoljub Ojdanic. Memorial services were also held in regional army headquarters throughout Serbia.",

Although the damage was described by the Lebanese government as more extensive than in last June, when the capital was reduced to severe electricity rationing for several months, the toll of civilian casualties - 18 wounded, one gravely - was smaller. The midnight-to-dawn blitz targeted the outskirts of Beirut, the ancient city of Baalbek, the outskirts of the northern town of Tripoli, and the mountain town of Zgharta - all sites of power stations.

      "body": "<p>Most London guide books confine themselves to introducing visitors to principal hotels, recommending a few good restaurants and extolling the virtues of St Paul's Cathedral. But tourists who pick up the Lonely Planet guide will be educated in underground etiquette, warned of the perils of \"white van man\" and directed to the Millennium Dome for architectural inspiration.</p> <p>In a controversial assessment of Londoners, they are described as victims of increased pollution and overcrowding, leading to an increasingly aggressive manner.</p> <p>While the guide is quick to point out the drawbacks of what it describes as one of the planet's most crowded cities, it is also keen to stress the positive aspects of London which are rarely celebrated. The dome, for instance, replaces more traditional tourist attractions as a must-see.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the negative spin is predictably challenged by those tasked with attracting visitors to Britain. The London tourist board insisted that far from being turned off by the capital's cheesed-off inhabitants, Londoners are viewed as almost universally friendly and helpful.</p> <p>The guide, which is published today, warns visitors that Londoners are not the easiest breed with which to strike up companionships. \"It's not especially easy to cause offence in London - unless you're trying to. Having said that, it's worth remembering that most Londoners would no more speak to a stranger in the street than fly to the moon.\"</p> <p>Visitors are told of the capital's residents: \"Don't try and be their friend: they're too absorbed in their own world of workmates, school friends and family.\" However, if their world is successfully breached, Londoners make the most loyal and trustworthy friends, it stresses - even if they are blighted by road rage. (Beware of white van man's propensity to \"punch your lights out - ie do untold damage to you\".)</p> <p>The guide's authors - Steve Fallon from Boston, Massachusetts and Pat Yale, from Bristol - are particularly exercised by the ageing underground system (\"slow, unreliable, and terribly expensive\"). It does, however, have a \"rigid etiquette\" which visitors ignore at their peril. \"Where there's an escalator you absolutely must stand on the right so that people in a hurry or keen to get in some exercise can rush up or down on the left. This is an extremely important rule - we kid you not - and should you break it you risk getting pushed aside or verbally abused.\"</p> <p>Responding to the guide, Louise Wood, of the London tourist board, denied that the capital's citizens are difficult. \"All our surveys indicate tourists think Londoners are very friendly.

      "bodyText": "Most London guide books confine themselves to introducing visitors to principal hotels, recommending a few good restaurants and extolling the virtues of St Paul's Cathedral. But tourists who pick up the Lonely Planet guide will be educated in underground etiquette, warned of the perils of \"white van man\" and directed to the Millennium Dome for architectural inspiration. In a controversial assessment of Londoners, they are described as victims of increased pollution and overcrowding, leading to an increasingly aggressive manner. While the guide is quick to point out the drawbacks of what it describes as one of the planet's most crowded cities, it is also keen to stress the positive aspects of London which are rarely celebrated. The dome, for instance, replaces more traditional tourist attractions as a must-see. Nevertheless, the negative spin is predictably challenged by those tasked with attracting visitors to Britain. The London tourist board insisted that far from being turned off by the capital's cheesed-off inhabitants, Londoners are viewed as almost universally friendly and helpful. The guide, which is published today, warns visitors that Londoners are not the easiest breed with which to strike up companionships. \"It's not especially easy to cause offence in London - unless you're trying to. Having said that, it's worth remembering that most Londoners would no more speak to a stranger in the street than fly to the moon.\" Visitors are told of the capital's residents: \"Don't try and be their friend: they're too absorbed in their own world of workmates, school friends and family.\" However, if their world is successfully breached, Londoners make the most loyal and trustworthy friends, it stresses - even if they are blighted by road rage. (Beware of white van man's propensity to \"punch your lights out - ie do untold damage to you\".) The guide's authors - Steve Fallon from Boston, Massachusetts and Pat Yale, from Bristol - are particularly exercised by the ageing underground system (\"slow, unreliable, and terribly expensive\"). It does, however, have a \"rigid etiquette\" which visitors ignore at their peril. \"Where there's an escalator you absolutely must stand on the right so that people in a hurry or keen to get in some exercise can rush up or down on the left. This is an extremely important rule - we kid you not - and should you break it you risk getting pushed aside or verbally abused.\" Responding to the guide, Louise Wood, of the London tourist board, denied that the capital's citizens are difficult. \"All our surveys indicate tourists think Londoners are very friendly. Four out of five visitors thought people here were quite friendly or very friendly. And even the underground equals or exceeds visitors' expectations,\" she said. However, Jennifer Cox, of Lonely Planet, stood by the guide's strident assertions. \"I challenge anybody to say that they don't recognise the view of London in this book. The sheer volume of people and traffic is driving us to become very aggressive,\" she said.",

      "bodyText": "A police chief accused of sexual misconduct against female employees is to be retired on medical grounds after he was found to be mentally ill. Andrew Timpson, the chief constable of Warwickshire, went on sick leave one day after misconduct allegations surfaced last September. Last night Warwickshire police authority refused to say what settlement Mr Timpson would receive after leaving his \u00a387,000-a-year job, but it is expected that he will receive an annual pension of \u00a357,000. A five-month investigation, headed by Norman Bettison, the chief constable of Merseyside, found that Mr Timpson was depressed and had been prescribed the anti-depressant drug Prozac. Mr Timpson, 48, failed to cope with the pressures of the job he started in 1998 and a psychologist who examined him concluded that the Prozac could have stripped him of his usual inhibitions. The Warwickshire police authority chairman, John Rennie, said Mr Timpson will not face disciplinary action. \"We cannot crucify him by hauling him before a hearing,\" he said. Mr Rennie said four of the five allegations against Mr Timpson were accepted, with the exception of one alleging that in April 1999, he had made improper sexual remarks to a female colleague. In July of the same year, he ordered a male officer to arrange a date for him with a woman officer from another force. Mr Rennie said: \"She was not interested. It was very irresponsible for a chief constable to send out somebody to fix them up with a date.\" Mr Timpson also admitted that he tried to enlist the services of a management consultant friend to assess his own performance without the correct authority. He also instructed an officer to see that a candidate for the post of chief constable's driver passed a test necessary to getting the job. When a vacancy for the same job arose months later, he is also said to have offered the position to a female member of staff regardless of whether she was suitable for the job. Mr Rennie said: \"Mr Timpson's behaviour and comments on occasions were inappropriate and fell below the accept able standards that one would expect of a chief constable. \"He accepts the allegations although, because of his condition, he does not recall every one of them\". Mr Bettison, who conducted the inquiry, said: \"If one were to take each individual allegation in isolation then, objectively, one might say there was a need for advice or rebuke. \"With the exception of the insulting comment, one might conclude that each allegation would not warrant a full disciplinary hearing.\" Mr Rennie said Mr Timpson's behaviour, which included \"unpredictable mood swings\", was totally out of character and was the result of stress and possibly a side effect of Prozac, which he had been prescribed. He had been put on sick leave in September 1999 by his own GP, who diagnosed him as suffering from \"stress and agitated depression\". A source with knowledge of the internal inquiry told the Guardian that Mr Timpson was genuinely ill and was not hiding behind ill health as an excuse to avoid further action. A medical report prepared by a consultant occupational physician, Lyndon Wall, said the chief constable's conduct came at a time of personal and professional stress. As well as being appointed to his new role in Warwickshire, he headed a labyrinthine police corruption inquiry, Operation Lancet, into the Cleveland police force. \"All the allegations took place in a period after he was taking the drug Prozac. One of the drug's reported side-effects is a disinhibition of behaviour,\" Dr Wall said. \"Domestic problems and particularly some inbuilt way of dealing with stress were also factors. He had no history of mental illness. \"I assessed him as permanently medically unfit to return to his post as chief constable or any other comparable post and recommend he is retired on grounds of ill health,\" Dr Wall added.

      "bodyText": "The new Tate Modern museum - \"the greatest new art gallery for a century\" - will be free for all, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, guaranteed yesterday. But as he praised the Tate for bringing in the \u00a3135m museum, on the south bank of the Thames, in London, on time and on budget, Mr Smith's dream of free universal admission to all national collections seemed to be fading fast. Children can already get into all of them for nothing - and pensioners will be able to do the same from April - but Mr Smith's goal to extend the scheme to everyone from next year has been blocked by several museums which currently charge. They say a proposed \u00a330m government compensation deal would not cover their losses at the ticket office. With several institutions, led by the V&amp;A and the Science Museum, both in London, also arguing that they would lose out on VAT rebates if they did not charge, Mr Smith was forced yesterday to revise his plans and say merely that he was \"committed to making sure that those museums that do not charge for admission should continue to be free\". Even so he refused to admit defeat. He said talks would continue over the next month. The extra money needed is around \u00a310m, a fraction of the lottery cash that Mr Smith, as a millennium commissioner, loaned the dome last week to cover its cash flow crisis. \"There is money on the table, but some museums are very keen on charging,\" Mr Smith said. \"It is up to their trustees.

      "bodyText": "The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, came under pressure last night to stop sitting as a judge in the House of Lords after a judgment by the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The court ruled that a Guernsey flower grower who was refused planning consent to turn his flower-packing shed into a home, was denied a fair hearing when his appeal was heard by a judge who also presided over the island's legislature. The judgment could severely limit Lord Irvine's role as a judge to the point where it becomes impractical for him to exercise it except in a limited range of cases. Seven judges ruled unanimously that Richard McGonnell was denied a \"fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal\" when the bailiff of Guernsey, the island's senior judge, turned down his planning appeal. The bailiff had presided over the legislature years before when the island's draft development plan, which affected the future use of his shed, was approved. The Strasbourg judges ruled that the bailiff's role in hearing the planning case violated the fair hearing guarantee in the European convention on human rights although he has only a casting vote in the legislature. There was no suggestion of bias, said the seven judges, but the fact that he presided over the legislature when the plan was approved was \"capable of casting doubt on his impartiality\". The judges said any direct involvement in the passage of legislation or executive rules was likely to be sufficient to raise doubts if a judge was later called on to determine a dispute over the interpretation of the act or rules. Lawyers said that the ruling would prevent Lord Irvine from sitting as a judge on any case involving legislation passed or amended since the Labour party came to power, or any legislation of the previous government during whose passage he played an active role as opposition spokesman. It may also stop him sitting on a huge number of cases where compatibility of legislation with the human rights act could be an issue once the act comes into force next October. Last night a spokesman for Lord Irvine, who has sat as a judge in seven House of Lords cases since becoming lord chancellor in May 1997, said he would continue to sit. He took the view that the McGonnell case revolved around the particular role of the bailiff of Guernsey in this particular case. But the spokesman said he would not sit in any case concerning legislation he had been involved in, or anywhere the government's interests were concerned. A working party of the influential law reform group Justice, recently called for the lord chancellor to lose the right to sit as a judge. Justice said last night: \"The separation of judicial and political roles is vital to secure the impartiality of the courts and, with it, the integrity of the justice system. This decision is an important vindication of the right to an impartial tribunal.\"",

      "bodyText": "Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, warned yesterday that the fragile Northern Ireland peace process was facing its greatest threat yet as his party mounted an intensive operation in London to halt the growing tide of criticism of republicans over the IRA's failure to disarm. Mr Adams met Tony Blair at his request for more than 75 minutes just before Peter Mandelson unveiled the emergency bill paving the way for the restoration of direct rule on Friday after only 10 weeks of devolution. The Northern Ireland secretary risks the collapse of the Good Friday agreement if he allows David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, to resign as first minister before the critical meeting on Saturday of his party's ruling council. An increasingly exasperated Mr Adams said there was no legal basis for the government to suspend the new institutions over decommissioning. \"In our view the Good Friday agreement is under the greatest threat so far,\" he said. \"That threat doesn't come from Irish republicans.

He joked at taking a sabbatical, although other party leaders have indicated that Sinn Fein would remain on board. \"I don't intend to spend the rest of my life trying to shore up a process that is going to be in perpetual crisis,\" he said. Hours after his intervention, Mr Mandelson underlined the government's growing irritation with the republican movement when he attacked Sinn Fein for being \"lordly and arrogant\" in rejecting pleas for the IRA to disarm. Mr Mandelson called for certainty that disarmament would happen. \"If the war is over, why do arms still need to be retained?\" he said. \"If violence is a thing of the past, why can't weapons of violence be put permanently beyond use?\" He attempted to assuage republican fears by saying that the restoration of direct rule would be a \"pause\" to preserve the position of Mr Trimble and to allow negotiations to continue. \"It is a choice between pause or bust,\" he said. \"I am not going to let the government of Northern Ireland simply collapse into a black hole.\" As he unveiled the special legislation, Mr Mandelson was watched from the Commons gallery by Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun, Sinn Fein's two ministers in the power-sharing executive at Stormont, who were also at the crisis talks in Downing Street.

Mr Hague guaranteed his likely successor the right to determine economic policy in a private letter written shortly before the recently elected Kensington and Chelsea MP's surprise appointment last week. The deal, echoing the Tony Blair-Gordon Brown agreement in opposition six years ago, was thrashed out during weeks of discussions between the pair. Evidence of the agreement emerged yesterday when the Tory leader was forced to admit that his flagship tax-cutting policy is no longer a firm guarantee - merely an \"aspiration\". Party officials were quick to dismiss as a slip the A-word, which got Mr Blair into trouble over NHS spending last month. But Tory MPs were in no doubt that the new shadow chancellor's greater realism was again making its mark in reshaping the party's commitments as the general election campaign looms. Asked about his \"tax guarantee\" at a press conference to harden party policy on drugs, Mr Hague restated his opposition to Labour's \"stealth taxes\" and promised voters that he wanted to cut them: the so-called \"tax guarantee\". But then he diluted his previous stance. \"We offer them a powerful argument that a country that wants to compete in the future has got to bring down the burden of taxation over time - and that is the aspiration expressed in the tax guarantee,\" he said. There would be \"more details of what that means, and we will be more specific\" as the general election approached, the Tory leader added as reporters pressed him to define what exactly his pledge now means. Mr Hague insisted the policy was a guarantee, but said the issue needed to be discussed further with Mr Portillo. \"The guarantee to reduce taxation is a guarantee, but of course there are further details to be added to that, and there is a lot to discuss with the new shadow chancellor and the whole team,\" he said. That was enough to prompt treasury ministers and the Liberal Democrats to denounce as fantasy the Tory policy process, which was \"descending into chaos\" because economic conditions beyond the control of any government could easily render it impossible to fulfill in a parliament.

According to her suit - filed in LA Superior Court, and listing fraud, breach of contract, and violation of rights of publicity among its litigious bones of contention - Universal have repeatedly exploited her father's portrayals of Frankenstein's Monster and The Mummy without paying a dime to the big man's estate and, moreover, have reneged on a previous agreement to cough up their due. The case, currently wading through the US justice system, appears to rest on whether Universal actually used images of Karloff in its licensing materials, or simply generic portraits of large men with bolts through their neck: \"The suit was brought to stop the unsavoury business practices of Universal\", remarked Karloff's attorney Allan Browne, before lumbering into the distance with his arms outstretched in search of children to frighten...</p> <p>Meanwhile, longtime animal-rights activist Pamelyn Ferdin - probably best known for providing the voice of Lucy in Charlie Brown - has managed to avoid (for now) a possible 30 days in clink, after her sentence for possession of an offensive weapon was stayed in LA District Court pending an appeal. The root of the problem was the actress's arrest last year during a protest against a Californian circus, having been seen brandishing a \"bull hook\" - the wooden rod used by elephant trainers - midway through the demonstration. Ferdin claimed, logically enough, that she only had said item on her person to illustrate the barbaric treatment of performing animals; sadly, however, the LAPD failed to make the connection, and promptly nicked her. She's back in court in March...</p>",

The case, currently wading through the US justice system, appears to rest on whether Universal actually used images of Karloff in its licensing materials, or simply generic portraits of large men with bolts through their neck: \"The suit was brought to stop the unsavoury business practices of Universal\", remarked Karloff's attorney Allan Browne, before lumbering into the distance with his arms outstretched in search of children to frighten... Meanwhile, longtime animal-rights activist Pamelyn Ferdin - probably best known for providing the voice of Lucy in Charlie Brown - has managed to avoid (for now) a possible 30 days in clink, after her sentence for possession of an offensive weapon was stayed in LA District Court pending an appeal. The root of the problem was the actress's arrest last year during a protest against a Californian circus, having been seen brandishing a \"bull hook\" - the wooden rod used by elephant trainers - midway through the demonstration. Ferdin claimed, logically enough, that she only had said item on her person to illustrate the barbaric treatment of performing animals; sadly, however, the LAPD failed to make the connection, and promptly nicked her. She's back in court in March...",

It is much more difficult than that. It requires the consent of the IRA army council and a full meeting of volunteers for whom criminality has been a way of life.\" </p> <p>The former prime minister, who said he was still not sure whether the republican movement was committed to disarming even in line with the Good Friday agreement, issued a strong plea to the IRA to disarm because it would stabilise political life in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>\"One of the aspects of wholesale decommissioning is that the IRA disarmed is not an organisation that is sustainable,\" Mr Major said. \"The disarmament of the IRA amounts to the disbandment of the IRA.\" </p> <p> <b> David Trimble </b>, Northern Ireland's first minister, reiterated his insistence that the IRA must begin to disarm this week if Ulster Unionists are to remain in the new power-sharing executive. </p> <p>Speaking in the same debate, the Ulster Unionist leader echoed Mr Major's call for the government to review the early release of prisoners and the reform of the RUC. </p> <p>\"People in Northern Ireland will find it incomprehensible if those deeply wounding changes are proceeded with as if nothing had happened, as if the default by the republicans was something that was going to be glossed over and the continued introduction of radical changes in order to appease them went ahead as if nothing had happened,\" Mr Trimble said. However, the UUP leader held out hope that the present \"difficulty\" - he insisted it was not a crisis - could be overcome. \"It is important that we should retain confidence in our ability to work through this problem and to retain confidence that the hopes that agreement contains will be fully realised,\" he said. </p> <p> <b> Seamus Mallon </b>, the deputy leader of the SDLP, issued a powerful plea to the government not to suspend the Northern Ireland assembly and power-sharing executive. The Northern Ireland deputy first minister said suspension would probably reduce the chances of disarmament. </p> <p>MPs voted 352 to 11, a government majority of 341, to give a second reading to the bill in a division forced by rebel Labour backbenchers.</p>",

It requires the consent of the IRA army council and a full meeting of volunteers for whom criminality has been a way of life.\" The former prime minister, who said he was still not sure whether the republican movement was committed to disarming even in line with the Good Friday agreement, issued a strong plea to the IRA to disarm because it would stabilise political life in Northern Ireland. \"One of the aspects of wholesale decommissioning is that the IRA disarmed is not an organisation that is sustainable,\" Mr Major said. \"The disarmament of the IRA amounts to the disbandment of the IRA.\" David Trimble , Northern Ireland's first minister, reiterated his insistence that the IRA must begin to disarm this week if Ulster Unionists are to remain in the new power-sharing executive. Speaking in the same debate, the Ulster Unionist leader echoed Mr Major's call for the government to review the early release of prisoners and the reform of the RUC. \"People in Northern Ireland will find it incomprehensible if those deeply wounding changes are proceeded with as if nothing had happened, as if the default by the republicans was something that was going to be glossed over and the continued introduction of radical changes in order to appease them went ahead as if nothing had happened,\" Mr Trimble said. However, the UUP leader held out hope that the present \"difficulty\" - he insisted it was not a crisis - could be overcome. \"It is important that we should retain confidence in our ability to work through this problem and to retain confidence that the hopes that agreement contains will be fully realised,\" he said. Seamus Mallon , the deputy leader of the SDLP, issued a powerful plea to the government not to suspend the Northern Ireland assembly and power-sharing executive. The Northern Ireland deputy first minister said suspension would probably reduce the chances of disarmament. MPs voted 352 to 11, a government majority of 341, to give a second reading to the bill in a division forced by rebel Labour backbenchers.",

His last BBC role, from 1977-80, was as deputy managing director, television, when he formulated the BBC's attitude to the still-remote prospect of satellite broadcasting. From 1981 to 1990, he was on the board of London Weekend Television, and, from 1991 to 1994, director of productions of NVC Arts, a company specialising in making video records of opera productions. Scott's Who's Who entry relating to this spell reads as a list of international grand- operatic events. With his swept-back, silvery hair and cosmopolitan aura, he looked the very model of a pre-modern media general. His 1943 marriage to Judy Watson was dissolved in 1960, and the following year he married Patricia AM Smith.

Saro-Wiwa's eldest son, Ken Wiwa, has objected to the creation of a \"burial committee\" by the present leaders of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop). The committee, which had tried to take charge of the reburial of the \"Ogoni martyrs\", is backed by families of some of the other executed men. In a statement from his home in Canada, Ken Wiwa said he was \"deeply offended and insulted\" that Mosop had not consulted his family. Mr Wiwa said his father left a will with specific instructions about his funeral and that the family had its own plans to rebury him on April 24. The dispute flared up after Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, gave permission for the bodies of the nine men buried in anonymous graves in a Port Harcourt cemetery to be returned to their families. Some members of Mosop believe that as Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged as the movement's leader, Mosop should control the funeral arrangements. The Wiwa family has itself been criticised by relatives of the other executed men for asking American pathologists to exhume and identify the remains. Some relatives say they were not consulted, while others say they want compensation from the government, and that the best way to keep attention on the issue is to leave the bodies where they are. Esther Kiobel, widow of Barinem Kiobel, has criticised both sides. She claims the Wiwa family failed to seek her permission to exhume her husband, and accuses Mosop of trying to make political capital from the reburials. \"The different versions of the burial arrangements and the gimmicks, tricks, politicking, manipulations and dehumanisation of some elements in Mosop leave much to be desired,\" she said. \"These people who gave their lives for the survival of the Ogoni people are now being used by some people to gain cheap political fame and for profit.\" But Ken Wiwa insisted that the other families were consulted about the exhumations and that \"the offer was warmly received and accepted\". Saro-Wiwa's relatives asked Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) to identify the hanged Ogonis but the organisation postponed the exhumation after the other families protested. Saro-Wiwa was tried by a military tribunal for the murders of four Ogoni chiefs killed by a mob after they fell out with the Mosop leadership. The tribunal convicted Saro-Wiwa of murder even though there was no evidence that he was present or gave orders for the killings. But the widows of the four murdered chiefs blamed him for creating a climate of intolerance and for the vilification of anyone who disagreed with his strategy.",

      "body": "<b> Fraser Kemp, Labour MP for Houghton and Washington East </b> <br>I'd like to see the voting age reduced to 16. In fact I'm hoping to introduce a 10-minute-rule bill on it soon. At 16 you can work, pay taxes, marry - why shouldn't you vote? And it's interesting to think about what issues younger children might be interested in. I do question and answer sessions in schools, and I'm constantly amazed by how mature and well informed young people are. One of the differences they bring, of course, is their longer perspective on life. So as well as the environment, they ask me about issues like provision of contraception and law and order. <p><b> Helen Rimington, solicitor with the Children's Legal Centre </b><br>There's certainly some evidence that children would be happier. Research shows that they feel alienated from the political process and would enjoy the chance to play a greater role. It's often said that children are \"the future\", but it's important to remember that they're part of the present, too, and that they'd appreciate the chance to have a say on the issues that directly affect them, such as education and the smacking debate.

      "bodyText": "Fraser Kemp, Labour MP for Houghton and Washington East I'd like to see the voting age reduced to 16. In fact I'm hoping to introduce a 10-minute-rule bill on it soon. At 16 you can work, pay taxes, marry - why shouldn't you vote? And it's interesting to think about what issues younger children might be interested in. I do question and answer sessions in schools, and I'm constantly amazed by how mature and well informed young people are. One of the differences they bring, of course, is their longer perspective on life. So as well as the environment, they ask me about issues like provision of contraception and law and order. Helen Rimington, solicitor with the Children's Legal Centre There's certainly some evidence that children would be happier. Research shows that they feel alienated from the political process and would enjoy the chance to play a greater role. It's often said that children are \"the future\", but it's important to remember that they're part of the present, too, and that they'd appreciate the chance to have a say on the issues that directly affect them, such as education and the smacking debate. You might well see a difference in, for example, crime figures if children felt more included in society.

      "body": "<b> 'Who's the odd one out?' Henrietta's story.</b> <p>When I left London with my five-year-old daughter, I was stressed and frustrated, with little time to spend with Ngaio and none for myself. I was sure that the cleaner air and green spaces would be good for us both. And at first it seemed like the right move. I worked from home, and money went further than before. There was no commuting, noise or dirt to sap our energy. On a good day, our new home was close to paradise. But it soon became clear that, for us, there were particular drawbacks. </p> <p>This was a deeply rural area, our little town: one short street of shops; two hours' drive from the nearest large town. As a Londoner who had loved living in black and Irish Harlesden, I missed cultural variety, but my mixed-race daughter missed it more acutely. Her primary school in London had had 60 nationalities on its books. Here, the local population was uniformly white and Ngaio was the only black face in the school. She was very tall for her age, but soon began to pretend to be half her size; she has been chatty, but became inarticulate. She longed for long straight hair and white skin and ankle socks. Ominously, her teachers began to describe her as noisy and attention-seeking, whereas those in London had told me that she was an asset to the class; helpful, honest, confident. </p> <p>We visited the doctor when Ngaio began to suffer regular, severe stomach pains, almost certainly exacerbated by stress. He kicked off our first meeting with \"So how do you pronounce this kind of name anyway?\" After giving my six-year-old daughter a shockingly intrusive examination, he turned to me and said: \"So I suppose she's adopted.\" </p> <p>It took Ngaio three months to admit just how difficult it was at school, eventually telling me on Christmas Eve after wetting the bed for the first time in her life. Any new friend asked to tea was taunted with \"You're going out with a black girl\", resulting in an isolation that was devastating for a sociable child. When I brought the bullying to the school's attention - with examples of her being surrounded and punched, or being the daily butt of apparently harmless jokes such as \"who's the odd one out in our school photo?\" - I was told there was no bullying in the school and that Ngaio 's difficulties were of her own making. What's more, they added, my own \"aggressive political stance\" was \"more appropriate to an inner-city ghetto\". When people say, wistfully, that visiting the country is like stepping back in time, they are not wrong. </p> <p>It didn't take long before I realised that, for all the disadvantages of city life, a multicultural environment would be a much healthier place for my daughter - and indeed, for any child. I was reluctant to uproot her again, but after four years, the pressure on her to be someone she is not had left its mark. She was ashamed of her colour, her size. We moved to Bristol, and within weeks she blossomed: happy at school, lots of friends, teachers who praised her. </p> <p>When I ask her if she thinks moving to the country was a mistake, she says, \"well, not for you\", and she's right. I needed the space and time to take stock, and am a better mother for it. But she thinks it was a mistake for her.

It sat on five acres in a picturesque village in northeastern Connecticut. It had been built in 1912 by an artist with a \"thing\" about light. Almost every room had windows facing north, east, south and west. We fell in love with it the moment we walked through the door; when we found out what it was going for, we almost lost our minds with joy. \"Think what a house this size would cost in San Francisco,\" we said, San Francisco being where we lived at the time. But not for much longer. </p> <p>We'd come around to the idea that it just wasn't the place for bringing up children. You had to be a millionaire to have a house with a garden. You had to have eyes like a hawk when you went to a playground, because of all the paedophiles doing tai chi outside the gates. And the competition for nursery schools was horrendous. And so we said goodbye to our Russian Hill flat, and went off to live the dream. </p> <p>We arrived in the middle of the first February blizzard. About 19 others followed. We would wake up in the morning and look at the freshly fallen snow on the Scotch pines outside and marvel at the quiet. When I looked out the window while doing the dishes, the floor, or the laundry, I would imagine the rolling, empty lawn as it might be in five or 10 years' time, filled with our laughing children and their friends. </p> <p>But at the time we had only one toddler, and I couldn't find a single friend for him, and believe me, I tried. The social scene was, I soon discovered, very much tied up with which church you went to. I would have had every inch of my diary pencilled in, had I become a Mormon, an Episcopalean, or a follower of the Swami Sachidinanda. Left to my own devices, I became pathologically dependent on my favourite television programmes. A friend later told me that she became very concerned for me after she visited me and I spent the whole weekend talking about Renko from Hill Street Blues as if he was a personal friend. I began to get worried myself when I hired a local teenager to do some babysitting. She came into the kitchen just as I was buttering sliced bread: her jaw dropped as she gasped, 'You don't bake your own bread?' </p> <p>No, I didn't, I told her. To myself, I vowed I never would. But no matter how hard I tried to keep my domestic standards low, my life was becoming more traditional every day. I had no life outside my family and home. Because there was nowhere else I could walk without trespassing on someone else's property, I was confined to our own five acres.

Living at the centre of things was a memory since we never went out any more. Walking with the pushchair, I became obsessed that my baby's head was at the level of all the car exhaust pipes. So when we went to Wales on holiday I was feeling restless. The sun shone, the birds sang, wild flowers nodded along the lanes. We put the roof down on the car - no traffic. We wandered on to the mountains behind the house leaving the door unlocked. The baby, always wakeful in London, breathed the fresh air and slept for 12 hours four nights on the trot.

      "bodyText": "'Who's the odd one out?' Henrietta's story. When I left London with my five-year-old daughter, I was stressed and frustrated, with little time to spend with Ngaio and none for myself. I was sure that the cleaner air and green spaces would be good for us both. And at first it seemed like the right move. I worked from home, and money went further than before. There was no commuting, noise or dirt to sap our energy. On a good day, our new home was close to paradise. But it soon became clear that, for us, there were particular drawbacks. This was a deeply rural area, our little town: one short street of shops; two hours' drive from the nearest large town. As a Londoner who had loved living in black and Irish Harlesden, I missed cultural variety, but my mixed-race daughter missed it more acutely. Her primary school in London had had 60 nationalities on its books. Here, the local population was uniformly white and Ngaio was the only black face in the school. She was very tall for her age, but soon began to pretend to be half her size; she has been chatty, but became inarticulate. She longed for long straight hair and white skin and ankle socks. Ominously, her teachers began to describe her as noisy and attention-seeking, whereas those in London had told me that she was an asset to the class; helpful, honest, confident. We visited the doctor when Ngaio began to suffer regular, severe stomach pains, almost certainly exacerbated by stress. He kicked off our first meeting with \"So how do you pronounce this kind of name anyway?\" After giving my six-year-old daughter a shockingly intrusive examination, he turned to me and said: \"So I suppose she's adopted.\" It took Ngaio three months to admit just how difficult it was at school, eventually telling me on Christmas Eve after wetting the bed for the first time in her life. Any new friend asked to tea was taunted with \"You're going out with a black girl\", resulting in an isolation that was devastating for a sociable child. When I brought the bullying to the school's attention - with examples of her being surrounded and punched, or being the daily butt of apparently harmless jokes such as \"who's the odd one out in our school photo?\" - I was told there was no bullying in the school and that Ngaio 's difficulties were of her own making. What's more, they added, my own \"aggressive political stance\" was \"more appropriate to an inner-city ghetto\". When people say, wistfully, that visiting the country is like stepping back in time, they are not wrong. It didn't take long before I realised that, for all the disadvantages of city life, a multicultural environment would be a much healthier place for my daughter - and indeed, for any child.

      "body": "<p>If we are burgled, we go to the police. If we are mugged, we go to the police. If we are threatened, we go to the police, and if we are de-frauded, crashed into, lost. But if we are raped - ah, then, no: we do not automatically go to the police. A great majority of rapes go unreported (as many as nine in 10). It is usually a hidden crime - behind closed doors, in bedrooms or cars or down dark alleys, with the victim as the only witness - and for many women it remains a secret violation: undetected, unpunished, unknown.</p> <p>It is obvious why. We've read the statistics, and know that only 10% of reported cases ever make it to court, and only 24% of those are successful. We've read enough of the discomfiting stories in newspapers, where women are required to disclose intimate details of their past sexual history, for there is still a crude equation in which past promiscuity equals permanent willingness; only the innocent, the unworldly, the virginal and demure are favoured as suitable \"rapees\" (the accused, on the other hand, do not have to reveal their sexual history).</p> <p>For many women it can feel that they, not their attackers, are on trial. We know by now that \"no\" sometimes doesn't mean no, and that in any case some women utter \"no\" after the event, in retrospective shame and revulsion. That stranger-rape is terrifying, but that the newly-named genre, date rape, can slide all the way down the spectrum of brutal crime, into the murky and obscure world of private relationships. We know that \"consent\" is a slippery word, endlessly interpreted, and that his consent can be her refusal.</p> <p>That while yesterday's feminism condemned rape as the ugliest crime of a misogynist world, today's post-feminist world condemns instead the culture of \"victimhood\", where women allow themselves to be helpless, frail and diminished. That sex is a dark and tangled affair full of violence and misunderstanding and double meanings, and that the court is a harsh, brightly-lit, monolithic space where the private becomes glaringly public, and traumas are brutally replayed.</p> <p>And we know that especially with date rape there is very often little or no proof - it is frequently his word against hers, his character against hers. In a recent survey in America, 3% of men said they forced a woman to have sex with them against their will, while 40% of women said they had been thus forced. It's as if we no longer even know what rape means, and a dizzying gulf opens up between the genders. Men think they are having sex and women think they are being violated. Men think they're asking for it and women think that they are saying no.</p> <p>Into this treacherous arena comes the strange story of Lynn Walker, the pharmacist who accused a colleague of raping her, and who on Monday was ordered to pay him a staggering \u00a3400,000 in damages. She now faces financial ruin. Her limited assets (mainly a \u00a370,000 house) are frozen and she is only allowed \u00a3150 a week of her Boots salary to live on. She has been branded a liar, and because the judge ordered her anonymity to be lifted, her face - a pleasant, anxious, bruised-looking face - is plastered across every newspaper.</p> <p>In 1996, Walker had accused Martin Garfoot - a senior pharmacist who worked with her at a branch of Boots in North Shields - of behaving inappropriately towards her. Later, at a more formal meeting with managers, she said he had put his hand up her skirt and called her a \"frigid cow\". In January 1997, after he had been suspended while Boots investigated her claims, she upped the stakes once more, claiming that he had \"almost\" raped her.</p> <p>Boots decided the allegations were not proven, and moved Garfoot (46, married, with two teenage children) to another branch. But Walker kept on with the allegations, and so he sued for libel and slander. In court her accusations escalated: he embarked on a campaign of physical and sexual harassment, he forced his penis into her mouth, his fist up her vagina; he attempted anal sex, he raped her; he made threats which led her to fear for her life.</p> <p>It was not difficult to understand why the jury, made up of eight women and four men, decided that Walker's allegations were false. They heard how she had made no mention of any incident to either her doctor or the police. They also saw CCTV videos showing Walker standing next to Garfoot a week, and a fortnight after the alleged attack, smiling at him and apparently at ease. Would she have gone on staff bowling nights with him, called at his home, signed a get well card, accepted lifts from him, given him a present if her accusations were true?</p> <p>The jurors plainly thought not. But why did they feel the need to ignore the judge's recommendations and order damages that would financially wreck Walker? What on earth was going on, that a woman should make up such a ghastly story about her life, and that a jury made up mainly of women should be so punitive?</p> <p>In court, the jury were told that Lynn Walker was a church-going teetotaller, whose ex-husband had had affairs with other women and had on occasions hit her. She was under pressure at work, and she was depressed.</p> <p>The stereotypical picture that inevitably emerges from these few facts is of a lonely woman, sucked into the nightmarish fantasies that she so graphically recounted in court. We have become familiar with the figure of the victim-fantasist - like Binjamin Wilkomirski, who imagined himself a Holocaust survivor and wrote his fake-memoir Fragments in a rhapsody of imagined and heroic suffering. Or like the young and disturbed women who people Kate Roiphe's influential The Morning After, crying rape to get attention, struggling to get to the centre of their lives in a mutant version of feminism.</p> <p>So, some women, because they are vengeful, maybe, or full of lonely fantasies, lie about being raped. They tell tales; make themselves the star of their own drama; the hero-victim who finds meaning and identity in suffering. But most women turn in the opposite direction, and don't talk about being raped at all. For them the law is a blind alley. They know what all women know: that the intolerable grey area of rape doesn't easily fit into the black-and-white world of law, and that justice can be very rough indeed. How can the rights of the complainant and the defendant be balanced? Over the past decade, legislation has been passed that supposedly makes it easier for women to report rape. It is illegal for a husband to rape his wife (it used to be impossible: to be a wife was to be always-consenting).</p> <p>Police officers are trained to deal sensitively with women who claim to have been raped. Date rapists have been successfully prosecuted. Counsel can no longer automatically cross-examine the rape victim in detail about her past sexual history. And yet at the same time, the number of successful prosecutions has dramatically declined, and attitudes towards rape have become disconcertingly lenient and full of contradictions. There's a split among women themselves: some think that a distinction should be made between rape and \"non-consensual sex'\"(there was I, thinking that rape was non-consensual sex). Some think the law should be altered even more in women's favour and others argue that that is to treat women as feeble and child-like. Some think that all sex is a kind of rape.</p> <p>Post-feminists have become positively light-hearted about it. Fay Weldon announced that she had been raped once but it was no big deal, and she mainly felt rather sorry for the little man who pounced on her in the back of a cab. Germaine Greer was contemptuous about the emotional trauma of rape. Camille Paglia implies that most heterosexual sex is gloriously a kind of no-means-yes rape, a violent and delirious Lawrentian struggle between man and woman, and only priggish, unawakened women do not realise that sex is a war. Kate Roiphe accuses her debilitated colleagues on campus of seeing sexual harassment wherever they turn because they are fearful of their own sexuality. When Jill Craigie disclosed that, decades previously, she had been raped by Arthur Koestler, Frederic Raphael asked her what she had expected of him. When Michael Tyson arrived in Britain he was given a hero's welcome (and after all, goes the refrain, what did that girl think was going to happen when she went back with him to his room?). In these readings, there are rapes that are not rapes; crimes against women which are not really crimes at all. Women really shouldn't be making such a fuss.</p> <p>For many years the legal process in rape cases was itself a form of institutionalised misogyny. Heard the one about the judge who invented the mitigating concept of \"contributory negligence\" because the victim had been hitchhiking back from a party in a short skirt? Remember the judge in the notorious \"Vicarage rape case\" who gave shorter sentences for the rape than for the burglary, because he thought the victim hadn't seemed very traumatised in court when she gave evidence? Remember the rapist who conducted his own defence and interrogated his victim in pornographic detail about her experience for two days in the witness box? Remember the Japanese tourist who spent more than a week giving evidence because each member of the gang who raped her had a separate lawyer? Some of these evils have been dealt with and some haven't, and some can't because of the nature of the offence. Because the peculiar horror and messiness of rape trials is the violation of two kinds of intimacy: what people do with their bodies and, equally crucially, what is going on in their heads while they are doing it.</p> <p>And because sex - the good, the bad and the ugly kind - occur in a territory all its own. Maybe the best image of sexual desire is Shakespeare's portrayal of the young lovers in A Midsummer Night's Dream.</p> <p>They go - as we have gone, haven't we, at some time or another? - into a dark wood, where they go mad, take strange potions, lose their way and their reason, and in the morning, return to the city, bruised and confused by what they have given themselves up to.</p> <p><b>Rough Justice: has Lynn Walker been treated fairly?</b></p> <p><b> Julie Bindell, spokesperson for Justice for Women</b></p> <p>I think the judge needs shooting. This is a disgrace. This man has got half a million pounds, compared to women who get \u00a37,000 max if they are raped. A knock to your reputation is not quite the same as a knock to your safety and sanity, which is the result of a sexual assault for many women.</p> <p>I'm not saying that people should be able to falsely accuse people, but the gesture of this judge and this jury is malicious. It will ruin this woman's life, as well as that of many women who come after her.</p> <p><b> Dylan Jones, editor, GQ magazine</b></p> <p>Although her motives have not been made explicitly clear, I do think that naming this woman sets an appalling precedent. As a women's group said today, it will deter women from coming forward. It's an isolated incident, but the ramifications will be severe, particularly because of many of the positive gains that have been made.</p> <p>GQ often has slightly arch features about the sex war, but this is not something that can be contextualised in this way. I think what's happened to her is appalling, and I can't imagine anyone thinking differently.</p> <p><b> Angela Phillips, author, The Trouble with Boys</b></p> <p>The whole point of the protection afforded to rape victims is to provide anonymity so that they might report something to the police. It's hard to see how that might apply in this case because she didn't report it to the police.</p> <p>If this is just a libel trial, why should she be given protection that nobody else would get in similar circumstances?

There's a backlash claiming that women are just too powerful.</p> <p>I think what this judge did was profoundly misogynistic. What possible public interest can be served by naming this woman? If it's true that she lied, she clearly needs treatment not shaming. Isn't the money enough of a blow? I think it's appalling. How many women are awarded damages when they get raped?</p> <p><b> Sue Lees, professor of women's studies at the university of north London</b></p> <p>I don't necessarily think that the result of this libel case will lead to fewer women reporting rape to the police: this woman didn't report it.</p> <p>As for her anonymity in this case, it's not the same as someone being protected in a criminal trial. One of the reasons women are protected when they report rapes to the police is because we know that the level of intimidation is enormous. So her protection is partly so that she won't be intimidated into not giving evidence. It is obviously very different to reveal a woman's identity in a civil libel case, particularly after the case is over.</p> <p><b> Ian Kelly, operations director, the United Kingdom Men's Movement</b></p> <p>We are delighted. We believe that if a man is acquitted at a rape trial, and a woman is found to be lying, she should get the tariff that the man would have got had he been convicted. The man should also be able to sue for damages.</p> <p>We're in 100% support of the decision to name her. In our view the woman has been properly punished for lying in a court of law. I hope it is a warning to any woman who thinks she's going to pick on some poor guy who she might have had consensual sex with the night before.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If we are burgled, we go to the police. If we are mugged, we go to the police. If we are threatened, we go to the police, and if we are de-frauded, crashed into, lost. But if we are raped - ah, then, no: we do not automatically go to the police. A great majority of rapes go unreported (as many as nine in 10). It is usually a hidden crime - behind closed doors, in bedrooms or cars or down dark alleys, with the victim as the only witness - and for many women it remains a secret violation: undetected, unpunished, unknown. It is obvious why. We've read the statistics, and know that only 10% of reported cases ever make it to court, and only 24% of those are successful. We've read enough of the discomfiting stories in newspapers, where women are required to disclose intimate details of their past sexual history, for there is still a crude equation in which past promiscuity equals permanent willingness; only the innocent, the unworldly, the virginal and demure are favoured as suitable \"rapees\" (the accused, on the other hand, do not have to reveal their sexual history). For many women it can feel that they, not their attackers, are on trial. We know by now that \"no\" sometimes doesn't mean no, and that in any case some women utter \"no\" after the event, in retrospective shame and revulsion. That stranger-rape is terrifying, but that the newly-named genre, date rape, can slide all the way down the spectrum of brutal crime, into the murky and obscure world of private relationships. We know that \"consent\" is a slippery word, endlessly interpreted, and that his consent can be her refusal. That while yesterday's feminism condemned rape as the ugliest crime of a misogynist world, today's post-feminist world condemns instead the culture of \"victimhood\", where women allow themselves to be helpless, frail and diminished. That sex is a dark and tangled affair full of violence and misunderstanding and double meanings, and that the court is a harsh, brightly-lit, monolithic space where the private becomes glaringly public, and traumas are brutally replayed. And we know that especially with date rape there is very often little or no proof - it is frequently his word against hers, his character against hers. In a recent survey in America, 3% of men said they forced a woman to have sex with them against their will, while 40% of women said they had been thus forced. It's as if we no longer even know what rape means, and a dizzying gulf opens up between the genders. Men think they are having sex and women think they are being violated. Men think they're asking for it and women think that they are saying no. Into this treacherous arena comes the strange story of Lynn Walker, the pharmacist who accused a colleague of raping her, and who on Monday was ordered to pay him a staggering \u00a3400,000 in damages. She now faces financial ruin. Her limited assets (mainly a \u00a370,000 house) are frozen and she is only allowed \u00a3150 a week of her Boots salary to live on. She has been branded a liar, and because the judge ordered her anonymity to be lifted, her face - a pleasant, anxious, bruised-looking face - is plastered across every newspaper. In 1996, Walker had accused Martin Garfoot - a senior pharmacist who worked with her at a branch of Boots in North Shields - of behaving inappropriately towards her. Later, at a more formal meeting with managers, she said he had put his hand up her skirt and called her a \"frigid cow\". In January 1997, after he had been suspended while Boots investigated her claims, she upped the stakes once more, claiming that he had \"almost\" raped her. Boots decided the allegations were not proven, and moved Garfoot (46, married, with two teenage children) to another branch. But Walker kept on with the allegations, and so he sued for libel and slander. In court her accusations escalated: he embarked on a campaign of physical and sexual harassment, he forced his penis into her mouth, his fist up her vagina; he attempted anal sex, he raped her; he made threats which led her to fear for her life. It was not difficult to understand why the jury, made up of eight women and four men, decided that Walker's allegations were false. They heard how she had made no mention of any incident to either her doctor or the police. They also saw CCTV videos showing Walker standing next to Garfoot a week, and a fortnight after the alleged attack, smiling at him and apparently at ease. Would she have gone on staff bowling nights with him, called at his home, signed a get well card, accepted lifts from him, given him a present if her accusations were true? The jurors plainly thought not. But why did they feel the need to ignore the judge's recommendations and order damages that would financially wreck Walker? What on earth was going on, that a woman should make up such a ghastly story about her life, and that a jury made up mainly of women should be so punitive? In court, the jury were told that Lynn Walker was a church-going teetotaller, whose ex-husband had had affairs with other women and had on occasions hit her. She was under pressure at work, and she was depressed. The stereotypical picture that inevitably emerges from these few facts is of a lonely woman, sucked into the nightmarish fantasies that she so graphically recounted in court. We have become familiar with the figure of the victim-fantasist - like Binjamin Wilkomirski, who imagined himself a Holocaust survivor and wrote his fake-memoir Fragments in a rhapsody of imagined and heroic suffering. Or like the young and disturbed women who people Kate Roiphe's influential The Morning After, crying rape to get attention, struggling to get to the centre of their lives in a mutant version of feminism. So, some women, because they are vengeful, maybe, or full of lonely fantasies, lie about being raped.

It was a blissful age: old enough to feel you were the master of your body, yet still too young to be disabled by the pain of puberty. When I was eight I could run faster than all the other kids I knew, faster and further and with more sureness of foot. I could out-sprint every rival to the top of any hill. I could spring across stepping stones without wetting my feet. Now my elder son rejoices in his own athletic powers and gives me comfort in the process. When he is still, he is distant and full of doubt. But when he runs he bursts with spirit and delight. Best of all, he reminds me of me.</p> <p>Last week I watched him as he ran across a road, a quiet, residential one that goes right past his school. He dashed away towards his mates, while his younger brother Billy waited beside me, planting goodbye kisses on his baby sister Estelle. Then, everything went into a terrible slow-motion. A car shot into view, bearing down on Jed at the very second he hared beyond the pavement and on to the asphalt. As my hands flew to my face, the driver hit the brakes, missing him by no more than a yard. Jed skipped up the farther kerb and stole a glance in my direction. I yelled: \"Are you, all right? Are you OK?\" He nodded, unconcerned. Then he bolted through the school gates and was gone.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, Billy too was in the school, Estelle was with her minder, and I was sitting alone at home, sobbing with relief. Then I stopped my sobbing and got into some serious self-torment. I imagined making a phone call to Jed's mother: \"Dilys? It's about Jed. He's dead.\" Could it be said better? Maybe, but only if I liked Dilys enough to try. My masochistic reverie continued: first, a vigil at the morgue, organised in shifts because Dilys wouldn't be in the same building as me; then funeral arrangements dominated by me explaining to the undertaker and sundry interested clerics that regardless of what my dead son's mother said about Jed's \"other dad\", this Chris chap was merely a stepdad and, therefore, an imposter, a presumptuous poseur and, of course, a Pillock too. Then there'd be an ugly graveside scene: Dilys insisting that Chris shovelled dirt on to the little coffin at the same time as I did; Chris looking keen; me getting angry; me telling big daughter Gloria and Angie, my wife, to just leave me alone; me swinging a right hook, dispersing Chris's teeth in all directions.</p> <p>I woke up. I stood up. I ate a chocolate biscuit and drank the last two inches of wine from a bottle left open from the night before. Then I walked back to the school, asked permission to see Jed, fished him out of his classroom and sat him down beside me on the cold corridor floor.</p> <p>\"Are you all right?

It just looked different from where I was. Do you understand? Do you understand why I had to come to see you? Do you understand how frightened it made me feel? Do you?\"</p> <p>Silence. His eyes drifted off towards his classroom door.</p> <p>\"I'm here because it made me think about how terrible I'd feel if that car had knocked you down. Do you know how terrible I'd feel?

The new venture, which is to be launched in September and which will cover 6,000 stocks, is the brainchild of OM Gruppen, which owns Sweden's stock exchange, and the American investment house Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. But another contender in the market, Brussels-based Easdaq, warned that the new exchange would increase market fragmentation. Executives from Morgan Stanley and OM argued, however, that their initiative - which is aimed at retail investors and small institutional trades - would add to liquidity by bringing in new business. The demand for cross-border share trading in Europe is being driven by a move away from nationally based investment strategies, developments in technology and the introduction of the single currency. In 1998, London and Frankfurt announced plans to link up to facilitate cross-border trading and six other exchanges - Paris, Madrid, Milan, Zurich, Amsterdam and Brussels - have since agreed to join the alliance; but progress towards a pan-European trading system has been slow. Frustration among institutional investors about the problems of cross-border deals has tempted other organisations to offer similar services. Last year American exchange Nasdaq unveiled plans for a pan-European trading system and a number of other, smaller, organisations are looking to offer cross-border services as well. The OM-Morgan Stanley exchange, which has been named Jiway and will offer settlement and clearing as well as trading, will be 60% owned by the Swedish group and 40% by Morgan Stanley, although the two are \"looking for other partners\", according to Morgan Stanley's managing director, Jerker Johansson. Jiway is expected to be launched two months ahead of Nasdaq's European trading platform, although initially it will only be available in the UK, Germany and Sweden before being rolled out across Europe. The aim is to concentrate on trades up to 50,000 euros. Easdaq director Clive Pedder said the new exchange \"represents further fragmentation\". \"We don't see what value it adds beyond the various pan-European initiatives already under way.\" But Mr Johansson insisted: \"We are creating new liquidity because we are creating new trading flows.\" Morgan Stanley and OM believe the venture will cut the costs of cross-border dealing by up to 50%.",

      "bodyText": "A new threat to the Llanwern steelworks near Newport, south Wales, arose yesterday after a Corus executive warned that the continuing strength of the pound could force a change in production locations. Fokko van Duyne, joint chief executive of the group formed from last year's merger of British Steel and Dutch rival Hoogovens, said Corus would be forced to take steps \"if the pound stays at this level\". Mr van Duyne's comments, in Her Financieele Dagblad, an Amsterdam daily paper, prompted the main UK steel union to demand urgent talks with Corus executives on the future of all British steel plants. Of the four main integrated steel plants - Llanwern, Port Talbot, Redcar and Scunthorpe - Llanwern is seen as the most vulnerable by industry sources, although Corus said Mr van Duyne's remarks \"did not herald any imminent closure\" in the UK and the group was not targeting a specific plant. Llanwern, which employs around 3,000 people, produces 3m tonnes of strip each year - the same as its sister plant in Wales, Port Talbot, which employs about 3,250 and enjoys the additional benefit of a deep water harbour. The cloud over Llanwern's future appeared just hours before the national assembly in Wales debated a vote of no confidence in first secretary Alun Michael. At the time of the Hoogovens-British Steel merger last September, Mr Michael was forced to issue the first emergency statement in the assembly on Llanwern's future. Corus accounts for 3.5% of the Welsh labour force and 2% of Welsh output. Michael Leahy, leader of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, said: \"Both our Welsh plants are among the most productive in the world and their future should be bright. The worrying aspect is the exchange rate, and that's crippling.\" The former British Steel last week reported \u00a3167m pre-tax losses for the half year to October 2 and said the strong pound kept it in the red into the new year - despite a recovery in prices and a stringent review that has cut the workforce by up to 7,000 in the past three years. Corus is likely to shed up to a further 3,000 jobs this year and yesterday axed 60 out of 330 jobs at two Scottish plate works: Dalzell, near Motherwell, and Clydebridge, near Cambuslang, Glasgow. Corus estimates that the rise in the pound, down at DM2.30 in 1996, has cost it \u00a3900m in profits since then at an average DM3. But analysts such as Peter Dupont at Commerzbank say this excludes this year's rise, to as much as DM3.25, and the cost is likely to be more than \u00a31bn. Mr Leahy said the union had been given assurances at the time of the merger that there would be no plant closures, but industry sources suggested these could be triggered if the pound stayed overvalued for the foreseeable future. One option could be to close Llanwern and switch production to Ijmuiden, the ex-Hoogovens plant whose annual output exceeds that of the two Welsh plants combined, at 6.5m tonnes. A nearby long products site is to close, releasing an extra 1m tonne capacity for strip, while a new thin-slab caster will add 1.3m tonnes a year. Mr Dupont cautioned, however, against the costly transfer of production to Holland, arguing that downsizing was much more likely if the pound stayed strong.",

The final report will not appear until September. </p> <p>Worldwide, investment appears to have shaken off the aftermath of the Asian crisis. Cross-border investment totalled $827bn last year, a rise of 25%, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). \"Developing countries rebounded from their 1998 stagnation,\" the report noted. </p> <p>However, developed countries are the destination for nearly three-quarters of international investment. </p> <p>The driving force behind recent increases is cross-border mergers and acquisitions, according to Unctad. Cross-border mergers topped $1.1 trillion in 1999 and 2000 is expected to be another record-breaking year. </p> <p>The organisation said the trend warranted \"careful analysis in terms of their impact on development\".</p> <p><strong> Cable protest dismissed</strong></p> <p>Regulators have dismissed a complaint by BSkyB that cable operators were acting unfairly in the way they bundled television and telephone services. </p> <p>The independent television commission and the office of telecommunications said they found no reason to act after investigating the satellite broadcaster's claims that cable companies were pressuring customers to take TV and telephone services and were selling them at unfair prices.

The report also showed that Britain has replaced the United States as the leading source of outward investment flows. The final report will not appear until September. Worldwide, investment appears to have shaken off the aftermath of the Asian crisis. Cross-border investment totalled $827bn last year, a rise of 25%, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). \"Developing countries rebounded from their 1998 stagnation,\" the report noted. However, developed countries are the destination for nearly three-quarters of international investment. The driving force behind recent increases is cross-border mergers and acquisitions, according to Unctad. Cross-border mergers topped $1.1 trillion in 1999 and 2000 is expected to be another record-breaking year. The organisation said the trend warranted \"careful analysis in terms of their impact on development\". Cable protest dismissed Regulators have dismissed a complaint by BSkyB that cable operators were acting unfairly in the way they bundled television and telephone services. The independent television commission and the office of telecommunications said they found no reason to act after investigating the satellite broadcaster's claims that cable companies were pressuring customers to take TV and telephone services and were selling them at unfair prices. They said cable operators were not refusing to supply the services separately and some customers were taking up only one option. Whitbread to sell 187 pubs Whitbread has confirmed it is to offer for sale the pubs and restaurants business obtained when it acquired Swallow Group. A small number of properties would be retained and converted to Whitbread branded pubs, the company said. The business for sale comprises 187 pubs, 146 managed and 41 tenanted, supported by a head office infrastructure. Located predominantly in the north-east and Yorkshire, the estate includes successful branded concepts such as Bramwells and Barcentro. In the financial year ended September 30, the business, including the retained pubs, generated sales of about \u00a364.4 m with an operating profit of \u00a314.6m.",

Since Britpop, there hasn't been any great upsurge of live bands to justify the number of venues major cities have sustained. Record companies are signing fewer bands than they used to, and are spending money on massive marketing campaigns rather than pushing bands as live acts.

Compared with superclubs, or even Playstation, the idea of seeing a rock band in a small venue (and the accompanying imagery of old men, urine-soaked toilets and feedback-ridden speaker stacks) lacks glamour for young people. \"Small gigs aren't as sexy as they used to be,\" admits Parry. </p> <p>On a business level, pub venues are being damaged by the same corporate impulses behind theme pubs and fast food. The Duchess, for example, is not closing due to a lack of demand for its live music but because the property company that owns it wants to turn it into a shop.

      "body": "<p>In a carriage of a Kent-bound train there's a curious scene unfolding. A young man and woman brace up to each other, and the woman acts out the stabbing of the man, substituting a plastic Coke bottle for a knife. Another person looks on. They repeat the scene several times until they feel they have got it right, oblivious of the commuters around them. Some stare in amazement; others feign indifference. </p> <p>For these young actors, intent upon their impromptu rehearsal, such reactions are nothing new. They know what it is like to be stared at, blatantly ignored, or even stepped over in the street. Suzi, Mel and Stuart are members of a theatre company, Streets Alive, made up entirely of homeless and ex-homeless people. Nineteen-year-old Suzi currently lives in a shelter in south London. </p> <p>A couple of hours later, in the tranquil surroundings of Princess Anne's old school, Benenden, the company's latest play is under way. The audience of 15- and 16-year-olds are obviously gripped by Island of Shadows' story, which tells how a 14-year-old called Lucy is sexually abused by her uncle, thrown out of home by her stepfather, rejected by her father and ends up alone on the streets of London. </p> <p>She is easy prey for the streetwise Poison; he, in turn, introduces her to the violent, unpredictable drug addict Odin who runs a prostitution ring. It is a cautionary tale, an everywoman story. But it is also true, and it belongs entirely to Suzi, Mel and Stuart. They have lived it or know those have lived it - or died it. Turning it into theatre has not been an easy process. \"We had to leave some things out. They were just too painful,\" says Stuart, who spent 10 years on the streets from the age of 14 after a childhood mostly in care. </p> <p>The production is raw and rough. But the play's lack of polish and upfront emotional toughness is part of its power. It feels real - and totally at odds with the well-bred surroundings of Benenden. </p> <p>It is real. Every year over 100,000 young people under the age of 16 run away from home. Some of these will end up on the streets of London and other cities. Yet they are too young to have access to cold-weather shelters and homeless people's hostels that might offer them some degree of protection. Knowing that if they are picked up by the police they will almost certainly be returned home or back into care they are particularly susceptible to those who say they will help them - but too often merely exploit them. </p> <p>The performance comes to an end and everyone claps. But the real drama of the evening is yet to begin. Patrick Young, a former head of drama in a London school and the founder of Streets Alive, steps forward. \"We are asking your help to make Lucy's story have a more positive ending,\" he tells the audience. \"What could she have done to change what happens to her?\" </p> <p>For a moment there is silence. Then hands are raised. One girl hesitantly suggests that Lucy could have tried telling her mother that her uncle was abusing her. Gently Young invites the girl to come up and join the actors and act out the scene. After initial hesitancy she is soon enthusiastically playing the role of Lucy, while Mel acts out Lucy's mother's reaction to the revelation. Mel doesn't make it impossible for the girl playing Lucy but she doesn't make it particularly easy either. At the end of the scene most people in the audience agree that Lucy has made some kind of progress. </p> <p>Soon there is a forest of hands in the air and a succession of girls make suggestions and then act out strategies that might improve Lucy's lot - from calling Childline to lying about her age so she can get a bed in a cold-weather shelter. </p> <p>Streets Alive's technique - in which the audience effectively rewrites the play - is called Forum theatre. It was developed by the radical Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal in the 70s. Forum theatre is widely used by groups working in prisons and the community, and another company, Cardboard Citizens, has also done pioneering work with the homeless using the technique. But Streets Alive is unique in that it is made up entirely of young people talking directly about their experiences to other young people. Those who've been there to those who might go there. </p> <p>At the end of the evening there is a question-and-answer session. The girls are obviously intrigued by the actors' past lives and their involvement with Streets Alive. Mel, Suzi and Stuart talk remarkably freely. \"I've had a very chaotic life and being with this company has transformed it,\" says Mel, who joined the group after participating in a post-show forum at a festival last year. \"I'd given up on myself and gone awol for four years. This makes me face up to myself, every time I'm on stage.\" Suzi puts it even more succinctly: \"It feels like I'm saving myself.\" </p> <p>The area where theatre and therapy meet is always a dodgy one. One person's evening of personal growth can be another's night of boredom in the front stalls. But for all its lack of sophistication as theatre - in the summer the company does larger-scale outdoor pieces for festivals involving drumming and fire - Island of Shadows comes close to fufilling both social and theatrical functions for its young audiences. As Young says: \"Theatre is the form we use because something magical happens in the process of live performance. It involves transformation for the actors and between groups of people who in other circumstances may never come together.\" </p> <p>What it also involves is the transformation of the audience into \"spect-actors\", as Boal calls them. This is a million miles away from the dreary issue-based work of so much theatre in education. </p> <p>But it also has dangers. At a school in south London we visit, it is clear that for some of the audience the play has raised issues that connect directly to their lives. After the performance the cast are generous in talking to individuals, but it is the end of the school day and the children have to go home. I am disturbed that there is no follow-up work from the company, that all they can do for these youngsters is give them num bers for telephone help lines. </p> <p>\"The whole thing has been a vertical learning curve, we've been finding out as we go along,\" says Young. He already tells teachers that the company is happy to return to any school if they feel it would be useful. But he also knows that what the company urgently needs is an education worker, properly structured workshops and support mechanisms not just for its members but also for its audiences. </p> <p>But, of course, these things cost money. Streets Alive has just received 20% of the money it needs after an award last week of \u00a320,000 from the City Parochial Foundation. Young receives no wage, and the whole thing currently operates on performance payments from schools and with the help of volunteers and the in-kind support of organisations such as the Royal National Theatre and the Guardian. Without proper funding the company may not survive in the long term, and yet it is a potentially superb educational tool and also has a crucial social function. As Suzi says: \"Streets Alive has helped more than any rehab.\" </p> <p>Keeping the group together is a daily struggle, and there is a conduct contract that everyone must sign, including Young. \"We have recovering users in the company and our expectations of them are high - but we are also prepared to be generous,\" says Young. \"What we help them do is to like themselves more. Success for us is when someone comes off the streets and does one workshop or stays three months.\" Two former members have moved to the south coast to set up their own company. </p> <p>Back at Benenden the girls gather round, their bright, open faces and squeaky-clean hair a sharp contrast to the slightly bedraggled company. Yet everyone is talking together quite easily. Two worlds have been brought together by an act of theatre. </p> <p>On the train on the way back to London, Mel is in pensive mood: \"We're the people who have gone head on into a brick wall and survived. Maybe I'm supposed to be here for some reason. Maybe the reason is Streets Alive.\"</p> <p> Streets Alive is on 0171-583 0275 and patrickyoung@streetsalive.org.uk.

The performance comes to an end and everyone claps. But the real drama of the evening is yet to begin. Patrick Young, a former head of drama in a London school and the founder of Streets Alive, steps forward. \"We are asking your help to make Lucy's story have a more positive ending,\" he tells the audience. \"What could she have done to change what happens to her?\" For a moment there is silence. Then hands are raised. One girl hesitantly suggests that Lucy could have tried telling her mother that her uncle was abusing her. Gently Young invites the girl to come up and join the actors and act out the scene. After initial hesitancy she is soon enthusiastically playing the role of Lucy, while Mel acts out Lucy's mother's reaction to the revelation. Mel doesn't make it impossible for the girl playing Lucy but she doesn't make it particularly easy either. At the end of the scene most people in the audience agree that Lucy has made some kind of progress. Soon there is a forest of hands in the air and a succession of girls make suggestions and then act out strategies that might improve Lucy's lot - from calling Childline to lying about her age so she can get a bed in a cold-weather shelter. Streets Alive's technique - in which the audience effectively rewrites the play - is called Forum theatre. It was developed by the radical Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal in the 70s. Forum theatre is widely used by groups working in prisons and the community, and another company, Cardboard Citizens, has also done pioneering work with the homeless using the technique. But Streets Alive is unique in that it is made up entirely of young people talking directly about their experiences to other young people. Those who've been there to those who might go there. At the end of the evening there is a question-and-answer session. The girls are obviously intrigued by the actors' past lives and their involvement with Streets Alive. Mel, Suzi and Stuart talk remarkably freely. \"I've had a very chaotic life and being with this company has transformed it,\" says Mel, who joined the group after participating in a post-show forum at a festival last year. \"I'd given up on myself and gone awol for four years. This makes me face up to myself, every time I'm on stage.\" Suzi puts it even more succinctly: \"It feels like I'm saving myself.\" The area where theatre and therapy meet is always a dodgy one. One person's evening of personal growth can be another's night of boredom in the front stalls. But for all its lack of sophistication as theatre - in the summer the company does larger-scale outdoor pieces for festivals involving drumming and fire - Island of Shadows comes close to fufilling both social and theatrical functions for its young audiences. As Young says: \"Theatre is the form we use because something magical happens in the process of live performance. It involves transformation for the actors and between groups of people who in other circumstances may never come together.\" What it also involves is the transformation of the audience into \"spect-actors\", as Boal calls them. This is a million miles away from the dreary issue-based work of so much theatre in education. But it also has dangers. At a school in south London we visit, it is clear that for some of the audience the play has raised issues that connect directly to their lives. After the performance the cast are generous in talking to individuals, but it is the end of the school day and the children have to go home. I am disturbed that there is no follow-up work from the company, that all they can do for these youngsters is give them num bers for telephone help lines. \"The whole thing has been a vertical learning curve, we've been finding out as we go along,\" says Young. He already tells teachers that the company is happy to return to any school if they feel it would be useful. But he also knows that what the company urgently needs is an education worker, properly structured workshops and support mechanisms not just for its members but also for its audiences. But, of course, these things cost money. Streets Alive has just received 20% of the money it needs after an award last week of \u00a320,000 from the City Parochial Foundation. Young receives no wage, and the whole thing currently operates on performance payments from schools and with the help of volunteers and the in-kind support of organisations such as the Royal National Theatre and the Guardian. Without proper funding the company may not survive in the long term, and yet it is a potentially superb educational tool and also has a crucial social function. As Suzi says: \"Streets Alive has helped more than any rehab.\" Keeping the group together is a daily struggle, and there is a conduct contract that everyone must sign, including Young. \"We have recovering users in the company and our expectations of them are high - but we are also prepared to be generous,\" says Young. \"What we help them do is to like themselves more. Success for us is when someone comes off the streets and does one workshop or stays three months.\" Two former members have moved to the south coast to set up their own company. Back at Benenden the girls gather round, their bright, open faces and squeaky-clean hair a sharp contrast to the slightly bedraggled company. Yet everyone is talking together quite easily. Two worlds have been brought together by an act of theatre. On the train on the way back to London, Mel is in pensive mood: \"We're the people who have gone head on into a brick wall and survived. Maybe I'm supposed to be here for some reason. Maybe the reason is Streets Alive.\" Streets Alive is on 0171-583 0275 and patrickyoung@streetsalive.org.uk.

England fans will be encouraged to follow Scotland's example, where self-policing led to the Tartan Army turning their back on violence and becoming among the world's friendliest supporters. </p> <p>With songs such as \"No surrender to the IRA\" dominating some England away matches and the threat of violence concerning locals in the run-up to Euro 2000, Mark Perryman, a leading EMC member, said: \"The only people who can isolate the minority are the fans themselves. We need to separate ourselves from the right-wing No Surrender brigade. </p> <p>\"We need to travel to Euro 2000 as ambassadors not invaders. We have to win the argument that violence has nothing to do with being passionate about England.</p> <p>The trouble is that there is a beered-up, racist, violent fringe that sets the tone at England matches. We have to set a different tone.\" </p> <p>The decision to tackle the negative image of England fans is believed to have come from the EMC, which approached the FA. </p> <p>Adrian Bevington of the FA, who is working on the image makeover, said: \"There's a stereotypical view of an England fan. However, the reality is that majority are genuine football fans who enjoy the travelling and the culture.\" </p> <p>The FA and the EMC both deny the image makeover is linked to England's attempt to host the 2006 World Cup. Fifa's executive is due to decide on the hosts two weeks after the Euro 2000 final on July 19. Bevington said: \"This is not driven by 2006. This is about the reputation of England fans.\" </p> <p>The EMC initially discussed the idea of tackling the image of England fans prior to France 98 but suffered a setback after violence at England matches. Perryman said: \"In my lifetime as an England fan we have always come back from tournaments with a worse reputation. It's going to be a long, slow haul but I'm confident things can change.\"</p>",

In a ground-breaking partnership with the 27,000-strong England Members Club a series of initiatives are to be undertaken to give England fans an image makeover in the hope of ensuring a peaceful European Championship while burying the negative, violent, extreme right-wing stereotype. The FA and EMC are planning a series of goodwill visits by England fans to venues in Belgium and the Netherlands, where the national side will play during Euro 2000. An anti-violence campaign, backed by England's coach Kevin Keegan and some leading players, is also to be launched with the message \"Yes to football, No to violence\" and thousands of posters and car stickers bearing the slogan will be distributed in the run-up to Euro 2000. England fans who purchase tickets for the tournament will be given a guide containing information on restaurants, museums and other cultural attractions in an attempt to encourage them to sample life in the towns and cities they visit. The EMC is to hold regional meetings of supporters so that they can discuss the makeover and how to distance themselves from the minority who cause trouble. Other measures are to be announced in the coming weeks. Officals from the FA and the EMC are anxious to appeal to the \"majority\" of England fans who they claim set out to enjoy a match but sometimes get drawn into violence orchestrated by a well-organised, right-wing minority. Appeals will also be made for self-policing with fans urged to point out and distance themselves from troublemakers. England fans will be encouraged to follow Scotland's example, where self-policing led to the Tartan Army turning their back on violence and becoming among the world's friendliest supporters. With songs such as \"No surrender to the IRA\" dominating some England away matches and the threat of violence concerning locals in the run-up to Euro 2000, Mark Perryman, a leading EMC member, said: \"The only people who can isolate the minority are the fans themselves. We need to separate ourselves from the right-wing No Surrender brigade. \"We need to travel to Euro 2000 as ambassadors not invaders. We have to win the argument that violence has nothing to do with being passionate about England. The trouble is that there is a beered-up, racist, violent fringe that sets the tone at England matches. We have to set a different tone.\" The decision to tackle the negative image of England fans is believed to have come from the EMC, which approached the FA. Adrian Bevington of the FA, who is working on the image makeover, said: \"There's a stereotypical view of an England fan. However, the reality is that majority are genuine football fans who enjoy the travelling and the culture.\" The FA and the EMC both deny the image makeover is linked to England's attempt to host the 2006 World Cup. Fifa's executive is due to decide on the hosts two weeks after the Euro 2000 final on July 19. Bevington said: \"This is not driven by 2006. This is about the reputation of England fans.\" The EMC initially discussed the idea of tackling the image of England fans prior to France 98 but suffered a setback after violence at England matches. Perryman said: \"In my lifetime as an England fan we have always come back from tournaments with a worse reputation. It's going to be a long, slow haul but I'm confident things can change.\"",

      "body": "<p> They must have been easily fooled in the 17th century, you think when you first look at the purportedly eye-fooling art of Cornelius Gijsbrechts. Gijsbrechts made a career of painting trompe l'oeil as court painter to the rulers of Denmark from 1688 to 1672 - the only period of his life when anyone knows anything about him. On the tricksy level you expect of trompe l'oeil - painting intended to deceive - his paintings don't deliver. His still lifes look like painted still lifes, however much you squint. </p> <p>Yet there is something stranger and gloomier going on here than a picture puzzle. As you scrutinise paintings of dead animals hanging on bare walls you begin to think something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Illusionistic painting was used in the 16th and 17th centuries to multiply the world's riches. But Gijsbrechts' court paintings are a claustrophobic dead end: every way you turn you come to a wooden wall. </p> <p>He paints dead game, guns, money bags, letters, combs, in shallow relief on wooden shelves or glass cabinets. He spent a lot of time getting wood right. Gijsbrechts paints the shallow perspectives of his closed spaces so immaculately that you do start to imagine you're looking into a real space. Yet the objects in this space - a lobster, a royal letter whose three-dimensional solidity is belied by squiggles for writing - are obviously not real, as if the objects were less real than their surroundings, the people of the court less real than the architecture that confines them. </p> <p>The more you study the trickery of Gijsbrechts' art, the more you are lured into little lies. No painting is a total illusion. Each one acknowledges its trickery, only to throw in a cunning illusion just when you think you're being respected. His cut-out life-sized painting of an easel is uncanny - however much you clock it as trickery, there's something else to confuse you. Are those holes in the wooden frame real? Oh no... but the shelf is real, right? Sometimes he adds real metal hinges or real wood next to fake. Always the effect is melancholy - all this effort for a lie. </p> <p>Gijsbrechts's masterpiece is a painting of the back of a canvas - the frame, the bare canvas, even a number pinned to it in perfect relief. It's a painting of nothing but the mechanics of painting, a blank facade, behind which Gijsbrechts the mountebank vanished from the Danish court and from history, in 1674 or maybe 1675, never to be heard of again.</p>",

The move may be prompted by a personality clash between colleagues or, say, by the individual's inability to work happily within a team. If the problem can't be solved by moving the worker to another department, by mutual consent, head-shunting becomes an option. </p> <p>In some cases, an employer may actively encourage a member of staff to move - discussing alternative job opportunities and providing good references to speed a move, even using personal contacts to do so. However, sometimes the worker may not even realise he or she is being managed out of a job - a process which can involve a range of techniques, from the gradual erosion of responsibilities and undermining of confidence to the latest phenomenon - head-shunting, when the employer asks a recruitment consultant to find that person another role with another firm. </p> <p>\"Head-shunting is becoming quite common and not always obvious - either to the employee or to the personnel department,\" says Elaine Aarons, head of employment at the London office of Eversheds, a law firm. \"It is, however, a situation open to discrimination claims as the argument that someone just doesn't fit could be influenced by either gender or race.\" </p> <p>Clues that head-shunting is in progress may include unjustified complaints about the work of someone about whom no one has previously complained, or being side-lined as part of departmental or company-wide restructuring. </p> <p>Part of the reason head-shunting is being used more often is that it is more expensive to get rid of staff.
