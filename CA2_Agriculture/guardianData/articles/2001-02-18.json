You've got to create an occasion worthy of a vodka martini and a glamorous party for all those front-row people. \u0095 Maria Grachvogel will be showing at London Fashion Week on 23 February.",

      "body": "<b> Monday, 1.20pm: </b> It's less than 36 hours to Alexander McQueen's spring/summer 2001 show on a bleak September afternoon. I'm standing in the middle of a draught-ridden warehouse down a grubby side street in London SW1. A small army of men are laying cable and erecting plastic seats. This is possibly the most unglamorous location in London. In the centre, there's a huge, illuminated glass chamber with white padded walls blasting 100,000 megawatts of lights. It's like the set for an eerie Hollywood sci-fi movie or a scene from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Tomorrow, this will be Alexander McQueen's catwalk - a stark auditorium where fashion's VIPs will sit alongside the likes of Grace Jones, Gywneth Paltrow, Sharleen Spiteri and co - all of them whirled into a surreal fantasy world with gobsmacking clothes and wild- looking models. The McQueen dream will come alive for just 15 minutes. <p>Preparing a show is a monumental task. McQueen's secret is a vital group of behind-the-scenes experts: producers Sam Gainsbury and Anna Whiting, art director Joseph Bennett, lighting director Dan Landing and DJ John Gosling. They get together with McQueen and Katy England (his muse/stylist/design assistant) four months before the show to clarify the concept. 'Most of us don't usually do fashion ,' explains Landing who usually works on film, video and TV commercials, and is here clutching a large, round 60s film bulb. But McQueen's show is special. 'He looks beyond fashion - he makes it an event.' </p> <p>The catwalk is a glass chamber with surveillance glass for walls. When the lights are on in the capsule, the models inside will see only reflections of themselves. The audience will be voyeurs. </p> <p>The team has a seven-day turnaround at the venue. They arrive at 5am each morning. By the time the show begins, nearly 200 people (carpenters, metal workers, painters, model makers, electricians, wardrobe assistants, dressers, hair and make-up artists) will have been involved. It's an expensive process. This show has cost more than \u00a370,000 and has been funded by American Express, which has supported the designer for the past seven seasons. It's an unlikely partnership - the bad-boy designer and the big corporate credit-card company - but it works. </p> <p> <b> 4pm: </b> Right now, fashion's most innovative showman is looking edgy, sitting in his EC1 studio with England, making final checks to each outfit. The office is mayhem. Amie Witton, McQueen's press officer, is looking pale and strained, finalising backstage passes and seating plans, and fending off endless press enquiries. Scores of skinny 18-year-old girls in bleached-denim drainpipes, scuffed-up stilettos and customised 80s T-shirts run around answering phones, while techno blasts from the stereo. 'Ha ha, can you believe this bloke from Girl About Town wants a ticket?' shouts a tall, blonde cockney girl, temporarily breaking her panic-stricken expression for a good laugh. As if. McQueen's tickets are like gold dust. </p> <p> <b> Tuesday, 2pm: </b> Backstage the mood is tense. It's less than five hours until the show begins. The fashion pack are running around London attending other shows in anticipation of the biggie. This is the show of the week. The one everyone will be talking about. It's the reason foreign press and buyers come to London. Gosling is pumping house music front of stage. Models stalk in one by one to get their hair and make-up done. Whiting's mobile phone is ringing every two minutes. Bennett is making final checks. Today, there are 32 girls in the show. Jade Parfitt, Alec Wek and Jacquetta Wheeler enter. Security is strict. Even the models have to prove who they are before they are let into the warehouse. There's a chart of Polaroids at the entrance and, as they enter, they are ticked off like school pupils. Erin O'Connor and Karen Elson are next in. They sit drinking coffee, smoking, laughing, waiting to be dressed. </p> <p> <b> 3.15pm: </b> Katy England, clad in the skinniest denim hipsters and a cropped T-shirt, is busy unpacking insane creations. There's a dress made entirely from mussels and an ostrich-feather bodice made from polythene bags. McQueen, sporting his usual uniform of jeans, trainers, T-shirt and tattoos, is silent, laying out accessories and checking garments like a six-year-old boy tending a new railway set. He is pensive as he wanders around checking that everything is perfect. Hairdresser Guido and his team are binding models' heads in bandages. Make-up artist Val Garland is painting faces a pallid, creamy shade. 'Is anyone looking at what I am doing?' she scowls at her team, who are busy gossiping with Erin and Alec. </p> <p>There are rows and rows of clothes (feathery concoctions, brocade suits, wooden bodices, sea-shell dresses), trays of accessories, and there's an old man in a dark room with a box of exotic moths, bred specially for the show's finale. He is making sure they don't come alive too soon. There are girls at sewing machines, working quickly, putting finishing touches to garments. Shaun Leane, the avant-garde jewellery designer, is unpacking an elaborate mother-of-pearl corset trimmed with a lethal-looking metal neckpiece that looks like a piece of samurai armour. </p> <p> <b> 6.15pm: </b> Kate Moss waltzes in with a pregnant Sadie Frost and plants a big kiss on Guido's cheek. All the models were meant to be here by 4pm, but this is Kate, and Kate can do anything. 'Right, who's doing Kate?' screams Garland, looking eagerly for a free assistant. Everyone knows everyone else, except the new girls, who sit there daunted, a little scared and clearly bemused by the whole pantomime. Jade has just been fitted into her elaborate eagle dress and had two stuffed birds placed either side of her head. </p> <p> <b> 8pm: </b> The show is an hour late. The audience are sitting staring at reflections of themselves in the glass chamber. Whooosssh - the baseline kicks in. The show begins. First on is Kate Moss, who whirls herself into the capsule shaking her head in a mad frenzy and staring only at her reflection on the walls. Then Jade, with her eagle-head dress, followed by Erin in a heavy shell number. Karen Elson comes off, trips up and nearly impales herself on the spiky Shaun Leane neckpiece. For a split second, everyone stops breathing, before Elson erupts into hysterical laughter. The last model goes on, then the capsule within the chamber shatters and a voluptuous nude lies there as moths flap around the chamber like a scene from Silence of the Lambs. </p> <p> <b> 8.20pm: </b> McQueen is sweating, his heart racing, looking deadly serious and slightly confused. The A-list tumble backstage. 'Kaaaaaaate,' shouts Gywneth Paltrow across the room. 'Daaaaarrrhling, how are you?' The two embrace. Champagne corks pop, TV crews and paparazzi photographers join the scene while McQueen dashes behind a black curtain to do a private interview. The guests will head off to the glittering after party at the Mayfair Club for champagne. Meanwhile, the clothes will be packed and sent back to the studio. Tomorrow, the set will be pulled down and emptied. And the moths will all soon be dead.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The full-bearded, cheerfully stout monk who checked me in for my stay at Rila monastery did not speak much English. I wanted to meet the Igumen, or abbot, whom I hoped could explain a life in monastic seclusion perched on the steep mountainside, and perhaps some of the mysteries of Bulgaria itself. And when I asked about the Igumen, the monk beamed and reassured me: 'Will come later'. </p> <p>For now I was happy that after closing its doors during the Communist era, the monastery was open to foreigners weary from hiking or curious to escape the temporal world for a night or two. An aged key in my hand, I trudged the winding corridors to my guest cell. Inside was a thin mattress barely covering a metal-framed bed. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church allows no curtains, hot water or shower to come between you and God. </p> <p>What Rila lacks in comfort it more than gains in its setting. At daybreak a chorus of sparrows heralded the sun, which in turn brought into glorious focus the soaring pine-carpeted peaks that surround the monastery. </p> <p>More than a thousand years ago, Rila was home to Bulgaria's patron saint, the mystical hermit John Rilski. He shunned the church, living in a cave, an early example of the Bulgarian enigmatic and spiritual tendency. In true medieval fashion, he was considered so holy that Hungarian and Byzantine kings fought wars over his bones; his left hand toured Russia in the sixteenth century as a church fund-raising exercise. </p> <p>But the monastery that followed him became important because without it the Balkans would be different today. Throughout five centuries of Ottoman rule, behind Rila monastery's high stone walls was one of the few places where monks were able to keep alive Christian and Slavic culture. Rila was an island of peace. Around it, say local guides, surged a hostile sea of violent Ottoman despots and their henchmen, alternating rape and pillage with innovative ways to martyr local peasants. </p> <p>While further north, in Transylvania, Count Drakul set about impaling Turks on stakes, Rila's monks trod a quieter path, seeking to copy as many books as possible in a country where written languages other than Turkish were disappearing. They taught poetry and song, and prayed for deliverance. </p> <p>I was not the only one drawn to Rila. A steady trickle of Bulgarians, Greeks and Russians came, though I seemed to be the only one staying. I thought the Igumen would be able to tell me more of what Rila meant to these pilgrims, but a smiling shrug indicated that I wouldn't be seeing him immediately. So I ventured out for breakfast in one of two restaurants behind the monastery. I had a freshly baked loaf steaming in the cold air, salty, feta-like sirene cheese and boz\u00e1, a tepid beige drink apparently made from barley and honey. </p> <p>I had been encouraged to drink it as something very Balkan: 'Europe ends when people begin to drink boz\u00e1,' I was told. I felt very un-Balkan and, thirsty though I was, could not finish it. </p> <p>A group of friendly Polish students camping nearby said that further south, at Rozhen monastery, locals had told them the monks there were linked to the Bulgarian mafia and drove BMWs. But Rila's brethren did not seem like that - those floor- length black habits, beards and contemplative gazes surely were not just for show? </p> <p>I still wanted to know more of the monastic life. After learning that there were now only nine resident monks left - down from 400 before the Communist regime - I was told that only the Igumen could answer further questions. Where was he? 'Soon will come,' said one brother. </p> <p>Out of the building and along a path through dense conifers I passed the well-tended grave of James Bourchier, the Times' s Balkan correspondent for 33 years, who went on regular walks nearby with Tsar Ferdinand, ruler of Bulgaria from 1887 until 1918. Bourchier loved Rila so much he asked to be buried there. </p> <p>The men's rambling must have seemed normal in Bulgaria, where hill walking was declared patriotic in the nineteenth century. Hiking makes sense in a country without much money and Bulgaria has some of Europe's finest highland scenery. </p> <p>I walked another mile up the path to the 'miracle hole', where the hermit Rilski spent his last 20 years. Legend has it that a sinner would be unable to pass through the narrow back exit. The Polish students who were with me slithered lithely through. In fact, it was the well fed, rather than the sinful, that the passageway seemed to discriminate against. I just made it, but probably would not have done after the lunch I was to eat back behind the monastery. Along with what may be the world's best tomatoes and peppers in a shopska salad, there was pileski tridki (Pope's nose, a chicken dish), washed down with Kamenitsa beer, a fine way to slake a hiker's thirst. Afterwards, leaden clouds and my nagging curiosity about Rila's mysterious abbot persuaded me to make a final search for him. </p> <p>First, I took in for the last time the unwelcoming sheer walls that surround the monastery. Venturing through the deep entrance arch, you enter what seems to be another world. Carnivalesque murals cover the central cloister - biblical terror for a pre-cinema age. With all the grotesque detail you could hope for, they vividly explain the Seven Deadly Sins and what awaits in hell (and, with less passion, or precision, heaven) so that even illiterates would know what was at stake in daily life. These frescoes, by the Samokovan Zahari Zogrof, won the classification for the monastery as a World Cultural Heritage Site. </p> <p>The interior of Rila's central church is thickly fragrant with incense and the smell of rich, dark wood. The only sound is the crackle of the slender yellow wax candles. A side chapel holds the heart of Tsar Boris (Ferdinand's son), who refused to hand over Bulgaria's Jews to the Nazis, then died suddenly after a meeting in Berlin. This being the Balkans, poisoning is the only explanation that people will accept. </p> <p>The entire monastery complex is a work<strong> </strong> of art in itself. An outer loop of four-storey, painted wood and stone galleries hold the monks' quarters. They create a colonnaded passage around the open central courtyard, which houses the church, frescoes and a medieval tower with the mountains as a towering solid backdrop. If you decide to spend your life in a remote monastery, why not let it be beautiful? </p> <p>As captivating as the buildings is the monks' collection of illuminated manuscripts and artworks. I spent longest looking at Raphael's cross, a 3ft high wooden carving containing 140 biblical scenes with more than 1,500 human figures, each the height of a fingernail. Brother Raphael laboured a dozen years carving it, losing his sight, but embodying dedication. </p> <p>'But where is the Igumen?' I asked anyone in black. I received the same answers and smiles as before. Disappointed, I set off back to Sofia by car in drizzle on the narrow, winding road down the mountains. I looked back and glimpsed a ghostly, white-robed, silver-haired figure gliding along an upper gallery. It could only be the Igumen. </p> <p>But I had absorbed some of the monks' fatalism now, taken in Bulgaria's spiritual mystique, and I didn't want too many answers. I opted to respect the leader's elusiveness and went on driving.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>Balkan Bulgarian Airlines offers flights from London to Sofia from \u00a3193, including tax. Tours, including negotiations with ecclesiastical authorities, can be arranged through Balkania Travel (Tel: 020 7538 8654). </p> <p>Staying at Rila monastery costs \u00a315 a night. Rila is about two hours' drive from Sofia.</p>",

First, I took in for the last time the unwelcoming sheer walls that surround the monastery. Venturing through the deep entrance arch, you enter what seems to be another world. Carnivalesque murals cover the central cloister - biblical terror for a pre-cinema age. With all the grotesque detail you could hope for, they vividly explain the Seven Deadly Sins and what awaits in hell (and, with less passion, or precision, heaven) so that even illiterates would know what was at stake in daily life. These frescoes, by the Samokovan Zahari Zogrof, won the classification for the monastery as a World Cultural Heritage Site. The interior of Rila's central church is thickly fragrant with incense and the smell of rich, dark wood. The only sound is the crackle of the slender yellow wax candles. A side chapel holds the heart of Tsar Boris (Ferdinand's son), who refused to hand over Bulgaria's Jews to the Nazis, then died suddenly after a meeting in Berlin. This being the Balkans, poisoning is the only explanation that people will accept. The entire monastery complex is a work of art in itself. An outer loop of four-storey, painted wood and stone galleries hold the monks' quarters. They create a colonnaded passage around the open central courtyard, which houses the church, frescoes and a medieval tower with the mountains as a towering solid backdrop. If you decide to spend your life in a remote monastery, why not let it be beautiful? As captivating as the buildings is the monks' collection of illuminated manuscripts and artworks. I spent longest looking at Raphael's cross, a 3ft high wooden carving containing 140 biblical scenes with more than 1,500 human figures, each the height of a fingernail. Brother Raphael laboured a dozen years carving it, losing his sight, but embodying dedication. 'But where is the Igumen?' I asked anyone in black. I received the same answers and smiles as before. Disappointed, I set off back to Sofia by car in drizzle on the narrow, winding road down the mountains. I looked back and glimpsed a ghostly, white-robed, silver-haired figure gliding along an upper gallery. It could only be the Igumen. But I had absorbed some of the monks' fatalism now, taken in Bulgaria's spiritual mystique, and I didn't want too many answers. I opted to respect the leader's elusiveness and went on driving. Getting there Balkan Bulgarian Airlines offers flights from London to Sofia from \u00a3193, including tax. Tours, including negotiations with ecclesiastical authorities, can be arranged through Balkania Travel (Tel: 020 7538 8654). Staying at Rila monastery costs \u00a315 a night. Rila is about two hours' drive from Sofia.",

      "body": "<p>In 1981 I despaired of life at Nottingham Central Library and ran off to Milan. I was 21 and two things urgently beckoned: a vague offer of a job teaching English and an even vaguer hope of a boy called Franco. I'd fallen badly for him while au-pairing in Florence two years earlier. </p> <p>I stepped off the train at the Stazione Centrale. In my bag, a giant bar of Toblerone and a return ticket. Also: Simone de Beauvoir's autobiography, two pairs of knickers and my Charlie lip gloss. I had nowhere to stay and enough lire to survive for two days, maybe three. It was July, late afternoon. The city was empty, sulking under a haze of heat. On the steps of the station, the scattering of slumbering backpackers looked like Michelangelo frescoes, stubbly faces tender in sleep. </p> <p>I spent the first night in a goodish hotel. It swallowed half my money, but I hoped that next morning I could track down the English Woman With The Job Offer. I slept well, washed myself and my other pair of knickers, ate one packet of complimentary breadsticks and bagged everything else - fruit, sewing kit, shoe wipes. I found the English Woman's apartment in a yellow, crumbling Palazzo on the Bohemian edges of the Brera district. I rang the bell. Eventually a boy's smoke-wreathed head appeared at the window and told me Signora Robinson was 'away at the lakes - not expected back for ages - maybe try again in September?' I went to a bar, ordered a glass of water and tried not to cry. </p> <p>That night I chose the cheapest pensione I could find. It was airless, sweaty and throbbed with mosquitoes. The communal WC was at the end of a corridor up and down which hobbled a sinister one-legged man with an eye patch. I listened all night to the relentless pock-pock of his crutches and waited for dawn. </p> <p>I decided to force myself to eat one triangle of Toblerone each hour while I worked out what to do. I wandered through the streets around the Duomo, gazed dizzily up at the vertiginous ceilings of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. Girls rushed past me into the pink neon-lit palace that was Fiorucci, a place of velvet jeans and feather boas. I looked at my shabby, stained dungarees and thought about getting the first train home. </p> <p>Then something extraordinary happened. Something so serendipitous that it seemed straight off the pages of my De Beauvoir. I bumped into a hurrying woman laden with Ferragamo carrier bags. 'La Julie! Madonna, non lo credo! Che fai qui a Milano?' It was the mother of the boy I'd au-paired two years previously. She pushed her Gucci shades up into her honey-streaked hair and demanded to know where I was staying. When I hesitated, she explained that she was off on holiday and her Milan apartment was about to be empty for three weeks. Would I house-sit? Within hours, I was soaking in her huge marble bath, nibbling on Buitoni toasts from her cupboards and prowling reverently around her bedroom, sniffing unguents. </p> <p>Next day I met up with Franco. We sat in the Piazza Cavour and discovered that we had nothing to say to each other. He admitted that he 'sort of' had a girlfriend these days. Relieved, I returned to the safety of my hushed marble apartment, relishing the romance of my aloneness in this big, seething city. </p> <p>That was then. Now, 20 years on, I have a man, three kids, four cats, a mortgage, a dog. I no longer catch trains to unknown cities in search of hazy jobs and hazier boys. </p> <p>On a rainy morning in November, Jonathan and I touch down for a romantic break in Milan. My first glimpse of the city in 20 years is from a taxi as we are whisked through the Alpine downpour to the five-star Hotel Carlton Baglioni in the chic fashion district. Past Emporio Armani, Hugo Boss, Versace and in through the revolving doors to the chintzy gilt reception. </p> <p>Our room, with its heavy pink opulence, looks straight down on the Prada lingerie shop. This is a city where one branch of Prada will not do (ultimately we counted four). Instead of crutches, this time Miu Miu heels clop past my window. </p> <p>There's something magical about leaving England in the drizzly morning and having lunch in another country. It justifies any chilly 6am trip to Heathrow. By one, we're eating squid salad and garlic spaghetti at the quirky, muralled Ristorante Bagutta - here they hatched the Milanese equivalent of the Booker Prize, the Premio Bagutta. We then stroll through the Lombardy cloud to the Piazza del Duomo where I struggle to get my bearings: on which side of the Galleria did I bump into Donatella? Where was that Hellhole Pensione? </p> <p>We walk past Foot Locker, the Rinascente department store and a couple of CD megastores. 'But it used to be so glamorous around here,' I sigh. </p> <p>'It hasn't changed. You were cheaply satisfied then.' </p> <p>I insist we check out Fiorucci. But though the neon pink glow is unchanged, it's just tacky and kitsch now - a place for skinny, moping teenagers, not Mothers of Three who have their eye on Dolce and Gabbana. </p> <p>On the immaculate paved white stones of della Spiga and Montenapoleone, my good humour is suddenly restored. Here, every Italian designer you've ever heard of nestles invitingly in the autumn dusk. Inside, huge granite spaces and perfect girls in black with sleek hair and sleeker senses of humour stand rigidly at your shoulder as you look in the mirror. </p> <p>In Romeo Gigli, a rust velvet dress seems to have no price tag. After groping for an uncool amount of time around the sleeve and neckline, I give up and slink out. Another shop has price tags but no mirrors - mere minimal slivers of glass to offer back a collage version of yourself. </p> <p>We refresh ourselves with drinks in Bar Zucca in the Galleria. After that eked-out coffee in 1981, I take a vengeful pleasure in sipping a Campari (invented in this very bar) and eating olives while watching the world go by. 'There's nothing much to do here really except eat and drink and shop, is there?' I say happily. And shepherd my five carrier bags closer to my legs. </p> <p>Next day, after coffee and brioches in the elegant, eternal Cafe Cova on the Via Gesu, we stroll over to see Mantegna's hyperperspective Dead Christ at the Pinoteca di Brera, where art lovers gaze reverently at the Bellinis and Tintorettos and Caravaggios, and art students from the adjoining school roll joints on the guano-covered steps below. </p> <p>Then it's lunch round the corner at the Santini Bistrot on Via Ancona, where I eat something that now supplants mashed potato as All-Time Favourite Food. A cowpat of runny polenta is topped with two almost-orange fried eggs and then shavings of white truffle. J tells me someone just paid five grand for a truffle the size of a potato. Pounds, not lire. </p> <p>And if the trip is turning into a catalogue of meals, then what better revenge for the girl who previously existed here on Toblerone and hope? In the Sant'Ambroeus tearoom on Corso Matteoti near La Scala, the tiny pastry horns that garnish J's latte would then have fed me for a day. If only, back then, I'd visited Coquetel in the Via Vetere where the fashionable Milanese young pick from free pizza, tortillas and olives along with their margaritas and bloody marys - and Grande Fratello on a giant TV screen. </p> <p>Yes, Milan boasts Leonardo's Last Supper and more galleries and churches than you can count, but it's a modern city, a vortex of industries devoted to meeting the pleasures of now. You don't go to Milan for the Renaissance charm of Florence or the earthenware simplicity of Naples, it's all about wallowing in that Italian ability to beautify life and meet all its sensual possibilities. </p> <p>So, to hell with culture, we're here to shop and eat. We find the extraordinary Osteria dell-Operetta in the Corso di Porta Ticinese by chance. One moment we're in a dark street in the taxiless drizzle, next we're trying a curtained door and suddenly in the middle of the funkiest osteria in town. Here, freshly made pastas come in ice-bucket-sized copper cauldrons, insalata, soppressa and cotoletti swamp giant plates. </p> <p>Admittedly, the sophisticated ambience is sporadically shattered when, without warning, the lights dim and Boney M or Wham! hit the speakers as some blushing (female) customer receives a slice of torta with a sparkling sparkler - and an obligatory dance with the waiter. So many birthdays? Odds against it. I eat my second course in trepidation. </p> <p>And three nights later, back home, kids, cats, dog and family maelstrom also seem a little more manageable. </p> <p>'But, hang on, you never saw the English woman about the job?' says J, ever unwilling to leave a narrative strand untied. </p> <p>'She rang once I was back home in Nottingham and offered me something. I turned her down. I'd only have fallen in love with another Franco and got stuck there forever.' </p> <p>'You might have fallen for a rich Milanese businessman,' he says, 'with groomed hair and one of those handbaggy briefcases. Just think, all that polenta, all those carrier bags.' </p> <p>'But I'd have missed Peter Jones. And mashed potato,' I say loyally (fingers crossed behind my back). </p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>Julie Myerson travelled to Milan with Kirker Holidays (020 7231 3333). A three-night break staying at the five-star Carlton Baglioni costs from \u00a3628 per person, including flights with British Midland and transfers. </p> <p>For further information contact the Italian Tourist Office on 020 7408 1254.</p> <p>\u0095 Julie Myerson's novel 'Laura Blundy' is published in paperback this month by Fourth Estate.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There's enough snow everywhere for lucky British families to enjoy their half-term ski holidays. But it is still a strange high season, with temperatures more spring-like than usual; thankfully colder days are expected across Europe. </p> <p><strong>Andorra:</strong> Sunshine and mild temperatures aren't the best conditions but things looked good for Arcalis (110cm on lower slopes, 170cm higher up), Pal/Arinsal (70/105cm), Pas de la Casa (90/ 120cm) and Soldeu (80/140cm), with almost all runs open. </p> <p><strong>Austria:</strong> St Anton (55/200cm) had all its slopes well-groomed after the World Championships while upmarket Z\u00fcrs (95/175cm) got its share of publicity with Princess Caroline's fall. Niederau (60/100cm) is fully open with well-packed pistes. Kitzb\u00fchel (20/75cm) was hoping for more snow, as were Schladming (50/80cm) and S\u00f6lden (10/50cm). Higher up the \u00d6tztal, Obergurgl (60/160cm) was doing much better. </p> <p><strong>Bulgaria:</strong> Borovets and Pamporovo (both 15/30cm) had some light snowfalls. </p> <p><strong>Canada:</strong> Snow depths are still less than usual. Whistler (165/235cm) and Lake Louise (55/70cm) were sunny. Tremblant (45/85cm) was helped by more snow. </p> <p><strong>France:</strong> All the French resorts are busy with staggered school holidays but the weather has been more like March than February. Val d'Is\u00e8re (63/212cm) was gloomy - weather 'hot', pistes only 'fair' and conditions 'expected to worsen'. Argenti\u00e8re (40/160cm) lower runs have suffered. At Courchevel (20/100cm), M\u00e9ribel (40/ 110cm), Les M\u00e9nuires (25/120cm) and Val Thorens (70/170cm) search out the best snow higher up. In Les Arcs (90/240cm) lower runs were icy and off-piste crusty, which most skiers find difficult. </p> <p><strong>Italy:</strong> Conditions are still remarkably good. In the vast Super Dolomiti area, 460 lifts and 1,220km of piste are up and running well, with lower depths of at least 20cm. The 42km night marathon on cross-country skis around the Sella Ronda is scheduled to start at 6pm on Friday. The Milky Way is doing well with even more snow. Sauze d'Oulx (60/140cm), Sestriere (80/140cm), Claviere (60/140cm) and, just over in France, Montgen\u00e8vre (150/210cm) all report excellent piste skiing and powder off-piste. The only problem has been poor visibility in heavy snowfalls. Further north, Courmayeur (90/300cm), Cervinia (120/200cm) and Cortina (25/200cm) have excellent pistes and powder off them. </p> <p><strong>Norway:</strong> Less cold. Hemsedal (140/210cm) and Geilo (135/ 150cm) have great skiing. Over in Sweden, \u00c5re (45/65cm) is good on higher slopes. </p> <p><strong>Spain:</strong> On the Sierra Nevada (120/300cm), some glorious weather and great skiing. </p> <p><strong>Switzerland:</strong> It was hoped colder weather would slow the loss of snow depth. St Moritz (150/300cm) had very good conditions, as did Saas Fee (98/208cm). Elsewhere skiing was mainly good and sometimes outstanding. Depths were: Anz\u00e8re 40/130cm; Arosa 90/110cm; Champery 20/80cm; Flims/Laax 10/ 200cm; Klosters 15/140cm; Verbier 30/100cm; and Zermatt 55/200cm. </p> <p><strong>US:</strong> In California, Mammoth (210/240cm) was boasting more than 150cms snowfall in three days. In Wyoming, Jackson Hole (137/152cm) was claiming thigh-high powder in the Casper Bowls with more on the way. In Colorado, Winter Park (147/ 160cm) was expecting more flurries, as was Aspen Snowmass (90/120cm), Breckenridge (105/145cm) and Vail (110/ 165cm). All were cold, getting colder. In Vermont, Killington (88/200ccm) and Stowe (95/140cm) reflect the generally chilly but satisfactory skiing throughout. </p> <p><strong>On the nursery slopes:</strong> John McCarthy has been learning to ski in Les Arcs, home of ski evolutif. </p> <p><strong>Best skiing:</strong> Breckenridge, departing 24 February, seven nights Victoria Chalet, flights and transfers, \u00a3639pp. Ski Independence (08705 550555). </p> <p>The AITO directory of ski operators, whose reps help with this report, is available free on 020 8607 9080.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There's enough snow everywhere for lucky British families to enjoy their half-term ski holidays. But it is still a strange high season, with temperatures more spring-like than usual; thankfully colder days are expected across Europe. Andorra: Sunshine and mild temperatures aren't the best conditions but things looked good for Arcalis (110cm on lower slopes, 170cm higher up), Pal/Arinsal (70/105cm), Pas de la Casa (90/ 120cm) and Soldeu (80/140cm), with almost all runs open. Austria: St Anton (55/200cm) had all its slopes well-groomed after the World Championships while upmarket Z\u00fcrs (95/175cm) got its share of publicity with Princess Caroline's fall. Niederau (60/100cm) is fully open with well-packed pistes. Kitzb\u00fchel (20/75cm) was hoping for more snow, as were Schladming (50/80cm) and S\u00f6lden (10/50cm). Higher up the \u00d6tztal, Obergurgl (60/160cm) was doing much better. Bulgaria: Borovets and Pamporovo (both 15/30cm) had some light snowfalls. Canada: Snow depths are still less than usual. Whistler (165/235cm) and Lake Louise (55/70cm) were sunny. Tremblant (45/85cm) was helped by more snow. France: All the French resorts are busy with staggered school holidays but the weather has been more like March than February. Val d'Is\u00e8re (63/212cm) was gloomy - weather 'hot', pistes only 'fair' and conditions 'expected to worsen'. Argenti\u00e8re (40/160cm) lower runs have suffered. At Courchevel (20/100cm), M\u00e9ribel (40/ 110cm), Les M\u00e9nuires (25/120cm) and Val Thorens (70/170cm) search out the best snow higher up. In Les Arcs (90/240cm) lower runs were icy and off-piste crusty, which most skiers find difficult. Italy: Conditions are still remarkably good. In the vast Super Dolomiti area, 460 lifts and 1,220km of piste are up and running well, with lower depths of at least 20cm. The 42km night marathon on cross-country skis around the Sella Ronda is scheduled to start at 6pm on Friday. The Milky Way is doing well with even more snow. Sauze d'Oulx (60/140cm), Sestriere (80/140cm), Claviere (60/140cm) and, just over in France, Montgen\u00e8vre (150/210cm) all report excellent piste skiing and powder off-piste. The only problem has been poor visibility in heavy snowfalls. Further north, Courmayeur (90/300cm), Cervinia (120/200cm) and Cortina (25/200cm) have excellent pistes and powder off them. Norway: Less cold. Hemsedal (140/210cm) and Geilo (135/ 150cm) have great skiing. Over in Sweden, \u00c5re (45/65cm) is good on higher slopes. Spain: On the Sierra Nevada (120/300cm), some glorious weather and great skiing. Switzerland: It was hoped colder weather would slow the loss of snow depth. St Moritz (150/300cm) had very good conditions, as did Saas Fee (98/208cm). Elsewhere skiing was mainly good and sometimes outstanding. Depths were: Anz\u00e8re 40/130cm; Arosa 90/110cm; Champery 20/80cm; Flims/Laax 10/ 200cm; Klosters 15/140cm; Verbier 30/100cm; and Zermatt 55/200cm. US: In California, Mammoth (210/240cm) was boasting more than 150cms snowfall in three days. In Wyoming, Jackson Hole (137/152cm) was claiming thigh-high powder in the Casper Bowls with more on the way. In Colorado, Winter Park (147/ 160cm) was expecting more flurries, as was Aspen Snowmass (90/120cm), Breckenridge (105/145cm) and Vail (110/ 165cm). All were cold, getting colder. In Vermont, Killington (88/200ccm) and Stowe (95/140cm) reflect the generally chilly but satisfactory skiing throughout. On the nursery slopes: John McCarthy has been learning to ski in Les Arcs, home of ski evolutif. Best skiing: Breckenridge, departing 24 February, seven nights Victoria Chalet, flights and transfers, \u00a3639pp. Ski Independence (08705 550555).

I return south, and make a God-awful hash of landing.

Standing out from its youth ful pilots was an international celebrity, St-Exup\u00e9ry, a man who had enthralled the world with pioneering long-distance flights in primitive aircraft, and turned his adventures into successful novels and films. 'St-Ex' was too old for combat flight, and suffered from injuries sustained in a dozen major crashes. But he pulled every known string - all the way to Roosevelt - to get into the war. </p> <p>Back on the ground at Bastia, I made friends with Jo-Jo Alfonsi, a pilot and engineer who has just built himself an aeroplane which was sitting in its hangar waiting for clement weather. Jo-Jo's fascination with flying goes back to the Second World War: 'One night as a child I watched a British night fighter chase a German bomber across the sky, firing as it went.

Corsica's combination of sea and sun and lofty mountains produces everything from wild boar to lobster and wine. The speciality here is an extraordinary cr\u00e8me caramel made from farine de chatignes - the chestnuts that carpet the island. We are lunching with a friend of Jo-Jo's, Fran\u00e7ois Marchisio - Corsica's greatest expert on St-Exup\u00e9ry. When he died, 'St-Ex' had just published the book that was to prove his most famous: today, The Little Prince still sells more than 100,000 copies annually around the world. But he was not destined for a shrine, or even a marked grave. </p> <p>The story of his last day, Fran\u00e7ois tells me, piles mystery on mystery. 'For a start, St-Ex didn't sleep in his bed that night, and no one knows where he went. The next day - amazingly - no one actually saw him take off. And then, he disappeared. The Germans, who kept fanatical records, insist to this day that they didn't shoot down a P-38 on the 31st. St-Ex vanished into thin air.' </p> <p>Jo-Jo and Fran\u00e7ois told me there was an allied war grave nearby. The next morning I visited the neat, wooded grove where 60 Commonwealth servicemen are buried, most of them aircrew. These were young men: their average age is 22. One grave was unidentified, an airman of theRAF, 'Known unto God.' Where the five crew of one plane were buried their gravestones touched, the men shoulder-to-shoulder in death as in life. I walked alone among the graves, reading the poignant inscriptions: 'Tell England we died for her and here we rest content.' 'The only son of...' 'Remembered by your loving wife and baby daughter_' 'Sleep well, darling.' </p> <p>The next day, the sky began to clear. Jo-Jo and I took off an hour before sunset and flew, as St-Ex would have done, straight at the mountains, where a pass miraculously opens and you fly with walls of forested rock seemingly just beyond each wingtip. I had brought with me from England the petals of a dozen red roses. The setting sun was staining the sea red - the sea beneath which many believe St-Ex to lie - as I let fly the petals, in the memory of St-Ex, and of the young Commonwealth airmen who died in Corsica. </p> <p>\u0095 Email Martin Buckley about his round-the-world flight on <a href=\"mailto:mbwinging it@hotmail.com\">mbwinging it@hotmail.com</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'This way to the rental desk, sir,' said the beaming volunteer at Denver airport. Outside, shuttle driver Lamont grabbed my bags: 'Take you right to the car, sir. You know how to get outta town? OK. Head straight for that mountain, take I-70 all the way to Grand Junction.' Welcome to American service. </p> <p>The Alamo rental car park had a seemingly infinite number of four-wheel-drive 'sport utilities'. These are now so popular in the US that you wonder whether the right to own a 4x4 is enshrined in the Constitution. </p> <p>My vehicle was a GMC Jimmy, the 4x4 workhorse of rental fleets. Hired on arrival at the airport this could cost $1,200 (\u00a3800) a week for unlimited mileage. At least half of the price is for insurance, a collision damage waiver (CDW) and a swingeing 23.5 per cent tax. It is these extras that can break the bank. My first American rental cost $150 a week, a seemingly excellent deal until the insurance extras bumped up the total to $600. But US car rental does not have to be expensive if you book in advance from Britain. A deal like that for the Jimmy would have cost around $450 (\u00a3300), less than half the airport price. Getting the right car hire deal is the key to an affordable US skiing holiday. </p> <p>'There are many good reasons for renting a car,' says Jenn Gleckman, Crystal Holidays' western area manager. 'If you don't want to ski all the time it opens up possibilities.' A hire car can take you, for example, to neighbouring resorts that cannot be reached on skis, allowing visitors to take advantage of good price deals on area lift tickets. And a car gives the freedom to make detours en route to the resort. </p> <p> <strong> Essential cover</strong> </p> <p> After a long flight, the choices at the rental desks may be bewildering, but remember that CDW (see above) and Additional Liability Insurance (ALI) are essential. CDW, or Loss Damage Waiver, covers liability for damage to the car. Some UK credit card companies offer worldwide CDW for about \u00a365 a year, but most US rental firms insist that this is linked to the insurance covering your own car at home. The conundrum is that no UK insurance company will touch US motor cover. Thus there is no practical alternative to taking CDW on the hire firm's terms. Make sure, however, that the deal is for full CDW, without an excess. </p> <p>The ALI third party insurance, which is also known as 'top-up' or 'extended insur ance', must be bought in the US to ensure you have the minimum sensible cover of up to $1 million. Beware of deals which offer the 'legal minimum': $100,000 is inadequate in such a litigious country. </p> <p>'Always take both CDW and ALI,' says David Ovendale, Crystal Holidays' US general manager, 'or you could spend the rest of your life working for someone else.' Crystal's representatives lean on clients, for their own good, to take full cover. Cover is usually offered for personal accidents and effects, but these are not essential if you have a good travel policy. Non-inclusive car rentals attract state sales taxes of 5-15 per cent. Colorado's is 13.5 per cent. There may be an additional 10 per cent 'facility user fee', a form of airport tax for cars. This combination adds 23.5 per cent to the bill. But you can avoid paying this by pre-booking from the UK (see below).</p> <p> <strong> On the road</strong> </p> <p> Disorientated, jet-lagged motorists are notoriously accident-prone, especially at high altitudes. Take advantage of the free first-night hotel offered by some hire firms, or pay for a room. This is infinitely preferable to a night drive over an icy 10,500ft pass to a resort 9,000ft up. </p> <p>Petrol (or 'gas') costs about 80p a gallon, a quarter of the UK price. When planning, remember that any US state is the size of a European country. A typical drive from Denver to Vail takes two hours. Telluride or Crested Butte are seven hours from the airport. Automatic transmission is the norm. Cruise control is ideal to rest the right foot and minimise the risk of a speeding ticket. American drivers do not use snow chains, so they are rarely provided. In any event a 4x4 will deal with most conditions. </p> <p>A mobile phone is strongly advised. UK digital 'world' phones have poor US coverage, except around major cities. You can hire a US analogue mobile. Through Alamo this costs about \u00a38.70 a day, plus insurance. Calls cost about \u00a31.30 a minute. </p> <p>Leave enough time at the end of the holi day to agree the final car and phone bills at the airport. It is much easier to pursue any queries from there rather than the UK . </p> <p> <strong> Getting the best deal</strong> </p> <p> Advance booking in the UK can be done directly with US car hire companies or through UK tour operators. Beware of phrases such as 'fully inclusive'. Clarify in detail whether the deal includes full insurance, a facility user fee and sales tax. If you don't ask, you may be in for a shock later. </p> <p>The UK offices of four US hire companies were asked to quote for a week's hire from Denver airport for two drivers, with unlimited mileage and a genuinely fully-inclusive deal with CDW, ALI and all taxes. Quotes were obtained for a compact car and for a medium-sized 4x4 vehicle. </p> <p><strong> Alamo</strong> (0990 99 4000) offered a car at \u00a3200 with a free tank of fuel. A similar 4X4 deal was \u00a3294. </p> <p><strong> Avis </strong> (0870 6060100) had a car at \u00a3225 and a 4x4 at \u00a3304. </p> <p>The best deals from<strong> Budget</strong> ( 0541 565 656) were booked in advance, with the bill paid in Denver in dollars. A car was $364 and a 4x4 was $510. </p> <p><strong> Connect Car Rental</strong> (0800 634 0644) had a car at \u00a3209. No 4x4 was available.Ski racks, which are almost essential, cost about \u00a310 a day. </p> <p>The following were much cheaper and offered excellent pre-paid insurance: </p> <p><strong>Crystal Holidays</strong> (0870 848 7000) offers free rental of a compact car with a resort holiday or package. \u00a3133 buys the seven-day Alamo Gold USA coverage which, in addition to the normal inclusive deals, offers a superior check-in service on arrival, a free tank of fuel, insures three additional drivers and a free ski rack. A 4x4 costs \u00a3115 through Crystal/Alamo plus the \u00a3133 Alamo Gold package, a total of \u00a3248. </p> <p><strong> Thomson </strong> (0870 606 1470) offers a free compact car to parties of two skiers buying a resort package. </p> <p><strong> United Vacations</strong> (0870 606 2222) has a fly-drive package from \u00a3339 per person in the low ski season. Pre-booked all-inclusive insurance costs \u00a3154, with about \u00a360 extra for 4x4 vehicles. </p> <p><strong> United Airlines</strong> offers similar free car deal on its fly-drive holidays in Denver. The holiday prices start at \u00a3345 for two adults together. The Alamo Gold package, discounted to \u00a3139 for seven days, includes full CDW and ALI, a free tank of petrol and covers up to three additional drivers. A 4x4 vehicle costs \u00a3120 a week extra. With Alamo Gold this makes a total of \u00a3259. </p> <p>It is better to buy an all-inclusive car hire deal from a UK tour operator than to use the UK office of a US car rental company. For a week's hire this saves an average of \u00a3110 on a car and \u00a388 on a 4x4. Skiers who are not on a fly-drive or holiday deal will find it cheaper to book an inclusive deal with the UK office of a US car rental firm. Hiring at an American airport is the worst deal of all. </p> <p>All the prices quoted above were obtained on a single day, but they often vary according to supply and demand. Booking through a tour operator means that the firm takes the risk of those fluctuations while the holidaymaker gets a fixed-price bargain. </p> <p>\u0095 Stephen Lee flew to Denver with United Airlines (0870 606 2222) and hired the car from Alamo Car Rental (0990 994000).

      "body": "<p>The political world was simpler in 1882 when W.S. Gilbert wrote, in Iolanthe, that every boy or girl is either 'a little Liberal or else a little Conservative'. They were even simpler back in the fifteenth century when the Papal Bull of 1493 and the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the Christian world into two zones of influence by drawing a line on the map.</p> <p>Nations rise and fall; political parties decline. Yet Gilbert's doctrine loosely applies still, if you substitute Labour for Liberal, though his age, which predated universal suffrage, was innocent of floating voters, focus groups or the 'pebbledash people' identified by William Hague as a key cohort in the electorate.</p> <p>And in Scotland, our political world is undoubtedly growing more complicated because of the two-tier voting system. We, of course, developed a four-party system in the decades before the Scottish Parliament. Now the list has brought the Tories back to parliamentary life and found a place at Holyrood for the leader of the Scottish Socialist Party, Tommy Sheridan, and the Greens.</p> <p>The SSP held its conference earlier this month and reported that it now has more than 2,000 members. It is appealing for \u00a3100,000 to fund its plan to field a candidate in every Scottish Westminster seat; it hopes to gather 100,00 votes. And Sheridan has high hopes for the next Scottish elections in 2003, pointing out that opinion polls give the party six per cent of the second vote, behind the Tories' nine per cent.</p> <p>Sheridan's socialists are not the only ones gnawing at New Labour. Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party is fielding candidates in Peter Mandelson's Hartlepool and elsewhere, but typically Scargill is standing aside from the Socialist Alliance, to which Sheridan's party subscribes. In England, where it was formed in Coventry nine years ago out of the remnants of the old anti- poll tax campaign, it hopes to contest 65 seats. Masterminded by the former Labour member for Coventry South-East, Dave Nellist, it is targeting the constituencies of at least 20 Labour Ministers, including Jack Straw and David Blunkett. In a gesture of unreciprocated generosity, it is yielding Hartlepool and Mandelson to Scargill.</p> <p>So far these are stirrings in the undergrowth. Trying to read the political future is as easy as understanding a Dylan lyric: some scholars, for example, claim that the incomprehensible 'It takes a lot to laugh, it takes a train to cry' contains biblical allusions.</p> <p>More probably, Dylan, like Beckett, preferred ambiguity because it has a greater artistic effect than clarity. But if art is obscure, the future is inscrutable. Not unnaturally, political scientists are very cautious about claims that the Socialist Alliance is opening up a significant new constituency in British politics.</p> <p>Indeed, David Denver, professor of politics at Lancaster University and co-author of standard works on Scottish political behaviour, believes that Sheridan's hopes of a glorious future at Holyrood may be inflated, although he acknowledges the alliance's success in recent council by-elections in England, where its subscribing parties have nine seats - in Coventry, Lewisham, Preston and Burnley.</p> <p>Although Sheridan, a genuine hero of the working class and a man of charm and sincerity, enjoys a significant personal vote, his party, Denver believes, is more likely to secure between 2 and 4 per cent of the vote, although Scotland Decides, an account of the 1999 elections which Denver jointly authored, shows that many who voted for one party in the first-past-vote contest switched when it came to the list.</p> <p>But it would be foolish to write Sheridan off: he has already forced the Executive to retreat on the issue of warrant sales.

      "bodyText": "The political world was simpler in 1882 when W.S. Gilbert wrote, in Iolanthe, that every boy or girl is either 'a little Liberal or else a little Conservative'. They were even simpler back in the fifteenth century when the Papal Bull of 1493 and the Treaty of Tordesillas divided the Christian world into two zones of influence by drawing a line on the map. Nations rise and fall; political parties decline. Yet Gilbert's doctrine loosely applies still, if you substitute Labour for Liberal, though his age, which predated universal suffrage, was innocent of floating voters, focus groups or the 'pebbledash people' identified by William Hague as a key cohort in the electorate. And in Scotland, our political world is undoubtedly growing more complicated because of the two-tier voting system. We, of course, developed a four-party system in the decades before the Scottish Parliament. Now the list has brought the Tories back to parliamentary life and found a place at Holyrood for the leader of the Scottish Socialist Party, Tommy Sheridan, and the Greens. The SSP held its conference earlier this month and reported that it now has more than 2,000 members. It is appealing for \u00a3100,000 to fund its plan to field a candidate in every Scottish Westminster seat; it hopes to gather 100,00 votes. And Sheridan has high hopes for the next Scottish elections in 2003, pointing out that opinion polls give the party six per cent of the second vote, behind the Tories' nine per cent. Sheridan's socialists are not the only ones gnawing at New Labour. Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party is fielding candidates in Peter Mandelson's Hartlepool and elsewhere, but typically Scargill is standing aside from the Socialist Alliance, to which Sheridan's party subscribes. In England, where it was formed in Coventry nine years ago out of the remnants of the old anti- poll tax campaign, it hopes to contest 65 seats. Masterminded by the former Labour member for Coventry South-East, Dave Nellist, it is targeting the constituencies of at least 20 Labour Ministers, including Jack Straw and David Blunkett. In a gesture of unreciprocated generosity, it is yielding Hartlepool and Mandelson to Scargill. So far these are stirrings in the undergrowth. Trying to read the political future is as easy as understanding a Dylan lyric: some scholars, for example, claim that the incomprehensible 'It takes a lot to laugh, it takes a train to cry' contains biblical allusions. More probably, Dylan, like Beckett, preferred ambiguity because it has a greater artistic effect than clarity. But if art is obscure, the future is inscrutable. Not unnaturally, political scientists are very cautious about claims that the Socialist Alliance is opening up a significant new constituency in British politics. Indeed, David Denver, professor of politics at Lancaster University and co-author of standard works on Scottish political behaviour, believes that Sheridan's hopes of a glorious future at Holyrood may be inflated, although he acknowledges the alliance's success in recent council by-elections in England, where its subscribing parties have nine seats - in Coventry, Lewisham, Preston and Burnley. Although Sheridan, a genuine hero of the working class and a man of charm and sincerity, enjoys a significant personal vote, his party, Denver believes, is more likely to secure between 2 and 4 per cent of the vote, although Scotland Decides, an account of the 1999 elections which Denver jointly authored, shows that many who voted for one party in the first-past-vote contest switched when it came to the list. But it would be foolish to write Sheridan off: he has already forced the Executive to retreat on the issue of warrant sales. Many Labour members must in spirit have been with Sheridan, George Galloway and the others who were arrested at Faslane on Monday. Most, after all, privately believe in nuclear disarmament. With a fair wind, he will surely become a substantial player in Scotland's political future.",

In his most honest appraisal yet of the mood of the nation, the Prime Minister will use his keynote speech at the party's spring conference in Glasgow to say that cynicism in the electorate and a growing belief that 'all politicians are the same' is the most dangerous threat to his dreams of a second term. He will accuse the Conservatives of encouraging the negative mood so that they have a better chance of winning. Blair will say that the British public have a duty to vote, and that 'a decision to stay at home is a decision to vote Tory'. A Labour Party spokesman said that it was a 'civic duty to take part in democracy' but ruled out any moves to compulsory voting. The party has identified 60 target seats where the Labour party could lose to the Tories or the Liberal Democrats if their core vote does not turn out. Blair will say that it is 'choice not chance' that the Government has been able to bring in reforms and that the British public should understand that their vote counts. He will also re-iterate his commitment to tackling crime and is expected to launch new initiatives aimed attackling 'a hardcore of offenders'. He will also insist that the hard won reputation for economic competence must not be thrown away by a pre-election tax cut give away.

The Prime Minister hopes that the blizzard of announcements at the conference yesterday from John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, David Blunkett, the Education Secretary, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, and Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, will convince voters that Labour still has the will to achieve more in a second term. Party officials admitted that the conference had never seen such a parade of senior Ministers. The Cabinet Ministers peppered their speeches with election pledges on better schools, an improved health service and more help for crime victims. At the end of his speech. Prescott returned to the rostrum and shouted: 'Are you ready? Let's go to it.' The Deputy Prime Minister also revealed that the age when older people can receive concessionary bus passes will be equalised at the age of 60 for men and women. The effective reduction in the qualification age for men from 65 to 60 will mean that 1.5 million more people can take advantage of the scheme. The move comes as the Government backs down over a legal battle with the European Union which has said that having different ages for qualification could be discriminatory and therefore illegal. During his speech Milburn promised more money for cancer care and targets for bringing the mortality rate for underprivileged children up to the average for better off families. The Health Secretary also said that doctors who agreed to give up private work for the first seven years of their career would be paid a bonus and that the health service still needed to go through a revolution if the public were to have faith in it. 'Despite the efforts of staff, the NHS is still too much like the world of the Forties, with too many patients queueing for too long for treatment, with too many staff shortages, too few doctors and nurses, staff too often run off their feet,' he added.

      "body": "<p>The two security guards thought they had died and gone to heaven. Their task of guarding a travel agency on an industrial estate in Hull was probably the most exciting nightshift they had had for a long time. </p> <p>No constant patrols around the perimeter fence or scanning TV security screens. While the travel agency staff tried to busy themselves doing administrative work, the two men skied a few slopes on the ski simulator. When they tired of that, they moved on to the imported Lincoln Continental car fitted with a simulator to practice driving on the right hand side of the road in a left-hand- drive car. When the photographer came to take some pictures, they took off their jackets and posed as customers scanning the late availability cards. </p> <p>The rest of us were finding it a little harder to stay awake. I had come to Hull to take part in the 24-hour trial opening of one of Holiday Hypermarket's travel superstores and I had believed the hype. I had expected to see factory and care home workers popping in on their way to their nightshift to book their next holiday in the sun or clubbers returning from a night on the town to check availability for their next holiday to Ibiza. But the posters advertising the 24-hour opening 'Due to Demand' on the agency walls did not quite match the reality. </p> <p>By 11.30pm the number of customers had dwindled to two. A couple came in to buy a cruise but couldn't book it because the cruise company's booking system had shut down for the night. From midnight to 6am not a soul walked through the door. The only living thing that tried to get in was a cat. </p> <p>Flyers advertising the 24-hour opening had been sent round local factories and care homes and even nightclubs. An advert had also been placed in the local paper. Research had shown that the 24-hour Asda next door was particularly busy on Thursday and Friday evenings.

      "bodyText": "The two security guards thought they had died and gone to heaven. Their task of guarding a travel agency on an industrial estate in Hull was probably the most exciting nightshift they had had for a long time. No constant patrols around the perimeter fence or scanning TV security screens. While the travel agency staff tried to busy themselves doing administrative work, the two men skied a few slopes on the ski simulator. When they tired of that, they moved on to the imported Lincoln Continental car fitted with a simulator to practice driving on the right hand side of the road in a left-hand- drive car. When the photographer came to take some pictures, they took off their jackets and posed as customers scanning the late availability cards. The rest of us were finding it a little harder to stay awake. I had come to Hull to take part in the 24-hour trial opening of one of Holiday Hypermarket's travel superstores and I had believed the hype. I had expected to see factory and care home workers popping in on their way to their nightshift to book their next holiday in the sun or clubbers returning from a night on the town to check availability for their next holiday to Ibiza. But the posters advertising the 24-hour opening 'Due to Demand' on the agency walls did not quite match the reality. By 11.30pm the number of customers had dwindled to two. A couple came in to buy a cruise but couldn't book it because the cruise company's booking system had shut down for the night. From midnight to 6am not a soul walked through the door. The only living thing that tried to get in was a cat. Flyers advertising the 24-hour opening had been sent round local factories and care homes and even nightclubs. An advert had also been placed in the local paper. Research had shown that the 24-hour Asda next door was particularly busy on Thursday and Friday evenings. But while I can see the logic of buying a pint of milk and loaf of bread on the way home from a nightshift, it's hard to imagine someone having the urge to book their holiday. The eight staff who had volunteered to take part in the 24-hour trial were in remarkably good spirits - buoyed by regular doses of Red Bull and Pro Plus.

George W. Bush has recently left this nirvana for the swampier climes of Washington DC, but he was never a true Austinite. No one I met had even laid eyes on the former Texas Governor, but everyone, and I mean everyone, had a Willie anecdote. </p> <p>From the bedraggled-looking biker in the Horseshoe Lounge who offered me free samples of his tamales and told me he'd seen Willie play 50 times in 20 years, to the has-been football coach lounging in the Broken Spoke with his posed picture in his wallet, everyone loves Willie. And it was the great man himself who turned Austin into the self-proclaimed 'Live Music Capital of the World' when he relocated here in the early Seventies, tired of the Nashville nonsense and intent on going his own musical way. </p> <p>Ever since, musicians keen to do their finest work without commercial considerations have gathered and now play nightly in more than 100 live music venues. Fans of all musical genres can slake their thirst for grunge, heavy metal, thrash, jazz, Tejano and any combination besides. </p> <p>But for lovers of pure country music, there is no better place. You won't find ersatz cow boys here, no 'hat' acts, and definitely no line dancing. What you will find are passionate musicians intent on keeping the roots of real country intact and giving you a good time into the bargain. </p> <p>For an Austin novice there is no finer place to start than Tuesday night at Jovita's Cantina, a small Mexican restaurant in south Austin. Order a plate of enchiladas and an ice-cold margarita and sit back and soak up the yodelling genius of Don Walser. </p> <p>No matter how miserable you are, the astonishing vocals of this 66-year-old ex-Texas state employee will have you in raptures. Nicknamed the 'abdominal showman' by fellow local legend Cornell Hurd, this giant of a man will wow you with old country classics as well as his own compositions. Small wonder he was recently awarded a National Heritage Award by the US government. </p> <p>If you're spending any time in Austin, you will want to master the Texas two-step, a dance practised by everyone from conservative elderly couples to hard-drinking lesbians. It looks magnificent but is surprisingly easy, and you won't find any shortage of volunteers to teach you. For women it's a simple right-right-left step and the man leads. But as my new west Texan friend Amy, the self-proclaimed rodeo bitch from hell, warns: 'Every cowboy is different.' There are variations, but drink enough long-neck Pearl or Lone Star beer and you'll be flying across the floor of the Broken Spoke in no time. </p> <p>The Spoke is an Austin classic, a dance hall and diner that attracts top local talent and is packed at weekends. You'll find plenty of pickups in the parking lot and plenty of Stetsons and Wranglers inside. The Wednesday night I was in town, Kinky Friedman was joined by Billy Joe Shaver, Joe Ely and Kimmie Rhodes on stage for a heavenly marriage of country talent. If you do want to dance, this is the best place in Austin. </p> <p>If you make it to Thursday and heartbreak king Dale Watson is in town then there is only one place to be come 10pm: Ginny's Little Longhorn. The 'honkiest tonkiest beerjoint' of Watson's song, Ginny's is a tiny shack in north Austin where you can't even see the band because so many people cram in and on to the tiny dance floor. If an <strong> </strong> innocent looking 82-year-old man asks you to dance, don't do it. He will press you so close you will think you are never going to breathe again. And mind your language, as a sign warns: 'No fussin', no cussin', no hasslin', no wrasslin'.' Otherwise, stay upright, knock back the beer and Watson and his Lone Stars will give you an evening of hardcore honkytonk you will never forget. </p> <p>Amazingly, music of this quality is on offer every night and you can fit three or four gigs into an evening if you plan well. Another venue you won't want to miss is the Continental Club, where a handful of different acts play each evening. Top class local talent such as blues-tinged Toni Price play free happy-hour gigs from 6.30pm and if you stay you won't have to pay the cover charge for the rest of the night's entertainment. </p> <p>In the unlikely event that you ever tire of Austin there are two places country music lovers may want to venture. </p> <p>The first is Luckenbach, Texas, made famous by the Willie Nelson/Waylon Jennings song of 1970. Buy a map because there are no signs to this hamlet that consists of a beer joint-cum-post office and a dance hall: fans have stolen them all. </p> <p>The other is the historic town of Gruene (pronounced Green), where stands the oldest dance hall in Texas. On your way out to these places in the Texas hill country, you would be advised to stop off at the Salt Lick, 12 miles from Austin. Here you will find what locals consider to be the finest barbecued meat in these parts, and barbecue is a religion rather than a hobby in Texas.

      "body": "<p><strong> Twisting</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> tornado chasers, who would claim that the film Twister is unrealistic, spend hours on buses each day in Kansas and other Midwest states in pursuit of meteorological excitement, accompanied by weather satellite systems, designed to help them get close to tornado action. </p> <p><strong> Where: </strong> Tornado Alley - around Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa as well as Kansas. </p> <p><strong> When: </strong> May and June. </p> <p><strong> How: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.tempesttours.com\">Tempest Tours</a>, (001 817 274 9313) has several trips this year from $1,900 (\u00a31,300). Prices do not include flights from Britain. </p> <p><strong> Eclipse</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> Africa is a long way to go to experience a total eclipse of the sun, but in the next 18 months the continent will see two of them. Unlike Britain in 1999, when the eclipse was clouded by lack of visibility, this is not likely to be a problem. This year's eclipse takes place at the height of the dry season when cloud cover is likely to minimal. It will undoubtedly be an awe-inspiring occasion. Eclipsomaniacs would argue otherwise, but it is possibly a bit sad to visit a continent just for an experience that lasts between three minutes (Mozambique) and four minutes 34 seconds (Angola). However, combining it with other holiday options, including safaris, offers an unrivalled chance to see African wildlife get confused by an unexpected nightfall. (After Africa, the next solar eclipse will be in the Antarctic in 2003 and Turkey and Libya in 2006.) </p> <p><strong> Where: </strong> Africa - parts of Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Madagascar in 2001. Angola, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique (and the coast of South Australia) in 2002. </p> <p><strong> When: </strong> 21 June 2001 and 2 December 2002 (although in 2002 totality might be impaired as the eclipse takes place in the rainy season). </p> <p><strong> How: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.sunvil.co.uk/africa/eclipse/eclipse.htm\">Sunvil</a> (020 8232 9777) has limited availability on a variety of eclipse safaris. Prices from \u00a32,589.</p> <p><strong> Northern lights</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> first the science bit. The Northern Lights - properly called the Aurora Borealis - occur when the earth's magnetic fields interact with solar storms. Meaning that, on a clear night near the Arctic Circle in winter, there is a spectacular light show with pulsating patches of green, yellow, blue (and occasionally red) light. In the winter of 2001/2002 the sun will be at the peak of its 11-year cycle which means that that the Northern Lights will be at their strongest. </p> <p><strong> Where: </strong> Northern Scandinavia, Iceland, North Canada and Alaska. </p> <p><strong> When: </strong> October to April. </p> <p><strong> How: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.arctic-experience.co.uk\">Arctic Experience</a> (01737 214214) has a four-day trip to Lake Myvatn in Iceland from \u00a3495. </p> <p><strong> Flamingos</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> What: </strong> the supermodel of the animal kingdom, the flamingo is an exquisitely pointless creature, whose life is largely devoted to feeding on the algae that gives it its distinctive colouring. It is the ultimate fashion victim - its spindly legs and non aero-dynamic body make it enormously attractive to predators.

      "bodyText": "Twisting What: tornado chasers, who would claim that the film Twister is unrealistic, spend hours on buses each day in Kansas and other Midwest states in pursuit of meteorological excitement, accompanied by weather satellite systems, designed to help them get close to tornado action. Where: Tornado Alley - around Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa as well as Kansas. When: May and June. How: Tempest Tours, (001 817 274 9313) has several trips this year from $1,900 (\u00a31,300). Prices do not include flights from Britain. Eclipse What: Africa is a long way to go to experience a total eclipse of the sun, but in the next 18 months the continent will see two of them. Unlike Britain in 1999, when the eclipse was clouded by lack of visibility, this is not likely to be a problem. This year's eclipse takes place at the height of the dry season when cloud cover is likely to minimal. It will undoubtedly be an awe-inspiring occasion. Eclipsomaniacs would argue otherwise, but it is possibly a bit sad to visit a continent just for an experience that lasts between three minutes (Mozambique) and four minutes 34 seconds (Angola). However, combining it with other holiday options, including safaris, offers an unrivalled chance to see African wildlife get confused by an unexpected nightfall. (After Africa, the next solar eclipse will be in the Antarctic in 2003 and Turkey and Libya in 2006.) Where: Africa - parts of Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Madagascar in 2001. Angola, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique (and the coast of South Australia) in 2002. When: 21 June 2001 and 2 December 2002 (although in 2002 totality might be impaired as the eclipse takes place in the rainy season). How: Sunvil (020 8232 9777) has limited availability on a variety of eclipse safaris. Prices from \u00a32,589. Northern lights What: first the science bit. The Northern Lights - properly called the Aurora Borealis - occur when the earth's magnetic fields interact with solar storms. Meaning that, on a clear night near the Arctic Circle in winter, there is a spectacular light show with pulsating patches of green, yellow, blue (and occasionally red) light. In the winter of 2001/2002 the sun will be at the peak of its 11-year cycle which means that that the Northern Lights will be at their strongest. Where: Northern Scandinavia, Iceland, North Canada and Alaska. When: October to April. How: Arctic Experience (01737 214214) has a four-day trip to Lake Myvatn in Iceland from \u00a3495. Flamingos What: the supermodel of the animal kingdom, the flamingo is an exquisitely pointless creature, whose life is largely devoted to feeding on the algae that gives it its distinctive colouring. It is the ultimate fashion victim - its spindly legs and non aero-dynamic body make it enormously attractive to predators. As a result, flamingos are forced to live in vast packs up to a million strong (looking not unlike a giant pink duvet); but create one of the most beautiful spectacles in the world at the same time. Where: the Great Rift Valley in Africa, particularly Lakes Nakuru, Elmenteita, Bogoria and Natron. When: all year. How: Limosa Holidays (01263 578143) visits Lake Nakuru as part of its 15-day birdwatching safari The African Experience between 20 October and 3November 2001, from \u00a32,895. Wildebeest What: making the London rush hour look like a cakewalk, each year millions of animals trek through the Serengeti and Masai Mara national parks. The stars are the million-odd wildebeest that arrive at the banks of the Grumeti River in July and August, plucking up courage to plunge through the crocodile-infested water to reach the pasture lands on the other side. Not for the fainthearted; lions and hyenas are also lying in wait to attack the wildebeest and zebras as they try to cross. Where: Tanzania and Kenya. When: July and August. How: Cox and Kings (01233 211401) has an eight-day safari to the Serengeti from \u00a32,855. Namaqualand flowers What: each year the semi-desert of Namaqualand, 400 miles north of Cape Town, is transformed into a multicoloured carpet of wild flowers containing more than 4,000 different species, including Michaelmas daisies, aloes, gladioli and lilies. Where: South Africa. When: late August/early September. How: Rainbow Tours (020 7226 1004) offers a four-day flower tour from \u00a31,095. Polar bears What: while waiting for Hudson Bay to freeze over, the world's largest posse of polar bears - around a thousand - head to the remote Canadian town of Churchill to forage for food and generally make a spectacle of themselves - even though the town instigates a polar bear prison for those it catches (the bears are removed to a more suitable environment by helicopter). Churchill is also the ideal base to take trips in reinforced vehicles to see bears in the tundra (polar bears are not as mellow as a Fox's Glacier Mints advert would suggest). Where: Canada. When: late October and November How: Discover the World (01737 218802) has a variety of trips including the nine-day trip Kingdom of the Ice Bear and the five-day Polar Bear Weekend (both \u00a31,995). Monarch butterflies What: each winter, the Monarch butterfly flies south from the more northern parts of North America and congregates just below San Francisco to see in the winter in style. They shelter in their thousands in the Monterey pines and Eucalyptus trees - and spread their orange and black wings each morning to find food. The holiday of a lifetime; particularly for the butterflies (since their life span doesn't permit them to make a return trip). Where: Monterey, California. When: October to February. How: Discover the World (01737 218802) has an eight-day trip to Monterey Foray from \u00a31,595. Bear fest What: it depends whether you prefer fish to bears, but twice a year, in rivers north of Vancouver, native bears (mostly black with a few brown ones) are guaranteed to be at the water's edge in large numbers when thousands of spawning salmon head upriver, presenting easy pickings for bear and photographer alike. Where: Alaska. When: May and especially July to mid- August. How: North American Highways (01902 851138) has an 11-day trip, Totem, Bears, Whales and Glaciers in Southeast Alaska, which includes a three-night stay near the Anan Bear Sanctuary on the Stikine River from \u00a32,200. Icebergs and penguins What: white on white makes for some of the most stunning images in the natural world, and nowhere more so than Antarctica. Prime sights include the four million penguins on Macquarie Island, as well as the largest concentration of whales in the world; plus icefloes and icebergs galore. Where: Antarctica. When: Between November and March (heavy ice makes it impossible to navigate the Antarctic outside these dates). How: Wildlife Worldwide (020 8667 9158) has a 29-day cruise abroad the Kapitan Khlebnikov from \u00a39,045. Manta rays What: manta rays are friendly, fascinating but not exactly beautiful. However, even a fish that is clearly modelled on a 1970s-style spaceship has pride. They turn up in the Ari Atoll in the Maldives each year to get a spring clean from wrasse and crustacea which remove parasites and dead skin. Where: Maldives. When: December to April. How: Regal Diving (0870 220 1777) has an eight-day trip from \u00a31,129 until April. Turtles What: green and Leatherback turtles practice their one-stop motherhood experience by scrabbling onshore at Tortuguero, a national park on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. They arrive to lay their eggs on a protected beach before swimming away to continue a life of blissful irresponsibility (hunting has now been banned). Where: Costa Rica. When: July to August for green turtles, February to July for Leatherbacks. How: Trips Worldwide (0117 311 4402) offers a 15-day holiday to Costa Rica, including three nights in Tortuguero, from \u00a31,850.

Nevertheless, Assembly Ministers are determined to challenge the Corus cuts if proposals by the ISTC to avoid redundancies by switching to part-time working are rejected. They believe a successful legal challenge could re-open the prospect of successful buyouts. Welsh Assembly sources add that Ministers believe there is a commercial case for retaining the plants in future, particularly since the Government has indicated its intention to decide on a euro referendum within two years of the election. Corus blames the strength of the pound against the single currency for undermining its competitiveness in Europe, and wants early UK entry. Mike German, Deputy First Minister in the assembly, said: 'We believe the union proposals should be given a fair wind and we are not going to act until they have run their course. But we are looking at all options and that includes how the law can help us.'",

      "body": "<p>As Sigmund Freud once said, there is not one human relationship which is not tinged with ambivalence. The same might be said of modern man's relationship with technology. Take the worldwide web: some people love it for its instant access to knowledge, its ability to reach out through cyberspace and create a sense of community, its convenience and speed. Some hate it for its unedited maelstrom of information, its inevitable American bias and its frustrated commercialism.</p> <p>But most of us both love and hate it at the same time, so it's hardly surprising if the idea of therapy via the internet is the subject of hot debate. Certain psychological schools are inherently opposed to e-counselling. Ann Shearer, a Jungian analyst who can be contacted through <a href=\"http://www.igap.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">her website</a> but only works face to face, explained: 'We do in-depth work with the unconscious over a period of time of some intensity. The relationship is crucially important and cannot be replicated by tapping up a picture on screen or sending written messages. But counselling is for one specific problem, whereas analysis is much deeper.'</p> <p>Since face-to-face therapy places great emphasis on body language, tone of voice and other non-verbal signals to diagnose state of mind, many of the fears uninitiated therapists have about online work relate to lack of such peripheral information. 'How can you tell if a client is lying?' is a popular question, according to Kate Anthony, an online counselling consultant and trainer (<a href=\"http://www.onlinecounsellors.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.onlinecounsellors.co.uk</a>). Her answer is always: 'Why should they, since online counselling has to be paid for? In any case, Freudians would argue that any part of a person, real or invented, is still a part of them. \"Acting out\" in cyberspace may be immensely therapeutic.'</p> <p>Anthony is in a better position than most commentators on the subject. As a member of the British Association for Counselling's working party for drawing up ethics and guidelines for online counselling, she was commissioned last year to research the differences between e-counselling and face-to-face work.</p> <p>She talks about the unique features of online therapeutic relationships. The way in which the client's lack of concrete knowledge about his counsellor can allow him to picture him in whatever way suits his therapeutic growth best - there are no 'first impressions' to get over.</p> <p>Then there's electronic rapport or telepresence (being able to communicate so effectively online that the medium of communication between counsellor and client - the computer - seems to disappear), and net-iquette.</p> <p>But these effects clearly have to be experienced to be believed. Of the 20 or so psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, counsellors and former clients whom I canvassed for this article, all those who expressed grave misgivings about online work had little or no experience of it. Those who had experience were uniformly positive - mostly enthusing about the opportunity to communicate directly with another person's psyche without any of the usual prejudices relating to personal appearance, lifestyle, etc - while at the same time being honest about its limitations.</p> <p>More worrying for potential e-clients, perhaps, is the scope for charlatanism - but here the internet is no different from real life (except that there are no opportunities for physical seduction). Several experienced on- and offline therapists interviewed report the occasional brush with dotcom fever. Nicola Blakeney (no longer online due to pressure of conventional work) notes that counsellors who enquire about how much money there is to be made, or wonder idly whether they could increase their client load via the net, are due for a rude awakening.</p> <p>'It's just as time-consuming, if not more so, than face-to-face therapy,' she says. 'And some counsellors naively think they need not impose such rigid boundaries, because of the physical distance. Of course that's not true: your mailbox will be overflowing with the most distressing stories and you have to be clear about how you will deal with them.'</p> <p>It was time to try out cybershrinking for myself. I had been in conventional therapy before, at a time in my life when a long-term relationship was breaking up and I was so miserable I felt I couldn't afford not to go. This time I would use the issues I had confronted then to test out the responses of therapists working by email.</p> <p>Getting started was tough. I typed 'online counselling' into a search engine and came up with 2,000 hits. Some sites give helpful guidance to prospective e-clients but by no means offer recommendations. I plodded on. Among the first sites I looked at was one devoted to the 'totally unique' <a href=\"http://www.tft.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Thought Field Therapy</a> developed by a Californian psychologist, which, unlike any other therapy, is able to offer a 'cure' for psychological problems within minutes. And without requiring the individual to talk about their problem. Then there was a psychodynamics site, <a href=\"http://web.ukonline.co.uk/psychodynamics/index.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/psychodynamics/index.htm</a>, which claimed to use 'the most advanced Psycho-technologies' to resolve personal problems. These were listed alphabetically in a sort of tragicomic shopping list, from abuse, abusive relationships, affairs and alcoholism through to stress management, snoring, transsexuals, transvestites, unfaithfulness, unreasonable behaviour and vaginismus. Oddly, perhaps, I did not feel my problems could be quite so easily categorised. And I certainly did not believe they could be cured within minutes - with or without dialogue.</p> <p>Eventually I found a site (<a href=\"http://www.onlinecounsellingandtherapy.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.onlinecounsellingandtherapy.com</a>) with a slightly tacky picture of a sunrise and a terrestrial address in Seaford.

      "bodyText": "As Sigmund Freud once said, there is not one human relationship which is not tinged with ambivalence. The same might be said of modern man's relationship with technology. Take the worldwide web: some people love it for its instant access to knowledge, its ability to reach out through cyberspace and create a sense of community, its convenience and speed. Some hate it for its unedited maelstrom of information, its inevitable American bias and its frustrated commercialism. But most of us both love and hate it at the same time, so it's hardly surprising if the idea of therapy via the internet is the subject of hot debate. Certain psychological schools are inherently opposed to e-counselling. Ann Shearer, a Jungian analyst who can be contacted through her website but only works face to face, explained: 'We do in-depth work with the unconscious over a period of time of some intensity. The relationship is crucially important and cannot be replicated by tapping up a picture on screen or sending written messages. But counselling is for one specific problem, whereas analysis is much deeper.' Since face-to-face therapy places great emphasis on body language, tone of voice and other non-verbal signals to diagnose state of mind, many of the fears uninitiated therapists have about online work relate to lack of such peripheral information. 'How can you tell if a client is lying?' is a popular question, according to Kate Anthony, an online counselling consultant and trainer (www.onlinecounsellors.co.uk). Her answer is always: 'Why should they, since online counselling has to be paid for? In any case, Freudians would argue that any part of a person, real or invented, is still a part of them. \"Acting out\" in cyberspace may be immensely therapeutic.' Anthony is in a better position than most commentators on the subject. As a member of the British Association for Counselling's working party for drawing up ethics and guidelines for online counselling, she was commissioned last year to research the differences between e-counselling and face-to-face work. She talks about the unique features of online therapeutic relationships. The way in which the client's lack of concrete knowledge about his counsellor can allow him to picture him in whatever way suits his therapeutic growth best - there are no 'first impressions' to get over. Then there's electronic rapport or telepresence (being able to communicate so effectively online that the medium of communication between counsellor and client - the computer - seems to disappear), and net-iquette. But these effects clearly have to be experienced to be believed. Of the 20 or so psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, counsellors and former clients whom I canvassed for this article, all those who expressed grave misgivings about online work had little or no experience of it. Those who had experience were uniformly positive - mostly enthusing about the opportunity to communicate directly with another person's psyche without any of the usual prejudices relating to personal appearance, lifestyle, etc - while at the same time being honest about its limitations. More worrying for potential e-clients, perhaps, is the scope for charlatanism - but here the internet is no different from real life (except that there are no opportunities for physical seduction). Several experienced on- and offline therapists interviewed report the occasional brush with dotcom fever. Nicola Blakeney (no longer online due to pressure of conventional work) notes that counsellors who enquire about how much money there is to be made, or wonder idly whether they could increase their client load via the net, are due for a rude awakening. 'It's just as time-consuming, if not more so, than face-to-face therapy,' she says. 'And some counsellors naively think they need not impose such rigid boundaries, because of the physical distance. Of course that's not true: your mailbox will be overflowing with the most distressing stories and you have to be clear about how you will deal with them.' It was time to try out cybershrinking for myself. I had been in conventional therapy before, at a time in my life when a long-term relationship was breaking up and I was so miserable I felt I couldn't afford not to go. This time I would use the issues I had confronted then to test out the responses of therapists working by email. Getting started was tough. I typed 'online counselling' into a search engine and came up with 2,000 hits. Some sites give helpful guidance to prospective e-clients but by no means offer recommendations. I plodded on. Among the first sites I looked at was one devoted to the 'totally unique' Thought Field Therapy developed by a Californian psychologist, which, unlike any other therapy, is able to offer a 'cure' for psychological problems within minutes. And without requiring the individual to talk about their problem. Then there was a psychodynamics site, http://web.ukonline.co.uk/psychodynamics/index.htm, which claimed to use 'the most advanced Psycho-technologies' to resolve personal problems. These were listed alphabetically in a sort of tragicomic shopping list, from abuse, abusive relationships, affairs and alcoholism through to stress management, snoring, transsexuals, transvestites, unfaithfulness, unreasonable behaviour and vaginismus. Oddly, perhaps, I did not feel my problems could be quite so easily categorised. And I certainly did not believe they could be cured within minutes - with or without dialogue. Eventually I found a site (www.onlinecounsellingandtherapy.com) with a slightly tacky picture of a sunrise and a terrestrial address in Seaford. I didn't feel especially drawn to the 'senior email counsellor' who allegedly had 10 years' experience, but I reasoned that the service was (perhaps unwisely) generous. It cost \u00a340 per week for an unlimited number of emails, which would be promptly answered, with the first email free. I wrote a careful r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a previous failed relationship involving the demon drink and sent it into the ether. I still wonder why there was no reply.

I go to four groups - AA, NA and SA - because I've been addicted to painkillers and alcohol and sex, but my primary addiction is to helping people, so I go to Helpers Anonymous because I'm a compulsive helper... ' <br><strong> David, 36, addict</strong> </p> <p> Addiction used to live on the fringes, the periphery of society, but has spent the last 20 years worming its way into the everyday, the commonplace even. In 1980, this country had fewer than 10 residential addiction centres; there are now 150. Never before have the terms addict, addicts and addiction had such common currency; in 1990, newspapers used these words 428 times; by the year 2000, this figure had risen dramatically to 11,707. </p> <p>And whereas we used to know exactly what we meant by an addict - 'Exhibit A' might be the characters in Trainspotting - now we're not so sure. Along with 'traditional' ideas of addictions to drugs and alcohol, there is now a move to include an ever-increasing number of activities, some of which are, frankly, hard to take seriously. The rise of 12-step therapy groups has contributed to a growing acceptance that there is now almost nothing that cannot be talked of in terms of addiction. There are currently 26 UK 12-step fellowships listed in Addiction Today magazine, including Gamblers Anonymous, Helpers Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous and Workaholics Anonymous. All 'behavioural' addictions and the logical conclusion is out there too: in the US, there is apparently a 12-step group for those who are addicted to going to 12-step groups. </p> <p>The concept of behavioural addictions like these is nothing new in itself. As Deirdre Boyd, the editor of Addiction Today points out, you could say that the first behavioural addiction was identified in the 50s, 15 years after AA was founded, when Al-Anon started for the relatives and friends of alcoholics - 'the addiction to the addict, so to speak'. What is new, though, is the sheer range and number of, on the face of it, rather less obviously damaging behaviours and activities that are currently having the language and treatment of addiction applied to them. </p> <p>There are obvious reasons for the rise in addiction and addicts - the sheer availability of drugs, for one thing. As Boyd says, 'Alcohol, nicotine and other drugs are currently available on a scale that has never been seen before, and it's causing problems.' There is also the fact that more of us have more money. 'At a very simple and crude level, the rise in addiction relates to the fact that we're much more affluent nowadays, because most addictions involve expenditure,' says psychologist Oliver James. 'Something like the rise of smoking and drinking among young women is certainly partly do to with that.' </p> <p> 'Alcohol was my passport to another place where none of the negative things in my life mattered any more. I entered an internal world where I could say anything, do everything, be anybody.' <br> <strong> Paul, 55, alcoholic </strong> </p> <p> The rise in addictions also has a lot to do with our new-found willingness to talk about ourselves in terms of our emotional wellbeing, which in turn is part of our new-found willingness to call ourselves addicts. As James says, we use different language to define ourselves nowadays: 'Instead of talking about our social role in life, we talk about our internal state.' After a century of psychoanalysis and more than 50 years of peace, our lives tend not to be about mere survival any more. These days, we talk in terms of quality of life and self-realisation. </p> <p>Addiction - as one of the big three mental-health issues along with depression and anxiety - is part of that landscape. There is also, as Boyd points out, 'an international media now that communicates all this stuff'. And certainly a day barely goes by without yet another celebrity admitting to an addiction openly and without shame: Naomi goes to Narcotics Anonymous, Geri attends Overeaters Anonymous, Robbie's an alcoholic, Mel Smith was addicted to painkillers, Michael Douglas to sex. Addiction is well and truly out. </p> <p>And, of course, there is a way in which this is very healthy and positive, but there is also concern among some specialists, a feeling that we need to engage rather more critically with the concept of addiction. There are worries around the numbers of people who now see themselves as addicts. Not least of all because addiction is such a potent and powerful concept to buy into. </p> <p>Neil Hunt, a lecturer in addictive behaviours at Kent University, feels that the word addiction is used too variously. 'The word is misused. There is a place for it, but it's being misused, and I think that people are genuinely confused. I believe in compulsive habitual behaviours, but I think it is unhelpful to describe them as addictions. In some ways, it's similar to when people who've got a cold tell you they've got flu; it's simply a way of making a grander claim.' </p> <p>Hand in hand with this lies what Hunt sees as a general trend toward the 'pathologising' of any and all discomforts or anxieties. Which he feels in turn can be seen as a knock-on effect of the new and increasing workforce of people 'who have an interest in understanding problems and their solutions in these terms'. </p> <p>'Obviously this isn't always a bad thing,' Hunt admits. But when it is, it can be disempowering. 'I think one of the messages that comes out of that way of thinking is that you can't sort out your own life - other people, experts, have to do it for you, and that's undermining.' There is a sense in which, he feels, we systematically underestimate the extent to which people can sort things out for themselves. 'I think we are discouraging that by problematising things more and more.' </p> <p> 'I went to NA and allowed myself the window to experience other people who had been where I had been and who loved me, for want of a better word, when I could not love myself. That is NA. That's what it's about. If you've got a problem with your teeth ,you go to the dentist. With drugs, you go to NA.' <br><strong>Kate, 39, drug addict </strong> </p> <p> Having a problem with addiction and going for treatment might mean detox, or therapy, or staying in a residential unit, or indeed all three in the short term, but in the long term it will nearly always involve attending a 12-step group. Attending a 12-step group means seeing yourself as having a disease called addiction that you will have for the rest of your life. Despite not necessarily agreeing with this, practically all professionals who work in addiction recommend 12-step, simply because as crisis intervention and for ongoing support, it works. </p> <p>Professor Nick Heather, an expert in alcoholism, explains. 'If someone gives up alcohol, it leaves an enormous vacuum in their life; they have nothing to do with the time they spent in the pub, and life becomes less meaningful because it was so structured around this behaviour. But if you link up with a whole bunch of people who have this problem, you have a new identity.' A new way of being, if you like, but the point is, first and foremost you are an addict, lots of your friends will be addicts and it will inform everything you do... which is a potent way to define oneself and perhaps just not always appropriate. It's quite a leap to go from having a behaviour that you use too much to seeing yourself in these terms. </p> <p>On top of this, Professor John Davies, a psychologist at Strathclyde University and the author of The Myth of Addiction , says that seeing oneself as an addict is an incapacitating belief. 'Research shows that if someone has a damaging habit, the belief that they are addicted to it makes them less likely to attempt to stop and more likely to fail when they try.' </p> <p> 'I came to a meeting and said, \"My name is Simon and I'm a sex addict.\" I found describing myself as an addict incredibly helpful when I first came to recover. Suddenly the reality of what I had become clicked in to focus.' <br><strong> Simon, 47, sex addict </strong> </p> <p> There is great debate among experts these days about when behaviour should be seen as an addiction. There is little doubt that drugs like alcohol, nicotine and hard drugs are potentially addictive, that is, they have an external pharmacology that acts on our nervous system and their long-term use involves tolerance and withdrawal if we stop using them. They are also clearly damaging to our health in the long term. </p> <p>But what about behaviours like sex, shopping and surfing the net, even - behaviours which aren't inherently damaging, that don't have an external pharmacology, but which are routinely talked about in terms of addiction nowadays? </p> <p>Even among experts there isn't one clear line of thought about this. Professor Griffith Edwards at the National Addiction Centre believes, for example, that talking of shopping or exercise addiction in the same way as, say, alcohol or crack-cocaine addiction can be dangerous. 'You can trivialise the idea of dependency by saying, \"What about shopping, what about pinching cars\", but it's playing with words, really; it's not very like what's going on with heroin.' </p> <p>Jim Offord, professor of psychology at Birmingham University and the author of Excessive Appetites , wants us to extend our understanding of addiction so we don't just see it as being about drugs, but he would only want to include other activities/behaviours that, as he puts it, 'really are a major problem for people - as with, say, sex addiction, overeating and gambling. These are activities that change one's mood dramatically. They're very pleasurable, they can be very reinforcing and therefore it's not surprising that some people get out of control with them and that they cause people terrible problems on a large scale. The problem is that there is a tendency for people to then rush from that and say, \"I'm addicted to shopping\", or chocolate, or to talk about \"love addiction\" or being \"a workaholic\".' </p> <p>For Offord, this is extending the concept a little further than he feels comfortable with. 'There's a danger of seeing addiction as a pan concept when sometimes what people are really talking about are attachments. Caffeine is quite a good example; people get attached to caffeine to the point where they can't easily go out without having a cup of coffee or tea, but it doesn't matter very much.' </p> <p>So have we been overstating the case for addiction? Leaping to use the term more often than we should and in a way that isn't always appropriate or healthy? John Davies's assertion that 'talking about habits, un- fortunate habits that people persist in, like the internet, shopping or working as addictions, is a totally bogus concept' may seem a little strong, but at the very least we should acknowledge the dangers of talking oneself into such a loaded position, of calling oneself an addict and buying into all that implies, or of accepting the label unquestioningly. </p> <p>As Davies points out, 'The Diagnostic and Statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association says that a hallmark of addiction is that a person continues to do something despite clear knowledge that it is damaging. Well, I climb a bit, and one of my heroes carries on climbing despite incurring lots of injuries, which are clearly damaging. Do we therefore conclude that he needs treatment because he's sick? I don't think so.' </p> <p>Of course the irony is, as Deirdre Boyd says, 'If you're not an addict, you'll probably rush to say you are; if you are, you'll deny it for a long time.' </p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed and photographs are posed by models.</p>",

Addiction - as one of the big three mental-health issues along with depression and anxiety - is part of that landscape. There is also, as Boyd points out, 'an international media now that communicates all this stuff'. And certainly a day barely goes by without yet another celebrity admitting to an addiction openly and without shame: Naomi goes to Narcotics Anonymous, Geri attends Overeaters Anonymous, Robbie's an alcoholic, Mel Smith was addicted to painkillers, Michael Douglas to sex. Addiction is well and truly out. And, of course, there is a way in which this is very healthy and positive, but there is also concern among some specialists, a feeling that we need to engage rather more critically with the concept of addiction. There are worries around the numbers of people who now see themselves as addicts. Not least of all because addiction is such a potent and powerful concept to buy into. Neil Hunt, a lecturer in addictive behaviours at Kent University, feels that the word addiction is used too variously. 'The word is misused. There is a place for it, but it's being misused, and I think that people are genuinely confused. I believe in compulsive habitual behaviours, but I think it is unhelpful to describe them as addictions. In some ways, it's similar to when people who've got a cold tell you they've got flu; it's simply a way of making a grander claim.' Hand in hand with this lies what Hunt sees as a general trend toward the 'pathologising' of any and all discomforts or anxieties. Which he feels in turn can be seen as a knock-on effect of the new and increasing workforce of people 'who have an interest in understanding problems and their solutions in these terms'. 'Obviously this isn't always a bad thing,' Hunt admits. But when it is, it can be disempowering. 'I think one of the messages that comes out of that way of thinking is that you can't sort out your own life - other people, experts, have to do it for you, and that's undermining.' There is a sense in which, he feels, we systematically underestimate the extent to which people can sort things out for themselves. 'I think we are discouraging that by problematising things more and more.' 'I went to NA and allowed myself the window to experience other people who had been where I had been and who loved me, for want of a better word, when I could not love myself. That is NA. That's what it's about. If you've got a problem with your teeth ,you go to the dentist. With drugs, you go to NA.' Kate, 39, drug addict Having a problem with addiction and going for treatment might mean detox, or therapy, or staying in a residential unit, or indeed all three in the short term, but in the long term it will nearly always involve attending a 12-step group. Attending a 12-step group means seeing yourself as having a disease called addiction that you will have for the rest of your life. Despite not necessarily agreeing with this, practically all professionals who work in addiction recommend 12-step, simply because as crisis intervention and for ongoing support, it works. Professor Nick Heather, an expert in alcoholism, explains. 'If someone gives up alcohol, it leaves an enormous vacuum in their life; they have nothing to do with the time they spent in the pub, and life becomes less meaningful because it was so structured around this behaviour. But if you link up with a whole bunch of people who have this problem, you have a new identity.' A new way of being, if you like, but the point is, first and foremost you are an addict, lots of your friends will be addicts and it will inform everything you do... which is a potent way to define oneself and perhaps just not always appropriate. It's quite a leap to go from having a behaviour that you use too much to seeing yourself in these terms. On top of this, Professor John Davies, a psychologist at Strathclyde University and the author of The Myth of Addiction , says that seeing oneself as an addict is an incapacitating belief. 'Research shows that if someone has a damaging habit, the belief that they are addicted to it makes them less likely to attempt to stop and more likely to fail when they try.' 'I came to a meeting and said, \"My name is Simon and I'm a sex addict.\" I found describing myself as an addict incredibly helpful when I first came to recover. Suddenly the reality of what I had become clicked in to focus.' Simon, 47, sex addict There is great debate among experts these days about when behaviour should be seen as an addiction. There is little doubt that drugs like alcohol, nicotine and hard drugs are potentially addictive, that is, they have an external pharmacology that acts on our nervous system and their long-term use involves tolerance and withdrawal if we stop using them. They are also clearly damaging to our health in the long term. But what about behaviours like sex, shopping and surfing the net, even - behaviours which aren't inherently damaging, that don't have an external pharmacology, but which are routinely talked about in terms of addiction nowadays? Even among experts there isn't one clear line of thought about this. Professor Griffith Edwards at the National Addiction Centre believes, for example, that talking of shopping or exercise addiction in the same way as, say, alcohol or crack-cocaine addiction can be dangerous. 'You can trivialise the idea of dependency by saying, \"What about shopping, what about pinching cars\", but it's playing with words, really; it's not very like what's going on with heroin.' Jim Offord, professor of psychology at Birmingham University and the author of Excessive Appetites , wants us to extend our understanding of addiction so we don't just see it as being about drugs, but he would only want to include other activities/behaviours that, as he puts it, 'really are a major problem for people - as with, say, sex addiction, overeating and gambling. These are activities that change one's mood dramatically. They're very pleasurable, they can be very reinforcing and therefore it's not surprising that some people get out of control with them and that they cause people terrible problems on a large scale. The problem is that there is a tendency for people to then rush from that and say, \"I'm addicted to shopping\", or chocolate, or to talk about \"love addiction\" or being \"a workaholic\".' For Offord, this is extending the concept a little further than he feels comfortable with. 'There's a danger of seeing addiction as a pan concept when sometimes what people are really talking about are attachments. Caffeine is quite a good example; people get attached to caffeine to the point where they can't easily go out without having a cup of coffee or tea, but it doesn't matter very much.' So have we been overstating the case for addiction? Leaping to use the term more often than we should and in a way that isn't always appropriate or healthy? John Davies's assertion that 'talking about habits, un- fortunate habits that people persist in, like the internet, shopping or working as addictions, is a totally bogus concept' may seem a little strong, but at the very least we should acknowledge the dangers of talking oneself into such a loaded position, of calling oneself an addict and buying into all that implies, or of accepting the label unquestioningly. As Davies points out, 'The Diagnostic and Statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association says that a hallmark of addiction is that a person continues to do something despite clear knowledge that it is damaging. Well, I climb a bit, and one of my heroes carries on climbing despite incurring lots of injuries, which are clearly damaging. Do we therefore conclude that he needs treatment because he's sick? I don't think so.' Of course the irony is, as Deirdre Boyd says, 'If you're not an addict, you'll probably rush to say you are; if you are, you'll deny it for a long time.' \u0095 Some names have been changed and photographs are posed by models.",

      "body": "<p>Billy Bob Thornton is waking up. He's been working a lot, making a lot of movies, so he's tired. He's been making a record, too, after hours. The voice of Johnny Cash, in duet with Billy Bob's own voice, streams from the speakers. They sound pretty good together. Marty Stuart, the producer, is up from Nashville, and he's burning CDs tonight here at the studio, and it's late, after 2am, all the girls have gone home, and Marty's switched from champagne to Mountain Dew. This is the first time he's heard the full mix. 'This record is tryin' to be something.' He says to Jim, the engineer. 'It's comin', it's comin', it's comin'. I see its little head.'</p> <p>Billy Bob's been asleep on the couch, which is funny, because normally he needs to be told to go to sleep, and Marty says this is the most rest he's gotten since 1979. 'I've wore his ass out,' Marty says, even though he's known Billy Bob only a couple years. As Billy Bob's mother says, her boy's been 'keeping the roads hot'. It's a composed sleep, no more than a half-hour or so - his face has not gone slack - and it seems as if he's beginning to stir. His hands are still folded between his knees, his head bowed, chin to his chest. His cap, which reads Henry Swing Club, is pulled low. His skin is amber, the colour of whiskey. A short-sleeved bowling shirt covers most of his tattoos, but one peeks out from under his left sleeve. He wears a black leather band on one wrist and black jeans and black tasselled motorcycle boots, which are starting to show signs of life. He is a parched and worn 45, but in sleep he has the aspect of a baby. People want to stay around and make sure nothing bad happens to him. A hand goes up to his face, an index finger softly rubs the bridge of his nose, and then the hand goes slack as he dissolves again into sleep. He is clean-shaven. He looks like a farmer, not a movie star.</p> <p>This is Billy Bob's couch, in the recording studio that also belongs to him, in the basement of his new house in Beverly Hills. He's owned the place since June, just after he got married to Angelina Jolie - he calls her Angie - and they paid more than $3m for it. The house is 11,000sqft, and it has this recording studio in the basement, which is a big reason Billy Bob wanted it. Slash, the former guitarist for Guns N' Roses, lived here before. Billy Bob's a Hollywood guy, yes, but his music is important to him, and this is not going to be one of those actor-wants-to-be-a-rock-star records, so he doesn't talk about it much. But the studio is a comfortable room, and he likes it. He hasn't really unpacked yet. Boxes are stacked against one wall alongside a framed Pink Floyd poster. There are a couple of oriental rugs, an acoustic guitar, a box labelled Billy Bob's Drum Kit.</p> <p>Billy Bob lifts his head and squints for a second, and then suddenly he is all awake, as if he had never been asleep. He hears Johnny Cash. 'I think his voice is a little hot,' he says softly. Marty's sitting at the soundboard. He adjusts a few knobs. Billy Bob wonders if they should get Cash to record his vocals again. Marty says, 'It's easier to sing to Mount Rushmore than to have Mount Rushmore sing to you.' Then Marty says, 'Time to go, cuz. OK, enough work for tonight. Time to go to bed.'</p> <p>Billy Bob gets to his feet and heads upstairs. He scrapes his heels when he walks, as if the boots are weighing him down. On the landing, he passes a huge arrow pointing back down to the studio. There's a sign on it that reads The Snakepit. Upstairs, the house is a construction zone. Only one room is finished. Newspapers mask the floors. Buckets of paint are stacked along the walls in the foyer. Angie's in London, working, so he's in charge of the renovation. The bedrooms on the second floor all have sliding glass doors that overlook a small outdoor pool. Billy Bob likes the fact that it has the feel of a motel and wants to preserve that. 'I'll never live a normal life,' he says. 'But I try to keep bits of it in my life. Just the idea of having a house, of buying one, knowing there's someplace to call home.'</p> <p>He walks over, flips off the big TV, which has been playing on mute all night, and then goes to the front door. 'Come on, we're goin',' he says. He steps out, lights a cigarette, and locks the door. He won't be sleeping here. 'Nooo sir,' he says, heading for his truck. 'Not until a guy comes and checks the place out for snake eggs.'</p> <p>The house may have a snake problem. Slash liked snakes and kept them in cages and boxes and pens all over the house. Billy Bob can't abide snakes. He hasn't yet spent the night in the house, and he won't until the snake-egg guy comes.</p> <p>He doesn't live in places easily. He once lived in New York City for 10 hours before driving back to Arkansas, defeated and afraid. Tonight he's going to sleep at the Sunset Marquis, the hotel where he's lived off and on for years.</p> <p>When he gets to the hotel, he'll call his bride, who'll just be starting her day. Well, maybe he'll call her. He's not sure. 'It's one of the things I like about this marriage,' he says. 'I was always afraid in relationships before, but I'm not afraid of her. Well, I am afraid of her, I told her that once. First I told her I wasn't afraid of her, and then 20 minutes later I told her the opposite, that I was afraid of her.' So maybe he'll call.</p> <p>This is an early evening for him. He's got to get up at six to cut hair because he's in a movie. He's playing a barber.</p> <p>It's a great night out, warm, swimming weather, but all the Beverly Hills mansions on Billy Bob's street, all built during the same few years - late 20s, early 30s - for the first generation of Hollywood royalty, are dark now. Who could be in bed on a night like this? It's going on 3am, and so Billy Bob's boots and his voice echo a little as he shuffles towards his truck. He's looking at the dark houses. 'I hate people who go to sleep early,' he says.</p> <p><b> 11pm, second night </b></p> <p>Billy Bob will never live a normal life. So he went to work today, made some film, negotiated some deal. All real work in the adult world. A bunch of extras lined up at sunrise for haircuts. 'Most nervous extras you ever saw,' Billy Bob says. He gave a couple of flat-tops with antique clippers. It's a Coen brothers film, known currently as The Untitled Barber Project. He is, by all accounts, a delight to be around with on the set, any set. He is kind, funny and inspiring to other actors, and reverential about the work, having had a strange sense of hillbilly destiny about it ever since his mother told him not to worry, he's made it, one day he would work with Burt Reynolds. (He has.)</p> <p>He's got six movies coming out in the next year, four of which he's acting in and two of which he directed, including All the Pretty Horses, the $45m-adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, and The Gift, which he wrote about his mother - both films are due out in the UK next month. He's never been busier and never been more tired; he's got a cough and there's so much day-time work, too, so many decisions to make, so many people to take care of, so much writing to get done, so many stories to get out of himself before it's too late.</p> <p>'I've got so much shit backed up that it almost gives me an aneurysm,' he says. 'I've got at least another 20 movies in me.'</p> <p>But after dark, Billy Bob's mind seems so starved that he won't sleep voluntarily or easily; he never has since he was a kid, and at these times he has been known even to seek out the interesting company of those he doesn't know very well, and he is disappointed when they don't have the stamina for his hours. 'Oh, no, come on, you can't leave!' he'll say.</p> <p>The bar at his hotel is called the Whiskey, and the candlelit patio out front, with its low wrought-iron tables, is Billy Bob's nocturnal office. There's always somebody or somebody's entourage here. Blonde, lithe young things everywhere. And lots of musicians; there's a recording studio in the basement here, too. And everybody touches everybody else. Little touches, lots of hands, which is fine with Billy Bob because he's from the South, and there they drape themselves all over you.</p> <p>Billy Bob keeps pretty regular hours here, and the Reverend Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top drops by sometimes. He's here tonight, and this is cool because it was not very long ago at all that Billy Bob was the completely unfamous drummer of a ZZ tribute band, Tres Hombres, which Gibbons now graciously calls 'the best little cover band in Texas'. And earlier, Billy Bob jammed in an upstairs room with Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes. And now the Irish director Jim Sheridan pulls up a chair, and Billy Bob talks to him about boxing movies because that's something that Sheridan knows about, and Billy Bob's thinking about directing a boxing movie for Miramax, even though he's said no to all studio films, forever ('Well, at least with Miramax you know whose ass you're kissing'), and lord knows how he'll find the time and preserve his health, but he's already seeing scenes in his head, so he figures it's the right thing to do.</p> <p>Life at the Sunset Marquis has other rewards. There's a gym that Billy Bob uses when he finds himself in bouts of self-improvement. He sometimes works out in his cowboy-and-Indian pjs, and he'll wear Angie's pink underwear. 'Once I was lifting weights, and I thought they were hidden, but some guy kept looking at me strange,' he says. 'Finally, I said, \"They're my wife's.\" I don't think it's strange at all. I wear them to the set some days. I like having her close to me, you know?'</p> <p>Another good thing about the hotel is that everybody knows him here, and the bartenders at the Whiskey are as much as he'll indulge himself in psychotherapy any more. Along the way, he's entered therapy a few times and even tried it with a couple of his ex-wives when things started souring. But he doesn't trust it. 'People in LA think you learn by therapy. But you learn by living. I mean, if you've got to get over having your puppy run over when you were nine, fine, but you've got to keep living.</p> <p>'See, I've fucked a lot of things up. I've been wrong. In relationships, I've been, like, not present. Or doing some wrong things. People talk about working on things. I don't like to work on things. I never like working on things. When I write, I don't work on it. I start, and I finish. If it don't come out in one long stream of consciousness, it ain't for me. I don't want to construct when I love, when I write. I don't want to go to couples therapy to solve a relationship. I don't want to work on it. I don't believe in it, never have.'</p> <p>Billy Bob had been with the actress Laura Dern for three years when she went off to make a movie. When she got back, Billy Bob was married to Angie. He knows that lots of people out here are sympathetic to Dern's side of things. 'Others may say that you left our girl and married someone else,' he says. 'But it made me happy and somebody else happy. I'm sorry it caused pain.'</p> <p>As the evening unwinds and the foot traffic slows down, Billy Bob chain-smokes and drinks bottles of water and hangs out, talking about All the Pretty Horses and his idea of the movies. He finished the film some time ago but continues to edit, tweak and fight battles over every little thing. He went to test screenings. He knows the audience out there is finicky. 'You've got people who only want to see someone screw an apple pie. But some people are sick and tired of it. They want raw stuff again. We did the movie the way they used to do it.'</p> <p>All the Pretty Horses is a modern epic, with 'interiors out of Sling Blade ' and 'outdoors that look like John Ford', with a big budget and big stars, directed by a guy who's never been trusted with more than a few million dollars before. 'I think the natural tendency these days is to use one of the big guys to direct. I'm not one of them.'</p> <p>Out of nowhere, someone asks, 'When are you going to London?' Billy Bob's fear of flying is famous. Before he gets on a plane, he'll call his mother, who is psychic, to ask her if it's safe. He'll go over there on one condition, he says - if Angie'll take him on the Jack the Ripper tour.</p> <p>It's quiet for a minute, and then Billy Bob speaks. 'You know she won't do anything to hurt me, because she knows it'll hurt her more,' he says.</p> <p>Billy Bob orders more cigarettes and gets up to pee. As he's walking back, he's already talking. He seems excited, maybe exercised. 'Did you ever look at a woman when she's asleep, and you think, who the fuck is that ?' he says, and sits down. 'And, like, the moonlight's coming in when you're sleeping next to her at night and you can kind of see her face - and she looks like a fucking monster ? This might be somebody you have been with for years. And you look at her, and it's like, who in God's name is that? Why - she's a stranger. What is she doing here? I don't even know her. And much of the daytime, you're like, \"Oh, honey, I love you. Are you OK? How was that today?\" But when she's asleep, that's how you really feel about her.'</p> <p><b> 8pm, same night </b></p> <p>Billy Bob bleeds [St Louise] Cardinal red, but the Dodgers will do for tonight. He got good tickets and decided to catch a game. Back in Malvern, Arkansas, Billy Bob was a hometown baseball hero, the promising kid who got a major league try-out at 18, got nailed by a bad throw, and broke his collarbone. 'There's nothing in the movies or entertainment that feels like the third pitch that strikes a guy out,' he says.</p> <p>Billy Bob remembers that his father hung a tyre up in the yard so that he could practise his pitching. 'It's the one place my dad and I connected every now and then,' he says. He looks around Dodger Stadium, shrugs his shoulders, and squints. 'Or maybe that's my fantasy.'</p> <p>Billy Bob was not close to his father. Billy Ray Thornton was gone a lot, teaching and coaching mostly basketball at small high schools out of town. Billy Bob says that every film he does is reckoning with his father. 'In my movies, there's either shitty fathers, absent fathers, fathers that you want their approval. Or the father's just not there. He died or whatever.'</p> <p>After the game, Billy Bob's in the car talking on the phone to his most recent ex-wife, Pietra, with whom he has two young sons. 'Don't make any plans for Friday night. We can make a dessert like strawberry shortcake or something like that.' He's sweet and kind to her now. It's late, but his kids aren't asleep. One of his boys announces over the phone that he's trying to kill a spider. 'Your mom ripped his body off? Wait, what - the spider's on his back, shivering with a chicken bone in his mouth? Well, that's a huge spider. Oh, that's the dog. OK, honey, did your mom tell you that I'm coming Friday night and we're gonna cook? We're gonna make something, just you and your brother and me and your mom. You sure are, baby, you are the luckiest boy. I love you. Goodnight, baby.'</p> <p><b> 1am, first night</b></p> <p>The house is rockin', sort of. In the one finished room, Billy Bob's trying to convince Odessa, his young assistant, that he always wanted to 'fuck a midget'.</p> <p>'I always wanted to fuck a midget,' he tells her in earnest. 'I just wanted to see what it was like. I don't any more. But didn't you ever want to?'</p> <p>'No!' Odessa yelps in a slurry North Carolina accent. She's 25, pretty, and has worked with Billy Bob for a couple of years.</p> <p>'I always wanted to just pick them up by the ankles,' Billy Bob goes on. 'Think of all the things you could do with 'em. You can pick 'em up, turn 'em upside down by their ankles.' He holds up an imaginary midget, shakes it a little.</p> <p>Then he's slow dancing, loving the midget up and down. Odessa backs off a bit. Kristin, another assistant, is on the couch with Odessa's pit bull, Percy, giggling.</p> <p>'I've seen midgets fucking,' Billy Bob says.</p> <p>'You've seen it?' Odessa asks.</p> <p>'Of course!' he says</p> <p>'What do you mean, of course ? Like everybody has?'</p> <p>'Not like everybody else has,' he says. 'Like I have.'</p> <p>'I don't ever want to see that,' Odessa says. 'It's just wrong.'</p> <p>Marty Stuart comes whistling up from the studio. 'More bubbly?' Billy Bob asks, cackling. He's broken out champagne, ecstatic that he wrote a new song tonight. And that's as good a reason as any to make this night the first party in the new house.</p> <p>'Slash had a room full of iguanas over there.' Billy Bob points past the bar. 'Man, I can't stand a lizard. I don't like that skin, I don't like the way they look.' Percy the pit bull ambles over and rubs against Billy Bob's leg. The dog's got a long, mean scar on his back. Odessa rescued him from somewhere up in the Hollywood Hills. It's one of the things Billy likes about Odessa, that her heart's so big. Another thing is that she genuinely doesn't seem to know or care who's famous and who's not, except for the day she saw Rhea Perlman [Carla from Cheers ] on the street and just about lost it.</p> <p>'Marty and I were talking today,' Billy Bob says, 'about how in the South it's all right to beat a dog.'</p> <p>He and Marty are trying to work each other up.</p> <p>'It's a kind of a way of life,' Marty says. Both men are laughing, their shoulders shaking. 'There's a place in Nashville,' Marty says. 'where you could get braces for your dog's teeth. The dog dentist. If your dog had buckteeth, you could get him braces.'</p> <p>'Oh, well, that's just ridiculous,' Odessa says.</p> <p>'Not if you're a buck-toothed dog!' Billy Bob says.</p> <p>Ime Etuk walks in, a soft-spoken black man in his twenties. Ime's an assistant director around town and Billy Bob's bowling buddy.</p> <p>'You got a marijuana cigarette?' Billy Bob asks Ime.</p> <p>'Not on me,' Ime says.</p> <p>Billy Bob is happy and loose, and he wants to have fun. He wants to have fun like Sinatra did, all night and whatever the hell he wanted. He can't wait for the house to be up and running so that he can get a little of that Southern Rat Pack feeling. A pool table, table football, and a Velcro room of his own design.</p> <p>'Where are all my bitches?' Billy Bob cries out. 'I know I have more bitches than this! Odessa, call people! Tell 'em to come over!'</p> <p>'We tried to call everybody,' Kristin says. 'We told them it was a pyjama party.'</p> <p>'What's wrong with the world?' Billy Bob says.</p> <p>'Everybody's tired,' Kristin says.</p> <p>'Well I'm tired, too .'</p> <p>Alex, Billy Bob's chef, shows up, along with a blonde actress and a producer and a guy in a suit. Alex says that during the filming of All the Pretty Horses, she had to call Arkansas to 'find out from his momma how to make chocolate gravy and biscuits'. Billy Bob veers into a story about the night he saw a man barking his ass off in a grocery store. This was in Santa Fe late at night, after a day of shooting All the Pretty Horses , when Billy Bob and a couple of the girls were looking for a midnight snack. 'We've always been addicted to various kinds of cereal,' Billy Bob says.</p> <p>'Cap'n Crunch!' Odessa says.</p> <p>'Golden Grahams!' Kristin says.</p> <p>'There was a guy there barking his ass off, just throwing his head back, doing the whole thing. I love that shit. I love that shit!'</p> <p>The party never becomes more than Ime, Marty, a couple of girls, and a dog on the couch. It's a work night. The girls want to go home. Billy Bob's got a joke. Won't they stay to hear it? 'So Bubba and Marcel decide they're going to go back to school...' He turns to Odessa. 'You know this one right?'</p> <p>'No!' Her voice is rising now, a little irritated. 'I don't know what you're talking about.'</p> <p>Billy Bob looks at her.</p> <p>'I'll call you in the morning,' she says.</p> <p>'Will you call me at 5.30am?' Billy Bob asks gently. 'And again at 6am? I need like nine wake-up calls.'</p> <p>The girls are gone. 'It's a holy day,' Billy Bob says softly. 'Elvis died today.' When Billy Bob was two, his mother took him out to the highway to watch as the King's bus passed by their little town. They stood there by the road, waving.</p> <p>He stretches out on the couch, his physical depletion starting to show. His enthusiasm is faltering. He seems tamed. 'I know I'm compulsive,' he says. 'I'm hungry for the horrible shit, but I can't do that. Not any more. I got something good, and I'm not gonna mess it up.' It's quite late, going on 2am, and he's tired and ruminative all of a sudden. He's thinking about his father. 'Some of the things he loved are things I love, even though he and I didn't know each other or get along. And I have some of his traits.' He says that when his father got upset, he'd go away, disappear. 'That's me, too,' he says.</p> <p>His voice is rasping. Some involuntary twitches. Sometimes he gets so tired that his face starts to twitch. He'll blink his eyes and his whole face seems to blink. He just doesn't have the reserves he had when he was young.</p> <p>'But my father didn't like music,' he says. 'At all. He might be the only man I ever met who didn't like music. There were two songs he liked - \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"Easter Parade\". It seemed incongruous.' He's talking so softly now, almost whispering. 'One's about the magic and wonder of childhood and the hard, cold facts about loss, and the other one is a celebration with hats.' He begins to hum, closing his eyes, and then he sings softly: In your Easter bonnet/With all the frills upon it/You'll be the grandest lady/In the Easter parade.</p> <p>He wants to go downstairs. He wants Ime to hear the new song he wrote, 'Beauty at the Back Door'. They follow the arrow down the stairs into Slash's Snakepit, where Marty and Jim, the engineer, are behind the glass. Ime and Billy Bob sit on the little couch.</p> <p>It's a song about screen doors and myrtle bushes and love, about memory and desire and loss. A little slide guitar, but mostly Billy Bob's voice. It's a spoken-word song, raw, stripped down, a Southern-gothic Leonard Cohen.</p> <p>'My, that's a snappy western shirt you got on,' Billy Bob says to Marty faintly. 'You goin' to a singin'?'</p> <p>'Yeah, I'm going to a singin',' Marty says.</p> <p>And then Billy Bob sings another song, called 'Poison Honey'.</p> <p>His voice is smoky. She draws me in like a moth to a flame/And sometimes at night, I call out her name.</p> <p>'Albums are supposed to reflect what's going on in your life,' Marty says.</p> <p>Billy Bob laughs. 'Then I'm fucked.'</p> <p>There's darkness all around, as the evening shadows fall/Time keeps dragging by, but she ain't coming home at all.</p> <p>Billy Bob listens to the music, his fingers touching his lips. He likes the song, likes where it's going. He crosses his legs, gets comfortable. His eyelids slip down, shut, open, shut. In a few weeks, he'll have run himself down so bad that he'll be in the hospital. But for now, he's got to be up in a few hours, working. His cough will become bronchitis, and an infection will inflame his heart. But in the morning, the extras will be waiting for haircuts. Angie will rush from London to his side. But for now, he folds his hands, nestles them between his knees. The doctor will tell him, 'You know, Billy Bob, you don't have to starve yourself and not sleep.' And Billy Bob, in a burst of light, will promise himself to go on living. But now his shoulders hunch. The music sounds good, like a dream from childhood. His eyes close.</p> <p>Billy Bob Thornton is asleep.</p> <p>\u0095 All the Pretty Horses is released on 9 March, and The Gift will be released on 2 March.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Billy Bob Thornton is waking up. He's been working a lot, making a lot of movies, so he's tired. He's been making a record, too, after hours. The voice of Johnny Cash, in duet with Billy Bob's own voice, streams from the speakers. They sound pretty good together. Marty Stuart, the producer, is up from Nashville, and he's burning CDs tonight here at the studio, and it's late, after 2am, all the girls have gone home, and Marty's switched from champagne to Mountain Dew. This is the first time he's heard the full mix. 'This record is tryin' to be something.' He says to Jim, the engineer. 'It's comin', it's comin', it's comin'. I see its little head.' Billy Bob's been asleep on the couch, which is funny, because normally he needs to be told to go to sleep, and Marty says this is the most rest he's gotten since 1979. 'I've wore his ass out,' Marty says, even though he's known Billy Bob only a couple years. As Billy Bob's mother says, her boy's been 'keeping the roads hot'. It's a composed sleep, no more than a half-hour or so - his face has not gone slack - and it seems as if he's beginning to stir. His hands are still folded between his knees, his head bowed, chin to his chest. His cap, which reads Henry Swing Club, is pulled low. His skin is amber, the colour of whiskey. A short-sleeved bowling shirt covers most of his tattoos, but one peeks out from under his left sleeve. He wears a black leather band on one wrist and black jeans and black tasselled motorcycle boots, which are starting to show signs of life. He is a parched and worn 45, but in sleep he has the aspect of a baby. People want to stay around and make sure nothing bad happens to him. A hand goes up to his face, an index finger softly rubs the bridge of his nose, and then the hand goes slack as he dissolves again into sleep. He is clean-shaven. He looks like a farmer, not a movie star. This is Billy Bob's couch, in the recording studio that also belongs to him, in the basement of his new house in Beverly Hills. He's owned the place since June, just after he got married to Angelina Jolie - he calls her Angie - and they paid more than $3m for it. The house is 11,000sqft, and it has this recording studio in the basement, which is a big reason Billy Bob wanted it. Slash, the former guitarist for Guns N' Roses, lived here before. Billy Bob's a Hollywood guy, yes, but his music is important to him, and this is not going to be one of those actor-wants-to-be-a-rock-star records, so he doesn't talk about it much. But the studio is a comfortable room, and he likes it. He hasn't really unpacked yet. Boxes are stacked against one wall alongside a framed Pink Floyd poster. There are a couple of oriental rugs, an acoustic guitar, a box labelled Billy Bob's Drum Kit. Billy Bob lifts his head and squints for a second, and then suddenly he is all awake, as if he had never been asleep. He hears Johnny Cash. 'I think his voice is a little hot,' he says softly. Marty's sitting at the soundboard. He adjusts a few knobs. Billy Bob wonders if they should get Cash to record his vocals again. Marty says, 'It's easier to sing to Mount Rushmore than to have Mount Rushmore sing to you.' Then Marty says, 'Time to go, cuz. OK, enough work for tonight. Time to go to bed.' Billy Bob gets to his feet and heads upstairs. He scrapes his heels when he walks, as if the boots are weighing him down. On the landing, he passes a huge arrow pointing back down to the studio. There's a sign on it that reads The Snakepit. Upstairs, the house is a construction zone. Only one room is finished. Newspapers mask the floors. Buckets of paint are stacked along the walls in the foyer. Angie's in London, working, so he's in charge of the renovation. The bedrooms on the second floor all have sliding glass doors that overlook a small outdoor pool. Billy Bob likes the fact that it has the feel of a motel and wants to preserve that. 'I'll never live a normal life,' he says. 'But I try to keep bits of it in my life. Just the idea of having a house, of buying one, knowing there's someplace to call home.' He walks over, flips off the big TV, which has been playing on mute all night, and then goes to the front door. 'Come on, we're goin',' he says. He steps out, lights a cigarette, and locks the door. He won't be sleeping here. 'Nooo sir,' he says, heading for his truck. 'Not until a guy comes and checks the place out for snake eggs.' The house may have a snake problem. Slash liked snakes and kept them in cages and boxes and pens all over the house. Billy Bob can't abide snakes. He hasn't yet spent the night in the house, and he won't until the snake-egg guy comes. He doesn't live in places easily. He once lived in New York City for 10 hours before driving back to Arkansas, defeated and afraid. Tonight he's going to sleep at the Sunset Marquis, the hotel where he's lived off and on for years. When he gets to the hotel, he'll call his bride, who'll just be starting her day. Well, maybe he'll call her. He's not sure. 'It's one of the things I like about this marriage,' he says. 'I was always afraid in relationships before, but I'm not afraid of her. Well, I am afraid of her, I told her that once. First I told her I wasn't afraid of her, and then 20 minutes later I told her the opposite, that I was afraid of her.' So maybe he'll call. This is an early evening for him. He's got to get up at six to cut hair because he's in a movie. He's playing a barber. It's a great night out, warm, swimming weather, but all the Beverly Hills mansions on Billy Bob's street, all built during the same few years - late 20s, early 30s - for the first generation of Hollywood royalty, are dark now. Who could be in bed on a night like this? It's going on 3am, and so Billy Bob's boots and his voice echo a little as he shuffles towards his truck. He's looking at the dark houses. 'I hate people who go to sleep early,' he says. 11pm, second night Billy Bob will never live a normal life. So he went to work today, made some film, negotiated some deal. All real work in the adult world. A bunch of extras lined up at sunrise for haircuts. 'Most nervous extras you ever saw,' Billy Bob says. He gave a couple of flat-tops with antique clippers. It's a Coen brothers film, known currently as The Untitled Barber Project. He is, by all accounts, a delight to be around with on the set, any set. He is kind, funny and inspiring to other actors, and reverential about the work, having had a strange sense of hillbilly destiny about it ever since his mother told him not to worry, he's made it, one day he would work with Burt Reynolds. (He has.) He's got six movies coming out in the next year, four of which he's acting in and two of which he directed, including All the Pretty Horses, the $45m-adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, and The Gift, which he wrote about his mother - both films are due out in the UK next month. He's never been busier and never been more tired; he's got a cough and there's so much day-time work, too, so many decisions to make, so many people to take care of, so much writing to get done, so many stories to get out of himself before it's too late. 'I've got so much shit backed up that it almost gives me an aneurysm,' he says. 'I've got at least another 20 movies in me.' But after dark, Billy Bob's mind seems so starved that he won't sleep voluntarily or easily; he never has since he was a kid, and at these times he has been known even to seek out the interesting company of those he doesn't know very well, and he is disappointed when they don't have the stamina for his hours. 'Oh, no, come on, you can't leave!' he'll say. The bar at his hotel is called the Whiskey, and the candlelit patio out front, with its low wrought-iron tables, is Billy Bob's nocturnal office. There's always somebody or somebody's entourage here. Blonde, lithe young things everywhere. And lots of musicians; there's a recording studio in the basement here, too. And everybody touches everybody else. Little touches, lots of hands, which is fine with Billy Bob because he's from the South, and there they drape themselves all over you. Billy Bob keeps pretty regular hours here, and the Reverend Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top drops by sometimes. He's here tonight, and this is cool because it was not very long ago at all that Billy Bob was the completely unfamous drummer of a ZZ tribute band, Tres Hombres, which Gibbons now graciously calls 'the best little cover band in Texas'. And earlier, Billy Bob jammed in an upstairs room with Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes. And now the Irish director Jim Sheridan pulls up a chair, and Billy Bob talks to him about boxing movies because that's something that Sheridan knows about, and Billy Bob's thinking about directing a boxing movie for Miramax, even though he's said no to all studio films, forever ('Well, at least with Miramax you know whose ass you're kissing'), and lord knows how he'll find the time and preserve his health, but he's already seeing scenes in his head, so he figures it's the right thing to do. Life at the Sunset Marquis has other rewards. There's a gym that Billy Bob uses when he finds himself in bouts of self-improvement. He sometimes works out in his cowboy-and-Indian pjs, and he'll wear Angie's pink underwear. 'Once I was lifting weights, and I thought they were hidden, but some guy kept looking at me strange,' he says. 'Finally, I said, \"They're my wife's.\" I don't think it's strange at all. I wear them to the set some days. I like having her close to me, you know?' Another good thing about the hotel is that everybody knows him here, and the bartenders at the Whiskey are as much as he'll indulge himself in psychotherapy any more. Along the way, he's entered therapy a few times and even tried it with a couple of his ex-wives when things started souring. But he doesn't trust it. 'People in LA think you learn by therapy. But you learn by living. I mean, if you've got to get over having your puppy run over when you were nine, fine, but you've got to keep living. 'See, I've fucked a lot of things up. I've been wrong. In relationships, I've been, like, not present. Or doing some wrong things. People talk about working on things. I don't like to work on things. I never like working on things. When I write, I don't work on it. I start, and I finish. If it don't come out in one long stream of consciousness, it ain't for me. I don't want to construct when I love, when I write. I don't want to go to couples therapy to solve a relationship. I don't want to work on it. I don't believe in it, never have.' Billy Bob had been with the actress Laura Dern for three years when she went off to make a movie. When she got back, Billy Bob was married to Angie. He knows that lots of people out here are sympathetic to Dern's side of things. 'Others may say that you left our girl and married someone else,' he says. 'But it made me happy and somebody else happy. I'm sorry it caused pain.' As the evening unwinds and the foot traffic slows down, Billy Bob chain-smokes and drinks bottles of water and hangs out, talking about All the Pretty Horses and his idea of the movies. He finished the film some time ago but continues to edit, tweak and fight battles over every little thing. He went to test screenings. He knows the audience out there is finicky. 'You've got people who only want to see someone screw an apple pie. But some people are sick and tired of it. They want raw stuff again. We did the movie the way they used to do it.' All the Pretty Horses is a modern epic, with 'interiors out of Sling Blade ' and 'outdoors that look like John Ford', with a big budget and big stars, directed by a guy who's never been trusted with more than a few million dollars before. 'I think the natural tendency these days is to use one of the big guys to direct. I'm not one of them.' Out of nowhere, someone asks, 'When are you going to London?' Billy Bob's fear of flying is famous. Before he gets on a plane, he'll call his mother, who is psychic, to ask her if it's safe. He'll go over there on one condition, he says - if Angie'll take him on the Jack the Ripper tour. It's quiet for a minute, and then Billy Bob speaks. 'You know she won't do anything to hurt me, because she knows it'll hurt her more,' he says. Billy Bob orders more cigarettes and gets up to pee. As he's walking back, he's already talking. He seems excited, maybe exercised. 'Did you ever look at a woman when she's asleep, and you think, who the fuck is that ?' he says, and sits down. 'And, like, the moonlight's coming in when you're sleeping next to her at night and you can kind of see her face - and she looks like a fucking monster ? This might be somebody you have been with for years. And you look at her, and it's like, who in God's name is that? Why - she's a stranger. What is she doing here? I don't even know her. And much of the daytime, you're like, \"Oh, honey, I love you. Are you OK? How was that today?\" But when she's asleep, that's how you really feel about her.' 8pm, same night Billy Bob bleeds [St Louise] Cardinal red, but the Dodgers will do for tonight. He got good tickets and decided to catch a game. Back in Malvern, Arkansas, Billy Bob was a hometown baseball hero, the promising kid who got a major league try-out at 18, got nailed by a bad throw, and broke his collarbone. 'There's nothing in the movies or entertainment that feels like the third pitch that strikes a guy out,' he says. Billy Bob remembers that his father hung a tyre up in the yard so that he could practise his pitching. 'It's the one place my dad and I connected every now and then,' he says. He looks around Dodger Stadium, shrugs his shoulders, and squints. 'Or maybe that's my fantasy.' Billy Bob was not close to his father. Billy Ray Thornton was gone a lot, teaching and coaching mostly basketball at small high schools out of town. Billy Bob says that every film he does is reckoning with his father. 'In my movies, there's either shitty fathers, absent fathers, fathers that you want their approval. Or the father's just not there. He died or whatever.' After the game, Billy Bob's in the car talking on the phone to his most recent ex-wife, Pietra, with whom he has two young sons. 'Don't make any plans for Friday night. We can make a dessert like strawberry shortcake or something like that.' He's sweet and kind to her now. It's late, but his kids aren't asleep. One of his boys announces over the phone that he's trying to kill a spider. 'Your mom ripped his body off? Wait, what - the spider's on his back, shivering with a chicken bone in his mouth? Well, that's a huge spider. Oh, that's the dog. OK, honey, did your mom tell you that I'm coming Friday night and we're gonna cook? We're gonna make something, just you and your brother and me and your mom. You sure are, baby, you are the luckiest boy. I love you. Goodnight, baby.' 1am, first night The house is rockin', sort of. In the one finished room, Billy Bob's trying to convince Odessa, his young assistant, that he always wanted to 'fuck a midget'. 'I always wanted to fuck a midget,' he tells her in earnest. 'I just wanted to see what it was like. I don't any more. But didn't you ever want to?' 'No!' Odessa yelps in a slurry North Carolina accent. She's 25, pretty, and has worked with Billy Bob for a couple of years. 'I always wanted to just pick them up by the ankles,' Billy Bob goes on. 'Think of all the things you could do with 'em. You can pick 'em up, turn 'em upside down by their ankles.' He holds up an imaginary midget, shakes it a little. Then he's slow dancing, loving the midget up and down. Odessa backs off a bit. Kristin, another assistant, is on the couch with Odessa's pit bull, Percy, giggling. 'I've seen midgets fucking,' Billy Bob says. 'You've seen it?' Odessa asks. 'Of course!' he says 'What do you mean, of course ? Like everybody has?' 'Not like everybody else has,' he says. 'Like I have.' 'I don't ever want to see that,' Odessa says. 'It's just wrong.' Marty Stuart comes whistling up from the studio. 'More bubbly?' Billy Bob asks, cackling. He's broken out champagne, ecstatic that he wrote a new song tonight. And that's as good a reason as any to make this night the first party in the new house. 'Slash had a room full of iguanas over there.' Billy Bob points past the bar. 'Man, I can't stand a lizard. I don't like that skin, I don't like the way they look.' Percy the pit bull ambles over and rubs against Billy Bob's leg. The dog's got a long, mean scar on his back. Odessa rescued him from somewhere up in the Hollywood Hills. It's one of the things Billy likes about Odessa, that her heart's so big. Another thing is that she genuinely doesn't seem to know or care who's famous and who's not, except for the day she saw Rhea Perlman [Carla from Cheers ] on the street and just about lost it. 'Marty and I were talking today,' Billy Bob says, 'about how in the South it's all right to beat a dog.' He and Marty are trying to work each other up. 'It's a kind of a way of life,' Marty says. Both men are laughing, their shoulders shaking. 'There's a place in Nashville,' Marty says. 'where you could get braces for your dog's teeth. The dog dentist. If your dog had buckteeth, you could get him braces.' 'Oh, well, that's just ridiculous,' Odessa says. 'Not if you're a buck-toothed dog!' Billy Bob says. Ime Etuk walks in, a soft-spoken black man in his twenties. Ime's an assistant director around town and Billy Bob's bowling buddy. 'You got a marijuana cigarette?' Billy Bob asks Ime. 'Not on me,' Ime says. Billy Bob is happy and loose, and he wants to have fun. He wants to have fun like Sinatra did, all night and whatever the hell he wanted. He can't wait for the house to be up and running so that he can get a little of that Southern Rat Pack feeling. A pool table, table football, and a Velcro room of his own design. 'Where are all my bitches?' Billy Bob cries out. 'I know I have more bitches than this! Odessa, call people! Tell 'em to come over!' 'We tried to call everybody,' Kristin says. 'We told them it was a pyjama party.' 'What's wrong with the world?' Billy Bob says. 'Everybody's tired,' Kristin says. 'Well I'm tired, too .' Alex, Billy Bob's chef, shows up, along with a blonde actress and a producer and a guy in a suit. Alex says that during the filming of All the Pretty Horses, she had to call Arkansas to 'find out from his momma how to make chocolate gravy and biscuits'. Billy Bob veers into a story about the night he saw a man barking his ass off in a grocery store. This was in Santa Fe late at night, after a day of shooting All the Pretty Horses , when Billy Bob and a couple of the girls were looking for a midnight snack. 'We've always been addicted to various kinds of cereal,' Billy Bob says. 'Cap'n Crunch!' Odessa says. 'Golden Grahams!' Kristin says. 'There was a guy there barking his ass off, just throwing his head back, doing the whole thing. I love that shit. I love that shit!' The party never becomes more than Ime, Marty, a couple of girls, and a dog on the couch. It's a work night. The girls want to go home. Billy Bob's got a joke. Won't they stay to hear it? 'So Bubba and Marcel decide they're going to go back to school...' He turns to Odessa. 'You know this one right?' 'No!' Her voice is rising now, a little irritated. 'I don't know what you're talking about.' Billy Bob looks at her. 'I'll call you in the morning,' she says. 'Will you call me at 5.30am?' Billy Bob asks gently. 'And again at 6am? I need like nine wake-up calls.' The girls are gone. 'It's a holy day,' Billy Bob says softly. 'Elvis died today.' When Billy Bob was two, his mother took him out to the highway to watch as the King's bus passed by their little town. They stood there by the road, waving. He stretches out on the couch, his physical depletion starting to show. His enthusiasm is faltering. He seems tamed. 'I know I'm compulsive,' he says. 'I'm hungry for the horrible shit, but I can't do that. Not any more. I got something good, and I'm not gonna mess it up.' It's quite late, going on 2am, and he's tired and ruminative all of a sudden. He's thinking about his father. 'Some of the things he loved are things I love, even though he and I didn't know each other or get along. And I have some of his traits.' He says that when his father got upset, he'd go away, disappear. 'That's me, too,' he says. His voice is rasping. Some involuntary twitches. Sometimes he gets so tired that his face starts to twitch. He'll blink his eyes and his whole face seems to blink. He just doesn't have the reserves he had when he was young. 'But my father didn't like music,' he says. 'At all. He might be the only man I ever met who didn't like music. There were two songs he liked - \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"Easter Parade\". It seemed incongruous.' He's talking so softly now, almost whispering. 'One's about the magic and wonder of childhood and the hard, cold facts about loss, and the other one is a celebration with hats.' He begins to hum, closing his eyes, and then he sings softly: In your Easter bonnet/With all the frills upon it/You'll be the grandest lady/In the Easter parade. He wants to go downstairs. He wants Ime to hear the new song he wrote, 'Beauty at the Back Door'. They follow the arrow down the stairs into Slash's Snakepit, where Marty and Jim, the engineer, are behind the glass. Ime and Billy Bob sit on the little couch. It's a song about screen doors and myrtle bushes and love, about memory and desire and loss. A little slide guitar, but mostly Billy Bob's voice. It's a spoken-word song, raw, stripped down, a Southern-gothic Leonard Cohen. 'My, that's a snappy western shirt you got on,' Billy Bob says to Marty faintly. 'You goin' to a singin'?' 'Yeah, I'm going to a singin',' Marty says. And then Billy Bob sings another song, called 'Poison Honey'. His voice is smoky. She draws me in like a moth to a flame/And sometimes at night, I call out her name. 'Albums are supposed to reflect what's going on in your life,' Marty says. Billy Bob laughs. 'Then I'm fucked.' There's darkness all around, as the evening shadows fall/Time keeps dragging by, but she ain't coming home at all. Billy Bob listens to the music, his fingers touching his lips. He likes the song, likes where it's going. He crosses his legs, gets comfortable. His eyelids slip down, shut, open, shut. In a few weeks, he'll have run himself down so bad that he'll be in the hospital. But for now, he's got to be up in a few hours, working. His cough will become bronchitis, and an infection will inflame his heart. But in the morning, the extras will be waiting for haircuts. Angie will rush from London to his side. But for now, he folds his hands, nestles them between his knees. The doctor will tell him, 'You know, Billy Bob, you don't have to starve yourself and not sleep.' And Billy Bob, in a burst of light, will promise himself to go on living. But now his shoulders hunch. The music sounds good, like a dream from childhood. His eyes close. Billy Bob Thornton is asleep. \u0095 All the Pretty Horses is released on 9 March, and The Gift will be released on 2 March.",

      "body": "<p><strong> POLITICS</strong><br> </p> <p> Although the single currency is most obviously an economic project, the political issues have proved particularly persuasive in public debate. This is hardly surprising since for centuries the national currency has been such a potent symbol of the nation state. </p> <p>There is widespread concern that giving up our own currency means surrendering our sovereignty and our ability to determine our own future as we see fit. Doesn't a single currency inevitably lead to a single European superstate? Nothing represents these concerns more than the question that the tabloids have often asked: what will it do to the Queen's head on our notes? </p> <p>These emotive issues are likely to be far more influential in a referendum than the relatively dry and arcane arguments about economics, as the Danish government found to its cost. It argued for joining the euro on largely economic grounds, only to have the public reject it in a referendum for political and cultural reasons. </p> <p><strong> Will the government lose control over our interest rates if we join?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> Interest rates will no longer be set in London by the Bank of England, but in Frankfurt by the European Central Bank. When the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets once a month to set rates, all its members consider is what is best for the UK. </p> <p>In contrast, the ECB committee is made up of unelected foreign central bankers who will easily out-vote the one British representative. They are appointed by foreign governments, and once appointed, politically unaccountable. When they discuss whether to raise or cut interest rates, they are meant to consider what is happening in the wider European economy - in particular Germany, the largest Euroland economy - with just a glance at Britain's needs. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> We don't have democratic independent control over our interest rates now - they are largely determined by economic developments in the global economy and by well-tried financial rules. </p> <p>If the European Central Bank raises interest rates, that puts extra pressure on the Bank of England to follow suit. Nor would it be less democratic in Euroland than it is now. </p> <p>Since the Labour government granted independence to the Bank of England in May 1997, politicians have had no say in Britain's interest rates. Instead they have been set by a committee of appointed bankers and economists (some of whom aren't even British). </p> <p>Almost all economists agree that with their technical expertise, ability to think long term and freedom from electoral pressures, central bankers are much better at setting interest rates to ensure stable and low inflation than politicians. </p> <p><strong> Will Brussels dictate our taxes? </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> The euro project is called EMU - Economic and Monetary Union. Its designers see unifying the currency as just the first step to unifying taxes, and for very powerful economic reasons. For the euro to work effectively, it requires strong co-ordination between interest rates and how governments tax and spend. It will not work if national governments repeatedly undermine the European Central Bank's interest-rate policy by altering taxes and changing spending. It will be as though the ECB is pressing the brake while the national governments are pushing down on their accelerators. </p> <p>To work effectively, the euro will require a large central budget to even out the adverse effects of the one-size-fits-all interest rate. This central fund will be needed to make booming regions bail out ailing ones. This large fund can only come from taxpayers. </p> <p>It is the official policy of both the European Commission and the European Parliament to harmonise taxes. If we join the euro, as well as the political and economic pressure to harmonise taxes, we will be accepting explicit and direct controls on how much the government can tax and spend, as a result of the Stability Pact. </p> <p>We saw the effect of this recently when the Commission chastised Ireland for not setting a strict enough budget. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> British tax levels and the issue of membership of the single currency are completely separate and totally unrelated. Britain retains a veto on tax issues in the Council of Ministers, the highest-level body in Brussels. If Britain doesn't want tax harmonisation, it simply will not happen. Brussels and most of our EU partners tried to force the UK to change our 'withholding tax' on savings, but we resisted. </p> <p>In any case, there is no need to harmonise taxes - indeed it would be a hindrance. If recession looms in one country, its government can kick-start its economy by cutting taxes or raising public spending of its own accord. This use of our national budget would enable a British government to stabilise our economy over the business cycle and counteract any adverse effects of the 'one-size-fits-all' interest rate. </p> <p><strong> Wouldn't it mean surrendering sovereignty?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> Joining the euro would involve a major surrendering of sovereignty, severely hindering our ability to run the economy as we see fit. We would lose control over interest rates and the ability to manage the economy through taxing and spending. Instead, it would be run by European committees. If we join the euro, we will be accepting direct and explicit legal constraints on the government's ability to tax and spend. </p> <p>If we were to go into recession, the government would no longer be allowed to spend its way out of it. Under the rules of the Stability Pact, we would not be allowed to have a budget deficit of more than 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and we would have to keep overall levels of public debt below 60 per cent of GDP. If we broke these rules, we would be subject to massive fines of billions of euros. </p> <p>Most leading bankers and politicians believe that for the euro to do well, most big economic decisions - such as those on taxation and spending - will have to be made centrally. The decision to set taxes and make decisions on public-spending priorities is central to any nation state. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> These constraints are there to stop any one country free-riding on the others and make sure they pay their own way. Not building up excessive national debts is something that countries should do anyway, for their own long-term wellbeing. </p> <p>Within those constraints, countries would be able to tax and spend in whatever way they like. They can pursue high-tax and high-spending policies (like France) or go for low tax and small government (like Ireland). </p> <p>When it comes to interest rates, we would in some ways get more sovereignty. Being represented in the European Central Bank would give us more influence, because we would be there as part of the decision-making process, not just having to accept decisions made by others that have a profound effect on us. </p> <p>We will be pooling our sovereignty, not losing it. Compare it with an individual person. If you were abandoned on a desert island, you would have total personal sovereignty to do exactly what you want. </p> <p>But you would still want to surrender that total sovereignty by coming back to civilisation - and all its laws and regulations - because that would be a small price to pay for the benefits of living with and co-operating with others. </p> <p><strong> Doesn't monetary union inevitably lead to political union?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> In Britain, politicians pretend that the euro is just a matter of economics, but in Europe politicians are open about the real agenda: the creation of a single European superstate. Many economists and central bankers say it will be essential if the euro is to succeed: there has been no example in history of a significant currency union without political union. Central bankers warn that the euro can succeed only if there is central control over policies of taxation and spending, and it isn't made up of nation states all pulling in different directions. The highly respected German Bundesbank issued two formal statements, in 1990 and 1992, saying that monetary union would be durable only if accompanied by political union. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> Britain has the right to veto any changes to the way Europe is run. The key decision-making body in Europe is the European Council, which consists of the elected heads of government of each member of the European Union. We can block any changes we don't like. </p> <p>History also proves that you can have monetary union without political union. The Irish Republic was in a currency union with the UK from 1921 to 1979 without becoming part of the UK. Brussels and Luxembourg had a successful currency union for many years while maintaining separate governments. </p> <p>In any case, integration of some sort shouldn't just be seen as a drawback. After a 70-year period when Europe went to war with itself three times, closer integration has ensured no war in western Europe for half a century. </p> <p><strong> CULTURE</strong><br> </p> <p> For Britain, it will mean ditching what is probably the oldest continuous currency in the world. The British have far more historical, cultural and political attachment to their currency than, say, the Irish have to the punt, which had only been established with the birth of the Republic, and uncoupled from the pound sterling since 1979, or the Italians to their wonderfully disappearing lira. </p> <p><strong> Wouldn't losing the pound mean losing an important national symbol?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> The pound sterling is a major national symbol for Britain. Since King Heabearth of Kent copied the monetary innovations of Charlemagne, and launched the pound in 765 AD, it has served us well for 1,200 years, through the Middle Ages, Empire and two world wars. It has spent much of its existence being the dominant currency of the global economy. </p> <p>It is as old as the language we speak, and has become part of our literature. 'In for a penny, in for a pound' doesn't sound quite the same as 'in for a cent, in for a euro'. Europe is already trying to get us to get rid of pounds and ounces, and now we are being told we have to get rid of pounds and pence. It is all part of the harmonisation imposed from Brussels, and the rubbing out of national differences. The loss of the pound will be a severe blow to British identity and culture. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> The pound has had a long history, but not always a proud one. It has lost more than 96 per cent of its value in the last century as it faltered and devalued and had to be rescued. The history of the pound also illustrates its changeable nature. It has spent most of its life being a purely notional currency, and only in 1489 did the pound come into physical existence with the launch of the gold sovereign. When paper currency was introduced in the nineteenth century, it caused uproar, with people declaring it immoral. And people protested about change when we got rid of shillings and decimalised the currency. </p> <p>Nor is it a significant part of our identity. If you ask people in the street what it means to be British, they are more likely to say the Queen, democracy, tolerance, a sense of humour, support for the underdog and football, than they are the pound coin. It is rather sad to insist that our national identity is so weak, that it depends on the coins in our pocket. The French would laugh at such an idea. </p> <p><strong> Would it mean the end of the Queen's head on our banknotes?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> The euro notes, standardised across Euroland, will not have the Queen's head on them. Originally, there was to be a space for a national emblem. But in a typical act of euro-harmonisation, this was ditched. They will now have the same design in every country. If we join, Eurocrats and foreign politicians will have succeeded where Hitler failed, in knocking the Queen's head off our notes. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> It is true that the Queen's head would not be on our euro notes - but Hitler could never have achieved this feat for the simple fact that we did not have the Queen's (or any monarch's) head on the notes until after the Second World War. The Queen's head has only been on the notes since 1960, and she still isn't on the notes in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In contrast, we have had the monarch's head on our coins since the Middle Ages, and that will continue. Countries in Euroland can put a national symbol - such as the Queen - on one side of each coin. </p> <p><strong> Won't it be confusing using new notes and coins?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> It will be far more confusing than decimalisation, when the prices in pounds stayed the same, and only the pence part changed. Then we kept the same notes, and many of the same coins. Adopting the euro would mean an entirely new set of prices, and a new coins and notes. Consumers would suffer a double whammy of confusion, with the changeover coming shortly after shopkeepers had to change from weighing things in pounds and ounces to kilos and grammes. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> Any confusion will be reduced by a period of dual pricing - where shops show prices in both currencies - followed by a period of dual circulation, with both coins in use at the same time. This will give customers sufficient time to get used to both the new prices and new coinage. It is a short-term, one-off effect which will quickly be overcome. When people go on holiday, even the most financially illiterate feel at home with a new currency within a few weeks, and it will be the same with the euro. </p> <p><strong> SHOULD WE JOIN?</strong><br> </p> <p> Even the most passionate Eurosceptics and Europhiles concede that there are strong arguments for and against joining. People tend to want to become part of the euro on the grounds of economic arguments, and want to stay out of it for political ones: but what matters more, politics or economics? Even within the realm of economics, there are clear benefits and costs to either course of action. Then there are also questions of timing, of whether the euro is successful, and if we join, can we get out if we don't like it? If the euro were to show signs of falling to pieces, it is unlikely that a British government would try to take us in. Shouldn't we just put aside all these academic arguments, wait and see whether the euro works, see how we do outside it, and then decide? Or will that leave us permanently behind the rest of Europe? Many of these answers are a matter of opinion; some issues will matter more to some people than others. But, having considered all the issues, the ultimate question you must ask yourself is: do the benefits of joining and the costs of remaining outside the Eurozone outweigh the costs of joining and the benefits of remaining outside? Or not?</p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,439386,00.html\">How to make sense of the euro debate - part 1</a></p> <p><strong>Related story</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,439505,00.html\">Focus: We can love the euro - I proved it</a></p>",

Not that, for the most part, there was much that visitors could take exception to.

      "body": "<p>It's as important a decision as it is difficult. Tony Blair has promised that if he wins the coming election he will decide within two years whether to have a referendum, while William Hague has ruled it out. Last week, the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, raised the stakes, coming to Britain to tell us we will lose out if we don't join in. </p> <p>We are, quite simply, being asked to decide whether to get rid of the pound and join Europe's new single currency, the euro. </p> <p>It will probably be the most important economic and political decision Britain will have to make in the first half of the twenty-first century. It won't just affect the economy and businesses, but everyone old enough to have pocket money. </p> <p>Yet survey after survey has shown that most British people feel too ill-informed to make an educated decision. This is in sharp contrast to Denmark, where citizens generally felt very well informed about it before rejecting it narrowly in a referendum. </p> <p>Tonight's Referendum Street programme (BBC1) shows just how big an effect hearing the different arguments about the euro has on people's attitudes to it. </p> <p>The danger is that in Britain we make the wrong decision for the wrong reasons and regret it later at great cost. It could lead to greater prosperity, lower inflation, more jobs and greater national influence. Or it could lead to higher unemployment, failing businesses and a loss of national sovereignty. </p> <p>It is a debate of daunting complexity, with powerful arguments both for and against joining. To help readers make up their own minds, The Observer is publishing extracts from a new book, The Euro - Should Britain Join: Yes or No? Written by Anthony Browne, who covered the launch of the euro for The Observer, it sets out for the first time answers to all the most common questions, giving both the pro-euro and anti-euro arguments. </p> <p>The book covers the effects not just on business, the economy and our sovereignty, but on personal finances, mortgages, pensions, house prices and the cost of holidays. Here we publish edited answers to some of the questions that are dominating the current political debate. </p> <p><strong> THE ECONOMY</strong><br> </p> <p> The single currency - the merging of national currencies - is most obviously an economic project. It directly affects our exchange rate and interest rates and, indirectly, jobs, trade, investment and economic growth. It is in this realm that the intellectual battle for and against the euro is fought out most intensely in the UK. Since Britain's economic cycle has historically been out of phase with those in mainland Europe, the economic issues are particularly thorny for us. In contrast, the economies of Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria were already so closely tied to that of Germany that the economic issues arising from uniting the currency as well were less significant. </p> <p><strong> Do we really want the same interest rates as the rest of Europe?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> The main danger of the euro is the 'one-size-fits-all' interest rate, imposed across the continent from Ireland to Austria, Portugal to Finland, by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. If our economy is ever out of step with Euroland, that interest rate will be wrong for us and we will return to a boom and bust scenario. For example, if Germany and France are booming while we are in recession, the high interest rates needed to stop them overheating will deepen our economic plight. </p> <p>Because the British economy is so out of step with those of mainland Europe, we will suffer particularly badly. This has already happened to Ireland. It overheated and had an explosive property market because it had low German-level interest rates in the middle of an economic boom. </p> <p>Joining the euro may mean greater stability for our currency, but it will replace it with interest rates that are inappropriate for the state of the economy. </p> <p> <strong> Yes</strong> The world's most successful economy - with about the same population as Euroland - has just one interest rate, set in Washington. In the US, they positively thrive with the same interest rate set stretching from Hawaii to Florida, Alaska to Texas. When California is booming and Tennessee's in recession, for example, they manage to cope with one currency and one interest rate. Britain can have an independent interest rate only if we also have a currency that is free to fluctuate - and the volatility of the pound causes great economic problems. </p> <p> <strong> No but </strong> The US thrives with one interest rate only because in the US people move far more easily to look for work, and because they have huge financial transfers from rich to poor areas. When Tennessee is in recession, it doesn't suffer permanent high unemployment because huge numbers of workers will move to booming California in search of work. The different cultures and languages mean it is simply unrealistic to think unemployed Portuguese will move to Finland for work, or that people from Newcastle will move to Milan. </p> <p>At the same time, the increased taxes paid in booming California would be used to prop up ailing Tennessee through huge federal transfers, which we don't have between countries in Europe. If we suffer recession while Germany is booming, we will be lumbered with high interest rates, no financial lifeboat, and our workers wouldn't be able to move to Germany to find work, because they don't speak German. </p> <p> <strong> Yes, but </strong> More labour mobility would definitely be an advantage, but people in Europe don't even move around within countries in search of work - for example southern Italians are reluctant go to work in the north of the country - and we have learnt to cope with the consequences through such things as regional development funds. The government can always fine-tune the economy by altering tax and spending. </p> <p><strong> Isn't our economy out of step with Europe?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> There have been several occasions in the past 30 years where Britain has been in recession when Europe is booming, and vice versa. Our economy is out of step with that of mainland Europe partly because we have much closer ties with North America than they do. More than half our trade goes outside Euroland, and most of our trade is done in dollars. </p> <p>Over the past three economic cycles, the British economy has moved more closely in line with that of the US than with Europe's. Evidence of this is that since the pound fell out of the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, it has remained relatively stable against the dollar, but very volatile against European currencies. </p> <p>In contrast, countries on the European mainland do a higher proportion of trade with each other, and their economies are far more integrated. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> Britain's economy has been converging with that of mainland Europe since the late Nineties. The proportion of our trade with Europe has been growing since the creation of the single market in 1992. The UK and other European countries with high government budget deficits have managed to get them under control, so that all EU governments are now living within their means. The independence of the Bank of England has helped defeat our inflationary habit, and brought interest rates down towards European levels. Most analysts now say that our economy is the closest it has been to Europe's for more than 30 years. What is more, once we join the euro, we are very unlikely then to get out of step, because enhanced trade and investment will tie us even closer. </p> <p><strong> Will joining solve the problem of the volatile pound?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> Obviously, if we joined the euro, we would have the same currency as our main trading partners - in the Eurozone - and the problem of a pound that bounces up and down would be ended at a stroke. It would help create certainty for exporters and importers, who have been ravaged by the unpredictability of our currency. </p> <p>Britain is very vulnerable to these currency movements because we are a medium-sized economy heavily dependent on imports and exports. If we stay outside the euro, the pound will remain torn between the euro and the dollar, strongly connected to both but not protected by either. The pound would be torn apart like a child trying to hold on to both its parents while they walk in different directions. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> Half of our trade and two-thirds of our investment are with the rest of the world outside Euroland. Most of our exports are traded in dollars. This is why the pound has been relatively stable against the dollar. However, the euro has been very volatile against the dollar, so locking the pound to the euro would actually mean more currency instability for the majority of our exporters, not less. </p> <p>In any case, a floating exchange rate is one of the economic safety valves - along with public spending and interest rates - that can help it to adjust in the global economy. Having an independent exchange rate allows us to compensate for differences in inflation and productivity, and can help boost our economy if we end up in recession. </p> <p><strong> Will joining the euro boost trade?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> By joining the euro we will be joining the largest single market in the world outside the US. This will enable businesses to sell more widely, achieving greater economies of scale. It will also enable families and businesses to buy from a wider, and so cheaper, range of suppliers. Both of these will boost trade and increase our prosperity. Having a stable exchange rate with our biggest trading partner - Euroland - will eliminate uncertainties and so boost trade further. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> Most trade barriers were abolished with the creation of the European single market in 1992, and having the same currency will make little extra difference. Businesses can already buy from suppliers in different countries, and exchange costs are marginal. We have access to the market, but we avoid the disadvantages of inappropriate interest rates that come with being part of it. </p> <p>In any case, the trade that we pay for in dollars will suffer if we join the euro, because the euro is so volatile against the dollar. </p> <p><strong> Will the euro push up inflation? </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> In recent years, the Bank of England has proved very successful at controlling inflation. Britain is no longer the high-inflation capital of Europe, but has inflation at a similarly low level to Germany and France. However, if we join the euro we will be forced to use European interest rates, which have generally been much lower than British ones, inevitably leading to an inflationary boom. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> There will be long-term downward forces on prices that are far more powerful than the effect of low interest rates. More trade and stronger competition will keep prices in check. One of the most important influences will be 'price transparency'. With goods in the same currency here as the rest of Euroland, it will be far easier to directly compare prices. When shoppers in 'rip-off Britain' can so easily see they are being charged more, they will become far more demanding about getting the same low prices as mainland Europe. The creation of an enormous single market the size of the US will lead to economies of scale in production that will bring prices down still further. High levels of competition, price transparency and increased trade will force expensive companies to bring prices down to the lowest level. </p> <p><strong> Isn't the British economy thriving outside the euro?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> It is the world's fourth-largest economy, in the best condition it has been in for generations. Britain's flexible labour market and low taxation helped push unemployment and inflation to the lowest level for a generation. After the boom and bust of the Seventies, Eighties and early Nineties, we at last have long-term economic stability. Joining the euro will be a profound shock to the economy, which will threaten all we have achieved. As a low-tax, flexible economy off the coast of mainland Europe, we are proving increasingly attractive to foreign investors. Staying out will give us the best of both worlds. We are in the single market, but outside the euro. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> Britain has done very well before the creation of the euro, but the world has moved on. The single currency - and the world's second-largest single market - is now a fact of life, it's on our doorstep, and we're not part of it. We may be the world's fourth-largest economy, but we are now dwarfed by a neighbour that is rapidly reorganising itself and becoming more competitive. The ground rules have changed. The impact of our exclusion was muted in the first couple of years by the Labour government's hints that we would join soon, encouraging foreign investors to hold firm. </p> <p><strong> BUSINESS</strong><br> </p> <p> Joining the euro will affect everyone, but businesses will be in the front line. Importers and exporters will be greatly affected by the merging of our currency with Europe's. All businesses will have to make changes, from the accounts department to the tills, and will be indirectly affected by the changes in interest rates. It is for this reason that groups such as the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, and the Trades Union Congress have such a vested interest in the debate. </p> <p><strong> Will foreign investors be put off and jobs be lost if we stay out?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> Staying out will lead to the loss of thousands of jobs as foreign investors stay away and British businesses become relatively uncompetitive compared with their Euroland rivals. Without access to the single currency zone, foreign investors who are here will move out, closing factories and businesses; new ones will set up in Euroland in preference to the UK. </p> <p>Many multinationals have warned Tony Blair they will invest elsewhere unless he gives a commitment to join the euro. The huge economies of scale of the vast single market of Euroland will enable them to produce more goods at lower prices, undercutting British companies at home and abroad. As British companies lose out, so will their workers. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> Joining the euro would damage the British economy - with one-size-fits-all interest rates - and destroy jobs. It is being part of the European Union single market rather than the euro that ensures trade and employment. The evidence speaks for itself. Britain's unemployment carried on falling, and foreign investment rose to record levels, after the launch of the euro. In the Nineties, Britain has created more jobs than all the other Euroland countries put together. Two years after the launch of the euro, Euroland has unemployment about twice as high as the UK, which is enjoying its lowest unemployment for a quarter of a century. </p> <p><strong> Won't converting to the euro be very expensive for shops and other businesses?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> Cashpoints, tills and vending machines will all have to be changed or simply bought anew. Accounting systems will have to be switched, and staff will have to be trained. The British Retail Consortium estimates that it would cost shops \u00a33.5 billion, and amount to almost 3 per cent of turnover for small shops. The Federation of Small Businesses reckons that for most of its members, conversion will cost up to \u00a35,000 - a substantial sum for a small company. </p> <p> <strong> No </strong> It is a one-off cost that will not be repeated. Much of the cost will just be a case of bringing forward an investment (changing to the next-generation cashpoint earlier) rather than a whole new cost. In any case, much of British business is having to convert its operations to the euro even if Britain stays out. Many exporters are now having to price their goods in euros rather than pounds when they pitch for sales in Euroland. </p> <p><strong> Will the City of London lose its position as Europe's financial centre if we stay out?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Yes </strong> The European Central Bank - the second most powerful in the world - had a natural home in London, but ended up in Frankfurt because of our indecision over the euro.

      "bodyText": "It's as important a decision as it is difficult. Tony Blair has promised that if he wins the coming election he will decide within two years whether to have a referendum, while William Hague has ruled it out. Last week, the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, raised the stakes, coming to Britain to tell us we will lose out if we don't join in. We are, quite simply, being asked to decide whether to get rid of the pound and join Europe's new single currency, the euro. It will probably be the most important economic and political decision Britain will have to make in the first half of the twenty-first century. It won't just affect the economy and businesses, but everyone old enough to have pocket money. Yet survey after survey has shown that most British people feel too ill-informed to make an educated decision. This is in sharp contrast to Denmark, where citizens generally felt very well informed about it before rejecting it narrowly in a referendum. Tonight's Referendum Street programme (BBC1) shows just how big an effect hearing the different arguments about the euro has on people's attitudes to it. The danger is that in Britain we make the wrong decision for the wrong reasons and regret it later at great cost. It could lead to greater prosperity, lower inflation, more jobs and greater national influence. Or it could lead to higher unemployment, failing businesses and a loss of national sovereignty. It is a debate of daunting complexity, with powerful arguments both for and against joining. To help readers make up their own minds, The Observer is publishing extracts from a new book, The Euro - Should Britain Join: Yes or No? Written by Anthony Browne, who covered the launch of the euro for The Observer, it sets out for the first time answers to all the most common questions, giving both the pro-euro and anti-euro arguments. The book covers the effects not just on business, the economy and our sovereignty, but on personal finances, mortgages, pensions, house prices and the cost of holidays. Here we publish edited answers to some of the questions that are dominating the current political debate. THE ECONOMY The single currency - the merging of national currencies - is most obviously an economic project. It directly affects our exchange rate and interest rates and, indirectly, jobs, trade, investment and economic growth. It is in this realm that the intellectual battle for and against the euro is fought out most intensely in the UK. Since Britain's economic cycle has historically been out of phase with those in mainland Europe, the economic issues are particularly thorny for us. In contrast, the economies of Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria were already so closely tied to that of Germany that the economic issues arising from uniting the currency as well were less significant. Do we really want the same interest rates as the rest of Europe? No The main danger of the euro is the 'one-size-fits-all' interest rate, imposed across the continent from Ireland to Austria, Portugal to Finland, by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. If our economy is ever out of step with Euroland, that interest rate will be wrong for us and we will return to a boom and bust scenario. For example, if Germany and France are booming while we are in recession, the high interest rates needed to stop them overheating will deepen our economic plight. Because the British economy is so out of step with those of mainland Europe, we will suffer particularly badly. This has already happened to Ireland. It overheated and had an explosive property market because it had low German-level interest rates in the middle of an economic boom. Joining the euro may mean greater stability for our currency, but it will replace it with interest rates that are inappropriate for the state of the economy. Yes The world's most successful economy - with about the same population as Euroland - has just one interest rate, set in Washington. In the US, they positively thrive with the same interest rate set stretching from Hawaii to Florida, Alaska to Texas. When California is booming and Tennessee's in recession, for example, they manage to cope with one currency and one interest rate. Britain can have an independent interest rate only if we also have a currency that is free to fluctuate - and the volatility of the pound causes great economic problems. No but The US thrives with one interest rate only because in the US people move far more easily to look for work, and because they have huge financial transfers from rich to poor areas. When Tennessee is in recession, it doesn't suffer permanent high unemployment because huge numbers of workers will move to booming California in search of work. The different cultures and languages mean it is simply unrealistic to think unemployed Portuguese will move to Finland for work, or that people from Newcastle will move to Milan. At the same time, the increased taxes paid in booming California would be used to prop up ailing Tennessee through huge federal transfers, which we don't have between countries in Europe. If we suffer recession while Germany is booming, we will be lumbered with high interest rates, no financial lifeboat, and our workers wouldn't be able to move to Germany to find work, because they don't speak German. Yes, but More labour mobility would definitely be an advantage, but people in Europe don't even move around within countries in search of work - for example southern Italians are reluctant go to work in the north of the country - and we have learnt to cope with the consequences through such things as regional development funds. The government can always fine-tune the economy by altering tax and spending. Isn't our economy out of step with Europe? Yes There have been several occasions in the past 30 years where Britain has been in recession when Europe is booming, and vice versa. Our economy is out of step with that of mainland Europe partly because we have much closer ties with North America than they do. More than half our trade goes outside Euroland, and most of our trade is done in dollars. Over the past three economic cycles, the British economy has moved more closely in line with that of the US than with Europe's. Evidence of this is that since the pound fell out of the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, it has remained relatively stable against the dollar, but very volatile against European currencies. In contrast, countries on the European mainland do a higher proportion of trade with each other, and their economies are far more integrated. No Britain's economy has been converging with that of mainland Europe since the late Nineties. The proportion of our trade with Europe has been growing since the creation of the single market in 1992. The UK and other European countries with high government budget deficits have managed to get them under control, so that all EU governments are now living within their means. The independence of the Bank of England has helped defeat our inflationary habit, and brought interest rates down towards European levels. Most analysts now say that our economy is the closest it has been to Europe's for more than 30 years. What is more, once we join the euro, we are very unlikely then to get out of step, because enhanced trade and investment will tie us even closer. Will joining solve the problem of the volatile pound? Yes Obviously, if we joined the euro, we would have the same currency as our main trading partners - in the Eurozone - and the problem of a pound that bounces up and down would be ended at a stroke. It would help create certainty for exporters and importers, who have been ravaged by the unpredictability of our currency. Britain is very vulnerable to these currency movements because we are a medium-sized economy heavily dependent on imports and exports. If we stay outside the euro, the pound will remain torn between the euro and the dollar, strongly connected to both but not protected by either. The pound would be torn apart like a child trying to hold on to both its parents while they walk in different directions. No Half of our trade and two-thirds of our investment are with the rest of the world outside Euroland. Most of our exports are traded in dollars. This is why the pound has been relatively stable against the dollar. However, the euro has been very volatile against the dollar, so locking the pound to the euro would actually mean more currency instability for the majority of our exporters, not less. In any case, a floating exchange rate is one of the economic safety valves - along with public spending and interest rates - that can help it to adjust in the global economy. Having an independent exchange rate allows us to compensate for differences in inflation and productivity, and can help boost our economy if we end up in recession. Will joining the euro boost trade? Yes By joining the euro we will be joining the largest single market in the world outside the US. This will enable businesses to sell more widely, achieving greater economies of scale. It will also enable families and businesses to buy from a wider, and so cheaper, range of suppliers. Both of these will boost trade and increase our prosperity. Having a stable exchange rate with our biggest trading partner - Euroland - will eliminate uncertainties and so boost trade further. No Most trade barriers were abolished with the creation of the European single market in 1992, and having the same currency will make little extra difference. Businesses can already buy from suppliers in different countries, and exchange costs are marginal. We have access to the market, but we avoid the disadvantages of inappropriate interest rates that come with being part of it. In any case, the trade that we pay for in dollars will suffer if we join the euro, because the euro is so volatile against the dollar. Will the euro push up inflation? Yes In recent years, the Bank of England has proved very successful at controlling inflation. Britain is no longer the high-inflation capital of Europe, but has inflation at a similarly low level to Germany and France. However, if we join the euro we will be forced to use European interest rates, which have generally been much lower than British ones, inevitably leading to an inflationary boom. No There will be long-term downward forces on prices that are far more powerful than the effect of low interest rates. More trade and stronger competition will keep prices in check. One of the most important influences will be 'price transparency'. With goods in the same currency here as the rest of Euroland, it will be far easier to directly compare prices. When shoppers in 'rip-off Britain' can so easily see they are being charged more, they will become far more demanding about getting the same low prices as mainland Europe. The creation of an enormous single market the size of the US will lead to economies of scale in production that will bring prices down still further. High levels of competition, price transparency and increased trade will force expensive companies to bring prices down to the lowest level. Isn't the British economy thriving outside the euro? Yes It is the world's fourth-largest economy, in the best condition it has been in for generations. Britain's flexible labour market and low taxation helped push unemployment and inflation to the lowest level for a generation. After the boom and bust of the Seventies, Eighties and early Nineties, we at last have long-term economic stability. Joining the euro will be a profound shock to the economy, which will threaten all we have achieved. As a low-tax, flexible economy off the coast of mainland Europe, we are proving increasingly attractive to foreign investors. Staying out will give us the best of both worlds. We are in the single market, but outside the euro. No Britain has done very well before the creation of the euro, but the world has moved on. The single currency - and the world's second-largest single market - is now a fact of life, it's on our doorstep, and we're not part of it. We may be the world's fourth-largest economy, but we are now dwarfed by a neighbour that is rapidly reorganising itself and becoming more competitive. The ground rules have changed. The impact of our exclusion was muted in the first couple of years by the Labour government's hints that we would join soon, encouraging foreign investors to hold firm. BUSINESS Joining the euro will affect everyone, but businesses will be in the front line. Importers and exporters will be greatly affected by the merging of our currency with Europe's. All businesses will have to make changes, from the accounts department to the tills, and will be indirectly affected by the changes in interest rates. It is for this reason that groups such as the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, and the Trades Union Congress have such a vested interest in the debate. Will foreign investors be put off and jobs be lost if we stay out? Yes Staying out will lead to the loss of thousands of jobs as foreign investors stay away and British businesses become relatively uncompetitive compared with their Euroland rivals. Without access to the single currency zone, foreign investors who are here will move out, closing factories and businesses; new ones will set up in Euroland in preference to the UK. Many multinationals have warned Tony Blair they will invest elsewhere unless he gives a commitment to join the euro. The huge economies of scale of the vast single market of Euroland will enable them to produce more goods at lower prices, undercutting British companies at home and abroad. As British companies lose out, so will their workers. No Joining the euro would damage the British economy - with one-size-fits-all interest rates - and destroy jobs. It is being part of the European Union single market rather than the euro that ensures trade and employment. The evidence speaks for itself. Britain's unemployment carried on falling, and foreign investment rose to record levels, after the launch of the euro. In the Nineties, Britain has created more jobs than all the other Euroland countries put together. Two years after the launch of the euro, Euroland has unemployment about twice as high as the UK, which is enjoying its lowest unemployment for a quarter of a century. Won't converting to the euro be very expensive for shops and other businesses? Yes Cashpoints, tills and vending machines will all have to be changed or simply bought anew. Accounting systems will have to be switched, and staff will have to be trained. The British Retail Consortium estimates that it would cost shops \u00a33.5 billion, and amount to almost 3 per cent of turnover for small shops. The Federation of Small Businesses reckons that for most of its members, conversion will cost up to \u00a35,000 - a substantial sum for a small company. No It is a one-off cost that will not be repeated. Much of the cost will just be a case of bringing forward an investment (changing to the next-generation cashpoint earlier) rather than a whole new cost. In any case, much of British business is having to convert its operations to the euro even if Britain stays out. Many exporters are now having to price their goods in euros rather than pounds when they pitch for sales in Euroland. Will the City of London lose its position as Europe's financial centre if we stay out? Yes The European Central Bank - the second most powerful in the world - had a natural home in London, but ended up in Frankfurt because of our indecision over the euro. This success reinvigorated Germany's bid to ensure that Frankfurt becomes Europe's financial centre, with a massive office-building programme to rival that going on in London's Docklands. Both Frankfurt and Paris are open about trying to stimulate the virtuous circle of success that has taken London to pre-eminence, and their determination would undoubtedly increase if it became clear that Britain's absence from the euro was to be permanent. No This scare-mongering - prevalent at the time of the euro's launch - has simply not been borne out by events, which show that the launch of the euro has actually consolidated London's number-one position. Lord Levene, the Lord Mayor of London at the launch of the euro, used to warn about the threat to London, but the evidence was so overwhelming that he quickly changed tune. Indeed, London's rivals have suffered a bloody nose because the centralising effect of the single currency means that what were effectively regional financial centres - such as Paris - lost any reason for their existence, and saw all the European business drain away to Europe's real financial centre, London.

      "body": "<p>Arise Sir Jimmy Goldsmith, you have a worthy successor. Sierra Trading, a secretive US 'vulture fund' that targets underperformers, has been cast as a villain in the mould of the worst corporate raiders. </p> <p>And if it is allowed to get away with its antics - which, it must be stressed, are perfectly legal - Britain might yet import some of the nastiest, dirtiest corporate tactics, that ravaged the United States in the 1980s, but have now been all but stamped out across the Atlantic. Or so predicts Hermes, one of the City's most powerful institutions with more than \u00a350 billion to spend. </p> <p>However, the real target of Hermes' spleen is Scottish Investment Trust (SIT), run by some of Scotland's biggest movers and shakers. According to Hermes, SIT has made a pact with the devil. Worse, its blue-blooded chairman, the venerable Sir Angus Grossart, has dismissed Hermes' concerns with a patrician flick of the wrist. In doing so, he has turned the spotlight on the cosy, tight-knit Edinburgh financial community and the olde worlde sector of investment trusts, which the Scots dominate. </p> <p>'What is odd about this industry is that it is run for itself. Boards are just stuffed with worthies,' says an agitated David Pitt-Watson, the commercial director of Hermes Lens Asset management, an Anglo-US joint venture set up quietly three years ago to shake up complacent companies. 'We prefer to work with managements to solve problems. We offered support against Sierra. But what they've done is to cave in to something very close to \"greenmail\". They've favoured one particular shareholder over another. So now it's no more Mr Hermes Nice Guy.' </p> <p>At first sight New Jersey-based Sierra, a relatively small arbitrage house, hardly seems to fit the shadow of Carl Icahn, the veteran stock market predator who claimed to have discovered 'greenmail' by accident in the 1980s. Buying a strategic stake and then persuading, cajoling or simply coercing companies to buy it back at a tidy profit was more lucrative than trying to take over the whole shooting match. </p> <p>Now 64, Icahn turned 'greenmail' into an art form: over 20 years, he has pocketed billions by turning the screw on some of the biggest corporations in the world. US Steel, Texaco, Trans World Airlines, Phillips Petroleum, tyremaker Goodrich-Uniroyal, RJR Nabisco and, most recently, General Motors. All hang on hooks in Icahn's trophy room. </p> <p>So lucrative the practice proved to be that all sorts of corporate wolves, including Goldsmith and Rupert Murdoch, took time off to make a killing through Wall Street raids. </p> <p>Sierra, certainly, is not in that league. For starters, it picks on investment trusts, quoted vehicles that buy shares in other stock market companies. Glamorous the sector is not. But it is a huge industry, worth \u00a355 billion, which is a key part of Britain's savings and investment scene. And like any other sector, it goes through periodic bouts of vicious blood-letting. </p> <p>More often than not, it is a touch of the Hannibal Lecters that stirs the sleepy industry from slumber. Ten years ago, the British Coal pension funds pounced in a \u00a31.1bn hostile bid for Globe Investment Trust and broke it up. Last year 3i, the giant of the industry, just failed to snap up rival Electra for \u00a31.25bn. What stirs the cannibal instinct is 'the discount'. All trust managers levy charges and, as a rule, most underper form the market. This manifests itself in the 'discount', the difference between the trust's market capitalisation and the value of the shares it owns. If the discount becomes too great, it pays to bid for a trust and, as British Coal did, sell the shares it owns. </p> <p>Over the past four years, Sierra, fronted by Alex Hanson, a 35-year-old arbitrageur, has made a tidy living for its rich US private investors by targeting floundering trusts in the UK. Its typical modus operandi is not to bid but threaten effectively to liquidate the trust, a vote of corporate hara-kiri. No wonder, then, that the cufflinks and braces brigade of fund-managers prefer to buy the likes of Sierra off when the comfortable job and Christmas bonus is on the line. </p> <p>Hanson stresses, of course, that Sierra's tactics have been vetted by some of the sharpest legal minds in the City. He spits blood at the connotations 'greenmail' conjures up (the practice is still legal in the US but, since a 1987 Act of Congress, the profits have been simply taxed away) and a letter from his City solicitors has already winged its way to Pitt-Watson. With justification, Hanson says it is up to trust boards to ensure they follow the rules. After all, what's at issue here is not the law but the sacred rule 9.16 of the UK stock exchange regulations, which says: 'A company having listed shares must ensure equality of treatment for all holders of such shares.' </p> <p>Hanson said: 'We have no control over these boards. We have been well-advised and there were leading brokers, like Cazenove, involved in all these transactions. The accusation of greenmail is totally misapplied in this case. They are making a huge thing out of it just to get more leverage over SIT. By cutting the discount, all shareholders benefit from our activity and none more so than Hermes.' </p> <p>Hermes first locked horns with Sierra in 1997, when the US arbitrageur took a tilt at Kleinwort's Overseas Invest ment Trust. Since then, Sierra has collected several scalps and in December mounted its biggest assault yet, threatening the liquidation of up to seven trusts, including SIT and the huge Foreign &amp; Colonial. To do so, Sierra ploughed \u00a3270 million into key stakes. Invariably, it was bought off, but in each case, except SIT, the trust made the same buy-back offer to all shareholders. In F&amp;C's case, Sierra declined the offer as not generous enough. </p> <p>Initially, SIT came out all guns blazing. But what has angered Hermes and other shareholders was SIT's volte- face on 11 January when it announced it had bought back the whole of Sierra's stake, nearly 8 million shares at 458p each - a generous 9.5 per cent discount to net asset value, against the prevailing 13 per cent in the market. However, SIT's subsequent offer to other investors, like Hermes, was limited to just 30 per cent of their shares. SIT's board, namely, only had authority to buy back 15 per cent of its stock in any one year and had used most of that already. 'I think the SIT board blew it. They should have given the other shareholders opportunity to sell,' Hanson told The Observer . </p> <p>The Scots, however, have so far refused to cede any ground to their disgruntled investors. 'There was quite a lot of uncertainty and we felt it was desirable to end that,' SIT managing director Ian McLeish said, justifying the Sierra about-turn. 'We have operated in accordance with the buy-back rules. We have 33,000 investors. It's just not possible to make a buy-back offer to all shareholders.' </p> <p>It is a hard-nosed stance Hermes intends to break by confronting SIT chairman Sir Angus Grossart at the trust's annual meeting this Friday in Edinburgh's Roxburghe Hotel in Charlotte Square, the heart of the Scottish financial establishment. Pitt-Watson will demand that SIT uses its new 15 per cent authority to launch a new buy-back - worth up to \u00a3150m - on the same terms given to Sierra. Otherwise, Hermes is prepared to recruit other City institutions and possibly remove SIT's board next year in a battle that would pitch London against Edinburgh. </p> <p>In the meantime, it has also asked the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, to investigate and plug any loopholes in stock exchange regulations. SIT denies any breach, but Hermes begs to differ. 'We think the rules have been broken. If they haven't, greenmail would be allowed and the FSA should tighten the rules,' Pitt-Watson said. 'The problem with greenmail is that if one person does it, everyone will. Greenmail benefits the aggressive, disruptive, des-tructive shareholders, not people like us who prefer to work alongside companies.' </p> <p><strong>Who's who in Charlotte Square</strong></p> <p> Edinburgh is Britain's second financial centre and its public school, royalist old guard is deeply suspicious - in equal measure - of new Labour politicians who brought devolution and the brash American money-men who have bought up the City of London. </p> <p>Edinburgh's fund managers - the 'Charlotte Square mafia' - invest \u00a3350 billion of pension and insurance funds, while in nearby St Andrews Square the banks and insurers, 'the Scotia Nostra', have been zealous in maintaining Scotland's distinct financial identity. </p> <p>In the middle, in Princes Street and George Street respectively, lie two bastions of the Scottish establishment network: the New Club, Edinburgh's leading 'gentleman's club', and Scottish Financial Enterprise, a private business club which promotes Edinburgh's money skills. </p> <p>With the arrival of self-made tycoons such as Stagecoach's Brian Souter, the sway of the old elite may be diminishing. But the blue-blooded establishment still wields considerable clout, and here are its current doyens: </p> <p>Sir Angus Grossart, 63, chairs Edinburgh merchant bank Noble Grossart and Scottish Investment Trust (SIT). Among 16 other board positions, he is vice-chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Edinburgh Fund Managers, a director of brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle and chair of the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail. He also belongs to the New Club and the Royal Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. </p> <p>Sir George Mathewson, 60, is deputy chairman and former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a director of SIT. He also chairs insurer Direct Line and in the Eighties was chief executive of the Scottish Development Agency. He, too, frequents the New Club. </p> <p>Viscount Younger of Leckie, 69, is the former Tory Minister of Defence and Scottish Secretary, George Younger. He now chairs the Royal Bank of Scotland and is on the board of two investment trusts in the Fleming and Murray stables. A member of the Caledonian Club, he is also a brigadier in the Royal Company of Archers and the Queen's Scottish 'bodyguard'. </p> <p>Sir John Shaw, 68, Governor of the Bank of Scotland, chair of Scottish Financial Enterprise and the Scottish American Investment Co, a director of five other trusts and numerous public and private bodies. Scotland's most prominent accountant, he is a member of both the New Club and Caledonian Club. </p> <p>Sir Charles Fraser, 72, is Scotland's most prominent corporate lawyer. A former vice-chair of United Biscuits, he has been on the board of umpteen Scottish firms and is still a director of insurer Scottish Widows and two investment trusts. He is, of course, a member of the New Club and plays golf at St Andrews.</p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,439362,00.html\">Hermes tackles Scottish elite</a></p>",

Over the past four years, Sierra, fronted by Alex Hanson, a 35-year-old arbitrageur, has made a tidy living for its rich US private investors by targeting floundering trusts in the UK. Its typical modus operandi is not to bid but threaten effectively to liquidate the trust, a vote of corporate hara-kiri. No wonder, then, that the cufflinks and braces brigade of fund-managers prefer to buy the likes of Sierra off when the comfortable job and Christmas bonus is on the line. Hanson stresses, of course, that Sierra's tactics have been vetted by some of the sharpest legal minds in the City. He spits blood at the connotations 'greenmail' conjures up (the practice is still legal in the US but, since a 1987 Act of Congress, the profits have been simply taxed away) and a letter from his City solicitors has already winged its way to Pitt-Watson. With justification, Hanson says it is up to trust boards to ensure they follow the rules. After all, what's at issue here is not the law but the sacred rule 9.16 of the UK stock exchange regulations, which says: 'A company having listed shares must ensure equality of treatment for all holders of such shares.' Hanson said: 'We have no control over these boards. We have been well-advised and there were leading brokers, like Cazenove, involved in all these transactions. The accusation of greenmail is totally misapplied in this case. They are making a huge thing out of it just to get more leverage over SIT. By cutting the discount, all shareholders benefit from our activity and none more so than Hermes.' Hermes first locked horns with Sierra in 1997, when the US arbitrageur took a tilt at Kleinwort's Overseas Invest ment Trust. Since then, Sierra has collected several scalps and in December mounted its biggest assault yet, threatening the liquidation of up to seven trusts, including SIT and the huge Foreign &amp; Colonial. To do so, Sierra ploughed \u00a3270 million into key stakes. Invariably, it was bought off, but in each case, except SIT, the trust made the same buy-back offer to all shareholders. In F&amp;C's case, Sierra declined the offer as not generous enough. Initially, SIT came out all guns blazing. But what has angered Hermes and other shareholders was SIT's volte- face on 11 January when it announced it had bought back the whole of Sierra's stake, nearly 8 million shares at 458p each - a generous 9.5 per cent discount to net asset value, against the prevailing 13 per cent in the market. However, SIT's subsequent offer to other investors, like Hermes, was limited to just 30 per cent of their shares. SIT's board, namely, only had authority to buy back 15 per cent of its stock in any one year and had used most of that already. 'I think the SIT board blew it. They should have given the other shareholders opportunity to sell,' Hanson told The Observer . The Scots, however, have so far refused to cede any ground to their disgruntled investors. 'There was quite a lot of uncertainty and we felt it was desirable to end that,' SIT managing director Ian McLeish said, justifying the Sierra about-turn. 'We have operated in accordance with the buy-back rules. We have 33,000 investors. It's just not possible to make a buy-back offer to all shareholders.' It is a hard-nosed stance Hermes intends to break by confronting SIT chairman Sir Angus Grossart at the trust's annual meeting this Friday in Edinburgh's Roxburghe Hotel in Charlotte Square, the heart of the Scottish financial establishment. Pitt-Watson will demand that SIT uses its new 15 per cent authority to launch a new buy-back - worth up to \u00a3150m - on the same terms given to Sierra. Otherwise, Hermes is prepared to recruit other City institutions and possibly remove SIT's board next year in a battle that would pitch London against Edinburgh. In the meantime, it has also asked the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, to investigate and plug any loopholes in stock exchange regulations. SIT denies any breach, but Hermes begs to differ. 'We think the rules have been broken. If they haven't, greenmail would be allowed and the FSA should tighten the rules,' Pitt-Watson said. 'The problem with greenmail is that if one person does it, everyone will. Greenmail benefits the aggressive, disruptive, des-tructive shareholders, not people like us who prefer to work alongside companies.' Who's who in Charlotte Square Edinburgh is Britain's second financial centre and its public school, royalist old guard is deeply suspicious - in equal measure - of new Labour politicians who brought devolution and the brash American money-men who have bought up the City of London. Edinburgh's fund managers - the 'Charlotte Square mafia' - invest \u00a3350 billion of pension and insurance funds, while in nearby St Andrews Square the banks and insurers, 'the Scotia Nostra', have been zealous in maintaining Scotland's distinct financial identity. In the middle, in Princes Street and George Street respectively, lie two bastions of the Scottish establishment network: the New Club, Edinburgh's leading 'gentleman's club', and Scottish Financial Enterprise, a private business club which promotes Edinburgh's money skills. With the arrival of self-made tycoons such as Stagecoach's Brian Souter, the sway of the old elite may be diminishing. But the blue-blooded establishment still wields considerable clout, and here are its current doyens: Sir Angus Grossart, 63, chairs Edinburgh merchant bank Noble Grossart and Scottish Investment Trust (SIT). Among 16 other board positions, he is vice-chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Edinburgh Fund Managers, a director of brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle and chair of the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail. He also belongs to the New Club and the Royal Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. Sir George Mathewson, 60, is deputy chairman and former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a director of SIT. He also chairs insurer Direct Line and in the Eighties was chief executive of the Scottish Development Agency. He, too, frequents the New Club. Viscount Younger of Leckie, 69, is the former Tory Minister of Defence and Scottish Secretary, George Younger. He now chairs the Royal Bank of Scotland and is on the board of two investment trusts in the Fleming and Murray stables. A member of the Caledonian Club, he is also a brigadier in the Royal Company of Archers and the Queen's Scottish 'bodyguard'. Sir John Shaw, 68, Governor of the Bank of Scotland, chair of Scottish Financial Enterprise and the Scottish American Investment Co, a director of five other trusts and numerous public and private bodies. Scotland's most prominent accountant, he is a member of both the New Club and Caledonian Club. Sir Charles Fraser, 72, is Scotland's most prominent corporate lawyer. A former vice-chair of United Biscuits, he has been on the board of umpteen Scottish firms and is still a director of insurer Scottish Widows and two investment trusts. He is, of course, a member of the New Club and plays golf at St Andrews. Hermes tackles Scottish elite",

Coe's philosophy was to strip himself down by single-mindedly and obsessively focusing on the goal ahead. 'You present yourself at the starting line in the best physical and mental condition,' he explained to bemused Tory MPs. He was Britain's greatest-ever middle distance runner Britain - a double 1500 metre Olympic gold medallist in Moscow in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.

Publicly his role is straightforward he organises things - planes, schedules, speaking engagements - and even acts as a kind of unofficial bodyguard. But privately his role remains a mystery even to many members of the Shadow Cabinet. Coe is undoubtedly Hague's closest confidant - the two men speak several times a day - but the content of their conversations remains veiled. It is a pragmatic relationship, not an ideological one.

      "body": "<p>The production of Britain's most talked about film - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - is in jeopardy this weekend due to a legal confusion surrounding its young star, Daniel Radcliffe.</p> <p>The career of the 11-year-old, who plays Potter, is in danger of being cut short due to regulations which govern the amount of time children are allowed to work. The bureaucratic obstacle would mark a dismal end to a magical story for Daniel, who was picked from thousands for the starring role of the young wizard.</p> <p>Principal photography on the \u00a3110 million film of J. K. Rowling's first bestseller was due to finish next month, but bad weather has delayed location filming around Britain and the film's director, Christopher Columbus, desperately needs more time. The Observer can reveal that he does not have it.</p> <p>On Friday the staff of the legal department of a London council confirmed that the vast Hollywood machine will have to grind to a halt because Daniel has been licensed to play the role only until the end of March. As a schoolboy, permission for him to take up professional film work had to be legally granted last year by his local education authority, in this case Hammersmith and Fulham.

      "bodyText": "The production of Britain's most talked about film - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - is in jeopardy this weekend due to a legal confusion surrounding its young star, Daniel Radcliffe. The career of the 11-year-old, who plays Potter, is in danger of being cut short due to regulations which govern the amount of time children are allowed to work. The bureaucratic obstacle would mark a dismal end to a magical story for Daniel, who was picked from thousands for the starring role of the young wizard. Principal photography on the \u00a3110 million film of J. K. Rowling's first bestseller was due to finish next month, but bad weather has delayed location filming around Britain and the film's director, Christopher Columbus, desperately needs more time. The Observer can reveal that he does not have it. On Friday the staff of the legal department of a London council confirmed that the vast Hollywood machine will have to grind to a halt because Daniel has been licensed to play the role only until the end of March. As a schoolboy, permission for him to take up professional film work had to be legally granted last year by his local education authority, in this case Hammersmith and Fulham. The authority has confirmed that it has not licensed an extension for Daniel beyond the 140-day permission he was granted from 15 September last year. 'At the moment Daniel is licensed to work until the end of March. We have categorically not agreed on an extension for the extra days yet, and in fact we have not seen an application for an extension,' said a spokesman for Hammersmith and Fulham. 'Although Daniel attends a private school, his application for permission to work must come to us and we must be satisfied that his education is being organised properly. It is our statutory duty to consider this and to worry about exploitation.' Actors Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Rik Mayall, Richard Harris, Zoe Wanamaker, John Hurt and John Cleese have all joined Daniel on the set at Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire and on location King's Cross Station in London was used to film Potter's train journey to Hogwarts School, which famously leaves from Platform 9 3/4 . The production team on the film say they have been careful to look after all their child stars, who include Emma Watson, who plays Hermione, and Rupert Grint, who plays Ron. Private tuition has been organised for all three on the set and they are not allowed to work more than five days in seven. But Warner Brothers has not been able to control the English weather, and without speedy work from the studio's legal department this will be the film's undoing. All three young stars will also need separate permissions to start any work on the second film in the series - planned to begin filming later this year, before the release of the first film in November. 'It is a very complicated issue,' a spokeswoman for the film told The Observer on Friday as the production team finished a day's filming in Gloucestershire. 'It is hugely logistically difficult to look after all these children, and our arrangements for Daniel are absolutely confidential. We have a legal team working on the film and he is our star. If the right letter has not been sent out yet, I am sure the right questions will be asked and the law will be adhered to.'

To finish the first film, Warner Brothers needs to use Daniel for an additional 20 days and they want to extend his permission to work into July. The question of permission for the second film has not yet been broached. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which deals with working practices for children, confirmed that, however good working conditions are on location, filming would have to stop if the permissions are not granted. 'The terms of the licence mean what they say in these cases, no matter how much money is involved,' she said.",

Directed by Phillip Noyce, whose credits include Patriot Games and The Saint, the film is set in early 1950s Vietnam, a country wracked by war as the curtain comes down on French colonial rule. It tells the story of a doomed love triangle involving a jaded British war correspondent, Fowler, played by Sir Michael Caine, an idealistic American agent, Pyle, played by Brendan Fraser, and a young Vietnamese girl, Phuong, played by local newcomer Hai Yen. Fraser's character, Alden Pyle, is The Quiet American of the title, a man in the words of Greene's 1955 novel 'determined... to do good, not to any individual person but to a country, a continent, a world' - with disastrous results. The makers say they are aiming for a far more faithful adaptation of Greene's work than a 1950s Hollywood version, which turned the plot on its head to make Pyle an anti-communist hero. Scriptwriter Christopher Hampton, an Academy Award winner with Dangerous Liaisons, said he hoped Greene, with whom he worked on an adaptation of his later novel The Honorary Consul - which also starred Caine - would have been somewhat happier with this version of The Quiet American . But he said the author, who died in 1991, was a notoriously difficult man to please. 'I think he would be slightly happier,' Hampton said. 'But he was not disposed to be terribly happy with any of the adaptations of his books. When I did The Honorary Consul while he was still alive, I tried to be very faithful with that as well, but he wasn't too happy with it.' He said Greene had been 'outraged' by the original version of The Quiet American by Joseph L Mankiewicz, seeing it as a complete betrayal of the book's message. 'It was turned from an accurate representation of the historical circumstances of the time into an anti-communist tract, brought about, I suppose, by the climate of the time in America, where you couldn't take an objective view,' Hampton said. 'In fact, that's what the novel's all about - the incapability of people to take an objective view.' Hampton said he believed Greene's work still carried an important message today.'It's always timely to say \"Don't interfere in the affairs of other countries\".' The script has clearly struck the right note with the communist authorities in Vietnam, who gave approval on the grounds that 'it condemns the manoeuvres of hostile forces and foreign aggressors against the Vietnamese people'. They have allowed the film-makers to shut off a key section of a city centre thoroughfare renamed Dong Khoi - or 'Uprising' Street - after Saigon itself became Ho Chi Minh City with the Communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975, to recreate the colonial-era rue Catinat. The production team say they have also secured permission to recreate a 1952 bomb attack Greene was to blame on a 'Third Force' - neither colonialist nor communist - that Pyle championed. The film-makers have succeeded in creating an authentically period feel on the set, with the ubiquitous Japanese motorcycles and cars of today giving way to vintage Peugeots, Citr\u00f6ens, bicycles and three-wheeled 'cyclo' pedal taxis of the colonial era. And more than 45 years after France's ignominious exit from Indochina, the kepis and khaki of its colonial police force and military again graced the streets of a city once dubbed 'Paris of the East'. The crew is scheduled to film for five weeks in Vietnam, with shooting also scheduled in Hanoi, the national capital, as well as the towns of Hoi An and Danang.",

      "body": "<p>I've never agreed with TS Eliot about April. Anyone who's lived through the last six weeks in Britain will know that January and February are far crueller months, especially if you to have to travel by tube. Endless gloomy days of endless gloomy drizzle make me long for the southern hemisphere. I'm not alone in this. Half the British wine-writing fraternity seemed to have made the journey to New Zealand this month. Frankly, it would have been churlish not to join them. </p> <p>There aren't many bright moments on the tasting calendar at this time of year. The Australia Day tasting, when a swarm of winemakers breezes in from Down Under buzzing with news of shark attacks and beach barbies, is one. But the most enjoyable of all is the annual tasting held by The Bunch.</p> <p>If you buy most of your wine from supermarkets or high street chains, you probably won't be aware of The Bunch's existence. This like-minded group of independent wine merchants sounds like something directed by Sam Peckinpah, but its aims are a good deal more sociable. Their purpose, this and every other year, is to present what one of their number calls 'wines which express the individual character of their markers as well as a vivid sense of place'.</p> <p>It has to be said that they don't always succeed. Some of the wines they show are overpriced - any takers for 1997 Chteau Le Tertre Roteboeuf, St Emilion at \u00a361 a bottle? - but most are interesting and many delicious. At a time when wine styles are moving towards over-processed homogeneity, it's good to taste wines that provoke debate.</p> <p>The Bunch doesn't include all of my favourite independent merchants, but it's still a pretty good line up. Tanners, Yapp Brothers, Lay &amp; Wheeler, John Armit, Corney &amp; Barrow and Adnams are some of finest operations in the land. I'd like to see a larger group including the likes of Morris &amp; Verdin, Berry Brothers, Justerini &amp; Brooks, Vin du Van, Lea &amp; Sandeman, Raeburn Fine Wines and The Vine Trail, but The Bunch's aim is to stay small enough to sit around a table for lunch.</p> <p>Members of The Bunch are bound by a code of practice covering stock records of wines held on customers' behalf, mail order and, best of all, the promise that 'If you don't like any wine you buy from us, for whatever reason, return it within a month and we shall refund your money.' Against the odds, the independent sector has survived the rise of the supermarkets and the depredations of cross-Channel trade. It's all part of the shift towards 'authenticity'. Just as my spirits perk up every time I see a new farmers' market, so I smile at the sight of a flourishing local wine merchant. Not before time, there are signs we are learning to value expertise and quality. He might be wrong about April, but I have a feeling TS Eliot would approve.</p> <p><strong>Best cellars</strong></p> <p>Five great wines from the five members of The Bunch.</p> <p><strong> Mariscal Manzanilla, Tanners</strong> (\u00a36.85, Tanners, 01743 234 500). A Tanners exclusive, sourced from Dolores Bustillo Delgado in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, this is a brilliant example of Sherry's most delicate style. It's fresh and yeasty with a salty, seafaring tang. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Les Terrasses, Alavaro Palacios, Priorato</strong> (\u00a312.03, Corney &amp; Barrow, 020 7539 3200). A blend of old vine Cari\u00f1ena, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon. Dense and darkly coloured with subtle oak, sweet tannins and notes of plum and cassis. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Cullen Sauvignon/Semillon, Margaret River</strong> (\u00a311.95, Adnams, 01502 727 220). Vanya Cullen is one of Australia's finest winemakers, as demonstrated by this take on a classic Bordeaux blend. A citrus-tinged white with remarkable harmony and length. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Seresin Pinot Noir, Marlborough</strong> (\u00a315.83, John Armit, 020 7908 0600). New Zealand's Pinot Noirs are as good as anyone's outside Burgundy.

      "bodyText": "I've never agreed with TS Eliot about April. Anyone who's lived through the last six weeks in Britain will know that January and February are far crueller months, especially if you to have to travel by tube. Endless gloomy days of endless gloomy drizzle make me long for the southern hemisphere. I'm not alone in this. Half the British wine-writing fraternity seemed to have made the journey to New Zealand this month. Frankly, it would have been churlish not to join them. There aren't many bright moments on the tasting calendar at this time of year. The Australia Day tasting, when a swarm of winemakers breezes in from Down Under buzzing with news of shark attacks and beach barbies, is one. But the most enjoyable of all is the annual tasting held by The Bunch. If you buy most of your wine from supermarkets or high street chains, you probably won't be aware of The Bunch's existence. This like-minded group of independent wine merchants sounds like something directed by Sam Peckinpah, but its aims are a good deal more sociable. Their purpose, this and every other year, is to present what one of their number calls 'wines which express the individual character of their markers as well as a vivid sense of place'. It has to be said that they don't always succeed. Some of the wines they show are overpriced - any takers for 1997 Chteau Le Tertre Roteboeuf, St Emilion at \u00a361 a bottle? - but most are interesting and many delicious. At a time when wine styles are moving towards over-processed homogeneity, it's good to taste wines that provoke debate. The Bunch doesn't include all of my favourite independent merchants, but it's still a pretty good line up. Tanners, Yapp Brothers, Lay &amp; Wheeler, John Armit, Corney &amp; Barrow and Adnams are some of finest operations in the land. I'd like to see a larger group including the likes of Morris &amp; Verdin, Berry Brothers, Justerini &amp; Brooks, Vin du Van, Lea &amp; Sandeman, Raeburn Fine Wines and The Vine Trail, but The Bunch's aim is to stay small enough to sit around a table for lunch. Members of The Bunch are bound by a code of practice covering stock records of wines held on customers' behalf, mail order and, best of all, the promise that 'If you don't like any wine you buy from us, for whatever reason, return it within a month and we shall refund your money.' Against the odds, the independent sector has survived the rise of the supermarkets and the depredations of cross-Channel trade. It's all part of the shift towards 'authenticity'. Just as my spirits perk up every time I see a new farmers' market, so I smile at the sight of a flourishing local wine merchant. Not before time, there are signs we are learning to value expertise and quality. He might be wrong about April, but I have a feeling TS Eliot would approve. Best cellars Five great wines from the five members of The Bunch. Mariscal Manzanilla, Tanners (\u00a36.85, Tanners, 01743 234 500). A Tanners exclusive, sourced from Dolores Bustillo Delgado in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, this is a brilliant example of Sherry's most delicate style. It's fresh and yeasty with a salty, seafaring tang. 1998 Les Terrasses, Alavaro Palacios, Priorato (\u00a312.03, Corney &amp; Barrow, 020 7539 3200). A blend of old vine Cari\u00f1ena, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon. Dense and darkly coloured with subtle oak, sweet tannins and notes of plum and cassis. 1999 Cullen Sauvignon/Semillon, Margaret River (\u00a311.95, Adnams, 01502 727 220). Vanya Cullen is one of Australia's finest winemakers, as demonstrated by this take on a classic Bordeaux blend. A citrus-tinged white with remarkable harmony and length. 1999 Seresin Pinot Noir, Marlborough (\u00a315.83, John Armit, 020 7908 0600). New Zealand's Pinot Noirs are as good as anyone's outside Burgundy. From filmmaker Michael Seresin's showpiece estate, this Pinot has the balance to age for five years. 1997 Barbera d'Alba, Vigna Martina, Elio Grasso (\u00a319.40, Lay &amp; Wheeler, 01206 764 446). An early contender for my wine of the year, Elio Grasso's latest release takes Barbera to new levels. A swirling, passionate masterpiece of a red. A stunner.",

      "body": "<p>The contemporary diet is one of extremes. Vietnamese hot-and-sour vegetable soup one day, cauliflower cheese the next; today nigiri sushi with pickled ginger, tomorrow rice pudding with a blob of plum jam. And yesterday afternoon's cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey tea will be all the sweeter for being followed by a supper of chicken vindaloo and its ensuing ring of fire. Pushing our tastebuds to the limit is what makes our eating - and cooking - interesting. </p> <p>There cannot be much wrong with a diet that can run the gamut from custard tart to kick-ass chilli sauce. In fact, I see everything right with the ability to savour extremes. The only diet that does not appeal is the humdrum, the ordinary, meat-and-two-veg cooking that is the equivalent of dressing permanently in beige. Food that goes without remark. Cooking for those who couldn't care less what they eat, just so long as it is hot and on time. To eat well, we need to be open-minded as well as open-mouthed. </p> <p>Quack diets for the rich and famous aside, most of us like to take in our daily dose of carbohydrate. No food group is quite so receptive to the extremes of seasoning as the pasta, noodles, rice and beans that our eclectic diet now includes. Pasta is just as welcome as part of a gently flavoured lasagne as it is slathered in a fierce arrabbiata sauce. Rice may come as a soporific risotto or as a bolster for a mouth-popping prawn curry, and beans seem just as suited to the sweet tomato sauce of commerce as to be hidden in an explosively hot Deep Southern spicy bean bake. Yet none of them is quite so amenable as our beloved potato. </p> <p>A love for the spud is something ingrained in our collective culinary psyche, an essential part of our national dish, our favourite street food, our Christmas feast. No national celebration is complete without the tattie, be it baked in embers of the Guy Fawkes pyre or scrubbed and delicately buttered to toast the first of the wild salmon. It is the first food we turn to for warmth and comfort, the food we find most difficult to spurn on a weight-loss diet. I suppose it must say something for the spud that when I excitedly, briefly, met my idol Marianne Faithfull at a party, we spent the whole time discussing the Irish potato famine. This guy sure knows how to party. </p> <p>Whether it is steamed over Evian water or interred under a bubbling blanket of tear-jerking chilli sauce, the potato never fails to satisfy. Whether we are in the mood for chips and beer or toying with the light-as-air balloons known as pommes souffl\u00e9, we will probably be just as happy. The potato is the ultimate good-time food, good naturedly taking any mood we care to throw at it. </p> <p>Feel the need for a sinus-clearing curry? Dying for a spoonful of sleepy, buttery mash? Then look no further than Solanum tuberosum . You can take this vegetable in whatever direction you desire. This week, with the cold winter rain still pattering on the kitchen skylights, I set my compass for comfort cooking. There are times, like now, when it is cold enough to wear a fleece indoors as well as out, when bland is a good thing. By bland I mean creamy and starchy and as unchallenging as a Mills &amp; Boon novel. </p> <p>The floury winter potatoes - Maris Piper, King Edward, Golden Wonder and their ilk - are all better at soaking up copious quantities of cream or stock than the waxy summer varieties. There is a god. There is also something about a starchy root sodden with salty stock or garlic-enriched double cream that is as comforting as a cashmere hot-water bottle cover. The gambit here is to lightly boil the potatoes first. They seem more inclined to sponge up the liquid that way. You know how roast potatoes are always more moist in the middle if you boil them before you add them to the fat round the roast - well, likewise any potato that is to be baked with chicken stock or cream. Try it. Whether or not it works for you, it is certain to cut down the baking time - important to anyone who has ever waited in vain for their pommes Dauphinoise to tenderise. </p> <p>If a balmy dish of tubers is not what you had in mind, then take the other extreme. Take your daily dose of carbs salt-crusted with ginger, chilli and mustard seed then add stark contrast with a slick of sharp, natural yogurt. Bland or mind-blowing, hot enough to make your eyes water and your tongue swell or as smooth as a dish of whipped cream, the potato is up for anything. Just what we need for these extreme times.</p> <p><strong> Potato and celeriac tart</strong><br> </p> <p>If there is one thing better than slices of potato cooked slowly with garlic and cream, it is when they also come wrapped in a pastry crust. Extreme comfort cooking, this. I put it on the table with a bowl of salad - oak-leaf lettuce, trendy red trevisse and hot watercress tossed in a mustard dressing. A lively salad with which everyone mopped up the garlicky cream left on their plates. </p> <p><strong>5 medium to large potatoes</strong><br> <strong>1 large head of celeriac </strong><br> <strong>425g puff pastry </strong><br> <strong>2 large cloves of garlic </strong><br> <strong>2 or 3 bay leaves </strong><br> <strong>2 eggs </strong><br> <strong>400ml double cream </strong><br> <strong>100ml full cream milk</strong><br> <strong>nutmeg </strong></p> <p>You will also need a large, heavy frying pan or a baking tin - about 30cm in diameter. </p> <p>Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil. Peel the potatoes and the celeriac and slice no thicker than a pound coin, add them to the boiling water, then salt and turn down to a simmer. After 5 minutes or so, they will be tender but far from falling apart. Drain them carefully and set aside. </p> <p>Roll half of the pastry to fit your baking tin or frying pan. It needs to come all the way up the sides. Lightly oil or butter the pan, then place the pastry in the bottom and push it gently up the sides. It is important that there are no holes in the pastry, otherwise the cream will leak. </p> <p>Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6. Peel and slice the garlic. Layer the potatoes and celeriac on top of the pastry, tucking in the slices of garlic and the bay leaves as you go. Beat the eggs with a fork, then stir in the cream and milk and season with salt, black pepper and a grating of nutmeg, then pour it over the potatoes. </p> <p>Cut the second piece of pastry to fit the top of the pie, wet the edges with beaten egg, milk or water, then lay the pastry on top of the potatoes and squeeze the edges firmly together. </p> <p>Cut two small holes in the top to let out the steam, brush the top with a little beaten egg or milk, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the top is golden brown. </p> <p><strong> Spiced roast potatoes</strong><br> </p> <p>I usually make these little cubes of spiced, crisp potatoes to go with cold roast meat for a Monday supper. I make a cooling spinach salad to go with it, too. Serves 4 as a side dish. </p> <p><strong>2 large potatoes (about 600g) </strong><br> <strong>2 tbsp groundnut or vegetable oil </strong><br> <strong>1 onion </strong><br> <strong>2 fat cloves of garlic </strong><br> <strong>1 or 2 small, hot red chillis, depending on your heat threshold </strong><br> <strong>a 3cm-long knob of ginger </strong><br> <strong>1 tsp black mustard seeds </strong><br> <strong>scant tsp ground turmeric </strong><br> <strong>the juice of half a small lemon </strong><br> <strong>natural yogurt to serve </strong></p> <p>Put a medium-sized pan of water on to boil. This is a rustic recipe and there is no need to peel the potatoes, but you can if you wish. Cut them into thick slices then into large dice - about 1cm - then boil them for 7 or 8 minutes in the boiling water. When they are almost tender, drain them. </p> <p>While the potatoes are boiling, peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, deseed and chop the chilli, and skin and finely shred the ginger. </p> <p>Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6. Warm the oil in a baking dish or shallow enamelled casserole over a moderate heat. Add the onion, garlic, ginger and chopped chilli and leave to cook, gently, so that the onion softens but does not brown. Add the mustard seed and the turmeric, then the drained potatoes. Toss gently (with a wooden spoon, so as not to mash the potatoes), then squeeze over the lemon juice and add a grinding of freshly ground pepper and a generous seasoning of salt. Bake for about 35 minutes until they are golden brown and crisp around the edges. </p> <p>When they come from the oven, spoon over a little yogurt - 3 or 4 tbsp should be enough - and serve.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Telephone: </strong>020 7700 7161<br><strong>Address: </strong>16-18 Highbury Corner, London N5 <br>Lunch for two, including service, \u00a318. </p> <p>Dorothy Parker had the round table at the Algonquin in New York. Jean-Paul Sartre had his berth at Les Deux Magots in Paris. And Tony Parsons, our own wit and philosopher of the male ego? Tony has a booth at an Italian caff called the Trevi, hard by Highbury Corner in north London, the better to fuel up for his kung-fu lessons after a hard day's graft at the literary coalface. From the outside, the Trevi looks like - as Churchill almost said of Atlee - a modest place with much to be modest about. Likewise, its location is hardly something to arouse the ardour of estate agents, sitting, as it does, on one of the least-lovely stretches of the Holloway Road (though, granted, identifying such a thing is a little like trying to identify the least-lovely stretch of the late Arthur Mullard; one is hideously spoilt for choice). </p> <p>But then flimsy attributes such as prettiness and aspect are for those soft tossers who tiptoe past the boutiques and bistros of Islington's Upper Street, just a stone's throw away across Highbury Corner. No, up here they are made of much sterner stuff. They look for authenticity and value, for credibility and consistency, and on all these counts the Trevi scores highly. It is a Highbury Corner landmark with a herd of regulars who will happily queue out the door for the chance to down substantial platefuls of the Trevi's food, which could best be described as Italian trattoria meets (high-class) school dinners. </p> <p>'Come 1.30pm, you've got less chance of getting a table here than you have at the Ivy,' Tony says as we slip into a booth in the simple dining room that leads off the sandwich bar area. The walls are sunflower yellow and delicately half-timbered, the floors tiled in that utilitarian way of sports changing rooms. It is a room in which to eat. Happily it is midday and, though it is already three-quarters full, there is space. Later, it will fill up with solicitors from the inner-city law firm up the road. The guy from the gay opticians across the road is usually here most lunchtimes, too. </p> <p>And there's Tony, of course. 'I probably come here three, four times a week,' he says. 'Sometimes for breakfast, sometimes for tea. I come in for lunch at least once a week - particularly if I have some hard work to do.' Like those kung-fu lessons on a Thursday evening. He started coming 15 years ago when he used to drive over from Stoke Newington. Now he lives just round the corner and he's become almost part of the furniture. Up on a shelf behind the sandwich bar they have two copies of Tony's bestselling novel Man and Boy , one in Italian and one in English. It represents the neat dichotomy of the place. 'Up front all the talk is of West Ham and Arsenal,' Tony says. 'In the kitchens everybody speaks Italian and it's Juventus and Inter Milan.' </p> <p>Likewise with the food. Regulars don't bother looking at the menu, preferring instead to pick lunch off the changing list of daily specials on the blackboard. But I am not a regular, so I'll look at the menu, if only for its refreshing simplicity. In a restaurant world obsessed with the listing of every ingredient, there is something almost indecently refreshing about a list that says: prawn cocktail, minestrone, spaghetti bolognese, lasagne. I tried the latter on my previous visit here and a grand meaty dishful it was: crispy and chewy on top, lush and sticky beneath. A lasagne from the olden days - and all for \u00a34.50. </p> <p>In the end, we choose off the blackboard. Tony has the gnocchi pomodoro, a rustling plateful of plump dumplings in a rich tomato sauce at \u00a34.40. I go for the risotto alla marinara at \u00a34.50. It, too, is a grand serving, the soft rice thick with mussels, prawns and extraordinarily tender rings of calamari. It's the kind of straight-up, robust Italian food we would eulogise for its peasant earthiness if eaten at a roadside inn amid the olive groves of Tuscany. The fact that the view is less olive groves than the splutter and grunt of number 19 buses should not make the food any less admirable. </p> <p>Each day there is always what Tony refers to as the school-dinner option. Today, the main course is steak pie and veg which, he says, they do very well. Down the bottom right-hand corner of the blackboard is the matching pudding. Today, it's apple crumble with custard at \u00a31.80 a shot, which we just had to have: the crumble was crisp and sugary, the fruit soft, the custard just as smooth and sweet as you remember it. You can get wine by the glass, though some people bring in their own bottles.

      "bodyText": "Telephone: 020 7700 7161 Address: 16-18 Highbury Corner, London N5 Lunch for two, including service, \u00a318. Dorothy Parker had the round table at the Algonquin in New York. Jean-Paul Sartre had his berth at Les Deux Magots in Paris. And Tony Parsons, our own wit and philosopher of the male ego? Tony has a booth at an Italian caff called the Trevi, hard by Highbury Corner in north London, the better to fuel up for his kung-fu lessons after a hard day's graft at the literary coalface. From the outside, the Trevi looks like - as Churchill almost said of Atlee - a modest place with much to be modest about. Likewise, its location is hardly something to arouse the ardour of estate agents, sitting, as it does, on one of the least-lovely stretches of the Holloway Road (though, granted, identifying such a thing is a little like trying to identify the least-lovely stretch of the late Arthur Mullard; one is hideously spoilt for choice). But then flimsy attributes such as prettiness and aspect are for those soft tossers who tiptoe past the boutiques and bistros of Islington's Upper Street, just a stone's throw away across Highbury Corner. No, up here they are made of much sterner stuff. They look for authenticity and value, for credibility and consistency, and on all these counts the Trevi scores highly. It is a Highbury Corner landmark with a herd of regulars who will happily queue out the door for the chance to down substantial platefuls of the Trevi's food, which could best be described as Italian trattoria meets (high-class) school dinners. 'Come 1.30pm, you've got less chance of getting a table here than you have at the Ivy,' Tony says as we slip into a booth in the simple dining room that leads off the sandwich bar area. The walls are sunflower yellow and delicately half-timbered, the floors tiled in that utilitarian way of sports changing rooms. It is a room in which to eat. Happily it is midday and, though it is already three-quarters full, there is space. Later, it will fill up with solicitors from the inner-city law firm up the road. The guy from the gay opticians across the road is usually here most lunchtimes, too. And there's Tony, of course. 'I probably come here three, four times a week,' he says. 'Sometimes for breakfast, sometimes for tea. I come in for lunch at least once a week - particularly if I have some hard work to do.' Like those kung-fu lessons on a Thursday evening. He started coming 15 years ago when he used to drive over from Stoke Newington. Now he lives just round the corner and he's become almost part of the furniture. Up on a shelf behind the sandwich bar they have two copies of Tony's bestselling novel Man and Boy , one in Italian and one in English. It represents the neat dichotomy of the place. 'Up front all the talk is of West Ham and Arsenal,' Tony says. 'In the kitchens everybody speaks Italian and it's Juventus and Inter Milan.' Likewise with the food. Regulars don't bother looking at the menu, preferring instead to pick lunch off the changing list of daily specials on the blackboard. But I am not a regular, so I'll look at the menu, if only for its refreshing simplicity. In a restaurant world obsessed with the listing of every ingredient, there is something almost indecently refreshing about a list that says: prawn cocktail, minestrone, spaghetti bolognese, lasagne. I tried the latter on my previous visit here and a grand meaty dishful it was: crispy and chewy on top, lush and sticky beneath. A lasagne from the olden days - and all for \u00a34.50. In the end, we choose off the blackboard. Tony has the gnocchi pomodoro, a rustling plateful of plump dumplings in a rich tomato sauce at \u00a34.40. I go for the risotto alla marinara at \u00a34.50. It, too, is a grand serving, the soft rice thick with mussels, prawns and extraordinarily tender rings of calamari. It's the kind of straight-up, robust Italian food we would eulogise for its peasant earthiness if eaten at a roadside inn amid the olive groves of Tuscany. The fact that the view is less olive groves than the splutter and grunt of number 19 buses should not make the food any less admirable. Each day there is always what Tony refers to as the school-dinner option. Today, the main course is steak pie and veg which, he says, they do very well. Down the bottom right-hand corner of the blackboard is the matching pudding. Today, it's apple crumble with custard at \u00a31.80 a shot, which we just had to have: the crumble was crisp and sugary, the fruit soft, the custard just as smooth and sweet as you remember it. You can get wine by the glass, though some people bring in their own bottles. Robert Biagioni, current owner and son of the man who first started here 40 years ago, says he doesn't really mind, though he'd prefer it if people drank his wine. The total bill, including a couple of fine cappuccinos, a Coke and a mineral water comes to \u00a316.70, which Tony insists on paying. 'It's the Trevi,' he says. 'I'll do it.' We're on his patch today, so it's his shout. Fair enough: both I, and The Observer 's accounts department, salute him. At the Trevi, there's really not much point arguing over the bill.

      "body": "<p>Jan Marthin Pasalbessy only wanted his daughter to be safe. Christina, 14, was the victim of a racist attack last June near where she lived with her widower father in Newport, Gwent. Mr Pasalbessy, a 48-year-old former merchant seaman from Indonesia, took her to the Royal Gwent Hospital for head X-rays. There, by chance, he ran into members of the group who had attacked his daughter. This time it was the father who got the racist abuse; the gang, some just teenagers, laid in to him, kicking and punching him to the ground, while Christina looked on, terrified.</p> <p>'As the 16-year-old attacked her dad she remembers him saying, \"Come on you black bastard\",' the prosecution told a court in Newport at the trial of the assailants. 'The attack was unprovoked, gratuitous violence.'</p> <p>Mr Pasalbessy died the next day from head injuries, leaving his daughter an orphan. Last week at Newport Crown Court the gang of four were all convicted of murder.</p> <p>The murder of Christina's father was one of at least eight killings in Britain with a racist element since the publication two years ago of Sir William Macpherson's ground-breaking report into the botched Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry. It is proof that while the report marked a watershed in our understanding of racism in Britain, and sounded a warning to all the agencies and institutions charged with fighting it, racism itself has not gone away.</p> <p>Curiously, the judge at the trial of Pasalbessy's killers ruled that, despite use of racist language, the murder was not racially motivated. Though it has no statutory force, Macpherson defines a racist incident as one 'perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person'. As Mr Pasalbessy's stepson Paul Heard said after the trial: 'If Jan had been a white person he would be here today.'</p> <p>The same doubtless applies to the other cases we highlight today: Zahid Mubarek, 19, murdered by his cellmate, a known racist, at Feltham Young Offenders Institution; Kombra Divakaren, beaten to death by a gang outside his shop in west London; Ben Kamanalagi, beaten to death with baseball bats in Salford. They, and all the other victims pictured here, show where hatred based on the colour of another's skin can lead.</p> <p>But they do not give us the true picture of racism in Britain. For most members of ethnic minority groups racism is about verbal harassment and intimidation, petty attacks that build up over time, an air of menace that kills the spirit while leaving the body intact. The problem is that, for years, it has been impossible to get a true picture of that kind of racist crime. Victims, convinced the authorities didn't give a damn, would fail to report what had happened to them. Macpherson drew a line in the sand: the police and other agencies had to record racist incidents. Only when we know what's going on, he said, can we begin to do something about it.</p> <p>And here there have been results. Each year the Home Office publishes statistics on race and the criminal justice system. Last month the figures covering April 1999 to April 2000 - the first full year since the Lawrence Report was published - were made available. The results were staggering: a 107 per cent increase in England and Wales in reported racist incidents, leaping from 23,049 to 47,814.</p> <p>In some constabularies, like Kent and Gloucestershire, the leap was over 200 per cent. In Devon and Cornwall it was 364 per cent. In West Mercia - which covers Shropshire - it was 459 per cent.</p> <p>These are not necessarily hard, violent crimes. It might be verbal abuse, graffiti or anything that comes with the dirty stain of racism. These figures begin to give a real picture of what daily life is like for Britain's ethnic minorities.</p> <p>But these statistics are not enough. There were over 23,000 racist incidents in the London area in the year covered. On paper that would seem to make the capital a dangerous place for people from ethnic minority groups. But then London has the highest ethnic minority population in the country at nearly 1.2 million. Clearly, to get a real picture of what is going on, more analysis is needed.</p> <p>And so, for the first time ever, The Observer has created a map of racism in England and Wales by comparing the number of incidents recorded to the size of the local ethnic minority population, the only true measure. Swiftly a pattern emerges: the worst areas are not places like London or Manchester or the West Midlands with high numbers of visible ethnic minorities, but the more rural parts of Britain, where fewer members of the Asian and Afro-Caribbean community choose to live.</p> <p>It's places like Northumbria, where one in 12 of the ethnic minority community is likely, on average, to have experienced a racist incident. It's South Wales, near where Jan Pasalbessy was killed (one in 15). Or Devon and Cornwall (one in 16). These are the hotspots. London, where racist incidents will have affected less than one in 50 of the population, is relatively safe. Likewise in the West Midlands, the figure is almost one in 200.</p> <p>A similar exercise for Scotland would have been useful, but the wheels move disgracefully slowly there. Ten days ago the Scottish Executive Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Steering Group, set up to tackle problems of racism in Scottish society, issued its second report. It announced that police in Scotland still need to develop 'performance indicators for tackling racism'. It also proposed that all officers be given 'credit cards' with Macpherson's definition of a race crime on it as an aide memoir . Until the Scottish police sort out these basics - until they can be trusted to know what a race crime is - there's no point trying to draw conclusions from the scant figures they have collected. 'We recognise there is a need to have a better and more comprehensive system,' a spokesman for the Scottish Executive said last week, 'and we will be taking steps to address that.'</p> <p>Questions also hang over the figures for England and Wales. There is little doubt that the statistics represent not a sudden leap in the volume of racist incidents but a sudden leap in their reporting. We must ask, though, whether that willingness to report is consistent across the country. The answer is definitely not. At the same time as the figures on race and the criminal justice system were released, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary issued its third report on the way the 43 constabularies deal with race issues. The Metropolitan and West Midlands police, which reported those comparatively low race crime figures, did receive praise from the Inspectorate for the systems they have put in place to deal with the issue.</p> <p>Another to receive praise was Northumbria police, which recorded the highest rate of race crime in the country. 'I think what these numbers show is that there is a confidence building in the community that we now take this issue seriously,' says Chief Inspector Judith Connon of Northumbria's Community Safety Unit. 'We have developed links with the community and while no one would claim that racist violence has been dealt with ,we are developing systems to help us tackle it.'</p> <p>This is also the view in the community. Zafar Khan is a councillor in Newcastle's West End, where many of the city's ethnic minorities live, and a leader of his mosque. 'Certainly there is racist crime. People receive verbal harassment. My car is scratched. That sort of thing. But now we are making sure these crimes are reported.' Tony Burden, Chief Constable of South Wales, and also president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, puts forward a similar explanation for the high figures on his patch. 'There is absolutely no cause for complacency, but I do think it represents confidence in the way we are working.'</p> <p>Others do not find the police argument convincing. 'The police are always claiming it's about confidence in them,' says Jazz Iheanacho of Race Equality First, a Cardiff organisation. 'We believe it represents the confidence the communities now have in themselves. They are demanding to be taken seriously. If there really was that satisfaction with the police we would not have among our clients so many making racial harassment claims against police officers.'</p> <p>The same question marks lurk over some of the low scores. In Bedfordshire - which includes Luton - racist incidents appear to affect just 0.73 per cent of the ethnic minority population. 'That figure is totally unrepresentative,' says Cyril Dennemont of Bedford's Race Equality Council. 'We are meant to have a race crime forum in this county but it doesn't function at all. We have been appealing for funds for a full-time worker so we can get out there and find out what is going on but we have yet to be given the grant. Anecdotally we know that individual Asian families are getting abused but we have no statistics on it.'</p> <p>Above and beyond the simple issue of raw data is the implicit question of what we do with it. Wringing our hands over the 'sudden' discovery that there is race crime in Britain is not enough. 'We are meant to see this leap in recorded race crime as a source of optimism, but you can be sure the number of racist incidents in Britain since Macpherson certainly haven't gone down,' says Ben Bowling, a law lecturer at King's College London, and an expert on race crime.</p> <p>'What's more, when people come forward to report an incident there is now an expectation that something will be done,' Bowling says. 'But it may not be the case. True, some very important things have happened. The police service now says it is an anti-racist organisation where before it would only say it was neutral on the issue.</p> <p>'The intelligence-based approach that they now have - the gathering of all this data - is vital. The real question is when someone picks up the phone and calls the police what can the officer do to give real reassurance that they will not be victimised again? This is a very long road.'</p> <p>The Met imagines itself to be further down that road than many of the other constabularies in Britain. It has, without doubt, been a terrible week for the Met where race issues are concerned: there was the continuing saga of Gorpal Virdi, the Sikh officer sacked for allegedly sending racist emails to colleagues, and then cleared when he was found to be the victim of racial discrimination by the service; there was outrage from more than 40 officers in Haringey, who claimed they had been libelled in a report on the treatment of Delroy Lindo, a black man whose claim of racial harassment by police has been upheld.</p> <p>And there were the resignations of four members of the Met's Independent Advisory Group on race and diversity, who claimed the body had become an impotent rubber stamp for the service it was meant to advise. Clearly racism will always be a political issue.</p> <p>But even its sternest critics - including those four IAG members, one of whom was Ben Bowling - accept that the Met has made great strides. It did, after all, set up that Independent Advisory Group in the first place. It established the Race Crime Task Force under Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, which has produced the handbook on identifying and combating hate crime for the entire country's police, and which achieved a notable coup when it caught the killers of the black musician Michael Menson. And it has established Community Safety Units (CSU) across the borough.</p> <p>Detective Inspector Sean Cunningham represents that new approach. He is a police officer of 20 years service who was last with the flying squad. He is now head of the CSU in Brent. He speaks the language of diversity policing, and there's no doubt that he means it: 'It's not just about doing the right thing. It's about being seen to do the right thing. We needed to say to the people here in Brent, where we have 50 per cent visible ethnic minorities, that we take race crime seriously.'</p> <p>The Birmingham Racial Harassment Unit knows all about victims. An independent organisation funded from charitable trusts and the local authority, it has 250 clients - up from 100 in the past year - alleging they are the victims of racial violence, crime or discrimination. Tracy, Rudy and Michael are three of them. They each have a story to tell.</p> <p>Tracy, who is white, has two children of mixed parentage who were picked on by her white neighbours. 'They call my kids niggers, black bastards. I made a 999 call to say my daughter had been assaulted and I didn't get a response. They just say it's a neighbourhood dispute.' Has anything changed in the past two years with the police, as far as she is concerned? 'Definitely not. Not at all.'</p> <p>Rudy, who is black, has the same problem: his children get taunted by the neighbours but the police do nothing. 'Once my wife phoned the police and they said \"No one's injured. What can we do?\" '</p> <p>And Michael, who is Jamaican, has been pulled over in his car by police 30 or 40 times but charged with nothing. 'I don't think the police are racist,' he says. 'I know they are.'</p> <p>And this, remember, is the West Midlands apparently one of the safest areas on our map. The problem, according to Maxie Hayles, chairman of the unit, is that whatever high thinking is going on at the top of the police it is not getting down to officers on the beat. ' Listen, victims don't come forward because they want to contribute to statistics. They come through because they are in pain.'</p> <p>Hayles, it should be said, is not completely condemnatory. 'There are good police initiatives. We have sat on police advisory groups. But over the years the police have behaved so badly and so immorally that it's going to take an awfully long time to reform.'</p> <p>Next Saturday marks the second anniversary of the Macpherson report. Much will be said about progress that has been made - and doubtless there has been progress. But as we report on our news pages today, despite all of that, all the heart-searching, all the initiatives, over 70 per cent of the public think the police are still as racist or even more so than they were on 24 February 1999 when Macpherson's report was first published. And where these issues are concerned it is the view of the public - who are, after all, also the victims of racist crime - which counts the most.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

True, some very important things have happened. The police service now says it is an anti-racist organisation where before it would only say it was neutral on the issue. 'The intelligence-based approach that they now have - the gathering of all this data - is vital. The real question is when someone picks up the phone and calls the police what can the officer do to give real reassurance that they will not be victimised again? This is a very long road.' The Met imagines itself to be further down that road than many of the other constabularies in Britain. It has, without doubt, been a terrible week for the Met where race issues are concerned: there was the continuing saga of Gorpal Virdi, the Sikh officer sacked for allegedly sending racist emails to colleagues, and then cleared when he was found to be the victim of racial discrimination by the service; there was outrage from more than 40 officers in Haringey, who claimed they had been libelled in a report on the treatment of Delroy Lindo, a black man whose claim of racial harassment by police has been upheld. And there were the resignations of four members of the Met's Independent Advisory Group on race and diversity, who claimed the body had become an impotent rubber stamp for the service it was meant to advise. Clearly racism will always be a political issue. But even its sternest critics - including those four IAG members, one of whom was Ben Bowling - accept that the Met has made great strides. It did, after all, set up that Independent Advisory Group in the first place. It established the Race Crime Task Force under Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, which has produced the handbook on identifying and combating hate crime for the entire country's police, and which achieved a notable coup when it caught the killers of the black musician Michael Menson. And it has established Community Safety Units (CSU) across the borough. Detective Inspector Sean Cunningham represents that new approach. He is a police officer of 20 years service who was last with the flying squad. He is now head of the CSU in Brent. He speaks the language of diversity policing, and there's no doubt that he means it: 'It's not just about doing the right thing. It's about being seen to do the right thing. We needed to say to the people here in Brent, where we have 50 per cent visible ethnic minorities, that we take race crime seriously.' The Birmingham Racial Harassment Unit knows all about victims. An independent organisation funded from charitable trusts and the local authority, it has 250 clients - up from 100 in the past year - alleging they are the victims of racial violence, crime or discrimination. Tracy, Rudy and Michael are three of them. They each have a story to tell. Tracy, who is white, has two children of mixed parentage who were picked on by her white neighbours. 'They call my kids niggers, black bastards. I made a 999 call to say my daughter had been assaulted and I didn't get a response. They just say it's a neighbourhood dispute.' Has anything changed in the past two years with the police, as far as she is concerned? 'Definitely not. Not at all.' Rudy, who is black, has the same problem: his children get taunted by the neighbours but the police do nothing. 'Once my wife phoned the police and they said \"No one's injured. What can we do?\" ' And Michael, who is Jamaican, has been pulled over in his car by police 30 or 40 times but charged with nothing. 'I don't think the police are racist,' he says. 'I know they are.' And this, remember, is the West Midlands apparently one of the safest areas on our map. The problem, according to Maxie Hayles, chairman of the unit, is that whatever high thinking is going on at the top of the police it is not getting down to officers on the beat. ' Listen, victims don't come forward because they want to contribute to statistics. They come through because they are in pain.' Hayles, it should be said, is not completely condemnatory. 'There are good police initiatives. We have sat on police advisory groups. But over the years the police have behaved so badly and so immorally that it's going to take an awfully long time to reform.' Next Saturday marks the second anniversary of the Macpherson report. Much will be said about progress that has been made - and doubtless there has been progress. But as we report on our news pages today, despite all of that, all the heart-searching, all the initiatives, over 70 per cent of the public think the police are still as racist or even more so than they were on 24 February 1999 when Macpherson's report was first published. And where these issues are concerned it is the view of the public - who are, after all, also the victims of racist crime - which counts the most. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk",

Two years after the publication of Sir William Macpherson's report into the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry, our findings show that one in 12 of the ethnic minority population in Northumbria have reported a racist incident since February 1999, compared with one in 200 in the West Midlands.

Sir John Stevens, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, which serves the country's largest ethnic minority community, last night yesterday described the survey's findings as 'disappointing'. Using official Home Office figures on racist incidents in each constabulary and plotting them against the size of the local ethnic minority population, a startling racial audit shows a country where safety lies in numbers. The most dangerous areas for ethnic minorities are also those where there are the smallest communities.

      "body": "<p>For the first time in four years, I have been involved in television work that is not about gardening. It is not 'about' anything at all, really. The brief is to capture the essence of a place that has a definable local identity, on the basis that although we use big concepts like 'English' or 'Welsh' we are all tribally parochial and our instinct is to belong to quite a small, localised area. Understand these modest identities and, my theory goes, you come closer to an understanding of the real identity of a nation than a sweeping overview. It is a jigsaw. The whole only emerges from the sum of its parts, and the secret is to let the picture assemble itself. </p> <p>When I approach a place for the first time, my instinct is to see what is growing. I want to know what the soil is like and what it wants to produce. If it is in countryside, then the chances are that hedgerows, woods and fields will reveal this quickly enough. Sandy, acidic soil will be betrayed by birches and rhododendrons, hollies, furze and heathers. Chalk cannot help but sprout beeches, hawthorn, yew and fields of barley, whereas rich clay loam will be marked by big oaks and ashes, wheat in the fields and cattle grazing. Chalky air smells different to clay.</p> <p>The landscape gets read like a map. The line and pattern of a hedge is crowded with signs of its past - the sinuous s-shaped curve of the turning single plough that marked out enclosed ridge-and-furrow, or the grid-pattern of later enclosures. The number of different species in a stretch of hedge as the car whizzes by offers further historical evidence, and the angle of trees along the roadside probably says as much about prevailing winds as studious internet weather research.</p> <p>But the most telling feature is the soil itself. Until I have felt it and smelt it and recognised its true colour, I cannot know any place at all. Picking up a handful of earth, I have a connection to the people who live above it. From this comes their building material, their flowers, their water table, their view. This is their cultural gene-bank.</p> <p>But what of towns? Almost all of the above applies here, too. If not your bricks or stones, then your streets and back gardens are shaped more by the soil below them than by the playful artfulness of come-lately designers. You are hornbeam and poplar as much as you are shopping mall and ring road, sycamore and sweet chestnut as much as car park and office block.</p> <p>For the last few weeks of January, I was in London, trying to nail the separateness of Greenwich, the Isle of Dogs, the City, Westminster and Chelsea.

      "bodyText": "For the first time in four years, I have been involved in television work that is not about gardening. It is not 'about' anything at all, really. The brief is to capture the essence of a place that has a definable local identity, on the basis that although we use big concepts like 'English' or 'Welsh' we are all tribally parochial and our instinct is to belong to quite a small, localised area. Understand these modest identities and, my theory goes, you come closer to an understanding of the real identity of a nation than a sweeping overview. It is a jigsaw. The whole only emerges from the sum of its parts, and the secret is to let the picture assemble itself. When I approach a place for the first time, my instinct is to see what is growing. I want to know what the soil is like and what it wants to produce. If it is in countryside, then the chances are that hedgerows, woods and fields will reveal this quickly enough. Sandy, acidic soil will be betrayed by birches and rhododendrons, hollies, furze and heathers. Chalk cannot help but sprout beeches, hawthorn, yew and fields of barley, whereas rich clay loam will be marked by big oaks and ashes, wheat in the fields and cattle grazing. Chalky air smells different to clay. The landscape gets read like a map. The line and pattern of a hedge is crowded with signs of its past - the sinuous s-shaped curve of the turning single plough that marked out enclosed ridge-and-furrow, or the grid-pattern of later enclosures. The number of different species in a stretch of hedge as the car whizzes by offers further historical evidence, and the angle of trees along the roadside probably says as much about prevailing winds as studious internet weather research. But the most telling feature is the soil itself. Until I have felt it and smelt it and recognised its true colour, I cannot know any place at all. Picking up a handful of earth, I have a connection to the people who live above it. From this comes their building material, their flowers, their water table, their view. This is their cultural gene-bank. But what of towns? Almost all of the above applies here, too. If not your bricks or stones, then your streets and back gardens are shaped more by the soil below them than by the playful artfulness of come-lately designers. You are hornbeam and poplar as much as you are shopping mall and ring road, sycamore and sweet chestnut as much as car park and office block. For the last few weeks of January, I was in London, trying to nail the separateness of Greenwich, the Isle of Dogs, the City, Westminster and Chelsea. Even the muddled tangle of the capital, with its identities squeezed and saturated like a bathtime sponge, revealed its identity as much in the little corners of its gardens as in its towers and monuments. Starting at the Dome on the Greenwich peninsula, the landscaping was finished and confident, with ranks of young trees staked and tied cheek by jowl - a landscaping trick that is used to provide protection for the growing trees before they mature and can be thinned.

It includes intimate details not only of her 32-year relationship with Wilcox and the triumphs of their television work together but also of his painful death shortly after they had re-celebrated their marriage vows.

      "bodyText": "It has all the compelling ingredients of Esther , the hit daytime TV show. First, the devoted widow discloses the heart-rending circumstances of her husband's recent death. Quite unembarrassed, she shares his touching last moments with millions. Then she tantalisingly hints at the bitterness she still feels towards his first wife. Enter with dramatic flourish the aggrieved step-daughter. Her father's apparently blonde second wife was once a 'toothy overweight brunette', she claims, who has a craven desire for publicity and has shown terrible insensitivity towards her entire family. But these are not ordinary folk from middle Britain, the normal protagonists on Esther Rantzen's afternoon programme. This time, the devoted widow is Miss Rantzen herself. And the embittered step-daughter is Cassandra, the child of legendary TV producer Desmond Wilcox, to whom Rantzen was happily and very publicly devoted for 32 years. Last week, Esther - who became a huge TV star 30 years ago as host of BBC1's That's Life - published the first extracts from her autobiography. It includes intimate details not only of her 32-year relationship with Wilcox and the triumphs of their television work together but also of his painful death shortly after they had re-celebrated their marriage vows. She said of Wilcox: 'He radiated warmth and light into our lives and for the moment we fear that we have lost the sunshine we depended on.' But yesterday Cassandra retaliated, with a barrage of accusations of inaccuracy, cruelty and unpleasantness. 'Esther has claimed that when my father was dying, he took off his oxygen mask and gave her \"a kiss so passionate that it made the children blush\".

      "body": "<p>'Hey ya'll. Is this the parole office?' A podgy little man with a bumfluff beard and glasses, wearing baggy shorts and a purple, tie-dyed T-shirt, is standing in the doorway, peering in at the people inside, trying to find a familiar face. They laugh. In fact, they're tempted to play along with the joke and tell him, in a parody of his Southern accent: 'Yes, suh - and we're setting y'all free!' But the laughter just makes him all the more confused and suddenly the penny drops. This is not a member of the visiting film crew playing a prank on the others - he's a real-life criminal, checking in. </p> <p>What used to be the parole office is now a makeshift workstation for the cast and crew of The Gift, a supernatural thriller directed by Sam Raimi and being shot on location in Savannah, Georgia. Raimi is a maverick whose exhilarating camerawork came to prominence in the dizzying, bloody Evil Dead series. But like his 1997 thriller, A Simple Plan, The Gift is a much more muted affair, resting on a grounded performance by Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett, herself taking a break from more serious projects. But while the star is Blanchett, the revelation is Keanu Reeves. He plays Donnie Barksdale, six snarling feet of redneck fury and the abusive husband of Valerie (Hilary Swank), turning his clean-cut Matrix messiah boy image on its head. </p> <p>Reeves is anxious not to be typecast. In the same week The Gift is released here, we'll also see him in The Watcher, in which he plays Griffin, a serial killer who teases the FBI by staging elaborate murders and laying false trails. But where Griffin is a cold, elusive psychopath, whose good looks seem actually superfluous to the role, Barksdale is a physically intimidating bully who, in one especially well-crafted scene, bursts into Annie's house and drags his screaming wife out by the hair. </p> <p>It's all very far from the Gen-X clown capers of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure or the high-cheekbone heroics of Speed and the Wachowski brothers' The Matrix. And when he makes his entrance, taking a break between shots, Reeves is an impressive presence. He looks much bigger - taller and wider - than his usual, lean self and his new bulk is squeezed into a cheap, polyester WalMart suit. Although not technically in character, he's adopted some of Donnie Barksdale's mannerisms for the time being, lolling back in his chair and making strong, assertive gestures with his arms and shoulders. Taking the guise of a good ol' boy, just sitting there, hanging out, like a regular Joe. But his eyes seem nervous and distant, as though someone else is inside, working the machinery. </p> <p>Today, they're filming a courtroom scene, with Keanu in the dock, and because it requires some concentration he will be conducting the interview in a Southern accent. Thankfully, this has improved somewhat since his turn in the awful horror thriller, The Devil's Advocate. His hair straggles at his shirt collar and a weird, angular beard, grows in clumps on his chin. 'Sam wanted me to be less recognisable and it just started to grow,' he explains. 'So we decided not to cut it.' </p> <p>Reeves has been working on this new 'look' for several weeks now. 'I didn't want to just play \"a Southerner\", you know?' he says. 'And in working with the dialect coach, all of us tried to find a certain region that our characters were from. And then, once we'd decided on a region, I found a county called Rankin and went there. No one could believe it. I'd come back to the set and people would be, like, \"Rankin? What were you doing thar ?\"' </p> <p>There are several myths surrounding this 36-year-old actor. One is that he is inarticulate and moody. Indeed, before he finally appears, it is even suggested that he might not speak at all; he is, variously, 'tired', 'ill' and 'working on an intense scene'. Another is that, well, he's simply not an actor. But despite the oddness of talking to someone in character, Reeves gives a surprisingly good account of himself. He's not exactly a Method actor, but he's willing put his back into it. </p> <p>'When I first got here,' he says, 'I just couldn't get it. Then I went out to a couple of bars and I met a couple of guys. Suddenly I was like, \"Oh, right, that's what I gotta get\". Because there's something about people from the South, they just exude where they're from. I wanted to get that down, so that if I just walked into a room, people would think, \"Whoah, that's a redneck!\"' </p> <p>So he hired a souped-up pick-up truck, bought a hat and a pair of boots and checked out the local nightlife. </p> <p>'A couple of times it's been good,' he says, 'but there's a certain style in Rankin that's just confrontational. They come up to you and sort of test you. They push you - like, \"Where you from?\" They might make fun of where you're from or what you look like. In a nice way, smiling. And then they see how you respond. </p> <p>'I remember I went into Rankin once and this pick-up truck pulled up next to me and I got scared. This black truck, with black windows, a Confederate flag, a gun rack, antennae.' </p> <p>His voice drops to an almost conspiratorial level and his shoulders snap back, as if he's about to reveal that something bad happened. But nothing did happen; the truck (presumably) drove away. And for the first time, it's possible to see a glimpse of the real Keanu Reeves beneath Donnie Barksdale's bravado, the unshaven, grungy figure who turned up at the Glastonbury festival two years back with his ropey band, Dogstar, wearing a grubby black suit and woolly hat jammed down over his ears. The Keanu Reeves who literally answered the first three questions of a press conference there with the following, unforgettable answers: 'No', 'No' and 'Uh, we just got here.' </p> <p>Donnie Barksdale seems to be getting under his skin and the result, he says, is his temper is closer to the surface. 'I call it my Donnie,' he chuckles. 'Like, \"I gotta get my Donnie on\", you know?' </p> <p>Is it difficult juggling these personalities? </p> <p>'Sometimes, it can take a while to get back,' he nods. 'It means, if it's been very intense, some of the habits and ways of being kind of come with you back home and you kind of have to readjust to your life. For me sometimes, it's so great to have change. When you get back, sometimes, it's like your relationships and where you're at kind of puts you back into the rhythm of how you were before you left. Sometimes, I find myself trying not to do that. But then there's other times when I miss how I was, or am. So there's always a kind of schism.' </p> <p>Reeves's commitment will be put to the test in his next two films, which for 16 months will take him to Australia and plunge him back into the world of The Matrix. Reeves is saying nothing except that he has the scripts, which he's very pleased with, although internet rumours suggest that his character, Neo, will develop new superpowers and do battle with a new crew of supervillains who weave in and out of the storyline. 'They're going to film two films, but not in order,' he says. </p> <p>So how much training will that require? </p> <p>'Basic training is four months, and my first fight after that won't be for another month and a half. So it's more like five months.' </p> <p>Is there much pressure to deliver two more hits? </p> <p>'I'm sure there is, especially for the directors. But I like that pressure. I know when I made The Matrix it was important for me to be there every day and be ready. I had this vision of a mountain, like, \"OK, do what you have to do but get there\". I enjoyed that, I think because I'm just part of the film. It's not like I'm carrying the film the way Mel Gibson carried the Lethal Weapon series. I'm part of The Matrix.' </p> <p>And what can we expect this time round? </p> <p> 'What they're doing with some of the digital aspects that are available now is amazing; technology has been developed that will allow the brothers, Andy and Larry, to move the camera around sequences that have never been done before. They want the actors to do more, and we're gonna be using even more weapons this time.' </p> <p>Before this, Keanu will be concentrating on a couple of smaller movies, starting with a weepie called Sweet November, with Charlize Theron. Is he ever disappointed by the scripts he gets? Does he ever feel typecast as an action bimbo? </p> <p>'I find it...' </p> <p>(Suddenly, the familiar, hesitant Keanu emerges and it becomes apparent that he's struggling to keep up the fa\u00e7ade. Though he's trying to be sociable and outgoing, it just doesn't seem to come naturally and his eyes maintain a definite aversion strategy. Beneath the Donnie Barksdale persona is still the reluctant star who feels uncomfortable with attention and who reacts with abrupt defensiveness. And it quickly becomes apparent that Reeves is perhaps even marginalised in his own profession. He isn't merely an actor, he's a movie star and desperately needs to be taken seriously, hence the deep-cover research, the accent, the 'Donnie'.) </p> <p>'I find it mixed,' he decides. 'You see a lot of clich\u00e9s, you see a lot of people following other people who've broken ground, then you get scripts you can relate to - like, \"Wow, that's the truth! That's good\". But those movies are few and far between. It seems like with American movies it's hard to get, not day to day stuff, but stuff like [Todd Solondz's] Happiness. Or even American Beauty, where you have a simple storyline and people are able to just \"be real\" and tell the story through that. On the surface, that doesn't seem to be interesting and yet those are the films that people remember. Those are the films that are hard to find, those simple stories that are as big as life, as opposed to spectacle.' </p> <p>And at that moment, the publicist appears, ready to whisk him back to the set. </p> <p>\"I appreciate it,' he drawls, before shaking hands. 'Have a good day, man.' </p> <p><strong>Keanu Reeves: the real thing</strong></p> <p><strong> Born </strong> 2 September 1964, Beirut, Lebanon.

      "body": "<p>The Rewrite </p> <p> In an early draft of Liam, the title character saw a prostitute plying her trade. His young head couldn't make sense of this but he vaguely knew it was sinful, something he had to tell the priest at his first confession. Thus began Liam's dramatic journey. Not a great start, I told myself, but it did its job. I emailed the draft to Stephen Frears. </p> <p>Stephen summoned me to the office. I found him poring over the script. I waited, pencil poised. 'This bit here,' he said, pointing to the prostitute scene, 'it's er, it's er...' I licked my pencil. Any moment now, a brilliant insight from the great director. 'It's not quite good enough,' he said. And that was it. </p> <p>I got home, opened a bottle and paced the floor all night. 'Not quite good enough.' What kind of a script note was that? Some middle-class Jew reads a working-class Catholic script and all he can say is, 'It's not quite good enough.' </p> <p>Halfway down the bottle I realised that that was the best note I'd ever been given. What Stephen had said to me, in effect, was this: 'Look, I can't tell you what should be there; this is your story, not mine. And it's truthful and it comes from the heart. But the prostitute scene isn't truthful. It's simply a scene that does its job. Replace it with a scene that does the job and comes from the heart.' </p> <p>So I thought back to when I was Liam's age and I walked into the back kitchen and saw my mother naked. I saw, too, her pubic hair and for months after that I thought my mother was deformed. </p> <p>I had thought of describing this incident early on in my career, particularly in the first episodes of Cracker . But my mother was still alive; I loved her so much; I didn't want her to think anything she had done, no matter how innocently, had traumatised me. But now she was dead, so I wrote it. And, looking at it now, it seems (the acid test of rewrites) that it was always there - so central is it to Liam's story, so organic . </p> <p>I asked Stephen if I could follow him on the shoot. Up to this point I'd always locked myself in my room when the cameras rolled - apart from Hillsborough, of course, when I couldn't keep away - but here was a chance to watch Stephen Frears in action. I grabbed it. </p> <p> <strong> The Shoot</strong> </p> <p> Stephen worked like this. </p> <p>He'd pull a tatty page out of his back pocket - the little piece of my script he intended to shoot. 'Inch by motherfucking inch,' he'd say, quoting Oliver Stone. 'That's how films are made. Inch by motherfucking inch.' </p> <p>He'd assemble the actors. 'How do you want to do this?' he'd say. This would dumbfound those actors used to directors instructing them, but most of them responded enthusiastically, chipping in with actions, movements, etc. Stephen would veto some, accept some and then turn to Andrew Dunn (the best cameraman I've ever seen, a genius) and say, 'Can we do this, Andrew?' </p> <p>Andrew would move around the set, arms swinging for tracking shots, hands plunging forward for close-ups. Stephen would nod, nod, interject and, finally satisfied, he'd say, 'Let's do it.' </p> <p>Now I know that sounds ridiculously simple. I know I'm talking of a cameraman and director steeped in experience, knowledge and technique but, for the life of me, I cannot think of a better way to shoot a scene. </p> <p>Not all went smoothly, but at times of crisis Stephen would walk into the middle of the set, spread his hands in mock-despair and, like a little-boy-lost, announce to the world, 'I don't know what to do.' People would then steam in from all directions. The cameraman would suggest something, the sound man, props, make-up, design, even catering. </p> <p>Stephen, wise old dog, would take everything offered, assimilate it, synthesise it and, problem solved, the shoot would continue. This taught me a fundamental truth. People who work in film want to give . And only a fool would refuse to take from them. </p> <p> <strong> Post-production</strong> </p> <p> Stephen shot the entire script (a rarity in the British film industry), took it to London and left me kicking my heels in Liverpool. But a week or two later I was able to see the first rough assembly. It was love at first sight: every scene beautifully shot, perfectly acted, and all in the order in which I had written them. In my ecstasy I didn't hear the ominous warnings from Stephen that further work was needed. </p> <p>Further work was done and I sat down at home and watched the result. Now look, nobody told me that this was work in progress. Nobody told me that this was Stephen trying things out. I just sat down in total ignorance and watched this latest cut. Watched with mounting horror. When it finished, I opened up a bottle and drank and drank and drank. Three-quarters down the bottle I phoned Colin McKeown, the co-producer. This is roughly what I said. </p> <p> That bastard Frears. He's tossed my script in the air, seen how it landed, and cut it accordingly. I spent years on that structure, Colin. Years. And he's chopping and changing it after two lousy weeks in the edit suite. He's a middle-class Jew (my ace, this; I'd played it repeatedly throughout the shoot) and this is a working-class Catholic film. Talk to him! </p> <p>My wife, Eileen, told me I was wrong to scream at Colin. This assembly was Stephen's doing and it was Stephen I should berate. I downed the rest of the bottle, picked up the phone and repeated the whole thing into Stephen Frears's answer-machine. Look, nobody told me he was just trying things out. </p> <p>Next morning I woke with a guilt-fuelled hangover. This was not the first time in my life I'd woken with a guilt-fuelled hangover, but hitherto the flashbacks had made me cringe every hour. These made me cringe every 10 seconds. </p> <p>I faxed Stephen, gave it an hour for my grovelling to sink in, then phoned to grovel even more. He was ultra-polite, but the subtext I heard beneath every sentence (although Stephen will deny it) was: Fuck you, you ungrateful, drunken Scouser. A good relationship with a top-class director - wrecked in five drunken minutes. Why did I do it? </p> <p> <strong> Do you really need the shark?</strong> </p> <p> As a writer, your early years (in some cases all your years) are full of rejections. Then, one day, someone says he'll produce your script. You're delighted obviously but, above all, you're grateful . He tells you it's a wonderful script but his budget is limited, so the scene on the banks of the Mersey, could you live with doing it in the main character's back room? Yes, you say. And could you live without the helicopter? Oh yes. He suggests other rewrites. They'll take you a week at least, but could you have them done by teatime tomorrow? Yes, yes, yes. </p> <p>British producer, on the first draft of Jaws: Do you really need the shark? </p> <p>You go on saying yes throughout your career. If you were to say no, if you were to fight for the things you believed in, they'd label you 'difficult' (which is bad) or 'precious' (even worse) and you'd never work again. So all the time, through compromise after compromise, you suppress a frustrated monster within you until, emboldened by rage or drugs or alcohol, it bursts forth and wrecks everything in sight. When this happens, you tell yourself you're simply asserting the primacy of the writer. But, the morning after, you realise you should have done it without the alibi of rage, drugs or alcohol, you should have done it in the cold sober light of day, but that was impossible because, in the cold sober light of day, all a writer ever says is yes, yes, yes. </p> <p> To order Jimmy McGovern's Liam screenplay (ScreenPress Books \u00a37.99) for \u00a35.99 plus p&amp;p, call 0800 3168 171.

In my ecstasy I didn't hear the ominous warnings from Stephen that further work was needed. Further work was done and I sat down at home and watched the result. Now look, nobody told me that this was work in progress. Nobody told me that this was Stephen trying things out. I just sat down in total ignorance and watched this latest cut. Watched with mounting horror. When it finished, I opened up a bottle and drank and drank and drank. Three-quarters down the bottle I phoned Colin McKeown, the co-producer. This is roughly what I said. That bastard Frears. He's tossed my script in the air, seen how it landed, and cut it accordingly. I spent years on that structure, Colin. Years. And he's chopping and changing it after two lousy weeks in the edit suite. He's a middle-class Jew (my ace, this; I'd played it repeatedly throughout the shoot) and this is a working-class Catholic film. Talk to him! My wife, Eileen, told me I was wrong to scream at Colin. This assembly was Stephen's doing and it was Stephen I should berate. I downed the rest of the bottle, picked up the phone and repeated the whole thing into Stephen Frears's answer-machine. Look, nobody told me he was just trying things out. Next morning I woke with a guilt-fuelled hangover. This was not the first time in my life I'd woken with a guilt-fuelled hangover, but hitherto the flashbacks had made me cringe every hour. These made me cringe every 10 seconds. I faxed Stephen, gave it an hour for my grovelling to sink in, then phoned to grovel even more. He was ultra-polite, but the subtext I heard beneath every sentence (although Stephen will deny it) was: Fuck you, you ungrateful, drunken Scouser. A good relationship with a top-class director - wrecked in five drunken minutes. Why did I do it? Do you really need the shark? As a writer, your early years (in some cases all your years) are full of rejections. Then, one day, someone says he'll produce your script. You're delighted obviously but, above all, you're grateful . He tells you it's a wonderful script but his budget is limited, so the scene on the banks of the Mersey, could you live with doing it in the main character's back room? Yes, you say. And could you live without the helicopter? Oh yes. He suggests other rewrites. They'll take you a week at least, but could you have them done by teatime tomorrow? Yes, yes, yes. British producer, on the first draft of Jaws: Do you really need the shark? You go on saying yes throughout your career. If you were to say no, if you were to fight for the things you believed in, they'd label you 'difficult' (which is bad) or 'precious' (even worse) and you'd never work again. So all the time, through compromise after compromise, you suppress a frustrated monster within you until, emboldened by rage or drugs or alcohol, it bursts forth and wrecks everything in sight. When this happens, you tell yourself you're simply asserting the primacy of the writer. But, the morning after, you realise you should have done it without the alibi of rage, drugs or alcohol, you should have done it in the cold sober light of day, but that was impossible because, in the cold sober light of day, all a writer ever says is yes, yes, yes.

      "body": "<p>Billy Bob Thornton is waking up. He's been working a lot, making a lot of movies, so he's tired. He's been making a record, too, after hours. The voice of Johnny Cash, in duet with Billy Bob's own voice, streams from the speakers. They sound pretty good together. Marty Stuart, the producer, is up from Nashville, and he's burning CDs tonight here at the studio, and it's late, after 2am, all the girls have gone home, and Marty's switched from champagne to Mountain Dew. This is the first time he's heard the full mix. 'This record is tryin' to be something.' He says to Jim, the engineer. 'It's comin', it's comin', it's comin'. I see its little head.' </p> <p>Billy Bob's been asleep on the couch, which is funny, because normally he needs to be told to go to sleep, and Marty says this is the most rest he's gotten since 1979. 'I've wore his ass out,' Marty says, even though he's known Billy Bob only a couple years. As Billy Bob's mother says, her boy's been 'keeping the roads hot'. It's a composed sleep, no more than a half-hour or so - his face has not gone slack - and it seems as if he's beginning to stir. His hands are still folded between his knees, his head bowed, chin to his chest. His cap, which reads Henry Swing Club, is pulled low. His skin is amber, the colour of whiskey. A short-sleeved bowling shirt covers most of his tattoos, but one peeks out from under his left sleeve. He wears a black leather band on one wrist and black jeans and black tasselled motorcycle boots, which are starting to show signs of life. He is a parched and worn 45, but in sleep he has the aspect of a baby. People want to stay around and make sure nothing bad happens to him. A hand goes up to his face, an index finger softly rubs the bridge of his nose, and then the hand goes slack as he dissolves again into sleep. He is clean-shaven. He looks like a farmer, not a movie star. </p> <p>This is Billy Bob's couch, in the recording studio that also belongs to him, in the basement of his new house in Beverly Hills. He's owned the place since June, just after he got married to Angelina Jolie - he calls her Angie - and they paid more than $3m for it. The house is 11,000sqft, and it has this recording studio in the basement, which is a big reason Billy Bob wanted it. Slash, the former guitarist for Guns N' Roses, lived here before. Billy Bob's a Hollywood guy, yes, but his music is important to him, and this is not going to be one of those actor-wants-to-be-a-rock-star records, so he doesn't talk about it much. But the studio is a comfortable room, and he likes it. He hasn't really unpacked yet. Boxes are stacked against one wall alongside a framed Pink Floyd poster. There are a couple of oriental rugs, an acoustic guitar, a box labelled Billy Bob's Drum Kit. </p> <p>Billy Bob lifts his head and squints for a second, and then suddenly he is all awake, as if he had never been asleep. He hears Johnny Cash. 'I think his voice is a little hot,' he says softly. Marty's sitting at the soundboard. He adjusts a few knobs. Billy Bob wonders if they should get Cash to record his vocals again. Marty says, 'It's easier to sing to Mount Rushmore than to have Mount Rushmore sing to you.' Then Marty says, 'Time to go, cuz. OK, enough work for tonight. Time to go to bed.' </p> <p>Billy Bob gets to his feet and heads upstairs. He scrapes his heels when he walks, as if the boots are weighing him down. On the landing, he passes a huge arrow pointing back down to the studio. There's a sign on it that reads The Snakepit. Upstairs, the house is a construction zone. Only one room is finished. Newspapers mask the floors. Buckets of paint are stacked along the walls in the foyer. Angie's in London, working, so he's in charge of the renovation. The bedrooms on the second floor all have sliding glass doors that overlook a small outdoor pool. Billy Bob likes the fact that it has the feel of a motel and wants to preserve that. 'I'll never live a normal life,' he says. 'But I try to keep bits of it in my life. Just the idea of having a house, of buying one, knowing there's someplace to call home.' </p> <p>He walks over, flips off the big TV, which has been playing on mute all night, and then goes to the front door. 'Come on, we're goin',' he says. He steps out, lights a cigarette, and locks the door. He won't be sleeping here. 'Nooo sir,' he says, heading for his truck. 'Not until a guy comes and checks the place out for snake eggs.' </p> <p>The house may have a snake problem. Slash liked snakes and kept them in cages and boxes and pens all over the house. Billy Bob can't abide snakes. He hasn't yet spent the night in the house, and he won't until the snake-egg guy comes. </p> <p>He doesn't live in places easily. He once lived in New York City for 10 hours before driving back to Arkansas, defeated and afraid. Tonight he's going to sleep at the Sunset Marquis, the hotel where he's lived off and on for years. </p> <p>When he gets to the hotel, he'll call his bride, who'll just be starting her day. Well, maybe he'll call her. He's not sure. 'It's one of the things I like about this marriage,' he says. 'I was always afraid in relationships before, but I'm not afraid of her. Well, I am afraid of her, I told her that once. First I told her I wasn't afraid of her, and then 20 minutes later I told her the opposite, that I was afraid of her.' So maybe he'll call. </p> <p>This is an early evening for him. He's got to get up at six to cut hair because he's in a movie. He's playing a barber. </p> <p>It's a great night out, warm, swimming weather, but all the Beverly Hills mansions on Billy Bob's street, all built during the same few years - late 20s, early 30s - for the first generation of Hollywood royalty, are dark now. Who could be in bed on a night like this? It's going on 3am, and so Billy Bob's boots and his voice echo a little as he shuffles towards his truck. He's looking at the dark houses. 'I hate people who go to sleep early,' he says. </p> <p> <strong> 11pm, second night </strong></p> <p>Billy Bob will never live a normal life. So he went to work today, made some film, negotiated some deal. All real work in the adult world. A bunch of extras lined up at sunrise for haircuts. 'Most nervous extras you ever saw,' Billy Bob says. He gave a couple of flat-tops with antique clippers. It's a Coen brothers film, known currently as The Untitled Barber Project. He is, by all accounts, a delight to be around with on the set, any set. He is kind, funny and inspiring to other actors, and reverential about the work, having had a strange sense of hillbilly destiny about it ever since his mother told him not to worry, he's made it, one day he would work with Burt Reynolds. (He has.) </p> <p>He's got six movies coming out in the next year, four of which he's acting in and two of which he directed, including All the Pretty Horses, the $45m-adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, and The Gift, which he wrote about his mother - both films are due out in the UK next month. He's never been busier and never been more tired; he's got a cough and there's so much day-time work, too, so many decisions to make, so many people to take care of, so much writing to get done, so many stories to get out of himself before it's too late. </p> <p>'I've got so much shit backed up that it almost gives me an aneurysm,' he says. 'I've got at least another 20 movies in me.' </p> <p>But after dark, Billy Bob's mind seems so starved that he won't sleep voluntarily or easily; he never has since he was a kid, and at these times he has been known even to seek out the interesting company of those he doesn't know very well, and he is disappointed when they don't have the stamina for his hours. 'Oh, no, come on, you can't leave!' he'll say. </p> <p>The bar at his hotel is called the Whiskey, and the candlelit patio out front, with its low wrought-iron tables, is Billy Bob's nocturnal office. There's always somebody or somebody's entourage here. Blonde, lithe young things everywhere. And lots of musicians; there's a recording studio in the basement here, too. And everybody touches everybody else. Little touches, lots of hands, which is fine with Billy Bob because he's from the South, and there they drape themselves all over you. </p> <p>Billy Bob keeps pretty regular hours here, and the Reverend Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top drops by sometimes. He's here tonight, and this is cool because it was not very long ago at all that Billy Bob was the completely unfamous drummer of a ZZ tribute band, Tres Hombres, which Gibbons now graciously calls 'the best little cover band in Texas'. And earlier, Billy Bob jammed in an upstairs room with Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes. And now the Irish director Jim Sheridan pulls up a chair, and Billy Bob talks to him about boxing movies because that's something that Sheridan knows about, and Billy Bob's thinking about directing a boxing movie for Miramax, even though he's said no to all studio films, forever ('Well, at least with Miramax you know whose ass you're kissing'), and lord knows how he'll find the time and preserve his health, but he's already seeing scenes in his head, so he figures it's the right thing to do. </p> <p>Life at the Sunset Marquis has other rewards. There's a gym that Billy Bob uses when he finds himself in bouts of self-improvement. He sometimes works out in his cowboy-and-Indian pjs, and he'll wear Angie's pink underwear. 'Once I was lifting weights, and I thought they were hidden, but some guy kept looking at me strange,' he says. 'Finally, I said, \"They're my wife's.\" I don't think it's strange at all. I wear them to the set some days. I like having her close to me, you know?' </p> <p>Another good thing about the hotel is that everybody knows him here, and the bartenders at the Whiskey are as much as he'll indulge himself in psychotherapy any more. Along the way, he's entered therapy a few times and even tried it with a couple of his ex-wives when things started souring. But he doesn't trust it. 'People in LA think you learn by therapy. But you learn by living. I mean, if you've got to get over having your puppy run over when you were nine, fine, but you've got to keep living. </p> <p>'See, I've fucked a lot of things up. I've been wrong. In relationships, I've been, like, not present. Or doing some wrong things. People talk about working on things. I don't like to work on things. I never like working on things. When I write, I don't work on it. I start, and I finish. If it don't come out in one long stream of consciousness, it ain't for me. I don't want to construct when I love, when I write. I don't want to go to couples therapy to solve a relationship. I don't want to work on it. I don't believe in it, never have.' </p> <p>Billy Bob had been with the actress Laura Dern for three years when she went off to make a movie. When she got back, Billy Bob was married to Angie. He knows that lots of people out here are sympathetic to Dern's side of things. 'Others may say that you left our girl and married someone else,' he says. 'But it made me happy and somebody else happy. I'm sorry it caused pain.' </p> <p>As the evening unwinds and the foot traffic slows down, Billy Bob chain-smokes and drinks bottles of water and hangs out, talking about All the Pretty Horses and his idea of the movies. He finished the film some time ago but continues to edit, tweak and fight battles over every little thing. He went to test screenings. He knows the audience out there is finicky. 'You've got people who only want to see someone screw an apple pie. But some people are sick and tired of it. They want raw stuff again. We did the movie the way they used to do it.' </p> <p> All the Pretty Horses is a modern epic, with 'interiors out of Sling Blade ' and 'outdoors that look like John Ford', with a big budget and big stars, directed by a guy who's never been trusted with more than a few million dollars before. 'I think the natural tendency these days is to use one of the big guys to direct. I'm not one of them.' </p> <p>Out of nowhere, someone asks, 'When are you going to London?' Billy Bob's fear of flying is famous. Before he gets on a plane, he'll call his mother, who is psychic, to ask her if it's safe. He'll go over there on one condition, he says - if Angie'll take him on the Jack the Ripper tour. </p> <p>It's quiet for a minute, and then Billy Bob speaks. 'You know she won't do anything to hurt me, because she knows it'll hurt her more,' he says. </p> <p>Billy Bob orders more cigarettes and gets up to pee. As he's walking back, he's already talking. He seems excited, maybe exercised. 'Did you ever look at a woman when she's asleep, and you think, who the fuck is that ?' he says, and sits down. 'And, like, the moonlight's coming in when you're sleeping next to her at night and you can kind of see her face - and she looks like a fucking monster ? This might be somebody you have been with for years. And you look at her, and it's like, who in God's name is that? Why - she's a stranger. What is she doing here? I don't even know her. And much of the daytime, you're like, \"Oh, honey, I love you. Are you OK? How was that today?\" But when she's asleep, that's how you really feel about her.' </p> <p> <strong> 8pm, same night </strong></p> <p>Billy Bob bleeds [St Louise] Cardinal red, but the Dodgers will do for tonight. He got good tickets and decided to catch a game. Back in Malvern, Arkansas, Billy Bob was a hometown baseball hero, the promising kid who got a major league try-out at 18, got nailed by a bad throw, and broke his collarbone. 'There's nothing in the movies or entertainment that feels like the third pitch that strikes a guy out,' he says. </p> <p>Billy Bob remembers that his father hung a tyre up in the yard so that he could practise his pitching. 'It's the one place my dad and I connected every now and then,' he says. He looks around Dodger Stadium, shrugs his shoulders, and squints. 'Or maybe that's my fantasy.' </p> <p>Billy Bob was not close to his father. Billy Ray Thornton was gone a lot, teaching and coaching mostly basketball at small high schools out of town. Billy Bob says that every film he does is reckoning with his father. 'In my movies, there's either shitty fathers, absent fathers, fathers that you want their approval. Or the father's just not there. He died or whatever.' </p> <p>After the game, Billy Bob's in the car talking on the phone to his most recent ex-wife, Pietra, with whom he has two young sons. 'Don't make any plans for Friday night. We can make a dessert like strawberry shortcake or something like that.' He's sweet and kind to her now. It's late, but his kids aren't asleep. One of his boys announces over the phone that he's trying to kill a spider. 'Your mom ripped his body off? Wait, what - the spider's on his back, shivering with a chicken bone in his mouth? Well, that's a huge spider. Oh, that's the dog. OK, honey, did your mom tell you that I'm coming Friday night and we're gonna cook? We're gonna make something, just you and your brother and me and your mom. You sure are, baby, you are the luckiest boy. I love you. Goodnight, baby.' </p> <p> <strong> 1am, first night</strong> </p> <p>The house is rockin', sort of. In the one finished room, Billy Bob's trying to convince Odessa, his young assistant, that he always wanted to 'fuck a midget'. </p> <p>'I always wanted to fuck a midget,' he tells her in earnest. 'I just wanted to see what it was like. I don't any more. But didn't you ever want to?' </p> <p>'No!' Odessa yelps in a slurry North Carolina accent. She's 25, pretty, and has worked with Billy Bob for a couple of years. </p> <p>'I always wanted to just pick them up by the ankles,' Billy Bob goes on. 'Think of all the things you could do with 'em. You can pick 'em up, turn 'em upside down by their ankles.' He holds up an imaginary midget, shakes it a little. </p> <p>Then he's slow dancing, loving the midget up and down. Odessa backs off a bit. Kristin, another assistant, is on the couch with Odessa's pit bull, Percy, giggling. </p> <p>'I've seen midgets fucking,' Billy Bob says. </p> <p>'You've seen it?' Odessa asks. </p> <p>'Of course!' he says </p> <p>'What do you mean, of course ? Like everybody has?' </p> <p>'Not like everybody else has,' he says. 'Like I have.' </p> <p>'I don't ever want to see that,' Odessa says. 'It's just wrong.' </p> <p>Marty Stuart comes whistling up from the studio. 'More bubbly?' Billy Bob asks, cackling. He's broken out champagne, ecstatic that he wrote a new song tonight. And that's as good a reason as any to make this night the first party in the new house. </p> <p>'Slash had a room full of iguanas over there.' Billy Bob points past the bar. 'Man, I can't stand a lizard. I don't like that skin, I don't like the way they look.' Percy the pit bull ambles over and rubs against Billy Bob's leg. The dog's got a long, mean scar on his back. Odessa rescued him from somewhere up in the Hollywood Hills. It's one of the things Billy likes about Odessa, that her heart's so big. Another thing is that she genuinely doesn't seem to know or care who's famous and who's not, except for the day she saw Rhea Perlman [Carla from Cheers ] on the street and just about lost it. </p> <p>'Marty and I were talking today,' Billy Bob says, 'about how in the South it's all right to beat a dog.' </p> <p>He and Marty are trying to work each other up. </p> <p>'It's a kind of a way of life,' Marty says. Both men are laughing, their shoulders shaking. 'There's a place in Nashville,' Marty says. 'where you could get braces for your dog's teeth. The dog dentist. If your dog had buckteeth, you could get him braces.' </p> <p>'Oh, well, that's just ridiculous,' Odessa says. </p> <p>'Not if you're a buck-toothed dog!' Billy Bob says. </p> <p>Ime Etuk walks in, a soft-spoken black man in his twenties. Ime's an assistant director around town and Billy Bob's bowling buddy. </p> <p>'You got a marijuana cigarette?' Billy Bob asks Ime. </p> <p>'Not on me,' Ime says. </p> <p>Billy Bob is happy and loose, and he wants to have fun. He wants to have fun like Sinatra did, all night and whatever the hell he wanted. He can't wait for the house to be up and running so that he can get a little of that Southern Rat Pack feeling. A pool table, table football, and a Velcro room of his own design. </p> <p>'Where are all my bitches?' Billy Bob cries out. 'I know I have more bitches than this! Odessa, call people! Tell 'em to come over!' </p> <p>'We tried to call everybody,' Kristin says. 'We told them it was a pyjama party.' </p> <p>'What's wrong with the world?' Billy Bob says. </p> <p>'Everybody's tired,' Kristin says. </p> <p>'Well I'm tired, too .' </p> <p> Alex, Billy Bob's chef, shows up, along with a blonde actress and a producer and a guy in a suit. Alex says that during the filming of All the Pretty Horses, she had to call Arkansas to 'find out from his momma how to make chocolate gravy and biscuits'. Billy Bob veers into a story about the night he saw a man barking his ass off in a grocery store. This was in Santa Fe late at night, after a day of shooting All the Pretty Horses , when Billy Bob and a couple of the girls were looking for a midnight snack. 'We've always been addicted to various kinds of cereal,' Billy Bob says. </p> <p>'Cap'n Crunch!' Odessa says. </p> <p>'Golden Grahams!' Kristin says. </p> <p>'There was a guy there barking his ass off, just throwing his head back, doing the whole thing. I love that shit. I love that shit!' </p> <p>The party never becomes more than Ime, Marty, a couple of girls, and a dog on the couch. It's a work night. The girls want to go home. Billy Bob's got a joke. Won't they stay to hear it? 'So Bubba and Marcel decide they're going to go back to school...' He turns to Odessa. 'You know this one right?' </p> <p>'No!' Her voice is rising now, a little irritated. 'I don't know what you're talking about.' </p> <p>Billy Bob looks at her. </p> <p>'I'll call you in the morning,' she says. </p> <p>'Will you call me at 5.30am?' Billy Bob asks gently. 'And again at 6am? I need like nine wake-up calls.' </p> <p>The girls are gone. 'It's a holy day,' Billy Bob says softly. 'Elvis died today.' When Billy Bob was two, his mother took him out to the highway to watch as the King's bus passed by their little town. They stood there by the road, waving. </p> <p>He stretches out on the couch, his physical depletion starting to show. His enthusiasm is faltering. He seems tamed. 'I know I'm compulsive,' he says. 'I'm hungry for the horrible shit, but I can't do that. Not any more. I got something good, and I'm not gonna mess it up.' It's quite late, going on 2am, and he's tired and ruminative all of a sudden. He's thinking about his father. 'Some of the things he loved are things I love, even though he and I didn't know each other or get along. And I have some of his traits.' He says that when his father got upset, he'd go away, disappear. 'That's me, too,' he says. </p> <p>His voice is rasping. Some involuntary twitches. Sometimes he gets so tired that his face starts to twitch. He'll blink his eyes and his whole face seems to blink. He just doesn't have the reserves he had when he was young. </p> <p>'But my father didn't like music,' he says. 'At all. He might be the only man I ever met who didn't like music. There were two songs he liked - \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"Easter Parade\". It seemed incongruous.' He's talking so softly now, almost whispering. 'One's about the magic and wonder of childhood and the hard, cold facts about loss, and the other one is a celebration with hats.' He begins to hum, closing his eyes, and then he sings softly: In your Easter bonnet/With all the frills upon it/You'll be the grandest lady/In the Easter parade. </p> <p>He wants to go downstairs. He wants Ime to hear the new song he wrote, 'Beauty at the Back Door'. They follow the arrow down the stairs into Slash's Snakepit, where Marty and Jim, the engineer, are behind the glass. Ime and Billy Bob sit on the little couch. </p> <p>It's a song about screen doors and myrtle bushes and love, about memory and desire and loss. A little slide guitar, but mostly Billy Bob's voice. It's a spoken-word song, raw, stripped down, a Southern-gothic Leonard Cohen. </p> <p>'My, that's a snappy western shirt you got on,' Billy Bob says to Marty faintly. 'You goin' to a singin'?' </p> <p>'Yeah, I'm going to a singin',' Marty says. </p> <p>And then Billy Bob sings another song, called 'Poison Honey'. </p> <p>His voice is smoky. She draws me in like a moth to a flame/And sometimes at night, I call out her name. </p> <p>'Albums are supposed to reflect what's going on in your life,' Marty says. </p> <p>Billy Bob laughs. 'Then I'm fucked.' </p> <p> There's darkness all around, as the evening shadows fall/Time keeps dragging by, but she ain't coming home at all. </p> <p>Billy Bob listens to the music, his fingers touching his lips. He likes the song, likes where it's going. He crosses his legs, gets comfortable. His eyelids slip down, shut, open, shut. In a few weeks, he'll have run himself down so bad that he'll be in the hospital. But for now, he's got to be up in a few hours, working. His cough will become bronchitis, and an infection will inflame his heart. But in the morning, the extras will be waiting for haircuts. Angie will rush from London to his side. But for now, he folds his hands, nestles them between his knees. The doctor will tell him, 'You know, Billy Bob, you don't have to starve yourself and not sleep.' And Billy Bob, in a burst of light, will promise himself to go on living. But now his shoulders hunch. The music sounds good, like a dream from childhood. His eyes close. </p> <p>Billy Bob Thornton is asleep.</p> <p>\u0095 All the Pretty Horses is released on 9 March, and The Gift will be released on 2 March.</p> <p><strong>Billy Bob Thornton: A life in film</strong></p> <p>As far as most people were concerned, Billy Bob Thornton arrived fully formed as the surprise package of the 1997 Oscars. Having written, directed and starred in Sling Blade, he came across as a backwoods Orson Welles, getting a nomination for Best Actor and an Oscar for Best Screenplay. But his Hollywood CV already included two TV series and 19 movies. Among the pre- Sling Blade efforts was 1993's One False Move, which is still the best film he has been involved with. Written by Thornton and Tom Epperson, it is the strongest of contemporary film noirs. Thornton is terrifying as Ray, a criminal on the run with his accomplices after a cocaine heist. </p> <p>But his real contribution is the script, which alternates between the criminal's tense journey and the difficult relationship between the big-city FBI agents and the small-town sheriff waiting for them. It established what remains a theme in much of Thornton's work: don't underestimate country folk, no matter how dumb or weird they might seem. </p> <p> Sling Blade, as well as proving that Thornton could direct, established his other trademark: a willingness to look odder or uglier than any actor around. Thornton, with an awkwardly cropped head, stars as Karl, the hulking, low-IQ but sweet-natured man who has spent almost all his life in prison for murder. The critic Roger Ebert described the film as ' Forrest Gump written by William Faulkner'. It's a great performance in a very good film. Other Thornton looks have included bizarre thick glasses and a hairy beer belly when he played the grotesque mechanic in Oliver Stone's U-Turn, and more heavy glasses and lank hair in A Simple Plan, where again his character appears to verge on the mentally handicapped, but turns out to be more perceptive than his college-educated brother. </p> <p>A couple of Thornton's finest performances have been in less-than-great films. In Primary Colors he is perfectly cast as a character based on Bill Clinton's aggressively Southern spin doctor James Carville. And he steals the show in Pushing Tin as an eccentric air-traffic controller, who enjoys lying on runways as planes are landing. His slutty wife in the film, incidentally, is played by Angelina Jolie. </p> <p>Once in a while, he shows he can play the straight man in the suit, like his Nasa chief in Armageddon. There's more folk wisdom at the expense of the seemingly sophisticated in The Gift, a swampy supernatural thriller which Thornton wrote but doesn't appear in. Cate Blanchett plays a single mother using her psychic abilities to eke out a living: Thornton claims that his mother had the gift. </p> <p>But acting, writing and directing isn't the whole package: there is music, too. Before he was an actor, Thornton sang and played the drums in the band Tres Hombres (think early ZZ Top), which released one album in 1983. He still writes songs and occasionally performs. We can judge those musical abilities when we see him play a country singer in the forthcoming Wakin' Up in Reno.</p> <p>\u0095 Mark Morris</p>",

      "bodyText": "Billy Bob Thornton is waking up. He's been working a lot, making a lot of movies, so he's tired. He's been making a record, too, after hours. The voice of Johnny Cash, in duet with Billy Bob's own voice, streams from the speakers. They sound pretty good together. Marty Stuart, the producer, is up from Nashville, and he's burning CDs tonight here at the studio, and it's late, after 2am, all the girls have gone home, and Marty's switched from champagne to Mountain Dew. This is the first time he's heard the full mix. 'This record is tryin' to be something.' He says to Jim, the engineer. 'It's comin', it's comin', it's comin'. I see its little head.' Billy Bob's been asleep on the couch, which is funny, because normally he needs to be told to go to sleep, and Marty says this is the most rest he's gotten since 1979. 'I've wore his ass out,' Marty says, even though he's known Billy Bob only a couple years. As Billy Bob's mother says, her boy's been 'keeping the roads hot'. It's a composed sleep, no more than a half-hour or so - his face has not gone slack - and it seems as if he's beginning to stir. His hands are still folded between his knees, his head bowed, chin to his chest. His cap, which reads Henry Swing Club, is pulled low. His skin is amber, the colour of whiskey. A short-sleeved bowling shirt covers most of his tattoos, but one peeks out from under his left sleeve. He wears a black leather band on one wrist and black jeans and black tasselled motorcycle boots, which are starting to show signs of life. He is a parched and worn 45, but in sleep he has the aspect of a baby. People want to stay around and make sure nothing bad happens to him. A hand goes up to his face, an index finger softly rubs the bridge of his nose, and then the hand goes slack as he dissolves again into sleep. He is clean-shaven. He looks like a farmer, not a movie star. This is Billy Bob's couch, in the recording studio that also belongs to him, in the basement of his new house in Beverly Hills. He's owned the place since June, just after he got married to Angelina Jolie - he calls her Angie - and they paid more than $3m for it. The house is 11,000sqft, and it has this recording studio in the basement, which is a big reason Billy Bob wanted it. Slash, the former guitarist for Guns N' Roses, lived here before. Billy Bob's a Hollywood guy, yes, but his music is important to him, and this is not going to be one of those actor-wants-to-be-a-rock-star records, so he doesn't talk about it much. But the studio is a comfortable room, and he likes it. He hasn't really unpacked yet. Boxes are stacked against one wall alongside a framed Pink Floyd poster. There are a couple of oriental rugs, an acoustic guitar, a box labelled Billy Bob's Drum Kit. Billy Bob lifts his head and squints for a second, and then suddenly he is all awake, as if he had never been asleep. He hears Johnny Cash. 'I think his voice is a little hot,' he says softly. Marty's sitting at the soundboard. He adjusts a few knobs. Billy Bob wonders if they should get Cash to record his vocals again. Marty says, 'It's easier to sing to Mount Rushmore than to have Mount Rushmore sing to you.' Then Marty says, 'Time to go, cuz. OK, enough work for tonight. Time to go to bed.' Billy Bob gets to his feet and heads upstairs. He scrapes his heels when he walks, as if the boots are weighing him down. On the landing, he passes a huge arrow pointing back down to the studio. There's a sign on it that reads The Snakepit. Upstairs, the house is a construction zone. Only one room is finished. Newspapers mask the floors. Buckets of paint are stacked along the walls in the foyer. Angie's in London, working, so he's in charge of the renovation. The bedrooms on the second floor all have sliding glass doors that overlook a small outdoor pool. Billy Bob likes the fact that it has the feel of a motel and wants to preserve that. 'I'll never live a normal life,' he says. 'But I try to keep bits of it in my life. Just the idea of having a house, of buying one, knowing there's someplace to call home.' He walks over, flips off the big TV, which has been playing on mute all night, and then goes to the front door. 'Come on, we're goin',' he says. He steps out, lights a cigarette, and locks the door. He won't be sleeping here. 'Nooo sir,' he says, heading for his truck. 'Not until a guy comes and checks the place out for snake eggs.' The house may have a snake problem. Slash liked snakes and kept them in cages and boxes and pens all over the house. Billy Bob can't abide snakes. He hasn't yet spent the night in the house, and he won't until the snake-egg guy comes. He doesn't live in places easily. He once lived in New York City for 10 hours before driving back to Arkansas, defeated and afraid. Tonight he's going to sleep at the Sunset Marquis, the hotel where he's lived off and on for years. When he gets to the hotel, he'll call his bride, who'll just be starting her day. Well, maybe he'll call her. He's not sure. 'It's one of the things I like about this marriage,' he says. 'I was always afraid in relationships before, but I'm not afraid of her. Well, I am afraid of her, I told her that once. First I told her I wasn't afraid of her, and then 20 minutes later I told her the opposite, that I was afraid of her.' So maybe he'll call. This is an early evening for him. He's got to get up at six to cut hair because he's in a movie. He's playing a barber. It's a great night out, warm, swimming weather, but all the Beverly Hills mansions on Billy Bob's street, all built during the same few years - late 20s, early 30s - for the first generation of Hollywood royalty, are dark now. Who could be in bed on a night like this? It's going on 3am, and so Billy Bob's boots and his voice echo a little as he shuffles towards his truck. He's looking at the dark houses. 'I hate people who go to sleep early,' he says. 11pm, second night Billy Bob will never live a normal life. So he went to work today, made some film, negotiated some deal. All real work in the adult world. A bunch of extras lined up at sunrise for haircuts. 'Most nervous extras you ever saw,' Billy Bob says. He gave a couple of flat-tops with antique clippers. It's a Coen brothers film, known currently as The Untitled Barber Project. He is, by all accounts, a delight to be around with on the set, any set. He is kind, funny and inspiring to other actors, and reverential about the work, having had a strange sense of hillbilly destiny about it ever since his mother told him not to worry, he's made it, one day he would work with Burt Reynolds. (He has.) He's got six movies coming out in the next year, four of which he's acting in and two of which he directed, including All the Pretty Horses, the $45m-adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, and The Gift, which he wrote about his mother - both films are due out in the UK next month. He's never been busier and never been more tired; he's got a cough and there's so much day-time work, too, so many decisions to make, so many people to take care of, so much writing to get done, so many stories to get out of himself before it's too late. 'I've got so much shit backed up that it almost gives me an aneurysm,' he says. 'I've got at least another 20 movies in me.' But after dark, Billy Bob's mind seems so starved that he won't sleep voluntarily or easily; he never has since he was a kid, and at these times he has been known even to seek out the interesting company of those he doesn't know very well, and he is disappointed when they don't have the stamina for his hours. 'Oh, no, come on, you can't leave!' he'll say. The bar at his hotel is called the Whiskey, and the candlelit patio out front, with its low wrought-iron tables, is Billy Bob's nocturnal office. There's always somebody or somebody's entourage here. Blonde, lithe young things everywhere. And lots of musicians; there's a recording studio in the basement here, too. And everybody touches everybody else. Little touches, lots of hands, which is fine with Billy Bob because he's from the South, and there they drape themselves all over you. Billy Bob keeps pretty regular hours here, and the Reverend Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top drops by sometimes. He's here tonight, and this is cool because it was not very long ago at all that Billy Bob was the completely unfamous drummer of a ZZ tribute band, Tres Hombres, which Gibbons now graciously calls 'the best little cover band in Texas'. And earlier, Billy Bob jammed in an upstairs room with Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes. And now the Irish director Jim Sheridan pulls up a chair, and Billy Bob talks to him about boxing movies because that's something that Sheridan knows about, and Billy Bob's thinking about directing a boxing movie for Miramax, even though he's said no to all studio films, forever ('Well, at least with Miramax you know whose ass you're kissing'), and lord knows how he'll find the time and preserve his health, but he's already seeing scenes in his head, so he figures it's the right thing to do. Life at the Sunset Marquis has other rewards. There's a gym that Billy Bob uses when he finds himself in bouts of self-improvement. He sometimes works out in his cowboy-and-Indian pjs, and he'll wear Angie's pink underwear. 'Once I was lifting weights, and I thought they were hidden, but some guy kept looking at me strange,' he says. 'Finally, I said, \"They're my wife's.\" I don't think it's strange at all. I wear them to the set some days. I like having her close to me, you know?' Another good thing about the hotel is that everybody knows him here, and the bartenders at the Whiskey are as much as he'll indulge himself in psychotherapy any more. Along the way, he's entered therapy a few times and even tried it with a couple of his ex-wives when things started souring. But he doesn't trust it. 'People in LA think you learn by therapy. But you learn by living. I mean, if you've got to get over having your puppy run over when you were nine, fine, but you've got to keep living. 'See, I've fucked a lot of things up. I've been wrong. In relationships, I've been, like, not present. Or doing some wrong things. People talk about working on things. I don't like to work on things. I never like working on things. When I write, I don't work on it. I start, and I finish. If it don't come out in one long stream of consciousness, it ain't for me. I don't want to construct when I love, when I write. I don't want to go to couples therapy to solve a relationship. I don't want to work on it. I don't believe in it, never have.' Billy Bob had been with the actress Laura Dern for three years when she went off to make a movie. When she got back, Billy Bob was married to Angie. He knows that lots of people out here are sympathetic to Dern's side of things. 'Others may say that you left our girl and married someone else,' he says. 'But it made me happy and somebody else happy. I'm sorry it caused pain.' As the evening unwinds and the foot traffic slows down, Billy Bob chain-smokes and drinks bottles of water and hangs out, talking about All the Pretty Horses and his idea of the movies. He finished the film some time ago but continues to edit, tweak and fight battles over every little thing. He went to test screenings. He knows the audience out there is finicky. 'You've got people who only want to see someone screw an apple pie. But some people are sick and tired of it. They want raw stuff again. We did the movie the way they used to do it.' All the Pretty Horses is a modern epic, with 'interiors out of Sling Blade ' and 'outdoors that look like John Ford', with a big budget and big stars, directed by a guy who's never been trusted with more than a few million dollars before. 'I think the natural tendency these days is to use one of the big guys to direct. I'm not one of them.' Out of nowhere, someone asks, 'When are you going to London?' Billy Bob's fear of flying is famous. Before he gets on a plane, he'll call his mother, who is psychic, to ask her if it's safe. He'll go over there on one condition, he says - if Angie'll take him on the Jack the Ripper tour. It's quiet for a minute, and then Billy Bob speaks. 'You know she won't do anything to hurt me, because she knows it'll hurt her more,' he says. Billy Bob orders more cigarettes and gets up to pee. As he's walking back, he's already talking. He seems excited, maybe exercised. 'Did you ever look at a woman when she's asleep, and you think, who the fuck is that ?' he says, and sits down. 'And, like, the moonlight's coming in when you're sleeping next to her at night and you can kind of see her face - and she looks like a fucking monster ? This might be somebody you have been with for years. And you look at her, and it's like, who in God's name is that? Why - she's a stranger. What is she doing here? I don't even know her. And much of the daytime, you're like, \"Oh, honey, I love you. Are you OK? How was that today?\" But when she's asleep, that's how you really feel about her.' 8pm, same night Billy Bob bleeds [St Louise] Cardinal red, but the Dodgers will do for tonight. He got good tickets and decided to catch a game. Back in Malvern, Arkansas, Billy Bob was a hometown baseball hero, the promising kid who got a major league try-out at 18, got nailed by a bad throw, and broke his collarbone. 'There's nothing in the movies or entertainment that feels like the third pitch that strikes a guy out,' he says. Billy Bob remembers that his father hung a tyre up in the yard so that he could practise his pitching. 'It's the one place my dad and I connected every now and then,' he says. He looks around Dodger Stadium, shrugs his shoulders, and squints. 'Or maybe that's my fantasy.' Billy Bob was not close to his father. Billy Ray Thornton was gone a lot, teaching and coaching mostly basketball at small high schools out of town. Billy Bob says that every film he does is reckoning with his father. 'In my movies, there's either shitty fathers, absent fathers, fathers that you want their approval. Or the father's just not there. He died or whatever.' After the game, Billy Bob's in the car talking on the phone to his most recent ex-wife, Pietra, with whom he has two young sons. 'Don't make any plans for Friday night. We can make a dessert like strawberry shortcake or something like that.' He's sweet and kind to her now. It's late, but his kids aren't asleep. One of his boys announces over the phone that he's trying to kill a spider. 'Your mom ripped his body off? Wait, what - the spider's on his back, shivering with a chicken bone in his mouth? Well, that's a huge spider. Oh, that's the dog. OK, honey, did your mom tell you that I'm coming Friday night and we're gonna cook? We're gonna make something, just you and your brother and me and your mom. You sure are, baby, you are the luckiest boy. I love you. Goodnight, baby.' 1am, first night The house is rockin', sort of. In the one finished room, Billy Bob's trying to convince Odessa, his young assistant, that he always wanted to 'fuck a midget'. 'I always wanted to fuck a midget,' he tells her in earnest. 'I just wanted to see what it was like. I don't any more. But didn't you ever want to?' 'No!' Odessa yelps in a slurry North Carolina accent. She's 25, pretty, and has worked with Billy Bob for a couple of years. 'I always wanted to just pick them up by the ankles,' Billy Bob goes on. 'Think of all the things you could do with 'em. You can pick 'em up, turn 'em upside down by their ankles.' He holds up an imaginary midget, shakes it a little. Then he's slow dancing, loving the midget up and down. Odessa backs off a bit. Kristin, another assistant, is on the couch with Odessa's pit bull, Percy, giggling. 'I've seen midgets fucking,' Billy Bob says. 'You've seen it?' Odessa asks. 'Of course!' he says 'What do you mean, of course ? Like everybody has?' 'Not like everybody else has,' he says. 'Like I have.' 'I don't ever want to see that,' Odessa says. 'It's just wrong.' Marty Stuart comes whistling up from the studio. 'More bubbly?' Billy Bob asks, cackling. He's broken out champagne, ecstatic that he wrote a new song tonight. And that's as good a reason as any to make this night the first party in the new house. 'Slash had a room full of iguanas over there.' Billy Bob points past the bar. 'Man, I can't stand a lizard. I don't like that skin, I don't like the way they look.' Percy the pit bull ambles over and rubs against Billy Bob's leg. The dog's got a long, mean scar on his back. Odessa rescued him from somewhere up in the Hollywood Hills. It's one of the things Billy likes about Odessa, that her heart's so big. Another thing is that she genuinely doesn't seem to know or care who's famous and who's not, except for the day she saw Rhea Perlman [Carla from Cheers ] on the street and just about lost it. 'Marty and I were talking today,' Billy Bob says, 'about how in the South it's all right to beat a dog.' He and Marty are trying to work each other up. 'It's a kind of a way of life,' Marty says. Both men are laughing, their shoulders shaking. 'There's a place in Nashville,' Marty says. 'where you could get braces for your dog's teeth. The dog dentist. If your dog had buckteeth, you could get him braces.' 'Oh, well, that's just ridiculous,' Odessa says. 'Not if you're a buck-toothed dog!' Billy Bob says. Ime Etuk walks in, a soft-spoken black man in his twenties. Ime's an assistant director around town and Billy Bob's bowling buddy. 'You got a marijuana cigarette?' Billy Bob asks Ime. 'Not on me,' Ime says. Billy Bob is happy and loose, and he wants to have fun. He wants to have fun like Sinatra did, all night and whatever the hell he wanted. He can't wait for the house to be up and running so that he can get a little of that Southern Rat Pack feeling. A pool table, table football, and a Velcro room of his own design. 'Where are all my bitches?' Billy Bob cries out. 'I know I have more bitches than this! Odessa, call people! Tell 'em to come over!' 'We tried to call everybody,' Kristin says. 'We told them it was a pyjama party.' 'What's wrong with the world?' Billy Bob says. 'Everybody's tired,' Kristin says. 'Well I'm tired, too .' Alex, Billy Bob's chef, shows up, along with a blonde actress and a producer and a guy in a suit. Alex says that during the filming of All the Pretty Horses, she had to call Arkansas to 'find out from his momma how to make chocolate gravy and biscuits'. Billy Bob veers into a story about the night he saw a man barking his ass off in a grocery store. This was in Santa Fe late at night, after a day of shooting All the Pretty Horses , when Billy Bob and a couple of the girls were looking for a midnight snack. 'We've always been addicted to various kinds of cereal,' Billy Bob says. 'Cap'n Crunch!' Odessa says. 'Golden Grahams!' Kristin says. 'There was a guy there barking his ass off, just throwing his head back, doing the whole thing. I love that shit. I love that shit!' The party never becomes more than Ime, Marty, a couple of girls, and a dog on the couch. It's a work night. The girls want to go home. Billy Bob's got a joke. Won't they stay to hear it? 'So Bubba and Marcel decide they're going to go back to school...' He turns to Odessa. 'You know this one right?' 'No!' Her voice is rising now, a little irritated. 'I don't know what you're talking about.' Billy Bob looks at her. 'I'll call you in the morning,' she says. 'Will you call me at 5.30am?' Billy Bob asks gently. 'And again at 6am? I need like nine wake-up calls.' The girls are gone. 'It's a holy day,' Billy Bob says softly. 'Elvis died today.' When Billy Bob was two, his mother took him out to the highway to watch as the King's bus passed by their little town. They stood there by the road, waving. He stretches out on the couch, his physical depletion starting to show. His enthusiasm is faltering. He seems tamed. 'I know I'm compulsive,' he says. 'I'm hungry for the horrible shit, but I can't do that. Not any more. I got something good, and I'm not gonna mess it up.' It's quite late, going on 2am, and he's tired and ruminative all of a sudden. He's thinking about his father. 'Some of the things he loved are things I love, even though he and I didn't know each other or get along. And I have some of his traits.' He says that when his father got upset, he'd go away, disappear. 'That's me, too,' he says. His voice is rasping. Some involuntary twitches. Sometimes he gets so tired that his face starts to twitch. He'll blink his eyes and his whole face seems to blink. He just doesn't have the reserves he had when he was young. 'But my father didn't like music,' he says. 'At all. He might be the only man I ever met who didn't like music. There were two songs he liked - \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"Easter Parade\". It seemed incongruous.' He's talking so softly now, almost whispering. 'One's about the magic and wonder of childhood and the hard, cold facts about loss, and the other one is a celebration with hats.' He begins to hum, closing his eyes, and then he sings softly: In your Easter bonnet/With all the frills upon it/You'll be the grandest lady/In the Easter parade. He wants to go downstairs. He wants Ime to hear the new song he wrote, 'Beauty at the Back Door'. They follow the arrow down the stairs into Slash's Snakepit, where Marty and Jim, the engineer, are behind the glass. Ime and Billy Bob sit on the little couch. It's a song about screen doors and myrtle bushes and love, about memory and desire and loss. A little slide guitar, but mostly Billy Bob's voice. It's a spoken-word song, raw, stripped down, a Southern-gothic Leonard Cohen. 'My, that's a snappy western shirt you got on,' Billy Bob says to Marty faintly. 'You goin' to a singin'?' 'Yeah, I'm going to a singin',' Marty says. And then Billy Bob sings another song, called 'Poison Honey'. His voice is smoky. She draws me in like a moth to a flame/And sometimes at night, I call out her name. 'Albums are supposed to reflect what's going on in your life,' Marty says. Billy Bob laughs. 'Then I'm fucked.' There's darkness all around, as the evening shadows fall/Time keeps dragging by, but she ain't coming home at all. Billy Bob listens to the music, his fingers touching his lips. He likes the song, likes where it's going. He crosses his legs, gets comfortable. His eyelids slip down, shut, open, shut. In a few weeks, he'll have run himself down so bad that he'll be in the hospital. But for now, he's got to be up in a few hours, working. His cough will become bronchitis, and an infection will inflame his heart. But in the morning, the extras will be waiting for haircuts. Angie will rush from London to his side. But for now, he folds his hands, nestles them between his knees. The doctor will tell him, 'You know, Billy Bob, you don't have to starve yourself and not sleep.' And Billy Bob, in a burst of light, will promise himself to go on living. But now his shoulders hunch. The music sounds good, like a dream from childhood. His eyes close. Billy Bob Thornton is asleep. \u0095 All the Pretty Horses is released on 9 March, and The Gift will be released on 2 March. Billy Bob Thornton: A life in film As far as most people were concerned, Billy Bob Thornton arrived fully formed as the surprise package of the 1997 Oscars. Having written, directed and starred in Sling Blade, he came across as a backwoods Orson Welles, getting a nomination for Best Actor and an Oscar for Best Screenplay. But his Hollywood CV already included two TV series and 19 movies. Among the pre- Sling Blade efforts was 1993's One False Move, which is still the best film he has been involved with. Written by Thornton and Tom Epperson, it is the strongest of contemporary film noirs. Thornton is terrifying as Ray, a criminal on the run with his accomplices after a cocaine heist. But his real contribution is the script, which alternates between the criminal's tense journey and the difficult relationship between the big-city FBI agents and the small-town sheriff waiting for them. It established what remains a theme in much of Thornton's work: don't underestimate country folk, no matter how dumb or weird they might seem. Sling Blade, as well as proving that Thornton could direct, established his other trademark: a willingness to look odder or uglier than any actor around. Thornton, with an awkwardly cropped head, stars as Karl, the hulking, low-IQ but sweet-natured man who has spent almost all his life in prison for murder. The critic Roger Ebert described the film as ' Forrest Gump written by William Faulkner'. It's a great performance in a very good film. Other Thornton looks have included bizarre thick glasses and a hairy beer belly when he played the grotesque mechanic in Oliver Stone's U-Turn, and more heavy glasses and lank hair in A Simple Plan, where again his character appears to verge on the mentally handicapped, but turns out to be more perceptive than his college-educated brother. A couple of Thornton's finest performances have been in less-than-great films. In Primary Colors he is perfectly cast as a character based on Bill Clinton's aggressively Southern spin doctor James Carville. And he steals the show in Pushing Tin as an eccentric air-traffic controller, who enjoys lying on runways as planes are landing. His slutty wife in the film, incidentally, is played by Angelina Jolie. Once in a while, he shows he can play the straight man in the suit, like his Nasa chief in Armageddon. There's more folk wisdom at the expense of the seemingly sophisticated in The Gift, a swampy supernatural thriller which Thornton wrote but doesn't appear in. Cate Blanchett plays a single mother using her psychic abilities to eke out a living: Thornton claims that his mother had the gift. But acting, writing and directing isn't the whole package: there is music, too. Before he was an actor, Thornton sang and played the drums in the band Tres Hombres (think early ZZ Top), which released one album in 1983. He still writes songs and occasionally performs. We can judge those musical abilities when we see him play a country singer in the forthcoming Wakin' Up in Reno. \u0095 Mark Morris",

      "byline": "Tim Adams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Christine Keeler sits rolling the slimmest of cigarettes under a framed line-drawing on the wall behind her of a hangdog Harold Macmillan. We are in the boardroom of her publishers, a company once chaired by the man whose government she did much to bring down, and she is reminded of the day that Macmillan invited her round for tea. 'Towards the end of his life he told his daughter that his worst mistake in the whole business was calling me a tart,' she says in her broken smoker's voice. 'And that's what he seriously seemed to have believed; that was the worst thing he had done to me. So his daughter, Sarah, invited me over, I suppose so he could apologise for that.' She looks down at her cigarette. 'But in the end, I didn't go, wouldn't really have known where to start...' </p> <p>Listening to Keeler unravel the stubbornly tangled story of her life, you have the sense that starting would not really have been the problem, but knowing where to stop might have presented a difficulty. Much of what she would have liked to tell the former Prime Minister is contained in her new, ghosted autobiography, The Truth at Last, and there is a compulsive, ancient mariner quality to its narrative. The book contains fresh allegations and revelations, most notably that she became pregnant by John Profumo, that Stephen Ward was a leading Soviet agent and that Sir Roger Hollis, then head of MI5, was working alongside him. </p> <p>It also reruns the familiar saga of lust, disgrace and cover-up, one that seems to have become more tragic with the passing of time. Over the years, she suggests, and ever since she was 'betrayed' by Lord Denning in his official enquiry, no one has really wanted to hear her version of events, however hard she has tried to convey it. 'They wanted to hear about the sex, of course,' she says. 'But not the rest; no one wanted to hear the rest.' </p> <p>At 59, occasional traces of Keeler's former incendiary beauty still inhabit her features as her face shifts in and out of expressive recollections. When she talks about her younger self - the girl staring into the camera on that chair - it is in the third person, as a creation she does not recognise, and her eyes give away some of the anger she feels at her life having been stolen from her. </p> <p>'I mean, it's been a misery for me, living with Christine Keeler,' she says at one point. 'Even a criminal has the right to a new life, but they made sure I did not have that. They just didn't stop calling me a prostitute for ever and ever and ever and ever. How can anyone live with that? I took on the sins of everybody, of a generation, really...' She says this without self-pity, but without much hope either. </p> <p>She has written her book now, she says, 'for history', though there is a financial motive, too. Having got it out in the open she's relieved, happy even. That Keeler has lived each day with her fate, since the very first headline, is apparent in her every word and gesture. She habitually refers to the very public dramas of her life in a sort of personal shorthand; out of the blue, she will murmur: 'Bill Astor knew these papers were missing... Stephen showed his hand in October', as if trying to get these shifting details sorted in her head for the millionth time. </p> <p>Some of this uncertainty is because hers is a story that she has learned more about as time has passed and new documents have become available, notably the 1,000-page CIA file on the case. The result is, in her mind at least, the conspiracy theory to incorporate all conspiracy theories, a seductive plot which takes in the Bay of Pigs, Anthony Blunt, Lord Astor and the Krays. It may 'out-Bond Bond' but it is also the saddest story she has ever heard. </p> <p>'One way of reading my life,' Keeler says, beginning at the beginning, 'is that I have been in constant search for a father.' She was born in 1942, a war baby, and her real father was away in the Army. In his absence, her mother took up with a man who, she says in passing, had one leg shorter than the other and whom she was told to call Dad. Like characters in an all-too-real fairy story, the three of them lived in a poorly converted railway carriage on the edge of a gravel pit in rural Berkshire. </p> <p>Looking back on her childhood seems particularly painful for Keeler even now, despite all that followed. 'As a little girl I used to daydream about my real father coming on a white horse,' she says, more bitter than wistful. 'Coming to rescue me.' These dreams became more desperate from the age of 11 or 12 when she was abused while babysitting for some children who lived nearby. 'The fathers, if they got me alone, would try to kiss and fondle me. I hated it.' </p> <p>At about the time she developed an intense fear of her own stepfather. 'I went out every single night so I was never alone with him,' she recalls. 'At 12, I stopped going on holiday with them. The times I was alone with him I always made sure I was all covered up.' Just thinking of this, nearly half-a-century later, she tugs the sleeves down on her sweater, hugs herself a little, shivers. 'Nothing ever happened, but I slept with a knife under my pillow and never spoke to him, from the age of about 13 until I left home four years later.' </p> <p>She got used to infamy early in life. There was, she says, the village disgrace that went with her parents not being married and the fact that her mother also 'used to go out on her own, and I used to have to keep a look out for my stepfather coming home'. Her mortal fear, she recalls, was that her stepfather would 'split up with her mother, and come after me'. With this constantly in mind, she invested all of her energies in keeping her parents as happy together as possible. It was a habit she continued later in life. 'All my money went on her for years and years,' she says of her mother. 'From the very beginning, when I was seeing Peter Rachman, or working [as a show girl] at the Cabaret Club, it was so I could send them money, because if I sent her money, he would be nice to her for a while. And that's the way it went on, until I couldn't do it any more and then obviously he left.' </p> <p>When she was 16, Keeler became pregnant by a boy she met locally. She tried to conceal the fact from her parents, tried to abort her baby with a pen, with castor oil, gin and hot baths. The pregnancy continued, however, and when her secret was out her stepfather confined her to her room for months. In the end, she went through labour prematurely in her own bed and despite the pain of her contractions says she 'did not make a sound, because I could not bear the thought of him hearing'. The baby, a boy she named Peter before he was taken from her, died later in hospital. </p> <p>I wonder what kind of psychological effect she thought having that child alone in her bedroom might have had? </p> <p>'Well, for one thing,' she says, suddenly colder, or remembering only one extreme hurt in a lifetime of hurts, 'it ruined my bust, because they came and bound me up and I had awful stretch marks. I hated my breasts after that. And for another, I left home. I had to go.' </p> <p>In London, Keeler's daddy-shaped vacuum was filled by Stephen Ward. History has painted the curious osteopath, with an appointments book that included Prince Philip, Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor, as a political dilettante and social Mr Fixit; has seen his suicide, on the eve of his trumped-up conviction for living off immoral earnings, to be the final act in one of the most shaming episodes of British judicial history. In her book, Keeler presents a different picture of the man, if not of his fate. She suggests that Ward was, in fact, an important figure for Soviet intelligence: 'I don't know if he was the fourth man or the fifth... but he was certainly in the top 10...' and sketches him as a ruthless Cold Warrior, who conducted regular meetings with the likes of Anthony Blunt from his consulting rooms, who treated as a hired hand her one-time lover Eugene Ivanov, the Russian naval attach\u00e9 and spy, and who conspired, successfully as it turned out, to destabilise the Western alliance. </p> <p>Deconstructing the nature of Ward's influence over her, she suggests that he saw in her 'an ability to keep her mouth shut' and a crippling insecurity on which he could work. It was, she claims, after she had witnessed meetings between Ward and Sir Roger Hollis, head of MI5, and delivered, on his behalf, documents to the Russian Embassy, that Ward wanted to destroy her, thinking she knew too much. (In fact, she only discovered who Hollis was, she suggests, when Lord Denning showed her a picture of him during their interview for the inquiry; the spymaster, also named by Peter Wright as working for the Russians, was subsequently investigated four times as a double agent and exonerated on each occasion.) </p> <p>Whatever the truth of Keeler's allegations, Ward certainly worked in mysterious ways. She cites a near fatal boating accident, when she believed Ward tried to drown her. 'I knew he wanted to, but I could see in his eyes that he could not do it. But I knew at that point that he was going to have it done.' With this in mind, she implies compelling motives for his subsequent bizarre patterns of behaviour: proposals of marriage (prompted she believes by the law which states that a wife cannot turn evidence against her husband); his attempts to discredit her with the authorities (Ward informed the police that she had had a drug habit after he had instructed her to buy some dope which they smoked together); and his efforts to introduce her to more and more desperate figures, concluding with the West Indian caf\u00e9 owner Lucky Gordon, who imprisoned and raped Keeler on two occasions, each time, she says, after Ward let him know where she lived. </p> <p>Looking back now, and despite all of this, she seems unwilling to find anger or hatred for Ward, however. From the outset, she says, she 'trusted in him, believed in him, of course like a father' and the root of that trust lay in the fact that he was the first man she had ever met in her adult life, despite his well-documented sexual appetites, who 'did not try to grab hold of me. I mean, men, all men, were always trying to get hold of me, you know...' He used to say that other men were 'all bastards, following their pricks', but he let her know he was different. 'I absolutely respected him, for that,' she says now. 'He loved life. Everything he did he made to seem a wonderful thing to do.' </p> <p>But didn't he also procure lovers for her? Wasn't it Ward who suggested she went with Profumo and Ivanov? Who introduced her to Peter Rachman, the property racketeer, who kept her for a time in a flat, had sex with her every afternoon, never once looking her in the eye? </p> <p>She says it was, but mostly, she argues, 'we lived a very quiet life.We'd never go out. We once went to that sex orgy, and I didn't like it, and that was that. And there were maybe one or two cocktail parties'. She struggles for the names of their party hosts. 'A Guinness, maybe, a McAlpine.' </p> <p>Keeler is generally calm, philosophical, as she relates this history, but she flares up at anything I say that carries even the vaguest implication that she was a call girl. This false characterisation of her, one which has stuck so firmly, was, she believes, the deliberate invention of Lord Denning who seemed determined, at a time when spies were embarrassing Britain in the eyes of its American allies, to present the Profumo case as a sexual scandal rather than as another espionage story. She claims she told Denning most of what appears in her book, and cites in her argument the fact that Denning wanted to destroy all the interviews that led to his report, and eventually managed to get them officially sealed until 2045. </p> <p>'We knew we were talking about spies,' she says. 'And I knew he knew I knew. But, of course, I was digging my own grave. Denning decided that I would be the lying prostitute. And he knew full well that the only lying prostitute there was Mandy Rice-Davies...' </p> <p>To clarify the point, Keeler casts around for a modern equivalent of the girl she really had been, back then. 'I was,' she says, 'probably someone not unlike an It Girl, in my day. I mean, I was out to have a good time. I was very young, 18, 19, and I wanted to work. I always wanted to work, to be a model, or an actress or whatever.' </p> <p>I wonder why she did not try to go public with her stories about Ward and Hollis at the time or subsequently (Hollis died in 1972) and she says that mostly it was through fear. She believed, still believes to an extent, that the security services wanted her dead. She points to a CIA memo which could be seen to imply that both she and Mariella Novotny, friend of Stephen Ward, former lover of both John and Robert Kennedy and hostess of sado-masochistic parties for British establishment figures, were on an unofficial agency hit list. More improbably, she refers to a documentary made at around the time of the 1989 film Scandal in which Lucky Gordon was interviewed, and again informed of where she was living ('not which tower block, exactly, but on which floor, the eleventh') as evidence that people were still trying to have her killed. Fantasy or not, she was so frightened on seeing it that she and her son moved out of their home overnight. </p> <p>Keeler's version of the events of her own life is, as she tells it, both temptingly plausible and impossible to verify. She views alternative narratives, such as Michael Caton-Jones's film Scandal and the book, Honeytrap, on which it was based, as the Denning Report in a different guise: if not part of a deliberate cover-up then further evidence of the casual misogyny and sexism that has hidden the truth and destroyed her life. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Stephen Dorrill, co-author of the book and film, and an authority on the British Secret Service, dismisses Keeler's claims about both as 'all untrue and total rubbish'. When I asked him on the phone which parts of her story he did not believe, he simply said 'all of it', suggesting that Keeler's knowledge of the security services was such that in the past she was in the habit of referring to them as the 'social security'. </p> <p>To back up this condemnation, Dorrill cited the testimony of figures such as Robert Harbinson, a friend both of Ward and Blunt, who attested that the pair never had any dealings with each other. And he pointed out that there is no evidence at all to link Ward with Hollis (other, that is, than Keeler's eyewitness accounts). </p> <p>Dorrill seemed happy enough, too, to fall in with the kind of character assassination with which Keeler is all too familiar. 'Christine is dishonourable in the way she treats people who cannot defend themselves now they have died,' he said in passing, dismissing out of hand her claims to have become pregnant by John Profumo as 'obvious nonsense'. 'In general,' he suggested, recalling his own efforts to get to the truth of the story, 'we came to the conclusion that Mandy Rice-Davies was pretty accurate about events, but Christine wasn't.' Rice-Davies was happy to co-operate with the film, but Keeler was not. In conclusion, Dorrill suggested that I asked Keeler how many abortions she had had in her life, and that I inquire of her the extent to which she had been involved in pornography. 'Given the amount of drugs she has taken over the years,' he said, 'I can't believe she can reconstruct any of these ancient conversations at all.' </p> <p>Caroline Coon, campaigner on liberal issues and a friend of Keeler's since the Sixties, dismisses any suggestion that Keeler has been drug dependent as 'absolute fucking nonsense' and argues that it is 'hypocritical codswallop of any of the slew of men who have made a fortune out of Christine to question her motives for coming out with her story now'. She suggests that over the years, Keeler has never been offered enough money by anyone to justify telling her story and 'everyone, all those self-righteous men, have always wanted something for nothing from her'. (In Keeler's own account, she was paid \u00a35,000 to attend the premiere of Scandal, a tacit endorsement, and sat through the film with gritted teeth.) </p> <p>'I wish and hope,' Coon says, 'that Christine will never be in a position to want for money again. She, of anyone, deserves to make a fortune out of her story. Remember, in all of this, she was the only one who ever went to prison for what happened.' </p> <p>Coon is working on a large-scale history painting of her friend. It is a portrait, she hopes, which will show both the most beautiful woman she ever met (at 26, Coon says, Keeler had skin 'like that of a pearl, a transfixing beauty') and one which incorporates 'what happens when a young working-class girl gets scapegoated, as Christine was so criminally'. </p> <p>One of the things that moved Keeler to tell her story now was watching the Lewinsky hearings, seeing the ways in which power would always conspire to destroy the character of individuals who threatened it. She has watched, too, over the years, the rehabilitation of John Profumo KBE who, through his penitent charity work, has achieved saint-like status. She smiles a little when she recalls how Margaret Thatcher called Profumo a 'national hero' and mentions, too, that he received an invitation to the Queen Mother's recent birthday celebrations. She, no doubt, wonders how this man, whose initial response to the allegations was to lie to the House of Commons and to ask in private 'who's going to believe a word of this tart?' can rightly reclaim his good name when that opportunity has never been afforded to her. </p> <p>After she came out of prison (she went in for an 18-month perjury sentence relating to a detail in the trial of Johnnie Edgecombe, who fired shots at her), she had various attempts at restarting her life, but Christine Keeler always returned to haunt her. She married twice, the first occasion in the Sixties to a man from her home town, but they split up after she was pursued by a stalker. </p> <p>Her second marriage in the early Seventies, to a self-made businessman, was equally disastrous. Both of her husbands left her with a son. The eldest, Jimmy, was brought up by Keeler's mother, against her wishes, and they are no longer in touch ('She turned him against me from an early age,' she says of her mother, 'but he has the house I gave them. So why should he bother with me?'); the youngest, Seymour, has been her life's saving grace. </p> <p>Since 1978, Keeler has had no men in her life, or at least none she has been prepared to live with. 'I'm terrified of men these days,' she says, a little sadly. 'That's the truth. If someone asked me out now, I don't know what I'd say, how I'd react. But I couldn't go through with it, not at all. I suppose I've been terrified of them all along. But it's only now I realise it...' </p> <p>At least, she says, as a single mother, she has been able to ensure that 'no one was ever, not for one night, going to put my son through anything that I had to suffer, make him be afraid or lie awake. And I never found anyone who was good enough, who I could trust enough, to take on the position of his father.' </p> <p>Financially, they have always struggled. Any money Keeler ever made from her name was given to her mother, she says, or lost to a crooked business manager. She spent many years dealing with the Inland Revenue about questions over earnings she never received. In recent years, she has tried to work in various jobs, under her assumed surname, Sloane. She sold advertising space for a magazine, found a job as a receptionist in a dry cleaners and, most recently in 1995, was a dinner lady at a school in London. When the headmaster discovered who she was, she was dismissed without explanation. 'After that, I didn't have the confidence,' she says. 'I sold up and moved down to the sea, lived on the DSS for a while, but I hated that... never want to go back to that.' And so she decided to tell her story. </p> <p>Looking back, now, I wonder who she really blames for what has happened in her life? </p> <p>'Denning,' she says, without missing a beat. </p> <p>Not Stephen Ward? </p> <p>'Well, Stephen was utterly ruthless, he had to be stopped. But they had to shut me up, too. And that was Denning. He told the lies.' </p> <p>And what of Profumo, her nemesis, what does she remember now of their star-crossed affair? </p> <p>'I won't say I didn't like it at the time, the sex that is, because I wouldn't have let him do it at all, of course not, if that had been the case. He had a way with him. Before you had a chance to say no he was there and done,' she says. 'That only happened to me once before, with a duke, who literally swept me off my feet, and before I knew what was happening, you know we'd done it,' she smiles. 'Another terrible mistake.' </p> <p>In her book, she claims that after Profumo saw her for the last time, she discovered she was pregnant and had a further abortion. Why did she not tell him? </p> <p>'Well,' she says, 'you have to believe that I didn't want to hurt him any more than I had done already...' </p> <p>When she talks about Profumo, it is with an air of weariness, a quiet acknowledgement of the way that name will forever be yoked to hers, and of the lives she might have lived had she never heard it. If her book had been a novel, I suggest, before I leave, she would have to bump into this man one more time. Does she have any idea what she would say? </p> <p>She thinks for a while. 'I don't know,' she says finally. 'I don' t know even if I ruined his life. I certainly changed it.' She looks up. 'He's got a girlfriend, I hear,' she says. 'He's 85 and he's met another woman.' She laughs, a little, at the oddity of the thought. 'Still, at 85, why ever not?' </p> <p><strong>Christine Keeler and the Profumo Scandal</strong></p> <p><strong> 2 February 1942:</strong> Christine Keeler was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex </p> <p><strong>1959</strong>: She meets Stephen Ward, osteopath to the rich and powerful, at Murray's nightclub where she is a showgirl. </p> <p><strong> September 1960</strong>: Mandy Rice Davies starts work at Murray's. </p> <p><strong> February 1961:</strong> Keeler moves into Ward's Wimpole Mews flat where she says she witnessed him meeting Eugene Ivanov, the director general of MI5 Sir Roger Hollis and Anthony Blunt. </p> <p><strong> June 1961:</strong> Keith Wagstaffe, a Hollis underling from MI5, comes to Ward's Wimpole Mews flat. The security services have become suspicious of Ivanov and of Ward's friendship with him. Ward starts to see Keeler as a 'ticking bomb'. </p> <p><strong> 8 July 1961:</strong> Ward introduces Keeler to John Profumo, Secretary of State for War, at Cliveden. Ward's aim was for Christine to find out from Profumo through 'pillow talk... when nuclear warheads were being moved to Germany'. </p> <p><strong> October 1961: Keeler becomes pregnant by Profumo. She has an abortion three months later.</strong> </p> <p><strong> 14 December 1962:</strong> Keeler's ex-boyfriend Johnnie Edgecombe tries to shoot her at the Wimpole Mews flat. The police are called and the attention of the media is drawn to Ward and the people (and agents) who come and go from his flat. </p> <p><strong>22 March 1963:</strong> Profumo makes a personal statement to the House of Commons denying his involvement with Keeler. </p> <p><strong> 5 June 1963:</strong> Jack Profumo resigns. </p> <p><strong> 30 July 1963:</strong> Stephen Ward obtains Nembutal and kills himself. </p> <p><strong>1963:</strong> Keeler is jailed for nine months for perjury. </p> <p> <strong>The Photographer, His Chair, That Image and the Copycats...</strong></p> <p> <strong> Lewis Morley:</strong> Christine came into my studio at the Establishment Club in Soho for a publicity shoot for a movie that never got made. The session was very quick. I took a couple of rolls of her in a little jerkin she was wearing. Then there was a bit of a tiswas because the movie producers wanted her to be photographed nude and she wasn't keen. So I got rid of everybody from the studio. I told her I would turn my back and she took all her clothes off. She later said she kept her knickers on. She didn't, but I won't argue with that. </p> <p>She was quite coy. Not blatant at all. I said to her: 'Sit behind that chair and you'll still be fulfilling the nude bit in your contract.' It was a cheap copy of an Arne Jacobson chair from Heals' sale. I've still got it. I only took one roll of her on the chair. It all took 10 minutes at the most. </p> <p>The whole thing was very relaxed as far as I was concerned. I didn't think about what was happening. It was a job. It just happened to snowball. Its been good and bad in that I've done a lot of work, but on the other hand people only know me through the Keeler photograph. For years I hardly made a penny out of it: maybe \u00a33,000, when it could have been worth a hundred times that. In 1989 I won back the copyright. </p> <p>Matt Groening sent me a drawing of Homer Simpson on the chair.

      "bodyText": "Christine Keeler sits rolling the slimmest of cigarettes under a framed line-drawing on the wall behind her of a hangdog Harold Macmillan. We are in the boardroom of her publishers, a company once chaired by the man whose government she did much to bring down, and she is reminded of the day that Macmillan invited her round for tea. 'Towards the end of his life he told his daughter that his worst mistake in the whole business was calling me a tart,' she says in her broken smoker's voice. 'And that's what he seriously seemed to have believed; that was the worst thing he had done to me. So his daughter, Sarah, invited me over, I suppose so he could apologise for that.' She looks down at her cigarette. 'But in the end, I didn't go, wouldn't really have known where to start...' Listening to Keeler unravel the stubbornly tangled story of her life, you have the sense that starting would not really have been the problem, but knowing where to stop might have presented a difficulty. Much of what she would have liked to tell the former Prime Minister is contained in her new, ghosted autobiography, The Truth at Last, and there is a compulsive, ancient mariner quality to its narrative. The book contains fresh allegations and revelations, most notably that she became pregnant by John Profumo, that Stephen Ward was a leading Soviet agent and that Sir Roger Hollis, then head of MI5, was working alongside him. It also reruns the familiar saga of lust, disgrace and cover-up, one that seems to have become more tragic with the passing of time. Over the years, she suggests, and ever since she was 'betrayed' by Lord Denning in his official enquiry, no one has really wanted to hear her version of events, however hard she has tried to convey it. 'They wanted to hear about the sex, of course,' she says. 'But not the rest; no one wanted to hear the rest.' At 59, occasional traces of Keeler's former incendiary beauty still inhabit her features as her face shifts in and out of expressive recollections. When she talks about her younger self - the girl staring into the camera on that chair - it is in the third person, as a creation she does not recognise, and her eyes give away some of the anger she feels at her life having been stolen from her. 'I mean, it's been a misery for me, living with Christine Keeler,' she says at one point. 'Even a criminal has the right to a new life, but they made sure I did not have that. They just didn't stop calling me a prostitute for ever and ever and ever and ever. How can anyone live with that? I took on the sins of everybody, of a generation, really...' She says this without self-pity, but without much hope either. She has written her book now, she says, 'for history', though there is a financial motive, too. Having got it out in the open she's relieved, happy even. That Keeler has lived each day with her fate, since the very first headline, is apparent in her every word and gesture. She habitually refers to the very public dramas of her life in a sort of personal shorthand; out of the blue, she will murmur: 'Bill Astor knew these papers were missing... Stephen showed his hand in October', as if trying to get these shifting details sorted in her head for the millionth time. Some of this uncertainty is because hers is a story that she has learned more about as time has passed and new documents have become available, notably the 1,000-page CIA file on the case. The result is, in her mind at least, the conspiracy theory to incorporate all conspiracy theories, a seductive plot which takes in the Bay of Pigs, Anthony Blunt, Lord Astor and the Krays. It may 'out-Bond Bond' but it is also the saddest story she has ever heard. 'One way of reading my life,' Keeler says, beginning at the beginning, 'is that I have been in constant search for a father.' She was born in 1942, a war baby, and her real father was away in the Army. In his absence, her mother took up with a man who, she says in passing, had one leg shorter than the other and whom she was told to call Dad. Like characters in an all-too-real fairy story, the three of them lived in a poorly converted railway carriage on the edge of a gravel pit in rural Berkshire. Looking back on her childhood seems particularly painful for Keeler even now, despite all that followed. 'As a little girl I used to daydream about my real father coming on a white horse,' she says, more bitter than wistful. 'Coming to rescue me.' These dreams became more desperate from the age of 11 or 12 when she was abused while babysitting for some children who lived nearby. 'The fathers, if they got me alone, would try to kiss and fondle me. I hated it.' At about the time she developed an intense fear of her own stepfather. 'I went out every single night so I was never alone with him,' she recalls. 'At 12, I stopped going on holiday with them. The times I was alone with him I always made sure I was all covered up.' Just thinking of this, nearly half-a-century later, she tugs the sleeves down on her sweater, hugs herself a little, shivers. 'Nothing ever happened, but I slept with a knife under my pillow and never spoke to him, from the age of about 13 until I left home four years later.' She got used to infamy early in life. There was, she says, the village disgrace that went with her parents not being married and the fact that her mother also 'used to go out on her own, and I used to have to keep a look out for my stepfather coming home'. Her mortal fear, she recalls, was that her stepfather would 'split up with her mother, and come after me'. With this constantly in mind, she invested all of her energies in keeping her parents as happy together as possible. It was a habit she continued later in life. 'All my money went on her for years and years,' she says of her mother. 'From the very beginning, when I was seeing Peter Rachman, or working [as a show girl] at the Cabaret Club, it was so I could send them money, because if I sent her money, he would be nice to her for a while. And that's the way it went on, until I couldn't do it any more and then obviously he left.' When she was 16, Keeler became pregnant by a boy she met locally. She tried to conceal the fact from her parents, tried to abort her baby with a pen, with castor oil, gin and hot baths. The pregnancy continued, however, and when her secret was out her stepfather confined her to her room for months. In the end, she went through labour prematurely in her own bed and despite the pain of her contractions says she 'did not make a sound, because I could not bear the thought of him hearing'. The baby, a boy she named Peter before he was taken from her, died later in hospital. I wonder what kind of psychological effect she thought having that child alone in her bedroom might have had? 'Well, for one thing,' she says, suddenly colder, or remembering only one extreme hurt in a lifetime of hurts, 'it ruined my bust, because they came and bound me up and I had awful stretch marks. I hated my breasts after that. And for another, I left home. I had to go.' In London, Keeler's daddy-shaped vacuum was filled by Stephen Ward. History has painted the curious osteopath, with an appointments book that included Prince Philip, Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor, as a political dilettante and social Mr Fixit; has seen his suicide, on the eve of his trumped-up conviction for living off immoral earnings, to be the final act in one of the most shaming episodes of British judicial history. In her book, Keeler presents a different picture of the man, if not of his fate. She suggests that Ward was, in fact, an important figure for Soviet intelligence: 'I don't know if he was the fourth man or the fifth... but he was certainly in the top 10...' and sketches him as a ruthless Cold Warrior, who conducted regular meetings with the likes of Anthony Blunt from his consulting rooms, who treated as a hired hand her one-time lover Eugene Ivanov, the Russian naval attach\u00e9 and spy, and who conspired, successfully as it turned out, to destabilise the Western alliance. Deconstructing the nature of Ward's influence over her, she suggests that he saw in her 'an ability to keep her mouth shut' and a crippling insecurity on which he could work. It was, she claims, after she had witnessed meetings between Ward and Sir Roger Hollis, head of MI5, and delivered, on his behalf, documents to the Russian Embassy, that Ward wanted to destroy her, thinking she knew too much. (In fact, she only discovered who Hollis was, she suggests, when Lord Denning showed her a picture of him during their interview for the inquiry; the spymaster, also named by Peter Wright as working for the Russians, was subsequently investigated four times as a double agent and exonerated on each occasion.) Whatever the truth of Keeler's allegations, Ward certainly worked in mysterious ways. She cites a near fatal boating accident, when she believed Ward tried to drown her. 'I knew he wanted to, but I could see in his eyes that he could not do it. But I knew at that point that he was going to have it done.' With this in mind, she implies compelling motives for his subsequent bizarre patterns of behaviour: proposals of marriage (prompted she believes by the law which states that a wife cannot turn evidence against her husband); his attempts to discredit her with the authorities (Ward informed the police that she had had a drug habit after he had instructed her to buy some dope which they smoked together); and his efforts to introduce her to more and more desperate figures, concluding with the West Indian caf\u00e9 owner Lucky Gordon, who imprisoned and raped Keeler on two occasions, each time, she says, after Ward let him know where she lived. Looking back now, and despite all of this, she seems unwilling to find anger or hatred for Ward, however. From the outset, she says, she 'trusted in him, believed in him, of course like a father' and the root of that trust lay in the fact that he was the first man she had ever met in her adult life, despite his well-documented sexual appetites, who 'did not try to grab hold of me. I mean, men, all men, were always trying to get hold of me, you know...' He used to say that other men were 'all bastards, following their pricks', but he let her know he was different. 'I absolutely respected him, for that,' she says now. 'He loved life. Everything he did he made to seem a wonderful thing to do.' But didn't he also procure lovers for her? Wasn't it Ward who suggested she went with Profumo and Ivanov? Who introduced her to Peter Rachman, the property racketeer, who kept her for a time in a flat, had sex with her every afternoon, never once looking her in the eye? She says it was, but mostly, she argues, 'we lived a very quiet life.We'd never go out. We once went to that sex orgy, and I didn't like it, and that was that. And there were maybe one or two cocktail parties'. She struggles for the names of their party hosts. 'A Guinness, maybe, a McAlpine.' Keeler is generally calm, philosophical, as she relates this history, but she flares up at anything I say that carries even the vaguest implication that she was a call girl. This false characterisation of her, one which has stuck so firmly, was, she believes, the deliberate invention of Lord Denning who seemed determined, at a time when spies were embarrassing Britain in the eyes of its American allies, to present the Profumo case as a sexual scandal rather than as another espionage story. She claims she told Denning most of what appears in her book, and cites in her argument the fact that Denning wanted to destroy all the interviews that led to his report, and eventually managed to get them officially sealed until 2045. 'We knew we were talking about spies,' she says. 'And I knew he knew I knew. But, of course, I was digging my own grave. Denning decided that I would be the lying prostitute. And he knew full well that the only lying prostitute there was Mandy Rice-Davies...' To clarify the point, Keeler casts around for a modern equivalent of the girl she really had been, back then. 'I was,' she says, 'probably someone not unlike an It Girl, in my day. I mean, I was out to have a good time. I was very young, 18, 19, and I wanted to work. I always wanted to work, to be a model, or an actress or whatever.' I wonder why she did not try to go public with her stories about Ward and Hollis at the time or subsequently (Hollis died in 1972) and she says that mostly it was through fear. She believed, still believes to an extent, that the security services wanted her dead. She points to a CIA memo which could be seen to imply that both she and Mariella Novotny, friend of Stephen Ward, former lover of both John and Robert Kennedy and hostess of sado-masochistic parties for British establishment figures, were on an unofficial agency hit list. More improbably, she refers to a documentary made at around the time of the 1989 film Scandal in which Lucky Gordon was interviewed, and again informed of where she was living ('not which tower block, exactly, but on which floor, the eleventh') as evidence that people were still trying to have her killed. Fantasy or not, she was so frightened on seeing it that she and her son moved out of their home overnight. Keeler's version of the events of her own life is, as she tells it, both temptingly plausible and impossible to verify. She views alternative narratives, such as Michael Caton-Jones's film Scandal and the book, Honeytrap, on which it was based, as the Denning Report in a different guise: if not part of a deliberate cover-up then further evidence of the casual misogyny and sexism that has hidden the truth and destroyed her life. Not surprisingly, Stephen Dorrill, co-author of the book and film, and an authority on the British Secret Service, dismisses Keeler's claims about both as 'all untrue and total rubbish'. When I asked him on the phone which parts of her story he did not believe, he simply said 'all of it', suggesting that Keeler's knowledge of the security services was such that in the past she was in the habit of referring to them as the 'social security'. To back up this condemnation, Dorrill cited the testimony of figures such as Robert Harbinson, a friend both of Ward and Blunt, who attested that the pair never had any dealings with each other. And he pointed out that there is no evidence at all to link Ward with Hollis (other, that is, than Keeler's eyewitness accounts). Dorrill seemed happy enough, too, to fall in with the kind of character assassination with which Keeler is all too familiar. 'Christine is dishonourable in the way she treats people who cannot defend themselves now they have died,' he said in passing, dismissing out of hand her claims to have become pregnant by John Profumo as 'obvious nonsense'. 'In general,' he suggested, recalling his own efforts to get to the truth of the story, 'we came to the conclusion that Mandy Rice-Davies was pretty accurate about events, but Christine wasn't.' Rice-Davies was happy to co-operate with the film, but Keeler was not. In conclusion, Dorrill suggested that I asked Keeler how many abortions she had had in her life, and that I inquire of her the extent to which she had been involved in pornography. 'Given the amount of drugs she has taken over the years,' he said, 'I can't believe she can reconstruct any of these ancient conversations at all.' Caroline Coon, campaigner on liberal issues and a friend of Keeler's since the Sixties, dismisses any suggestion that Keeler has been drug dependent as 'absolute fucking nonsense' and argues that it is 'hypocritical codswallop of any of the slew of men who have made a fortune out of Christine to question her motives for coming out with her story now'. She suggests that over the years, Keeler has never been offered enough money by anyone to justify telling her story and 'everyone, all those self-righteous men, have always wanted something for nothing from her'. (In Keeler's own account, she was paid \u00a35,000 to attend the premiere of Scandal, a tacit endorsement, and sat through the film with gritted teeth.) 'I wish and hope,' Coon says, 'that Christine will never be in a position to want for money again. She, of anyone, deserves to make a fortune out of her story. Remember, in all of this, she was the only one who ever went to prison for what happened.' Coon is working on a large-scale history painting of her friend. It is a portrait, she hopes, which will show both the most beautiful woman she ever met (at 26, Coon says, Keeler had skin 'like that of a pearl, a transfixing beauty') and one which incorporates 'what happens when a young working-class girl gets scapegoated, as Christine was so criminally'. One of the things that moved Keeler to tell her story now was watching the Lewinsky hearings, seeing the ways in which power would always conspire to destroy the character of individuals who threatened it. She has watched, too, over the years, the rehabilitation of John Profumo KBE who, through his penitent charity work, has achieved saint-like status. She smiles a little when she recalls how Margaret Thatcher called Profumo a 'national hero' and mentions, too, that he received an invitation to the Queen Mother's recent birthday celebrations. She, no doubt, wonders how this man, whose initial response to the allegations was to lie to the House of Commons and to ask in private 'who's going to believe a word of this tart?' can rightly reclaim his good name when that opportunity has never been afforded to her. After she came out of prison (she went in for an 18-month perjury sentence relating to a detail in the trial of Johnnie Edgecombe, who fired shots at her), she had various attempts at restarting her life, but Christine Keeler always returned to haunt her. She married twice, the first occasion in the Sixties to a man from her home town, but they split up after she was pursued by a stalker. Her second marriage in the early Seventies, to a self-made businessman, was equally disastrous. Both of her husbands left her with a son. The eldest, Jimmy, was brought up by Keeler's mother, against her wishes, and they are no longer in touch ('She turned him against me from an early age,' she says of her mother, 'but he has the house I gave them. So why should he bother with me?'); the youngest, Seymour, has been her life's saving grace. Since 1978, Keeler has had no men in her life, or at least none she has been prepared to live with. 'I'm terrified of men these days,' she says, a little sadly. 'That's the truth. If someone asked me out now, I don't know what I'd say, how I'd react. But I couldn't go through with it, not at all. I suppose I've been terrified of them all along. But it's only now I realise it...' At least, she says, as a single mother, she has been able to ensure that 'no one was ever, not for one night, going to put my son through anything that I had to suffer, make him be afraid or lie awake. And I never found anyone who was good enough, who I could trust enough, to take on the position of his father.' Financially, they have always struggled. Any money Keeler ever made from her name was given to her mother, she says, or lost to a crooked business manager. She spent many years dealing with the Inland Revenue about questions over earnings she never received. In recent years, she has tried to work in various jobs, under her assumed surname, Sloane. She sold advertising space for a magazine, found a job as a receptionist in a dry cleaners and, most recently in 1995, was a dinner lady at a school in London. When the headmaster discovered who she was, she was dismissed without explanation. 'After that, I didn't have the confidence,' she says. 'I sold up and moved down to the sea, lived on the DSS for a while, but I hated that... never want to go back to that.' And so she decided to tell her story. Looking back, now, I wonder who she really blames for what has happened in her life? 'Denning,' she says, without missing a beat. Not Stephen Ward? 'Well, Stephen was utterly ruthless, he had to be stopped. But they had to shut me up, too. And that was Denning. He told the lies.' And what of Profumo, her nemesis, what does she remember now of their star-crossed affair? 'I won't say I didn't like it at the time, the sex that is, because I wouldn't have let him do it at all, of course not, if that had been the case. He had a way with him. Before you had a chance to say no he was there and done,' she says. 'That only happened to me once before, with a duke, who literally swept me off my feet, and before I knew what was happening, you know we'd done it,' she smiles. 'Another terrible mistake.' In her book, she claims that after Profumo saw her for the last time, she discovered she was pregnant and had a further abortion. Why did she not tell him? 'Well,' she says, 'you have to believe that I didn't want to hurt him any more than I had done already...' When she talks about Profumo, it is with an air of weariness, a quiet acknowledgement of the way that name will forever be yoked to hers, and of the lives she might have lived had she never heard it. If her book had been a novel, I suggest, before I leave, she would have to bump into this man one more time. Does she have any idea what she would say? She thinks for a while. 'I don't know,' she says finally. 'I don' t know even if I ruined his life. I certainly changed it.' She looks up. 'He's got a girlfriend, I hear,' she says. 'He's 85 and he's met another woman.' She laughs, a little, at the oddity of the thought. 'Still, at 85, why ever not?' Christine Keeler and the Profumo Scandal 2 February 1942: Christine Keeler was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex 1959: She meets Stephen Ward, osteopath to the rich and powerful, at Murray's nightclub where she is a showgirl. September 1960: Mandy Rice Davies starts work at Murray's. February 1961: Keeler moves into Ward's Wimpole Mews flat where she says she witnessed him meeting Eugene Ivanov, the director general of MI5 Sir Roger Hollis and Anthony Blunt. June 1961: Keith Wagstaffe, a Hollis underling from MI5, comes to Ward's Wimpole Mews flat. The security services have become suspicious of Ivanov and of Ward's friendship with him. Ward starts to see Keeler as a 'ticking bomb'. 8 July 1961: Ward introduces Keeler to John Profumo, Secretary of State for War, at Cliveden. Ward's aim was for Christine to find out from Profumo through 'pillow talk... when nuclear warheads were being moved to Germany'. October 1961: Keeler becomes pregnant by Profumo. She has an abortion three months later. 14 December 1962: Keeler's ex-boyfriend Johnnie Edgecombe tries to shoot her at the Wimpole Mews flat. The police are called and the attention of the media is drawn to Ward and the people (and agents) who come and go from his flat. 22 March 1963: Profumo makes a personal statement to the House of Commons denying his involvement with Keeler. 5 June 1963: Jack Profumo resigns. 30 July 1963: Stephen Ward obtains Nembutal and kills himself. 1963: Keeler is jailed for nine months for perjury. The Photographer, His Chair, That Image and the Copycats... Lewis Morley: Christine came into my studio at the Establishment Club in Soho for a publicity shoot for a movie that never got made. The session was very quick. I took a couple of rolls of her in a little jerkin she was wearing. Then there was a bit of a tiswas because the movie producers wanted her to be photographed nude and she wasn't keen. So I got rid of everybody from the studio. I told her I would turn my back and she took all her clothes off. She later said she kept her knickers on. She didn't, but I won't argue with that. She was quite coy. Not blatant at all. I said to her: 'Sit behind that chair and you'll still be fulfilling the nude bit in your contract.' It was a cheap copy of an Arne Jacobson chair from Heals' sale. I've still got it. I only took one roll of her on the chair. It all took 10 minutes at the most. The whole thing was very relaxed as far as I was concerned. I didn't think about what was happening. It was a job. It just happened to snowball. Its been good and bad in that I've done a lot of work, but on the other hand people only know me through the Keeler photograph. For years I hardly made a penny out of it: maybe \u00a33,000, when it could have been worth a hundred times that. In 1989 I won back the copyright. Matt Groening sent me a drawing of Homer Simpson on the chair. I like that very much. In The Photographer's Chair After taking the iconic shot of Keeler, Morley was regularly asked to shoot other people in the same pose. Those who have straddled the chair for him include: David Frost at the height of the Profumo scandal, as a publicity stunt for That Was The Week That Was. Joe Orton in 1965, as a publicity shot for his play Loot. Edina Ronay the fashion designer Barry Humphries as Dame Edna Everage Others who have copied the chair pose over the years include: The Spice Girls to publicise their song, Naked in 1998 Emma Milne, the Vets In Practice celebrity, to publicise an anti-hunt campaign in 1999 Keith Chegwin with socks on, May 2000 Jodie Kidd in an ad for developer Saxon Homes, June 2000 Alison Steadman to publicise her current appearance at the Arts Theatre in London in Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane. The male cast did the pose too Christine Keeler replicated the pose eight years ago with Terry O'Neill for a newspaper article to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the Profumo Scandal.

They are written by critics and scholars, not all of them film specialists, and this study of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's surreal masterpiece, the sixtieth in the series, is by a British literary academic who is currently professor of English and comparative studies at Princeton University. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel is the sixth director so far to be the subject of two BFI Film Classics (the previous ones are Bergman, Lang, Ford, Welles and Hawks). The earlier book was on his outrageous, long-banned avant-garde L'Age d'Or (1930); Wood's monograph concerns the equally controversial picture he made when he was 66, his hearing seriously impaired and his daily intake of alcohol phenomenal. </p> <p>Bu\u00f1uel had disappeared from Europe in the Thirties to emerge in Mexico in 1950 with Los Olvidados. A decade later, he returned to Europe to shake Franco's Spain with the subversive Viridiana (1961). Then, with Belle de Jour, he was accorded his first large budget, the services of a great colour cinematographer, Sacha Vierny, and the perfect screenwriter in Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re. He was to make another five films, four scripted by Carri\u00e8re. These tough, mature, far from mellow pictures are among the great late flowerings of any artist of the last century.</p> <p>The story of Belle de Jour is simple. A haute-bourgeoisie Parisian wife, Severine (Catherine Deneuve), takes an afternoon job in a smart brothel in search of a cure for her frigidity. The narrative treatment, however, unlike Joseph Kessel's 1928 novel on which it's based, dovetails reality, fantasy and autobiographical flashbacks in a uniformly direct style. </p> <p>'I myself couldn't say what is real and what is imaginary in the film,' Bu\u00f1uel observed. 'For me, they form a single thing.' Wood doesn't try to provide answers, or guess what Severine's plump oriental client kept in that famous lacquered box. What he does is to clarify the social and aesthetic questions this film raises. He vividly describes Bu\u00f1uel's style as 'a way of flinging a world at us, like litter, rather than laying it out like a lawn'. The best comment, as always, is by the old surrealist himself: 'Belle de Jour is a pornographic film; by that, I mean chaste eroticism.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Belle de Jour Michael Wood BFI Publishing \u00a38.99, pp80 Buy it at a discount at BOL The British Film Institute's handsomely designed Film Classic series was launched 10 years ago to provide accompanying monographs to a repertory of 360 movies to be shown on a year-round basis at the Museum of the Moving Image. They are written by critics and scholars, not all of them film specialists, and this study of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's surreal masterpiece, the sixtieth in the series, is by a British literary academic who is currently professor of English and comparative studies at Princeton University. Bu\u00f1uel is the sixth director so far to be the subject of two BFI Film Classics (the previous ones are Bergman, Lang, Ford, Welles and Hawks). The earlier book was on his outrageous, long-banned avant-garde L'Age d'Or (1930); Wood's monograph concerns the equally controversial picture he made when he was 66, his hearing seriously impaired and his daily intake of alcohol phenomenal. Bu\u00f1uel had disappeared from Europe in the Thirties to emerge in Mexico in 1950 with Los Olvidados. A decade later, he returned to Europe to shake Franco's Spain with the subversive Viridiana (1961). Then, with Belle de Jour, he was accorded his first large budget, the services of a great colour cinematographer, Sacha Vierny, and the perfect screenwriter in Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re. He was to make another five films, four scripted by Carri\u00e8re. These tough, mature, far from mellow pictures are among the great late flowerings of any artist of the last century. The story of Belle de Jour is simple. A haute-bourgeoisie Parisian wife, Severine (Catherine Deneuve), takes an afternoon job in a smart brothel in search of a cure for her frigidity. The narrative treatment, however, unlike Joseph Kessel's 1928 novel on which it's based, dovetails reality, fantasy and autobiographical flashbacks in a uniformly direct style. 'I myself couldn't say what is real and what is imaginary in the film,' Bu\u00f1uel observed. 'For me, they form a single thing.' Wood doesn't try to provide answers, or guess what Severine's plump oriental client kept in that famous lacquered box. What he does is to clarify the social and aesthetic questions this film raises. He vividly describes Bu\u00f1uel's style as 'a way of flinging a world at us, like litter, rather than laying it out like a lawn'. The best comment, as always, is by the old surrealist himself: 'Belle de Jour is a pornographic film; by that, I mean chaste eroticism.'",

The example he always cited was T. E. Lawrence; it is not surprising to find that Fenton, in a superbly embattled lecture on imperialism in poetry, transcribes a quotation from Lawrence of Arabia, which he saw pinned on the wall of the US embassy in Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War. The text advised the resident spooks and soldiers to behave like weaklings and desert their posts. </p> <p>Artists who imagine themselves to be strong arouse Fenton's suspicion. He begins with the story of Michelangelo crushing a sculpture brought to him by Giambologna, a feat of muscular bravado which exposed a secret fragility, since Michelangelo was destroying a potential rival. He finds the same violent egomania in Wordsworth's dismissal of Keats, and even explains the morbidity and pessimism of Larkin in military terms, as 'a critical scorched-earth policy'. Larkin declared the twentieth century to be null and void so as to ensure that no poets needed to be read after Hardy 'or none until you reach you know who'. </p> <p>Fenton, by contrast, admires weakness. He remarks on Wilfred Owen's 'desperate vulnerability to male beauty' and explains Auden's embarrassed reference to Wilde's 'The Portrait of Mr W. H. Auden', a fantasia about Shakespeare's erotic infatuation with the young man to whom he addressed the sonnets, by admitting that we always wince in later life when we revisit the books 'which meant most to us in our vulnerable youth'. (Incidentally, this sympathy with juvenile rawness must have endeared Fenton to his undergraduate audience and he is good throughout on the callow or bumptious antics of adolescent poets: Elizabeth Bishop at Vassar attending a recital by Edna St Vincent Millay and doubling up with hilarity at the old girl's prophetic posturing, or Sylvia Plath at Smith prissily censuring her fellow students when they altered the dress code in summer and exchanged Bermuda shorts for tattered jeans.) </p> <p>The Truly Weak Man, in Isherwood's psychiatric theory, hurls himself into combat self-destructively. War won't prove his strength; rather, it will confirm his weakness and conveniently expunge him. Fenton, whose books of poetry include The Memory of War, is in the odd position of being a non-combatant war poet. On the home front, he has had to make do with literary skirmishes, in which the participants wield imaginary guns with real bullets in them. Thus, recalling the way Al Alvarez denigrated Seamus Heaney in 1980 by mobilising the authority of T. S. Eliot, Fenton remarks: 'This is the cannon, and shares its determination to kill.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, polemical fury is no substitute for courage under fire. In these lectures, Fenton seems to be wondering out loud about whether he has missed a blooding which might have been an essential rite of passage for a poet or, perhaps, simply for a man. He muses on the case of Hemingway, whose near-crippling injuries incurred as an ambulance driver during the First World War, 'did not settle the question of his manhood'. </p> <p>But the forebear to whom he most insistently returns is Auden, who was never forgiven, or who maybe never forgave himself, for chickening out of a war. In 1939, he left for America, while the accusations of betrayal were still current in 1957 when, as Fenton reports with evident commiseration, 'he was terrified of giving his inaugural lecture as professor of poetry at Oxford'. </p> <p>Fenton's own last and best lecture considers Auden's plight and venerates him as a weak man, a specialist in unrequited love, who consoled himself for his private griefs by reasoning that 'art is born of humiliation', and a strong poet. The peroration, recalling a sermon in the form of graduation address delivered by Auden at Smith College in 1940, is startlingly eloquent. The lectern resembles a pulpit as, in biblical phraseology, Fenton chides England and especially Oxford for its rejection of Auden: 'It was given him to know this, and to doubt it, to know and to doubt it.' What Auden knew and doubted was his own poetic gift, described by Fenton (in a quote from Blake) as his 'lap full of seed'. The homosexual poet's seeds inseminate no one; the deracinated Auden considered himself homeless, and when he bought a house in the Vienna woods he called it a habitat, not a home. </p> <p>The book ends by accusing 'this lean country' in Auden's name. But since giving his last lecture, Fenton has concentrated on rewriting the sad end of Auden's life. His own map of seed won't be squandered, even if he writes no more poems: he has racinated himself in the countryside outside Oxford and you can read his gardening column every Saturday in the Guardian.</p>",

In 1939, he left for America, while the accusations of betrayal were still current in 1957 when, as Fenton reports with evident commiseration, 'he was terrified of giving his inaugural lecture as professor of poetry at Oxford'. Fenton's own last and best lecture considers Auden's plight and venerates him as a weak man, a specialist in unrequited love, who consoled himself for his private griefs by reasoning that 'art is born of humiliation', and a strong poet. The peroration, recalling a sermon in the form of graduation address delivered by Auden at Smith College in 1940, is startlingly eloquent. The lectern resembles a pulpit as, in biblical phraseology, Fenton chides England and especially Oxford for its rejection of Auden: 'It was given him to know this, and to doubt it, to know and to doubt it.' What Auden knew and doubted was his own poetic gift, described by Fenton (in a quote from Blake) as his 'lap full of seed'. The homosexual poet's seeds inseminate no one; the deracinated Auden considered himself homeless, and when he bought a house in the Vienna woods he called it a habitat, not a home. The book ends by accusing 'this lean country' in Auden's name. But since giving his last lecture, Fenton has concentrated on rewriting the sad end of Auden's life. His own map of seed won't be squandered, even if he writes no more poems: he has racinated himself in the countryside outside Oxford and you can read his gardening column every Saturday in the Guardian.",

For example, if you wanted to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, you would have to do it in your underwear with a penguin strapped to your back as the result of a pub bet or at least attempt to recreate the journey of a long-dead adventurer with a contemporary comic slant. </p> <p>'As soon as I hear the words \"travelling in the footsteps of\" come out of my mouth, I think, \"Oh God, that sounds so trite\",' says Tim Moore, author of Frost on My Moustache and now Continental Drifter, who favours the latter approach. </p> <p>'The temptation is for writers to go to more and more obscure places or to well-known places in more obscure ways, but I think people like to read about places they're familiar with and know a bit about.' </p> <p>Moore doesn't look like an adventurer; in fact, he looks as if he should play bass in a hopeful indy band. This is partly the point. 'The good thing about this kind of self-deprecating humour is that you can get away with highlighting how pathetic you are. You can say, \"Then I got really homesick and gave up\", whereas if you're more hairy-chested you can't.' </p> <p>Frost on My Moustache used this contrast to great effect. Moore, whose wife is Icelandic, followed the Icelandic voyage of Lord Dufferin, an indisputably hirsute nineteenth-century explorer, pitting his own feebleness against Dufferin's daring. In Continental Drifter, he uses the same device to follow the route of the Grand Tour, which, in his own description, began as a mobile academy of cultural betterment for the flower of English aristocratic youth and deteriorated rapidly into 'the Club 18-30 of the 1830s'. </p> <p>'The Grand Tour struck me as a good idea because when you see the average travelling Briton in Europe these days they're so ludicrous. It's astonishing to think that this is the legacy of Lord Byron going around Venice. I thought that if this is what British continental travel has come to, I wanted to find where it first started.' </p> <p>After some research, he turned up Thomas Coryate, author of the little-known Coryate's Crudities, which might properly be called the first English travelogue, 'a sort of \"Ruff Guide to Europe\".' Coryate was a parson's son from Somerset, who undertook his journey through Europe in 1608 for the purpose of garnering anecdotes, the better to impress the Prince of Wales. Moore decided to capitalise on Coryate's delusions of grandeur by undertaking his journey in a cantankerous Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow while wearing a velvet suit. </p> <p>'You get into these situations when you're driving an enormous, unreliable Rolls-Royce on your own. People will think they can take advantage of you; these Basil Fawlty-style hoteliers will pick on you because they can,' he says, which may partially explain his often less than flattering observations of our European neighbours. 'I read a lot of Evelyn Waugh,' he confesses. 'I liked his style of travel writing, kind of rude and scathing. Which is unfortunate, but there we are, I'm stuck with it.' </p> <p>Moore began writing for Record Mirror after leaving university, but the travelling seems to have been a legacy from his grandfather. 'He was a great traveller - he drove to India in a Land Rover when he was 74 - and when he died he left all his grandchildren three grand each, with the proviso that they used it for travel. I set off in a clapped-out Saab round eastern Europe and wrote a kind of potted account of that; everyone rejected it except the Independent. I was approached to write a book, but I'm so lazy it took me four years to come up with the proposal.' </p> <p>On the evidence, though, sloth is not a sin you would immediately accuse him of. Apart from this Grand Tour through France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Holland, he has also completed a third book, to be published in June, in which he follows the route of the Tour de France ('What's the gimmick there?' I ask. He looks outraged. 'The gimmick is me cycling 3,000 f***ing kilometres; how much more of a gimmick do you want? I've cycled the second highest road in Europe!') and is planning a jaunt through the length of the Roman Empire - 'It would mean going from Libya to Hadrian's Wall, which I thought would be an interesting idea. Now everyone will nick it.' </p> <p>Despite his family legacy and his secure place as the British heir to Bill Bryson's comic travel mantle, he has a dark secret. 'I've got this enormous phobia about insects. It's a shame because all the places that I could go to write about are places that I would pay a lot of money not to have to go to, because they're full of things I wouldn't want to encounter.' (I can confirm this: he refused to have his photograph taken until the photographer removed a spider from the pub doorway. Unfortunately, it landed on his foot.) 'A friend has booked me in for hypnotherapy because I need to get over it. There are only so many books you can do travelling in Europe. That was one of the nice things about Iceland.' </p> <p>There is also a limit to the number of genuinely funny anecdotes you can obtain in a two-month trip, and one of the difficulties of this kind of travel writing is the obligation to keep the humour at full throttle throughout, so that at times the book labours under a weight of irrelevant reminiscences about his schooldays or family.</p> <p>But there are some splendid moments; his search for cannabis in a small Dutch town ('I managed to find the one person in Holland who didn't speak English, and I had to stand in a dark street bellowing, \"I want to buy drugs!\" through an intercom') and his near-fatal attempt to pilot a boat in Venice: 'I still have nightmares about it, it was really scary. I forced myself because I felt that Coryate was such a nutcase; he did all kinds of things that he shouldn't have done, and I thought I ought to try instead of taking the easy option and staying in hotels. But it was terrible. They have one-way canals and the gondoliers kept hitting me with their poles and yelling at me to get out of the way. Then the motor cut out.' He shudders. 'I can't even think about it now.' </p> <p>But for all its digressions, Continental Drifter is vivid, if a little caustic, in its observations of Europe and has a stamp of authenticity, which Moore attributes to 'a stunted imagination'. 'I'd love to write fiction, but I'm not good enough.

And for one very good reason. Two decades of merger and takeover, coupled with a dizzying tempo of technological change, have made publishing houses so massive and complex that they are now beyond the competence of one individual to manage. Historically, talented editors got promoted into management, then learnt through a gruelling process of trial and error how to read a balance sheet and to manage an inventory.

These publishers, of whom Morgan Entrekin, of Grove Atlantic, and Roger Straus Sr, of Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, are probably the supreme living examples, were an exquisite mixture of aesthete and mafioso, people of the most refined sensibilities who would, at the same time, take no hostages in the cut-and-thrust of book business. The nearest we've had to such figures in this country are Carmen Callil, the co-founder of Virago, and Christopher MacLehose, the publisher of Harvill. They don't make them like that any more. And for one very good reason. Two decades of merger and takeover, coupled with a dizzying tempo of technological change, have made publishing houses so massive and complex that they are now beyond the competence of one individual to manage. Historically, talented editors got promoted into management, then learnt through a gruelling process of trial and error how to read a balance sheet and to manage an inventory. Many of them did not survive. A few exceptional ones came through. They had names like Victor Gollancz, Jonathan Cape and Allen Lane. Today, in a much less forgiving and far more costly business environment, there is no longer room for such experimentation, as the recent career obituaries in the trade press have vividly illustrated. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk",

It has always seemed fair to be in charge. It is, after all, grown-ups that have to read the books over and over again. When you ask young children whether they like a book, they almost always say 'Yes', but can seldom tell you why. It has suited me to conclude that young children are undiscriminating and to ignore any evidence to the contrary. </p> <p>But recently I have been confounded by my son Ted, who - at two - has made it clear that he not only has strong preferences but will overrule my choices, often throwing the book that I am offering him to the ground and thrusting his own choice on to my lap in its place. It is he - this flamboyant critic - who has led me, reluctantly, to concede that I may have been wrong for a long time. I have even started to observe that the other children also often smuggle unwelcome books on to my knee. They have opinions of their own. So this is a piece about my children's favourite books. Their choices sometimes coincide with mine. But not always. Some have forced their way in against my better judgment. </p> <p> <strong> Family choice</strong> (at least we agree about this one) </p> <p> Every now and then a picture book comes along which instantly roots itself in our lives. If it gets lost, it is a mini-disaster. Right now, The Terrible Underpants by Kaz Cooke (Viking \u00a39.99) is that book. Cooke is an Australian cartoonist and the book should, ideally, be read aloud in a thick, laconic Australian accent. </p> <p>Meet a girl called Wanda Linda and Glenda, a hairy-nosed wombat. Wanda Linda has parents who cannot control the laundry and, in particular, the underwear situation. Result: Wanda Linda has to wear a hyperbolically dreadful pair of underpants. We are not spared any details: the grey, drooping backview, the defective elastic, the torn front complete with cordial stain. </p> <p>We all love the crazily overblown plot in which the minor humiliation of wearing the pants becomes an international affair when somebody in a helicopter takes a picture of Wanda in them and puts it on TV: 'And EVERYBODY in the WHOLE WORLD saw The Terrible Underpants.' It also works beautifully as drama. I play Wanda. My oldest son Leo (nine) plays Glenda the traumatised wombat. (He finds it hysterically funny.) All ends happily with what might become an Australian dejeuner sur l'herbe. Wanda takes the disgraceful pants off and (still decent) sits down to enjoy a cuppa. The weird thing is that, unlike the terrible underpants, this great book never seems to wear thin. </p> <p> <strong> Os's choice</strong> (age four and a half)</p> <p>Some Things are Scary by Florence Parry Heide, illustrated by Jules Feiffer (Walker \u00a39.99) This book troubles me. Why introduce into children's heads the idea that things are scary? They find so much frightening without throwing new ingredients into the already murky pot.</p> <p>This book is a list of scary ideas that ends with a picture of a child swamped in a grown-up's clothes: an overwhelming overcoat, heavy briefcase, shirt and tie. The child's face is wan; its mouth is turned down. The text reads: 'Knowing you're going to grow up to be a grown-up is scary.' Os loves it. He goes through it with his twin agreeing or disagreeing with each proposition. Long after we have finished reading, he will sit leafing through it and brooding. And he is not fazed by the last picture at all. On the contrary, he explained to me: everyone grows up so there is no use being scared. </p> <p> <strong> Ted's choice</strong> (age two)</p> <p>I am devoted to Shirley Hughes books but not - how could I be? - as devoted as Ted. He will not read anything that has not been written and illustrated by Shirley Hughes. He will go through piles of books and select her unmistakable style every time.</p> <p>Perhaps she reflects the way he would like his life to be? She paints a picture of ideal, middle-class family life: mothers who are calm, kind and industrious, wiping away tears, baking cakes, presiding over playtime. And Ted identifies with Hughes's portrayal of busy people like himself. (His favourites include: Playing; Being Together; Helping; Keeping Busy (Walker each at \u00a32.99); Bathwater's Hot; (Walker \u00a34.99) Noisy (Walker \u00a34.99) Colours (Walker \u00a34.99).</p> <p>For similarly besotted children, The Shirley Hughes Collection (Bodley Head, \u00a319.99) is a good way to kill several birds with one stone. And there is a new Alfie book Alfie Weather (Bodley Head \u00a39.99) to look forward to coming out in March - Alfie, amazingly, is 20 this year. </p> <p>There is one non-fictional exception to the Hughes monopoly: a Dorling Kindersley book Kitty's Adventure (part of a series that includes a fire engine, a car and a puppy). It is easy to underrate the Dorling Kindersley style, if only because most of its books depend on the same formula. But the formula is brilliant and it works: children love the literal quality of the photographs - the absence of imagination or fudging. And this book is a lovely example of the genre with a large but charming marmalade kitten pursuing a shocking pink feather. It is produced in firm, toddler-proof cardboard with a blue button that will let out a most authentic meow. I find it lacking in narrative interest, but it has been fantastically popular. There has been fighting over this book so that when it is not being read, it now lives on a high shelf. </p> <p> <strong> Bernie's choice</strong> (age four and a half) </p> <p>Rattletrap Car by Phyllis Root illustrated by Jill Barton (Viking \u00a39.99). I fancy we are back in Australia in this jolly book. It is about trying to get a derelict car to a lake on a boiling summer's day.

Jez Alborough's Hug ( Walker \u00a39.99) is not a book I like. It is too simple, sentimental and jauntily pleased with itself. On the cover, there is a cheeky monkey and the single word in chubby red letters HUG. The monkey is hoping for a hug from its absentee parents. It passes affectionate elephants and devoted hippos hugging each other enthusiastically. There is almost no text save the word 'hug'. The children clamour for second helpings. They seem to regard the little monkey with almost patronising understanding. And they adore the drama of the eventual mother and child reunion. </p> <p> <strong> Bernie and Os</strong> </p> <p>Beetle in the Bathroom by Brian Moses and Sonia Holleyman (Puffin \u00a34.99) It has been decided (not by me) that this happily infested book must live in the bathroom with the plastic ducks and be read during bathtime.

Maybe, like me, you rather like the sharp, witty series, and so bought her new book, 4 Blondes, in a three-for-the-price-of-two deal. Trouble is, after reading it, I'm not so sure I haven't been had. </p> <p>Is 4 Blondes, as advertised, a collection of short stories revolving around the trials and tribulations of contemporary femininity in the urban jungle of the 21st century? Or, is it, as it reads, a literary Exhibit A in the case for how irredeemably ghastly women have become. Not women like me or you, you understand. Women like Candace. Professional 'blondes' like Candace. Misanthropic, flint hearted, Brazilian-waxed, hustling pieces of work like Candace. And, excuse my xenophobia (the bad breath of international relations), certain American women like Candace. </p> <p>Because reading 4 Blondes, my recurring thought was: for all our sins, for all our problems, this couldn't happen here. British women don't hate themselves enough to buy the crude sketches of femininity offered up as 'characters' in 4 Blondes: a good-time girl signing up for sexual slavery in return for summer at the Hamptons; a wife who despises her husband for not being successful enough; a pill-popping trophy wife, and a revised version of an article Bushnell wrote for a British newspaper a few years ago about how lousy British men are in bed - how they all have tiny penises, never wash, and last approximately two minutes. As I said at the time: this is what you get when you do all your research within a square mile of Mayfair. </p> <p>Pushing aside for one moment how tragic it is for Bushnell to deem it classy to call her book 4 Blondes (most blondes have realised by now that they're merely affordable glamour for men who can't afford Ferraris), isn't it a bit rich for an American woman to insult British men in this way, not least as Bushnell is currently hooked up with a Brit? During the war, American GIs were famously denounced as over-paid, over-sexed and over here. Now we seem to have been lumbered with a female American writer who is over-paid, under-sexed and over here. What price progress? At least the GIs dolled out nylons and chocolate. All we get from Bushnell is tacky, unnecessary remarks about our menfolk's penis size, which, frankly, Candace darling, is not the British way. For all that the likes of Fay Weldon are always wailing and whining about British women hating men, the fact is that we don't. It's all just sport. </p> <p>While British women adore to slag off our men, we do it in such a way that we actually talk them up. When we call them immature commitment-phobic slobs, we do so safe in the knowledge that we're making the sorriest of wimps feel a bit 'dangerous'. In return, men rant about how British women are 'such ballbreakers!' even though everyone knows that scented candles are still outselling female knuckledusters a million to one. Like I said, it's just sport - fun, bloodless, all but victimless. Everyone gets their round in, and there's no tears by bedtime. Compare and contrast this playful inter-gender sparring to Bushnell's acid emasculation, all that scary, nasty stuff about 'very small willies', and you get some clue as to why she and her mates spent so many hours bitterly sipping Manhattans alone in East Village bars. </p> <p>In my opinion, Bushnell's essay on British men has exposed her as a fraud. It reminds me of when I was enjoying PJ O'Rourke's collections of travelogues in war zones, Holidays in Hell, until I came to his appalling, trite essay on The Irish Troubles. It was only then that I realised that O'Rourke had probably been just as crap on, say, Cuba, only I'd been too thick and ill-informed to realise it. So it is with Bushnell. It is only when she writes so badly about British culture that you start to twig that she may not be the oracle on New York sexual mores we've been led to believe. Frankly, Bushnell could have claimed that New Yorkers like to have sex wearing Minnie Mouse ears, and Twinkies up their nostrils, and we wouldn't have known any better. </p> <p>It also seems salient to note that, of all the Sex and the City spin-offs, the TV series has proved to be the most accomplished. So, that'll be the TV series that is not written by Bushnell. That'll be the hit TV series about heterosexual odysseys, adored by women worldwide, but written, one hears, by a talented team of homosexual male writers. All things considered, that little sociological factette seems to say more about the state of play on Planet Hetero 2001 than Candace Bushnell ever could.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Contrary to popular sentimental beliefs, he does not find this particularly comforting. Indeed, 'the day that he broke her favourite cup when he was doing the washing up', writes Desarthe, 'he put his hands up to protect his head, like a child afraid of being smacked'. Fearful of some unimaginable punishment, Max decides to commission a portrait of his late wife. This is not only a tribute but a 'counter-attack' to the haunting: a portrait as peace offering, so to speak.</p> <p>Five Photos of My Wife is Agn\u00e8s Desarthe's English debut. One of France's bestselling authors, her third novel is a funny, unpredictable tale: just as it seems to be one thing, it turns into another, and a study of loss and grief becomes a gentle poke at art and its pretensions. </p> <p>Max chooses at random five artists from the Parisian equivalent of the Yellow Pages, for each of whom he has selected the same five photographs of his wife in order for them to complete their task: to produce a straightforward, painterly rendition of Telma. This simple request, almost pathetic in its doomed hopefulness, is - like Max - at odds with the times. </p> <p>'I am stealing your image. You agree to the theft, but the infraction is still there. It's all part of it,' lectures Fred\u00e9ric, a young art student and one of those commissioned. As payment for painting Telma, Max has agreed to be videoed by Fred\u00e9ric, sitting still and doing nothing. Bewildered and faintly irritated, none the less Max is no slouch: he recognises that the boy is 'a hippie [who has] silenced his own opinions to fall back on slogans'. </p> <p>Desarthe is not so simplistic as to interpret extreme age as a constant state of passive na\u00efvety. In Max, an 80-year-old man, she has created a constant source of surprise. Not only is he trying to make sense of his loss and his often bitter memories of Telma, but he is looking forward, evaluating this shocking new world, his future and his relationships with his adult children. </p> <p>The novel is interspersed with Max's letters to his son and daughter, in which he is at his most vulnerable and at his funniest: 'I can't say that I've taught you everything that I know,' he writes to his son, 'because, in amongst it all, there were quite a lot of odds and ends that wouldn't have been any use to you.' And to his daughter: 'I've had a letter from your brother and I don't understand a word of it. He doesn't say hello or tell me how he is. If it weren't for the envelope I wouldn't have even understood that it was a letter.' </p> <p>Desarthe is less opaque than her (equally successful) contemporary, Marie Darrieussecq, but she is as daring and imaginative a writer. Through Max Opass, she lets her lucid prose plunder dreams and question the meaning of existence. Most of all, with wit and fondness, she expresses the pity of old age.</p>",

Although the British have traditionally eschewed the 'compensation culture' of the US, high-profile advertising promoting the chance to pursue a claim at no apparent cost to the claimant are winning customers. </p> <p>These new services are intended to help anyone who has been hurt in an accident through no fault of their own to claim compensation. Any accident could give rise to a potential claim, from tripping on an uneven paving slab to suffering injuries in a car crash. With the exception of certain cases involving minors or medical negligence, the claim must be lodged within three years of the accident. On contacting a claims management service, your claim will be given an initial assessment. If the service believes you have a good chance (generally 51 per cent or more) of winning damages, you will be referred to a solicitor and asked to undergo a medical assessment. </p> <p>However, further legislative changes introduced in April 2000 have encouraged the introduction of 'success' fees by solicitors and the sale of expensive 'after the event' insurance policies, designed to protect claimants from costs if they lose their case. Insurers are contesting the validity of these extra costs, claiming that in many cases these costs are unnecessary because the insurer has admitted liability. The Association of British Insurers says that the increased cost of personal injury claims is already feeding into the cost of car insurance, and it believes that if the practice of selling expensive 'after the event' policies and charging success fees continues, insurance premiums will inevitably rise. </p> <p>The disagreement over costs has resulted in a stand-off, with some insurers refusing to pay the success fees and insurance policy costs demanded by solicitors. Since April last year, Claims Direct has managed to recover the cost of its insurance premium in just 100 cases. Insurers have refused to pay up in a further 400 cases. In many of the cases, Claims Direct has deducted the full cost of the insurance premium (\u00a31,312) from the claimant's damages until the insurer pays up. </p> <p>Norwich Union is considering trying to settle the argument once and for all by appealing against the costs awarded to one claimant injured in a car crash. </p> <p>Martin Cockx, senior partner with Manchester solicitors Amerlans, explains that before the widespread introduction of 'after the event' policies, many potential claimants were put off claiming for fear of ending up out of pocket if they lost. Before April 2000, claimants usually had to pay their solicitors an hourly rate as their case proceeded. If they won their case, they could recoup these costs from the defendant, but if they lost they would not only have to foot their own solicitor's fees but also those of the opposing side. </p> <p>However, insurers believe that some claims management firms are taking advantage of the new legislation to push up costs. Suzanne Moore of the ABI says: 'There is a concern that some of the claims for costs are not at a reasonable level. Where insurers feel the costs are not reasonable, they won't pay them.' </p> <p>The policies being offered by some claims management firms certainly vary widely in cost. 121legals, which charges a set fee of \u00a3900, says the costs vary because each firm's policy offers different levels of cover. Claims Direct spokesman Tony Wright defends his firm's higher charge, saying that the fee is all encompassing, covering the insurance premium, solicitor's fees and any other costs. </p> <p>In theory, the claimant does not have to pay anything from his own pocket, as the premium is arranged as a personal loan which the claimant is not responsible for repaying. If the claim is successful, the defendant pays the premium as part of the costs, and if the claim is unsuccessful, the policy pays out to cover all disbursements, including the premium. </p> <p>But Andrew Flowers, of the online claims firm easyClaims.com, warns that while 'reasonable' costs can be recovered from the defendant's insurer under the Access to Justice Act, inflated costs may be rejected. 'Any shortfall between the claims management company and the amount of unrecovered costs is deducted from the claimant's damages,' says Flowers. </p> <p>The ABI's Suzanne Moore says that the insurance industry needs clarification about what should be considered a reasonable cost. However a precedent is unlikely to be set by just one case, as the circumstances vary widely from one case to another. </p> <p>She says: 'This [clarification] is gradually happening through the courts as cases are settled. In some cases the judges find in favour of the claimants and in others they find for the insurers. But it is a very slow process. Ideally we would like formal guidance from the Lord Chancellor's Department.' </p> <p>Until this happens, the ABI is hoping that the parties involved - the claims management firms, the solicitors, and the insurers - can come to some agreement over how much can reasonably be charged. In the meantime, potential claimants can save money and aggravation by checking whether they already have legal expenses insurance as part of existing general insurance policies. In these circumstances they are unlikely to need 'after the event' insurance. </p> <p>They should also be careful in their choice of claims management company - remember that these firms are not regulated - and check the terms and conditions applied. <a href=\"http://www.easyClaims.com\">easyClaims.com</a>, for example, promises that none of its customers' damages will be used to cover legal costs or insurance premiums. 'The client is guaranteed to get 100 per cent of damages if they win and incur no costs if they lose. The client pays nothing at any stage,' says Flowers. </p> <p>Alternatively, claimants can cut out the middlemen by going directly to a firm of solicitors specialising in personal injury work, and will work on a no-win, no-fee basis.

It is a lot less valued if everyone gets one, the competition is sparse, or it was a fluke. </p> <p>So what do the awards and rankings that adorn promotional literature for collective funds mean? </p> <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's Micropal star rankings, and the more demanding Standard &amp; Poor's Fund Research ratings, are both frequently cited in marketing efforts directed at private investors. Lipper ARC medals are aimed at professional managers, and the full list is currently only available to subscribers. However, they are often cited as a claim to fame, so investors need to know what they mean. </p> <p>All three sets of awards start with performance over the past three years. </p> <p>The Lipper ARC medals and Micropal rankings are based purely on these performance figures and are recalculated monthly. Micropal says star rankings are held, on average, for four months, so by the time you consider buying a fund, its rating may be about to change. The Fund Research ratings start by picking the top 38 per cent of funds in each sector on the basis of their performance over the past three years. If fund managers agree to pay \u00a31,500 or more per trust, extensive research is conducted to determine whether the fund should receive a rating. Around 20 per cent prove successful. </p> <p>Funds hold their Funds Research rating for one year. But quarterly qualitative checks are conducted, and if there is a dramatic change, such as a new manager, for example, the rating is put 'under review'. </p> <p>Only around 10 per cent of rated funds gain an AAA rating, the highest accolade, with the majority clustered in the AA sector. Some manage to hold their ranking for many years. Newton Income Fund, for instance, has retained its AAA rating for a decade. </p> <p>The Lipper ARC medals and Micropal rankings have several important differences. All funds receive a Micropal ranking, whereas funds must beat their benchmark to achieve a Lipper ARC medal. Normally fewer than 2 per cent gain a Lipper ARC platinum medal, whereas the top 10 per cent of funds invariably gain a five-star Micropal ranking. </p> <p>Micropal starts with a fund's average investment return relative to the rest of its sector in each of the last 36 months then divides it by the volatility of that outperformance (the amount by which it has varied from month to month) to arrive at a relative return/volatility ratio. The fund is ranked on the basis of this ratio. The funds in a sector could all be doing badly, but the top risk-adjusted performers would still get a top rating. </p> <p>Lipper compares funds against an index, which it selects on the basis of the funds' objectives and composition. Lipper claims this is more objective than comparison within a sector, which can have a bias to underperformance, and it contends that its method of measuring risk and consistency is more objective. </p> <p>Both methods assess risk-adjusted performance over discreet monthly periods. But whereas Micropal gives equal weighting to each month, Lipper gives greater weight to more recent results. </p> <p>Both use bid-to-bid figures for funds and Micropal uses mid price-to-mid price for investment trusts, which Lipper does not cover. 'Bid-to-bid takes into account the management fee, custodian charges, and all the other running costs,' says Lipper spokesperson Dale Hubber-Richard. </p> <p>While the Lipper ARC medals aim to reflect recent changes more rapidly than the Micropal star rankings, they remain purely quantitative and retrospective. Fund Research ratings, on the other hand, attempt to predict whether a fund can maintain past performance. Only 40 per cent of the rating score is quantitative. </p> <p>The qualitative screening is carried out by a team of analysts, many of whom are former fund managers. They assess the fund and score it on a spread of criteria mainly relating to the fund management group, portfolio manager and the team. The results are discussed by an analyst committee, sometimes after considerable debate. </p> <p>Because of the qualitative overlay, ratings can be com paratively stable and will not necessarily be affected by one year's poor performance. But they are likely to more swiftly reflect potentially important changes, such as a takeover of the management company, a shift in style or a big change in funds under management, particularly if these are associated with a loss of form.'We believe that managers who have a clear philosophy and continually implement it through a disciplined process are more likely to be able to replicate their results,' says Fund Research. </p> <p>Investors use past performance as a means to choose funds, but the Financial Services Authority seems determined to move the focus to hard facts such as costs. </p> <p>Anne McMeehan, spoke-sperson for the Association of Unit Trusts &amp; Investment Funds, believes this approach is misguided: 'I don't agree with the contention that past performance is eminently dismissible. The past can't tell you precisely what the future is, but it is highly relevant. </p> <p>If a fund has performed abysmally in the past there is usually a reason, which needs to be explored. The focus that consumerist types have, to look at costs alone, is not a good thing.' </p> <p>She added: 'Past performance incorporates all the costs.

A European Union report in the early Nineties said more than 1,000 French companies and 200 British ones (mostly estate agents) were involved in selling French homes to the British. </p> <p>French Property News, a magazine and advice service for prospective buyers, organises exhibitions for developers and estate agents selling French homes, and individuals wanting to buy - the next one is in Birmingham on 9-11 March. 'We had over 12,700 visitors to our last exhibition in January - a record for any event of this kind in Britain, we think,' says Dick Schrader, the magazine's managing director. </p> <p>'The interesting thing this year is that more people are looking to move to France permanently, not just for a holiday home. They're looking at the NHS, crime and transport, and saying that there must be somewhere better than the UK. Whether they're right or not is another matter, but there's a move in that direction. One of France's most appealing aspects is that it is large, and most British people who stay there for weekends or permanently want to become French in the way they live. </p> <p>So there isn't any 'Costa' mentality, with certain towns being identified with the British or the Germans - it's all just French. </p> <p>But the days of ultra-cheap French property are over - speculative purchasers from Britain, Germany and Holland have seen to that. But Gallic property is still outstandingly good value, and so far most regions have avoided becoming British enclaves. </p> <p>In the Loire a two-bedroom stone house with large outbuildings, overlooking the river in the village of Lange, with electricity, water and drainage all connected, is on the market for just \u00a327,000 through Dorset-based Agence Maison Ren\u00e9. Near Mayenne in Normandy you can find a seventeenth-century farmhouse with five acres of land and lots of outbuildings for around \u00a390,000 through agents Maison France. </p> <p>At the top of the market Knight Frank is offering Domaine de Ranguin, 11 kilometres from the Cannes Croisette. This seventeenth-century estate has eight bedrooms in the main house, two staff apartments, a guest cottage plus 44 acres of land - including olive grove. It is on sale for Ff35,000,000 (\u00a33.53m) - a lot less than a similar house in the UK, despite being in one of Europe's most desirable (and sunny) locations. </p> <p>Whatever your price range, there are six key steps every buyer should follow: </p> <p>\u0095 Get a British-based solicitor with French property experience to navigate the maze of European property law - some are listed on the internet, and any British estate agent selling French homes should be able to refer you. Some experts believe French solicitors (notaires) are less likely to point out shortcomings in a property deal because they usually work for both seller and buyer. </p> <p>\u0095 Organise how you will pay for your new home. Abbey National is the main UK lender for French purchases, followed by Barclays and the Woolwich. A broker will find the best deals. </p> <p>\u0095 Personally visit houses which are for sale. In rural France it is common to sell properties in a condition generally unacceptable in Britain, and pre-sale surveys are still rare. Local authority and utility searches will also be required, as in this country, to find out about future development proposals and rights of way. </p> <p>\u0095 Get your solicitor to check the proposed sale agreement. Signing an agreement in France can make you liable to pay some or all of the cost even if you later withdraw from the deal, so it is crucial to ensure the maximum information is contained in the contract at this stage. </p> <p>\u0095 Clarify whether your new home is subject to French inheritance tax, which favours children ahead of a spouse if the owner dies without a will. If this arrangement does not suit you, simply set out your wishes in a will. </p> <p>\u0095 Use a local French agency to manage your home if you wish to rent it out. It is expensive to make emergency trips from the UK to parts of France which can take 24 hours to reach - and many agency charges will be tax-deductible anyway. </p> <p>Enjoy your gite or apartment - but do not expect it to make you rich. British property inflation is unheard of in France, where owner-occupation rates (and, for that matter, interest rates) are lower than in the UK. French nationals can borrow only up to 80 per cent of a property's value, with a maximum loan-to-income ratio of around 1 to 2.5; in Britain it is up to 100 per cent, with a ratio of up to 3.5 or even more. Even in Paris it is rare to have property inflation over 3 per cent a year - so look on a French property as something to enjoy, and not mainly as an investment. </p> <p><strong>Contacts</strong></p> <p><strong>French Property News</strong> (020 8543 3113) </p> <p><strong>Agency Maison Ren\u00e9</strong> (023 9259 9409) </p> <p><strong>Maison France</strong> (01427 628537) </p> <p><strong>Knight Frank</strong> (020 7629 8171)</p>",

      "body": "<p>Moves in Scotland to offer free personal care to the elderly are unlikely to be mirrored south of the border, experts on long-term care say. </p> <p>Campaigners in the UK have been hoping that Westminster could be persuaded to follow the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care and provide free personal care as well as free nursing care for the elderly. </p> <p>This would mean that the costs of helping someone to get dressed and giving them a bath, for example, would be covered, as well as the nursing costs of dispensing medicine to them and giving them other medical treat ment. If a nursing home resident typically pays about \u00a3400 a week, they would continue to pay their own bed-and-board costs (perhaps \u00a3200 a week), but their nursing costs (perhaps \u00a360 to \u00a3100) and personal care costs (perhaps \u00a3120) would be met by the state. </p> <p>The hopes of campaigners were stimulated last month when the Scottish Parliament - after some wobbling by the ruling minority Labour group - agreed to offer free personal care. The bill could come into effect by early 2002. </p> <p>Another source of encouragement was the January announcement from the Liberal Democrats in Westminster that 'free personal care will be a central plank of the Liberal Democrats' health policy in the manifesto for the general election'. This move means that if the grey power lobby could organise itself it would have a flag to gather under.The Lib Dem candidate fighting Peter Mandelson's Hartlepool seat, for instance, has made it clear that long-term care will be one of his three main campaigning issues. </p> <p>More fuel could be added to the debate if the Northern Ireland Assembly decides - as it could - to follow the Scottish route.

      "bodyText": "Moves in Scotland to offer free personal care to the elderly are unlikely to be mirrored south of the border, experts on long-term care say. Campaigners in the UK have been hoping that Westminster could be persuaded to follow the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care and provide free personal care as well as free nursing care for the elderly. This would mean that the costs of helping someone to get dressed and giving them a bath, for example, would be covered, as well as the nursing costs of dispensing medicine to them and giving them other medical treat ment. If a nursing home resident typically pays about \u00a3400 a week, they would continue to pay their own bed-and-board costs (perhaps \u00a3200 a week), but their nursing costs (perhaps \u00a360 to \u00a3100) and personal care costs (perhaps \u00a3120) would be met by the state. The hopes of campaigners were stimulated last month when the Scottish Parliament - after some wobbling by the ruling minority Labour group - agreed to offer free personal care. The bill could come into effect by early 2002. Another source of encouragement was the January announcement from the Liberal Democrats in Westminster that 'free personal care will be a central plank of the Liberal Democrats' health policy in the manifesto for the general election'. This move means that if the grey power lobby could organise itself it would have a flag to gather under.The Lib Dem candidate fighting Peter Mandelson's Hartlepool seat, for instance, has made it clear that long-term care will be one of his three main campaigning issues. More fuel could be added to the debate if the Northern Ireland Assembly decides - as it could - to follow the Scottish route. 'We don't yet know what route they will take,' says Tom Cairns of Age Concern Northern Ireland. But the Northern Ireland Health Minister is currently studying both the English and Scottish proposals and will have to bring out her own plans.

      "body": "<p>You can buy a respectable paper print by Rembrandt at an auction for \u00a31,000. </p> <p>The seventeenth century Dutch master was probably the most accomplished print maker of all time. After nearly four centuries, many of these works are torn, holed, creased and stained, or patched up with filler like an old car. The big auction houses reject the majority, abetted by accountants who think selling lots at less than\u00a31,000 is bad business. </p> <p>Your \u00a31,000 buys a print with defects that are less than horrifying, and that price could double or triple in between 10 and 15 years. For the same amount, you could buy at auction a contemporary print by avant garde artists Gilbert and George, a toy Batman robot or a silk scarf worn by Elvis Presley. </p> <p> But do you really want a Rembrandt? Now is the time to find out. The finest of them are on show at the British Museum. The 200 being exhibited until 8 April are the cream of the world's two most comprehensive collections, the British Museum's own and that of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. </p> <p>Ask yourself whether the facial expressions of his portraits have a deep emotional appeal. Is there something sublime about the tonal contrasts of his landscapes? Do his low-life characters look modern? In short, does the exhibition convey a hint that the art of an Old Master might still have more lasting appeal than flashy contemporary art or memorabilia? </p> <p>Or are you more impressed by the fact that Rembrandt prints are disappearing from the market into museums, making those still available rarer and more valuable? And that Old Master exhibitions in Britain are pulling in record-breaking crowds? </p> <p>The next print auctions at Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips are not until June, so there is time for research before you enter a saleroom where three quarters of the bidders for Old Master prints are dealers with 20 or 30 years' experience. The dealers know each Rembrandt image like an old friend, but private buyers have an advantage over the trade. They do not need to sell their purchases for a profit, at least not in the short term. So when the dealers have bid as close to their resale price as they dare, a last-minute private bid can win. </p> <p>These auctions are more like second-hand car auctions than they appear. Demand for a print can be largely a matter of taste. Would you rather a low-mileage, one-owner Volk swagen or a clapped-out Rolls-Royce - a Rembrandt print that is a feeble impression but in tip-top condition, or a rich impression that has been damaged? The prices could differ by thousands of pounds, but who is to say which is the better buy? </p> <p>Two prints of Rembrandt's Raising of Lazarus (1642), virtually identical to the untrained eye, sold for widely differing prices - lot 94 fetched \u00a36,815 and lot 95 brought a mere \u00a3940 - at Christie's last December. </p> <p>I asked Richard Lloyd, head of Christie's Old Master, modern and contemporary print department, to explain. First, the cheaper lot, 95, with a pre-sale estimate of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500, has wider margins around the image. To a beginner, perhaps used to buying Victorian prints, it might look the more attractive. But in Rembrandt's day, when paper was very expensive, prints were routinely trimmed and the offcuts used for smaller prints. </p> <p>Experts do not regard the trimming of these prints as a defect, unless the plate mark (the ridge left by the edges of the plate), or the image itself, has been cut. </p> <p>One respected dealer, the late Martin Gordon, of Florida, irked by amateurs' preoccupation with trimming, jokingly proposed a selling exhibition of blank offcut margins, priced according to the reputation of the artist! The Lazarus in lot 94, whose estimated price was \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000, is one of the first prints that Rembrandt pulled from the plate before doing more work on it, while lot 95 is a print from the same plate in its final state. </p> <p>A beginner might assume that the final one is preferable as it is Rembrandt's final expression of his intentions. This is sometimes true, but the difference between the two states of The Raising of Lazarus is trivial: the addition of three fine lines behind Lazarus's head. Which makes the difference in price even more puzzling. Until the burr on Christ's right thumb is considered. </p> <p>The what? How arcane can you get? It is quite simple, really. The burr is the spikes of copper ploughed up by the artist's needle as he scores a line on the plate, a process known as drypoint. The spikes hold extra droplets of ink, which slowly seep into the paper, like blots, giving a velvety, watercolour-like effect which collectors prize. </p> <p>The Raising of Lazarus has touches of drypoint. The rest is etched - a different process in which the image is scratched on a wax-coated plate that is then plunged into acid, which bites into the exposed metal. Rembrandt frequently used both processes on the same plate. Plates wear with use. The burr of drypoint is delicate and has a much shorter lifespan than etched lines. </p> <p>Which is where Christ's right thumb comes in. It is accepted among connoisseurs that, in this print, the burr on His thumb was among the first touches of drypoint to wear away. In the first state of the print, the burr is intact. In the second state it has disappeared. So do you prefer the final state, which includes the master's final strokes, or the first state, with burr intact? </p> <p>The saleroom's verdict was made clear by different prices. But both were good buys. The impressions were catalogued by Christie's as 'very good' (the more expensive one) and 'good'. The more expensive one had an added advantage: a collector's mark giving known provenance. </p> <p>Condition counted; the less expensive one had repairs to spots of thin paper. Consult a paper conservationist if you fear that the print you want is badly damaged, or has defects that you cannot live with. They can wash out all but the most livid fox marks (brown spots of mould), and invisibly knit tears and smooth creases. Only loss of printed paper need genuinely worry you. </p> <p>Differing qualities of impression and condition meant that, at Christie's last June, two portraits by Rembrandt of Jan Lutma, the goldsmith (1656), both second states, sold for \u00a33,760 and \u00a32,115, while a third (final) state fetched only \u00a31,057. </p> <p>It is essential to learn how many states Rembrandt made of each print, and how they differ, so buy a few catalogues raisonn\u00e9s, scholarly works that list them all. Beginners will appreciate the American G.W. Nowell-Usticke's catalogue; although it classifies minor damage, such as accidental scratches, as distinct states, which is considered pedan tic, it does advise on rarity. The current British Museum exhibition has published a magnificent illustrated catalogue containing new research on Rembrandt's reworkings. It also contains details of catalogues raisonn\u00e9s; look in the bibliography for the authors Hollstein, Hind and the popular White &amp; Boon. </p> <p>Consult auction house specialists as well as the textbooks. They may have valuable tips that do not appear in the sale catalogue. </p> <p>You will, of course, have to avoid the pitfall of 'later' impressions, printed from Rembrandt's plates by others after his death in 1669. </p> <p>A Rembrandt print priced at less than \u00a31,000 is likely to be either damaged or a later impression. The exceptions prove that Rembrandt collectors really do go for quality - as proved by the occasional high auction price for a later impression. comparatively paltry \u00a33,290 at Christie's in June. </p> <p>Lloyd of Christie's advises: 'Decide how much you want to spend, then go for the finest print that your money will buy. And bear in mind that you need to invest not just money, but time.' </p> <p>\u0095 'Rembrandt the Printmaker' is published by British Museum Publications (2000) at \u00a350 (p&amp;p \u00a35 UK, \u00a37.50 abroad) (Tel: 0207 323 8492).

Ask yourself whether the facial expressions of his portraits have a deep emotional appeal. Is there something sublime about the tonal contrasts of his landscapes? Do his low-life characters look modern? In short, does the exhibition convey a hint that the art of an Old Master might still have more lasting appeal than flashy contemporary art or memorabilia? Or are you more impressed by the fact that Rembrandt prints are disappearing from the market into museums, making those still available rarer and more valuable? And that Old Master exhibitions in Britain are pulling in record-breaking crowds? The next print auctions at Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips are not until June, so there is time for research before you enter a saleroom where three quarters of the bidders for Old Master prints are dealers with 20 or 30 years' experience. The dealers know each Rembrandt image like an old friend, but private buyers have an advantage over the trade. They do not need to sell their purchases for a profit, at least not in the short term. So when the dealers have bid as close to their resale price as they dare, a last-minute private bid can win. These auctions are more like second-hand car auctions than they appear. Demand for a print can be largely a matter of taste. Would you rather a low-mileage, one-owner Volk swagen or a clapped-out Rolls-Royce - a Rembrandt print that is a feeble impression but in tip-top condition, or a rich impression that has been damaged? The prices could differ by thousands of pounds, but who is to say which is the better buy? Two prints of Rembrandt's Raising of Lazarus (1642), virtually identical to the untrained eye, sold for widely differing prices - lot 94 fetched \u00a36,815 and lot 95 brought a mere \u00a3940 - at Christie's last December. I asked Richard Lloyd, head of Christie's Old Master, modern and contemporary print department, to explain. First, the cheaper lot, 95, with a pre-sale estimate of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500, has wider margins around the image. To a beginner, perhaps used to buying Victorian prints, it might look the more attractive. But in Rembrandt's day, when paper was very expensive, prints were routinely trimmed and the offcuts used for smaller prints. Experts do not regard the trimming of these prints as a defect, unless the plate mark (the ridge left by the edges of the plate), or the image itself, has been cut. One respected dealer, the late Martin Gordon, of Florida, irked by amateurs' preoccupation with trimming, jokingly proposed a selling exhibition of blank offcut margins, priced according to the reputation of the artist! The Lazarus in lot 94, whose estimated price was \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000, is one of the first prints that Rembrandt pulled from the plate before doing more work on it, while lot 95 is a print from the same plate in its final state. A beginner might assume that the final one is preferable as it is Rembrandt's final expression of his intentions. This is sometimes true, but the difference between the two states of The Raising of Lazarus is trivial: the addition of three fine lines behind Lazarus's head. Which makes the difference in price even more puzzling. Until the burr on Christ's right thumb is considered. The what? How arcane can you get? It is quite simple, really. The burr is the spikes of copper ploughed up by the artist's needle as he scores a line on the plate, a process known as drypoint. The spikes hold extra droplets of ink, which slowly seep into the paper, like blots, giving a velvety, watercolour-like effect which collectors prize. The Raising of Lazarus has touches of drypoint. The rest is etched - a different process in which the image is scratched on a wax-coated plate that is then plunged into acid, which bites into the exposed metal. Rembrandt frequently used both processes on the same plate. Plates wear with use. The burr of drypoint is delicate and has a much shorter lifespan than etched lines. Which is where Christ's right thumb comes in. It is accepted among connoisseurs that, in this print, the burr on His thumb was among the first touches of drypoint to wear away. In the first state of the print, the burr is intact. In the second state it has disappeared. So do you prefer the final state, which includes the master's final strokes, or the first state, with burr intact? The saleroom's verdict was made clear by different prices. But both were good buys. The impressions were catalogued by Christie's as 'very good' (the more expensive one) and 'good'. The more expensive one had an added advantage: a collector's mark giving known provenance. Condition counted; the less expensive one had repairs to spots of thin paper. Consult a paper conservationist if you fear that the print you want is badly damaged, or has defects that you cannot live with. They can wash out all but the most livid fox marks (brown spots of mould), and invisibly knit tears and smooth creases. Only loss of printed paper need genuinely worry you. Differing qualities of impression and condition meant that, at Christie's last June, two portraits by Rembrandt of Jan Lutma, the goldsmith (1656), both second states, sold for \u00a33,760 and \u00a32,115, while a third (final) state fetched only \u00a31,057. It is essential to learn how many states Rembrandt made of each print, and how they differ, so buy a few catalogues raisonn\u00e9s, scholarly works that list them all. Beginners will appreciate the American G.W. Nowell-Usticke's catalogue; although it classifies minor damage, such as accidental scratches, as distinct states, which is considered pedan tic, it does advise on rarity. The current British Museum exhibition has published a magnificent illustrated catalogue containing new research on Rembrandt's reworkings. It also contains details of catalogues raisonn\u00e9s; look in the bibliography for the authors Hollstein, Hind and the popular White &amp; Boon. Consult auction house specialists as well as the textbooks. They may have valuable tips that do not appear in the sale catalogue. You will, of course, have to avoid the pitfall of 'later' impressions, printed from Rembrandt's plates by others after his death in 1669. A Rembrandt print priced at less than \u00a31,000 is likely to be either damaged or a later impression. The exceptions prove that Rembrandt collectors really do go for quality - as proved by the occasional high auction price for a later impression. comparatively paltry \u00a33,290 at Christie's in June. Lloyd of Christie's advises: 'Decide how much you want to spend, then go for the finest print that your money will buy. And bear in mind that you need to invest not just money, but time.' \u0095 'Rembrandt the Printmaker' is published by British Museum Publications (2000) at \u00a350 (p&amp;p \u00a35 UK, \u00a37.50 abroad) (Tel: 0207 323 8492).

Which is surprising given that Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and John Maynard Keynes have all been credited with describing it as the eighth wonder of the world. </p> <p>Take \u00a35,000 and invest it in equities for 30 years at a growth rate of 18 per cent. Reinvest the dividends. Do not withdraw any capital. How much will your pot have grown to - \u00a370,000, \u00a3150,000? The answer may surprise you: more than \u00a3700,000. That's compound interest. And the scenario is not beyond the realms of possibility: 18 per cent is the average growth rate of the UK stock market over the past 20 years. And though inflation and tax will reduce the real rate of return, even a growth rate of 10 per cent will see your original \u00a35,000 grow to over \u00a387,000 - a rate of return of more than 1,640 per cent. </p> <p>Tom Stevenson, co-author with Jim Slater of How To Become A Millionaire , talks of the magic of 'compound interest' and describes it as a powerful force over time. But if, as he says, it's not rocket science what is the secret? </p> <p>Interest on interest, says Neil Wright, a director in personal financial planning at PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Save a \u00a31,000 a year for 25 years, and grow your money by 10 per cent a year without withdrawing any capital. After one year your pot will have grown to \u00a31,100 - an increase of \u00a3100. After two years the increase will be \u00a3110, but after 25 years the final 10 per cent rise is worth \u00a3985 - nearly 10 times that in the first year. (See table.)After 25 years, because of compound interest, you end up with \u00a310,835. However, had you withdrawn your interest at the end of each year you would have only \u00a3,3,500 (your original \u00a31,000 plus 25 x \u00a3100). </p> <p>So how does the ordinary investor or saver take advantage of such an extraordinary phenomenon? </p> <p>The amount you end up with depends on how much you put in, the rate of return, and the number of years you keep the investments compounding. And as the absolute returns increase in the latter years, it is better to do so for as long as you can, says Tom Stevenson. But, he adds, there are other key factors. Taking out profits and interest will massively limit returns in the long run, especially if this is done in the early years. Ten per cent versus 13 per cent in one year isn't very much, but over 20-25 years it is significant. This is borne out by performance figures for UK unit trusts for the 10 years up to 18 December, says Neil Wright. For the basic- rate taxpayer, an investment of \u00a3100 in an average UK equity income would have grown to \u00a3347 had income been reinvested, but only \u00a3240 had the income been distributed. </p> <p>Taxation is another negative factor. The effect of capital gains tax on a higher rate taxpayer is to reduce capital growth from 15 per cent to 9 per cent, which clearly reduces the ability of compounding to work its magic. Taxation is a very big factor if investment is not in a tax-exempt wrapper, says Stevenson. One of the easiest and most accessible ways of sheltering your investment is by making use of your Isa allowances, he advises. </p> <p>Inflation is also a bugbear. Between 1959 and 1999 buying power reduced thirteen-fold, says Stevenson. What was \u00a31 million then is worth \u00a377,000 today, even though during most of that time the inflation rate was not enormous. Without compound interest on your side, maintaining the real value of savings is impossible, and the return on equity based investments is significantly reduced. </p> <p>Though compounding can transform relatively small investments and savings into significant sums, it has its downside. For people who owe money it works in reverse, but no less powerfully. Compound interest explains why debt will increase exponentially if left unchecked, and why anyone doubling the repayments on their credit card will pay it off in less than half the time originally planned. </p> <p>If that is still too much like rocket science, the rule of 72 demonstrates the power of compounding more easily. It tells you approximately how many years it takes for compound interest to double your money. Assuming a growth rate of 9 per cent a year \u00a310,000 will become \u00a320,000 in eight years (72/9). And after another eight years, it will have doubled again to \u00a340,000. </p> <p>Wright describes compound interest as a misunderstood concept (See example below.) Yet he says he has rarely if ever seen a client who understood the importance of whether interest is paid quarterly, six-monthly or annually. People look at the headline rate rather than the frequency, and as a result if it is paid less frequently they may be getting a worse rate than they thought, he says. </p> <p>Say you start off with \u00a31,000. Five per cent a year with interest paid quarterly means you get 1.25 per cent each quarter (5 per cent divided by 4 per cent). Multiply the \u00a31,000 by 1.0125 and you get \u00a31012.50. This is how much you will have after one quarter. Use this figure and multiply it by 1.0125. After 6 months you will have \u00a31025.16. Do this twice more and at the end of the year your \u00a31,000 will have grown to \u00a31050.95, an annual rate of return of 5.095. </p> <p>That's compound interest. Whether it is the eighth wonder of the world is questionable, but one thing is undeniable - if you let it, compound interest certainly grows on you.</p>",

And though inflation and tax will reduce the real rate of return, even a growth rate of 10 per cent will see your original \u00a35,000 grow to over \u00a387,000 - a rate of return of more than 1,640 per cent. Tom Stevenson, co-author with Jim Slater of How To Become A Millionaire , talks of the magic of 'compound interest' and describes it as a powerful force over time. But if, as he says, it's not rocket science what is the secret? Interest on interest, says Neil Wright, a director in personal financial planning at PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Save a \u00a31,000 a year for 25 years, and grow your money by 10 per cent a year without withdrawing any capital. After one year your pot will have grown to \u00a31,100 - an increase of \u00a3100. After two years the increase will be \u00a3110, but after 25 years the final 10 per cent rise is worth \u00a3985 - nearly 10 times that in the first year. (See table.)After 25 years, because of compound interest, you end up with \u00a310,835. However, had you withdrawn your interest at the end of each year you would have only \u00a3,3,500 (your original \u00a31,000 plus 25 x \u00a3100). So how does the ordinary investor or saver take advantage of such an extraordinary phenomenon? The amount you end up with depends on how much you put in, the rate of return, and the number of years you keep the investments compounding. And as the absolute returns increase in the latter years, it is better to do so for as long as you can, says Tom Stevenson. But, he adds, there are other key factors. Taking out profits and interest will massively limit returns in the long run, especially if this is done in the early years. Ten per cent versus 13 per cent in one year isn't very much, but over 20-25 years it is significant. This is borne out by performance figures for UK unit trusts for the 10 years up to 18 December, says Neil Wright. For the basic- rate taxpayer, an investment of \u00a3100 in an average UK equity income would have grown to \u00a3347 had income been reinvested, but only \u00a3240 had the income been distributed. Taxation is another negative factor. The effect of capital gains tax on a higher rate taxpayer is to reduce capital growth from 15 per cent to 9 per cent, which clearly reduces the ability of compounding to work its magic. Taxation is a very big factor if investment is not in a tax-exempt wrapper, says Stevenson. One of the easiest and most accessible ways of sheltering your investment is by making use of your Isa allowances, he advises. Inflation is also a bugbear. Between 1959 and 1999 buying power reduced thirteen-fold, says Stevenson. What was \u00a31 million then is worth \u00a377,000 today, even though during most of that time the inflation rate was not enormous. Without compound interest on your side, maintaining the real value of savings is impossible, and the return on equity based investments is significantly reduced. Though compounding can transform relatively small investments and savings into significant sums, it has its downside. For people who owe money it works in reverse, but no less powerfully. Compound interest explains why debt will increase exponentially if left unchecked, and why anyone doubling the repayments on their credit card will pay it off in less than half the time originally planned. If that is still too much like rocket science, the rule of 72 demonstrates the power of compounding more easily. It tells you approximately how many years it takes for compound interest to double your money. Assuming a growth rate of 9 per cent a year \u00a310,000 will become \u00a320,000 in eight years (72/9). And after another eight years, it will have doubled again to \u00a340,000. Wright describes compound interest as a misunderstood concept (See example below.) Yet he says he has rarely if ever seen a client who understood the importance of whether interest is paid quarterly, six-monthly or annually. People look at the headline rate rather than the frequency, and as a result if it is paid less frequently they may be getting a worse rate than they thought, he says. Say you start off with \u00a31,000. Five per cent a year with interest paid quarterly means you get 1.25 per cent each quarter (5 per cent divided by 4 per cent). Multiply the \u00a31,000 by 1.0125 and you get \u00a31012.50. This is how much you will have after one quarter. Use this figure and multiply it by 1.0125. After 6 months you will have \u00a31025.16. Do this twice more and at the end of the year your \u00a31,000 will have grown to \u00a31050.95, an annual rate of return of 5.095. That's compound interest. Whether it is the eighth wonder of the world is questionable, but one thing is undeniable - if you let it, compound interest certainly grows on you.",

      "body": "<p><strong> In the cradle</strong> </p> <p> You can now have a pension as soon as you are born. A doting relative can pay up to \u00a33,600 a year into one of the Government's new stakeholder plans. For a basic rate taxpayer this works out at an outlay of \u00a32,808 from April, after tax relief. It does not matter if the payment is made for someone who is not a taxpayer, but high-earning benefactors should note that they cannot claim the difference between basic rate tax and the higher rate, of 40 per cent. </p> <p>The money can be paid from savings rather than earnings, as it was under the old personal pension rules. Given the powerful effect compound interest (see feature page 13) can have on small investments held over a long period of time, this could provide a child with a good start towards a reasonable pension.</p> <p> <strong> In your twenties</strong> </p> <p> For most of us, this is the point when retirement planning should begin. </p> <p>Figures from insurer NPI show that a 25-year-old must put \u00a3233 a month, topped up to \u00a3299 by tax relief, into a stakeholder pension to achieve an income at 65 equivalent to \u00a315,000 a year now. A 40-year-old with no pension would have to spend \u00a3451, or \u00a3579 after relief. </p> <p>It is important for young women to build pensions of their own because of the way time off to bring up children can play havoc with income. Marriage breakdown later in life can stretch finances, and when you retire you discover that every pound saved could buy you 8 per cent less in income than a man (see 'in your sixties'). </p> <p>Twentysomethings seem acutely aware of the need to save for retirement, even though their spending may outstrip their commitment. A pension should not be the dominant financial aim if you have debts however. </p> <p>Jackie Holmes, of accountant PriceWaterhouse Coopers, says: 'Probably the priority needs to be to pay off debt, and you have to look at affordability. It is important to look at what other commitments you have, especially if you have a mortgage.' </p> <p>If your debts are under control, your priority should be an employer's scheme if it is available. 'It is a no-brainer that you should join it,' says Holmes. </p> <p>The company will contribute up to 10 per cent of your salary to the fund, while you will pay, perhaps, 5 per cent. Some employers have pensions that require no contribution by the employee - a particularly valuable benefit. </p> <p>If your employer has no scheme, the main option now is a personal pension, although from 6 April the new stakeholder pension will be available (for details see box). Employers without schemes of their own will be obliged to give access to stakeholder plans by October, and nominate a provider. But they won't have to pay into a stakeholder plan (see below). </p> <p>Many insurance companies are already offering personal pensions that mirror the stakeholder plans they will offer from April, so these are worth considering. </p> <p>But John Turton of adviser Best Pension says it may be worthwhile waiting to see what an employer offers, even if they do not contribute. </p> <p>'If an employer introduces a scheme charging 0.7 per cent against an outside stakeholder charging 0.9 per cent, little things like that matter,' Turton says. </p> <p>Don't forget that while a pension has good tax breaks - up to 40 per cent on contributions - you can also supplement pension savings with other forms of investments such as Individual Savings Accounts. If you delay starting a pension you should certainly still be setting aside long-term savings. </p> <p> <strong> In your thirties</strong> </p> <p> Act now if you want to have a pension equivalent to between half and two-thirds of your income. You may need to save more than 10 to 15 per cent of salary if you've done nothing so far. </p> <p>A rule of thumb used by pensions experts suggests that to work out what you should be saving for retirement, halve your age and invest the equivalent percentage of income in your pension. So by your late thirties, if you've done nothing so far you need to start with contributions of nearly 20 per cent. If you took out a personal pension five years ago, paying \u00a325 a month and have not increased contributions since you will almost certainly need to bump up contributions. </p> <p>If you're starting from scratch an employer's scheme should be the first thing to look at. If you want to catch up on saving not done in your twenties, and you have access to an employer's scheme, look at its Additional Voluntary Contribution plan. If the employer will pay into your AVC it's hard to argue against this form of saving. </p> <p>But you might also want to use a stakeholder pension. This is because the proceeds of AVC schemes must be used entirely to buy an annuity. Annuity rates are low and likely to remain so. A stakeholder scheme allows you to take 25 per cent of the maturity value as a cash lump sum which you might be able to invest for a higher return or use as you wish when you retire. </p> <p>Pension rules limit the amount you can contribute to a company scheme - including AVCs - to 15 per cent of your salary. But if you earn less than \u00a330,000 a year you can put another \u00a33,600 into a stakeholder plan. Another option is the free standing additional voluntary contribution scheme (Fsavc), a private version of the company AVC. </p> <p>Charges tend to be high and most people should consider their company scheme first and then a stakeholder. </p> <p>If you don't have access to an employer's scheme, look at a stakeholder or, possibly, a low-cost personal pension. </p> <p>If you want to save more than the rules allow, look first at other forms of saving with tax breaks, primarily Individual Savings Accounts where you can now contribute up to \u00a37,000 a year. Then try investments that don't carry tax breaks, such as unit trust or investment trust savings schemes. Remember, there is nothing magical about a pension; it is merely a wrapper around investments that will one day provide an income. </p> <p>If you took out a personal pension in your twenties you may be wondering whether to transfer your funds into a stakeholder plan, or to divert your monthly savings to one of the new schemes. Transfers can be expensive because of exit penalties. </p> <p>Even so, Best Pension adviser John Turton has just done a forecast for a client who stands to have his \u00a313,500 fund reduced by \u00a35,600 on transfer. </p> <p>'He will be 0.4 per cent better off he he jumps to stakeholder,' says Turton, who stresses that people usually need independent advice to work out whether a transfer is worthwhile. </p> <p>For older savers with schemes that had high initial charges, a switch is less likely to be worthwhile. Others will want more choice of investment funds than is likely to be available in stakeholder plans. </p> <p>Another issue is whether your personal pension firm plans to cut its charges to bring them in line with those of stakeholder plans. </p> <p>Even if you started a pension in your twenties, planning can become trickier and more time consuming if you have taken career breaks to bring up children. Broken income means that you may not be able to afford to contribute to a pension. </p> <p>Employers must continue to paying into occupational schemes for women on paid maternity leave. If you are receiving statutory maternity pay you will need to claim national insurance credits towards your state pension, though you should receive them automatically if are receiving maternity allowance. If you don't return to work, you should get automatic state pension credits after claiming child benefit for a year. </p> <p>Mothers who do not carry out paid work will be able to save in a stakeholder pension, or their partners can contribute for them. </p> <p>The thirties might be the time when you start a business, or become self-employed. You will then be on your own for pension provision. Stakeholder pen sions, or personal pensions are suitable for middle-income earners, but higher earners who like managing their investments might consider small self invested pension schemes (Sipps, see below), which allow you to choose your own, while contracting a specialist to do the administrative work. </p> <p>Until recently these schemes were viable only for pension savers putting away \u00a310,000 or more a year. But a new breed of internet-based Sipp providers is reducing costs and opening them to a wider audience. </p> <p>The pioneer was Sippdeal, which has a start-up fee of \u00a3100 and a minimum dealing charge of \u00a350. </p> <p> If you are running a small business you may want to consider a Small Self Administered Scheme, which will allow your firm to invest in its own property, or to set up a company scheme (if you're employing more than five people, remember that you have to offer a stakeholder plan), but this is an area for specialist advice. </p> <p> <strong> In your forties</strong> </p> <p> Retirement is coming closer, so it is time for more detailed planning. If you have done nothing about a pension yet, you will be shocked by the large amount you will now have to contribute. From a standing start, you may need to save between 20 and 25 per cent of income. Even if you have been saving steadily, this is the time to think about when you will want to retire and whether you need to top up your savings. You can obtain a forecast for your state pension by asking for form BR19 from Department of Social Security offices. </p> <p>Don't forget to ask about any entitlement to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps), the top-up state plan for employees. Contact past employers' schemes for forecasts of what these might produce. If you've lost track of a past scheme, contact the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (tel: 01273 627600) which operates a tracing service. </p> <p>If you need to top up an employer's scheme you can, as in your thirties, use an AVC, buy extra entitlement through 'added years' schemes or use a stakeholder pension. If you are making your own arrangements, make sure you are paying enough into your plan to keep you on track. However, if you are catching up and have little money to spare consider whether you can really afford to lock away savings that cannot be accessed until you retire. If you expect to have to finance children through university, for example or to fund an endowment shortfall and you are also under-pensioned you may need to save in an Isa or through unit trusts or investment trusts that allow you access to your cash at short notice. </p> <p>Don't forget that paying lump sums off a mortgage are a form of saving. Early repayment can save tens of thousands of pounds over the life of a mortgage, putting equity into a home that you might consider swapping for a smaller one when you retire. Another option might to buy property to rent out. </p> <p>Many middle aged divorced women, in particular are now facing up to the possibility of financial difficulty in retirement because they had no independent pension. The courts can now split pensions between divorcing partners, giving one a transfer value from the other's scheme to put into a pension of their own. Alternatively the courts can make an 'earmarking' order allowing one partner to collect a pension in retirement from the other's scheme. The splitting arrangement is likely to become more common than earmarking as it allows for a clean break. </p> <p>If you are in a stable, long-term relationship with a partner who has a good pension but you are not married, this may be the time to tie the knot. Some schemes do not automatically grant pensions to unmarried partners. </p> <p> <strong> In your fifties</strong> </p> <p> If you've saved steadily since your twenties, reviewed your pension regularly and knew you wanted to retire early, congratulations. You may now be able to cash in. </p> <p>If you are 50 and want to retire at 55, however, the sad truth is that you are unlikely to be able to afford it unless you have worked continuously for an employer with a top scheme, and it is prepared to pay you a handsome early retirement settlement. </p> <p>For many fiftysomethings, this will be a period of frantic catching-up, with retirement only years away. You need to review your pension forecasts (as for the forties, above) to see where you stand. A well funded personal pension may allow you to retire from 50 onwards. </p> <p>If any part of your pension depends on a 'money purchase' arrangement - which means it is invested in the stock market, rather than depending on your salary - you need to start looking at whether money should be transferred from high-risk to medium or low-risk investments. Most schemes prompt you over this, but check if you hear nothing. </p> <p>Start acquainting yourself with the finer points of annuities and their pitfalls. These provide annual income and are bought with the proceeds of money purchase pensions. A man of 65 retiring with a \u00a310,000 fund today would receive less than \u00a3900 a year, while a woman might get only \u00a3800 because she is likely to live longer and need more income. </p> <p>This does not provide for any form of inflation proofing or any repayment to your estate if you die within five years of taking the annuity.

      "bodyText": "In the cradle You can now have a pension as soon as you are born. A doting relative can pay up to \u00a33,600 a year into one of the Government's new stakeholder plans. For a basic rate taxpayer this works out at an outlay of \u00a32,808 from April, after tax relief. It does not matter if the payment is made for someone who is not a taxpayer, but high-earning benefactors should note that they cannot claim the difference between basic rate tax and the higher rate, of 40 per cent. The money can be paid from savings rather than earnings, as it was under the old personal pension rules. Given the powerful effect compound interest (see feature page 13) can have on small investments held over a long period of time, this could provide a child with a good start towards a reasonable pension. In your twenties For most of us, this is the point when retirement planning should begin. Figures from insurer NPI show that a 25-year-old must put \u00a3233 a month, topped up to \u00a3299 by tax relief, into a stakeholder pension to achieve an income at 65 equivalent to \u00a315,000 a year now. A 40-year-old with no pension would have to spend \u00a3451, or \u00a3579 after relief. It is important for young women to build pensions of their own because of the way time off to bring up children can play havoc with income. Marriage breakdown later in life can stretch finances, and when you retire you discover that every pound saved could buy you 8 per cent less in income than a man (see 'in your sixties'). Twentysomethings seem acutely aware of the need to save for retirement, even though their spending may outstrip their commitment. A pension should not be the dominant financial aim if you have debts however. Jackie Holmes, of accountant PriceWaterhouse Coopers, says: 'Probably the priority needs to be to pay off debt, and you have to look at affordability. It is important to look at what other commitments you have, especially if you have a mortgage.' If your debts are under control, your priority should be an employer's scheme if it is available. 'It is a no-brainer that you should join it,' says Holmes. The company will contribute up to 10 per cent of your salary to the fund, while you will pay, perhaps, 5 per cent. Some employers have pensions that require no contribution by the employee - a particularly valuable benefit. If your employer has no scheme, the main option now is a personal pension, although from 6 April the new stakeholder pension will be available (for details see box). Employers without schemes of their own will be obliged to give access to stakeholder plans by October, and nominate a provider. But they won't have to pay into a stakeholder plan (see below). Many insurance companies are already offering personal pensions that mirror the stakeholder plans they will offer from April, so these are worth considering. But John Turton of adviser Best Pension says it may be worthwhile waiting to see what an employer offers, even if they do not contribute. 'If an employer introduces a scheme charging 0.7 per cent against an outside stakeholder charging 0.9 per cent, little things like that matter,' Turton says. Don't forget that while a pension has good tax breaks - up to 40 per cent on contributions - you can also supplement pension savings with other forms of investments such as Individual Savings Accounts. If you delay starting a pension you should certainly still be setting aside long-term savings. In your thirties Act now if you want to have a pension equivalent to between half and two-thirds of your income. You may need to save more than 10 to 15 per cent of salary if you've done nothing so far. A rule of thumb used by pensions experts suggests that to work out what you should be saving for retirement, halve your age and invest the equivalent percentage of income in your pension. So by your late thirties, if you've done nothing so far you need to start with contributions of nearly 20 per cent. If you took out a personal pension five years ago, paying \u00a325 a month and have not increased contributions since you will almost certainly need to bump up contributions. If you're starting from scratch an employer's scheme should be the first thing to look at. If you want to catch up on saving not done in your twenties, and you have access to an employer's scheme, look at its Additional Voluntary Contribution plan. If the employer will pay into your AVC it's hard to argue against this form of saving. But you might also want to use a stakeholder pension. This is because the proceeds of AVC schemes must be used entirely to buy an annuity. Annuity rates are low and likely to remain so. A stakeholder scheme allows you to take 25 per cent of the maturity value as a cash lump sum which you might be able to invest for a higher return or use as you wish when you retire. Pension rules limit the amount you can contribute to a company scheme - including AVCs - to 15 per cent of your salary. But if you earn less than \u00a330,000 a year you can put another \u00a33,600 into a stakeholder plan. Another option is the free standing additional voluntary contribution scheme (Fsavc), a private version of the company AVC. Charges tend to be high and most people should consider their company scheme first and then a stakeholder. If you don't have access to an employer's scheme, look at a stakeholder or, possibly, a low-cost personal pension. If you want to save more than the rules allow, look first at other forms of saving with tax breaks, primarily Individual Savings Accounts where you can now contribute up to \u00a37,000 a year. Then try investments that don't carry tax breaks, such as unit trust or investment trust savings schemes. Remember, there is nothing magical about a pension; it is merely a wrapper around investments that will one day provide an income. If you took out a personal pension in your twenties you may be wondering whether to transfer your funds into a stakeholder plan, or to divert your monthly savings to one of the new schemes. Transfers can be expensive because of exit penalties. Even so, Best Pension adviser John Turton has just done a forecast for a client who stands to have his \u00a313,500 fund reduced by \u00a35,600 on transfer. 'He will be 0.4 per cent better off he he jumps to stakeholder,' says Turton, who stresses that people usually need independent advice to work out whether a transfer is worthwhile. For older savers with schemes that had high initial charges, a switch is less likely to be worthwhile. Others will want more choice of investment funds than is likely to be available in stakeholder plans. Another issue is whether your personal pension firm plans to cut its charges to bring them in line with those of stakeholder plans. Even if you started a pension in your twenties, planning can become trickier and more time consuming if you have taken career breaks to bring up children. Broken income means that you may not be able to afford to contribute to a pension. Employers must continue to paying into occupational schemes for women on paid maternity leave. If you are receiving statutory maternity pay you will need to claim national insurance credits towards your state pension, though you should receive them automatically if are receiving maternity allowance. If you don't return to work, you should get automatic state pension credits after claiming child benefit for a year. Mothers who do not carry out paid work will be able to save in a stakeholder pension, or their partners can contribute for them. The thirties might be the time when you start a business, or become self-employed. You will then be on your own for pension provision. Stakeholder pen sions, or personal pensions are suitable for middle-income earners, but higher earners who like managing their investments might consider small self invested pension schemes (Sipps, see below), which allow you to choose your own, while contracting a specialist to do the administrative work. Until recently these schemes were viable only for pension savers putting away \u00a310,000 or more a year. But a new breed of internet-based Sipp providers is reducing costs and opening them to a wider audience. The pioneer was Sippdeal, which has a start-up fee of \u00a3100 and a minimum dealing charge of \u00a350. If you are running a small business you may want to consider a Small Self Administered Scheme, which will allow your firm to invest in its own property, or to set up a company scheme (if you're employing more than five people, remember that you have to offer a stakeholder plan), but this is an area for specialist advice. In your forties Retirement is coming closer, so it is time for more detailed planning. If you have done nothing about a pension yet, you will be shocked by the large amount you will now have to contribute. From a standing start, you may need to save between 20 and 25 per cent of income. Even if you have been saving steadily, this is the time to think about when you will want to retire and whether you need to top up your savings. You can obtain a forecast for your state pension by asking for form BR19 from Department of Social Security offices. Don't forget to ask about any entitlement to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps), the top-up state plan for employees. Contact past employers' schemes for forecasts of what these might produce. If you've lost track of a past scheme, contact the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (tel: 01273 627600) which operates a tracing service. If you need to top up an employer's scheme you can, as in your thirties, use an AVC, buy extra entitlement through 'added years' schemes or use a stakeholder pension. If you are making your own arrangements, make sure you are paying enough into your plan to keep you on track. However, if you are catching up and have little money to spare consider whether you can really afford to lock away savings that cannot be accessed until you retire. If you expect to have to finance children through university, for example or to fund an endowment shortfall and you are also under-pensioned you may need to save in an Isa or through unit trusts or investment trusts that allow you access to your cash at short notice. Don't forget that paying lump sums off a mortgage are a form of saving. Early repayment can save tens of thousands of pounds over the life of a mortgage, putting equity into a home that you might consider swapping for a smaller one when you retire. Another option might to buy property to rent out. Many middle aged divorced women, in particular are now facing up to the possibility of financial difficulty in retirement because they had no independent pension. The courts can now split pensions between divorcing partners, giving one a transfer value from the other's scheme to put into a pension of their own. Alternatively the courts can make an 'earmarking' order allowing one partner to collect a pension in retirement from the other's scheme. The splitting arrangement is likely to become more common than earmarking as it allows for a clean break. If you are in a stable, long-term relationship with a partner who has a good pension but you are not married, this may be the time to tie the knot. Some schemes do not automatically grant pensions to unmarried partners. In your fifties If you've saved steadily since your twenties, reviewed your pension regularly and knew you wanted to retire early, congratulations. You may now be able to cash in. If you are 50 and want to retire at 55, however, the sad truth is that you are unlikely to be able to afford it unless you have worked continuously for an employer with a top scheme, and it is prepared to pay you a handsome early retirement settlement. For many fiftysomethings, this will be a period of frantic catching-up, with retirement only years away. You need to review your pension forecasts (as for the forties, above) to see where you stand. A well funded personal pension may allow you to retire from 50 onwards. If any part of your pension depends on a 'money purchase' arrangement - which means it is invested in the stock market, rather than depending on your salary - you need to start looking at whether money should be transferred from high-risk to medium or low-risk investments. Most schemes prompt you over this, but check if you hear nothing. Start acquainting yourself with the finer points of annuities and their pitfalls. These provide annual income and are bought with the proceeds of money purchase pensions. A man of 65 retiring with a \u00a310,000 fund today would receive less than \u00a3900 a year, while a woman might get only \u00a3800 because she is likely to live longer and need more income. This does not provide for any form of inflation proofing or any repayment to your estate if you die within five years of taking the annuity. These guarantees would mean an even lower income. If you are still topping up your pension you may need to weigh up the tax breaks on AVC contributions against the flexibility of investment outside pensions. If you are saving in AVCs you may want to consider diverting that money to something more flexible that does not require annuity purchase, but remember that returns from most forms of investment are likely to be in single figures, unless you take a big risk with your money. In your sixties If you haven't yet retired, look at whether any of your pension fund is invested in high risk funds. If you have money in AVCs or other 'money purchase' plans you need to start looking seriously at annuities. Peter Quinton of specialist adviser the Annuity Bureau believes that as many as 50 per cent of buyers go to the company that managed their pension funds when they might raise their retirement income by at least 10 per cent per cent by shopping around. Women reaching retirement will quickly discover that they do significantly worse out of annuities than men because of their longer lives. A woman of 60 retiring with a \u00a3100,000 pension fund could expect less than \u00a37,500 a year from one of the best annuities, against \u00a38,029 for a man. Another option is to consider a with profit annuity, where the income depends on bonus. Returns on these now compare favourably with those from conventional annuities, although they may not always give a higher return when you first retire. The hope is that income may rise, rather than remain static and at low levels as with a conventional annuity. The disadvantage is that your annual income is not guaranteed because returns on with profits funds vary from year to year. For people with large funds, the main alternative to an annuity is an income drawdown plan, or a phased retirement scheme. Both of these schemes involve leaving your pension fund invested to continue to growand drawing an income meanwhile, or taking sections of the fund to convert to annuities gradually. You must convert pension funds to an annuity by the time you are 75. The Income Drawdown Advisory Bureau, a specialist adviser, usually recommends this only for investors with funds of at least \u00a3250,000. Turton at Best Pension says another option for people who have non-pension investments they can live on is to leave the pension invested, and convert it into an annuity later.",

      "body": "<p>Most of us think we will be better of when we retire than we really will, according to recent research, and our expectations have become less realistic in recent years. </p> <p>The study by Barclays Bank last year looked at how well our pensions are measuring up against what we must save to achieve a comfortable retirement income. In 1996, the average 40 year old intending to retire at 65 on a pension of two thirds salary should have saved \u00a3164 a month in a private pension, but was actually contributing only \u00a3100. By 2000, the same person should have paid in \u00a3226 a month, but was saving only \u00a3138. So there was a 37.5 per cent rise in what the bank calls the 'misery gap'. </p> <p>The contribution needed from a private pension goes up every year because UK state pensions are falling in comparison with average earnings. The basic pension has risen in line with prices rather than earnings since the early Eighties, when the Thatcher government scaled back state provision. The effect was gradual, but two decades on pensioners are feeling the pinch. </p> <p>Many adults still think the state will provide for them. Forty-three per cent of those in the Barclays survey expected their living standards in retirement to be better than at work. A third had no private pension. </p> <p>Of those that did have private cover, 45 per cent saved less than \u00a350 a month. A little over a fifth put in less than \u00a325 a month and 27 per cent were saving, but had no idea how much. </p> <p>Yet nearly 80 per cent of those questioned wanted to go on at least one holiday abroad every year in their old age. Two thirds expected to be able to afford to eat out and make regular trips to the theatre or cinema. </p> <p>The reality for people already living on pensions was very different, Barclays found. Forty per cent of them were living on less than \u00a310,000 a year, while 57 per cent wished they had planned better. </p> <p>Barclays, of course, wants to sell pensions. But the charity Age Concern has no doubt that life for many pensioners is a struggle. It points to Government statistics showing that the median income of single pensioners after housing costs two years ago was \u00a388 a week , or \u00a34,576 a year, and \u00a3195 a week (\u00a310,140 a year) for couples. This compared with average full-time earnings of \u00a3384.50 a week (\u00a319,994 a year). </p> <p>Elderly people have begun to get militant about the state pension - a 75p increase in the basic state pension last April angered many of them - and the Government has begun to feel uncomfortable about their clout as voters. </p> <p>In April there will be an above-inflation \u00a35 rise in the basic pension for single people, to \u00a372.50 a week, and \u00a3115.90 for couples. But the Government refuses to restore the link between pensions and average pay. </p> <p>Age Concern says if the basic state pension had kept pace with average earnings a single pensioner would be looking forward to a weekly income of \u00a3101.15 from April, while couples would be getting \u00a3161.70. </p> <p>Instead, the Government is putting more emphasis on means testing. Its 'minimum income guarantee' ensures \u00a392.15 a week for single people from April and \u00a3140.55 for couples. But the gap between the basic pension and the minimum guarantee is made up of income support, a means-tested benefit based on a person's own income and savings. This is not given automatically, and around 700,000 pensioners who are entitled to it do not receive it. </p> <p>Means testing can penalise people who have saved enough to disqualify them from a state top-up, but not enough to make them significantly better off. The Government is working on a plan to remedy this, to be called the 'pensioners' credit'. This will give credits for savings up to a certain level, but the mechanics are complex. It is also introducing the low-cost stakeholder pension, making it cheaper and easier to save for retirement (see below). </p> <p>Age Concern asks whether it is worth people on low incomes saving for retirement if this just disqualifies them from state help. </p> <p>Rhian Beynon, an official of the charity, says: 'Ideally everyone should be saving for the future but it may be that you will save and still end up on income support. </p> <p>'The issue is whether they want to be dependent on means testing. One reason people may want to save for the future is that they will extricate themselves from that.' So what does it take to comfortably avoid means testing? </p> <p>Most pensions experts suggest aiming for a retirement income of at least half, and preferably two thirds, of what you will be earning when you retire. Jackie Holmes, senior manager of personal financial planning at accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers, explains: 'If you take public sector pension schemes as a blueprint, after 40 years you are looking for a 50 per cent pension and a lump sum of one and a half times pay at retirement.' </p> <p>Private sector pension schemes aim to provide two-thirds of a member's final salary and a smaller lump sum. To achieve this you need to save about 10 to 15 per cent of your income, including employers' contributions - for your entire working life. If you start late, the saving required increases dramatically. </p> <p>The antics of the pensions industry will have knocked many people's faith in this form of saving. The mis-selling scandal, where salesmen persuaded millions to cash in good employers' schemes to buy poorer-value personal pensions, seemed to make a nonsense of the message that saving for retirement was always worthwhile. Confidence in occupational pensions was knocked by the Maxwell scandal and recently the crisis at Equitable Life, one of the top names in the business, has raised questions about entrusting one's savings to large institutions in a country where regulation seems regularly to fail small investors. </p> <p>Yet pensions are not the only way to save for old age.

      "bodyText": "Most of us think we will be better of when we retire than we really will, according to recent research, and our expectations have become less realistic in recent years. The study by Barclays Bank last year looked at how well our pensions are measuring up against what we must save to achieve a comfortable retirement income. In 1996, the average 40 year old intending to retire at 65 on a pension of two thirds salary should have saved \u00a3164 a month in a private pension, but was actually contributing only \u00a3100. By 2000, the same person should have paid in \u00a3226 a month, but was saving only \u00a3138. So there was a 37.5 per cent rise in what the bank calls the 'misery gap'. The contribution needed from a private pension goes up every year because UK state pensions are falling in comparison with average earnings. The basic pension has risen in line with prices rather than earnings since the early Eighties, when the Thatcher government scaled back state provision. The effect was gradual, but two decades on pensioners are feeling the pinch. Many adults still think the state will provide for them. Forty-three per cent of those in the Barclays survey expected their living standards in retirement to be better than at work. A third had no private pension. Of those that did have private cover, 45 per cent saved less than \u00a350 a month. A little over a fifth put in less than \u00a325 a month and 27 per cent were saving, but had no idea how much. Yet nearly 80 per cent of those questioned wanted to go on at least one holiday abroad every year in their old age. Two thirds expected to be able to afford to eat out and make regular trips to the theatre or cinema. The reality for people already living on pensions was very different, Barclays found. Forty per cent of them were living on less than \u00a310,000 a year, while 57 per cent wished they had planned better. Barclays, of course, wants to sell pensions. But the charity Age Concern has no doubt that life for many pensioners is a struggle. It points to Government statistics showing that the median income of single pensioners after housing costs two years ago was \u00a388 a week , or \u00a34,576 a year, and \u00a3195 a week (\u00a310,140 a year) for couples. This compared with average full-time earnings of \u00a3384.50 a week (\u00a319,994 a year). Elderly people have begun to get militant about the state pension - a 75p increase in the basic state pension last April angered many of them - and the Government has begun to feel uncomfortable about their clout as voters. In April there will be an above-inflation \u00a35 rise in the basic pension for single people, to \u00a372.50 a week, and \u00a3115.90 for couples. But the Government refuses to restore the link between pensions and average pay. Age Concern says if the basic state pension had kept pace with average earnings a single pensioner would be looking forward to a weekly income of \u00a3101.15 from April, while couples would be getting \u00a3161.70. Instead, the Government is putting more emphasis on means testing. Its 'minimum income guarantee' ensures \u00a392.15 a week for single people from April and \u00a3140.55 for couples. But the gap between the basic pension and the minimum guarantee is made up of income support, a means-tested benefit based on a person's own income and savings. This is not given automatically, and around 700,000 pensioners who are entitled to it do not receive it. Means testing can penalise people who have saved enough to disqualify them from a state top-up, but not enough to make them significantly better off. The Government is working on a plan to remedy this, to be called the 'pensioners' credit'. This will give credits for savings up to a certain level, but the mechanics are complex. It is also introducing the low-cost stakeholder pension, making it cheaper and easier to save for retirement (see below). Age Concern asks whether it is worth people on low incomes saving for retirement if this just disqualifies them from state help. Rhian Beynon, an official of the charity, says: 'Ideally everyone should be saving for the future but it may be that you will save and still end up on income support. 'The issue is whether they want to be dependent on means testing. One reason people may want to save for the future is that they will extricate themselves from that.' So what does it take to comfortably avoid means testing? Most pensions experts suggest aiming for a retirement income of at least half, and preferably two thirds, of what you will be earning when you retire. Jackie Holmes, senior manager of personal financial planning at accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers, explains: 'If you take public sector pension schemes as a blueprint, after 40 years you are looking for a 50 per cent pension and a lump sum of one and a half times pay at retirement.' Private sector pension schemes aim to provide two-thirds of a member's final salary and a smaller lump sum. To achieve this you need to save about 10 to 15 per cent of your income, including employers' contributions - for your entire working life. If you start late, the saving required increases dramatically. The antics of the pensions industry will have knocked many people's faith in this form of saving. The mis-selling scandal, where salesmen persuaded millions to cash in good employers' schemes to buy poorer-value personal pensions, seemed to make a nonsense of the message that saving for retirement was always worthwhile. Confidence in occupational pensions was knocked by the Maxwell scandal and recently the crisis at Equitable Life, one of the top names in the business, has raised questions about entrusting one's savings to large institutions in a country where regulation seems regularly to fail small investors. Yet pensions are not the only way to save for old age. They are increasingly seen as inflex ible. Contributions to them benefit from tax relief, but the proceeds of Isa saving plans are tax-free. The boom in buy-to-let homes shows that many people see property as a ticket to a pension. Another option is to retire to a country with lower living costs. Increasingly, the notion of retirement as leaving the workforce altogether is being questioned. If the demographers are correct, a shortage of young labour will soon force employers to rely on older workers - a trend likely to be helped by the new Government proposal to end the formal retirement age. If you are determined not to work past a certain point, though, the only answer is to save - and save consistently. Pension schemes unscrambled Basic state scheme Paid for by National Insurance at full amount if you have a full NI record. Will be \u00a372.50 a week for a single person from April, \u00a3115.90 for a couple. Minimum income guarantee Means-tested top-up for low-income pensioners: \u00a392.15 for singles from April and \u00a3140.55 for couples.

      "body": "<p>The first time anyone knew something was wrong was when Lorraine Kelly felt a lump on her husband Paul's stomach. She persuaded him to see a doctor. The diagnosis was cancer.</p> <p>Three years later he died, aged 47, and now his brother, Peter Kelly, is going to the High Court for answers. He also wants to know why his daughter, Sarah, developed cancer when she was eight.</p> <p>He believes the cause of his family's tragedy lies just yards from his home where the nuclear submarines dock at Plymouth's Devonport naval base. Paul had worked for months as a roofer in the site, sometimes carrying out projects within the submarine compound. Sarah grew up in its shadow, in one of the tightly packed streets that nestle right up to the docks.</p> <p>'I don't want anything else to happen to my family,' Peter Kelly said. 'I want to know if we are safe or not.'</p> <p>Kelly has launched a legal fight to have a public hearing held into the environmental risks of the work that goes on at Devonport's nuclear dock and a plan to increase radioactive discharges.His case is expected to be heard within the next three months.</p> <p>DML, a company that is going to refit the Trident nuclear submarines, wants to boost the amount of tritium released into the River Tamar by 700 per cent and into the atmosphere as steam by 500 per cent.</p> <p>Tritium is radioactive water used as a coolant in submarines' reactors. DML has also applied for permission to emit radioactive carbon-14 and argon-41.</p> <p>Company officials insist their plans are safe and that levels of radiation would be indistinguishable from natural background radiation. 'We take our environmental and public health responsibilities very seriously indeed,' a DML spokesman said.</p> <p>But some scientists have concerns. Tritium's radiation passes easily into the human body because it is carried by water molecules. Also known as 'heavy water', it was used in the Seventies to make luminous exit signs and phone dials, but was banned because it was thought to be too dangerous. Tritium radiation fixes firmly to chemicals in human cells, including DNA, by a process called organic bonding. This can then disrupt a cell when it replicates, leading to mutations, which in turn can lead to cancer.</p> <p>With a half-life of 12 years, tritium could build up in the Tamar estuary and eventually enter the human food chain. Most of the tritium released at Devonport is piped directly into the river in an area rich in wrecks and sealife and popular with diving clubs.</p> <p>Another possible concern is tritium fog, condensing from effluent released by the docks into the air. Tritium has a higher freezing point than water and so could condense into a fine mist indistinguishable from normal fog.</p> <p>Concerns about the possible risks for pregnant women, whose foetuses may be vulnerable to tritium radiation, were raised by Dr Ian Fairlie, a radiation biologist who works as an independent consultant. 'I would advise all pregnant women not to be near the docks when the emissions are taking place. I don't think that is an unreasonable request at all.'</p> <p>DML, however, insists the risks are small. Tritium can be produced naturally from cosmic rays reacting with the atmosphere. DML also says its proposed emissions are within government safety guidelines.

      "bodyText": "The first time anyone knew something was wrong was when Lorraine Kelly felt a lump on her husband Paul's stomach. She persuaded him to see a doctor. The diagnosis was cancer. Three years later he died, aged 47, and now his brother, Peter Kelly, is going to the High Court for answers. He also wants to know why his daughter, Sarah, developed cancer when she was eight. He believes the cause of his family's tragedy lies just yards from his home where the nuclear submarines dock at Plymouth's Devonport naval base. Paul had worked for months as a roofer in the site, sometimes carrying out projects within the submarine compound. Sarah grew up in its shadow, in one of the tightly packed streets that nestle right up to the docks. 'I don't want anything else to happen to my family,' Peter Kelly said. 'I want to know if we are safe or not.' Kelly has launched a legal fight to have a public hearing held into the environmental risks of the work that goes on at Devonport's nuclear dock and a plan to increase radioactive discharges.His case is expected to be heard within the next three months. DML, a company that is going to refit the Trident nuclear submarines, wants to boost the amount of tritium released into the River Tamar by 700 per cent and into the atmosphere as steam by 500 per cent. Tritium is radioactive water used as a coolant in submarines' reactors. DML has also applied for permission to emit radioactive carbon-14 and argon-41. Company officials insist their plans are safe and that levels of radiation would be indistinguishable from natural background radiation. 'We take our environmental and public health responsibilities very seriously indeed,' a DML spokesman said. But some scientists have concerns. Tritium's radiation passes easily into the human body because it is carried by water molecules. Also known as 'heavy water', it was used in the Seventies to make luminous exit signs and phone dials, but was banned because it was thought to be too dangerous. Tritium radiation fixes firmly to chemicals in human cells, including DNA, by a process called organic bonding. This can then disrupt a cell when it replicates, leading to mutations, which in turn can lead to cancer. With a half-life of 12 years, tritium could build up in the Tamar estuary and eventually enter the human food chain. Most of the tritium released at Devonport is piped directly into the river in an area rich in wrecks and sealife and popular with diving clubs. Another possible concern is tritium fog, condensing from effluent released by the docks into the air. Tritium has a higher freezing point than water and so could condense into a fine mist indistinguishable from normal fog. Concerns about the possible risks for pregnant women, whose foetuses may be vulnerable to tritium radiation, were raised by Dr Ian Fairlie, a radiation biologist who works as an independent consultant. 'I would advise all pregnant women not to be near the docks when the emissions are taking place. I don't think that is an unreasonable request at all.' DML, however, insists the risks are small. Tritium can be produced naturally from cosmic rays reacting with the atmosphere. DML also says its proposed emissions are within government safety guidelines. 'We are being as careful as we can,' a spokesman said. But critics point out it was only two years ago that DML discovered it had unknowingly been producing radioactive carbon-14 as a waste prod uct. Carbon-14 can be dangerous if ingested. DML's parent company, Brown and Root, paid $750 million after being sued for mismanaging a nuclear construction project in Texas. Residents and environmentalists are concerned that Plymouth is becoming a nuclear dumping ground for the whole country. As well as becoming the sole British yard for refitting Trident submarines, Devonport is also to become a future site for storing up to 26 nuclear reactors from submarines going out of service. The council has put an emergency radiation leak plan on its website which reads like a throwback to the Cold War. It advises people to stay indoors and take iodine tablets to thwart the effects of radiation. A special plan, called DevPubSafe, has been developed for those living in and around the docks. The local primary school nearest the naval base, Barne Barton, has an annual nuclear emergency drill. Certainly Sarah Kelly, now aged 20, is afraid. After five years of chemotherapy her thyroid cancer went into remission, though she still has to have annual checks. She is concerned for her young son, Harry, born on the day Paul Kelly died.

      "body": "<p>Graham Thorpe is the man,' wrote Arjuna Ranatunga in these pages last week before rather tempering the compliment by adding: 'What can I say, the man plays like me.' Nasser Hussain has been even more generous. 'Thorpe is the key man for us again on this trip,' he said. 'Muralitharan does not do as well against left-handers as right-handers and we are hoping Graham can capitalise on that.' </p> <p>Thorpe is now the middle-order mainstay of the England batting line-up. He is the man who can build on a good start, who can help England, perhaps more than any other batsman, to a formidable total; the man who can keep his head down when all about him are losing their wickets. When England were dismissed for 46 in Trinidad in 1994 it was Thorpe who batted for an hour and half to make a gritty three. He is adept against pace and flourishes against spin. It is this last quality that will be crucial in the Test series against Sri Lanka, starting this week, and in the Ashes contest in the summer. </p> <p>Given their current run, it is hard to believe that the last time Australia visited England, they found themselves one-nil down after the second Test. In the first, they were bowled out by Caddick (5-50) and Gough (3-43) before Hussain (207) and Thorpe (138) put on 288 and batted England to victory. In the next, Hussain and Thorpe were again the top scorers, but this time with 19 and 21, and the rain saved England. Thereafter it was less a contest than an embarrassment as England stumbled from innings defeat to innings defeat and ended up selecting both the Hollioakes. </p> <p>Things can only get better, but don't expect Thorpe to become carried away. 'Ideally, this summer we want to be competitive against Australia. I haven't played in a series against them where it's been tooth and nail. And last time they were here even though we went 1-0 up they just went into another gear. </p> <p>The Aussies have set the benchmark. They are miles ahead. Miles ahead.' Not very gung-ho, no echoes of Tony Greig's 'We'll make them grovel' there, but it can't be a coincidence that since those in charge of English cricket started talking small they have exceeded expectations rather than depressed them. Ever since those in charge of the game admitted England were not very good - a no-brainer of a confession after you've lost, by a fair way, at home to New Zealand - the team have been playing half-decent cricket.</p> <p>This new approach is evident as Thorpe talks you through the recent tour of Pakistan, where England were expected, at best, what with Saqlain and the other spinners and the fact we couldn't play spin, to nick a couple of draws. 'We hung on to the reins for the first two Test matches,' says Thorpe. 'In Lahore we made it safe and in Faisalabad it was a matter of staying in there. Then when it came to the crunch we were able to put our foot down.' </p> <p>Traditionally - recent tradition, anyway - when it comes to the crunch, English cricket crumbles. This time they accelerated. Albeit very carefully. 'Going into the last day most of us thought it could and probably should be a draw. Then Nasser and Fletch [coach Duncan Fletcher] and I came together in the physio's room at lunch to work out a strategy for what might happen. If the target was five an over we would have sent in the main hitters. Alec [Stewart] would have opened, Craig White would have gone in at three and Hicky at four and I was going to come down to six or seven. But as it was four an over we stuck with the normal batting line-up and I was going to be held back in case we had to play for a draw.' </p> <p>With the benefit of hindsight and ignoring recent English cricket history, I interrupt to suggest this was a bit negative. 'It can happen,' says Thorpe. 'I've seen it fall apart very quickly. And if they'd picked up four or five wickets with 20 overs to go and everyone's round the bat... ' Enough said. 'We didn't want to be too reckless. And I wasn't even going to bat and didn't have my pads on and then the leggy came on, which was good for me what with the rough, and Naz said, \"Get your pads on\".' And Thorpe went out and achieved exactly what he had envisaged achieving earlier in the day. 'While I was fielding I was thinking what a great game this would be to win. What a great time to get 50 not out and win.' He reached 50 but he was still not confident of the win. </p> <p>'The last four or five overs were worrying. We were so close when Hicky got out and I was concerned when Naz came in and I asked Steve Bucknor if he would offer the light to the fielding side and he said he wouldn't.' </p> <p>Would he have done so if there had been a big crowd in? 'No, but there might have been a riot and we'd have been off for that. It was very dark. I've never played in conditions like that. I took a few risks, got 10 in an over and we were over the wire. In a matter of minutes there was complete darkness. It was the highest point of most of our careers.' </p> <p>The 'our' is significant. One of Fletcher and Hussain's successes is that they preside over a cohesive unit. 'I've always thought there was talent in England,' says Thorpe. 'It was just being led in the wrong direction. But now they've given us a great deal of confidence to be ourselves. Fletcher is a very shrewd guy and I like the way he operates.' 'When it's work time it's work time, but at other times you can let your hair down. That fits my character. I've never been a great one for wearing the right trousers or making sure I've shaved for the second or third day in a row. Naz summed it up when he said this feels like our team. It has the feeling of a county side. The players feel very much wanted and part of it.' </p> <p>It is clear that Thorpe's enthusiasm for the game has returned; yet only a year ago, when he decided to spend his winter with his family rather than among South Africans, it was on the wane. 'I was 30 when I made the decision and genuinely concerned by my lifestyle. It was constant cricket. Constant cricket. And my young family was not fitting into it at all. I needed some balance in my life.' </p> <p>After 10 consecutive years touring, last Valentine's Day was the first one he had ever spent with his wife, Nicky. He was in Sharjah when his daughter was born. Before his break, Nicky said: 'We don't have Sundays. Weekends for us haven't existed for 10 years.' 'Missing a tour hadn't been done for years,' says Thorpe, 'and a few people thought I shouldn't have done it. But it was important that I spend a lot of time with my family knowing that I might not come back. If two or three people score fantastic runs you're history.' </p> <p>Surprise, surprise, that didn't happen. Instead, Thorpe returned from his family break - 'It's a godsend to find out we can all live with each other' - a more relaxed performer. 'There's no fear, now. When you're playing constantly the very small things can become very important. I don't worry about my stats any more, but I do worry about my family. I worry about how the kids are progressing, not whether I'm averaging 35 or 45.' </p> <p> It is an approach that worked in Pakistan when, on his first tour since the break, he easily topped the batting averages with a mark over 50. And one that helped him overcome his embarrassment after Courtney Walsh bamboozled him with a slower ball on his return to the team . 'Yeah, that was a great return. If I'd been weary I would have tried to find a reason why it happened and condemned myself and felt sorry for myself. But I saw Mike Atherton in the dressing-room having a giggle to himself and so I had a giggle too.'</p> <p> Atherton is another who seems more at ease in the new surroundings. 'He's been in great form ever since Duncan Fletcher came in,' says Thorpe. 'He's an old cynic, really. When we were playing the West Indies and everyone was trying to bowl me slower balls Athers would be at the other end pissing himself and I'd look up and see that and it was great.'</p> <p>Despite all their protestations to the contrary, perhaps this England side can giggle and weave their way to an Ashes victory. Before that, though, they have to follow the Pakistan success in Sri Lanka. And the last time Australia - the team who are 'miles ahead, miles ahead' - toured there they were defeated. So the official line must be that England have no chance. They will do well to eke out a draw. Just remember to keep a straight face when you're predicting it. </p> <p><strong>Record of a run-maker</strong></p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> 1 August 1969, </p> <p>Farnham, Surrey </p> <p><strong> Batting:</strong> Left-hander </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Right-arm </p> <p>medium </p> <p><strong> County debut</strong> (Surrey)<strong> :</strong> 1988 </p> <p><strong> County cap:</strong> 1991 </p> <p><strong> Honours:</strong> Wisden Cricketer </p> <p>of the Year 1998. </p> <p><strong> TESTS</strong> </p> <p>(Debut v Australia at Trent Bridge, third Test, 1993) </p> <p><strong> M I NO Runs HS Ave 100 50 Ct</strong> </p> <p>63 115 14 3,979 138 39.39 7 26 62 </p> <p><strong> ONE-DAY INTERNATIONALS</strong> </p> <p>(Debut v Australia at Old Trafford, 1993) </p> <p><strong> M I NO Runs HS Ave 100 50 Ct</strong> </p> <p>65 61 10 2,025 89 39.70 - 18 34</p>",

'Muralitharan does not do as well against left-handers as right-handers and we are hoping Graham can capitalise on that.' Thorpe is now the middle-order mainstay of the England batting line-up. He is the man who can build on a good start, who can help England, perhaps more than any other batsman, to a formidable total; the man who can keep his head down when all about him are losing their wickets. When England were dismissed for 46 in Trinidad in 1994 it was Thorpe who batted for an hour and half to make a gritty three. He is adept against pace and flourishes against spin. It is this last quality that will be crucial in the Test series against Sri Lanka, starting this week, and in the Ashes contest in the summer. Given their current run, it is hard to believe that the last time Australia visited England, they found themselves one-nil down after the second Test. In the first, they were bowled out by Caddick (5-50) and Gough (3-43) before Hussain (207) and Thorpe (138) put on 288 and batted England to victory. In the next, Hussain and Thorpe were again the top scorers, but this time with 19 and 21, and the rain saved England. Thereafter it was less a contest than an embarrassment as England stumbled from innings defeat to innings defeat and ended up selecting both the Hollioakes. Things can only get better, but don't expect Thorpe to become carried away. 'Ideally, this summer we want to be competitive against Australia. I haven't played in a series against them where it's been tooth and nail. And last time they were here even though we went 1-0 up they just went into another gear. The Aussies have set the benchmark. They are miles ahead. Miles ahead.' Not very gung-ho, no echoes of Tony Greig's 'We'll make them grovel' there, but it can't be a coincidence that since those in charge of English cricket started talking small they have exceeded expectations rather than depressed them. Ever since those in charge of the game admitted England were not very good - a no-brainer of a confession after you've lost, by a fair way, at home to New Zealand - the team have been playing half-decent cricket. This new approach is evident as Thorpe talks you through the recent tour of Pakistan, where England were expected, at best, what with Saqlain and the other spinners and the fact we couldn't play spin, to nick a couple of draws. 'We hung on to the reins for the first two Test matches,' says Thorpe. 'In Lahore we made it safe and in Faisalabad it was a matter of staying in there. Then when it came to the crunch we were able to put our foot down.' Traditionally - recent tradition, anyway - when it comes to the crunch, English cricket crumbles. This time they accelerated. Albeit very carefully. 'Going into the last day most of us thought it could and probably should be a draw. Then Nasser and Fletch [coach Duncan Fletcher] and I came together in the physio's room at lunch to work out a strategy for what might happen. If the target was five an over we would have sent in the main hitters. Alec [Stewart] would have opened, Craig White would have gone in at three and Hicky at four and I was going to come down to six or seven. But as it was four an over we stuck with the normal batting line-up and I was going to be held back in case we had to play for a draw.' With the benefit of hindsight and ignoring recent English cricket history, I interrupt to suggest this was a bit negative. 'It can happen,' says Thorpe. 'I've seen it fall apart very quickly. And if they'd picked up four or five wickets with 20 overs to go and everyone's round the bat... ' Enough said. 'We didn't want to be too reckless. And I wasn't even going to bat and didn't have my pads on and then the leggy came on, which was good for me what with the rough, and Naz said, \"Get your pads on\".' And Thorpe went out and achieved exactly what he had envisaged achieving earlier in the day. 'While I was fielding I was thinking what a great game this would be to win. What a great time to get 50 not out and win.' He reached 50 but he was still not confident of the win. 'The last four or five overs were worrying. We were so close when Hicky got out and I was concerned when Naz came in and I asked Steve Bucknor if he would offer the light to the fielding side and he said he wouldn't.' Would he have done so if there had been a big crowd in? 'No, but there might have been a riot and we'd have been off for that. It was very dark. I've never played in conditions like that. I took a few risks, got 10 in an over and we were over the wire. In a matter of minutes there was complete darkness. It was the highest point of most of our careers.' The 'our' is significant. One of Fletcher and Hussain's successes is that they preside over a cohesive unit. 'I've always thought there was talent in England,' says Thorpe. 'It was just being led in the wrong direction. But now they've given us a great deal of confidence to be ourselves. Fletcher is a very shrewd guy and I like the way he operates.' 'When it's work time it's work time, but at other times you can let your hair down. That fits my character. I've never been a great one for wearing the right trousers or making sure I've shaved for the second or third day in a row. Naz summed it up when he said this feels like our team. It has the feeling of a county side. The players feel very much wanted and part of it.' It is clear that Thorpe's enthusiasm for the game has returned; yet only a year ago, when he decided to spend his winter with his family rather than among South Africans, it was on the wane. 'I was 30 when I made the decision and genuinely concerned by my lifestyle. It was constant cricket. Constant cricket. And my young family was not fitting into it at all. I needed some balance in my life.' After 10 consecutive years touring, last Valentine's Day was the first one he had ever spent with his wife, Nicky. He was in Sharjah when his daughter was born. Before his break, Nicky said: 'We don't have Sundays. Weekends for us haven't existed for 10 years.' 'Missing a tour hadn't been done for years,' says Thorpe, 'and a few people thought I shouldn't have done it. But it was important that I spend a lot of time with my family knowing that I might not come back. If two or three people score fantastic runs you're history.' Surprise, surprise, that didn't happen. Instead, Thorpe returned from his family break - 'It's a godsend to find out we can all live with each other' - a more relaxed performer. 'There's no fear, now. When you're playing constantly the very small things can become very important. I don't worry about my stats any more, but I do worry about my family. I worry about how the kids are progressing, not whether I'm averaging 35 or 45.' It is an approach that worked in Pakistan when, on his first tour since the break, he easily topped the batting averages with a mark over 50. And one that helped him overcome his embarrassment after Courtney Walsh bamboozled him with a slower ball on his return to the team . 'Yeah, that was a great return. If I'd been weary I would have tried to find a reason why it happened and condemned myself and felt sorry for myself. But I saw Mike Atherton in the dressing-room having a giggle to himself and so I had a giggle too.' Atherton is another who seems more at ease in the new surroundings. 'He's been in great form ever since Duncan Fletcher came in,' says Thorpe. 'He's an old cynic, really. When we were playing the West Indies and everyone was trying to bowl me slower balls Athers would be at the other end pissing himself and I'd look up and see that and it was great.' Despite all their protestations to the contrary, perhaps this England side can giggle and weave their way to an Ashes victory. Before that, though, they have to follow the Pakistan success in Sri Lanka. And the last time Australia - the team who are 'miles ahead, miles ahead' - toured there they were defeated. So the official line must be that England have no chance. They will do well to eke out a draw. Just remember to keep a straight face when you're predicting it.

      "body": "<p>If Sri Lanka play to their strengths then they will beat England. But it has seemed to me recently that whereas England now know their best eleven, our selectors do not. Last week, I applauded Nasser Hussain's appointment as England captain, for he brings out the best in his men. What is really significant, however, is that it shows how meritocratic and factionless the English set-up has become. </p> <p>England were so lost in the Nineties. Around the world we were all stunned by the sudden, apparently arbitrary banishment of Ian Botham, then David Gower, then Robin Smith by England. It seemed that non-cricketing reasons were at play. England's subsequent dismal performances showed just how much they were missed. But England have found a solid middle-order now. </p> <p>This area - once Sri Lanka's strength - has been our Achilles heel recently. All because Aravinda de Silva was dropped last year. They - it was never made clear exactly who - said Aravinda was 'past it, unfit, unmotivated, too slow, too old, too selfish. Not a team man'. Our opponents must have been laughing for the world's bowlers know that few other batsmen in the world can play with as much assurance. </p> <p>The magnitude of Aravinda's pride and talent allowed him to score some runs without any practice following his sudden recall to the Test arena against South Africa last month. Since then he has been stoking his fire with fitness and form re-ignited. I still expect great things of him. And he's two and a half years younger than Alec Stewart! Our selectors would do well to not pay too much attention to birth certificates. All selectors really have to do is to concentrate on doing what your opponents would least like you to do. </p> <p>Sri Lanka's unique cricketing culture is currently producing an outstanding crop of young batsmen. Green and a little sappy, yet very talented - but you can't play them all at the same time. Where Sri Lanka went awry in South Africa was in not having any middle-order experience but as long as the selectors learnt from their mistakes, Sri Lanka should not be handicapped against England. </p> <p>I cannot see Sanath Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu being out of form together in the way they were in South Africa. We all know what Sanath is capable of, but Marvan, once in, can bat for close to forever. Number three is a crucial position and it is asking a lot of our wicketkeeper, the dashing Kumar Sangakarra, to bat there when he could always be going in from the second ball of an innings. I would play Russel Arnold there. Great temperament, superb strokes. </p> <p>The brilliant Mahela Jayawardene - he can really make batting look so easy for one so young - should go in at four and then Aravinda at five. </p> <p>England are lucky in finally finding a fast-bowling all-rounder in Craig White. He really balances their side. Similarly, who plays at seven for Sri Lanka may be crucial. The offie-all-rounder Kumar Dharmasena might come in. His strengths are in his head, which counts for so much. </p> <p>Yet I'd be inclined to play the extra batsman, going for the experience of Hashan Tillekaratne. With Aravinda, Sanath and Russel Arnold in the team, there will be plenty of spin-bowling options for Sri Lanka. Mahela's deft little cutters and seam-up varieties could bag a few back-up wickets too. </p> <p>Sri Lanka's fast men rarely seem to fire together but if Vaas and Zoysa are fully fit they will trouble England. They have put on yards of pace since England last met them in Australia a couple of years ago and have added spite to their spice. Our fastest bowler, Dilhara Fernando, has yet to learn how to use the new ball properly but he has the great ability to hurry even class batsmen. </p> <p>Two fast men and two spinners would seem to be the ideal line-up for Sri Lanka at home, assuming Muralitharan is one of them. So much attention is focused on Murali that it would be easy to overlook the others who sooner or later will have to step up and win matches for Lanka. We are as rich in spinners as England are in seamers. </p> <p>If Murali's not 100 per cent, I wouldn't risk him. One or more of the youngsters bubbling under have it in them to be champs.</p>",

Our selectors would do well to not pay too much attention to birth certificates. All selectors really have to do is to concentrate on doing what your opponents would least like you to do. Sri Lanka's unique cricketing culture is currently producing an outstanding crop of young batsmen. Green and a little sappy, yet very talented - but you can't play them all at the same time. Where Sri Lanka went awry in South Africa was in not having any middle-order experience but as long as the selectors learnt from their mistakes, Sri Lanka should not be handicapped against England. I cannot see Sanath Jayasuriya and Marvan Atapattu being out of form together in the way they were in South Africa. We all know what Sanath is capable of, but Marvan, once in, can bat for close to forever. Number three is a crucial position and it is asking a lot of our wicketkeeper, the dashing Kumar Sangakarra, to bat there when he could always be going in from the second ball of an innings. I would play Russel Arnold there. Great temperament, superb strokes. The brilliant Mahela Jayawardene - he can really make batting look so easy for one so young - should go in at four and then Aravinda at five. England are lucky in finally finding a fast-bowling all-rounder in Craig White. He really balances their side. Similarly, who plays at seven for Sri Lanka may be crucial. The offie-all-rounder Kumar Dharmasena might come in. His strengths are in his head, which counts for so much. Yet I'd be inclined to play the extra batsman, going for the experience of Hashan Tillekaratne. With Aravinda, Sanath and Russel Arnold in the team, there will be plenty of spin-bowling options for Sri Lanka. Mahela's deft little cutters and seam-up varieties could bag a few back-up wickets too. Sri Lanka's fast men rarely seem to fire together but if Vaas and Zoysa are fully fit they will trouble England. They have put on yards of pace since England last met them in Australia a couple of years ago and have added spite to their spice. Our fastest bowler, Dilhara Fernando, has yet to learn how to use the new ball properly but he has the great ability to hurry even class batsmen. Two fast men and two spinners would seem to be the ideal line-up for Sri Lanka at home, assuming Muralitharan is one of them. So much attention is focused on Murali that it would be easy to overlook the others who sooner or later will have to step up and win matches for Lanka. We are as rich in spinners as England are in seamers. If Murali's not 100 per cent, I wouldn't risk him. One or more of the youngsters bubbling under have it in them to be champs.",

I have not come across betting on crows, but a few rupees on a horse is a passion for the men of Sri Lanka - especially a British horse. Walk into a bookmaker's, or turf accountant as they are still called here, and you will hear the distinctive tones of a British horse racing commentator describing the final few furlongs from Sandown, Market Rasen or Sedgefield. Bookies can be found on almost every shopping street and in all the smaller towns throughout Sri Lanka, in rich areas and in poor. They are open all day and close after the last race in Britain at about 11pm local time. During the day, old men can be found poring over the many form guides (I have counted five different daily publications so far, with Saddlers Special being a particular favourite). To keep customers interested into the evening, there is a 10 or 15 per cent commission on your night-time bet (you bet 100 rupees and you receive 10 or 15 back). After dark there is more atmosphere as the men come to spend their hard-earned money. Young and old, some in suits, some in sarong and flip-flops, the most popular bet is for the minimum stake of 25 rupees (20p), still a considerable sum in a place where a big lunch costs only 40 rupees (32p). Some bookmakers offer a VIP lounge for the 'big-spenders' with a minimum bet of 100 rupees (80p). All punters have their favourite jockey, trainer and sometimes owner. 'AP McCoy is my favourite,' is a phrase often heard. It is always 'AP' and never 'Tony'. Initials are all they see in the racing guides, so initials it always is. 'M Pipe is my best bugger,' announced one well-dressed gentleman who had an unusual terminology for trainers. 'C Brittain, T Barron on the flat, and Henderson [never seems to have an initial] with the hurdles.' All the punters seem to know an awful lot about British racing. 'It has been a poor season, too much rain and ice,' said one as Wetherby became the latest victim of the weather. One man was particularly scathing about Uttoxeter, which he considered, from 5,000 miles, 'highly dangerous for novice chases'. I could only nod and agree. Dogs also have a strong following and I have learnt a great deal watching my first televised races from Romford, Monmore, Crayford and Brough Park. The most popular punter was 'Mr Five' - so named because he only bet on the orange jacket. Odds on the Six Nations championship and the Premiership also flash up on the screens, but there has been no talk of betting on cricket. My questions about match-fixing and the upcoming questioning of Arivinda De Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga are met with: 'There is no betting on cricket.' They must think I'm working for Sir Paul Condon. My presence usually causes some excitement. Because I'm British, they assume I know AP McCoy personally and can tell them the winner of the next race. I protest that I know nothing, but my explanations fall on deaf ears, and when my betting slip hits the floor after the finish, so do many others following the same selection. While every man (and a few women) in a humid room full of Sri Lankans will get excited about a race on the all-weather surface at cold and windy Lingfield, very few are interested in racing in their native land - hardly surprising given that it is poorly organised, has suffered doping scandals and has been temporarily banned in recent years. The only racecourse in Sri Lanka is the old hill station of Nuwara Eliya, a town that boasts itself a 'little England' with its golf course and hotels where a tie is required. The racecourse manager, who is also a trainer and private secretary to the mayor, is hoping for six meetings this year. Four will be in Nuwara Eliya's popular 'April season' when the rich and the famous descend to escape Colombo. The Sri Lankans are looking ahead to April, but not for the local racing. They are already talking about the Grand National, and the hot tip is any horse ridden by AP McCoy. </p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Silent Witness</strong> BBC1 <br><strong> Tribe BBC2 <br> Blood on the Carpet </strong>BBC2 <br><strong> Love In A Cold Climate </strong>BBC1 </p> <p>Teenagers, eh? In <strong>Silent Witness</strong>, two dead girls were discovered in a Norwegian ski resort and defrosted by Amanda Burton's chilly pathologist, Sam Ryan, to reveal the kind of tangled emotional plots that, had they managed to stay alive long enough, they would probably have left behind by their twenties. </p> <p>One of the dead girls, Ruth, was a virgin while the other, Louise, had been pregnant with twins. It turned out that one of the twins had been fathered by her uncle (Anthony Head, so sinister he couldn't possibly be the murderer) and the other by a nice, earnest young man who worked for a travel company (obviously guilty). So they weren't really twins at all. I must lead a very sheltered life, but the possibility of this kind of genetic pick'n'mix came as a revelation. Then Anthony Head turned out not to be Louise's uncle, but her father, so one of her unborn children would have been... what, precisely? Her own sister, as well as her daughter? This was a complex set of circumstances even by teenage standards. And then it got worse, as the real murderer turned out to be neither of the prime suspects, but an employee of her father's - or at least the man we had assumed to be her father - who was keen to put Louise and the other girls preyed upon by the amoral Anthony Head out of their perceived misery. He may have had a point. </p> <p>One could tell that Professor Ryan had got a bit too involved in this case because, very occasionally, she'd reach out to make physical contact with the living, though always with considerably less relish than she showed for the dead. There are signs, however, that like last week's corpses, brittle Sam might be thawing - though we may not like what is revealed when she does. Still, in a bold leap forward for her character, Burton didn't once have to sit in a car in the rain, biting her lip pensively while contemplating the navels, spleens, livers and brains of murder victims. On the wall of her office there is even a recently installed pinboard decorated with postcards and snapshots - all heartwarming signs of life, if not yet quite a life. Hormonal chaos was explored in equally exhausting, occasionally baffling, depth by BBC2's <strong>Tribe</strong>, a nightly series of short films revealing the dark underbelly of teenagers, though it is entirely possible that in several cases there wasn't anything other than a dark underbelly. I was very worried about Laura, star of the first film, Don't Sleep With Any DJs whose fetishistic attachment to the garage music scene in general ('garage is my whole life') and the Heartless Crew (Mighty Mo, Fonty, Bushkin) in particular, was matched only by her lack of even the most basic self-awareness, marking her out as a young woman of apparently infinite stupidity. </p> <p>Laura had a job working in a club promotions company, which, somewhat dangerously, further fuelled her fantasy half-life. Laura's young female boss, Sinem, talked about trying to get her 'to apply her enthusiasm for the industry' and 'hopefully, in time, Laura will be a Mini-Me'. There seemed little chance of this. Developmentally arrested, like an overgrown toddler blunderingly testing the boundaries of her world, Laura appeared to lack whatever genetic mechanism it is that allows even a teenager to stand back and say 'hang on, maybe I'm screwing things up?' </p> <p>Sinem tried to persuade Laura that she shouldn't say 'd'ya know wot I mean?' quite so often, and that she shouldn't talk about 'raving', but use 'clubbing' instead. Laura wouldn't listen, and even argued like it mattered. It was compulsively funny-grotesque to watch, but it hurt too. Laura also argued with her friends. All of them. Prattling at the camera while showing off her Sam Ryan-style pinboard, replete with trophy mugshots, it became clear that Laura had had a lot of friends, but that none of them had lasted. Currently best friends with Sunshine ('I couldn't rave Cream of The Crop without her'), this was a relationship based, in Laura's case, on expediency and, in Sunshine's, probably on laziness ('I think we attached to each other. Like, \"you'll compensate for my loss of Vicky, I'll compensate for your loss of Caroline_ \",' explained Sunshine shortly before she stopped returning Laura's calls). Either way, by the end of the film, Laura had a new best friend, Ellie, with whom she could 'rave Cream of the Crop' for a few more weeks at least. </p> <p> But First Prize in the Self-Delusion Championships had to go to Lola Marie, star of Tuesday's film You Look Like A Proper Presenter . I would have loved to find out how Lola had ever imagined she'd make a TV presenter, but because each film took their subjects as they found them we were denied any background. 'I'm enunciaytin.

Lola kept explaining to her sweetly supportive (though baffled) boyfriend, as she forced him to watch her paid-for, semi-professional 'showreel' - shots of her accosting shoppers for perky little vox-pops, or standing in a Magnet Kitchens showroom saying 'the Corian worktop works perfect for those accidental spills!'

Conceived by Michael Lang, the man responsible for the first great festival, Woodstock 1999, sounded like a bad idea from the start, particularly given that Peace and Love is not exactly the youthful credo of our times. Wanting to recreate 'the most sacred hippy event of all time' (though, it was, arguably, only the most sacred hippy event of the latter half of one decade in the 20th century), Lang hired a disused airforce base near Rome, upstate New York, booked unlovely headline bands like Insane Clown Posse and Limp Bizkit, and recruited some of his old hippy mates. </p> <p> Lisa Law had run the original (free) Woodstock soup kitchen, while Wavy Gravy had enforced 1969's 'security' wearing a bear costume and wielding a rubber shovel, but was now mostly famous for having been immortalised, like Jerry Garcia, as an unpleasantly savoury-sounding Ben and Jerry's ice-cream flavour (beef jerky and chocolate chip hippy, or what?). Sadly, by day three of the festival, it was all going very wrong vibewise, so Wavy took to the stage. </p> <p>'I thought I could kind of sneak the crowd into \"Om-ing\"...

      "bodyText": "Silent Witness BBC1 Tribe BBC2 Blood on the Carpet BBC2 Love In A Cold Climate BBC1 Teenagers, eh? In Silent Witness, two dead girls were discovered in a Norwegian ski resort and defrosted by Amanda Burton's chilly pathologist, Sam Ryan, to reveal the kind of tangled emotional plots that, had they managed to stay alive long enough, they would probably have left behind by their twenties. One of the dead girls, Ruth, was a virgin while the other, Louise, had been pregnant with twins. It turned out that one of the twins had been fathered by her uncle (Anthony Head, so sinister he couldn't possibly be the murderer) and the other by a nice, earnest young man who worked for a travel company (obviously guilty). So they weren't really twins at all. I must lead a very sheltered life, but the possibility of this kind of genetic pick'n'mix came as a revelation. Then Anthony Head turned out not to be Louise's uncle, but her father, so one of her unborn children would have been... what, precisely? Her own sister, as well as her daughter? This was a complex set of circumstances even by teenage standards. And then it got worse, as the real murderer turned out to be neither of the prime suspects, but an employee of her father's - or at least the man we had assumed to be her father - who was keen to put Louise and the other girls preyed upon by the amoral Anthony Head out of their perceived misery. He may have had a point. One could tell that Professor Ryan had got a bit too involved in this case because, very occasionally, she'd reach out to make physical contact with the living, though always with considerably less relish than she showed for the dead. There are signs, however, that like last week's corpses, brittle Sam might be thawing - though we may not like what is revealed when she does. Still, in a bold leap forward for her character, Burton didn't once have to sit in a car in the rain, biting her lip pensively while contemplating the navels, spleens, livers and brains of murder victims. On the wall of her office there is even a recently installed pinboard decorated with postcards and snapshots - all heartwarming signs of life, if not yet quite a life. Hormonal chaos was explored in equally exhausting, occasionally baffling, depth by BBC2's Tribe, a nightly series of short films revealing the dark underbelly of teenagers, though it is entirely possible that in several cases there wasn't anything other than a dark underbelly. I was very worried about Laura, star of the first film, Don't Sleep With Any DJs whose fetishistic attachment to the garage music scene in general ('garage is my whole life') and the Heartless Crew (Mighty Mo, Fonty, Bushkin) in particular, was matched only by her lack of even the most basic self-awareness, marking her out as a young woman of apparently infinite stupidity. Laura had a job working in a club promotions company, which, somewhat dangerously, further fuelled her fantasy half-life. Laura's young female boss, Sinem, talked about trying to get her 'to apply her enthusiasm for the industry' and 'hopefully, in time, Laura will be a Mini-Me'. There seemed little chance of this. Developmentally arrested, like an overgrown toddler blunderingly testing the boundaries of her world, Laura appeared to lack whatever genetic mechanism it is that allows even a teenager to stand back and say 'hang on, maybe I'm screwing things up?' Sinem tried to persuade Laura that she shouldn't say 'd'ya know wot I mean?' quite so often, and that she shouldn't talk about 'raving', but use 'clubbing' instead. Laura wouldn't listen, and even argued like it mattered. It was compulsively funny-grotesque to watch, but it hurt too. Laura also argued with her friends. All of them. Prattling at the camera while showing off her Sam Ryan-style pinboard, replete with trophy mugshots, it became clear that Laura had had a lot of friends, but that none of them had lasted. Currently best friends with Sunshine ('I couldn't rave Cream of The Crop without her'), this was a relationship based, in Laura's case, on expediency and, in Sunshine's, probably on laziness ('I think we attached to each other. Like, \"you'll compensate for my loss of Vicky, I'll compensate for your loss of Caroline_ \",' explained Sunshine shortly before she stopped returning Laura's calls). Either way, by the end of the film, Laura had a new best friend, Ellie, with whom she could 'rave Cream of the Crop' for a few more weeks at least. But First Prize in the Self-Delusion Championships had to go to Lola Marie, star of Tuesday's film You Look Like A Proper Presenter . I would have loved to find out how Lola had ever imagined she'd make a TV presenter, but because each film took their subjects as they found them we were denied any background. 'I'm enunciaytin. Enun-see-aytin!' Lola kept explaining to her sweetly supportive (though baffled) boyfriend, as she forced him to watch her paid-for, semi-professional 'showreel' - shots of her accosting shoppers for perky little vox-pops, or standing in a Magnet Kitchens showroom saying 'the Corian worktop works perfect for those accidental spills!' Lola then sent her tape to the producers of Changing Rooms and, as a piece of comparative advertising, it worked brilliantly. Thanks to Lola I now recognise just how talented Carol Smillie really is.

      "trailText": "<p><strong> Hannibal </strong> (131 mins, 18) Directed by Ridley Scott; starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Giancarlo Giannini </p>",
      "byline": "Philip French",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Hannibal </strong> (131 mins, 18) Directed by Ridley Scott; starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Giancarlo Giannini </p> <p> The midpoint of the twentieth century and its end were both dominated by cinematic villains with identical initials whose brief appearances in secondary roles enabled them to hijack the films in which they appeared and to insist upon a separate life. In 1949, Harry Lime, the vicious postwar racketeer, whose contaminated penicillin maimed and killed children in Vienna, somehow became the hero of The Third Man. Subsequently, in somewhat laundered form, Lime became the eponymous protagonist of radio and TV series starring respectively Orson Welles and Michael Rennie. </p> <p>Forty years later, the cannibalistic murderer, Dr Hannibal Lecter, though scarcely seen outside his dungeon, dominated The Silence of the Lambs, and for a decade his creator, Thomas Harris, worked on a novel putting him stage centre, which now reaches the screen as Hannibal, with Anthony Hopkins reprising his Oscar-winning role. On the face of it, Hannibal is far worse than Lime, but in fact all his despicable victims are somehow culpable, while Lime's were innocents. Both Welles and Hopkins are smooth-faced performers, resembling evil babies and are given to ingratiating themselves with smiling eyes and sinister grins. </p> <p>Welles came to The Third Man from playing Cesare Borgia in The Prince of Foxes, and immediately before Hannibal Hopkins took the title role in a film of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, a similar story of cannibalism and mutilation that probably influenced Harris. What Lime and Hannibal have in common is the way they are drawn to the Renaissance world where civilised values and exquisite cruelty intermingle. </p> <p>The fugitive Hannibal has found a perfect billet, running a quattrocento library in a Florentine palazzo and studying Renaissance iconography. The self-justifying lines that Welles put into the mouth of Lime could as easily have been spoken by Lecter - 'In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed - they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy and peace and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.' Perhaps we feel that Lime and Hannibal help to make sense of the terrible twentieth century. </p> <p>Ridley Scott's Hannibal, which has been adapted with considerable fidelity by David Mamet, Steven Zaillian and uncredited others, differs considerably from the two previous films featuring Lecter. Both Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs are police procedural movies in which the FBI's behavioural science department tracks down colourful serial killers. In the first, Brian Cox's Lecter helps veteran agent Will Graham (William Petersen) pursue the infamous 'Tooth Fairy'. In the second, Hopkins's Lecter assists the tyro agent Clarice Starling to understand the mentality of the sadistic 'Buffalo Bill'. Hannibal, on the other hand, is a combination of Jacobean revenge drama and Edgar Allan Poe gothic tale. </p> <p>It begins like a police procedural piece with a brilliantly staged drug raid in Washington's open-air fish market (a raffish location that recalls the streets in Blade Runner) that concludes with the raid's leader, Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), washing the HIV blood of a dangerous Hispanic woman gangster from the baby she's been carrying as cover. The shot prepares the way for a series of bloody images that punctuate the film. But this opening is designed as a way of isolating Clarice, a woman of unimpeachable probity, from her dishonest, cowardly, self-seeking colleagues in a variety of federal agencies and, most especially, from the devious, misogynistic Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) from the Justice Department, a creepy philistine who can't even pronounce 'fiefdom' (his version rhymes with 'knifed'em'). </p> <p>Krendler is in league with billionaire Mason Verger (Gary Oldman unrecognisable behind his prosthetic disguise and named only in the final credits), a hideously disfigured cripple who lives on the magnificent Biltmore Estate in North Carolina, the biggest private mansion in America. Verger, a vicious paedophile whose face Lecter peeled and fed to the dogs, is Hannibal's only surviving victim and he intends to take his revenge by feeding him to a herd of ravenous wild boars specially bred in Sardinia (where else?). </p> <p>In order to lure the elusive doctor, Clarice is put back on the case, but at the very moment she's tracking him down to Florence, he's located by Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). Pazzi is a Florentine aristocrat by name (an ancestor was hanged for murdering a Medici in the fifteenth century) and a patsy by nature, a fool who thinks he can tangle with Hannibal. With an expensive young wife and a taste for Armani threads, the sad Pazzi decides to sell the fugitive American to Verger. Lecter, who likes to combine massive retaliation with witty conceits, prepares an elaborate death fit for a Renaissance Pazzi. </p> <p>The film's Florence is far removed from the elegant, glowing city of A Room with a View. As lit by the talented British cameraman John Mathieson (who worked with Scott on Gladiator), this is a dark, satanic place of renaissance intrigue. </p> <p>The only convincing explanation for a man on the FBI's '10 Most Wanted' list deciding to live here in plain sight is that everyone walks around in the shadows. Even when Hannibal goes to the opera, it's a gloomy work based on Dante's Inferno staged at night in the cloisters of a Renaissance palace. But the stylised, highly-charged atmosphere deters us from looking at the movie in any literal way, just as later on when Clarice comes to Hannibal's rescue, Verger's stronghold proves to be like the lair of a Bond villain, at once impregnable and easy to penetrate. </p> <p>Much of the feeling we have for the relationship of Clarice and Hannibal we bring from The Silence of the Lambs. Moore's likeable Clarice is older, tougher, yet no less vulnerable than Jodie Foster's. She is, however, much more disillusioned, and thus, while retaining a strong sense of right and wrong, she's closer in her view of the world to the Machiavellian joker, Hannibal, with whom Hopkins has so much fun. But they were more interesting when he was playing mind games while helping her investigations than now when the two of them are outsiders and uneasy allies, in her case fighting a Protestant conscience that insists Lecter be turned over to the authorities. </p> <p>Clarice and Hannibal first make contact through an exotic clue he plants in a letter to her, and then accidentally via a third party's cellphone. But they are never in close proximity until they stalk each other in a dynamic sequence set in Washington's Union Station (a place now given over to boutiques and fairground shows) and don't meet until the last couple of reels. In this, the film resembles a macabre variation of Nora Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, those chastely romantic comedies of consummation postponed starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. </p> <p>There are a couple of scenes - one involving a disembowelling, the other gourmet cranial surgery - that are deliberately excessive, intended to make us flinch as we laugh at Hannibal's terrible wit. Mostly, though, the movie is pretty restrained. Lecter's cannibalism, we learn, has so endeared him to connoisseurs in a society devoted to the culinary arts that a former male nurse at the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane has sold Hannibal's signed copy of The Joy of Cooking to a collector for $6,000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hannibal (131 mins, 18) Directed by Ridley Scott; starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Giancarlo Giannini The midpoint of the twentieth century and its end were both dominated by cinematic villains with identical initials whose brief appearances in secondary roles enabled them to hijack the films in which they appeared and to insist upon a separate life. In 1949, Harry Lime, the vicious postwar racketeer, whose contaminated penicillin maimed and killed children in Vienna, somehow became the hero of The Third Man. Subsequently, in somewhat laundered form, Lime became the eponymous protagonist of radio and TV series starring respectively Orson Welles and Michael Rennie. Forty years later, the cannibalistic murderer, Dr Hannibal Lecter, though scarcely seen outside his dungeon, dominated The Silence of the Lambs, and for a decade his creator, Thomas Harris, worked on a novel putting him stage centre, which now reaches the screen as Hannibal, with Anthony Hopkins reprising his Oscar-winning role. On the face of it, Hannibal is far worse than Lime, but in fact all his despicable victims are somehow culpable, while Lime's were innocents. Both Welles and Hopkins are smooth-faced performers, resembling evil babies and are given to ingratiating themselves with smiling eyes and sinister grins. Welles came to The Third Man from playing Cesare Borgia in The Prince of Foxes, and immediately before Hannibal Hopkins took the title role in a film of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, a similar story of cannibalism and mutilation that probably influenced Harris. What Lime and Hannibal have in common is the way they are drawn to the Renaissance world where civilised values and exquisite cruelty intermingle. The fugitive Hannibal has found a perfect billet, running a quattrocento library in a Florentine palazzo and studying Renaissance iconography. The self-justifying lines that Welles put into the mouth of Lime could as easily have been spoken by Lecter - 'In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed - they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy and peace and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.' Perhaps we feel that Lime and Hannibal help to make sense of the terrible twentieth century. Ridley Scott's Hannibal, which has been adapted with considerable fidelity by David Mamet, Steven Zaillian and uncredited others, differs considerably from the two previous films featuring Lecter. Both Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs are police procedural movies in which the FBI's behavioural science department tracks down colourful serial killers. In the first, Brian Cox's Lecter helps veteran agent Will Graham (William Petersen) pursue the infamous 'Tooth Fairy'. In the second, Hopkins's Lecter assists the tyro agent Clarice Starling to understand the mentality of the sadistic 'Buffalo Bill'. Hannibal, on the other hand, is a combination of Jacobean revenge drama and Edgar Allan Poe gothic tale. It begins like a police procedural piece with a brilliantly staged drug raid in Washington's open-air fish market (a raffish location that recalls the streets in Blade Runner) that concludes with the raid's leader, Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), washing the HIV blood of a dangerous Hispanic woman gangster from the baby she's been carrying as cover. The shot prepares the way for a series of bloody images that punctuate the film. But this opening is designed as a way of isolating Clarice, a woman of unimpeachable probity, from her dishonest, cowardly, self-seeking colleagues in a variety of federal agencies and, most especially, from the devious, misogynistic Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) from the Justice Department, a creepy philistine who can't even pronounce 'fiefdom' (his version rhymes with 'knifed'em'). Krendler is in league with billionaire Mason Verger (Gary Oldman unrecognisable behind his prosthetic disguise and named only in the final credits), a hideously disfigured cripple who lives on the magnificent Biltmore Estate in North Carolina, the biggest private mansion in America. Verger, a vicious paedophile whose face Lecter peeled and fed to the dogs, is Hannibal's only surviving victim and he intends to take his revenge by feeding him to a herd of ravenous wild boars specially bred in Sardinia (where else?). In order to lure the elusive doctor, Clarice is put back on the case, but at the very moment she's tracking him down to Florence, he's located by Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). Pazzi is a Florentine aristocrat by name (an ancestor was hanged for murdering a Medici in the fifteenth century) and a patsy by nature, a fool who thinks he can tangle with Hannibal. With an expensive young wife and a taste for Armani threads, the sad Pazzi decides to sell the fugitive American to Verger. Lecter, who likes to combine massive retaliation with witty conceits, prepares an elaborate death fit for a Renaissance Pazzi. The film's Florence is far removed from the elegant, glowing city of A Room with a View. As lit by the talented British cameraman John Mathieson (who worked with Scott on Gladiator), this is a dark, satanic place of renaissance intrigue. The only convincing explanation for a man on the FBI's '10 Most Wanted' list deciding to live here in plain sight is that everyone walks around in the shadows. Even when Hannibal goes to the opera, it's a gloomy work based on Dante's Inferno staged at night in the cloisters of a Renaissance palace. But the stylised, highly-charged atmosphere deters us from looking at the movie in any literal way, just as later on when Clarice comes to Hannibal's rescue, Verger's stronghold proves to be like the lair of a Bond villain, at once impregnable and easy to penetrate. Much of the feeling we have for the relationship of Clarice and Hannibal we bring from The Silence of the Lambs. Moore's likeable Clarice is older, tougher, yet no less vulnerable than Jodie Foster's. She is, however, much more disillusioned, and thus, while retaining a strong sense of right and wrong, she's closer in her view of the world to the Machiavellian joker, Hannibal, with whom Hopkins has so much fun. But they were more interesting when he was playing mind games while helping her investigations than now when the two of them are outsiders and uneasy allies, in her case fighting a Protestant conscience that insists Lecter be turned over to the authorities. Clarice and Hannibal first make contact through an exotic clue he plants in a letter to her, and then accidentally via a third party's cellphone. But they are never in close proximity until they stalk each other in a dynamic sequence set in Washington's Union Station (a place now given over to boutiques and fairground shows) and don't meet until the last couple of reels. In this, the film resembles a macabre variation of Nora Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, those chastely romantic comedies of consummation postponed starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. There are a couple of scenes - one involving a disembowelling, the other gourmet cranial surgery - that are deliberately excessive, intended to make us flinch as we laugh at Hannibal's terrible wit. Mostly, though, the movie is pretty restrained. Lecter's cannibalism, we learn, has so endeared him to connoisseurs in a society devoted to the culinary arts that a former male nurse at the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane has sold Hannibal's signed copy of The Joy of Cooking to a collector for $6,000.",

The universal bank, which will be subsidised by seven high street banks, is a no-frills account for those who have been turned away from a high street bank. It is designed to deal with just pensions and benefits. Payments will be credited to a post office account card. There will be no charge for using the facility. The various projects sound good, but will the Post Office be able to deliver? Derek French of the Campaign for Community Banking Services believes post offices in small communities will not be able to cope with the increased workload. 'Imagine the queues with people coming in to do all manner of business. Things already grind to a halt for the more complex transactions.' French thinks the PO has not thought its plans through and is lobbying the Government to rethink. However, PO spokeswoman Corfield says postmasters will be able to do things much faster than they can now. 'I know post office queues are still laughed at but we are a lot faster than banks or supermarkets. 'Ninety-five per cent of customers are served within five minutes and we will continue to monitor the situation carefully. The changes are to make smaller businesses more viable by increasing business.' But what if you just want to post a letter or use one of the Post Offices other traditional services? 'We are part of the everyday fabric of life and we intend to stay that way,' says the Royal Mail's new head, Gillian Wilmot. Consignia gets smart In the new Post Office you will be able to: \u0095 Bank with all major high street banks and access many internet bank accounts. \u0095 Open an account at the universal bank, which will allow you to receive benefit or pension payments. \u0095 Buy a Standard Life stakeholder pension from 5 April. \u0095 Make stakeholder contributions and pay gas and electricity bills with a smartcard. \u0095 Apply online for passports, driving licences and other government-controlled documents in a special kiosk. A trial starts in July in Leicestershire. \u0095 Charge up a smartcard for bus journeys if you are eligible for free travel. A trial will start in Manchester later this year.",

But what if women really are more likely to bayonet themselves or their comrades and cannot climb out of trenches, as the Army trials suggest? Wrong trials, we say. A clear case of institutional sexism. Gender-free testing may mean not making allowances for women. But it also means establishing rules that do not advantage men. So, ban those boys' toys - a modern army doesn't need guns and knives; make the trenches shallower and appoint a few dozen women generals. And does the Army really need so many maps?",

It's a pessimistic comedy, heavily influenced by Bu\u00f1uel and Ionesco, taking a bleak view of the millennium. </p> <p>Performed by a non-professional cast, the film unfolds in a series of tableaux, each shot in deep focus in a single take from a fixed point of view. Only once does the camera move, when a tracking shot follows a man down a station platform. Crowds of flagellating penitents walk the streets of a gridlocked city. Heads of the armed forces gather to celebrate the hundredth birth day of a senile fascist. A businessman, whose poet son is in an asylum, walks the streets after burning down his office and gets a job selling crucifixes for the millennium. A magician screws up while sawing a volunteer in half. Representatives of Church and State cast a virgin into a quarry as a form of sacrifice. A party of middle-class Scandinavian xenophobes beat to a pulp a central European who asks for their help. Parties of tourists attempt to cross an airport concourse with impossible quantities of luggage. And so it goes. </p> <p>Equipped with music by the director's unrelated namesake, Benny Andersson of Abba, Songs From the Second Floor is a technical tour de force. But Andersson brings an end to such nervous laughter as the film has generated by introducing at the halfway mark the ghost of a Holocaust victim whom, in a flashback, we've seen hanged by the SS alongside his sister. </p> <p>In <strong> State and Main</strong>, his first disappointing film to date, David Mamet gently mocks the moviemaking business through an account of the crises attendant on the shooting of a minor Hollywood movie in a small Vermont town. The production had to shift there as the result of an unmentionable event that had them ejected from New Hampshire, and though the picture (a costume piece set in the late nineteenth-century) is called The Old Mill, they discover that the local mill was burned down in 1960. </p> <p>Every character is overly familiar, from the second-rank star with a penchant for underage girls (convincingly played by Alec Baldwin) to the idealistic playwright seeing his first screenplay being mangled (a surprisingly uncertain Philip Seymour Hoffman). The film-within-the-film doesn't ring true and is as remote from Mamet's own work as were the dated plays he sent up in his one truly feeble stage play, A Life in the Theatre. It doesn't compare with his acid satire on Hollywood, Speed the Plow, or Alan Alda's generous comedy about the collision between small-town folk and filmmakers, Sweet Liberty . </p> <p>Far funnier is Nicholas Hytner's <strong> Centre Stage, </strong> a virtual anthology of every dance movie clich\u00e9 packed into a year at the American Ballet Academy in New York. Can Jody cut it? Will talented African-American Eve get over her defensive arrogance? And so on. From a dozen cherishable lines, my favourite is delivered by the coldly disciplined student to the mother who's driven her on to fulfil her frustrated ambitions: 'You didn't have the feet - I didn't have the heart.' </p> <p>There are, as they say, some staggering dancers here, but fortunately they pull themselves together when they get away from the script and on to the stage. Unfortunately, these performances are sacrificed to those last-minute changes of cast occasioned by broken knees and cold feet. The climactic ballet, though well danced, is intended to be a dramatic allegory about the rivalry between its creator, the company's leading dancer, and the American Ballet's director but is, in fact, excessively vulgar. </p> <p>It would be pleasant, and characteristic, for me to say how wonderful the reissued 1961 <strong> Breakfast at Tiffany's</strong> is, and how they don't make them like this anymore. In fact, I'd forgotten just how dreadfully indulgent a celebration of bogus eccentricity it is. The film shifts Truman Capote's novella from the last months of the Second World War to 1960 and turns the narrator into a rather dubious heterosexual, the way I Am a Camera turned the Christopher Isherwood of Goodbye to Berlin into a straight. There's no doubt that Isherwood's wilful Sally Bowles inspired Capote's capricious Holly Golightly, and both help to create the present dramatic tradition of bruised women with sympathetic gay confidantes. </p> <p>Audrey Hepburn looks beautiful (she's photographed by the great Czech-born veteran who lit her in Roman Holiday, The Nun's Story and The Children's Hour), but she's a pain in the neck (mine, not her swan-like cou) and the film has an ineffable vulgarity in its cultural assumptions and social observation. The endless drinking jokes can be forgiven considering that the following year Blake Edwards made Days of Wine and Roses , one of the best studies of alcoholism. Inexcusable, however, is Mickey Rooney's performance as the irate Japanese photographer on the top floor of Holly's brownstone apartment house. This is racism that comes close to the anti-Semitic caricatures in Julius Streicher's Der St\u00fcrmer . </p> <p>The latest Disney animated feature, <strong> The Emperor's New Groove</strong>, arrives here after widely publicised production problems and box-office disaster over Christmas. In fact, this tale of a hubristic young prince in pre-Columbian America learning a little humility from a kindly peasant after he's been turned into a llama by a wicked sorceress isn't at all bad. The self-referential post-modernist style is amusing and there are fewer songs than usual, though one of them - Sting and David Hartley's 'My Funny Friend and Me' - has been Oscar nominated. </p> <p>Inspired by the seminal, 25-year-old adolescent game, <strong> Dungeons and Dragons</strong> is a slow, oppressive sword-and-sorcery romance. Shot in Prague with an Anglo-American cast headed by Jeremy Irons and including such cult luminaries as Tom Baker and Richard O'Brien, it might well have been called 'Look Who's Tolkien'.</p>",

He sent his medal back and disavowed his German clients, but he still kept the tabulators turning, still gathered the profits, was still on hand as the conflict ended to turn Dehomag into IBM Germany and go marching on. That, in a sense, is all you need to know. It is a distinctive contribution to the history of the time. It wholly justifies Black's years of toil.

I'd been struggling with my concentration for a while - it affected me badly at the 1996 Olympics - so, at my coach Ian Coley's suggestion, in 1998 I hooked up with Peter. My problem was that in between shooting pairs of clays, I thought about silly things like what I was going to have for tea. Irrelevant stuff, but it put me off. I was struggling to keep a one-track mind.</p> <p>Initially he introduced me to deep-breathing routines, but they didn't work. </p> <p>I ended up thinking more about breathing than shooting. Then Peter came up with this idea of The Iceman. He said, 'I would describe you as a pretty cool character. I'm going to call you The Iceman'. He meant that I was cool, calm and collected, that nothing would rattle me. That was a good reading of my personality on the outside, but inside I was thinking, 'Bloody hell, I'm so frustrated I want to chuck the empty shotgun cartridges across the shooting range.' He put a little blue-dot sticker in the middle of my watch. The idea was that when I looked at my watch, I would think: 'I am The Iceman' and have a single-track mind.</p> <p>It sounds silly, but it worked instantly. Within three weeks I won the British Open and the World Championships and set a new world record of 193 clays out of 200. My concentration improved completely. Peter helped me hugely during last year's Olympics in Sydney. Five of us shared a house - myself, Peter, Ian Coley, Ian Peel, another shooter Peter was working with who won a silver medal, and Joe Neville, Ian's coach. Peter was brilliant.</p> <p>I really benefited from Peter's influence during the head-to-head shoot-off to decide between gold and silver. The crowd was supporting Russell Mark, the defending champion who's Australian. But I blocked all that out and ended up with a gold medal. I couldn't have done it without Peter. He has recently moved to Australia, but he'll continue to play a role in my shooting, like at the World Championships in Cairo in May. Once something's going quite well, you don't like to change it.</p> <p><strong>Peter Terry</strong> Before meeting Richard I'd worked with the England cricket team, Welsh rugby side, snooker players such as Jimmy White, and the British bobsleigh crew which won bronze at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Richard was shooting badly in big competitions because he was getting nervous. He didn't believe he could break through at the highest level. That's an almost universal problem among elite sports people - only a minority think they're going to win. Most only hope to win. </p> <p>I worked on Richard's thought processes, some of his attitudes about himself and some aspects of his physical control. He had no psychological problems - he was just a normal guy struggling to get the best out of himself. He's an uncomplicated man so I decided to keep it simple and not overload him with things to think about.</p> <p>The blue dot was meant to keep Richard composed. Every time he saw it, he had to practise his breathing. He needed that to avoid getting into a rapid downward spiral where he starts to think about things going wrong, which leads to physical tension, and he misses clays. The Iceman idea gave him an anchor to fix all his effort on during tournaments. In competition, he'd been more of a nervous child than an Iceman, but he underwent psychological growth.</p> <p>Richard's mum told Ian Coley and me that the best way to keep him happy in Sydney was to do everything for him, so we did exactly that. All he had to do was hit clays. I played the Whitney Houston song 'One Moment in Time' to make him think he was there to fulfil his destiny. Its lyrics are fantastic for sport - 'You're a winner for a lifetime/if you seize that one moment in time'. At first he sang along but then he went quiet because he was listening to it.</p> <p>Happily Sydney was Richard's moment in time. Our preparations paid off. In the shoot-off, he really was The Iceman. People say, 'You've helped to create an Olympic champion.' I see it as helping someone become something they were always capable of becoming. He says he couldn't have done it without me, but he may well be wrong about that.</p>",

But I still ended up homeless in a burnt-out car in Peckham, scoring drugs off the street. For me, the nature of addiction is to be aware but powerless to do anything about it.</p> <p>I was one of those \"Thank you what was that\" kind of addicts. I'd try anything, do anything. There was a time when I used drugs and their use interfered in my family life, my work life, then I crossed a line and my family and social life impinged on my drug use. At which point I was chronically addicted - anything that got in the way of my addiction got trashed.</p> <p>I got a habit within the first three months of taking heroin. Then I started on cocaine and crack. I've burnt half my lungs out on the pipe. No holding back. I lived with my then boyfriend and all we did was hang around taking drugs, dealing drugs. I first went into rehab in 1983, but I used the day I came out. Eventually, I went through 12 rehab places.</p> <p>The last time, I could barely speak, I was so terrified. I was on probation for theft. I was using methadone, crack cocaine, Rohypnol, a heady cocktail. I was constantly overdosing and coming round in hospital. I hated myself. I had burgled my own parents.

But I still ended up homeless in a burnt-out car in Peckham, scoring drugs off the street. For me, the nature of addiction is to be aware but powerless to do anything about it. I was one of those \"Thank you what was that\" kind of addicts. I'd try anything, do anything. There was a time when I used drugs and their use interfered in my family life, my work life, then I crossed a line and my family and social life impinged on my drug use. At which point I was chronically addicted - anything that got in the way of my addiction got trashed. I got a habit within the first three months of taking heroin. Then I started on cocaine and crack. I've burnt half my lungs out on the pipe. No holding back. I lived with my then boyfriend and all we did was hang around taking drugs, dealing drugs. I first went into rehab in 1983, but I used the day I came out. Eventually, I went through 12 rehab places. The last time, I could barely speak, I was so terrified. I was on probation for theft. I was using methadone, crack cocaine, Rohypnol, a heady cocktail. I was constantly overdosing and coming round in hospital. I hated myself. I had burgled my own parents. I'd lost the will to live. I just wanted it to stop. I went to an NA meeting and a woman who worked for a rehab charity asked if I seriously wanted help, and I said I did.

      "body": "<p>Four years ago, Joe Hagan bought a disused cab office in Clerkenwell. It was an odd site - a ramshackle old one-storey building with little potential, and so cheap it could have virtually been bought on a credit card. But Hagan had a vision; he wanted to fill the 11ft gap between the buildings on each side with glass and light, and make the derelict space his family home - an urban town house for the 21st century. The plans were drawn up and the foundations laid for a building with dimensions of 11ft wide by 28ft deep, but then Hagan, the architect who prefers to be known as a DJ, ran out of money. </p> <p>The Gap, as it was to be called, was put on hold. But then along came Ben and Geraldine Atfield. Hagan had worked on their Bermondsey warehouse a few years before, and they had followed his new venture with interest. They'd had enough of open-plan living and wanted something that was still modern and urban, but with a little more structure and a few more rooms. It wasn't long before the contractors were back on site and the construction was moving full steam ahead. Hagan would build his dream home after all. He just wouldn't live in it once it was finished. </p> <p>Eighteen months and around \u00a3350,000 later, and the Atfields have moved into their new home, all seven floors of it. They moved just before Christmas, and barely two weeks later, Thomas was born. Geraldine is taking it all in her stride, getting used to having maternity leave from her job as a director for a multinational company, breast-feeding and her new vertical lifestyle all at once. 'Wherever you live, there are great things about having a baby there,' she says, mid-feed, sitting on a chunky leather sofa in the fourth-floor living room. 'In an open-plan place, there are fewer rooms, so the baby stuff would build up in a big pile.' In The Gap, the baby stuff simply builds up in the lift, waiting to be moved from the third-floor kitchen to the ground floor, or from the first-floor nursery to the fourth-floor living room. 'It's like a dumb waiter,' she says. </p> <p>The lift is central to the building's construction. Left to his own devices, Hagan would have had a simple staircase connecting the floors. 'To me, space and transparency are the most important things,' he says. 'The lift shaft is a static object in the middle of the space. But it's down to the individual. There's always a trade-off between space and utility. Ben wanted it because it's important to him and it's quite a luxurious thing to have. But town houses have stairs.' </p> <p>We are standing at the top of the building, on the roof terrace, overlooking the building work opposite. Glass doors open out on to the terrace to the front of the house, making the room a mixture of inside and out. Hagan is particularly proud of the timber cladding he has used down one side of the building, making a 'garden fence' on part of the terrace. The architect cut a window out of the fence the same proportions as a widescreen TV, so that the urban landscape beyond is framed for viewing. 'I was brought up in the suburbs and always liked suburban iconography,' he says. </p> <p>To the back of the house, a window runs the full width of the room, with a view out to architect Nigel Coates's office just next door and the British Telecom Tower in the distance. The views are panoramic, and as you pull the window open you feel as if you might get pulled out with it. 'I'm really bad with heights,' says Hagan. 'But it's great to introduce an element of danger.' </p> <p>When the weather warms up, the Atfields will make full use of their summer room on the top of the house. It will be the perfect place for dinner parties, or simply sitting and watching the world go by as the sun sets. It's difficult not to watch the world outside from the house. The glass windows are fitted from floor to ceiling, and you are drawn to them. Standing at the edge makes you feel a little dizzy. 'I think some people have a thing about curtains and blinds,' says Geraldine. The only room in the house that has curtains is the couple's bedroom. 'I don't have a problem sitting in the kitchen at night, breast-feeding. I don't have a problem with privacy. Some people like to close out the world. I like to look out of the window and watch the world go by.' She is quick to point out that she is not an exhibitionist. And it's true, it would be crazy to block out the views outside. They are part of the house itself. Having all that open space outside makes the interior feel much more spacious and airy than it actually is. </p> <p>'You watch people looking up at the house,' says Ben, who works as sales director at ePolitix.com, an online political information service. 'Before, it was a horrible hole in the wall. Now, at night, when it's lit up, it looks stunning. It's one of the most original, exciting domestic spaces to be built in London. Every floor is a room, and every room has a specific function.' </p> <p>The ground floor, which is raised up slightly to make it feel a bit more theatrical, serves as a utility space, with washing machine and dryer fitted into purpose-built alcoves. A stairway leads down into the basement, which is serving as a workroom until the house is properly finished. It has a shower and bathroom in it, so guests will be able to stay there, and it will also be a study. The first and second floors are also bedrooms, each with their own bath or shower rooms. Thomas's nursery already feels like home, with its cot and baby toys. </p> <p>The Gap might be a cool bit of modern architecture, but the baby, with all of his primary-coloured toys and equipment, prevents the place being at all precious. When he gets old enough to crawl, Geraldine says the house will become like 'the Which? Guide to safety gates'. But she is confident that the baby will adapt to the space quite easily. 'Kids have a natural sense of depth once they get used to moving,' she says. Above the bedrooms are the kitchen and dining room, and the living room, which has a bright and bold hanging on the outside wall of the lift shaft. 'We've done everything white now because we haven't had time to work out the colours yet,' says Geraldine. 'But I like white - particularly in a building like this.' </p> <p>The overall affect is both dramatic and homely at the same time. The limestone floors make it feel functional yet luxurious. And every millimetre of available space has been used. There are little alcoves set into the walls around the lift shaft for storage. The bathrooms are ingenious. Two are simply shower rooms, with Philippe Starck fittings and a lip in the limestone floor to stop the water flooding out; one has a bath actually set into the floor. 'It was complex to seal it up,' says Joe. It is made out of timber, and lined with fibreglass. The limestone was laid on top. The result is very Japanese. You have to step down into it, and it's deep enough for the water to support the bather's weight. For Thomas, it is like an Olympic swimming pool. </p> <p>Both Geraldine and Ben say they could never go back to open-plan loft living. 'When I bought the plot from Joe, it was a completely unique opportunity to create a new freehold building in the centre of London,' says Ben. As an investment, it has probably already doubled in price. 'You're always going to make money if you build properly,' says Joe, who walks past The Gap on his way to work from his Barbican apartment every morning, and when it is lit up in all its glory by night. 'I would like to be living here,' he says. 'It got too expensive, though. It would have swallowed everything for us to build. But I'm not as jealous as I thought I would be. What's been brilliant has been being able to build it. I'm an architect; I build things. Then, once it's done, you just move on to the next bit of theatre.'</p> <p><strong>Close quarters</strong></p> <p>Right now, Joe Hagan's three-person practice, USE, is concentrating on a bar in Greenwich called South Pole. It's below a pub called the North Pole. 'The design aesthetic is aircraft meets igloo,' says Joe, who also teaches one day a week at the South Bank University and DJs once a month downstairs at the Great Eastern Dining Rooms in Shoreditch. </p> <p>Hagan has recently started work on a penthouse extension with a garden in Old Street which he describes as 'Palm Springs comes to Old Street'. In May 2000, he completed the live/work showroom and headquarters ofstreetwear label Maharishi in Shoreditch, and redesigned the interior of a one-bedroom apartment for some neighbours in the Barbican. 'The budgets for these projects aren't vast,' he says. The Barbican interior - redesigned to provide office space under a mezzanine bed, as well as a pied-\u00e0-terre for a jet-set couple who have a warehouse in Belgium - was on a budget of \u00a330,000.</p> <p>USE Architects can be contacted on 020 8986 8111.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, Joe Hagan bought a disused cab office in Clerkenwell. It was an odd site - a ramshackle old one-storey building with little potential, and so cheap it could have virtually been bought on a credit card. But Hagan had a vision; he wanted to fill the 11ft gap between the buildings on each side with glass and light, and make the derelict space his family home - an urban town house for the 21st century. The plans were drawn up and the foundations laid for a building with dimensions of 11ft wide by 28ft deep, but then Hagan, the architect who prefers to be known as a DJ, ran out of money. The Gap, as it was to be called, was put on hold. But then along came Ben and Geraldine Atfield. Hagan had worked on their Bermondsey warehouse a few years before, and they had followed his new venture with interest. They'd had enough of open-plan living and wanted something that was still modern and urban, but with a little more structure and a few more rooms. It wasn't long before the contractors were back on site and the construction was moving full steam ahead. Hagan would build his dream home after all. He just wouldn't live in it once it was finished. Eighteen months and around \u00a3350,000 later, and the Atfields have moved into their new home, all seven floors of it. They moved just before Christmas, and barely two weeks later, Thomas was born. Geraldine is taking it all in her stride, getting used to having maternity leave from her job as a director for a multinational company, breast-feeding and her new vertical lifestyle all at once. 'Wherever you live, there are great things about having a baby there,' she says, mid-feed, sitting on a chunky leather sofa in the fourth-floor living room. 'In an open-plan place, there are fewer rooms, so the baby stuff would build up in a big pile.' In The Gap, the baby stuff simply builds up in the lift, waiting to be moved from the third-floor kitchen to the ground floor, or from the first-floor nursery to the fourth-floor living room. 'It's like a dumb waiter,' she says. The lift is central to the building's construction. Left to his own devices, Hagan would have had a simple staircase connecting the floors. 'To me, space and transparency are the most important things,' he says. 'The lift shaft is a static object in the middle of the space. But it's down to the individual. There's always a trade-off between space and utility. Ben wanted it because it's important to him and it's quite a luxurious thing to have. But town houses have stairs.' We are standing at the top of the building, on the roof terrace, overlooking the building work opposite. Glass doors open out on to the terrace to the front of the house, making the room a mixture of inside and out. Hagan is particularly proud of the timber cladding he has used down one side of the building, making a 'garden fence' on part of the terrace. The architect cut a window out of the fence the same proportions as a widescreen TV, so that the urban landscape beyond is framed for viewing. 'I was brought up in the suburbs and always liked suburban iconography,' he says. To the back of the house, a window runs the full width of the room, with a view out to architect Nigel Coates's office just next door and the British Telecom Tower in the distance. The views are panoramic, and as you pull the window open you feel as if you might get pulled out with it. 'I'm really bad with heights,' says Hagan. 'But it's great to introduce an element of danger.' When the weather warms up, the Atfields will make full use of their summer room on the top of the house. It will be the perfect place for dinner parties, or simply sitting and watching the world go by as the sun sets. It's difficult not to watch the world outside from the house. The glass windows are fitted from floor to ceiling, and you are drawn to them. Standing at the edge makes you feel a little dizzy. 'I think some people have a thing about curtains and blinds,' says Geraldine. The only room in the house that has curtains is the couple's bedroom. 'I don't have a problem sitting in the kitchen at night, breast-feeding. I don't have a problem with privacy. Some people like to close out the world. I like to look out of the window and watch the world go by.' She is quick to point out that she is not an exhibitionist. And it's true, it would be crazy to block out the views outside. They are part of the house itself. Having all that open space outside makes the interior feel much more spacious and airy than it actually is. 'You watch people looking up at the house,' says Ben, who works as sales director at ePolitix.com, an online political information service. 'Before, it was a horrible hole in the wall. Now, at night, when it's lit up, it looks stunning. It's one of the most original, exciting domestic spaces to be built in London. Every floor is a room, and every room has a specific function.' The ground floor, which is raised up slightly to make it feel a bit more theatrical, serves as a utility space, with washing machine and dryer fitted into purpose-built alcoves. A stairway leads down into the basement, which is serving as a workroom until the house is properly finished. It has a shower and bathroom in it, so guests will be able to stay there, and it will also be a study. The first and second floors are also bedrooms, each with their own bath or shower rooms. Thomas's nursery already feels like home, with its cot and baby toys. The Gap might be a cool bit of modern architecture, but the baby, with all of his primary-coloured toys and equipment, prevents the place being at all precious. When he gets old enough to crawl, Geraldine says the house will become like 'the Which? Guide to safety gates'. But she is confident that the baby will adapt to the space quite easily. 'Kids have a natural sense of depth once they get used to moving,' she says. Above the bedrooms are the kitchen and dining room, and the living room, which has a bright and bold hanging on the outside wall of the lift shaft. 'We've done everything white now because we haven't had time to work out the colours yet,' says Geraldine. 'But I like white - particularly in a building like this.' The overall affect is both dramatic and homely at the same time. The limestone floors make it feel functional yet luxurious. And every millimetre of available space has been used. There are little alcoves set into the walls around the lift shaft for storage. The bathrooms are ingenious. Two are simply shower rooms, with Philippe Starck fittings and a lip in the limestone floor to stop the water flooding out; one has a bath actually set into the floor. 'It was complex to seal it up,' says Joe. It is made out of timber, and lined with fibreglass. The limestone was laid on top. The result is very Japanese. You have to step down into it, and it's deep enough for the water to support the bather's weight. For Thomas, it is like an Olympic swimming pool. Both Geraldine and Ben say they could never go back to open-plan loft living. 'When I bought the plot from Joe, it was a completely unique opportunity to create a new freehold building in the centre of London,' says Ben. As an investment, it has probably already doubled in price. 'You're always going to make money if you build properly,' says Joe, who walks past The Gap on his way to work from his Barbican apartment every morning, and when it is lit up in all its glory by night. 'I would like to be living here,' he says. 'It got too expensive, though. It would have swallowed everything for us to build. But I'm not as jealous as I thought I would be. What's been brilliant has been being able to build it. I'm an architect; I build things. Then, once it's done, you just move on to the next bit of theatre.' Close quarters Right now, Joe Hagan's three-person practice, USE, is concentrating on a bar in Greenwich called South Pole. It's below a pub called the North Pole. 'The design aesthetic is aircraft meets igloo,' says Joe, who also teaches one day a week at the South Bank University and DJs once a month downstairs at the Great Eastern Dining Rooms in Shoreditch. Hagan has recently started work on a penthouse extension with a garden in Old Street which he describes as 'Palm Springs comes to Old Street'. In May 2000, he completed the live/work showroom and headquarters ofstreetwear label Maharishi in Shoreditch, and redesigned the interior of a one-bedroom apartment for some neighbours in the Barbican. 'The budgets for these projects aren't vast,' he says. The Barbican interior - redesigned to provide office space under a mezzanine bed, as well as a pied-\u00e0-terre for a jet-set couple who have a warehouse in Belgium - was on a budget of \u00a330,000.

      "body": "<p>Sally Clarke's (124 Kensington Church Street, London W8; 020 7221 9225) savoury potato tartlets constitute one of the most satisfying wintery ways of eating the tuber. She cuts half centimetre slices of the Linzer Delicatesse variety, parboils them, and places them over a bed of sweated leeks or onions in a shortcut pastry case. A thyme-flavoured egg-and-cream mix is poured over, Gruy\u00e8re cheese is sprinkled on top, and the tartlets baked. Black truffle can also be added to the cream mix, and/or shaved over the ensemble for extra richness.</p> <p>The combination of potatoes with black truffle is long standing, not least in London W8, and works perfectly well in mash. Jason Atherton at L'Anis (1 Kensington High Street, London W8; 020 7795 6533) serves a creamy and finely pur\u00e9ed version mixed with pear and aromatised with tiny dice of black truffle, to accompany a large juicy rack of pink cooked pork topped with a thin silver foie gras.</p> <p>A chip butty is one of the easier carbohydrate-rich snacks to knock up, while a potato-topped pizza is not far behind.

      "bodyText": "Sally Clarke's (124 Kensington Church Street, London W8; 020 7221 9225) savoury potato tartlets constitute one of the most satisfying wintery ways of eating the tuber. She cuts half centimetre slices of the Linzer Delicatesse variety, parboils them, and places them over a bed of sweated leeks or onions in a shortcut pastry case. A thyme-flavoured egg-and-cream mix is poured over, Gruy\u00e8re cheese is sprinkled on top, and the tartlets baked. Black truffle can also be added to the cream mix, and/or shaved over the ensemble for extra richness. The combination of potatoes with black truffle is long standing, not least in London W8, and works perfectly well in mash. Jason Atherton at L'Anis (1 Kensington High Street, London W8; 020 7795 6533) serves a creamy and finely pur\u00e9ed version mixed with pear and aromatised with tiny dice of black truffle, to accompany a large juicy rack of pink cooked pork topped with a thin silver foie gras. A chip butty is one of the easier carbohydrate-rich snacks to knock up, while a potato-topped pizza is not far behind.

If everything stays the same, literally changeless, it becomes stagnant and hence lifeless. If everything changes before it has time to form a structure, it can take on no definable shape and becomes immaterial, nonexistent and hence lifeless. These two qualities are locked in an eternal embrace, sometimes nurturing, sometimes stultifying, sometimes passionate, sometimes coy.</p> <p>According to Taoists, womankind represents the yin, static, structive quality, and mankind the yang, dynamic quality. Moreover, there is a seed portion of yang in every woman, just as there is of yin in every man. Man meets a woman and falls under the spell of her 'aura' and she of his. Under this spell, colloquially known as 'falling in love' (falling being the operative word), the two weave a web of fantasies together - a business plan, if you like - and then commit more or less to its enactment, however ordinary or farfetched it may be, from trekking the Andes for four years to buying a house in Guildford. One 'hormonal phase' (three months) later, as the first cracks appear in the picture but they're both already hooked, she starts noticing things about him she wouldn't mind changing. If he's a rogue, she wants to change him into a family man. If he's a family man, she wants him to dress more like a rogue. If after a few more 'hormonal phases', he hasn't changed, she starts to grow impatient. This is the yang, dynamic quality within the woman seeking change according to its nature.</p> <p>The man, on the other hand, doesn't want her to change at all. And when, a few hormonal phases down the line, she comes to resemble someone entirely different from the girl he once knew, he becomes frightened. This is the yin, static quality in the man seeking things to remain as they were.</p> <p>Simultaneously, the yin, static quality within the woman, almost from the relationship's inception, begins weaving a structure around the man's comings and goings. He, Mr Yang, would rather things were randomised and spontaneous but always on tap (being a dynamic quality is thirsty work) and above all without restriction. She sees things in sequential patterns, forming part of a larger pattern (commonly known as matrimony and kids). She wants to create a structure in which to hold him, their relationship and the human fruit it produces, and yet within this structure requires that he changes. He wants to be free of structure once he gets home from work, yet requires her to remain the way she was the day he met her.</p> <p>Obviously, yin and yang, are relative. If two men are together (or two women), the one with more dynamic quality will be yang and the other one yin. And when the woman in a man-woman relationship is the dynamic partner, she will be the yang one and he the yin. We need each other, us yins and yangs, and yet we do seem to be making rather a muddle of our liaisons at this momentous time in history. And I just wonder if being able to abstract the dynamics of yin-yang, woman-man, by using this simplistic yet surprisingly evolved formula (considering it was devised well over five millennia back), we may create enough psychological distance to be able to stop taking the whole issue so personally, so we can all enjoy it a lot more. Because surely there can be nothing much nicer than the love, attachment, call it what you will, that passes between two people and leaves them feeling like Ian, no matter how upset it makes you afterwards.</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, Since I was 13 (I'm 37 now), I have chewed the sides of my mouth and I believe it's beginning to wear down my teeth. Can you advise me as to how to stop?<br><b> Anne Leahy, Poole</b></p> <p>Oral satisfaction levels, according to the Orientals, are under command of your spleen energy, which can be adjusted by a few acupuncture sessions. Boosting the spleen energy can reduce the compulsive need for oral gratification. Also, before sleep and on waking, gently stretch your face as long as it will go and relax, up to 18 times, to increase energy and blood circulation to the oral region. Apart from releasing accrued muscular stress, where there's sufficient energy, there's sufficient satisfaction, hence no need to chew. Hypnotherapy also can help reset that part of your mind that's bent on chewing you up and help you to relax, which is fundamental.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot, I've been suffering from boils on my upper back. As soon as one goes, another appears. I am under a lot of stress at the moment, but am having a weekly massage and do yoga to combat it. Any ideas?<br><b> Daniel Hassan, by email</b></p> <p>By the tenets of Oriental medicine, the organs involved (in maintaining the skin) are the lungs and colon, but boils also appear when the blood is impure, in which case treatment needs to directed at the liver, for which acupuncture might help. A well-used traditional Chinese remedy is to put a poultice of baked onions on the boil, bandage and leave overnight to draw out the poison. This is combined with a juice concoction to cleanse colon and lung 'chi': a half pint of equal amounts of carrot, raw beetroot, spinach and cucumber. Also try the Bach Flower remedy of mustard, which helps with the tendency to suddenly flare up.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have any problems you would like answered, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer , 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email him at <a href=\"mailto:barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk</a>.

Also, before sleep and on waking, gently stretch your face as long as it will go and relax, up to 18 times, to increase energy and blood circulation to the oral region. Apart from releasing accrued muscular stress, where there's sufficient energy, there's sufficient satisfaction, hence no need to chew. Hypnotherapy also can help reset that part of your mind that's bent on chewing you up and help you to relax, which is fundamental. Dear Barefoot, I've been suffering from boils on my upper back. As soon as one goes, another appears. I am under a lot of stress at the moment, but am having a weekly massage and do yoga to combat it. Any ideas? Daniel Hassan, by email By the tenets of Oriental medicine, the organs involved (in maintaining the skin) are the lungs and colon, but boils also appear when the blood is impure, in which case treatment needs to directed at the liver, for which acupuncture might help. A well-used traditional Chinese remedy is to put a poultice of baked onions on the boil, bandage and leave overnight to draw out the poison. This is combined with a juice concoction to cleanse colon and lung 'chi': a half pint of equal amounts of carrot, raw beetroot, spinach and cucumber. Also try the Bach Flower remedy of mustard, which helps with the tendency to suddenly flare up. \u0095 If you have any problems you would like answered, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer , 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email him at barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk.

      "bodyText": "Armed with just a handful of Petri dishes, artist Rachel Chapman heads out on to the streets to capture a blast of the fungi-filled air that is all around us. Her aim, she explains, is 'to make visible the breath of the city' by combining art and science. Back in her lab, Chapman examines her catch which has taken root in the dishes, and then, with the help of two mycologists, chooses the fungi she wants for her larger canvas: a giant Petri dish which will give the spores a chance to really take off. Breathe , the resulting work, is part of the Growth &amp; Form exhibition at the Wellcome Trust in London, which is showing art inspired by the world of medical research, alongside the Biomedical Image Awards for 2001. The stunning biomedical images are all the result of medical research carried out in the past year. Nerve cells, proteins and a growing eye are brought to life with the help of fluorescent dyes and beams of light and electrons. A developing nervous system shows off its burgeoning internal skeletons, dramatically highlighted with ultramarine, luminous green and a poppy red, while a microscopic close-up of a protein gives the impression of being a riotous field filled with long grasses and electric-blue cornflowers. The art world's fascination with science goes right back to Da Vinci, D\u00fcrer and Michelangelo, who all delved deep below the skin's surface to reveal the body's inner structures, but today's technology obviously allows artists and science photographers to dig even deeper in their efforts to make the invisible visible, which in this instance produces eye-opening results. \u0095 Growth &amp; Form is at the Two10 Gallery, 210 Euston Road, London NW1 (020 7611 7211), from 22 February to 4 May, Monday to Friday, 9am-6pm.",

She is now certain to play a key role in federal elections later this year.</p> <p>Prime Minister John Howard's conservatives were put to the sword in Queensland, the country's second largest state, by voters angered by free-market reforms that have hurt the countryside and a new 10 per cent tax on goods and services.</p> <p>The conservative vote splintered among smaller parties - including Hanson's One Nation party, which opposes Asian immigration and Aboriginal rights - producing a Labor landslide.</p> <p>Early results suggested that Queensland's Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, would return to power with up to 70 of the state parliament's 89 seats after a 10 per cent swing.</p> <p>Howard's Liberal Party appeared to have won only three seats while the National Party - in Queensland the stronger of the two parties which form the federal coalition - was set to win around 12.</p> <p>National Party candidate Rob Borbidge rapidly conceded defeat. 'It's a significant victory by any standards,' Borbidge said, acknowledging that federal coalition policies had played a role in Labor's crushing victory and One Nation's resurgence.</p> <p>One Nation stood in only half the districts in Queensland, and got an average vote of 21 per cent. This was expected to give it at least three seats.</p> <p>That was down from the 11 it won in the last state poll in 1998. But soon afterwards One Nation imploded when its MPs deserted to form the City-Country Alliance or to stand as independents.

      "bodyText": "Back from the political wilderness in a blaze of floral frocks and bilious soundbites, the former fish-and-chip shop owner Pauline Hanson and her right-wing party yesterday helped to deliver a devastating blow to Australia's ruling coalition. She is now certain to play a key role in federal elections later this year. Prime Minister John Howard's conservatives were put to the sword in Queensland, the country's second largest state, by voters angered by free-market reforms that have hurt the countryside and a new 10 per cent tax on goods and services. The conservative vote splintered among smaller parties - including Hanson's One Nation party, which opposes Asian immigration and Aboriginal rights - producing a Labor landslide. Early results suggested that Queensland's Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, would return to power with up to 70 of the state parliament's 89 seats after a 10 per cent swing. Howard's Liberal Party appeared to have won only three seats while the National Party - in Queensland the stronger of the two parties which form the federal coalition - was set to win around 12. National Party candidate Rob Borbidge rapidly conceded defeat. 'It's a significant victory by any standards,' Borbidge said, acknowledging that federal coalition policies had played a role in Labor's crushing victory and One Nation's resurgence. One Nation stood in only half the districts in Queensland, and got an average vote of 21 per cent. This was expected to give it at least three seats. That was down from the 11 it won in the last state poll in 1998. But soon afterwards One Nation imploded when its MPs deserted to form the City-Country Alliance or to stand as independents. One committed suicide. Yesterday's results represented a powerful comeback. It underscored the party's role in the next federal election, expected to be called by November. Last weekend it won 10 per cent in a state vote in Western Australia. Hanson said that the vote was 'telling them people are not happy. This is a clear message to John Howard. People do not want the GST [tax], people do not want higher fuel prices and they certainly didn't want the deregulation of the dairy industry'. Hanson skilfully exploited the system of proportional representation, which asks voters to list candidates in order of preference. She campaigned hard in staunch conservative areas, urging voters to put sitting members last. As a result, the mainstream right-wing parties have been hit hard. She hopes to exploit the preferential voting system in the federal elections to unseat the ruling coalition. Protesters in central Brisbane burned an effigy of Hanson outside the state's largest polling station. 'Pauline Hanson is igniting racism in Australia, so we are going to ignite racism,' said Action Against Racism protester David Charlton. Hanson's policies appeal to prejudice rather than reason. Her party's flimsy policy document comprises just 18 pages of beliefs including mandatory capital punishment for drug traffickers and serial killers, a basic right to possess and use firearms, and a call to halt the giving over of land to native Aboriginals. She also wants to send back the thousands of boat people who arrive on Australia's shores every year.",

      "body": "<p>In the hills of western Sicily, among the sheep, citrus trees, olive groves and palm dates, an old man is waiting for winter to end. They say he is broad and paunchy, but still strong. Sometimes wind catches the wisps of white hair on either side of his head.</p> <p>Spring is on its way but the nights are bitter. Shepherds say the cold gets into your bones. From some peaks you can look down on the Mediterranean and see the gulls swooping on ships. Fields covered in snow would swallow up whitewashed farmhouses were it not for their black window frames.</p> <p>In the stillness footsteps crunch on snow. They say the old man is sick but that his ears are as sharp as ever. They need to be. Bernardo Provenzano is a hunted man. Hundreds of police officers are searching the territory. Behind every bend lurks a potential patrol, road-block or hidden camera. Behind every friend's smile lurks potential treachery. Behind every decision lurks the risk that this will be the mistake, the misjudgment, that costs his liberty. Generations of policemen have come and gone waiting for that mistake.</p> <p>Provenzano, Italy's most wanted man, the Mafia's legendary boss of bosses, has been on the run for 38 years. His is one of the great fugitive stories of our time. The state has mobilised elite units, recruited dozens of informers, bought the best technology, and still, against all the odds, he remains free. The most recent photograph is from 1959: a chunky, open-faced youngster with brilliantined hair, a grave expression and wearing a suit. A computer-generated Identikit of the 68-year-old has been constructed with the help of informers, but its accuracy is dubious.</p> <p>Disdaining South America or Spain's Costa del Crime, Provenzano remains in Sicily. He is somewhere in the interior between Palermo and Trapani, a distance shorter than London and Dover. Not for long, perhaps. Breezing through the prosecutor's office in Palermo is an air of giddiness, for the noose is tightening. Last month Provenzano's lieutenant, Benedetto Spera, was arrested in a farmhouse along with Vincenzo Di Noto, a prominent doctor suspected of treating both mobsters.</p> <p>Last week came another breakthrough. The police announced they had intercepted four letters to the godfather at Mezzojuso, a town 25 miles from Palermo. Handwritten by his wife Saveria, two sons, Angelo, 24, and Paolo, 20, and his younger brother, also called Angelo, tantalising clues were buried amid gossip about business, health and advice to wash socks in cold water.</p> <p>To the rest of the world he may be known as 'Tractor' for mowing down his opponents, but to Saveria he is 'my beloved sweetheart'. Angelo sought advice about buying land on the outskirts of Corleone which his father did not like - suggesting Provenzano had seen it.</p> <p>What intrigued investigators most was Saveria's reference to sending on a fleecy jacket and snow trousers that her husband had requested. Hills near Agrigento and Mount Cammarata were immediately searched. Of the Scarlet Pimpernel there was no trace, but some police officers felt they were close enough almost to touch. At stake is more than one man's fate. Mafia mythology and media fictions encrust much of Cosa Nostra but two things are certain. The boss of bosses, the capo di capi , wields enormous power. And Provenzano is that boss. From his hilltop shacks and city bolt holes he controls a vast empire of racketeering, drug-running, extortion, fraud and corruption. He took control when Sicily's Mafia was reeling from a state crackdown and rebuilt it.</p> <p>From the top down Cosa Nostra is a new organisation, more cautious, quieter, less violent, but just as formidable and ambitious. One of the hugest scams of all is being planned. The state has waged its credibility on capturing Provenzano. Every day of his liberty is a defiance. Secret negotiations are under way with jailed mobsters to bring him down.</p> <p>His story could start on 31 January 1933, when he was born to peasant parents in Corleone, a dirt-poor town about 40 miles south of Palermo. Perhaps a better place to begin is the day in 1958 when 112 bullets were pumped into the car of Corleone's godfather, Michele Navarra. Among those pulling the triggers were the rising men of honour, Toto Riina and Provenzano. A five-year war of extermination between rival factions followed, with more than 140 corpses and countless missing. Amid the mayhem the Tractor turned fugitive but emerged in the 1970s to rival Riina for leadership of Cosa Nostra's ruling executive, the cupoloa , after Luciano Liggio retired. Provenzano was an excellent hit-man, but was mocked by Liggio: 'Shoots like an angel but he's got the brains of a chicken.' Liggio's mistake.</p> <p>Riina masked a psychotic personality behind charm and persuaded rival families from the capital, Palermo, to allow him to assume leadership. Their mistake. He unleashed another murderous war in the 1980s, eliminating more than 800 mobsters until the Corleone clan was dominant. Provenzano became his deputy.</p> <p>Riina rewrote the rulebook by attacking rather than collaborating with the state. Judges were blown up, policemen shot, historic monuments targeted. The Mafia was catapulted from the shadows. Riina's mistake. From 1993 the state hit back with troops, new laws and supergrasses. Riina himself was caught the same year and now languishes in solitary confinement. He is the Mafia's honorary president: entitled to advise and consult but not to give orders. That power passed to his deputy.</p> <p>At this stage Provenzano had become a near-mythical figure. Unseen for decades, many thought he was dead. 'In truth he was just very good at running,' said one retired prosecutor. Obsessed with precautions, obedient to instinct, comrades described him as almost a wild animal.</p> <p>Or a ghost. He flits from hideout to hideout. He sets up meetings but does not turn up, sends delegates instead, turns up only when not expected. He shuns telephones and uses written notes. Colleagues are not supposed to see him more than three times. 'We suspect he hasn't seen his kids in nine years,' said the prosecutor. Provenzano's greatest assets are knowledge of the terrain and tacit support in villages and hamlets. Police cannot move without being spotted. 'The grapevine moves faster than any vehicle,' said Francesco La Licata, a journalist and author on the Mafia.</p> <p>Provenzano is suspected of having informants at senior levels, as well as friends among Sicily's left-wing politicians. He has success fully steered the Mafia through a seven-year crackdown. He abandoned the cupolua executive in favour of a tighter regime. Sicily was divided into four, each with one commissioner who reports only to him.</p> <p>More importantly, he has ended the high-profile terrorism which backfired so spectacularly on Riina. Under Provenzano the Mafia has returned to its roots: extortion, racketeering, electronic fraud, quiet deals with corrupt politicians and businessmen. His fingerprints were said to be all over a foiled plot to create a virtual bank teller to ransack Sicily's coffers last October.</p> <p>Supergrasses speak of him as the tugboat that towed the organisation to safety. The biggest scam is yet to come, according to Lucio Violante, speaker of the Senate. 'He is the heart of the problem. In the next six years there will be \u00a35.3 billion invested in the Sicilian region. Do we want a Sicily in which the economic power ends up in the hands of Cosa Nostra?'</p> <p>Secretly, the state is trying another tactic. Mobsters jailed for life under the harsh so-called Bis 41 regime are desperate for better conditions. Pier Luigi Vigna, Italy's national anti-Mafia prosecutor, denied reports that the state is working on a deal but one plan has been floated. The godfathers get out of isolation units - and they deliver Provenzano. Old and ailing, he is no longer indispensable. No deal has been concluded, but two options being considered are that he gives himself up or is betrayed. Salvatore Lo Piccolo, the commissioner he appointed to look after the region between Palermo and Trapani, is being groomed to become the next capo di capi .</p>",

The action is the latest in a series of assaults on journalists, judges and opposition politicians. The government yesterday revoked the work permits of Joseph Winter, correspondent for the BBC African Service, and Mercedes Sayagues, correspondent for the South African paper the Weekly Mail and Guardian. No reason was given except that they were journalists. Ms Sayagues was on business in South Africa and returned to Harare yesterday. Immigration officials initially refused to let her enter Zimbabwe but she pleaded to be allowed to be reunited with her nine-year-old daughter and so was given 24 hours to wind up her affairs and quit the country. 'As a journalist I have been reporting on human rights abuses and the general breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe. The action taken against me is small compared to those Zimbabweans who have been murdered, tortured and beaten,' said a defiant Ms Sayagues. The two journalists are taking urgent legal action against their expulsion, but are expected to leave Zimbabwe later today. Supporters of the Mugabe government have already beaten and threatened Zimbabwean journalists and earlier this month the printing press of the independent Daily News was destroyed in a massive bomb blast. In the past week the government has threatened Supreme Court judges, arrested opposition politicians on spurious charges and sent army troops into Harare's townships to beat residents at random. Three hundred of Mr Mugabe's war veterans invaded the Supreme Court and forced the five judges to flee. The judges have received death threats. Supreme Court Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay succumbed to the pressure and resigned. But the other Supreme Court judges are making a stand against the government. Justice Nick McNally refused to accept early retirement. Justices Wilson Sandura and Simbarashe Muchechetere refused to meet with Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa. Zimbabwe's Supreme Court has been admirably independent and in December issued carefully considered reversals to Mr Mugabe's 'fast track' land seizures, ordering police to remove thousands of Mr Mugabe's supporters from lands they were illegally occupying. In January the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional Mr Mugabe's amendment to the Electoral Act which stated that no legal challenge could be made to the results of parliamentary elections.

'We will become a banana republic without any bananas,' says cosmonaut Georgy Grechko, who blames the US for engineering the death of Mir and Russia's space programme. 'America will siphon off a few hundred of our best specialists, but some 100,000 will be out of work.' </p> <p>It costs \u00a3150 million a year to keep Mir in orbit, a price Russia can no longer afford if it is to participate in the US-led International Space Station now being constructed above Earth. Hence Putin's decision to axe the craft that has been dubbed Starship Lada by the West, but which is seen as '130 tonnes of intellectual metal' by his countrymen. </p> <p>A poll last week revealed that 67 per cent of Russians oppose the destruction of Mir. A letter signed by former cosmonauts and rocket scientists and 16,000 Muscovites has been handed to Putin. It claims Mir's death sentence is 'anti-Russian'. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the fifteenth anniversary of Mir's launch, thousands of demonstrators are expected to protest about its fate, and feelings will run high. According to the left-wing daily Soviet Russia , the government is planning 'the killing of a living organism'. </p> <p>The West may recall the station's worst year in 1997 when a fire and then a collision with a cargo spaceship nearly destroyed Mir, but Russians prefer to remember its other 14 years of success. Nor could the timing of Mir's end be worse, for it has coincided with the election of a US administration committed to the development of a sophisticated star wars defence programme. </p> <p>'Russia's space programme is being destroyed,' says Vyacheslav Tetekin, leader of the Save Mir campaign. 'America has squeezed everything they needed and now they are ditching our specialists like unnecessary ballast.' </p> <p>Such protests are understandable, but ignore a basic fact: that the 40ft-long space ship, whose bristling solar panels give it the appearance of a railway carriage with wings, can no longer function safely. </p> <p>'The technology is outdated, and we don't have money for repairs,' says space agency official Alexei Gorbunov. </p> <p>Worst of all, Mir's giant gyros are broken and the craft can only hold its position in space by using its thruster rockets, which burn fuel at an alarming rate. Two months ago, engineers at Star City announced they had had enough. 'We cannot continue with this game - which I call Russian roulette,' said one. </p> <p>An unmanned Progress spacecraft carrying fuel was launched and docked with Mir a couple of weeks ago. 'Now all the Russians have to do is let the craft sink of its own accord until it reaches a critical height of 250 kilome tres,' said Richard Crowther of the British National Space Centre. 'It now orbits at 280km but is dropping by more than a kilometre a day.' </p> <p>Once it has reached 250km, Star City engineers will fire the Progress capsule's rockets, causing Mir to slow down rapidly, and plunge into the atmosphere. This final burn will be timed precisely to allow Mir to make a last sweep over Asia before plummeting into the Pacific. </p> <p>'In the past, 25 to 30 per cent of large spaceships survive re-entry,' said Crowther. 'We can therefore expect that about 35 tonnes worth of Mir will still hit Earth - at about 120mph - though not in one lump. There should be a spray of bits and pieces that will fall into the sea.' </p> <p>Mir should have reached its 250km re-entry height by now, but has been saved by - of all things - the sun. 'We are going through an intense period of solar activity called the Solar Max which heats up the upper atmosphere, causing it to rise and drag on Mir and thus slow it down,' said Crowther. </p> <p>'But for some mysterious reason that activity stopped a few weeks ago. The drag on Mir has been reduced, and this has extended its life.' </p> <p>The sun's intervention has therefore given Mir an unexpected stay of execution, but not one that will soothe the feelings of the spaceship's millions of Russian fans.</p>",

We may find Nabokov's brutal honesty unpalatable - but unless we recognise that we have constructed an environment that draws out the Humbert Humbert in all of us, we risk promoting the very evil we are so eager to denounce. There may never have been a time when children enjoyed the untroubled innocence we like to think of as their domain; but must we drag them, made up and tarted up, into a dangerous and premature adulthood?",

Not only are they attractive businesses in their own right, they also confirm that, now the distractions of the Granada deal are over, Compass will continue its job of building a global food service - the current jargon for catering - empire. </p> <p>The two deals do a lot to further that ambition. The first, Morrison Management Specialists, is the second biggest caterer to the healthcare and retirement market in the US. That takes Compass into hospitals and also greatly increases its presence in the fast-growing retirement home market. </p> <p>The second deal was to bring its 33 per cent stake in Selecta, the European vending machine business, up to 100 per cent. Michael Bailey, Compass's chief executive, believes that much of the growth in its US business has come from providing vending machines that employees can use when canteens are closed. </p> <p>Combining the two services is already common in the US, and Europe is starting to move along that route. Taking control of Selecta, which has contracts in 15 European countries, will help Compass take advantage of that. The deals also go some way to restoring Compass's status as an international business. Before the Granada swap, just 17 per cent of its sales were in the UK. Add in Granada's Sutcliffe catering operations, motorway service stations and Little Chef, and the proportion rose to 37 per cent - and more than 60 per cent of its profits. </p> <p>A few more add-on deals like these will help redress that balance. And it will have plenty of firepower once it has sold Granada's hotel business, which it is still promising to do by the end of March. </p> <p>That will leave the roadside services as the key area of concern in new Compass. Investors were anxious about Compass taking them on - they are busy, messy, expensive and unpleasant to use. In investment terms, that translates into low growth and poor margins. </p> <p>Compass is confident that it can improve this performance, through measures such as using its branded catering operations - Upper Crust, say - in service stations. The City has yet to be convinced. While it waits, however, there is the prospect of a promised \u00a370 million of cost savings. </p> <p>The City is starting to forgive Compass for the Granada deal. Its shares have risen from 482p when they started trading in the new form, to 565p in just two weeks, although that is still some way from the premium rating they used to enjoy. Sentiment should improve further when the sale of the hotels is completed. In the meantime, buy. </p> <p><strong> Not a minute to wait</strong><br> </p> <p> Isn't lastminute.com a wonderful idea? We all like to think of ourselves as impulsive and adventurous. It was very clever of Martha Lane Fox and Brent Hoberman to think of an internet site which panders to that. </p> <p>But clever ideas do not always translate into clever investments.Take the first-quarter results. Critics made great play of the fact that subscriber numbers were static but, with 2.9 million people already signed up to the site, growth was always going to be slow. As Hoberman points out, the more important thing is what the subscribers do with the newsletters they get. Now that most of its subscribers have been transferred to the jazzy version, complete with graphics and - crucially - other people's adverts, an impressive 7 per cent of them actually clicked on those adverts and signed on to the sites. </p> <p>That means money for lastminute.com. More of its subscribers are also buying from the site. In the three months to December, the number of customers, as a proportion of subscribers, rose from 5.5 to 8.9 per cent. </p> <p>But look at what it cost to get there. In the third quarter it spent \u00a37.2m on sales and marketing alone, then there is the \u00a38m paid out for product development and admin. In total, its costs were almost seven times its \u00a32.9m turnover. As Hoberman points out, sales and marketing spend per customer is falling but, at \u00a392 per customer in the three months to December, it is still astronomical. </p> <p>All new businesses have to spend heavily to establish themselves. The problem is, lastminute's revenues are so small - a large proportion of the \u00a32.9m turnover was from advertising, not commissions - and its costs so high, it takes a great leap of faith to see the profits emerging. </p> <p>The share price says they will. Although the shares have fallen from a high of 550p to just 65p, that still represents \u00a3470 for every customer who has bought from it since inception, or almost \u00a350 per newsletter subscriber. On the heroic assumption that turnover doubles every quarter this year, the market value would still be almost three times sales. That is much too expensive. Sell your shares now. </p> <p><strong> Still in the rinse cycle</strong><br> </p> <p> Don't fight the Fed, goes the old adage, and the markets have taken it to heart. Nasdaq, in particular, has soared since Alan Greenspan made his first rate cut at the beginning of January and is now 11 per cent ahead of its low for the year. </p> <p>The theory is simple. Interest-rate cuts are good for shares, and cyclical stocks in particular, so they tend to rise first. In practice, however, investors spent much of last year persuading themselves that technology stocks were not cyclical, so it seems perverse to be buying them on the back of a cyclical rally. </p> <p>Second, and more important, the blind rush into technology ignores the damage last year's boom did. Investment was accelerated on the assumption that the good times would go on for ever, stocks and borrowings to fund the stock increases are both unhealthily high. </p> <p>That is worrying for two reasons. First, unwinding the stock positions will keep production, and hence demand for raw materials, low for some time - a vicious circle. Second, banks are becoming nervous about debt levels so companies could be forced to tap stock markets for funds, as the telecoms companies are doing. A flood of new shares on to the market is hardly conducive to roaring prices. </p> <p>Michael Taylor, head of institutional investment at Threadneedle, thinks Nasdaq could have 30 per cent to fall. At best, it will go nowhere for 18 months. </p> <p>It is too early to buy into tech recovery.</p>",

Interest-rate cuts are good for shares, and cyclical stocks in particular, so they tend to rise first. In practice, however, investors spent much of last year persuading themselves that technology stocks were not cyclical, so it seems perverse to be buying them on the back of a cyclical rally. Second, and more important, the blind rush into technology ignores the damage last year's boom did. Investment was accelerated on the assumption that the good times would go on for ever, stocks and borrowings to fund the stock increases are both unhealthily high. That is worrying for two reasons. First, unwinding the stock positions will keep production, and hence demand for raw materials, low for some time - a vicious circle. Second, banks are becoming nervous about debt levels so companies could be forced to tap stock markets for funds, as the telecoms companies are doing. A flood of new shares on to the market is hardly conducive to roaring prices. Michael Taylor, head of institutional investment at Threadneedle, thinks Nasdaq could have 30 per cent to fall. At best, it will go nowhere for 18 months. It is too early to buy into tech recovery.",

Ten years ago, the high street banks were piling into investment banking. Five years ago, they were queueing up to buy building societies and fund managers. Today, despite Credit Suisse's decision to pull out of the market, the holy grail for the retail banks is wealth management. </p> <p>Abbey National, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays - you name it, they are all setting up wealth management services. All have one aim: to make money from advising the so-called 'mass affluent' on investing their money. </p> <p>Wealth management is nothing new. Companies such as Coutts, the Queen's bankers, and Hoare &amp; Co have been doing it for years, but they call it private banking. What is new is the number of companies keen to jump on the private banking bandwagon. </p> <p>The growth is being driven by two key factors. First, more and more of us are getting rich - through inheritance and the increase in the value of private businesses. Abbey National estimates that more than 4 million people in Britain have at least \u00a350,000, excluding the value of their houses, to invest; Lloyds TSB predicts that number will grow by at least 10 per cent a year. </p> <p>The second driver is technology. The growth of telephone and internet-based services means that companies can now offer quite sophisticated advice relatively cheaply. And that means banks are able to offer services that were once the province of the seriously rich to the moderately affluent. </p> <p>In what Huw van Steenis, an analyst at J P Morgan, calls the'skinny bricks and clicks' approach, banks will have real centres - Lloyds TSB will have 31, Abbey National six - but much of the admin will be done over the phone or internet. Significantly, however, most of those who were planning an internet-only service - like JP Morgan itself - are retrenching. Abbey National says its research showed that customers thinking of handing over more than \u00a350,000 of their savings wanted to meet the recipient face to face. </p> <p>Providing the services may be cheap, setting them up is not. Lloyds TSB spent \u00a336 million last year and will invest a further \u00a3100m this year in its Create service; HSBC and Merrill Lynch are investing $1 billion between them setting up an international service targeting the mass affluent - the UK launch is due in the spring. And it is not just British banks that are doing it; virtually every European and US bank worth its salt has some sort of wealth management strategy. </p> <p>Some are very ambitious - Deutsche Bank is seeking 1 million customers by the end of 2004. Merrill Lynch-HSBC has not enunciated targets but it will need high take-up rates to justify its investment. </p> <p>If the history of banking is anything to go by, not all will make a decent return on their investment. JP Morgan's van Steenis expects only between six and 12 players to make 'serious money, long-term'. Given the amount of activity globally, that will mean major fall-out. Currently, there are 40 online brokerages, for example: that number must surely fall. ' </p> <p>He refuses to predict who will win out. But he says that, on paper, the plans by Merrill Lynch HSBC look promising. Putting together one of the biggest, most international retail banks and a leading US investment bank is a powerful combination. </p> <p>'Bringing products that were formerly the province of the institutional market to the retail is every investment banker's dream,' said van Steenis. In the US, the revolution in brokerage came when Merrill Lynch launched CMAs - cash management accounts. These combine cheque accounts with securities dealing, mutual funds and other investment services. Similar accounts have taken Australia by storm - 72 per cent of all mutual fund sales (similar to our unit trusts) were made into such accounts. </p> <p>Here, we have been slow to follow. Woolwich's Open Plan system - which Barclays found so attractive it decided to buy it - is supposed to be similar but is based around mortgages, rather than investments. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch's product promises to be similar to a CMA. Already, customers can sign up to receive company research reports from HSBC and Merrill Lynch analysts. When the product is launched, it will add an online dealing facility, cheque account in various currencies - with access to link cash machines - and high-interest savings accounts. It will, says Merrill Lynch HSBC, be 'a single on-screen place to manage your shares and money online'. </p> <p>Others are seeking to emulate this service. Lloyds TSB's Create, for example, has teamed up with Goldman Sachs to provide broking services; Barclays is working towards combining its Premier Banking clients, aimed at those earning \u00a360,000 or more, with Barclays Stockbrokers; Abbey National's Inscape will provide one statement showing all the various parts of the account. </p> <p>'The advent of the omnibus account will transform the market,' said van Steenis. 'I doubt it will be the only winner, but it will send ripples everywhere.' </p> <p>Ironically, all Britain's retail banks have had the ability to offer wealth management services for years - Barclays, for example, made \u00a3500m profit from it last year, Lloyds TSB makes about \u00a3300m. The problem has been persuading us to use them. </p> <p>Laurel Powers-Freeling, managing director of wealth management at Lloyds TSB, said: 'If you look at our existing customer base, we have got 1 million people who qualify for wealth management on our definition (those earning more than \u00a360,000, or with liquid assets of at least \u00a3100,000). But we only serve 40,000. That is because the offer we have in place does not appeal to them.' </p> <p>Certainly, banks' investment products have generally been poor. That is why Barclays has agreed to sell Legal &amp; General branded products, instead of its own. It also explains why Abbey's Inscape will use the best fund managers - Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Schroders among them - as well as its own. Combine that with the fact that, when we go into branches, we are usually met with long queues and indifferent services and it is hardly surprising that our local bank branch is not the first place most of us think of when we find ourselves with \u00a350,000 lying around doing nothing. </p> <p>Will relaunches, rebrands and fancy names make any difference? It will be at least five years before that is clear, but their record suggests it is more likely the winners will be American or European. </p> <p>Where does all this activity leave the traditional private banks? </p> <p>Largely unperturbed, judging by the reaction of Ray Entwistle of Adam &amp; Company, the Edinburgh-based private bank owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. 'Already in banking, a lot of people are fed up with the service they get from their banks. If you go into your branch, someone just wants to sell you something. </p> <p>'The interesting thing to us is that Hoare &amp; Co and ourselves are the only private banks where the focus is on service, not sale of products.'</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When it comes to upper-crust Asians in Britain, Karan Bilimoria is one of the most pukka. </p> <p>The 39-year-old is managing director of Cobra Beer ('the Indian beer'), one of the UK's fastest-growing companies. A Sunday newspaper described him as one of a new generation of Asians 'who have swapped the corner shop for the high street', but there is nothing remotely corner shop about the former captain of the Cambridge University polo team. </p> <p>Indeed, when he first started Cobra back in 1990, he was so far removed from the economic sharp end that he confesses to have been caught out by the slowdown: 'The recession started, but I hadn't realised at the time. We had a lot of problems.' </p> <p>Bilimoria met The Observer at an upmarket Indian restaurant near his offices in Fulham, south-west London. His father was commander-in-chief of the Indian army. And Bilimoria's measured demeanour suggests nothing less than an upbringing in keeping with the 'more British than the British' Indian military. Tally ho and it's polo sticks at dawn. </p> <p>And polo was at the dawn of Bilimoria's career: he earned his entrepreneurial spurs selling Indian-made polo sticks. </p> <p>Born in the south Indian city of Hyderabad - the home of Mughal cuisine such as the biryani - Bilimoria moved to Britain at the age of 19. He trained as a chartered accountant at Ernst &amp; Young, but his Indian qualifications were not recognised here so he had to study for two extra years. 'It was highly unfair,' he says. </p> <p>Still, he went on to study law at Cambridge University, and he constantly sings the praises of the institution and his time there. </p> <p>A former captain of a winning Blues polo team, he still retains some of the rivalry with Oxford. He is unequivocal about Cambridge's Judge Institute of Management Studies. </p> <p>'It's far ahead of the Said - are they even in their own premises yet?' he says of Oxford University's business school. </p> <p>After Cambridge he began importing those polo sticks from India for sale in Harrods and Lilywhites, transporting the first batches in his battered Citro\u00ebn 2CV. </p> <p>He had a clear strategy. </p> <p>'I tried to see where I could add value, for example, by being a bridge between India and the UK,' he said. 'My big idea was beer. When I started at university I hated lager. It was too fizzy and too gassy to drink and I acquired a taste for real ale. But ale doesn't go with Indian food. Instead, I used to empty two bottles of pilsner into my pint glass.' </p> <p>At the same time there was a revolution in British eating habits. 'I saw Indian food get more and more popular between 1980 and 1990,' says Bilimoria. The number of Indian restaurants in Britain increased from 3,000 to 8,000 over this period, he says. </p> <p>Then a chance meeting with the brewer of choice for the Indian army led to the development of Cobra beer, a deliberately less gassy, smoother lager.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to upper-crust Asians in Britain, Karan Bilimoria is one of the most pukka. The 39-year-old is managing director of Cobra Beer ('the Indian beer'), one of the UK's fastest-growing companies. A Sunday newspaper described him as one of a new generation of Asians 'who have swapped the corner shop for the high street', but there is nothing remotely corner shop about the former captain of the Cambridge University polo team. Indeed, when he first started Cobra back in 1990, he was so far removed from the economic sharp end that he confesses to have been caught out by the slowdown: 'The recession started, but I hadn't realised at the time. We had a lot of problems.' Bilimoria met The Observer at an upmarket Indian restaurant near his offices in Fulham, south-west London. His father was commander-in-chief of the Indian army. And Bilimoria's measured demeanour suggests nothing less than an upbringing in keeping with the 'more British than the British' Indian military. Tally ho and it's polo sticks at dawn. And polo was at the dawn of Bilimoria's career: he earned his entrepreneurial spurs selling Indian-made polo sticks. Born in the south Indian city of Hyderabad - the home of Mughal cuisine such as the biryani - Bilimoria moved to Britain at the age of 19. He trained as a chartered accountant at Ernst &amp; Young, but his Indian qualifications were not recognised here so he had to study for two extra years. 'It was highly unfair,' he says. Still, he went on to study law at Cambridge University, and he constantly sings the praises of the institution and his time there. A former captain of a winning Blues polo team, he still retains some of the rivalry with Oxford. He is unequivocal about Cambridge's Judge Institute of Management Studies. 'It's far ahead of the Said - are they even in their own premises yet?' he says of Oxford University's business school. After Cambridge he began importing those polo sticks from India for sale in Harrods and Lilywhites, transporting the first batches in his battered Citro\u00ebn 2CV. He had a clear strategy. 'I tried to see where I could add value, for example, by being a bridge between India and the UK,' he said. 'My big idea was beer. When I started at university I hated lager. It was too fizzy and too gassy to drink and I acquired a taste for real ale. But ale doesn't go with Indian food. Instead, I used to empty two bottles of pilsner into my pint glass.' At the same time there was a revolution in British eating habits. 'I saw Indian food get more and more popular between 1980 and 1990,' says Bilimoria. The number of Indian restaurants in Britain increased from 3,000 to 8,000 over this period, he says. Then a chance meeting with the brewer of choice for the Indian army led to the development of Cobra beer, a deliberately less gassy, smoother lager. It was to be brewed in Bangalore, then more famous for its beer than its software specialists. Branding, marketing and all sales were in the UK. Bilimoria literally travelled from restaurant to restaurant and grocer to grocer to promote Cobra. It took five years for revenue to hit the \u00a31 million mark. Another five years on, it is approaching \u00a310m, and grew by 65 per cent over the last year. Looking around the restaurant as the well-heeled Kings Road set gathers for lunch, it is clear that Cobra is a craze. Every table of businessmen has a clutch of the giant 660ml bottles of the lager. Crucially for Bilimoria, the clientele are somewhat more generous about sharing their drink than the average pubgoer. He says: 'We've changed the territoriality of beer - it's the way beer is drunk over there [in India].' But is Cobra very Indian? It has never been sold there, and brewing shifted from Bangalore in 1997 to Charles May in Bedford, Britain's largest independent brewer. Says Bilimoria: 'I never wanted it to be sold in India. If I had released it there, getting hold of supply would have been difficult.' The only real Indian connections are Bilimoria's origins and the recipe. Such claims have attracted scorn from the likes of Kingfisher, a popular Indian beer brewed under licence by Shepherd Neame - in Faversham. Perhaps it's a measure of multicultural Britain that two English brewers are fighting over which of their products is more 'Indian' in the belief that such authenticity would offer greater appeal to the British public. But can Cobra go mass-market without breaking its umbilical link to curry? Marketing centred around 'Curryholic Dave' has won plaudits. A sustained advertising onslaught will be required for growth to continue until an expected flotation in April 2002. Cobra is on the hunt to fund an expansion in its 22 export markets.

This relationship has been cemented with e-commerce ventures such as the curryzone.co.uk site and publishing. 'Everybody eats curry, everyone goes to Indian restaurants,' says Bilimoria.

In December 1999, it launched a high-profile lawsuit against a file-sharing service which - however much it may have been a thorn in the RIAA's side - had hitherto been a relatively marginal player on the internet.The main effect of the legal action was to alert millions of kids worldwide to the fact that it was possible (a) to store music files on one's hard disk and (b) to swap same over the net. These discoveries brought hordes of new users to Napster who might otherwise have never heard of the service. When the lawsuit began, the service had less than a million users a month. Since then it has climbed steadily to around 9 million a month and a total subscriber base of around 50 million people. </p> <p>For most teenagers, Napster was a concept only marginally inferior to sex. Of course the fact that it enabled them to build up collections of free music on their (or their parents') hard disks was a large part of the attraction . But what was also significant was that Napster enabled them to undermine the recording industry's practice of selling music only in album-sized bundles - which forces music fans to shell out for an entire disk even if all they really want is a couple of tracks (for which most of them would be willing to pay). These twin attractions were what made Napster the fastest-growing network in history - from zero to 50 million subscribers in less than two years - a faster growth rate than the web itself. </p> <p>The RIAA moguls rejoicing that they have finally put a stop to this nonsense seem to have overlooked a few vital points. The first is that the majority of Napster users are (a) music lovers and (b) young. That is to say, they are the prime customers of the aforementioned moguls and their best hope of cashing in their stock options before retirement. </p> <p>Second, there are now 50 million of these prime customers with music tracks on their hard disks who have acquired the habit of swapping them over the net. </p> <p>The publicity surrounding the court case has alerted them to the fact that they need not abandon this agreeable practice - they can turn to systems like OpenNap, iMESH or Aimster which do similar things. 'The entire Napster-using public is going to figure out that they don't need Napster to share files,' wrote Eben Moglen, a Columbia University law professor, in Salon. 'The music industry will then discover that the lawsuit was the stupidest part of five years of stupidity. It will discover that this lawsuit fully popularised, publicised, promoted and spurred the development of the very alternative distribution system it was trying to eliminate.' </p> <p>The RIAA may have succeeded in closing down Napster the company. What then? Are RIAA lawyers going to knock on 50 million doors? 'They've attempted to murder Napster, and they've actually shot themselves in the head,' says Professor Moglen. 'Self-murder or suicide, they're dead either way - it's an untenable business strategy in the long run to be at war with your own customers. But shutting down Napster will give them no one to sue but the listeners. This is one of those rare, but important, situations in which victory in a lawsuit is defeat in the world.'

      "trailText": "<p>Should Western banks do business with a Russian aluminium giant accused of murder, extortion, fraud and money laundering? Why ever not, ask the institutions.  Simon Pirani reports</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A mighty aluminium producer, the second-largest in the world, has risen from the wilds of Siberia - and the big European banks don't know what to do with it. </p> <p>Russian Aluminium has an annual turnover of more than $5 billion, produces one in every 10 tonnes of the world's primary aluminium, and the commodities finance specialists say they can't afford not to lend to it. But credit committees caution that its general director and others face a $2.7 million damages civil action in a New York court alleging 'numerous criminal acts, including murder, extortion, mail and wire fraud and money laundering'. </p> <p>The New York case was lodged in December by trading companies that claim they lost business when a group headed by Russian Aluminium's general director, Oleg Deripaska, took control of Novokuznetsk aluminium smelter in western Siberia. </p> <p>The group's bankers weren't the only ones to get nervous: the organisers of the World Economic Forum at Davos in January cancelled Deripaska's invitation. </p> <p>But Deripaska insists the law suit is 'baseless', and that double standards were at work at Davos. He asked why he should be ostracised when other figures facing legal action - billionaire financier George Soros is due to stand trial in France for insider dealing - were welcomed. </p> <p>On 22 January Deripaska flew to London to dispel fears among bankers who have lent, or are intending to lend, to Russian Aluminium. Their response was positive. A source at one bank said: 'Publicity such as that generated in New York never helps, but the company's economic fundamentals are sound, and that's what really mattered.' </p> <p>Banks visited by Deripaska included those in France (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP Paribas, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais), Germany (West LB, Hypo Vereinsbank), the Netherlands, (ING Barings), Belgium (Fortis, KBC), Austria (Raiffeisen Bank) and the UK (Standard Bank London). </p> <p>WestLB has already syndicated a $100m loan to Russian Aluminium and is negotiating a further $50m. Loans from two other banks are close to approval. These are short-term deals, collateralised on proceeds from aluminium exports. </p> <p>Russian Aluminium, formed last April from a merger of assets controlled by oil magnate Roman Abramovich with Deripaska's Siberian Aluminium, now needs not so much ready cash as a credit history to allow it to tap the capital markets for future investment projects. </p> <p>Aleksandr Bulygin, deputy general director of Russian Aluminium, told The Observer: 'We will follow the issues raised in the New York case right through, and get to the bottom of it. We discussed this at last month's meeting with the banks and had clear indications, from their top managements, that our relationship will continue unchanged.' </p> <p>Bulygin said Russian Aluminium hoped to increase its loan commitments from Western banks to $450m from the $250m it has now, and to replace shorter loans with longer-term money for investment. It has also borrowed $250m from Russian banks. </p> <p>Bankers who favour doing business with Russian Aluminium say the lurid New York allegations are simply testimony to methods widespread in Russian industry, where accusations of criminal conspiracies, whether baseless or not, are as common as the conspiracies themselves. </p> <p>The complainants - three trading companies based in Switzerland, the Channel Islands and Cyprus respectively - allege that when Siberian Aluminium took control of the Novokuznetsk smelter last year, it did so by means of a criminal conspiracy, and then cancelled the complainants' contracts to divert business to insiders. </p> <p>The companies did not identify their owners, claiming they feared reprisals, but Russian Aluminium says they are linked to Mikhail Zhivilo, head of Mikom, which managed Novokuznetsk until the takeover. </p> <p>Zhivilo is subject to an international arrest warrant after being charged with the attempted murder of Aman Tuleyev, the governor of Kemerovo, where the smelter is based. Zhivilo and the New York complainants say that the charges against Zhivilo are politically motivated. </p> <p>Svetlana Smirnova, metals analyst at Renaissance Capital investment group in Moscow, said the New York suit was just another weapon in the battle for control: 'Mikom and its partners were angry. They couldn't get Tuleyev's support and they lost the battle for Novokuznetsk. The $2bn damages figure is ridiculous: the smelter's annual turnover is no more than $450m.' </p> <p>On the long view, the consolidation of the aluminium industry - Russian Aluminium and a rival, SUAL, now control more than 90 per cent - will help end a dark age in which criminal gangs fought for control of the giant Russian smelters and export proceeds often poured into the coffers of shady offshore trading companies. </p> <p>After the USSR collapsed, the industry was divided by means of 'aluminium wars' in which smelter managers, metals traders, journalists and others who fell foul of the gangs were slaughtered. The fiercest battle was for control of the world's biggest aluminium smelter, Krasnoyarsk in Siberia. </p> <p>During this period Anatoly Bykov rose from being head of security at the smelter to chairman of its board in 1997. By last year his star had fallen and he fled the country. He was arrested in Hungary in April and extradited to Russia on murder, gun-running and money-laundering charges. After being released pending trial in August, Bykov - who still owns a 28 per cent stake in the Krasnoyarsk smelter - was bizarrely rearrested in Moscow and charged with murdering, and then conspiring to murder, a businessman who turned out to be alive, his death having been elaborately faked by the prosecutor's office. Bykov denies wrong doing and says the forthcoming trial is politically inspired. </p> <p>During Bykov's heyday, much aluminium from Krasnoyarsk and the Bratsk smelter was traded by Trans World Group, a London trading company owned by multimillionaires Simon and David Reuben. The group owned a web of more than 100 trading companies and banks. Until last year it also had a controlling stake at Bratsk and smaller holdings in the other large Russian smelters. </p> <p>At its height, in 1997, Trans World Group had sales of $6bn and produced half of Russia's aluminium and a fifth of its steel. It was heavily criticised by Russian authorities, who said the system was a leech on the nation's economy. </p> <p>Trans World's ability to perform so well during this period raised eyebrows. Inquiries by Russian prosecutors and parliamentary sub-committees were inconclusive and no action was taken. In 1997 the company was investigated by the Russian police and the UK National Criminal Intelligence Service, but no charges were brought. </p> <p>In the end, Trans World was pushed out of the aluminium industry not by any suggestion of wrongdoing, but by bigger, stronger business interests. Last year its holdings in Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk and an alumina refinery, Achinsk, were sold to companies controlled by Roman Abramovich, governor of the distant province of Chukotka, key shareholder in the Sibneft oil company and one of Russia's biggest oligarchs (politically influential businessmen). </p> <p>Then, in the biggest merger in the history of post-Soviet business, these assets were put together in May last year with Deripaska's Siberian Aluminium to form Russian Aluminium. Permission from Russia's anti-monopoly ministry is still pending, but Bulygin does not doubt it will come through. 'We have had favourable indications from the ministry,' he says. </p> <p>The liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta went so far as to claim, in an article entitled 'A country for two', that Abramovich and Aleksandr Mamut, who heads MDM Bank - now one of Russia's strongest, and a key lender to Russian Aluminium - could soon control '50 per cent of Russian industry'. </p> <p>The primitive 'gangster capitalism' that developed in the wake of the USSR's collapse is giving way to new monopolists.

      "bodyText": "A mighty aluminium producer, the second-largest in the world, has risen from the wilds of Siberia - and the big European banks don't know what to do with it. Russian Aluminium has an annual turnover of more than $5 billion, produces one in every 10 tonnes of the world's primary aluminium, and the commodities finance specialists say they can't afford not to lend to it. But credit committees caution that its general director and others face a $2.7 million damages civil action in a New York court alleging 'numerous criminal acts, including murder, extortion, mail and wire fraud and money laundering'. The New York case was lodged in December by trading companies that claim they lost business when a group headed by Russian Aluminium's general director, Oleg Deripaska, took control of Novokuznetsk aluminium smelter in western Siberia. The group's bankers weren't the only ones to get nervous: the organisers of the World Economic Forum at Davos in January cancelled Deripaska's invitation. But Deripaska insists the law suit is 'baseless', and that double standards were at work at Davos. He asked why he should be ostracised when other figures facing legal action - billionaire financier George Soros is due to stand trial in France for insider dealing - were welcomed. On 22 January Deripaska flew to London to dispel fears among bankers who have lent, or are intending to lend, to Russian Aluminium. Their response was positive. A source at one bank said: 'Publicity such as that generated in New York never helps, but the company's economic fundamentals are sound, and that's what really mattered.' Banks visited by Deripaska included those in France (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP Paribas, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais), Germany (West LB, Hypo Vereinsbank), the Netherlands, (ING Barings), Belgium (Fortis, KBC), Austria (Raiffeisen Bank) and the UK (Standard Bank London). WestLB has already syndicated a $100m loan to Russian Aluminium and is negotiating a further $50m. Loans from two other banks are close to approval. These are short-term deals, collateralised on proceeds from aluminium exports. Russian Aluminium, formed last April from a merger of assets controlled by oil magnate Roman Abramovich with Deripaska's Siberian Aluminium, now needs not so much ready cash as a credit history to allow it to tap the capital markets for future investment projects. Aleksandr Bulygin, deputy general director of Russian Aluminium, told The Observer: 'We will follow the issues raised in the New York case right through, and get to the bottom of it. We discussed this at last month's meeting with the banks and had clear indications, from their top managements, that our relationship will continue unchanged.' Bulygin said Russian Aluminium hoped to increase its loan commitments from Western banks to $450m from the $250m it has now, and to replace shorter loans with longer-term money for investment. It has also borrowed $250m from Russian banks. Bankers who favour doing business with Russian Aluminium say the lurid New York allegations are simply testimony to methods widespread in Russian industry, where accusations of criminal conspiracies, whether baseless or not, are as common as the conspiracies themselves. The complainants - three trading companies based in Switzerland, the Channel Islands and Cyprus respectively - allege that when Siberian Aluminium took control of the Novokuznetsk smelter last year, it did so by means of a criminal conspiracy, and then cancelled the complainants' contracts to divert business to insiders. The companies did not identify their owners, claiming they feared reprisals, but Russian Aluminium says they are linked to Mikhail Zhivilo, head of Mikom, which managed Novokuznetsk until the takeover. Zhivilo is subject to an international arrest warrant after being charged with the attempted murder of Aman Tuleyev, the governor of Kemerovo, where the smelter is based. Zhivilo and the New York complainants say that the charges against Zhivilo are politically motivated. Svetlana Smirnova, metals analyst at Renaissance Capital investment group in Moscow, said the New York suit was just another weapon in the battle for control: 'Mikom and its partners were angry. They couldn't get Tuleyev's support and they lost the battle for Novokuznetsk. The $2bn damages figure is ridiculous: the smelter's annual turnover is no more than $450m.' On the long view, the consolidation of the aluminium industry - Russian Aluminium and a rival, SUAL, now control more than 90 per cent - will help end a dark age in which criminal gangs fought for control of the giant Russian smelters and export proceeds often poured into the coffers of shady offshore trading companies. After the USSR collapsed, the industry was divided by means of 'aluminium wars' in which smelter managers, metals traders, journalists and others who fell foul of the gangs were slaughtered. The fiercest battle was for control of the world's biggest aluminium smelter, Krasnoyarsk in Siberia. During this period Anatoly Bykov rose from being head of security at the smelter to chairman of its board in 1997. By last year his star had fallen and he fled the country. He was arrested in Hungary in April and extradited to Russia on murder, gun-running and money-laundering charges. After being released pending trial in August, Bykov - who still owns a 28 per cent stake in the Krasnoyarsk smelter - was bizarrely rearrested in Moscow and charged with murdering, and then conspiring to murder, a businessman who turned out to be alive, his death having been elaborately faked by the prosecutor's office. Bykov denies wrong doing and says the forthcoming trial is politically inspired. During Bykov's heyday, much aluminium from Krasnoyarsk and the Bratsk smelter was traded by Trans World Group, a London trading company owned by multimillionaires Simon and David Reuben. The group owned a web of more than 100 trading companies and banks. Until last year it also had a controlling stake at Bratsk and smaller holdings in the other large Russian smelters. At its height, in 1997, Trans World Group had sales of $6bn and produced half of Russia's aluminium and a fifth of its steel. It was heavily criticised by Russian authorities, who said the system was a leech on the nation's economy. Trans World's ability to perform so well during this period raised eyebrows. Inquiries by Russian prosecutors and parliamentary sub-committees were inconclusive and no action was taken. In 1997 the company was investigated by the Russian police and the UK National Criminal Intelligence Service, but no charges were brought. In the end, Trans World was pushed out of the aluminium industry not by any suggestion of wrongdoing, but by bigger, stronger business interests. Last year its holdings in Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk and an alumina refinery, Achinsk, were sold to companies controlled by Roman Abramovich, governor of the distant province of Chukotka, key shareholder in the Sibneft oil company and one of Russia's biggest oligarchs (politically influential businessmen). Then, in the biggest merger in the history of post-Soviet business, these assets were put together in May last year with Deripaska's Siberian Aluminium to form Russian Aluminium. Permission from Russia's anti-monopoly ministry is still pending, but Bulygin does not doubt it will come through. 'We have had favourable indications from the ministry,' he says. The liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta went so far as to claim, in an article entitled 'A country for two', that Abramovich and Aleksandr Mamut, who heads MDM Bank - now one of Russia's strongest, and a key lender to Russian Aluminium - could soon control '50 per cent of Russian industry'. The primitive 'gangster capitalism' that developed in the wake of the USSR's collapse is giving way to new monopolists. It's a natural process, say western enthusiasts for Russian Aluminium, who believe those who want to spurn the company because of its strife-torn origins are hypocrites. After all, they argue, the history of the French Fifth Republic is being rewritten in the Elf-Aquitaine case to show how oil oligarchs funded Gaullism. Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl had similar problems with funding. And in the US, prosecutors are fuming at Bill Clinton's pardon for the oil trading oligarch Marc Rich, who was wanted for tax evasion. One Moscow-based banker said: 'To those who say that for westerners to work with a company as dynamic and exciting as Russian Aluminium is morally questionable, I would say: physician, heal thyself.'",

Robusta beans, used for blended and instant coffees, have fared much the same and now stand at around 30 cents. </p> <p>Last October members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) agreed to retain a fifth of exports in order to raise prices, which they claim are too low to provide an economic return. Vietnam, the world's second-largest producer, last week backed the plan and will hold back 2.5 million 60kg bags - the standard measure for coffee and amounting to 150,000 tonnes - from the market. </p> <p>In real terms, world coffee prices are less than a quarter of 1970 levels. The emergence of Vietnam as a major producer, accounting for a tenth of global output, is a chief factor behind a rise in world production and a slump in prices. The fall has been catastrophic for countries such as Ethiopia and Uganda, which rely on coffee for most of their foreign exchange earnings. </p> <p>After an ACPC meeting in London in January, the association's secretary-general, Roberio Silva, predicted that the retention plan would raise prices 'within a month'. Brazil, the largest producer, accounting for more than a quarter of world output, has so far retained 2.2 million 60kg bags, more than 10 per cent of its exports last year, Colombia 600,000 bags and Mexico 90,000 bags. 'I'm confident that as stocks decrease in consuming countries, so we shall see a recovery in world prices,' said Silva. </p> <p>Yet, despite the mushrooming of coffee bars in the high streets of western countries, supply still exceeds demand. The International Coffee Organisation estimates that production in 2000-2001 will be 113 million bags, of which nearly 11 million will remain unsold. A total of 88.5 million bags were exported in 2000, and the retention by the producers of 20 per cent of that - 18 million bags - means demand would run ahead of supply, swinging the price back in the producers' favour. </p> <p>This happened in the mid-Seventies, when frost in Brazil and disruptions to supplies from other countries reduced world output by a quarter. The price of coffee more than tripled as a result. A cutback of 20 per cent could now be expected to at least double the world price. </p> <p>But the retention plan requires discipline on the part of producers. Holding back exports leaves unsold coffee in producing countries, which growers may be tempted to dispose of in 'back door' deals at low prices rather than see it rot. Burning the surpluses is one option. The other is for producers to agree to cut acreages under coffee. But production quotas would be even more difficult to enforce than export quotas. </p> <p>The existing low prices are, however, likely to mean 'natural' cutbacks in output. Mexico, which last year harvested 6.3 million bags, is this year expected to produce only 3.5 million as growers find it uneconomic to tend the crop. </p> <p>The tragedy for most of the 10 million people who grow coffee is that, although higher world prices will benefit the ACPC, on the ground they could make little difference. Most coffee is traded down a line of dealers before export and can change hands as many as 150 times.The growers' returns will remain meagre. A sustained period of low prices in the early Nineties left many growers destitute; some lost their land while others neglected their crop. </p> <p>But around half a million coffee growers are now receiving more than three times the world price in an alternative market. They are those who grouped together in farmers' organisations to sell directly to coffee roasting companies who have been awarded the 'Fairtrade Mark'. These companies must pay a price that gives growers a guaranteed return, including a premium for social investment. Sales of 'Fairtrade' coffee in the UK are booming - they rose by an average 47 per cent a year between 1994 and 1999. </p> <p>Fairtrade roasters such as Edinburgh-based Caf\u00e9 Direct, which buys from 17 farmers' organisations in nine countries, pay arabica growers 126 cents a pound and robusta growers 106 cents, whatever the world price. </p> <p>But outside of this system, for consumers as for growers, changes in world price make little difference. Although it has halved in the past year, there has been little change in shop prices. 'The price of the beans is very small part of the cost of a jar of coffee,' said a Nestl\u00e9 spokesman. </p> <p>That so much is spent on packaging, marketing and distribution can be of little comfort to those at either end of the chain. </p> <p><strong>The daily grind</strong></p> <p> Grown in around 80 warm countries, coffee is normally the world's most valuable traded primary commodity after oil, but the market has long been volatile. </p> <p>Arabica coffee grows in relatively high altitudes - over 600 metres - in countries such as Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia, where it originated.

The average 29- to 34-year-old teacher earns \u00a322,350. Enough, at three and a half times earnings, to afford a mortgage on a three-bedroom house in, say, Lincolnshire. The same teacher in London, with the maximum allowance for working in the inner-city, is on about \u00a327,000. So the largest mortgage she or he could safely take out would be about \u00a394,000. But the average equivalent house in a not-so-smart London borough such as Lewisham costs \u00a3203,000. Even in the outer reaches of the capital - Bexley, say - you are looking at \u00a3137,000. How do you bridge the gap which, it is widely held in the profession, would restore demand and supply to balance? The immediate answer would appear to be to increase London weighting. But by how much? Let's assume our average South London teacher - and south is cheaper than west or north - has to live in the cheapest district. Even then his or her salary would have to be increased by \u00a312,000 to afford that average house - a rise of 44 per cent. Apoplexy ensues. An outrageous burden on taxpayers - after all, teachers get 13 weeks' holiday. Can't they flip burgers in their spare time? But this is the 'market rate' so beloved of chief executives when their remuneration committees up their own 'package' by a similar percentage. And surely the production of a well-taught, highly skilled workforce is in the long-term interests of business and the country as a whole? Of course, it's a pipe dream. But without it, or some other inspired initiative, we face a nightmare.",

Nothing happened between the January and February meetings to alleviate their fears about the pace of consumption or the potential inflationary effects of a tight labour market. Indeed, last week's statistics on unemployment and wage earnings indicate that, if anything, the position from their point of view is more threatening than it appeared in January. </p> <p>But these members of what is sometimes known as the Bank's politburo also tied themselves in further at the January meeting.

It should not be too difficult to improve on that, you might have thought. </p> <p>Earlier in the week a news bulletin had also informed us: 'Inflation is at its lowest since records began 25 years ago.' Oh yes? There seems to have been some heavy Government briefing on the inflation figures last week; but even for a Labour Party that thinks history began on 1 May 1997, the idea that inflation records go back only to 1976 is a little far-fetched. </p> <p>As a matter of fact, this country's inflation records go back to within 200 years of the arrival of William the Conqueror. Anybody who is interested can find them in tables produced by the late Douglas Jay in his book Sterling (1985). They show that, even without the benefit of Gordon Brown's invention of the Monetary Policy Committee, prices in 1464 were barely above their level in 1264, when records began. </p> <p>What the 25-year claims seem to refer to is the relatively new index for measuring inflation, known by the ungainly initials RPIX, standing for Retail Prices Index Excluding mortgage interest payments. It is this index that is at the core of this Government's macro-economic policy, a policy which places great weight on the achievement of an annual rate of inflation of 2.5 per cent. </p> <p>The reason for the exclusion of mortgage rates from the index is to avoid a situation where, in its attempts to curb inflation, the Bank's actions make things worse. When it raises interest rates, it attempts to slow the economy down by restricting credit or making the pound less competitive (higher interest rates attract money to London, pushing the pound up). Mortgage rates automatically rise when base rates rise, pushing the cost of living up in the short term, before the other consequences of higher interest rates take effect. The RPIX index removes this distortion. </p> <p>Last week's much-publicised achievement was the news that the RPIX index had risen by only 1.8 per cent between January 2000 and January 2001. By contrast, because of earlier interest rates rises, the broader RPI had risen by 2.7 per cent. </p> <p>In a way inflation is back to the 'golden days' of the Fifties - days which did not seem quite so golden at the time. Between 1952 and 1960 prices rose by 3.25 per cent a year (compound). There were years when inflation was as low as 0.6 per cent (1959) and 1 per cent (1960). </p> <p>A huge volume of economic literature has been devoted to what went wrong on the inflation front in the Seventies. The trouble started in 1969, when, partly as a consequence of the devaluation of the pound in 1967, inflation rose to 5.4 per cent. Harold Wilson, Prime Minister at the time, had famously claimed: 'The pound in your pocket has not been devalued.' Oh yes it had - to the extent that import prices were higher. </p> <p>The war in Vietnam was also proving inflationary for the key world economy, the US. Oil producers, whose prices were quoted in dollars, did not like the way the money in their pockets was devalued when the dollar itself was devalued in the early Seventies. That led to the oil price explosion. Meanwhile, trade unions became more active in their wage claims, and a vicious price-wage-price spiral developed. Against this background, the decimalisation of our currency (another of last week's historical celebrations) 30 years ago in 1971 was a relatively minor factor. </p> <p>The policies of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and, until recently, Peter Mandelson are essentially a reaction to the troubles Labour had with inflation in the Seventies. In August 1975 year-on-year inflation reached 26.9 per cent. I recall Sir Kenneth Berrill, then head of the Government's think-tank (they had one in those days) saying that at that rate the miners would soon be earning a million pounds a year. </p> <p>A modicum of inflation had generally been considered a good thing, fostering economic growth, after the deflation and slumps of the interwar years. But the mid-Seventies experience was frightening: everybody knew what hyper-inflation had done to other societies. The government of James Callaghan (1976-1979) had a very difficult time, and, with some people at the White House fearing Britain was going to fall to a left-wing coup, we were rescued from financial crisis by an International Monetary Fund loan. (The charming British IMF official who conducted the negotiations, Sir Alan Whittome, died last month.) </p> <p>Now that rampant inflation has been conquered (at least for the foreseeable future) we are back to a world where a modicum of inflation is considered useful to oil the wheels of capitalism. Discussion of the economy in the US takes place almost entirely in terms of managing demand in the economy, with the inflation outcome almost incidental. Here the 'symmetrical' inflation target imposed on the MPC by the Chancellor means that if inflation shows signs of falling below 1.5 per cent, the MPC must take measures to stimulate the economy. </p> <p>Japan is the outstanding example of an economy where falling prices have a negative impact on growth. The latest fashionable cure being advocated for Japan is that it should have an inflation target, to boost credit and get the economy moving again. Meanwhile the European Central Bank, with no obligation to boost demand, is being criticised for failing to lead the way in response to deteriorating business surveys in Germany and cut interest rates. </p> <p>But perhaps the best news last week was that Britain had edged even nearer to full employment, an issue about which I know the Chancellor feels passionately. The fact is that, when inflation is not a problem, governments and central banks have it in their power to create conditions for as much employment as people want. </p> <p>But it must be said that, even now, unemployment in this country is not the lowest since records began...</p>",

The Stoli deal was seen as a key consolation prize for Allied, which lost out in December to Diageo and France's Pernod Ricard in the battle for Canada's Seagram.

'We'd turned into friends again and although we still loved each other as mates, it was time to move on.' There had been talk of a double wedding with Norman Cook and Zo\u00eb Ball, and when I ask if living out a relationship so publicly added to the pressure, Thornhill just laughs.</p> <p>'Sara was very public, not me,' he says, pointing out that most of the time, the paparazzi who photographed them outside parties had to ask him who he was. Which is how he likes it. 'It's Sara's little world, TV people, Chris Evans and all that stuff. It's about being a big, famous star in England. Everyone has to know your business. I may be English, but it's a very small world to me. The next country is just two minutes away. I've got a slightly bigger view on life than a little island.'</p> <p>Travelling with the Prodigy, he's seen more than he ever dreamed possible, from war-torn Bosnia and the poverty in post-apartheid South Africa to playing in Moscow's Red Square and at the Knebworth gigs that were the peak of Oasis's career.

      "body": "<p>Railtrack is appealing directly to the Government for a \u00a32 billion bail-out to prevent a financial crisis after it was turned down by Sir Alastair Morton and the Strategic Rail Authority. </p> <p>The desperate move effectively means that the company expects the taxpayer to cover the cost of the Hatfield crash - it originally said its shareholders would pay for it - and even to support basic maintenance of the lines and signalling network. </p> <p>Railtrack chief executive Steve Marshall said the extra money was to keep debt under control. He denied it amounted to using public funds to cover the cost of Hatfield, which City and train operator sources have put at up to \u00a3900m, compared with Marshall's estimate of \u00a3580m. </p> <p>He said the company was 'absolutely committed' to projects such as the TPWS safety system, the \u00a35.8 billion West Coast mainline modernisation and the Thameslink 2000 scheme to rebuild London's King's Cross interchange. It would borrow to fund them if there was no extra subsidy. </p> <p>Such a move would put the company's debt and interest payments at crisis levels, however, and is the equivalent of a threat to the Government that such vital projects are reliant on a bail-out. </p> <p>And Marshall admitted that the company was not able to commit itself to any other projects and could not even afford to upgrade the East Coast mainline without extra funding.

      "bodyText": "Railtrack is appealing directly to the Government for a \u00a32 billion bail-out to prevent a financial crisis after it was turned down by Sir Alastair Morton and the Strategic Rail Authority. The desperate move effectively means that the company expects the taxpayer to cover the cost of the Hatfield crash - it originally said its shareholders would pay for it - and even to support basic maintenance of the lines and signalling network. Railtrack chief executive Steve Marshall said the extra money was to keep debt under control. He denied it amounted to using public funds to cover the cost of Hatfield, which City and train operator sources have put at up to \u00a3900m, compared with Marshall's estimate of \u00a3580m. He said the company was 'absolutely committed' to projects such as the TPWS safety system, the \u00a35.8 billion West Coast mainline modernisation and the Thameslink 2000 scheme to rebuild London's King's Cross interchange. It would borrow to fund them if there was no extra subsidy. Such a move would put the company's debt and interest payments at crisis levels, however, and is the equivalent of a threat to the Government that such vital projects are reliant on a bail-out. And Marshall admitted that the company was not able to commit itself to any other projects and could not even afford to upgrade the East Coast mainline without extra funding. 'Apart from the work under way at Leeds station,' he said, 'the rest of East Coast is not a committed scheme. It is in the balance.' The admission will infuriate the Government and makes last week's row about the East Coast - provoked when Railtrack's initial estimate of \u00a31.9bn for the work soared to between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a33.8bn - seem almost academic. Nigel Davies, transport analyst at stockbroker WestLB Panmure, said the City believed Railtrack's share price, which closed down 60p on the week at 949p, was surviving at its current level only on the assumption that the Treasury was going to inject rescue cash. There is pressure on Railtrack to appoint a new, Government-approved executive chairman to take control of the company from Marshall. If the company cannot achieve a bail-out by the end of March, it will turn to rail regulator Tom Winsor for an emergency financial review. Marshall insisted this weekend that his finance team was 'still working with the SRA', but admitted he was talking to the Government. The train operator source said: 'Railtrack have had discussions with Treasury about extra money, but it cannot be counted as part of the SRA budget. They have had a chat with Morton but the door remains closed.' The SRA had been due to feed \u00a34.5bn of government grants to Railtrack over the next five years. But now the company wants it all to be handed over in the next three years to ensure it can perform basic maintenance and complete projects without being crippled by debt and losing its 'single A' credit rating. The source said: 'At the moment neither the Treasury nor Morton is prepared to give handouts to the Railtrack management.'

Instead of the usual steely opulence, Geraldine McGreevey's Countess wore an air of passive expectation; if this reduced her as a character, it gave her perversely even more credibility as the spurned wife. The baritone, Gidon Saks, a towering figure with a sumptuous dark voice, had potent stage presence as the Count. Next week Birmingham, then on tour. Schubert, despite efforts at the real thing, found his true operatic skills in writing songs, each one a drama in miniature depicting a world, a mood, a situation. His 1823 song-cycle Die Sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin (The Fair Maid of the Mill), at first glance, appears a charming pastoral collection about nature and love. Hidden within is an agonising saga of rejection and suicide, expressed in some of the most bleakly melancholy music ever written. The young German tenor, Marcus Ullman, preceded by a louder than usual fanfare of pre-publicity, was ensured a full house for his London debut. An attentive Wigmore Hall audience called him (and his pianist Alexander Schmalcz) back four times for applause. Deft though his handling was, with an effective change of timbre for the urgent, angry songs mid-cycle, Ullman has far to go before achieving the intensity and variety of a really great Lieder singer - Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the past, Ian Bostridge now. The advance praise may have been a little premature. He struggled audibly for the high notes, straining rather than floating and often at the expense of intonation. Schubert's songs have infinite meaning. The circumstances of their composition (he was being treated for syphilis at the time) add to their poignancy. If the singing sounds effortful, this other worldiness is lost. Bostridge performs the same cycle next month. It's sold out of course, but you could always hang around outside with a plaintive look, or a cosh.",

The charmingly corrected omission is the only thing so far to give tonight's crowd cause to feel short-changed. </p> <p>She had signalled her intent right from the start, strolling on to stage and launching into 'Rid of Me', her uncompromising song about being dumped. It was a sensational start. She stood rigid, square-shouldered, strumming energetically and belting out the lyrics without restraint. She ended the song with the a cappella proclamation: 'Lick my legs, I'm on fire' to the whoops of the crowd. This was Polly of old: defiant, punky and passionate. When she sings like this her angst and rage are indistinguishable. It's an opening that leaves you breathless with its emotional immediacy: the rest of the show has a lot to live up to. </p> <p>With the release last year of her swaggering, catchy New York-influenced album Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, a new, lighter Polly emerged. The familiar themes of lost love, degradation, anguish, were largely absent, prompting speculation that the singer had set sail on a new course. Well, up to a point. Tonight's confident performance is an exercise in the potency of an artist enjoying a purple patch. Although her last album was her most commercial to date, it was also a risk for the Mercury Music Prize shortlist perennial with a loyal and discerning fanbase. </p> <p>Old-school Polly fans I spoke to before the gig liked the last record but admitted they 'preferred the old stuff'. It wasn't quite the same as Dylan plugging his guitar into an amp and embracing heresy but Harvey had got something to prove.

Her unique voice, sometimes stentorian, sometimes coquettish, rises above the competing guitars, reaching parts other singers can't. At times there are three loud guitarists, including Harvey, firing off low riffs and jangling chords in glorious tandem, but Polly's larynx rules.

The crowd respond with head-nodding appreciation for all but a couple of the more up-tempo songs. For all the energy on stage, however, there is something that doesn't quite transfer to the audience; perhaps it's just a bit too calculated. The show has certainly been well staged. The band are mostly clad in black, while Harvey favours a clinging scarlet dress with matching heels. The contradiction between her slick guise and her music is intentional and effective. It's an outfit that draws intermittent lascivious comments from male punters which Harvey chooses to ignore. Her sex appeal is obvious: uncompromising, fervent, unpredictable and slightly aloof. She is the poster girl for the thinking music fan. You can say 'Phwoar' at Polly and no one will mistake you for a refugee from a Jennifer Lopez concert. Her new image is certainly more sophisticated than the shocking pink catsuit she wore onstage a few years back. </p> <p>The sanguine songs from her latest album dominate the set. After 'Rid of Me', she goes into the compelling and melodic 'This Is Love' and follows it with the jaunty 'Good Fortune', which fuses a Patti Smith lick with Chrissie Hynde's attitude. The lyrics sparkle with optimism: 'And I feel like some bird of paradise/ My bad fortune slipping away/ And I feel the innocence of a child/ Everybody's got something good to say.' Even though this isn't a new song, it's strange to watch her sing these lyrics while tottering around the stage with an enthusiasm Tina Turner would admire. </p> <p>Favourite songs from Stories are lifted when performed live. 'Kamikaze' builds to a marvellous, noisy crescendo before it ends abruptly and the audience lets out a collective breath. The album's opener, 'Big Exit', is an incendiary showstopper: 'I wanna pistol/ I wanna gun/ I'm scared baby/ I wanna run,' yells Harvey. </p> <p>Polly purists would have been heartened by 'Man Size' and 'Send His Love To Me', which boasts spiralling Celtic-style guitars to match Harvey's romantic pleading. The crowd greet the sombre 'Angelene' like an old favourite and are rewarded with a beautiful rendition. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Thom Yorke does not make an appearance for the encore, 'The Mess We're In', the haunting track on which he guested last year.

Unlike Sylvie Guillem, Rojo does not impose her interpretation on the choreography; she lets it speak through her, so that she is both MacMillan's creature and her own. </p> <p>She starts out headstrong, an overwrought girl whose slender, craning neck reveals her passionate curiosity about Romeo, the interloper at her coming-out ball. We see him through her eyes, a young man dancing his heart out. Without her in the second act, he is a cypher, lost in the crowd. She drives the story, taking the burden of Verona's tribal hatreds on her fledgling shoulders. Rojo's Juliet is one of MacMillan's deeply damaged heroines, who conveys her pain visibly as though she had been flayed. </p> <p>The ballet's narrowing focus in the last act accentuates her loneliness. She becomes a pale flame in the darkness surrounding her, fighting extinction. Her fury at discovering Romeo's still-warm body is a flare-up of rage at the universe. The searing final image is rightly hers, body arched heart-upwards over the tomb slab, Romeo lost in the gloom. </p> <p>Ashton's sunny <strong> La Fille mal gard\u00e9e</strong> is running in tandem with MacMillan's tragedy, an antidote to Juliet's bitter potion. Ethan Stiefel has arrived from the United States to partner Sarah Wildor (their last performance this Wednesday) as well as being seen on screen in Nicholas Hytner's film, Centre Stage. </p> <p>Stiefel is a bright spark, as cheery as his yellow breeches. His midwestern Colas strides into the French farmyard, twirling a ribbon instead of a lariat. He knows all about impersonating a high-stepping pony to entertain his girlfriend, Lise. But their attempt at making a cat's cradle with the ribbon was a trick too far at his matin\u00e9e debut. Wildor's Lise is sweetly, soppily in love with him, though she can be as mischievous as he. Stiefel dances with the extra clarity an American training provides, pinging off the stage as though bouncing on a trampoline. He and Wildor, well matched, are so frank in their feelings that Ashton's open positions for the rural lovers, arms and legs flung wide, read like XXXs for Valentine's Day kisses. </p> <p><strong> Mark Baldwin</strong> has taken on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth for his new work, The Bird Sings With its Fingers . It is to a commissioned score by Julian Anderson, played on Radio 3 as the ballet premiered on tour. Baldwin's triple bill is a collaboration with the 35-piece Sinfonia 21 orchestra, aiming to bring modern dance and music audiences together for a concert on equal terms. </p> <p>The music dominates, though, for a mere seven dancers cannot meet the demands of the big, intricate scores Baldwin has chosen. Anderson's music is so concentrated that the 15-minute piece seems to be imploding, sucking its material into the black hole of the underworld. </p> <p>Baldwin counters by dressing his cast in white, placing them in an ashen limbo. Although the characters are not identified, Kate Coyne is Death and Laurent Cavanna Orpheus, defying her over the body of Sarah Worsop's tender Eurydice. Elusive as mercury, echoes of Cocteau's Orpheus films haunt the music and dance. We need time to tease out the references, rehear the score; a second or third encounter should be more enlightening. </p> <p>The rest of the programme, set to Stravinsky's Danses Concertantes and Louis Andriessen's De Staat, is far more stimulating to the ears than the eyes.

      "body": "<p><strong> 88 Wood Street and 100 Wood Street</strong> London EC2 </p> <p> Sudden death by demolition is claiming an entire generation of buildings in the City of London, thrown up in the 1970s when development was a crude hit-and-run business. The air is full of hammering pneumatic drills and swinging cranes. Block upon block has been cleared and fenced off, making the Square Mile look like a mouthful of hollowed-out molars in the midst of a prolonged and painful bout of dentistry. </p> <p>Profoundly unmemorable though the vanished buildings were, they nevertheless leave behind a strange, dislocating sense of loss. We can't remember ever having looked at them, but now that they have gone we know we will never get the chance again. Even more disturbing is the sense that the fragile surface order of urban life has been fractured, allowing the past to ooze up through the cracks, dragging London back to its primordial state when it was still a series of gravel outcrops in the Thames. </p> <p>The City is literally dissolving into a sea of mud, as earth-moving monsters grasp the flimsy aluminium and glass fa\u00e7ades of the Seventies in their claws, leaving brittle fragments of crumbling masonry. </p> <p>Architecture comes and goes all the time, but streets last a little longer. They survive to provide the urban DNA for the City to rebuild itself. Take Wood Street, for example, just emerging from its latest architectural make over. There is no better place to understand the history of postwar British architecture and the way in which one generation has reacted against the next. </p> <p>It was originally created by the Romans as a parade ground for a fort just outside the city wall. In the course of just 50 yards, it boasts a tower designed by Christopher Wren, the last surviving relic of a church that started out as the royal chapel of the Saxon kings. There is a remarkable police station built in the early Sixties by McMorran and Whitby, in dignified classical style. A Terry Farrell art deco-on-steroids high-rise from the Eighties rears over the street at one end, looking as cheerfully embarrassing as Abba's satin flares. Now there is Richard Rogers's office block (No 88), occupied last year, and, immediately next door, Norman Foster has just finished a block of financial trading rooms (No 100). </p> <p>Look at these buildings in Wood Street and you can see with startling clarity exactly how much two architects who began their careers together have diverged. Foster's building looks as if he is trying to challenge the sneaking suspicion that after the genius of such early buildings as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank tower, he is now content to operate the controls of a giant architectural machine that churns out a seemingly endless stream of well-bred but formulaic buildings. The Wood Street building explores new territory for Foster. It has a Portland stone fa\u00e7ade, with a deliberately dumb, chequer-board rhythm of alternating storey-height stone panels and glass windows, that shift back and forth, one bay at a time on each level. It is a mannerism calculated to show that this is a building that does not share the sensibility of its more conventional stone-clad neighbour, which plays by the rules. To underscore the point, Foster has put a vertical black line to cut himself off from that building. He does not touch Rogers, his other neighbour, at all. </p> <p>On the other side of the air gap, Rogers is sticking to what his office does best - romantic modernity. By pulling the structure, stairs and lifts out of the basic envelope, he creates a jagged, picturesque skyline. The piece closest to Foster is wall-to-wall glass, in an elegant concrete frame that is braced by gunmetal grey and stainless steel rods . </p> <p>Round the corner, there is some muscular exposed cross-bracing, beautifully rendered in stainless steel that has the delicacy of jewellery. There is even a touching little cabbage patch of sprouting red and blue funnels to remind us that this is the work of the firm that built the Pompidou Centre. This being a Rogers building, the cascades of steel stairs like streamers inside are painted bright yellow. </p> <p>We talk about buildings as if they were individual works of art, to be understood as discrete aesthetic experiences. But in a dense city like London, they can't exist in isolation. They are inevitably seen as part of a street or in the context of one street interacting with another. </p> <p>We see buildings as the product of chance visual juxtapositions and accidental oblique views, built layer upon layer, that shape the way that buildings are actually experienced much more than the architect's original vision. </p> <p>Last year, Wood Street still backed on to a tight little alley, squashed between a City livery hall and the graveyard of a lost church. But that tight, intimate space has disappeared now, exploded temporarily by the rebuilding of the City. And the junction of Foster's and Rogers's buildings is on centre stage, visible in long views as well as close up. </p> <p>Unlike his stone front to Wood Street, at the back of the building, Foster has scooped out a curved glass skin, hoisted up on a colonnade of raked steel legs. And for all its lack of formal acknowledgment to Rogers's building next door, the clearest image it leaves behind is the reflection of the shiny steel skin next door. It's a mirror just waiting to reflect the next newcomer to take its place in the City, and revealing just how brittle and impermanent even the glossiest of new architecture can be.</p>",

      "bodyText": "88 Wood Street and 100 Wood Street London EC2 Sudden death by demolition is claiming an entire generation of buildings in the City of London, thrown up in the 1970s when development was a crude hit-and-run business. The air is full of hammering pneumatic drills and swinging cranes. Block upon block has been cleared and fenced off, making the Square Mile look like a mouthful of hollowed-out molars in the midst of a prolonged and painful bout of dentistry. Profoundly unmemorable though the vanished buildings were, they nevertheless leave behind a strange, dislocating sense of loss. We can't remember ever having looked at them, but now that they have gone we know we will never get the chance again. Even more disturbing is the sense that the fragile surface order of urban life has been fractured, allowing the past to ooze up through the cracks, dragging London back to its primordial state when it was still a series of gravel outcrops in the Thames. The City is literally dissolving into a sea of mud, as earth-moving monsters grasp the flimsy aluminium and glass fa\u00e7ades of the Seventies in their claws, leaving brittle fragments of crumbling masonry. Architecture comes and goes all the time, but streets last a little longer. They survive to provide the urban DNA for the City to rebuild itself. Take Wood Street, for example, just emerging from its latest architectural make over. There is no better place to understand the history of postwar British architecture and the way in which one generation has reacted against the next. It was originally created by the Romans as a parade ground for a fort just outside the city wall. In the course of just 50 yards, it boasts a tower designed by Christopher Wren, the last surviving relic of a church that started out as the royal chapel of the Saxon kings. There is a remarkable police station built in the early Sixties by McMorran and Whitby, in dignified classical style. A Terry Farrell art deco-on-steroids high-rise from the Eighties rears over the street at one end, looking as cheerfully embarrassing as Abba's satin flares. Now there is Richard Rogers's office block (No 88), occupied last year, and, immediately next door, Norman Foster has just finished a block of financial trading rooms (No 100). Look at these buildings in Wood Street and you can see with startling clarity exactly how much two architects who began their careers together have diverged. Foster's building looks as if he is trying to challenge the sneaking suspicion that after the genius of such early buildings as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank tower, he is now content to operate the controls of a giant architectural machine that churns out a seemingly endless stream of well-bred but formulaic buildings. The Wood Street building explores new territory for Foster. It has a Portland stone fa\u00e7ade, with a deliberately dumb, chequer-board rhythm of alternating storey-height stone panels and glass windows, that shift back and forth, one bay at a time on each level. It is a mannerism calculated to show that this is a building that does not share the sensibility of its more conventional stone-clad neighbour, which plays by the rules. To underscore the point, Foster has put a vertical black line to cut himself off from that building. He does not touch Rogers, his other neighbour, at all. On the other side of the air gap, Rogers is sticking to what his office does best - romantic modernity. By pulling the structure, stairs and lifts out of the basic envelope, he creates a jagged, picturesque skyline. The piece closest to Foster is wall-to-wall glass, in an elegant concrete frame that is braced by gunmetal grey and stainless steel rods . Round the corner, there is some muscular exposed cross-bracing, beautifully rendered in stainless steel that has the delicacy of jewellery. There is even a touching little cabbage patch of sprouting red and blue funnels to remind us that this is the work of the firm that built the Pompidou Centre. This being a Rogers building, the cascades of steel stairs like streamers inside are painted bright yellow. We talk about buildings as if they were individual works of art, to be understood as discrete aesthetic experiences. But in a dense city like London, they can't exist in isolation. They are inevitably seen as part of a street or in the context of one street interacting with another. We see buildings as the product of chance visual juxtapositions and accidental oblique views, built layer upon layer, that shape the way that buildings are actually experienced much more than the architect's original vision. Last year, Wood Street still backed on to a tight little alley, squashed between a City livery hall and the graveyard of a lost church. But that tight, intimate space has disappeared now, exploded temporarily by the rebuilding of the City. And the junction of Foster's and Rogers's buildings is on centre stage, visible in long views as well as close up. Unlike his stone front to Wood Street, at the back of the building, Foster has scooped out a curved glass skin, hoisted up on a colonnade of raked steel legs. And for all its lack of formal acknowledgment to Rogers's building next door, the clearest image it leaves behind is the reflection of the shiny steel skin next door. It's a mirror just waiting to reflect the next newcomer to take its place in the City, and revealing just how brittle and impermanent even the glossiest of new architecture can be.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Murillo: Scenes of Childhood </strong> Dulwich Picture Gallery, London SE21 until 13 May </p> <p> Some shows aim to change your picture of an artist. Others succeed - and <strong> Murillo: Scenes of Childhood</strong> is among them. This is no small feat when you consider that Murillo has been out of fashion for more than a century. Hazlitt thought him 'the triumph... almost of art', but that was in pre-Victorian times, when Murillo got a great press. For the last 100 years or so, he has been routinely spurned as a painter of fondant cherubs, soft-focus saints and unfeasibly cheerful urchins. </p> <p>The reversal was sudden and hard. Born in 1617, Murillo was the leading Sevillian artist of the seventeenth century. He was bigger than Zurbar\u00e1n, more successful than Vel\u00e1zquez, and prized above both on the international market. Eighty years after his death, the Spanish government had to impose an export ban to stop Murillos flooding out of the country. Gainsborough owned and loved his work; Tennyson and Browning swooned before it. Painters from Chardin to Picasso studied his art; scratch more than one Manet and traces of Murillo will emerge. </p> <p>Then, just around the time his paintings were fetching record-breaking prices, Ruskin launched an apoplectic attack in front of some Murillos at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, declaring that they should be torched. He despised the 'vicious slurrings and softness' of his devotional art almost as much as he loathed the urchins' dirt-caked feet. </p> <p>From then on, the hostility ran to free-range contradiction: Murillo was too sentimental, too realistic, too graceful or grimy, too secular or nothing but a propagandist for the Catholic church. Which is where most people happen upon his art today, reduced to the size of a prayer card. </p> <p>After all that, it comes as quite a surprise to stand where Ruskin once stood and find the view so unimposing and mild. Dulwich owns three Murillos: two groups of ragged kids and a Virgin and Child that seems to have been worked in tinted Vaseline. Though the gallery doubtless loves them as much as Hazlitt did, they represent the tail end of Murillo's career, when his pictures were flaccid, illogical or hard to read; who knows exactly what those children are playing at? </p> <p>You aren't asked to worry about that if you visit this show because those paintings are left to fend for themselves in the main collection. Instead, the gallery has borrowed 20 other Murillos and hung them beautifully, in intimate little rooms next to pictures by his Spanish contemporaries. Right away, you see how innovative he was in an early picture on loan from the Louvre, in which a boy with a crew cut and tattered rags sits in the ruins of a derelict building. </p> <p>Murillo has taken something from Vel\u00e1zquez in the fine light that circles the rim of a water jug and the glinting prawn husks that litter the floor. But look at the dust on the soles of his feet - it's both ingrained and newly acquired - and you understand why Manet admired Murillo's singular 'studies in dirt'. Everything is empathetic to this boy's experience, from the awkward pose to the down-turned, introspective face. Even the hot light shafting through a broken window emphasises his isolation, alone and hidden on a summer day. </p> <p>This is not a generalised illustration of poverty, but a study of one particular child. He went on to paint more ingratiating pictures, in which urchins seem to have been hired to smile at the viewer or chuckle sweetly at the antics of dogs. He understood something about children away from parents, having been an orphan himself. But it's only when he bypasses the grown-ups - his patrons - that this knowledge comes into effect. </p> <p>Take the two boys stuffing their faces with fruit in some rocky landscape outside the city. They are surrounded by the battered and spent: junked rinds, scattered seeds, frayed rags, broken wicker. If you want poverty, it's there in every patch of the canvas. But it's immaterial to the central image, namely, the way children like to keep a beady eye on each other while eating, partly because it's funny, but also out of sheer fascination to see their own actions reproduced in copycat. </p> <p>This painting just doesn't square with the notion of Murillo as all schmaltz. Nor do the two really startling pictures in this show, both on loan from America. In The Galicians, two women are looking out of a large open window. One has settled into position, leaning over the sill. The other is just arriving from the dark interior of the room. That they're fixed on you is not in doubt; the beautiful girl at the sill offers her most winning gaze, while the older woman clutches a coy veil to her laughing mouth. It's a marvellous image: soft light playing over the girl's glowing skin, pale bodice and scarlet ribbons, and reaching just far enough into the room to illuminate the veil before vanishing into deep shadow. </p> <p>You can see why the curators find echoes of Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya and Manet here, from the interior space to the angled back of the shutters. But there's something unfamiliar and odd. Unlike the faces in portraits, these Galicians are doing all the looking: they aren't just returning your gaze. </p> <p>Murillo takes this even further with Four Figures on a Step, a frankly alarming picture. Again, there's a double time scheme. The old woman on the right, her penetrating stare magnified behind massive spectacles, has clearly been there for a while, nursing an urchin's head in her lap. The dandy on the left has just rushed forward to thrust his opportunistic mug in your face, while the girl behind him has caught up only to discover that it's you again, if that's what her face-pulling registers. </p> <p>The relationship between these people is completely enigmatic. Two of them also ignore the central child with the hole in his trouser-seat, unignorable from our point of view. But that's just it: we are strangely more intriguing than the child to them, at least for this passing moment. </p> <p>Murillo's pictorial imagination proves wonderfully flexible, creating an equal tension between viewer and painted viewer. What's going on with these people is anyone's guess - and they seem to feel the same about you.</p>",

      "byline": "Peter Conrad",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Usually Puccini's Turandot confronts you, like Hitchcock's Mrs Bates, at the top of a staircase, armed not with a knife but a lethal fusillade of high Cs, discharged to fend off importunate wooers. Jane Eaglen, who returns to the Royal Opera tomorrow to sing this killingly difficult role, also awaited me on the stairs. Puffing up to the third floor in a London mansion block, I heard her clearing her throat somewhere above, and wondered what to expect. </p> <p>Instead of Puccini's man-eater, I found a jolly, welcoming and resplendently plump young woman. 'I should,' she admitted, 'be chopping off the Prince of Persia's head round about now.' That is Turandot's first action in the opera, achieved by silently giving her spurned suitor the thumbs down; but Eaglen, with nothing to sing in this scene, had been excused from the morning's rehearsal. Rather than indulging in a spot of decapitation, she made me a cup of coffee. </p> <p>Eaglen last sang with the Royal Opera in 1992. For the rest of the decade the management ignored her, despite her successes in roles as testing as Bellini's Norma in Ravenna and New York, Weber's Rezia in Oberon in Salzburg, and Wagner's Br\u00fcnnhilde and Isolde at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1989 the Royal Opera had asked her to understudy the chronically capricious Margaret Price in Norma . 'First she didn't want to rehearse with the chorus. Then some days she wouldn't come in at all, so I did more and more of the preparation. Finally it opened, and she cancelled one performance. Twice during the day they told me I was going on, but meanwhile they were trying to find someone who could fly in to save the show. John Pritchard, who was conducting, thought I wouldn't have the constitution or the nerves to do it. Was he wrong! Eventually in mid-afternoon they found a replacement in Germany, and sent me home. I was bitterly disappointed. But at least they gave me a bottle of champagne.' She nonchalantly shrugged off the memory of that particular rejection. </p> <p>Born in Lincoln, Eaglen all the same feistily insists: 'I'm not an English singer.' By which she means she's not chaste and churchy-sounding. Since her marriage a year ago - to a fan she met at a Tower Records signing session - she has been based in Seattle, but her repatriation, at least partially, is under way. In September she even impersonated Britannia in a rollicking, coloratura-ridden self-parody at the Last Night of the Proms. The English National Opera is putting on Spontini's La Vestale - 'a mini-Norma ', she says, about a somewhat tainted Vestal virgin - for her next season, though after Turandot there are no more plans for Covent Garden: a rumoured Isolde has evaporated, and it saddens her that she won't have the chance to sing Wagner in England. </p> <p>Even so, intending to spend more time here from now on, she has invested in a rowing machine, which sprawls expectantly on the floor inside the front door. I doubt whether it will get much use. Eaglen, who has a sound mind in a very sound body, takes a defiant pride in her size. </p> <p>Her humour is earthy, her personality grounded, even though her job requires her to dress up as spear-wielding goddesses or as 'that ice cow princess' (which is how she describes Turandot). 'Opera is entertainment, it's not brain surgery,' she said to me. 'I had a working-class upbringing, and I'm proud of that too. We only got an inside toilet when I was about 10. My father worked in a steel foundry and ran the local soccer team. Perhaps that's why I'm such a sports fan. I'm crazy about baseball, and I can see a connection between hitting a home run and singing a high C: it's the same sort of achievement. </p> <p>'I'm going up to Lincoln to fetch my mother down to see Turandot . She was 80 last week, and she's not too interested in opera, but luckily this one's short.' </p> <p>Her mother, despite this indifference to opera, seems certain of a place in backstage lore. A while ago she travelled to New York to see her daughter in Turandot with Pavarotti. The night before, Eaglen prepped her by telling her the plot, and tried out on her the riddles with which Turandot lethally quizzes her suitors. One clue refers to 'a flame that is not a flame'. The answer, predictably enough, is love, but her mother, after a long period of cogitation, brightly asked 'Could it be mustard?' At the premiere, Pavarotti presented Eaglen with 10 pots of mustard. She doesn't even like the stuff, she told me, and gave it all away. </p> <p>Strong-minded herself, she requires her characters to be so too. Singing Isolde, she relishes the sarcastic raillery with which she addresses Tristan. 'I love it when she says \"And guess what, you killed my lover and sent me his head in a box. That was so nice of you!\" Isn't that a great line?' </p> <p>She has no regrets about bypassing the younger Wagner heroines - for instance the ardent Sieglinde, a rival to the war-like Br\u00fcnnhilde in Die Walk\u00fcre: 'She's a wimp. You want to give her a good slap when she starts with the hysterics. But funnily enough, it's always the soprano singing Sieglinde who has a limo waiting at the stage door. Poor old Br\u00fcnnhilde just trudges to the corner and hails a cab.' </p> <p>She also has doubts about the martyred heroines of Verdi. 'I'm not a simperer - though I am doing Aida soon, and she grovels a lot and apologises, which is not my line. She always seems to be kneeling. Well, I'm fit and supple, I can kneel - but should I?' </p> <p>She will not, I predict, look very Ethiopian. 'The important thing,' she chuckled, 'is to make sure the costume has sleeves. Then you don't have to do much blacking-up!' </p> <p>Eaglen has often been criticised for her immobility on stage. Dionysian frenzy is not an option for her; meeting her, you come to respect the monumental placidity of a woman who stands apart from the esoteric mania of her own artform. She is happy to be remembered in Lincoln as Ron Eaglen's daughter, and shakes her head over the besotted fans for whom opera resembles a religious cult. 'It's only around the Met that anyone recognises me in the street. Once I was getting money from a cash machine on Broadway, and I could sense these people hovering behind me. When I turned round, they gushed \"Oh, we just loved your Isolde\", but all I could think of was \"Did they see my PIN number?\" ' </p> <p>Like many singers, she whiles away the hours of solitary confinement in hotel rooms by idling through cyberspace, and is aghast at the 'evil energy' she finds in the chat rooms where the aficionados exchange tittle-tattle. 'They do write sick things about me sometimes, but I try not to take it seriously. There was a rumour circulating on the internet that I'd done a run of Don Giovanni performances without any underwear!' </p> <p>She tried to look sternly disapproving, then burst into rorty laughter at the thought. But the libel reminded her of a Turandot in Bologna, when - after spending the first two acts riding on an elevator, with just her head peeping out into view through a metal globe - she was finally set free to walk around wearing a costume with a train which had 10 dancers hidden beneath it to make it move. 'So you had 10 Italians up your legs,' I commented. 'Was that fun?' 'Not really,' she said with a guffaw. 'It did get a bit ticklish!' </p> <p>Turandot is a gelid monster, encased in ice; Jane Eaglen, I suspect, is a red-hot mama. </p> <p> Turandot opens tomorrow and continues in rep until 19 March at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (0207 304 4000)</p>",

Then some days she wouldn't come in at all, so I did more and more of the preparation. Finally it opened, and she cancelled one performance. Twice during the day they told me I was going on, but meanwhile they were trying to find someone who could fly in to save the show. John Pritchard, who was conducting, thought I wouldn't have the constitution or the nerves to do it. Was he wrong! Eventually in mid-afternoon they found a replacement in Germany, and sent me home. I was bitterly disappointed. But at least they gave me a bottle of champagne.' She nonchalantly shrugged off the memory of that particular rejection. Born in Lincoln, Eaglen all the same feistily insists: 'I'm not an English singer.' By which she means she's not chaste and churchy-sounding. Since her marriage a year ago - to a fan she met at a Tower Records signing session - she has been based in Seattle, but her repatriation, at least partially, is under way. In September she even impersonated Britannia in a rollicking, coloratura-ridden self-parody at the Last Night of the Proms. The English National Opera is putting on Spontini's La Vestale - 'a mini-Norma ', she says, about a somewhat tainted Vestal virgin - for her next season, though after Turandot there are no more plans for Covent Garden: a rumoured Isolde has evaporated, and it saddens her that she won't have the chance to sing Wagner in England. Even so, intending to spend more time here from now on, she has invested in a rowing machine, which sprawls expectantly on the floor inside the front door. I doubt whether it will get much use. Eaglen, who has a sound mind in a very sound body, takes a defiant pride in her size. Her humour is earthy, her personality grounded, even though her job requires her to dress up as spear-wielding goddesses or as 'that ice cow princess' (which is how she describes Turandot). 'Opera is entertainment, it's not brain surgery,' she said to me. 'I had a working-class upbringing, and I'm proud of that too. We only got an inside toilet when I was about 10. My father worked in a steel foundry and ran the local soccer team. Perhaps that's why I'm such a sports fan. I'm crazy about baseball, and I can see a connection between hitting a home run and singing a high C: it's the same sort of achievement. 'I'm going up to Lincoln to fetch my mother down to see Turandot . She was 80 last week, and she's not too interested in opera, but luckily this one's short.' Her mother, despite this indifference to opera, seems certain of a place in backstage lore. A while ago she travelled to New York to see her daughter in Turandot with Pavarotti. The night before, Eaglen prepped her by telling her the plot, and tried out on her the riddles with which Turandot lethally quizzes her suitors. One clue refers to 'a flame that is not a flame'. The answer, predictably enough, is love, but her mother, after a long period of cogitation, brightly asked 'Could it be mustard?' At the premiere, Pavarotti presented Eaglen with 10 pots of mustard. She doesn't even like the stuff, she told me, and gave it all away. Strong-minded herself, she requires her characters to be so too. Singing Isolde, she relishes the sarcastic raillery with which she addresses Tristan. 'I love it when she says \"And guess what, you killed my lover and sent me his head in a box. That was so nice of you!\" Isn't that a great line?' She has no regrets about bypassing the younger Wagner heroines - for instance the ardent Sieglinde, a rival to the war-like Br\u00fcnnhilde in Die Walk\u00fcre: 'She's a wimp. You want to give her a good slap when she starts with the hysterics. But funnily enough, it's always the soprano singing Sieglinde who has a limo waiting at the stage door. Poor old Br\u00fcnnhilde just trudges to the corner and hails a cab.' She also has doubts about the martyred heroines of Verdi. 'I'm not a simperer - though I am doing Aida soon, and she grovels a lot and apologises, which is not my line. She always seems to be kneeling. Well, I'm fit and supple, I can kneel - but should I?' She will not, I predict, look very Ethiopian. 'The important thing,' she chuckled, 'is to make sure the costume has sleeves. Then you don't have to do much blacking-up!' Eaglen has often been criticised for her immobility on stage. Dionysian frenzy is not an option for her; meeting her, you come to respect the monumental placidity of a woman who stands apart from the esoteric mania of her own artform. She is happy to be remembered in Lincoln as Ron Eaglen's daughter, and shakes her head over the besotted fans for whom opera resembles a religious cult. 'It's only around the Met that anyone recognises me in the street. Once I was getting money from a cash machine on Broadway, and I could sense these people hovering behind me. When I turned round, they gushed \"Oh, we just loved your Isolde\", but all I could think of was \"Did they see my PIN number?\" ' Like many singers, she whiles away the hours of solitary confinement in hotel rooms by idling through cyberspace, and is aghast at the 'evil energy' she finds in the chat rooms where the aficionados exchange tittle-tattle. 'They do write sick things about me sometimes, but I try not to take it seriously. There was a rumour circulating on the internet that I'd done a run of Don Giovanni performances without any underwear!' She tried to look sternly disapproving, then burst into rorty laughter at the thought. But the libel reminded her of a Turandot in Bologna, when - after spending the first two acts riding on an elevator, with just her head peeping out into view through a metal globe - she was finally set free to walk around wearing a costume with a train which had 10 dancers hidden beneath it to make it move. 'So you had 10 Italians up your legs,' I commented. 'Was that fun?' 'Not really,' she said with a guffaw. 'It did get a bit ticklish!' Turandot is a gelid monster, encased in ice; Jane Eaglen, I suspect, is a red-hot mama. Turandot opens tomorrow and continues in rep until 19 March at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (0207 304 4000)",

You have been through it, the characters have been through it. But through what exactly? </p> <p>Pirandello's teasing 1921 masterpiece begins with six characters turning up out of the blue, looking for an author. Nothing else in the play can compete with the moment of their arrival, beautifully refined here by Jones. A screen (upon whichslides on the life of Pirandello have just been shown) is slit down the middle and the characters step through it. They all wear black, in mourning for their lack of a life. They are almost comic, almost tragic. But, denied a decent plot, they can never convincingly be either. The characters break in on a group of actors and a director and thus begins a dazzling examination of what is meant by reality. Unsteadily, the realisation dawns: the characters' dilemma is not as different from our own as we might wish. Who is in charge of the plot of our lives? </p> <p>Giles's Cadle's set is wonderful: the Young Vic has converted itself from the round to a proscenium stage (which is wide and long) and the audience is seated on pert red and gold ballroom chairs. Overhead hang two chandeliers (and even they behave unconventionally). I loved the symbolic opening: a projected black and white photograph of a writer's hands tapping on to an ancient typewriter before pulling out the page and screwing it up. There is a burst of opera, then nothing. </p> <p>The father (Stephen Boxer) looks as though his features have set. He is a stickler for correctness: suffering, pedantic, not without desire. The mother (Yolanda Vasquez) maintains a tragic attitude throughout, to troubling effect. But it is the stepdaughter (Leah Muller) who is the energetic heart of the piece. She is like a giant child, with a slash of scarlet lipstick for a mouth - she could have escaped from a Paula Rego painting. She is tremendous. Her sexuality is free-range, underplotted, as if promiscuity came from a lack of narrative direction. </p> <p>All the 'characters' frustrate and compel: they veer alarmingly between confession and sales pitch, trying to interest the director in their broken piece of story. The 'actors' have a satisfied, lofty look: they wear minks and netted, top-heavy hats. The leading lady (Liza Sadovy) kisses the air and looks pleased with life. The younger actress (Elizabeth Hopley) is flaxen, debonair: amusingly certain she can act her rivals off the stage. The hilarious stage manageress (Catherine Malone) runs around in an unproductive panic. The director (Darrel D'Silva) is desperate and it is hardly surprising he ends up with blood on his hands. But Jones and his cast come out smelling of roses. </p> <p>The play that made Timberlake Wertenbaker's name, Our Country's Good (1989), was about convicts sent to a military settlement in Australia, in the late eighteenth century. Her new play, <strong> Credible Witness</strong>, is about modern-day asylum seekers in Britain. She has always been drawn to exile as a subject. But why has she herself been exiled to the theatre upstairs at the Royal Court when once she would have been on the main stage? It is a puzzle - for her play is something to write home about. </p> <p>Olympia Dukakis gives a stupendous performance as Petra Karagy, the Macedonian mother who has flown to England to search for her son. She is absolutely convincing: it is as if she has strayed into the Royal Court, mistaking it for Heathrow. She is a mother to end all mothers, holding on to her history as tightly as her handbag. Wertenbaker asks: how much does history matter? Might it turn out to be excess baggage? But she will not permit herself the security of definitive answers. </p> <p>The most powerful scenes are between Petra and Simon, a self-pitying immigration officer (skilfully played by Clive Merrison). He has acquired the official's habit of talking to other people as he were the only person in the room. But he is diminished by the astonishing Petra. Adam Kotz is marvellous as Petra's son, a teacher with ideals which do not suit his life in exile. The play has the balance it needs to contain its different elements, its refugees and their histories: Aziz from Algeria is wonderfully played by Anthony Barclay who makes his lunacy lively; Vincent Ebrahim's Shivan is impressive too and Ameena from Somalia (Leona Ekembe) is memorable as she breaks her own silence, reveals the cigarette burns on her body, and becomes the credible witness of the title. </p> <p>I saw <strong> Fourteen Songs, Two Weddings and a Funeral</strong> on Valentine's Day. It was fun to reflect upon arranged marriages on a day when Cupid likes to do his worst, and the musical was greeted by the audience with rapture. Tamasha (the Asian theatre company) have based their drama on the Bollywood film Hum Aapke Hain Koun, about one arranged marriage and one misarranged one. </p> <p>Mala Ghedia is delightful as Nisha, in a sparkling cardigan with character to match. She pretends to mock Prem (cheeky Pushpinder Chani). But no one is fooled. Meanwhile, Nisha's beautiful sister Pooja (Meneka Das) and Prem's relative Rajesh (Shammi Aulakh) are brought together. The awk wardness of their arranged union is nicely conveyed, a combination of bonhomie, bashfulness and hilarity. </p> <p>The soundtrack is by the original 1998 cast, with the result that the actors sometimes look like enthusiastic goldfish, but nothing spoils the charm of the show. Indeed, the frisky vitality of Kristine Landon-Smith's production is such that when tragedy strikes and Pooja dies unexpectedly, plummeting down a flight of stairs, it is intensely funny, not least because she has just been singing a perky song called 'Here I go'... </p> <p> Susannah Clapp is on holiday</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Who is, or was, Michael Landy? He is a man who until last week possessed more art works than clothes, although he was also quite a dandy dresser. Many of the art works were his own, and some were by other young British artists: by his Turner prize-winning girlfriend Gillian Wearing, by Gary Hume, by Chris Ofili, Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst. He owned more than one Savile Row suit, some Patrick Cox shoes, and his underwear was Calvin Klein. He once lived, worked, or at least removed the locks from 7-9 Fashion Street in London's East End. Judging by the contents of his kitchen, he was a keen chef and, until last week, he still had a mincemeat grinder he inherited from his mother. He banks with NatWest. He sends his love letters by fax. He lost his mobile phone in Heathrow airport and stole a calculator from an art gallery. His social circle includes at least one minor royal and a number of artists, one of whose forgotten swimming trunks he never returned. He has travelled widely (Turkey, Ireland, Greece), but cannot now seem to find his passport. There is evidence to suggest that he reads The Observer and supports West Ham.</p> <p>But now Michael Landy is a man who is destroying this evidence. You will find a record of it in an inventory he has made of every item he possesses. He has given each a number, bagged those that will fit in plastic, and pasted the inventory up on a wall in what used to be C&amp;A on Oxford Street, near Marble Arch. All this week, you can go there and watch Landy dispose of his life. His car, his art archive, his family photographs - everything, as the windows of this very department store shouted only recently, must go.</p> <p>Stretched out behind the big shop windows, between empty clothes racks and deserted escalators, is Landy's public art installation, entitled Breakdown. He has built a conveyor belt and designed it to look like a gigantic toy train set or futuristic factory. It is painted turquoise blue, laden with bright yellow plastic crates containing his things, and is operated by men and women wearing matching blue boiler suits. The same objects go round and round: a shredded pair of 'indestructible' Levi 501s, his father's sheepskin coat, which has remained untouched for days, a dissected rubber lobster with its echo of Salvador Dali. There is a bay for his Saab, another for large objects, a place to put his stereo and an alcove for weighing and logging every item.</p> <p>There is a happy, Mike and the Mechanics sort of atmosphere. The music is his; it has been catalogued and will eventually go too. Huge machines drive the fantasy factory, which is based on material reclamation facilities - a shredder, a granulator and various drills. The aesthetic is one of manufacture but the activity is its opposite: these things are being sorted and taken apart. The whole effect is of a forensic investigation being conducted in an airport, except in this case the luggage is not being reclaimed but disclaimed. The new Michael Landy, it seems to be saying, will come with no baggage.</p> <p>Landy's stated objective is to comment on consumerism, to show us how attached we are to our possessions and how we tend to define ourselves according to the stuff that surrounds us. Retail is even called therapy.</p> <p>This installation, commissioned by Artangel, the organisation behind Rachel Whiteread's House, is closely related to many of his others. Closing Down Sale (1992) featured laminated signs that read 'Buy Now', 'Massive Clearance Sale', '\u00a3s off'. Scrapheap Services, which was bought by the Tate in 1996, was composed of a waste-disposal team clearing up heaps of little people cut out of branded packaging - Boddington's, Coca-Cola, KFC. Landy even designed a satirical logo to make anti-corporate culture-jammers proud: a 'Keep Britain Tidy' spoof in which the object being thrown into the rubbish bin is a tiny person. In 1997 he created the Tate Gallery's Christmas tree: a heap of mauled toys and gluttonous waste, a prediction of Boxing Day fall-out. So close to life has Landy's satire been that one exhibition was slightly scuppered when the gallery's cleaners took it to be rubbish and threw parts of it away. A spokesperson for the cleaning contractors at the time offered a sharp piece of art criticism along with her apology: 'What is rubbish to me is art to somebody else. You have to be very careful.'</p> <p>Landy's critics have found his work a little preachy, slightly holier-than-thou, while his supporters believe him to be one of the few truly political artists working in Britain at the moment. It could easily be said that Landy is destroying possessions he could be giving to the dispossessed, and that Oxford Street is filled with homeless people as well as consumers. In fact, Landy will not be left with nothing next week: he is exchanging what he owns for cultural capital - he will be a better, and better-known, artist at the end of it.</p> <p>But this installation is undeniably uncompromising: some of Landy's friends are concerned about him getting rid of his own work, which, quite aside from the question of prospective art history, was all potential revenue (his drawings are valued at up to \u00a36,000 each, and there are hundreds of them). Other friends are worried about their own work going (the Gary Hume painting is worth \u00a320,000). The car was not an old banger, but, I am told, in perfectly good nick.</p> <p>Landy himself says: 'I'm not here to make people feel guilty or bad - that's not really my role.' He also says that the fact that people care about the value of things is part of the show, part of the interactive point he is making. 'There is a theatre in it,' Landy says. 'You can see people coming in from Oxford Street, and they are still acting as shoppers - they see things going round and they think, oh, I'd like that, or I don't like that. And it was important to me that the only thing you can take away from this is your experience of it. It doesn't get commodified. It's not for sale. Often with contemporary art people get sidetracked - instead of talking about their experience of it they just talk about how much it is.'</p> <p>What makes Breakdown a triumph, I think, is that beyond its political message it has a number of accidental components. It is not just a comment on consumerism; it can at times be quite funny. It is also a rumination on the nature of memory and identity, and as such it is totally unpredictable to Landy, totally out of his grasp. He has created something that continues to work despite him, a monster almost. He vowed to destroy all his possessions, but he didn't know how he would feel about doing it, and he has found surprises in the process.</p> <p>'I'm going to kill the operative who destroys my dad's coat.' We are having a cup of tea in what used to be C&amp;A's fitting rooms. Landy calls the people in boiler suits 'operatives'. There are about 12 of them working on Breakdown - most of them are art students or artists; Dave Nutt, who is taking apart the car, is a Saab mechanic.</p> <p>'I thought you were destroying everything,' I say.</p> <p>'I am, but, some things are harder to part with. I think that coat's going to be the last to go.' The brown sheepskin coat, carefully folded in a yellow crate, belonged to his father in the Seventies. He bought it when he was 37, the same age Landy is now, and it was so expensive he had to pay it off in installments. But soon afterwards, he had a serious accident at work, and the coat was too heavy and uncomfortable for him to wear. It took Landy's mother a whole year to pay it off; Landy was too small to wear it then, but it fits him now, now that he is about to destroy it. 'I did say at the beginning to all the people working here to try and do it as lovingly as they possibly can,' Landy says.</p> <p>A drill whizzes loudly on the shop floor. Landy looks around. 'It's funny sitting here nonchalantly having a cup of tea as someone jigsaws my tumble dryer.' Gail, who is working on the sofa, comes in looking for a plaster from the first aid kit. 'It's really enjoyable taking apart well-made things,' she complains, 'but Michael's sofa is just stapled together.' She says that at the beginning they were all really gung-ho about taking things to pieces, but after a couple of days they started getting attached to Michael's things: 'You're sad to see them go.'</p> <p>Landy explains that everyone has taken on certain roles within the breakdown system. Clive is in charge of all the shredding and granulating. Jakob, an iconoclast, takes particular pleasure in destroying the artworks. Barry does the cat toys because he hates cats, and Nina works with Dave on the car, arranging the parts in the crates in aesthetically pleasing ways. 'I do find the way Barry tears up my photographs quite disturbing,' Landy comments. 'And he takes coins and scratches the faces on them - it's like vandalism.' Barry used to come to this C&amp;A all the way from Northampton as a kid. Now he's a mature art student, having had a career as a chemical engineer. 'I've worked in a textile factory,' he says, 'and I can tell you that the management-worker relations here are exactly the same. This really is a microcosm of industrial life.'</p> <p>Dave Nutt stands out from the rest: he's wearing a dark blue suit and baseball cap. I ask him what he can tell about Landy from the car. 'I'll tell you what I know about Michael - he's the kind of guy who pays 500 quid for someone to fix his car with a drinking straw. Honestly - I found a drinking straw in it! That's why the turbo wasn't working.'</p> <p>Apart from being a Saab mechanic, Dave is also a practising Tibetan Buddhist. As he tells me about the renunciate path it becomes clear that he has become a sort of spokesman for the entire installation. 'It's like death,' he says, offering me an organic fruity digestive. 'Death is non-negotiable.'</p> <p>'You could say this is a suicide piece,' Landy reflects, 'but I don't think it is. I see it as very joyous. In some respects this is a full-stop. But hopefully it will be another beginning. My major investment is that I've spent three years working on this project and I've got two weeks to live with it, and enjoy it.'</p> <p>I ask him what is left at his home. 'Just Gillian's stuff,' he says. All sorts of things have changed in the few days he has been doing Breakdown: he keeps looking at his watch and finding a bare wrist, he has blisters on his feet from walking everywhere, he has no clothes but the boilersuit on his back.</p> <p>I ask him if the evidence, and the inventory, add up to a true picture of who he is. 'Yeh,' he replies, 'I'm an artist, and I have my own interests, and none of them are embarrassing. There's nothing on there that's actually really embarrassing' - he pauses - 'apart from a Phil Collins single... and some underwear that was slightly the worse for wear.</p> <p>'I'd like to have had more love letters, but the first girlfriend I ever went out with demanded the letters back. And more things from when I was younger - from seven or eight up until the age of 18 - I'd like to have had more things like that, to build a picture of what I used to be like when I was younger.' When he found some things of his in his father's loft recently, he sat looking over his youth, remembering friends, tastes, experiences. That, I suggest, is the last time he'll be able to do such a thing, but Landy doesn't care, either about the sentimentalism or about posterity. 'This is a celebration of a life, but I'm still alive. People come in who I haven't seen for years. It's really nice. I'm happy every day. It's like my own funeral, but I'm alive to watch it.'</p> <p>Breakdown is on at C&amp;A, 499-523 Oxford Street, London W1, until Saturday</p>",

      "bodyText": "Who is, or was, Michael Landy? He is a man who until last week possessed more art works than clothes, although he was also quite a dandy dresser. Many of the art works were his own, and some were by other young British artists: by his Turner prize-winning girlfriend Gillian Wearing, by Gary Hume, by Chris Ofili, Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst. He owned more than one Savile Row suit, some Patrick Cox shoes, and his underwear was Calvin Klein. He once lived, worked, or at least removed the locks from 7-9 Fashion Street in London's East End. Judging by the contents of his kitchen, he was a keen chef and, until last week, he still had a mincemeat grinder he inherited from his mother. He banks with NatWest. He sends his love letters by fax. He lost his mobile phone in Heathrow airport and stole a calculator from an art gallery. His social circle includes at least one minor royal and a number of artists, one of whose forgotten swimming trunks he never returned. He has travelled widely (Turkey, Ireland, Greece), but cannot now seem to find his passport. There is evidence to suggest that he reads The Observer and supports West Ham. But now Michael Landy is a man who is destroying this evidence. You will find a record of it in an inventory he has made of every item he possesses. He has given each a number, bagged those that will fit in plastic, and pasted the inventory up on a wall in what used to be C&amp;A on Oxford Street, near Marble Arch. All this week, you can go there and watch Landy dispose of his life. His car, his art archive, his family photographs - everything, as the windows of this very department store shouted only recently, must go. Stretched out behind the big shop windows, between empty clothes racks and deserted escalators, is Landy's public art installation, entitled Breakdown. He has built a conveyor belt and designed it to look like a gigantic toy train set or futuristic factory. It is painted turquoise blue, laden with bright yellow plastic crates containing his things, and is operated by men and women wearing matching blue boiler suits. The same objects go round and round: a shredded pair of 'indestructible' Levi 501s, his father's sheepskin coat, which has remained untouched for days, a dissected rubber lobster with its echo of Salvador Dali. There is a bay for his Saab, another for large objects, a place to put his stereo and an alcove for weighing and logging every item. There is a happy, Mike and the Mechanics sort of atmosphere. The music is his; it has been catalogued and will eventually go too. Huge machines drive the fantasy factory, which is based on material reclamation facilities - a shredder, a granulator and various drills. The aesthetic is one of manufacture but the activity is its opposite: these things are being sorted and taken apart. The whole effect is of a forensic investigation being conducted in an airport, except in this case the luggage is not being reclaimed but disclaimed. The new Michael Landy, it seems to be saying, will come with no baggage. Landy's stated objective is to comment on consumerism, to show us how attached we are to our possessions and how we tend to define ourselves according to the stuff that surrounds us. Retail is even called therapy. This installation, commissioned by Artangel, the organisation behind Rachel Whiteread's House, is closely related to many of his others. Closing Down Sale (1992) featured laminated signs that read 'Buy Now', 'Massive Clearance Sale', '\u00a3s off'. Scrapheap Services, which was bought by the Tate in 1996, was composed of a waste-disposal team clearing up heaps of little people cut out of branded packaging - Boddington's, Coca-Cola, KFC. Landy even designed a satirical logo to make anti-corporate culture-jammers proud: a 'Keep Britain Tidy' spoof in which the object being thrown into the rubbish bin is a tiny person. In 1997 he created the Tate Gallery's Christmas tree: a heap of mauled toys and gluttonous waste, a prediction of Boxing Day fall-out. So close to life has Landy's satire been that one exhibition was slightly scuppered when the gallery's cleaners took it to be rubbish and threw parts of it away. A spokesperson for the cleaning contractors at the time offered a sharp piece of art criticism along with her apology: 'What is rubbish to me is art to somebody else. You have to be very careful.' Landy's critics have found his work a little preachy, slightly holier-than-thou, while his supporters believe him to be one of the few truly political artists working in Britain at the moment. It could easily be said that Landy is destroying possessions he could be giving to the dispossessed, and that Oxford Street is filled with homeless people as well as consumers. In fact, Landy will not be left with nothing next week: he is exchanging what he owns for cultural capital - he will be a better, and better-known, artist at the end of it. But this installation is undeniably uncompromising: some of Landy's friends are concerned about him getting rid of his own work, which, quite aside from the question of prospective art history, was all potential revenue (his drawings are valued at up to \u00a36,000 each, and there are hundreds of them). Other friends are worried about their own work going (the Gary Hume painting is worth \u00a320,000). The car was not an old banger, but, I am told, in perfectly good nick. Landy himself says: 'I'm not here to make people feel guilty or bad - that's not really my role.' He also says that the fact that people care about the value of things is part of the show, part of the interactive point he is making. 'There is a theatre in it,' Landy says. 'You can see people coming in from Oxford Street, and they are still acting as shoppers - they see things going round and they think, oh, I'd like that, or I don't like that. And it was important to me that the only thing you can take away from this is your experience of it. It doesn't get commodified. It's not for sale. Often with contemporary art people get sidetracked - instead of talking about their experience of it they just talk about how much it is.' What makes Breakdown a triumph, I think, is that beyond its political message it has a number of accidental components. It is not just a comment on consumerism; it can at times be quite funny. It is also a rumination on the nature of memory and identity, and as such it is totally unpredictable to Landy, totally out of his grasp. He has created something that continues to work despite him, a monster almost. He vowed to destroy all his possessions, but he didn't know how he would feel about doing it, and he has found surprises in the process. 'I'm going to kill the operative who destroys my dad's coat.' We are having a cup of tea in what used to be C&amp;A's fitting rooms. Landy calls the people in boiler suits 'operatives'. There are about 12 of them working on Breakdown - most of them are art students or artists; Dave Nutt, who is taking apart the car, is a Saab mechanic. 'I thought you were destroying everything,' I say. 'I am, but, some things are harder to part with. I think that coat's going to be the last to go.' The brown sheepskin coat, carefully folded in a yellow crate, belonged to his father in the Seventies. He bought it when he was 37, the same age Landy is now, and it was so expensive he had to pay it off in installments. But soon afterwards, he had a serious accident at work, and the coat was too heavy and uncomfortable for him to wear. It took Landy's mother a whole year to pay it off; Landy was too small to wear it then, but it fits him now, now that he is about to destroy it. 'I did say at the beginning to all the people working here to try and do it as lovingly as they possibly can,' Landy says. A drill whizzes loudly on the shop floor. Landy looks around. 'It's funny sitting here nonchalantly having a cup of tea as someone jigsaws my tumble dryer.' Gail, who is working on the sofa, comes in looking for a plaster from the first aid kit. 'It's really enjoyable taking apart well-made things,' she complains, 'but Michael's sofa is just stapled together.' She says that at the beginning they were all really gung-ho about taking things to pieces, but after a couple of days they started getting attached to Michael's things: 'You're sad to see them go.' Landy explains that everyone has taken on certain roles within the breakdown system. Clive is in charge of all the shredding and granulating. Jakob, an iconoclast, takes particular pleasure in destroying the artworks. Barry does the cat toys because he hates cats, and Nina works with Dave on the car, arranging the parts in the crates in aesthetically pleasing ways. 'I do find the way Barry tears up my photographs quite disturbing,' Landy comments. 'And he takes coins and scratches the faces on them - it's like vandalism.' Barry used to come to this C&amp;A all the way from Northampton as a kid. Now he's a mature art student, having had a career as a chemical engineer. 'I've worked in a textile factory,' he says, 'and I can tell you that the management-worker relations here are exactly the same. This really is a microcosm of industrial life.' Dave Nutt stands out from the rest: he's wearing a dark blue suit and baseball cap. I ask him what he can tell about Landy from the car. 'I'll tell you what I know about Michael - he's the kind of guy who pays 500 quid for someone to fix his car with a drinking straw. Honestly - I found a drinking straw in it! That's why the turbo wasn't working.' Apart from being a Saab mechanic, Dave is also a practising Tibetan Buddhist. As he tells me about the renunciate path it becomes clear that he has become a sort of spokesman for the entire installation. 'It's like death,' he says, offering me an organic fruity digestive. 'Death is non-negotiable.' 'You could say this is a suicide piece,' Landy reflects, 'but I don't think it is. I see it as very joyous. In some respects this is a full-stop. But hopefully it will be another beginning. My major investment is that I've spent three years working on this project and I've got two weeks to live with it, and enjoy it.' I ask him what is left at his home. 'Just Gillian's stuff,' he says. All sorts of things have changed in the few days he has been doing Breakdown: he keeps looking at his watch and finding a bare wrist, he has blisters on his feet from walking everywhere, he has no clothes but the boilersuit on his back. I ask him if the evidence, and the inventory, add up to a true picture of who he is. 'Yeh,' he replies, 'I'm an artist, and I have my own interests, and none of them are embarrassing. There's nothing on there that's actually really embarrassing' - he pauses - 'apart from a Phil Collins single... and some underwear that was slightly the worse for wear. 'I'd like to have had more love letters, but the first girlfriend I ever went out with demanded the letters back. And more things from when I was younger - from seven or eight up until the age of 18 - I'd like to have had more things like that, to build a picture of what I used to be like when I was younger.' When he found some things of his in his father's loft recently, he sat looking over his youth, remembering friends, tastes, experiences. That, I suggest, is the last time he'll be able to do such a thing, but Landy doesn't care, either about the sentimentalism or about posterity. 'This is a celebration of a life, but I'm still alive. People come in who I haven't seen for years. It's really nice. I'm happy every day. It's like my own funeral, but I'm alive to watch it.' Breakdown is on at C&amp;A, 499-523 Oxford Street, London W1, until Saturday",

      "bodyText": "Two of the Government's most senior figures yesterday attacked Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, for saying that the education system was littered with 'bog standard comprehensives'. In an unprecedented and coordinated move against Campbell - often described as the second most powerful man in the Government behind Tony Blair - John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, and David Blunkett, the Education Secretary, said his criticism undermined improvements in the education system. Both Prescott and Blunkett used speeches at Labour's spring conference in Glasgow to deliver the unprecedented public dressing down. Both men are furious that Campbell's comments, made at the launch of the Government's 10-year education plan last week, overshadowed a raft of policy initiatives. Campbell was also criticised by teaching unions and members of his own party. Senior Labour figures were predicting last night that such an attack by two such well-respected figures in the party would undermine Campbell's position. 'Personally, I am surprised that they both so clearly said it,' one party official said. 'Tony must be angry that this has blown up like this.' Blair arrives in Glasgow today to make his keynote speech and party strategists fear that the row will undermine his appearance. The put-down comes three weeks after Campbell plunged the Government into a furious row when he described Peter Mandelson as 'semi-detached' after the former Northern Ireland Secretary resigned over the Hinduja passports affair. In a briefing to journalists he also suggested that Mandelson was 'unfocused' and that he wanted a complete break from politics. Prescott's direct attack on Campbell came in the middle of his speech to 2,000 Labour Party members. When the audience realised what he was saying, there was applause. 'We all want better standards,' the Deputy Prime Minister said. 'So let's have more substance and less spin. Let's have more talk about specialisation and high standards and less talk about bog-standard provision. We want every school to be a good school.' His criticisms were echoed by Blunkett. The Education Secretary said of the 'bog standard' comment: 'I don't recognise or use the term.' He went on to praise the work secondary schools were doing. But despite the attack, a senior Labour spokesman said that the party still officially stood by the comment, revealing a serious split between three of the most powerful men in the Prime Minister's administration. This division is worrying many officials in the party as the general election approaches.",

But in the storms and heavy seas that affect Orkney, none of the solutions worked. Navy officers have approved the drilling operation as a last resort. Rear Admiral Brian Perowne, head of the naval bases and supply agency, said: 'The leaks have increased dramatically and we have had to change our tactics. Containment is no longer an option. We have got to go in.' MoD chief salvage officer David Keogh added: 'We are confident we can remove the chance of an environmental disaster. It is a tricky operation, not only because we have to preserve the sanctity of the wreck, but also because we are recovering a highly flammable substance and there is always the risk posed by unexploded ordnance. 'We don't know exactly how much oil we are going to get out, but we are confident we are going to get a good result.' Environmentalists, who have expressed concern at the constant leaks, have welcomed the MoD's move. Ross Flett of Orkney Seal Rescue said: 'Scapa Flow is an important area for seals, and while the oil is down there, there is a possibility it could leak from other parts of the ship.' Survivors of the tragedy have approved the operation. Joe Instance, 84, who was badly burnt in the disaster, said: 'The MoD contacted the Royal Oak Survivors' Association and asked what we felt about breaching the hull. We said: \"Just get the damned stuff out of there. It's caused enough problems.\" 'It is not messing about with a war grave. I know the boys down there would have felt the same. The oil caused enough grief in Scapa Flow at the time. Nobody wants it to cause any more.' The operation will be completed by the end of the year.",

      "bodyText": "A man jailed for 27 years for a murder he says he did not commit is set to become a multi-millionaire within weeks, The Observer can reveal. Stephen Downing, a victim of what campaigners describe as one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice, earned just \u00a328 a month before the murder of Wendy Sewell in 1973. Freed on bail at Derbyshire Crown Court two weeks ago, legal experts predict Downing could receive up to \u00a38 million when his High Court appeal to have the conviction quashed is heard. The disclosure came as it was revealed that the net was closing on five local men believed to hold the key to Sewell's death - one of whom is widely believed to be responsible. Sewell, from Bakewell in the Peak District, was murdered in the town cemetery. Downing, a cemetery worker, was subsequently jailed for life, and refused parole because he would not admit his part in the killing. Experts have confirmed that Downing could make four separate claims for compensation: \u0095 Downing was forced to spend 10 years more than the 17-year sentence handed down by the courts in 1973 because his refusal to confess made him ineligible for parole. Claim: around \u00a3900,000. \u0095 The behaviour of Derbyshire police was criticised by the judge at Downing's bail hearing and his arrest was ruled unsafe. Pending a successful appeal, Downing could claim for wrongful arrest and 27 years unlawful detention. Claim: up to \u00a31m. \u0095 Downing could also sue his original lawyers for failing to identify basic faults in the police case which led to his conviction on the basis of a statement which has now been declared unsafe. Claim: \u00a31m. \u0095 If Downing's conviction is quashed by the High Court in the forthcoming appeal, the one-time county council gardener could also sue the Government for unlawful detention. Claim: up to \u00a35m. A sum of up to \u00a3900,000 has secretly been agreed in prin cipal by the Government to partially compensate Downing for the 10 years he spent in jail over his original tariff. 'Stephen is entitled to this money for the 27 years he spent suffering behind bars,' said Don Hale, editor of the local newspaper, the Matlock Mercury , who campaigned ceaselessly over six years for Downing's release despite repeated attempts on his life by those he believes to be the real killers. 'Stephen is not a money grabber but he rightfully feels he is entitled to some compensation,' added Hale, nominated as The Observer 's Man of the Year last December and dubbed the 'Poirot of the Peaks'. According to Hale, Downing will use some of the money to buy a new house for his family in the Bakewell village in which he was born. 'His family is his key concern at the moment,' he said. 'He wants somewhere with more privacy than the small council flat they live in at the moment.' Downing is looking forward to taking his family on holiday to Weymouth.

      "body": "<p>Charlie McCreevy sank back into his comfortable seat and watched the bright early evening lights of the airport flicker past the cabin window of the Brussels-Dublin shuttle as it taxied to the runway for take-off. In a few moments he would be bound for home and, he reflected, a hero's welcome.</p> <p>It had been a gruelling day, but the Ireland's maverick Finance Minister knew the headlines in the country's press the next morning would be generous. McCreevy had been isolated and censured by his peers at last Monday's meeting of European Finance Ministers in Brussels, but he was not for turning.</p> <p>He had defiantly told his EU colleagues he would not abandon Ireland's hugely successful policies of low taxation and economic expansion. Furthermore, he told the disbelieving gathering, the rest of Europe would be better off copying Ireland's success, not criticising it.</p> <p>McCreevy had been summoned to Brussels to receive an unprecedented rebuke from his European partners for pursuing policies that they believe will overheat the already booming Irish economy. Europe's star pupil was being rapped across the knuckles.</p> <p>His defiance last week would have been unimaginable in an Irish Finance Minister 10 years ago, but after a decade of stunning economic growth, Ireland is a country changing at bewildering speed.</p> <p>Where once it tugged its forelock to Europe and held out the begging bowl for structural funds, now it struts with the brash self confidence of the nouveau riche. 'We have come of age,' said Jim O'Leary, chief economist of Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin.</p> <p>Ireland's economic performance has been almost matched by its cultural success. Irish musicians regularly dominate the British charts, from the old hands of U2, to Westlife and The Corrs and emerging stars like 18-year-old R and B singer Samantha Mumba.</p> <p>The country's writers, actors and playwrights have also enjoyed sustained success and international acclaim, while Irish designers such as Louise Kennedy and John Rocha have forced themselves to the forefront of the world fashion industry.</p> <p>Gone are the days of the Clancy Brothers, woolly jumpers and old men sipping pints of the black stuff in quaint old bars: modern Ireland presents itself as young, cool, affluent, self-confident and proud. It can even boast VIP, its very own celebrity magazine, modelled on Hello! and OK!, so that Ireland's new \u00e9lite can invite you into their homes and share their happiness with you. The irony that many of those featured have never been heard of sparks the odd snigger.</p> <p>Throughout the country wealth is ostentatious where once it was hidden away. New car sales have quadrupled, with each year's new licence plate (designated by the year, as in 01, and not by a letter), a 'must have' accessory. Last week in Dublin, top-of-the-range Mercedes jostled with brand new Jaguars on the city's gridlocked streets.</p> <p>House prices have soared by more than 70 per cent in seven years and dinner party conversations are reminiscent of London in the mid 1980s - money, money and more money. British cities such as Glasgow and Liverpool are now rich investment targets for Irish developers with money to spare. Jobs are also plentiful; technology companies advertising in the national press regularly offer salaries of up to IR\u00a3100,000.</p> <p>'This place is awash with cash. People have developed the 'loadsamoney' culture that Britain experienced in the Eighties. Lunch is for wimps, greed is good and everybody wants a slice of the action,' wrote one commentator last month.</p> <p>The benefits of growth have been very real: emigration, the scourge of Ireland for generations, has been replaced by immigration as the booming economy creates more jobs than the Irish can fill. The Ryanair generation, once made up of the young Irish leaving in search of work, has now been replaced by a wave of tourists.</p> <p>Rural towns have been re-vitalised by commuters fleeing Dublin's high prices. Tumbling unemployment, low taxes and low interest rates have spread prosperity wider than ever before.</p> <p>For the first time in their history, the Irish have money to burn and they are building a bonfire: successive Christ mases have seen record retail sales and consumer debt is running at a record high.</p> <p>But success and wealth have not come free: within Ireland a debate has been rumbling about whether the country has lost its sense of identity, even its sense of humanity, in its fevered pursuit of riches. Some believe the country's proud greeting 'Cead Mile Failte' - a hundred thousand welcomes - is becoming an empty one.</p> <p>Critics of modern Ireland have much to latch on to. Racism is now an ugly reality in the Emerald Isle. News of Ireland's economic boom has spread far and wide, and thousands of asylum seekers arrive each year hoping to get a fresh start, bringing the Irish face to face with the prospect of a multicultural society. In 1992, a total of 80 people applied for asylum in Ireland. The rate now runs at 8,000 a month.</p> <p>It has not been a comfortable experience: rising reports of racial abuse on the streets have been matched by unexpected harshness and coldness in the official response to asylum seekers, which seems focused on ensuring that as few immigrants as possible actually succeed in setting foot on Irish soil.</p> <p>Even immigrants with valid visas and work permits have felt the chill of Irish hospitality: recently a group of workers from eastern Europe arrived with valid permits and the promise of jobs. When immigration officials discovered that those jobs no longer existed, the men were dispatched to Dublin's Mountjoy jail for three days.</p> <p>Wealth has also exacerbated a host of social problems.

      "bodyText": "Charlie McCreevy sank back into his comfortable seat and watched the bright early evening lights of the airport flicker past the cabin window of the Brussels-Dublin shuttle as it taxied to the runway for take-off. In a few moments he would be bound for home and, he reflected, a hero's welcome. It had been a gruelling day, but the Ireland's maverick Finance Minister knew the headlines in the country's press the next morning would be generous. McCreevy had been isolated and censured by his peers at last Monday's meeting of European Finance Ministers in Brussels, but he was not for turning. He had defiantly told his EU colleagues he would not abandon Ireland's hugely successful policies of low taxation and economic expansion. Furthermore, he told the disbelieving gathering, the rest of Europe would be better off copying Ireland's success, not criticising it. McCreevy had been summoned to Brussels to receive an unprecedented rebuke from his European partners for pursuing policies that they believe will overheat the already booming Irish economy. Europe's star pupil was being rapped across the knuckles. His defiance last week would have been unimaginable in an Irish Finance Minister 10 years ago, but after a decade of stunning economic growth, Ireland is a country changing at bewildering speed. Where once it tugged its forelock to Europe and held out the begging bowl for structural funds, now it struts with the brash self confidence of the nouveau riche. 'We have come of age,' said Jim O'Leary, chief economist of Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin. Ireland's economic performance has been almost matched by its cultural success. Irish musicians regularly dominate the British charts, from the old hands of U2, to Westlife and The Corrs and emerging stars like 18-year-old R and B singer Samantha Mumba. The country's writers, actors and playwrights have also enjoyed sustained success and international acclaim, while Irish designers such as Louise Kennedy and John Rocha have forced themselves to the forefront of the world fashion industry. Gone are the days of the Clancy Brothers, woolly jumpers and old men sipping pints of the black stuff in quaint old bars: modern Ireland presents itself as young, cool, affluent, self-confident and proud. It can even boast VIP, its very own celebrity magazine, modelled on Hello! and OK!, so that Ireland's new \u00e9lite can invite you into their homes and share their happiness with you. The irony that many of those featured have never been heard of sparks the odd snigger. Throughout the country wealth is ostentatious where once it was hidden away. New car sales have quadrupled, with each year's new licence plate (designated by the year, as in 01, and not by a letter), a 'must have' accessory. Last week in Dublin, top-of-the-range Mercedes jostled with brand new Jaguars on the city's gridlocked streets. House prices have soared by more than 70 per cent in seven years and dinner party conversations are reminiscent of London in the mid 1980s - money, money and more money. British cities such as Glasgow and Liverpool are now rich investment targets for Irish developers with money to spare. Jobs are also plentiful; technology companies advertising in the national press regularly offer salaries of up to IR\u00a3100,000. 'This place is awash with cash. People have developed the 'loadsamoney' culture that Britain experienced in the Eighties. Lunch is for wimps, greed is good and everybody wants a slice of the action,' wrote one commentator last month. The benefits of growth have been very real: emigration, the scourge of Ireland for generations, has been replaced by immigration as the booming economy creates more jobs than the Irish can fill. The Ryanair generation, once made up of the young Irish leaving in search of work, has now been replaced by a wave of tourists. Rural towns have been re-vitalised by commuters fleeing Dublin's high prices. Tumbling unemployment, low taxes and low interest rates have spread prosperity wider than ever before. For the first time in their history, the Irish have money to burn and they are building a bonfire: successive Christ mases have seen record retail sales and consumer debt is running at a record high. But success and wealth have not come free: within Ireland a debate has been rumbling about whether the country has lost its sense of identity, even its sense of humanity, in its fevered pursuit of riches. Some believe the country's proud greeting 'Cead Mile Failte' - a hundred thousand welcomes - is becoming an empty one. Critics of modern Ireland have much to latch on to. Racism is now an ugly reality in the Emerald Isle. News of Ireland's economic boom has spread far and wide, and thousands of asylum seekers arrive each year hoping to get a fresh start, bringing the Irish face to face with the prospect of a multicultural society. In 1992, a total of 80 people applied for asylum in Ireland. The rate now runs at 8,000 a month. It has not been a comfortable experience: rising reports of racial abuse on the streets have been matched by unexpected harshness and coldness in the official response to asylum seekers, which seems focused on ensuring that as few immigrants as possible actually succeed in setting foot on Irish soil. Even immigrants with valid visas and work permits have felt the chill of Irish hospitality: recently a group of workers from eastern Europe arrived with valid permits and the promise of jobs. When immigration officials discovered that those jobs no longer existed, the men were dispatched to Dublin's Mountjoy jail for three days. Wealth has also exacerbated a host of social problems. Last week the problem of teenage binge drinking knocked McCreevy off the front pages for a day: Irish teenagers are now the heaviest drinkers in Europe, but it is how they drink, rather than how much, which is causing concern. Irish teenagers, wealthier than ever because of parental handouts and weekend and holiday jobs, drink themselves into oblivion and the consequences can be shocking. Last year, national outrage was sparked when a Dublin teenager was kicked to death outside a nightclub after a row between two groups of boys - allegedly from rival fee-paying schools. Other manifestations of the boom have troubled observers. Irish theme bars, now littered across Britain, have replaced real Irish pubs, while super clubs, capable of hosting thousands of people, have mushroomed. In quiet country villages, typical of the fictional Ballykissangel, unsmiling doormen are becoming commonplace. Another big disappointment has been the failure of the government to invest some of the country's new found riches in an ageing and over-burdened health system that is in dire need of investment. The transport infrastructure is also creaking under the strain. 'There is no doubt that Ireland, in some ways, is a harsher society than it used to be, but I don't think that's irreversible,' said Walton Empey, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin. 'It's also a much more open society than it used to be and that is healthy.' The Irish economic miracle may have been primed by generous European structural funds in the late Eighties and early Nineties, but the real impetus for growth has been driven internally. Central to that growth has been a determination by successive Irish governments to cut taxes, both personal and corporate, and make Ireland the most attractive region in Europe for companies to move to. A determinedly consensual approach to economic planning that wrapped employers and unions into rolling wage agreements has helped. Low taxes and a young, well-educated and English speaking workforce (40 per cent of the Irish population is under-25) have enticed the high-technology titans such as Intel, Apple and Microsoft. The surge in employment has also created a labour shortage, with industry leaders predicting that Ireland will create more than 350,000 new jobs in the coming years and that about 200,000 of those will have to be filled by immigrants. Some will be Irish, lured by a government campaign to persuade Irish people abroad to come home. The influx can only accelerate the changes that have swept through Irish society in the past decade as it has moved from being a controlled, monocultural society to a freer multicultural one. Side by side with the economic explosion has been an equally dramatic upheaval in the perception of the church and of politics. A steady stream of sex abuse scandals throughout the Nineties stripped the Roman Catholic Church of its confidence and credibility. The effect on the morale of priests has been devastating and will take years to restore. Where once they were held in almost universal respect, now they come face to face with ridicule. 'I was on my way to the hospital when I met three young boys coming down the street towards me. \"Buggered any boys today, father?\" they shouted,' said one priest from a city parish. While the church was battered by crisis, Irish politics was also being dragged through the mud. A number of tribunals of inquiry investigating the beef industry, payments to politicians and the distribution of contaminated blood supplies have uncovered startling levels of corruption at the very top of Irish politics. Charles Haughey, the former Taoiseach, received millions of pounds from businessmen while in office and inexorably, other senior politicians are being drawn into the net as the tribunals continue their trawl. Last month Liam Lawlor, another Fianna Fail politician, was sent to jail for a week because he had not co-operated fully with a tribunal investigating payments to politicians.

The group were driving between villages in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in the south east. Another Briton, David Weston, and the group's Bangladeshi driver were also abducted but later released unharmed, spokesman Jon Geddes said. The unidentified gunmen have demanded a \u00a31.2m ransom, he said. The Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the situation and we are in contact with the Bangladesh authorities and are providing consular assistance.' Watch out for the weevils The weevil Ixaion variegatum, a type which feeds on mistletoe and was until now found only on the Continent, has been discovered in England, in an orchard in a National Trust estate at Brockhampton, Herefordshire. Sign of times Vandals caused traffic chaos in Totland, Isle of Wight, after they left eight road signs pointing the wrong way. Boy dies in fire Police are regarding as suspicious the death of a boy aged 15 months in a fire at a house in Newport, South Wales. The toddler was rescued along with his mother and his brother aged nine but died in hospital. Lawrence's Pillars of Wisdom is auctioned for \u00a318,000 A 1926 subscription edition of T.E. Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom , one of only 120 copies produced and which was owned by the late Naomi Mitchison, fetched \u00a318,000. Lyon &amp; Turnbull said the hammer was about to come down when an offer was received from a buyer in the South of England who had heard of the sale only that morning. 'The man rang the saleroom just at the moment that the book was being sold,' said spokesman Phillip Gregory. 'The person who took his call ran to the auction room to place his bid as the hammer was coming down.' The book, which was lavishly illustrated by Augustus John and other artists, recounts Lawrence's experiences during the Arab Revolt in 1916 and was the inspiration for Lawrence of Arabia , directed by David Lean. Millennium stained glass window in medieval church would look wrong, judge told A stained glass window to celebrate the millennium would be out of place in a medieval church, Mr Justice Gage was told by the Council for the Care of Churches in a special ecclesiastical court hearing. Parishioners thought the window at All Saints in Broughton, Cambridgeshire, costing \u00a38,000 and depicting St Christopher carrying the infant Jesus, was an ideal way to mark 2,000 years of Christianity. Parish council chairman John Ray said: 'Each generation has left its mark.' The court suspended judgment. Detective constable charged with intent to supply drugs A CID detective constable has been arrested in Norbury, south London, with three other men on suspicion of drug offences, including possession of class B drugs with intent to supply.

No reason was given except that they were journalists. Immigration officials said other foreign journalists would also be kicked out of the country, but they did not give details. Late yesterday, Zimbabwe's Information Minister Jonathan Moyo claimed that Winter's work permit was invalid because, he alleged, he had bribed an official to forge a letter on his behalf. Winter denies the allegation and those who know him dismiss the charge as absurd. Sayagues was on business in South Africa and returned to Harare yesterday. Immigration officials initially refused to let her enter Zimbabwe but she pleaded to be allowed to be reunited with her nine-year-old daughter and so was given 24 hours to quit the country. 'As a journalist I have been reporting on human rights abuses and the general breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe,' said a defiant Sayagues. 'The action taken against me is small compared to those Zimbabweans who have been murdered, tortured and beaten.' Supporters of the Mugabe government have already beaten and threatened Zimbabwean journalists and earlier this month the printing press of the independent Daily News was destroyed in a massive bomb blast. The explosion came just hours after Moyo said the Daily News was a threat to national security and must be stopped. In the past week the government has threatened Supreme Court judges, arrested opposition politicians on spurious charges and sent troops into Harare's townships to beat residents at random. Confronted by widespread unpopularity and a rapidly declining economy, Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party are attacking all critics. By threatening judges and encouraging them to resign, the Mugabe government has carried out what lawyers call 'a coup against the judiciary'. Three hundred of Mugabe's war veterans invaded the Supreme Court and forced the five judges to flee. The judges have received death threats and been excoriated in the state press by Mugabe and ministers. Supreme Court Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay succumbed to the pressure and resigned. But the other Supreme Court judges are making a stand against the government. Justice Nick McNally refused to accept early retirement. Justices Wilson Sandura and Simbarashe Muchechetere refused to meet with Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa. Zimbabwe's Supreme Court has been admirably independent and in December issued carefully considered reversals to Mugabe's 'fast track' land seizures, ordering police to remove thousands of Mugabe's supporters from lands they were occupying illegally. In January the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional Mugabe's amendment to the Electoral Act which stated that no legal challenge could be made to the results of parliamentary elections. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is pressing court cases against the results of 40 parliamentary seats with strong evidence of state-sponsored violence, intimidation and fraud. The MDC's president, Morgan Tsvangirai, was on Thursday charged with inciting violence against the president, along with four MDC members of parliament. In September Tsvangirai said, 'We call on Mugabe to resign peacefully or he will risk being overthrown violently.' They all deny the charges. Related story 'I've been caught up in a hurricane'",

There were a few cars speeding on the empty roads, the caf\u00e9s by the banks of the River Tigris were full but, on the whole, the city was quiet.</p> <p>In fact, the sirens, and the streams of flaring tracer that the Iraqi air defences spat into the air, were too late. The 24 planes sent by Britain and the United States to teach Saddam Hussein yet another lesson were already screaming back to their bases in Saudi Arabia or lining up to land on the USS Harry S.Truman bobbing in the Gulf. Using high-tech 'stand-off' missiles the warplanes had not needed to approach the city to unleash their attack. Their missiles slammed into five command and control centres used, claim Washington and London, to co-ordinate Iraq's air defences.</p> <p>The sky flaring against the black silhouettes of Baghdad's palm trees served as a giant noticeboard for America's new president. The message, to Saddam, to the Middle East, to the world, was plain to see.</p> <p>But for the people of Baghdad the message is an old one. As the dull thump of the explosions shook the city, small crowds gathered in the streets. The impact of the strikes was discussed and analysed. Then, with the night growing chill, the groups broke up and went home to bed.</p> <p>Washington and London has been predictably upbeat. Unmanned spotter planes sent up in the wake of the attack revealed that 'all weapons hit their targets successfully', the Ministry of Defence in London said.</p> <p>Baghdad said two people were killed and 11, including several children, were injured. London briefed that they were more likely to have been hit by falling anti-aircraft ordnance than anything else. At first glance the damage, on both sides, seemed relatively slight.</p> <p>But yesterday, as worldwide reaction to the strikes proved almost unanimously negative and there were demonstrations against America and in support of Saddam across the Arab world, the real impact of the strikes looked ominous.</p> <p>In the last 36 hours Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook have rammed home the justification for the attacks in interviews.</p> <p>The strikes were necessary to eliminate a threat to the planes patrolling the 'no-fly zones' in the north and south of Iraq, they said. The zones were imposed after the 1991 war to protect the Shi'ite Muslims and Marsh Arabs in the south, and the Kurds in the north, from repression by Saddam. The dictator has a history of appalling violence against both groups. When they rebelled against Baghdad after the Gulf War, having been promised support from the Americans, they were brutally crushed. The no-fly zones, which do not have a UN mandate, were imposed to help them.</p> <p>Thus Hoon's oft-repeated claim that Friday's strikes were 'humanitarian'.</p> <p>In the last 10 years US and UK planes have flown tens of thousands of sorties over Iraq. Their rules of engagement state that when they are 'locked on to' by anti-aircraft (AA) missiles, of which the Iraqis still have many, they can fight back. Though there has been significant degradation of Baghdad's AA defences, there has been 'collateral damage' as well. It is thought that more than 140 civilians have been killed by British and US missiles and hundreds more injured. Earlier this year, a missile hit a veterinarian clinic and killed, the Iraqis claimed, six people. Previous errors have included a sheep dip targeted after it was mistaken for a surface-to-air missile launch site.</p> <p>The fault is not entirely with the pilots. The Iraqis routinely conceal their military hardware among civilians. Shortly after the last set of raids The Observer saw guns concealed in a university.</p> <p>The plans for Friday's attack originated with officers in the US Central Command who patrol the no-fly zone. For them, Bush's election was welcome.</p> <p>The past six months has seen intensified Iraqi activity. By one analysis, Saddam's forces have fired more missiles in the last year than in the previous nine. The missiles were also coming closer, with pilots reporting an increasing number of 'trips' - near-misses from AA missiles felt by those in the cockpit.</p> <p>Intelligence revealed that the Iraqis had recently linked their missile batteries with fibre-optic cables greatly increasing their efficiency.</p> <p>But the political tide seemed to be flowing in a different direction. Instead of escalation, Clinton's preferred tactic had been to scale back the patrols to avoid clashes.</p> <p>But since Bush's inauguration on 20 January, the attacks on Iraqi anti-aircraft targets have been ramped up again. There had been nine attacks on Iraqi anti-aircraft targets south of the 33rd parallel, which had not needed presidential approval, before Friday's strike.</p> <p>The recommendation to strike at the five command and communications centres above the 33rd parallel - the limit of the no-fly zones - originated with the commanders in the Gulf at the beginning of the week.</p> <p>By Tuesday night, the Pentagon top strata were briefing the new Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, who then spoke to Vice-President Dick Cheney by telephone.</p> <p>Cheney asked Bush about the strike during a meeting on Wednesday morning, and continued to talk with his friend and colleague Rumsfeld during the rest of the day.</p> <p>Early on Thursday , Cheney received a second lengthy briefing during the drive from his suburban Virginia home into Washington.</p> <p>That morning, the full facts and recommendations were laid out before the President. Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice all discussed the proposals. The President retired for 20 minutes, and then gave his assent to the strike.</p> <p>As Bush stepped off Air Force One at the airport in Le\u00f3n, Mexico, for his first foreign trip at 9am on Friday, he knew the jets were fuelling up and ready to go.</p> <p>Throughout his election campaign, Bush had sent out strong signals that he regarded the Clinton administration's policy towards Iraq as bankrupt.</p> <p>'The strongest impression I have of Bush,' said Thomas Mann, analyst with the Brookings Institution, 'is that what he says before the election is very relevant to what he does after it.'</p> <p>Significantly, Bush made no changes to his agenda and even sought to play down the attack on Iraq during his fleeting trip to Mexico. He stuck rigidly to the programme he had agreed with Mexican President Vicente Fox. It sent another clear signal. Concerned though he might be to tackle Saddam - and by implication the problems in distant parts - his priority was still closer to home: relations across the Americas.</p> <p>Quite when the British became involved in the planning of the strikes is unclear. A Foreign Office source said yesterday that because British pilots fly alongside their American counterparts senior UK officers were on board from the start. But analysts say that London probably learnt of US intentions after Cheney's Thursday morning briefing.</p> <p>Though Cook visited Washington last week and discussed Iraq at length with Powell, it is not thought that the plan was then on the table. Powell has spoken of his desire to 're-energise' the crumbling and deeply unpopular sanctions regime against Iraq and, sources say, much of the discussion between the two men centred on ways to bring global opinion round behind the UN embargo.</p> <p>Powell clearly understood that, notwithstanding the ideological differences between Tony Blair and Bush, the commitment to a hard line on Iraq was unshaken. Cook is unlikely to have thought that his word would be tested quite so soon.</p> <p>Hoon was contacted by the Americans on Thursday night. He spoke to the Prime Minister and consultations with the Americans and British defence staff continued through the night. By mid-afternoon in the UK, the planes were heading for their targets.</p> <p>Next week Blair will visit Washington. The trip is designed to publicly announce that the 'special relationship' across the Atlantic is still very much alive.</p> <p>This weekend Bush will be glad of it. Although the Americans could easily do without the British military input, London's involvment provides critical diplomatic support. Other than the UK, and Israel, even allies like Turkey - from whose airbases the jets that patrol the northern no-fly zone take off - have been critical of Friday's attacks. The continued threat of Saddam's non-conventional weapons programme or territorial ambitions is no longer enough to scare states into supporting Washington. The days of the Gulf War coalition are long gone.</p> <p>Within Iraq, strikes only make Saddam stronger. There is now almost a generation of young people who have grown up with war. Many young adults can hardly remember the days when Britain and America were seen as friends of the Iraqi people. There is even, among older Iraqis, a residual respect for the British. But in the schools the children are taught a doctrine of hate. And every strike plays into Saddam's hands.</p> <p>'We tell our pupils the truth,' one teacher in a Baghdad school told The Observer last month. 'We tell them that the British and the Americans are together in a Zionist-run plot to destroy our president because he is a leader of the Arab and Muslim people. And all the attacks are evidence of that truth.'</p> <p>Given their own ruler's vicious nature, most Iraqis believe that the people of Britain do not share their leaders' hawkish views. But that may change. Saddam has embarked on a deliberate 'Islamisation' campaign aimed at boosting his credentials as a Muslim leader and radicalising youth. His calls for 'jihad' against Israel have increasing resonance both inside Iraq and in the region.</p> <p>And his grasp on power seems as tight as ever. His hated intelligence services still operate with horrific efficiency. Mass executions have recently purged prisons. There have been a series of 'ethnic cleansing' operations to clear out potentially dissident Kurds and other minorities from several central cities.</p> <p>'There won't be a coup,' one Iraqi dissident living in London said yesterday. 'Because you need at least two people for a coup. And in Iraq now one will always betray the other before he's betrayed himself.'</p> <p>The new American administration has made it clear that it regards the Iraqi opposition - all, of course, in exile - as their best hope to depose Iraq.</p> <p>But few analysts rate the chances of Washington's prefered successors very highly. In the last decade they have received millions of dollars in aid and achieved virtually nothing. The lavish headquarters they have maintained in London has been a focus of controversy and their recent plan, backed by the Clinton administration, for a leafletting campaign in the north of the country, was seen as risible.

He is now an extraordinarily rich man with a private fortune estimated at \u00a34 billion, largely derived from oil smuggling. His power within Iraq is bolstered by a new stratum of rich middle-class businessmen, many of whom have made their money exploiting the sanctions regime.

      "body": "<p>It was when Tracey Tait waved to me to say she had not changed her mind - and yes she would still be voting in favour of the euro - that I first dared to hope that we could do better than achieving a pro-euro swing. We might even win the mini referendum.</p> <p>I had been asked in November by the BBC to be team leader for the pro-euro case in a mini referendum campaign to be undertaken over a week-end in a street whose opinions and socio-economic characteristics more or less matched those of the country where support is consistently two to one against the euro.</p> <p>We would canvass and leaflet just as in a national referendum. I had insisted that we construct a team that was evenly composed of men and women and as young as possible; as the pro-euro side is funkier, younger and more open than the antis, I thought we should try to look that way - although with me in the team we already had a serious deficiency in the age and looks department.</p> <p>People were listening. They were hungry for information, especially the young - and even more especially young women. What was more extraordinary they were coming over to us because they didn't like the xenophobic cloud of union jackery and reverence to the ageing gods of Britishness from the antis that just hours earlier had seemed like an insuperable block to our case. I had underestimated the British.</p> <p>It was one of our earlier converts - Andrew Dewsall - who put it best. Going in to the euro made more economic sense than staying out. As for Britishness, he didn't want to be part of a culture that defined his identity as putting on Union Jack boxer trunks on the beach in Corfu, harping on about the war and regarding the European Union as a foreign plot.</p> <p>Austin Mitchell had just canvassed him wearing his Union Jack tie; the antis can't see it, but it is precisely because people's patriotism runs deep that they recoil from tasteless stage props such as Union Jack ties. Their patriotism is much more quiet, discrete and anchored.</p> <p>In the event it was a 23 per cent swing; 58 per cent of Referendum Street voting for the euro and only 42 per cent against. The opposition to the euro might be extensive, but it's shallow.</p> <p>But it didn't feel that way when we started last Saturday morning. Lembit Opik, the LibDem MP, was paired with Marcelle D'Argy Smith, the former editor of Cosmopolitan. Tony Banks would join us on Sunday to canvass with Sara Priem of the Young European Movement. And I paired up with Julia Gash, a thirtysomething lingerie designer whose business has been decimated by the high pound.</p> <p>We sallied forth down Referendum Street - a street off Southgate high street in North London - to meet our first voter. The six antis were led by David Mellor and included the Daily Mail's Simon Heffer and a self-consciously political Tory MEP, Teresa Villiers. With Labour's Mitchell they were cross-party, and we thought (wrongly) that their Britain-should-not-give-up-what-works-for-an-eurofudge-and-lose-sovereignty line would play pretty well.</p> <p>Julia and I found our first five or six encounters pretty depressing. Our argument was that the euro was good for manufacturing jobs, interest rates and investment; moreover it would strike a blow against rip-off Britain by promoting genuine price comparisons with mainland Europe.</p> <p>Julia's own business experiences, increasingly having to invoice in euros, personally accepting an exchange rate risk even while her goods were being priced out of overseas markets, were pretty sobering. We said that although we could see it was a risk going in, staying out was also a risk. We accepted that sometimes one interest rate would not be suitable for every country, but that the gains for Britain and Europe as a whole would more than compensate for individual country's problems.</p> <p>As for the sovereignty the sceptics said we were losing, it was illusory; Britain had no more control over the exchange rate in today's world of vast capital movements than Canute had over the tide. The choice was whether we wanted faceless foreign exchange speculators setting the value of the pound or the stability of the European Central Bank. Europe is no more than a club in which like-minded countries in a similar position get together to achieve common ends that can't be achieved alone - like having a stable currency and consistently low interest rates.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, I think these arguments - on balance - make the case for entry pretty overwhelming. But try them on a working-class couple like Rosalind and John Wheeler and you quickly get disabused. He's a Tottenham supporter, a Daily Mail reader and a warehouseman. For all the complaint about lack of debate etc. the Wheelers were really clued up, and they fired back replies for our every point.</p> <p>I tried telling him that if Tottenham were successfully to compete in European football competitions it wouldn't make the club any less English, and the FA didn't think it was losing sovereignty by being part of UEFA - and for the first time his sceptic flow was checked. Not for long though; like others we canvassed earlier he was engulfed in suspicion of all things foreign. 1945 lives on.</p> <p>Then we hit gold; Tracey Tait and Victoria Knight, two highly intelligent young working-class women, were soft antis - but they carried none of the baggage about the Union Jack, the war and even Elgar. They wanted information. Like a lot of those we canvassed, they felt they had never heard the pro argument. Within 15 minutes they had come over to us. It was common sense, they said.</p> <p>Seeing people respond to your argument is a great feeling - and I saw the buzz that politicians must get. But it was when someone in the lunchtime crowd shouted at a heckler that it was time to put the war behind us, that I first began to feel opinion really changing. The roots of too much euroscepticism is sheer nastiness - and British tolerance runs deeper still.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the vote a lot of blame was heaped on the hapless Mellor, and it is true that one of the reasons the sceptics lost is that they were not as personable as the pros. But this will reproduce itself in a real referendum; scepticism is a darker credo than the sunnier worldview of the pros - and this comes through in the style, culture and personality-type attracted to the twin camps.</p> <p>Yes is more open than No. What was also impressive was the way young people would listen, and the way they soaked up information. And while the British are profoundly patriotic, they are not nationalist in the simple fashion portrayed by the sceptics. An electorate this small is hardly representative, but the result is an important pointer. With leadership and conviction the pros could win a referendum. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown please note.</p> <p><b>Related story</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,439386,00.html\">How to make sense of the euro debate</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was when Tracey Tait waved to me to say she had not changed her mind - and yes she would still be voting in favour of the euro - that I first dared to hope that we could do better than achieving a pro-euro swing. We might even win the mini referendum. I had been asked in November by the BBC to be team leader for the pro-euro case in a mini referendum campaign to be undertaken over a week-end in a street whose opinions and socio-economic characteristics more or less matched those of the country where support is consistently two to one against the euro. We would canvass and leaflet just as in a national referendum. I had insisted that we construct a team that was evenly composed of men and women and as young as possible; as the pro-euro side is funkier, younger and more open than the antis, I thought we should try to look that way - although with me in the team we already had a serious deficiency in the age and looks department. People were listening. They were hungry for information, especially the young - and even more especially young women. What was more extraordinary they were coming over to us because they didn't like the xenophobic cloud of union jackery and reverence to the ageing gods of Britishness from the antis that just hours earlier had seemed like an insuperable block to our case. I had underestimated the British. It was one of our earlier converts - Andrew Dewsall - who put it best. Going in to the euro made more economic sense than staying out. As for Britishness, he didn't want to be part of a culture that defined his identity as putting on Union Jack boxer trunks on the beach in Corfu, harping on about the war and regarding the European Union as a foreign plot. Austin Mitchell had just canvassed him wearing his Union Jack tie; the antis can't see it, but it is precisely because people's patriotism runs deep that they recoil from tasteless stage props such as Union Jack ties. Their patriotism is much more quiet, discrete and anchored. In the event it was a 23 per cent swing; 58 per cent of Referendum Street voting for the euro and only 42 per cent against. The opposition to the euro might be extensive, but it's shallow. But it didn't feel that way when we started last Saturday morning. Lembit Opik, the LibDem MP, was paired with Marcelle D'Argy Smith, the former editor of Cosmopolitan. Tony Banks would join us on Sunday to canvass with Sara Priem of the Young European Movement. And I paired up with Julia Gash, a thirtysomething lingerie designer whose business has been decimated by the high pound. We sallied forth down Referendum Street - a street off Southgate high street in North London - to meet our first voter. The six antis were led by David Mellor and included the Daily Mail's Simon Heffer and a self-consciously political Tory MEP, Teresa Villiers. With Labour's Mitchell they were cross-party, and we thought (wrongly) that their Britain-should-not-give-up-what-works-for-an-eurofudge-and-lose-sovereignty line would play pretty well. Julia and I found our first five or six encounters pretty depressing. Our argument was that the euro was good for manufacturing jobs, interest rates and investment; moreover it would strike a blow against rip-off Britain by promoting genuine price comparisons with mainland Europe. Julia's own business experiences, increasingly having to invoice in euros, personally accepting an exchange rate risk even while her goods were being priced out of overseas markets, were pretty sobering. We said that although we could see it was a risk going in, staying out was also a risk. We accepted that sometimes one interest rate would not be suitable for every country, but that the gains for Britain and Europe as a whole would more than compensate for individual country's problems. As for the sovereignty the sceptics said we were losing, it was illusory; Britain had no more control over the exchange rate in today's world of vast capital movements than Canute had over the tide. The choice was whether we wanted faceless foreign exchange speculators setting the value of the pound or the stability of the European Central Bank. Europe is no more than a club in which like-minded countries in a similar position get together to achieve common ends that can't be achieved alone - like having a stable currency and consistently low interest rates. Unsurprisingly, I think these arguments - on balance - make the case for entry pretty overwhelming. But try them on a working-class couple like Rosalind and John Wheeler and you quickly get disabused. He's a Tottenham supporter, a Daily Mail reader and a warehouseman. For all the complaint about lack of debate etc. the Wheelers were really clued up, and they fired back replies for our every point. I tried telling him that if Tottenham were successfully to compete in European football competitions it wouldn't make the club any less English, and the FA didn't think it was losing sovereignty by being part of UEFA - and for the first time his sceptic flow was checked. Not for long though; like others we canvassed earlier he was engulfed in suspicion of all things foreign. 1945 lives on. Then we hit gold; Tracey Tait and Victoria Knight, two highly intelligent young working-class women, were soft antis - but they carried none of the baggage about the Union Jack, the war and even Elgar. They wanted information. Like a lot of those we canvassed, they felt they had never heard the pro argument. Within 15 minutes they had come over to us. It was common sense, they said. Seeing people respond to your argument is a great feeling - and I saw the buzz that politicians must get. But it was when someone in the lunchtime crowd shouted at a heckler that it was time to put the war behind us, that I first began to feel opinion really changing. The roots of too much euroscepticism is sheer nastiness - and British tolerance runs deeper still. In the aftermath of the vote a lot of blame was heaped on the hapless Mellor, and it is true that one of the reasons the sceptics lost is that they were not as personable as the pros. But this will reproduce itself in a real referendum; scepticism is a darker credo than the sunnier worldview of the pros - and this comes through in the style, culture and personality-type attracted to the twin camps. Yes is more open than No. What was also impressive was the way young people would listen, and the way they soaked up information. And while the British are profoundly patriotic, they are not nationalist in the simple fashion portrayed by the sceptics. An electorate this small is hardly representative, but the result is an important pointer. With leadership and conviction the pros could win a referendum. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown please note.

But it is hard not to ponder portents considering what has happened to Spurs since encountering their favourite number. Now that the season has turned into 01 they have been unbeaten, have finally discovered how to win on their travels, and have fortune on their side. They do in the FA Cup anyway, given their unexpected recovery from a 2-0 deficit at Charlton in the last round, before enjoying the luck of the draw with a home tie against lower League opponents hit by an outbreak of flu. As a route into the last eight, this proved the easiest of passages. </p> <p>So, there is plenty for Tottenham to cheer. Graham's men are playing with bountiful confidence, and the progress being made by a clutch of youngsters is particularly promising. While Gary Doherty and Ledley King are virtually established in the first team, yesterday the home crowd witnessed the coming of age of another stylish performer. Simon Davies crowned a composed performance with two outstanding goals. </p> <p>The biggest upset was the fact that Tottenham had allowed access to a man from the Daily Mail . </p> <p>The gulf in class told early - \u00a311 million international Sergei Rebrov took on the 17-year-old County defender Rob Clare en route to the box. No contest. The consequent free-kick was floated in by Stephen Clemence and King applied the gentlest of glances to squeeze home the opening goal. </p> <p>Did Stockport have a chance of getting backat Tottenham? The less savoury method was evident in Mike Flynn's violent dig at Oyvind Leonhardsen's shin (the Norwegian was soon forced to limp off).

      "bodyText": "although the chant of 'Spurs are on the their way to Cardiff' had an unfamiliar ring to it, anyone with the slightest inkling about Tottenham's FA Cup history realises exactly why they cannot help singing new versions of old Wembley final favourites at White Hart Lane. George Graham may not be a man who believes in omens. But it is hard not to ponder portents considering what has happened to Spurs since encountering their favourite number. Now that the season has turned into 01 they have been unbeaten, have finally discovered how to win on their travels, and have fortune on their side. They do in the FA Cup anyway, given their unexpected recovery from a 2-0 deficit at Charlton in the last round, before enjoying the luck of the draw with a home tie against lower League opponents hit by an outbreak of flu. As a route into the last eight, this proved the easiest of passages. So, there is plenty for Tottenham to cheer. Graham's men are playing with bountiful confidence, and the progress being made by a clutch of youngsters is particularly promising. While Gary Doherty and Ledley King are virtually established in the first team, yesterday the home crowd witnessed the coming of age of another stylish performer. Simon Davies crowned a composed performance with two outstanding goals. The biggest upset was the fact that Tottenham had allowed access to a man from the Daily Mail . The gulf in class told early - \u00a311 million international Sergei Rebrov took on the 17-year-old County defender Rob Clare en route to the box. No contest. The consequent free-kick was floated in by Stephen Clemence and King applied the gentlest of glances to squeeze home the opening goal. Did Stockport have a chance of getting backat Tottenham? The less savoury method was evident in Mike Flynn's violent dig at Oyvind Leonhardsen's shin (the Norwegian was soon forced to limp off). Otherwise, they managed a reasonable amount of possession and showed plenty of endeavour. They posed a threat in the air, but Tottenham possessed enough know-how to cope. The contest was all but over by the half-hour mark when Rebrov scooped the ball towards Les Ferdinand, whose headed lob was finished with a flourish by the substitute Davies. The 21-year-old signed from Peterborough outmanoeuvred two defenders and created space for himself with a shrewd flick of the head, before driving low and and hard past Lee Jones. County almost gave themselves a lifeline when Shefki Kuqi diverted a corner a fraction over the crossbar, but Stockport hopes were dashed once and for all a minute before half-time. Rebrov fed Luke Young down the right flank, whose whipped-in cross was prodded home by the only man lurking in the six-yard box: County captain Flynn, he of the horror tackle on Leonhardsen. From hereon in it was merely a case of how much Tottenham wanted to enjoy their stroll into the quarter-finals. Davies took his second goal with aplomb, latching on to Tim Sherwood's lofted pass before finding the bottom corner with a sweet strike. Stockport displayed sufficient battling qualities to keep the score respectable and their corner of supporters in good spirits. But it was the Tottenham masses who went home happiest. There is, though, clearly more work to be done and lucky draws to be had. After all, Tottenham have never won anything when the year begins in two.",

Wimbledon used to thrive on their reputation as party-poopers when they were regularly bloodying noses at football's top table, but it hardly suits them to be the team to end Wycombe's cup hopes. Lawrie Sanchez, who gave Wimbledon their greatest moment when he scored the winner in the 1988 FA Cup final against Liverpool, has fashioned a decent side at Wycombe who proved their cup pedigree with victories over Grimsby and Wolves in previous rounds. But Terry Burton's Wimbledon are starting to look more formidable now that key players such as Kenny Cunningham and Gareth Ainsworth have returned from long-term injuries. Cunningham's experience in a relatively young side cannot be underestimated, and they have not lost since he returned from a nine-month lay-off four games ago.

It was no more than the Dons deserved for their domination, although their goalkeeper, Kelvin Davis, made a superb save moments before Agyemang's goal to keep out a crisp half-volley from Wycombe's Dave Carroll. But the cup is nothing if not unpredictable, and just as Wimbledon appeared to be cruising into the quarter-finals, Wycombe sprang a surprise. Sam Parkin, the young forward on loan from Chelsea, was introduced as a second-half substitute and was instrumental in Wycombe's goal in the 72nd minute. The burly striker, chasing what appeared a lost cause, forced a Dons defender into an error, and as the visitors failed to clear their lines, Michael Simpson fired in a low shot that took a deflection before going into the net off the inside of the far post.

It should have been an ideal start, but the weight on Dailly's pass meant Kanout\u00e9 did not need to take a touch until he was bearing down on the goalkeeper, and - when he did - he succeeded only in nudging the ball tamely into Thomas Sorensen's arms. </p> <p>Michael Carrick worked the same move five minutes later, for Kanout\u00e9 this time to shoot narrowly wide.

Niall Quinn rarely got the better of Igor Stimac and Kevin Phillips struggled to get a look-in, with the result that Shaka Hislop only had a single save to make in the first half. John Oster did well to create space for a shooting opportunity, but his eventual effort did not cause Hislop any problems. </p> <p>Kanout\u00e9 ended the half forcing a save from Sorensen, but when Di Canio opened the second by pinching a chance from Joe Cole's toes and firing wastefully into the side-netting, it began to look as if the Hammers might end up regretting their profligacy. With a midfield depleted by suspensions to Alex Rae and Don Hutchison, however, Sunderland were powerless to prevent their opponents coming through the centre. Nigel Winterburn split their defence again in the 71st minute for Frank Lampard to waste another chance by shooting straight at the goalkeeper, but it was only a matter of time before West Ham got their act together, and it was Lampard himself who made amends. </p> <p>Running through the centre from his own half, Lampard waited until he was at Kanout\u00e9's shoulder before releasing his pass, ensuring the linesman's flag stayed down. Kanout\u00e9 ran past Emerson Thome and, assisted by Sorensen's reckless sprint out of his area, slipped the ball coolly past the keeper. </p> <p>Sunderland could hardly complain. They failed to extend Hislop until the closing seconds, although the West Ham goalkeeper was well protected by the outstanding Stuart Pearce, now 38. He cleared bravely under his own bar from Phillips, after Quinn had done well to get a cross in, and threw himself at Oster to block a goalbound shot. </p> <p>Redknapp said.

      "byline": "Paul Wilson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>ITV, who mostly make do with former England managers, must have been a bit miffed, though of course had they booked Eriksson they would still have had to fit him in around the adverts. </p> <p>The novelty of having a foreign England coach has not yet worn off, even one who has nothing very much to say but is capable of being noncommittal in a disarmingly courteous manner. Eriksson has been paraded around like a prize exhibit this past month or so, but probably to his relief the phoney war ends on Friday when he names his first squad. </p> <p>England play Spain in a friendly at Villa Park on Wednesday week, and, although the occasion might not be the most competitive event in the football calendar, an unusual combination of circumstances has lent the game a significance all of its own. Eriksson will be the fourth manager England have played under in their past four matches, Howard Wilkinson and Peter Taylor having supervised the trips to Finland and Italy since the fateful day in October when the Germans consigned Wembley and Kevin Keegan to history. </p> <p>Wilkinson stuck with Keegan's team in Helsinki, Taylor picked a completely different one for the one-off friendly in Turin, so despite England being in the middle of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup it feels as though they have been treading water. Tony Adams took the opportunity to announce his retirement, further destroying any template Eriksson might have been hoping to use, though continuity of a sort was established with the news that Darren Anderton is injured again. The new man will soon get used to that. </p> <p>Of course, if continuity was what England wanted they would never have gone to Italy looking for a coach. Eriksson's whole brief is to depart from the usual script, and although his first squad will be a list of familiar names, more importantly it will be regarded as a virtual audit of the country's available talent. </p> <p>It is an almost unique situation, after all. Foreign man agers usually work in developing countries with a well-defined international elite. They do not normally get the chance to follow teams around Europe in the later stages of the Champions League, or consider possibilities theoretically suggested by 92 professional clubs. </p> <p>The choices open to Eriksson must have seemed bewildering at times, but like any incoming manager he simply has to sort out what to change and what to leave alone. With maximum points now necessary from the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March, he has little scope for experiment and has promised to name the strongest squad he can, featuring perhaps as many as 25 names. </p> <p>What is left of it after the Worthington Cup final and FA Cup replays have taken their toll remains to be seen, but at least Manchester United are not doing anything that week. David Beck ham, Paul Scholes, Wes Brown, Gary Neville and possibly Teddy Sheringham can all expect to be involved, as they provide a solid bank of experience as well as ability. Eriksson has been unlucky so far in his attempts to watch Steven Gerrard, but it will be odd if the Liverpool midfielder is not included, along with all three of the club's English strikers. These are not startlingly new choices, but it is unrealistic to expect Eriksson to change too much before a ball has been kicked. </p> <p>Surprises? Joe Cole hardly counts, but Arsenal's Ashley Cole could also get a look in. Eriksson and Tord Grip managed to convey their enthusiasm for the full-back even when Silvinho was keeping him out of the side. Ditto Paul Robinson, who could make the squad despite losing his Leeds place to Nigel Martyn. Most worried man might be David Seaman, who has rarely been seen at his best since Eriksson arrived in England. </p> <p>And the shock? Rio Ferdinand might not be required as a sweeper.</p>",

      "bodyText": "ITV, who mostly make do with former England managers, must have been a bit miffed, though of course had they booked Eriksson they would still have had to fit him in around the adverts. The novelty of having a foreign England coach has not yet worn off, even one who has nothing very much to say but is capable of being noncommittal in a disarmingly courteous manner. Eriksson has been paraded around like a prize exhibit this past month or so, but probably to his relief the phoney war ends on Friday when he names his first squad. England play Spain in a friendly at Villa Park on Wednesday week, and, although the occasion might not be the most competitive event in the football calendar, an unusual combination of circumstances has lent the game a significance all of its own. Eriksson will be the fourth manager England have played under in their past four matches, Howard Wilkinson and Peter Taylor having supervised the trips to Finland and Italy since the fateful day in October when the Germans consigned Wembley and Kevin Keegan to history. Wilkinson stuck with Keegan's team in Helsinki, Taylor picked a completely different one for the one-off friendly in Turin, so despite England being in the middle of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup it feels as though they have been treading water. Tony Adams took the opportunity to announce his retirement, further destroying any template Eriksson might have been hoping to use, though continuity of a sort was established with the news that Darren Anderton is injured again. The new man will soon get used to that. Of course, if continuity was what England wanted they would never have gone to Italy looking for a coach. Eriksson's whole brief is to depart from the usual script, and although his first squad will be a list of familiar names, more importantly it will be regarded as a virtual audit of the country's available talent. It is an almost unique situation, after all. Foreign man agers usually work in developing countries with a well-defined international elite. They do not normally get the chance to follow teams around Europe in the later stages of the Champions League, or consider possibilities theoretically suggested by 92 professional clubs. The choices open to Eriksson must have seemed bewildering at times, but like any incoming manager he simply has to sort out what to change and what to leave alone. With maximum points now necessary from the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March, he has little scope for experiment and has promised to name the strongest squad he can, featuring perhaps as many as 25 names. What is left of it after the Worthington Cup final and FA Cup replays have taken their toll remains to be seen, but at least Manchester United are not doing anything that week. David Beck ham, Paul Scholes, Wes Brown, Gary Neville and possibly Teddy Sheringham can all expect to be involved, as they provide a solid bank of experience as well as ability. Eriksson has been unlucky so far in his attempts to watch Steven Gerrard, but it will be odd if the Liverpool midfielder is not included, along with all three of the club's English strikers. These are not startlingly new choices, but it is unrealistic to expect Eriksson to change too much before a ball has been kicked. Surprises? Joe Cole hardly counts, but Arsenal's Ashley Cole could also get a look in. Eriksson and Tord Grip managed to convey their enthusiasm for the full-back even when Silvinho was keeping him out of the side. Ditto Paul Robinson, who could make the squad despite losing his Leeds place to Nigel Martyn. Most worried man might be David Seaman, who has rarely been seen at his best since Eriksson arrived in England. And the shock? Rio Ferdinand might not be required as a sweeper.",

Few would argue that Arsenal have been United's only serious challengers over the past five years or so. But the way Liverpool brushed them aside at Anfield - shortly before they beat us 5-0 in the same stadium - hinted at the arrogance of old. I'd say that they are the best side Liverpool have had for nine or 10 years - a view reinforced by one of my coaches, Ray Houghton, a key player in the last great Liverpool side of the late Eighties.</p> <p>The changes in that time have been enormous. Ray says that there was no rocket science applied to their coaching a lot of five-a-sides and ballwork, but the fundamental principle was to put very good players together in a framework that suited them. Added to this, of course, was the Anfield aura, when simply pulling on the red shirt of Liverpool built you up in stature. It was true of players such as Ron Yeats and Ian St John, and you can see it today in the likes of Nick Barmby. So why did it go wrong for them for most of the Nineties? Liverpool's great strength - promoting from within - was also a weakness when the game started to change a decade ago. The managerial succession from Shankly to Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan to Kenny Dalglish was a smooth transition underpinned by the wisdom of their boot room. It started to go wrong when Graeme Souness arrived with ideas gleaned from his time in Italy and as manager of Rangers. One of the first things he tried to change was the drinking culture that was prevalent, not just at Liverpool but throughout British football. I know from experience that this doesn't always go down well, with players or fans. There is an old school of players who believe in working hard and drinking hard.</p> <p>Souness wasn't the first manager to confront the issue - Alex Ferguson did it at Manchester United and years earlier Bobby Robson did something similar at Ipswich. It is no coincidence that both clubs had success with foreign players, and the influence of overseas players and coaches cannot be underestimated. Now the biggest single influence on Liverpool has been the arrival of Houllier, who has done exactly what Souness tried to do and was lambasted for. In the 100 or so games that he has had sole responsibility for the side, he has turned them into a very impressive outfit. His initial appointment alongside Roy Evans was not a great success, and I think joint managements are doomed to failure. I got to know Roy working with him at Fulham last season and I think the problem he and Houllier faced initially was rooting out players who were not totally committed.</p> <p>Now Houllier has got the balance of his squad just right. He knows the importance of a youth system that has developed players such as Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard, but has also made some very shrewd signings, both at home and abroad. Jari Litmanen and Gary McAllister are still hugely influential players. I think it was no coincidence that McAllister was not playing when we beat Liverpool 2-1 in the first leg of our Worthington Cup semi-final last month. He was back for the return leg and we all know what happened there. Litmanen's speed of thought and control means he can orchestrate quick counter-attacks. </p> <p>What was striking about their performance in Rome was the quality of Liverpool's movement. They have quite a direct style in a fairly rigid 4-4-2 framework, and can keep their shape well while pulling opposing defences apart. They work the ball from front to back quickly and without fuss. They are not easy to play against because they can play at a high tempo, requiring supreme fitness, which makes it very hard to sit back against them. And if you go at them, they can punish you on the break.</p> <p>I was in Lyon to watch Arsenal's win and I have to say the two best players by some distance were those old English lionhearts Tony Adams and David Seaman.

      "body": "<p>Gerard who? That was the headline in one newspaper after Liverpool appointed a bespectacled French former schoolteacher to share managerial duties with, and ultimately to succeed, the popular Roy Evans two-and-a-half years ago. The insularity was nothing new, an identical headline having greeted his compatriot Ars\u00e9ne Wenger two years earlier. But, while Wenger quickly won favour with his early achievements at Arsenal, the process has taken a little longer on Merseyside. </p> <p>The arrival of G\u00e9rard Houllier represented a radical deviation from Anfield's boot-room philosophy, an unsophisticated notion based on the twin foundations of industry and teamwork. An unashamed 'thinker' about the game and a devotee of a more scientific approach, the former coach of the French national team initially provoked widespread suspicion, among players and supporters. </p> <p>Stories, not all of them apocryphal, abounded about bewildered looks among the senior players as he quoted Marcel Proust or Milan Kundera in team-talks. Houllier rubbed up supporters the wrong way by eulogising Manchester United, declaring that it would take years even to compete with them, while bookmakers, reacting to the acquisition of several faceless foreigners the summer before last, suggested he would be on the next boat back to France. </p> <p>So where did it all go right? How did the Frenchman (as he is disparagingly labelled to this day by the club's former striker Ian St John, now an outspoken radio commentator), whose name was barely sung by the Kop in his first 12 months, suddenly find himself elevated to demi-god status on Merseyside. The stunning 2-0 victory away to AS Roma, the leaders of Serie A, in Thursday's Uefa Cup fourth round first leg was his finest hour yet, but he characteristically played it down: 'Another step towards where we want to be.' </p> <p>Several more significant steps could be made over the next seven days, in three different cups. But, even were they to end this most promising of seasons without a trophy, Liverpool supporters can rest assured that Houllier has put them back on track for success. </p> <p>'For me, it doesn't mean anything that I didn't know before,' he said. 'I maintain that Roma are an outstanding team and it doesn't mean that we are now on their level. All it is is another sign of the progress we're making. It's a means to an end. I said before the game that the media would see it as a test for us, because of the club's past, but I didn't. I saw it as a chance. It was a privilege and a step forward in the building process.' </p> <p>Houllier referred to his team last season as embryonic. If this campaign, which has featured marked advances in all areas of the side's development, is the gestation period, then the birth, or rather the rebirth of Liverpool as a major footballing power, ought to take place within the next 18 months, in keeping with the timescale he set upon taking sole charge in November 1998. </p> <p>'It took Manchester United four years under Alex Ferguson to win a trophy and another three to win a championship,' he often points out. While Houllier's inheritance at Anfield was hardly as meagre as Ferguson's at Old Trafford, the parallels are numerous. Both sought immediately to change the culture of the club, rooting out the boozers or those who had become too comfortable with second best. </p> <p>Today's FA Cup rival manager Joe Royle says: 'They are a growing force. For those already looking for next season's challengers, although Arsenal haven't gone away, Liverpool could be the most serious challengers. They've got a strong squad and, in the three strikers plus Barmby, Gerrard and Carragher, they have the fullest hand of English players in the league.' </p> <p>Houllier was castigated this time last year for spending a reported \u00a311 million on Emile Heskey, an infrequent goalscorer with Leicester City and a player seemingly unable to punch his weight. Now Heskey is likely to be the focal point of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's England attack. His chosen pairing of Sami Hyypia and Stephane Henchoz, two hitherto anonymous defenders, also raised eyebrows, but they have restricted opponents to just seven goals in the past 19 games. Henchoz, in particular, was majestic in Rome. </p> <p>There was the recent 'crisis' surrounding Robbie Fowler after another late-night incident. Offers came in from Aston Villa and Chelsea, but Houllier ordered his board to turn them down. The forward appreciated that support and, after two years of trouble on and off the pitch, the question marks over his future have disappeared. </p> <p>On Heskey, Houllier says. 'I said [to the media]: \"Be patient because I think he will be a good player.\" Now I no longer hear people say he is not worth \u00a311 million, which, by the way, is more than we paid for him. As for Robbie, I think he appreciated the support. If we had been forced to sell him, it would have been because we'd not been able to persuade Robbie to do the right thing, but I'd have regarded that as failure.' </p> <p>Failure on the pitch would, in the manager's eyes, be failing to qualify, again, for the Champions League, currently the preserve of United, Arsenal and Leeds. Most important in the long term, though, is the continuation of the year-on-year progress that he feels will lead ultimately to the recapture of the league title that the club once regarded as their own. </p> <p>The much-vaunted 'French revolution' has been anything but: Houllier has insisted on patience throughout the evolution of his team and that patience is now being rewarded. No longer do a blinkered minority of supporters react to every slip-up by calling for his head on phone-ins. No longer do the players raise eyebrows at his technical findings or literary references. </p> <p>Whatever happens over the next week, nobody now needs to ask: 'Gerard Who?'</p>",

An unashamed 'thinker' about the game and a devotee of a more scientific approach, the former coach of the French national team initially provoked widespread suspicion, among players and supporters. Stories, not all of them apocryphal, abounded about bewildered looks among the senior players as he quoted Marcel Proust or Milan Kundera in team-talks. Houllier rubbed up supporters the wrong way by eulogising Manchester United, declaring that it would take years even to compete with them, while bookmakers, reacting to the acquisition of several faceless foreigners the summer before last, suggested he would be on the next boat back to France. So where did it all go right? How did the Frenchman (as he is disparagingly labelled to this day by the club's former striker Ian St John, now an outspoken radio commentator), whose name was barely sung by the Kop in his first 12 months, suddenly find himself elevated to demi-god status on Merseyside. The stunning 2-0 victory away to AS Roma, the leaders of Serie A, in Thursday's Uefa Cup fourth round first leg was his finest hour yet, but he characteristically played it down: 'Another step towards where we want to be.' Several more significant steps could be made over the next seven days, in three different cups. But, even were they to end this most promising of seasons without a trophy, Liverpool supporters can rest assured that Houllier has put them back on track for success. 'For me, it doesn't mean anything that I didn't know before,' he said. 'I maintain that Roma are an outstanding team and it doesn't mean that we are now on their level. All it is is another sign of the progress we're making. It's a means to an end. I said before the game that the media would see it as a test for us, because of the club's past, but I didn't. I saw it as a chance. It was a privilege and a step forward in the building process.' Houllier referred to his team last season as embryonic. If this campaign, which has featured marked advances in all areas of the side's development, is the gestation period, then the birth, or rather the rebirth of Liverpool as a major footballing power, ought to take place within the next 18 months, in keeping with the timescale he set upon taking sole charge in November 1998. 'It took Manchester United four years under Alex Ferguson to win a trophy and another three to win a championship,' he often points out. While Houllier's inheritance at Anfield was hardly as meagre as Ferguson's at Old Trafford, the parallels are numerous. Both sought immediately to change the culture of the club, rooting out the boozers or those who had become too comfortable with second best. Today's FA Cup rival manager Joe Royle says: 'They are a growing force. For those already looking for next season's challengers, although Arsenal haven't gone away, Liverpool could be the most serious challengers. They've got a strong squad and, in the three strikers plus Barmby, Gerrard and Carragher, they have the fullest hand of English players in the league.' Houllier was castigated this time last year for spending a reported \u00a311 million on Emile Heskey, an infrequent goalscorer with Leicester City and a player seemingly unable to punch his weight. Now Heskey is likely to be the focal point of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's England attack. His chosen pairing of Sami Hyypia and Stephane Henchoz, two hitherto anonymous defenders, also raised eyebrows, but they have restricted opponents to just seven goals in the past 19 games. Henchoz, in particular, was majestic in Rome. There was the recent 'crisis' surrounding Robbie Fowler after another late-night incident. Offers came in from Aston Villa and Chelsea, but Houllier ordered his board to turn them down. The forward appreciated that support and, after two years of trouble on and off the pitch, the question marks over his future have disappeared. On Heskey, Houllier says. 'I said [to the media]: \"Be patient because I think he will be a good player.\" Now I no longer hear people say he is not worth \u00a311 million, which, by the way, is more than we paid for him. As for Robbie, I think he appreciated the support. If we had been forced to sell him, it would have been because we'd not been able to persuade Robbie to do the right thing, but I'd have regarded that as failure.' Failure on the pitch would, in the manager's eyes, be failing to qualify, again, for the Champions League, currently the preserve of United, Arsenal and Leeds. Most important in the long term, though, is the continuation of the year-on-year progress that he feels will lead ultimately to the recapture of the league title that the club once regarded as their own. The much-vaunted 'French revolution' has been anything but: Houllier has insisted on patience throughout the evolution of his team and that patience is now being rewarded. No longer do a blinkered minority of supporters react to every slip-up by calling for his head on phone-ins. No longer do the players raise eyebrows at his technical findings or literary references. Whatever happens over the next week, nobody now needs to ask: 'Gerard Who?'",

Granted, the Uefa Cup is fairly small potatoes these days, and Roma did not appear to take the tie as seriously as they might, but comparing the exhilarating efficiency of Liverpool's win to their shambolic performances in Europe in G\u00e9rard Houllier's first season provided the best evidence yet that Anfield is emerging from a decade of anonymity. </p> <p>Ten years ago this Thursday the football world was shocked, and the Gulf War briefly pushed out of the headlines, by the news that Kenny Dalglish had relinquished his position as Liverpool manager. </p> <p>Shock, for once, was not too strong a word. Dalglish then had not fully developed the flinty exterior of today. He was a young, relatively inexperienced manager under enormous strain after Hillsborough. It was only his reluctance to acknowledge the pressure of the situation, because victims' families had had it much worse, which convinced everyone he was coping. With hindsight, we should not have been so surprised. But Dalglish himself would have been amazed, as would anyone in 1991, to be told that Liverpool would fail to qualify for Europe's premier competition for the next 10 years. </p> <p>Liverpool dominated the Seventies and Eighties as comprehensively as Manchester United came to dominate the Nineties, and with four European Cups along the way they set a standard no British club and very few continentals could match. They seemed as invincible two decades ago as United appear now, but somehow more laudably so. </p> <p>United fans, players even, don't mind admitting they worry about what will happen when Sir Alex Ferguson steps down, but for a while it appeared Liverpool had the continuity problem cracked. Without Manchester's merchandise millions or Read Madrid's insane overdraft, Liverpool quietly created a true footballing dynasty in which players and managers came and went but success remained a constant. </p> <p>Until 1991. All Liverpool have won since then is one FA Cup (in 1992, against Sunderland) and one Coca-Cola Cup (in 1995, against Bolton). Another League Cup final awaits in Cardiff this Sunday, but with respect to Trevor Francis's side, when you have been brought up on victories over Roma and Real, and have just had to witness Manchester United carrying off the most glamorous of trebles, it is hard to get worked up about beating Birmingham City. </p> <p>Not that Liverpool fans are ungrateful, for the past or the present. Tommy Smith, a link with Bill Shankly's Sixties side as well as a goalscorer in Rome in Liverpool's first European Cup final, has spent the past 10 years conducting one of football's liveliest letters columns in the Liverpool Echo 's Saturday Pink. </p> <p>'On the whole the supporters have been patient and understanding,' Smith said. 'Well, they've had to be haven't they? Not even the most biased Liverpool fan could deny the last decade has belonged to Manchester United. Liverpool supporters appreciate that after dominating for so long it was bound to be someone else's turn soon.' </p> <p>That does not mean they are happy about it. Now that three English clubs go forward each season the Champions League has become the place to play, and there is no excuse for a club of Liverpool's stature continuing to watch from the sidelines. </p> <p>When the principle of non-champions entering the Champions League was first mooted, Liverpool were instinctively against it. 'Letting in more than one team per country dilutes the idea of a tournament for champions,' said Roy Evans, manager at the time. 'Keeping the European Cup exclusive also prevents it operating to the detriment of the domestic league.' </p> <p>True enough, but the reality is that you can't win the domestic league these days without embracing the Champions League. Squads of the size and strength of Manchester United or Arsenal are not going to be overtaken by more parsimonious operations with a narrower outlook. Hence Houllier's insistence that you need four quality strikers to compete. Hence Sir Alan Sugar going to court over allegations of miserliness, or Aston Villa constantly being accused of lacking ambition. That option is not available to Liverpool. </p> <p>'European qualification is a more or less constant aspiration at Liverpool,' Evans said. 'That's what the club is geared for, and that's what managers are expected to deliver.' </p> <p>After finishing as far down as seventh and eighth in the past decade, the closest Liverpool have come to the Champions League was last season when they slipped out of the top three in the final week. That was the end of Houllier's first full season in sole charge, after the not-so-bright experiment of having the Frenchman and Evans working together. The more convincing manner in which Liverpool are pursuing a Champions League place this season suggests they have at least found the right manager. </p> <p>'This one is in charge, and everybody knows that,' Smith said. 'Before he arrived I think the players were running the place. Houllier seems such a nice, polite chap on the surface, but he's got the hardness all managers need. One or two players tried to test him out and came off worse. He's not afraid to show people the door, and he's won the respect of the players and the fans.' </p> <p>It is too simplistic to blame managers for football teams' failings, and while a degree of criticism can be levelled at every Anfield appointment since Liverpool last won the league, the same could be said of almost every under-achieving club in the country. </p> <p>From this distance it is easy to conclude the intense, abrasive Graeme Souness was the wrong man for a situation made fraught by the manner of Dalglish's departure, and the popular view of Evans as an easygoing antidote who was promoted beyond his ability, tends to be backed by his record since leaving Liverpool. </p> <p>Yet it should also be acknowledged that finding the right coach to take over a champion team is notoriously difficult, as some of the biggest names in sport can testify. This is precisely why Manchester United supporters are getting jittery, and why Houllier, in building up a side from a relatively low base, is performing a subtly different task to any of his immediate predecessors. The last Anfield manager to have to do that was Shankly, and by virtue of their clever policy of in-house appointments Liverpool managed to avoid the issue for the next 30 years until Dalglish's abdication left them with a succession crisis. </p> <p>Evans, who ought to know after 35 years in and around it, reckons too much has been made of the cult of the boot room. 'It was only a cubby-hole under the stand. The strange thing about Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan, two of the greatest managers it produced, was that neither of them actually wanted the job. Not at the start, anyway. They both ended up taking it because they were worried we would all lose our jobs if a new man came in.' </p> <p>Dalglish wanted it from the start, despite knowing it would shorten his playing career. Souness wanted it so badly he took it on even after presciently hoping he would not be remembered as a failed manager rather than a successful player. By 1994, Evans claimed he would have started to look elsewhere had he been passed over. The more people wanted the job, the harder it got. The more new faces who arrived, the less they looked like Liverpool players. </p> <p>suddenly people were experiencing difficulty for the first time in putting names to the faces in the red shirts. Some of the ones they could name - Neil Ruddock, Paul Stewart, Julian Dicks and Jason McAteer spring to mind - never convinced. Dean Saunders, who at his best was of the required quality, found that no sooner had he achieved his lifetime ambition of joining Liverpool than he was on his travels again. </p> <p>'I'll always be grateful for winning the FA Cup with Liverpool, but their expectations were so high you always had the sense that nothing short of winning the title was really good enough,' Saunders said. 'There was a slightly depressing atmosphere around the place, as if everyone knew they weren't quite matching up. Graeme called me in one day and told me he needed a centre-half [Torben Piechnik], and that he could raise the money by selling me to Aston Villa. I couldn't believe he was prepared to let me go, but he said he didn't think my partnership with Ian Rush had worked out, and Rushy wouldn't be the one going anywhere. That was it.' It happens in football, of course, but it never used to happen at Anfield. </p> <p>'Things did get very intense under Graeme, but that was just a reflection of his personality,' Evans said. 'He always tried his hardest for the club. I'm a more laid-back type of person, the Liverpudlian in me likes to see people having a laugh at work. Football should be about enjoyment.' </p> <p>Amen to that. It is often forgotten that when Shankly made his famous quip about football being more important than life and death, he was joking. Houllier shares a similar sense of humour and proportion, though Liverpool don't joke about life and death any more. </p> <p>'The club could never be quite the same again after Heysel,' Smith said. 'The ban set the whole of English football back, and the repercussions lasted a lot longer than five years. </p> <p>'Manchester United had so much ground to make up it took them nearly all the Nineties to win the European Cup. I wouldn't be surprised if they won it again this year, because it's the only cup they are still in. Fair play to them, they're a good side. But Liverpool are getting back there. And they are still in three cups.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "The bombing of Iraq may have provided President George W. Bush with a splendid opportunity to project himself as a strong leader, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair with a fresh opportunity to underline the 'special relationship' between Washington and London, but the diplomatic price to pay will be heavy. The grounds on which they ordered the air strikes are weak. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, under which the United States and the United Kingdom have declared and maintained air exclusion sectors for Baghdad, has no provision for such zones. The timing of the bombing was disastrous: a week before the US Secretary of State Colin Powell starts his Middle East tour to shore up anti-Saddam resistance in the Arab world; and 10 days before Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammadal Sahhaf meets the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss revived UN inspections under the year-old Security Council Resolution 1284. In briefings the defence ministries in Washington and London have accused Iraq of upgrading its air defence system to improve its chance of hitting an Anglo-American plane enforcing the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. But since December 1998, when Saddam ordered his forces to stop what he calls foreign violations of Iraqi airspace, his air defence personnel have failed to score a single hit, while Anglo-American aircraft have carried out 30,000 sorties into Iraq. While the dispute between Saddam Hussein and the United Nations centred on UN inspectors disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, the issue was easily understood by the general public, and popular opinion could be mobilised against the Iraqi dictator. But inspectors are no longer in the picture. Richard Butler, head of UN Special Commission (Unscom) for disarmament, withdrew them in 1998 so that the Pentagon, backed by Britain, could stage its four-day blitzkrieg against Iraq during which it fired 425 Cruise and Tomahawk missiles - 90 more than during the 43-day Gulf War. More seriously, the Anglo-American imposition and maintenance of the air exclusion zones have no international legal basis. America and Britain refer to Security Council Resolution 688, passed on 5 April 1991 in the wake of the Kurdish refugee crisis created by Saddam Hussein after the Gulf War. In fact, there is no provision for air exclusion zones in Resolution 688. At the Security Council, Russia and China have repeatedly pointed this out, adding that the US-UK action is a violation of international law. France, which initially participated in the air policing, pulled out of the northern zone in September 1996 after the outbreak of intra-Kurdish fighting in which one faction involved Saddam Hussein's military to defeat the other. Paris withdrew from the southern zone after the Anglo-Americans mounted Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 which resulted in a 100-hour non-stop bombing of Iraq. During his forthcoming tour of the Middle East, Colin Powell will discover that Arab public opinion has been inflamed by images of dead and wounded Iraqis, brought into Arab homes by several Arabic-language satellite television channels. Such images will make even the leaders of the pro-American regimes in Cairo and Amman unwilling to join a new crusade against Iraq. Even before the latest air strikes against Iraq, Arab states - except Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - were busy mending fences with Baghdad, and calling for the lifting of UN sanctions. 'We can't expect the people of Iraq to live under sanctions for ever,' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told the Davos economic conference last month. 'Since the Gulf War, public opinion in the Arab world has moved 180 degrees.' The belief on the Arab street is that President Bush has used the pretext of Iraq upgrading its air defence to punish Saddam for the vocal and material support he is providing to the Palestinian intifada. The Iraqi leader has repeatedly declared that only 'jihad' will lead to the liberation of Palestine. He has also dispatched convoys of food and medicine to the Palestinian territories via Jordan. His representatives have been handing out cheques of $10,000 each to the families of the martyred Palestinians - five times the sum the Palestinian Authority offers. Inadvertently or otherwise, Bush and Blair have destroyed any chance Kofi Annan had of working out a plan for UN inspections when he meets the Iraqi Foreign Minister later this month. In launching Operation Desert Fox, the American and British chief executives achieved the satisfaction of making full use of the intelligence that their administrations had gathered over several years, and inflicted a robust blow against Saddam's regime. But what resulted was a full withdrawal of UN inspectors, thus providing the Iraqi leader with a strong diplomatic lever to renegotiate the con-ditions on which they would be allowed to return. The 1998 American and British military action made the breach between them and Russia, France and China unbridgeable. It immobilised the Security Council. And it took a whole year to draft a new resolution - 1284 - which lacks the authority of a unanimously passed document due to the abstention of Russia, France and China. Once again, having had the satisfaction of teaching Saddam a military lesson, Washington and London will find it will cost them a hefty diplomatic price.

      "body": "<p>Britain's most influential arbiter of public taste, the film censor, is predicting the end of legally enforced cinema ratings in the UK. In a speech on the future of censorship this week, Robin Duval will argue that greater freedom for film-makers and audiences is on its way.</p> <p>'We are pretty much the only country left to enforce a film rating system by law,' he said. 'In most of northern Europe and the Americas, film regulation is advisory and not mandatory. How long will Britain keep this up? As the internet and new media become more available, everyone wonders why one medium is regulated by law and another isn't.'</p> <p>Duval, director of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for just over two years, does not expect all forms of film classification to disappear. He envisages a grading scheme in which parents would be able to take children to seefilms they deem suitable. Existing legislation covering obscenity and child abuse would then become the only statutory public protection. In contrast, when the late Princess Diana controversially took an under-age Prince Harry to see the 15-certificate film The Devil's Own , the London cinema involved was threatened with prosecution under the 1985 Cinemas Act.</p> <p>'I suspect film producers will still want their product to be given some sort of bill of health,' said Duval, 'but I think the legal nature of it will change fairly soon. Television will have to have its own ratings system too.'</p> <p>Duval will use his speech at the Royal Society of Arts on Wednesday to call on the Government to rethink its policy on monitoring broadcast standards. New Labour plans for one giant, over-arching watchdog to look after film, television and the internet are dangerous, he will argue, and are also based on false assumptions.</p> <p>The Government's parliamentary consultation document on the communications industry, published at Christmas, outlined plans for a new body, dubbed OfCom, to take over the roles of the Independent Television Commission, the Broadcasting Standards Council, the Radio Authority, the Radio Communications Agency and Oftel.</p> <p>Duval said: 'There would be too much power in one institution - a supreme cultural regulator. Video and film would be lost within the broadcast bias of this watchdog.'</p> <p>OfCom has been billed by the Government as a simplification of conflicting standards as the worlds of new media and broadcasting converge. But Duval and his colleagues at the BBFC, including the president, Andreas Whittam Smith, are not convinced by the argument that filmed entertainment will all soon be delivered via the internet. 'There are a lot of assumptions being made that people will gravitate towards their homes,' said Duval. 'It is doubtful whether the expectation of this great convergence is justified.</p> <p>'People want to have somewhere to go in the evening. There are actually now three times more people going to the cinema than in the middle of the 1980s.' Duval believes it will take a long time for the internet to become a central part of the film business. Sport is still the driving force behind home satellite and digital ownership and no film channel yet receives more than 1 per cent of viewing figures.</p> <p>Attitudes to sex on screen have been deliberately relaxed since Duval and Whittam Smith have been in charge at the BBFC. 'We carried out research into public attitudes last year and there was a clear message,' said Duval. 'People believed the BBFC was being quite unnecessarily nannyish when it came to questions of sex, but attitudes to violence were less tolerant.' The BBFC's rating categories would continue to be rigorous over violence. Duval said that although the link between people seeing violence on screen and committing it was poor, the BBFC had to respond to public feeling.</p> <p>Public acceptability is one of the BBFC's main criteria for rating films. 'The only statutory restriction we have is on violence towards animals under the 1937 Animals Act. We also have some restrictions under the Obscene Publications Act,' said Duval.</p> <p>The BBFC ensures there is no mention of drugs in U-rated films. Even at PG level, however, there is more scope for referring to illicit substances, while at a 12-rating Duval says audiences are allowed to 'enter the real world', as long as there is no appearance of promoting drugs. 'Broadly, we have to steer away from \"imitable techniques\".

      "bodyText": "Britain's most influential arbiter of public taste, the film censor, is predicting the end of legally enforced cinema ratings in the UK. In a speech on the future of censorship this week, Robin Duval will argue that greater freedom for film-makers and audiences is on its way. 'We are pretty much the only country left to enforce a film rating system by law,' he said. 'In most of northern Europe and the Americas, film regulation is advisory and not mandatory. How long will Britain keep this up? As the internet and new media become more available, everyone wonders why one medium is regulated by law and another isn't.' Duval, director of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for just over two years, does not expect all forms of film classification to disappear. He envisages a grading scheme in which parents would be able to take children to seefilms they deem suitable. Existing legislation covering obscenity and child abuse would then become the only statutory public protection. In contrast, when the late Princess Diana controversially took an under-age Prince Harry to see the 15-certificate film The Devil's Own , the London cinema involved was threatened with prosecution under the 1985 Cinemas Act. 'I suspect film producers will still want their product to be given some sort of bill of health,' said Duval, 'but I think the legal nature of it will change fairly soon. Television will have to have its own ratings system too.' Duval will use his speech at the Royal Society of Arts on Wednesday to call on the Government to rethink its policy on monitoring broadcast standards. New Labour plans for one giant, over-arching watchdog to look after film, television and the internet are dangerous, he will argue, and are also based on false assumptions. The Government's parliamentary consultation document on the communications industry, published at Christmas, outlined plans for a new body, dubbed OfCom, to take over the roles of the Independent Television Commission, the Broadcasting Standards Council, the Radio Authority, the Radio Communications Agency and Oftel. Duval said: 'There would be too much power in one institution - a supreme cultural regulator. Video and film would be lost within the broadcast bias of this watchdog.' OfCom has been billed by the Government as a simplification of conflicting standards as the worlds of new media and broadcasting converge. But Duval and his colleagues at the BBFC, including the president, Andreas Whittam Smith, are not convinced by the argument that filmed entertainment will all soon be delivered via the internet. 'There are a lot of assumptions being made that people will gravitate towards their homes,' said Duval. 'It is doubtful whether the expectation of this great convergence is justified. 'People want to have somewhere to go in the evening. There are actually now three times more people going to the cinema than in the middle of the 1980s.' Duval believes it will take a long time for the internet to become a central part of the film business. Sport is still the driving force behind home satellite and digital ownership and no film channel yet receives more than 1 per cent of viewing figures. Attitudes to sex on screen have been deliberately relaxed since Duval and Whittam Smith have been in charge at the BBFC. 'We carried out research into public attitudes last year and there was a clear message,' said Duval. 'People believed the BBFC was being quite unnecessarily nannyish when it came to questions of sex, but attitudes to violence were less tolerant.' The BBFC's rating categories would continue to be rigorous over violence. Duval said that although the link between people seeing violence on screen and committing it was poor, the BBFC had to respond to public feeling. Public acceptability is one of the BBFC's main criteria for rating films. 'The only statutory restriction we have is on violence towards animals under the 1937 Animals Act. We also have some restrictions under the Obscene Publications Act,' said Duval. The BBFC ensures there is no mention of drugs in U-rated films. Even at PG level, however, there is more scope for referring to illicit substances, while at a 12-rating Duval says audiences are allowed to 'enter the real world', as long as there is no appearance of promoting drugs. 'Broadly, we have to steer away from \"imitable techniques\". And we will not allow any detail of a hanging in a 15-film,' he said. Duval believes he has seen the end of the recent tide of violent horror films. However, he is concerned that the industry is about to erupt into a spate of brutal adventure movies. In contrast to current British concerns, American censorship has been tougher on sex than violence. In 1929 the Hays Office Code ruled that married couples had to be shown in twin beds and that one foot must stay on the floor in love scenes, lest the nation's collective morals were damaged. vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk",

'I came home, went into the kitchen and started to cook, and after a while I realised that I'd forgotten about work completely, I was so happy,' she recalls. </p> <p>That all-important revelation helped her finally to make the decision to change careers, giving up her lucrative job in corporate affairs with a multinational company to train as a chef. </p> <p>Like many people, Julia, now 31, had found herself doing a job that she hadn't exactly planned and in which she felt unfulfilled. 'I had that Sunday evening feeling every week, and I dreaded Monday mornings,' she says. Unlike most people, she decided to do something about it, first seeing a careers counsellor, then seeking the help of a coach, who provided vital support to help her take the big step of switching to a new career. </p> <p>Her coach, Veronica Lim, showed her how to 'deconstruct' the transition, so that it became less frightening, helped her to shed her fear of upsetting others' expectations and also to think through how she would feel about having less money to live on for the year she was training. 'I was determined I wouldn't get to the end of my life saying \"what if\"?' she says. 'Now it feels as if I've come home.' </p> <p>Some people are forced to change career because of redundancy or other circumstances. There's not much call for athletes or footballers in their forties, after all. But to do so of your own volition can be a daunting affair; there's often the prospect of sacrificing salary, status and security. But thousands take the plunge every year, while friends and colleagues watch in envy. </p> <p>Rachel Turner of the Lifecoaching Company, which helped Julia Brett, says: 'People dissatisfied with their careers often don't know what they want. Advisers might give them psychometric tests but we help them to ask their own questions, to look at where they are now, where they want to be, and to find a strategy to bridge that gap.' </p> <p>Much dissatisfaction stems from the fact that people have to choose a career when they are very young, and ill-equipped to do so. In some cases, they have a calling they only discover later in life; in others, their needs change as they grow older. 'For example, it might be fine to work on a high-adrenaline trading floor when you are in your twenties, but when you want to have a better work-life balance it doesn't fit anymore - a bit like growing out of a suit of clothes.' </p> <p>The decision to change careers is usually made over a period of time, she says: 'People don't just wake up one morning and decide they want to make leather belts in the Cotswolds.' The important thing is to work out a strategy, taking account of the practical issues, especially money. 'That may mean the transition takes six months, or even two years, but it's difficult to achieve your goals if you can't pay the bills.' </p> <p>Margaret Stead, an occupational psychologist, whose company Career Design International provides counselling and coaching, believes that many people end up in the wrong job because they receive poor careers advice at school. 'They don't have time to sit down with a pupil to find out what that person is really good at and what they enjoy.' Many people are far too short-term in their outlook, she says, easily flattered by the offer of a job, and not thinking where they would like to be in five or 10 years' time. </p> <p>She believes that helping people to find the right career is a question of identifying what is important to them, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. She cites the example of a quality manager in the food manufacturing industry who was 'bored out of his mind'. According to Stead: 'It was a question of looking at what he could be passionate about. He was very keen on travel, and he'd taught himself circus skills. We looked at travel firms with room for an entertainments manager, and he's now working for a company in the South of France.' In other cases, she says, a much less radical change may be needed. For example, somebody may find that working from home injects their career with a new lease of life. </p> <p>Although men and women are equally likely to feel the urge to change career, women may have a better chance of doing so, since having children can become a natural break to reconsider their objectives, whereas for men children can mean heightened pressure to keep earning to support the family. </p> <p>'Women returning to the workforce tend to look at what they really want to do, and how they can make it fit in with their home life,' says Stead. Those who do successfully switch careers find the benefits can be dramatic. Sarah Whittaker gave up a career as an account manager with an IT firm to set herself up as an image consultant, which involves helping people to devise their personal style and wardrobe. She had always had an interest in fashion and felt unfulfilled in IT. Now she says: 'I feel that I'm using far more of my natural skills than before. I can choose when I work and the people I work with, and a lot of the jobs are really rewarding, for instance, when I work on somebody's wedding.' </p> <p>Careful planning, supported by Rachel Turner's coaching, has put Whittaker on track to achieving the income she had in her old job, thanks to contracts with clients such as lastminute.com and confetti.co.uk. </p> <p>Like Julia Brett, she says she used to dread Mondays. 'Now it doesn't matter what day of the week it is - it's just another day.'</p>",

Margaret Stead, an occupational psychologist, whose company Career Design International provides counselling and coaching, believes that many people end up in the wrong job because they receive poor careers advice at school. 'They don't have time to sit down with a pupil to find out what that person is really good at and what they enjoy.' Many people are far too short-term in their outlook, she says, easily flattered by the offer of a job, and not thinking where they would like to be in five or 10 years' time. She believes that helping people to find the right career is a question of identifying what is important to them, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. She cites the example of a quality manager in the food manufacturing industry who was 'bored out of his mind'. According to Stead: 'It was a question of looking at what he could be passionate about. He was very keen on travel, and he'd taught himself circus skills. We looked at travel firms with room for an entertainments manager, and he's now working for a company in the South of France.' In other cases, she says, a much less radical change may be needed. For example, somebody may find that working from home injects their career with a new lease of life. Although men and women are equally likely to feel the urge to change career, women may have a better chance of doing so, since having children can become a natural break to reconsider their objectives, whereas for men children can mean heightened pressure to keep earning to support the family. 'Women returning to the workforce tend to look at what they really want to do, and how they can make it fit in with their home life,' says Stead. Those who do successfully switch careers find the benefits can be dramatic. Sarah Whittaker gave up a career as an account manager with an IT firm to set herself up as an image consultant, which involves helping people to devise their personal style and wardrobe. She had always had an interest in fashion and felt unfulfilled in IT. Now she says: 'I feel that I'm using far more of my natural skills than before. I can choose when I work and the people I work with, and a lot of the jobs are really rewarding, for instance, when I work on somebody's wedding.' Careful planning, supported by Rachel Turner's coaching, has put Whittaker on track to achieving the income she had in her old job, thanks to contracts with clients such as lastminute.com and confetti.co.uk. Like Julia Brett, she says she used to dread Mondays. 'Now it doesn't matter what day of the week it is - it's just another day.'",

As every ex-employee of the late Boo.com now laments, 'It was such a great company to work for'. You bet.
