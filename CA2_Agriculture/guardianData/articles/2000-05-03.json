The 8,500-strong UN mission - mainly comprising Indians, Kenyans and Nigerians - is a key element in the west African country's shaky peace process, now made even more unstable by the killings. Reinforcements have been sent to some UN positions and security has been stepped up in Freetown, the seaside capital, where there were helicopters hovering overhead yesterday morning. Since Monday the rebel Revolutionary United Front, which remains, at least officially, part of a power-sharing government, has seized 50 UN workers during incidents in three towns in the interior, officials said. The whereabouts of many more remains unclear. Four Kenyan peacekeepers were killed on Tuesday during a gunfight with the rebels in the central town of Magburaka, according to a senior official. The rebels signed a ceasefire last July in Togo. Philip Winslow, a spokesman for Unamsil, the UN mission in Sierra Leone, said that fighters of the RUF had attacked UN positions in Magburaka and the nearby city of Makeni. The peacekeepers returned fire. The UN force commander, Major-General Vijay Kumar Jetley, said on Tuesday: \"It seems as if Foday Sankoh [the RUF leader] is trying to derail the peace process.\" Mr Sankoh, who was brought into the government as part of a power-sharing agreement last year, has been refusing to talk to government members, including President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, in recent days. The kidnappings began on Monday after about 100 armed RUF guerrillas surrounded a demobilisation centre in Makeni, demanding the return of 10 fighters who had turned in their weapons. When the UN troops refused, the rebels fired into the air and seized a UN military observer. Another three observers and three peacekeepers were captured after going to negotiate their colleague's release. AP",

Ms Murdoch, 31, announced yesterday that she is to leave BSkyB, in which her father has a stake, to set up her own independent production company. </p> <p>The move took the broadcasting world by surprise, although friends of Ms Murdoch said she had been thinking about leaving Sky for some time. As well as giving up her role at Sky, she has quit the executive committee of Mr Murdoch's sprawling News Corp empire. </p> <p>As managing director of Sky Networks, Ms Murdoch played a key role in attempts to reposition the broadcaster's entertainment channel, Sky One, as a rival to BBC1 and ITV. She was overlooked for the position of chief executive when the post became vacant at BSkyB last year, and one source suggested that the snub had been a \"wake-up call\". </p> <p>Ms Murdoch told BSkyB's chief executive, Tony Ball, of her move on Friday morning, and is said to have informed her father later. </p> <p>Close friends said last night that the catalyst for her decision to leave Sky came when she discovered she was pregnant by her partner, the flamboyant public relations executive Matthew Freud. According to unconfirmed reports, she would merely be lending her name and contacts to the new venture. Until last night, news of the pregnancy had been a closely guarded secret. </p> <p><strong> Turbulent times</strong><br> </p> <p> Ms Murdoch is understood to have been frustrated by the promotion of her younger brother, Lachlan, 28, within the corporation. Last year he was rewarded with a place on the six-strong board at News Corp - which has a 37.5% stake in BSkyB - becoming the only one of the young Murdoch clan to make it that far. </p> <p>In an interview with the magazine Newsweek last year, Rupert Murdoch had indicated that Lachlan would eventually succeed him at the head of News Corp. Last month Mr Murdoch was diagnosed as suffering from \"low grade\" prostate cancer. </p> <p>At Sky, Ms Murdoch is understood to have had turbulent relations with successive chief executives, Sam Chisholm and Mark Booth. The appointment of Mr Ball to the chief executive's chair last year reportedly prompted Ms Murdoch to reconsider her future there. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day no one likes working with the boss's daughter and her father was not prepared to do the ultimate and put her in charge. Four years on she was still pretty much in the same job as when she joined. And Sky spends more time shifting dishes than it does worrying about creating programmes,\" said one insider. In a statement released through BSkyB yesterday, Ms Murdoch said she was leaving to set up her own production company. The new venture, she said, will be specialising in film, television, and new media. </p> <p>Declaring that she had enjoyed and was proud of her four years' work at Sky, Ms Murdoch said: \"I have had the privilege of working with some of the best television executives around and it is with some lament that I leave such a winning team. However now is a great time to pursue something that I have been thinking about for some time.\" </p> <p>Mr Ball, who succeeded Mr Booth eight months ago, praised Ms Murdoch's work, saying she had been \"pivotal\" in the company's creative development. </p> <p>He added: \"Under her direction, our channels have thrived and led the way in the multi-channel world; we have launched major new film and television divisions, attracted leading talent both in front of and behind the camera to our network, and invigorated our brand through our latest marketing campaign. We will miss her greatly and wish her well with her new venture.\" </p> <p>The statement made no mention of Ms Murdoch's pregnancy, which was later confirmed by her partner's public relations firm. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch's three children employed in the News Corp empire are often depicted in the press as sibling rivals. Lachlan has run the Australian end of the Murdoch empire and has recently taken on the US print business. The youngest son, James, 27, has made a name for himself running the corporation's American internet business and was recently appointed to run StarTV, the group's Asian pay-TV operation. </p> <p>But Mr Murdoch recently anointed Peter Chernin, who built up the Fox television and cinema business, and, at the age of 48, he has a maturity that eludes the Murdoch juniors as his successor in the short term. Mr Murdoch has told Newsweek that his children would have to demonstrate their mettle before he would think of handing over the reins to them. He said: \"They all have to prove themselves first. I don't like contemplating my death. It would certainly be a matter for the board. I would think Peter would probably be the chief executive. Maybe my older son [Lachlan] would become chairman.\" </p> <p>He added, however, that his recent marriage to Wendi Deng, 33, had \"re-energised\" him. </p> <p>The new company will be based in Britain, and News Corp will not be involved in it. Ms Murdoch has negotiated a deal to produce programmes for Sky, but she also intends to supply shows to some other channels. \"This is an audacious move. She is doing something that she feels passionately about,\" a friend commented last night. </p> <p><strong> Shares drop</strong><br> </p> <p> At Sky, Ms Murdoch was heavily involved in attracting top stars and shows to the station, and she is thought to want to pursue her connections now in the entertainment industry. </p> <p>With the growing proliferation of digital channels, a huge market for original programming is developing.

Zakharova changes the pace and the audience is immediately seduced. </p> <p>Making its Scottish debut this week the Kirov, under the youthful directorship of Makhar Vaziev, brings new blood and a rare elegance to a ballet that essentially belongs to the company. Programme notes remind us that La Bayad\u00e8re, a simple story of love lost and found, set exotically in India, was first presented at the Mariinsky Theatre (the Kirov's home) in St Petersburg in 1877 as an extravagant royal entertainment. </p> <p>By rights, it is a museum piece. And the Kirov to some extent seems bound by that - the costumes are high on eastern promise, the sets have that slightly highbrow but dusty look and the format respectfully recreates the classic set pieces. These include crowds, swoony duets, death scenes, folk dance diversions and the little jokey interlude (here, a papier- mache elephant carrying our hero, followed by a tatty tiger trophy). The trappings are traditional, the music by Minkus strangely unmemorable, so what clicks? </p> <p>The dancing itself. On the whole it is good; in parts it is ravishing. The Kirov has allowed much attention to be lavished on its younger proteges, who revel in the sensuous, gestural Russian style inherited through the company that produced Nureyev and Baryshnikov. </p> <p>In the final act our heroine Nikia and her prince Sonor (played with aquiline composure by Farukh Ruzimatov) meet in the Kingdom of Shades, a deathly place. Entering one by one, 32 white tutus spiral in an ever- increasing line to fill the stage. Bend and point, bend and point, repetitively, precisely - nowhere in ballet is the tutu more triumphant as it frames these slowly moving limbs sculpted to perfection by Petipa's choreography. </p> <p>Startlingly close to the rhythms and abstraction of much late 20th-century ballet, this scene is exactingly executed by the Kirov. The ballerinas even seem to breathe collectively as they create their kaleidoscopic patterns across the floor. Soloists in this act also cut shapely figures, thrilling the audience with their complex simplicity. Put all that postmodern irony behind you, and this might just be a new experience.</p>",

These include crowds, swoony duets, death scenes, folk dance diversions and the little jokey interlude (here, a papier- mache elephant carrying our hero, followed by a tatty tiger trophy). The trappings are traditional, the music by Minkus strangely unmemorable, so what clicks? The dancing itself. On the whole it is good; in parts it is ravishing. The Kirov has allowed much attention to be lavished on its younger proteges, who revel in the sensuous, gestural Russian style inherited through the company that produced Nureyev and Baryshnikov. In the final act our heroine Nikia and her prince Sonor (played with aquiline composure by Farukh Ruzimatov) meet in the Kingdom of Shades, a deathly place. Entering one by one, 32 white tutus spiral in an ever- increasing line to fill the stage. Bend and point, bend and point, repetitively, precisely - nowhere in ballet is the tutu more triumphant as it frames these slowly moving limbs sculpted to perfection by Petipa's choreography. Startlingly close to the rhythms and abstraction of much late 20th-century ballet, this scene is exactingly executed by the Kirov. The ballerinas even seem to breathe collectively as they create their kaleidoscopic patterns across the floor. Soloists in this act also cut shapely figures, thrilling the audience with their complex simplicity. Put all that postmodern irony behind you, and this might just be a new experience.",

      "bodyText": "The merger between the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges marks a decisive shift in the balance of power in the struggle over share trading in Europe. Together the two exchanges will form a powerhouse with which other bourses will be forced to come to terms. Separately they could have formed cores of competing groups; now no other combination can rival it. Even before the ink is dry on the deal, Milan and Madrid are preparing to sign up. At the same time the exchanges have neutralised the challenge of the hi-tech US exchange, Nasdaq, which was lining up its European invasion plans but has now opted to join the Anglo-German group. In uniting to form iX, the exchanges are burying years of rivalry, although the time it has taken them to negotiate a deal - nearly two years - indicates the scale of the challenge. It remains to be seen how members react to the merger and whether the two cultures can be brought together. Executives are seeking to bury any notion of London versus Frankfurt and stress that they taking the first steps towards a pan-European exchange. But the structure of the deal shows how carefully national sensitivies have been handled. The new company is a 50:50 joint venture. Its chairman will be British - Don Cruickshank - balancing the appointment of Frankfurt's Werner Seifert as chief executive, who in turn will have to move to London. The capital will provide the administrative base but it is Frankfurt's trading system that will be used there. Trading in blue-chip stocks will be in the City, but the hi-tech market will be centred in Frankfurt. That reflects the success of Frankfurt Neuer Markt but it is also the point at which the merged exchanges will hook up with Nasdaq. That link could prove crucial: it gives London and Frankfurt a global dimension via the Nasdaq's strength in the US and its links with markets in Hong Kong and Japan. \"The market will follow the sun for the biggest companies,\" says Nasdaq chairman and chief executive Frank Zarb. But for all yesterday's cheery camaraderie - shared even by the London exchange's chief executive Gavin Casey, whose job will go under the deal - the two exchanges did not jump into bed together, they were pushed. The initiative came from the big investment banks and fund managers who push billions of pounds worth of trades through the market every day. They want to trade more cheaply, more easily and above all across borders from a single base, rather than needing individual links into 15 exchanges. The pressure has been compounded by the introduction of the single currency in most of the EU which has removed exchange rate risks from cross-border equity deals. \"What we are about here is promoting the efficiency of capital markets in Europe,\" says Mr Cruickshank. But the merger is only one step.

Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Sergei Rebrov and hope to conclude a \u00a310m deal for the Dynamo Kiev striker. </p> <p>The 25-year-old, scorer of eight goals in 12 Champions League appearances this season, is poised to leave Ukraine, and Spurs' director of football David Pleat said yesterday: \"We do have an interest and we have had talks but nothing has been finalised yet.\" </p> <p>Pleat flew to Kiev for a meeting with Dynamo officials last week and has also spoken with Rebrov's agent. Some reports suggested personal terms of \u00a325,000 a week have been settled. Pleat, though, denied that the player had agreed to move to London. \"It depends on many things,\" he said. </p> <p>Tottenham would have to dig deep to sign Rebrov, with Kiev thought to be demanding \u00a312m, twice Spurs' record fee. A bigger hurdle, however, might be persuading the player to join a club who will not be in Europe next season. Last term he was playing in a Champions League semi-final. </p> <p>The Ukrainian has already been linked with moves to both Milan clubs. Inter were said to see him as a replacement for the injured Ronaldo; their city rivals would be obvious candidates because Andrei Shevchenko is there. </p> <p>The pair formed a formidable striking partnership at Kiev and play together for their country.

Robson complained that Coventry's second goal was offside. </p> <p>Jonathan Greening is set to sign a new contract at Manchester United.

      "bodyText": "The absence of George Graham because of arthritis has not prevented the transfer wheels whirring at White Hart Lane. Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Sergei Rebrov and hope to conclude a \u00a310m deal for the Dynamo Kiev striker. The 25-year-old, scorer of eight goals in 12 Champions League appearances this season, is poised to leave Ukraine, and Spurs' director of football David Pleat said yesterday: \"We do have an interest and we have had talks but nothing has been finalised yet.\" Pleat flew to Kiev for a meeting with Dynamo officials last week and has also spoken with Rebrov's agent. Some reports suggested personal terms of \u00a325,000 a week have been settled. Pleat, though, denied that the player had agreed to move to London. \"It depends on many things,\" he said. Tottenham would have to dig deep to sign Rebrov, with Kiev thought to be demanding \u00a312m, twice Spurs' record fee. A bigger hurdle, however, might be persuading the player to join a club who will not be in Europe next season. Last term he was playing in a Champions League semi-final. The Ukrainian has already been linked with moves to both Milan clubs. Inter were said to see him as a replacement for the injured Ronaldo; their city rivals would be obvious candidates because Andrei Shevchenko is there. The pair formed a formidable striking partnership at Kiev and play together for their country. But Shevchenko dropped what may be a hint that Rebrov has his sights set on the Premiership when he told the latest issue of World Soccer: \"I think he is ready for Italy, or for an English side.\" The Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for comments he made to the referee Neale Barry after his side's 2-1 defeat at Coventry on April 15. Robson complained that Coventry's second goal was offside. Jonathan Greening is set to sign a new contract at Manchester United. Liverpool have announced a new sponsorship deal with Reebok worth \u00a321m over three years. Everton have elevated Michael Dunford from secretary to become their first chief executive. \u0095 The Football Association chairman Geoff Thompson is standing for election to Uefa's executive committee. He is one of 13 candidates vying for seven seats on the decision-making body. England currently has no representative on the committee. Desmond Shanklin, treasurer of the Football Association of Wales, is also standing in the June 30 election.",

But football, like horse racing, athletics and many other sports, is some way ahead of cricket when it comes to investigating skulduggery. Many at the ECB and the ICC have no idea what is going on. And you can bet on that.",

The protesters damaged shops and sprayed graffiti on landmarks including a statue of Winston Churchill and the Cenotaph.</p> <p>Mr Hague said the demonstrators had \"dishonoured our war dead.\" Condemning what he called the government's failure to prevent the \"appalling, disgraceful\" scenes, he challenged Mr Blair to back a call by Steve Norris, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, to ban May Day demonstrations next year.</p> <p>Mr Blair rejected Mr Hague's accusations, and dismissed Mr Norris's \"cod\" election address.

      "bodyText": "As William Hague accused Tony Blair of weakness over law and order at prime minister's questions yesterday, it was clear that party leaders were concentrating on tomorrow's elections across the country. The Conservative leader accused the prime minister of displaying \"wretched weakness\" over the anti-capitalist riots in central London at the weekend. The protesters damaged shops and sprayed graffiti on landmarks including a statue of Winston Churchill and the Cenotaph. Mr Hague said the demonstrators had \"dishonoured our war dead.\" Condemning what he called the government's failure to prevent the \"appalling, disgraceful\" scenes, he challenged Mr Blair to back a call by Steve Norris, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, to ban May Day demonstrations next year. Mr Blair rejected Mr Hague's accusations, and dismissed Mr Norris's \"cod\" election address. He accused the Conservative leader of \"exploiting\" the riots, and insisted the initial low-key policing of the protests had been correct. Mr Hague, again tying the issue of law and order to the London elections, accused the Labour government of \"weakening the fight against crime\", and said \"London needs a mayor who backs the police, not the rioters,\" in a reference to Ken Livingstone, the independent mayoral candidate accused by his rivals of supporting the demonstrators. Mr Blair said that Labour had in fact introduced measures to cut crime, including a \"three strikes and you're out\" policy for burglars. He accused Mr Hague of leaping on any passing bandwagon\" and added: \"Your capacity to exploit any situation is absolutely unlimited.\" Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, also criticised Mr Hague. Referring to an incident in Birmingham this week where a black man was set on fire in racist attack, he accused the Tory leader of \"gutter politics\" for his recent comments on asylum seekers, and said politicians \"should not play or pander to racism\". While Labour and the Conservatives are focusing on the London elections, the Liberal Democrats' hopes are pinned on the Romsey byelection, where they hope to overturn a Tory majority of more than 6,000. Mr Blair followed up the attack on Mr Hague over asylum seekers, saying it was a \"deception\" to suggest that spending on pensions, health and education could be significantly increased by reducing money spent on asylum seekers, which in any case he said only amounted to less than 0.2% of all expenditure. The debate turned directly to the London polls again when the prime minister was asked to say what he would do with his second vote in tomorrow's proportional election for mayor, after he had given his first to the Labour candidate Frank Dobson.

The Fiver certainly didn't, but our mild scoffing was roughly stuffed down our agog throats today when Dynamo Kiev striker Sergei Rebrov revealed his move to Tottenham \"should be signed and sealed\" within the next two weeks.</p> <p>\"They managed to find a common language with me,\" said Rebrov today in Esperanto. \"It's just a matter of whether the two clubs can agree a fee.\" The price is expected to be around \u00a311m, which would eclipse the in-no-way-wasted \u00a36m Spurs paid to a highly-amused Newcastle for Les Ferdinand. \"I am looking forward to playing in England. I like it better than Italian football, although I can't explain why,\" enthused Rebrov, making you wonder - not for the first time - about his judgement.</p> <p>Spurs fans will be delighted enough with this signing, but the fact that their club beat Arsenal in the chase for the 26-year-old should put a north-London cherry on the Ukrainian cake. Arsene Wenger's transfer policy wouldn't stretch to Rebrov's \u00a325,000-per-week contract, and, like another high-profile striker the week before, Highbury saw a coveted player disappear down a less parsimonious road. If Rebrov falls over tomorrow with knee knack, we'll know who's been paying the hitman.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>A FIVER FOR EUROPE</strong></p> <p>Sign up now for the Euro, the Fiver's special Euro 2000 sibling.

Many commentators had expected Patrick Vieira to take Neil Ruddock out with a machine gun, while others thought John Moncur would achieve the unique feat of snapping six ligaments with one challenge. These hopes were false however, and disconsolate punters were left to make do with 10 bookings, one red card, a disputed winner and a shove on the ref.</p> <p>Not that 'Appy 'Arry Redknapp was complaining. Oh, hang on a second, he was. \"My players felt they have been cheated, had been robbed of a result they deserved and I felt the same,\" said the cheeky chirpy cockney in various tenses today, explaining away Marc-Vivien Foe's manhandling of referee Paul Durkin in injury-time. \"There was no fighting in the tunnel, or anything like that,\" 'Arry went on as if scrapping under a roof was somehow worse.</p> <p>The Hammers must wait until the FA read Durkin's match report to find out whether they will become the fifth Premiership club charged with failing to control their players this season. But 'Arry knows his boys were in the right. \"We went to Highbury with a real odds-and-sods team and we deserved to come away with something\", he said today. \"Three of my players were in tears in the dressing room because they were so disappointed. They had a right go.\" And therein, the Fiver would like to venture, lies the problem.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I don't trust you. You did something to us in Marseille. You had a debt the day of the match at the Velodrome Stadium. You were paid off by Marseille\" - The words of Monaco manager Claude Puel, according to his keeper Fabian Barthez. Barthez claims Puel wrongly accused him of taking bribes after he played a stinker in Monaco's 4-2 league defeat by OM. Puel denies the allegations. Now that's psychological warfare.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE WEDNESDAY FLUTTER</strong></p> <p>Imagine Ryan Giggs roller-coasting down the wing, Don Hutchinson and Roy Keane bossing the midfield... and Fulham's Maik Taylor in goal. Are you drooling yet? Well England boss Kelvin Koogan certainly was when TaLk SpoRT asked him to pick a player he would have in his England side from each of the home countries. </p> <p>Now for most of us the answer would be blindingly obvious: \"We'll have Ryan Giggs thank-you-very-much and the rest of you can piddle off\". But not Kelv. Oh no. Just look how deftly he's able to hop, skip and jump over piddling matters like international law, all-known footballing logic and sheer common-sense.</p> <p>HOP! Kelvin shows an ingenious disregard for the 1922 partition of Ireland by picking Roy Keane in his four nations team.</p> <p>SKIP!! The England boss says that the player he most wants to pick for Euro 2000 is not Beckham or Owen but Don Hutchinson. \"It's very difficult to pick him up,\" Koogan reveals. \"He can do the little things and he works at pace too,\" he adds, perhaps telling us more than we need to know. </p> <p>JUMP!!! \"I would take the keeper from Fulham, Maik Taylor, because he's the best taker of a cross I've ever seen in my life,\" explains Koogan, failing to make clear whether Taylor's an astute crucifix-stealing thief, a rival to Beckham down the right-flank or simply a much better player than a Southampton reject is ever entitled to be.</p> <p>At the moment England are 10-1 for Euro 2000. But with Kelv in this kind of form those odds are certain to drop. Get your bets on now.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Spurs want Mark Viduka to partner Sergei Rebrov at White Hart Lane next season. The Scottish player of the year would cost \u00a38.5m, but his agent claims that the Australian international will not be leaving Celtic.</p> <p>Bobby Robson is likely to make a \u00a35m bid for Wimbledon's Jason Euell this summer. He watched the former England Under-21 star in the Dons' defeat against Bradford last weekend.</p> <p>The most famous Iranian footballer in the world could be on his way to Leeds.

Hareide, currently in charge at Danish side Brondby, said: \"I have a contract with Brondby that runs until 2002 - and there will be no breaking that contract.\" </p> <p>Craig Burley and Derby assistant manager Billy McEwan have been charged with disrepute by the FA for comments made to match officials after the Rams' match with West Ham last month. </p> <p>Blackpool boss Steve McMahon is interested in taking over as coach of Australian side South Melbourne. The Age newspaper, based in Melbourne, says agents acting on behalf of the former England midfielder have contacted the club expressing a \"serious\" interest in the vacant post.</p> <p>Tony Vidmar has agreed a one-year extension to his current contract which will tie him to Rangers until 2002.</p> <p>Hearts have secured the longest-running sponsorship deal in Scottish football by extending their contract with Strongbow for a ninth successive year.</p> <p>Ken Friar has stepped down as Arsenal's managing director, to take charge of the club's new stadium plans.

I like it better than Italian football, although I can't explain why,\" enthused Rebrov, making you wonder - not for the first time - about his judgement. Spurs fans will be delighted enough with this signing, but the fact that their club beat Arsenal in the chase for the 26-year-old should put a north-London cherry on the Ukrainian cake. Arsene Wenger's transfer policy wouldn't stretch to Rebrov's \u00a325,000-per-week contract, and, like another high-profile striker the week before, Highbury saw a coveted player disappear down a less parsimonious road. If Rebrov falls over tomorrow with knee knack, we'll know who's been paying the hitman. * * * * * * * * * * * * * A FIVER FOR EUROPE Sign up now for the Euro, the Fiver's special Euro 2000 sibling.

Many commentators had expected Patrick Vieira to take Neil Ruddock out with a machine gun, while others thought John Moncur would achieve the unique feat of snapping six ligaments with one challenge. These hopes were false however, and disconsolate punters were left to make do with 10 bookings, one red card, a disputed winner and a shove on the ref. Not that 'Appy 'Arry Redknapp was complaining. Oh, hang on a second, he was. \"My players felt they have been cheated, had been robbed of a result they deserved and I felt the same,\" said the cheeky chirpy cockney in various tenses today, explaining away Marc-Vivien Foe's manhandling of referee Paul Durkin in injury-time. \"There was no fighting in the tunnel, or anything like that,\" 'Arry went on as if scrapping under a roof was somehow worse. The Hammers must wait until the FA read Durkin's match report to find out whether they will become the fifth Premiership club charged with failing to control their players this season. But 'Arry knows his boys were in the right. \"We went to Highbury with a real odds-and-sods team and we deserved to come away with something\", he said today. \"Three of my players were in tears in the dressing room because they were so disappointed. They had a right go.\" And therein, the Fiver would like to venture, lies the problem. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I don't trust you. You did something to us in Marseille. You had a debt the day of the match at the Velodrome Stadium. You were paid off by Marseille\" - The words of Monaco manager Claude Puel, according to his keeper Fabian Barthez. Barthez claims Puel wrongly accused him of taking bribes after he played a stinker in Monaco's 4-2 league defeat by OM. Puel denies the allegations. Now that's psychological warfare. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE WEDNESDAY FLUTTER Imagine Ryan Giggs roller-coasting down the wing, Don Hutchinson and Roy Keane bossing the midfield... and Fulham's Maik Taylor in goal. Are you drooling yet? Well England boss Kelvin Koogan certainly was when TaLk SpoRT asked him to pick a player he would have in his England side from each of the home countries. Now for most of us the answer would be blindingly obvious: \"We'll have Ryan Giggs thank-you-very-much and the rest of you can piddle off\". But not Kelv. Oh no. Just look how deftly he's able to hop, skip and jump over piddling matters like international law, all-known footballing logic and sheer common-sense. HOP! Kelvin shows an ingenious disregard for the 1922 partition of Ireland by picking Roy Keane in his four nations team. SKIP!! The England boss says that the player he most wants to pick for Euro 2000 is not Beckham or Owen but Don Hutchinson. \"It's very difficult to pick him up,\" Koogan reveals. \"He can do the little things and he works at pace too,\" he adds, perhaps telling us more than we need to know. JUMP!!! \"I would take the keeper from Fulham, Maik Taylor, because he's the best taker of a cross I've ever seen in my life,\" explains Koogan, failing to make clear whether Taylor's an astute crucifix-stealing thief, a rival to Beckham down the right-flank or simply a much better player than a Southampton reject is ever entitled to be. At the moment England are 10-1 for Euro 2000. But with Kelv in this kind of form those odds are certain to drop. Get your bets on now. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Spurs want Mark Viduka to partner Sergei Rebrov at White Hart Lane next season. The Scottish player of the year would cost \u00a38.5m, but his agent claims that the Australian international will not be leaving Celtic. Bobby Robson is likely to make a \u00a35m bid for Wimbledon's Jason Euell this summer. He watched the former England Under-21 star in the Dons' defeat against Bradford last weekend. The most famous Iranian footballer in the world could be on his way to Leeds. Ali Daei, who plays for Hertha Berlin, is likely to leave the club this summer and told the press: \"I know Leeds are interested in me and I see my future as being in England.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Liverpool will not be leaving Anfield in the foreseeable future. Chief executive Rick Parry says the club will extend the capacity of the current stadium to between 60,000 and 70,000 instead. Aage Hareide has ruled himself out of the running to become the new manager of Wimbledon. Hareide, currently in charge at Danish side Brondby, said: \"I have a contract with Brondby that runs until 2002 - and there will be no breaking that contract.\" Craig Burley and Derby assistant manager Billy McEwan have been charged with disrepute by the FA for comments made to match officials after the Rams' match with West Ham last month. Blackpool boss Steve McMahon is interested in taking over as coach of Australian side South Melbourne. The Age newspaper, based in Melbourne, says agents acting on behalf of the former England midfielder have contacted the club expressing a \"serious\" interest in the vacant post. Tony Vidmar has agreed a one-year extension to his current contract which will tie him to Rangers until 2002. Hearts have secured the longest-running sponsorship deal in Scottish football by extending their contract with Strongbow for a ninth successive year. Ken Friar has stepped down as Arsenal's managing director, to take charge of the club's new stadium plans. Keith Edelman will be his replacement. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO BBC1: On Side (11.10pm) Dion Dublin risks his neck by walking down that dodgy-looking ramp.

      "body": "<p>A man who had his face covered in petrol and set alight in a racially-motivated attack was released from hospital in Birmingham yesterday amid warnings that such violence was on the increase.</p> <p>The 24-year-old, who is black, was left with burns to his face and right arm after he was attacked by three men as he walked home in the Northfield area of the city. The man, who has yet to be named, had just dropped off his girlfriend at the city's Royal Orthopaedic hospital. Witnesses told police they were woken by the screams and that one of the attackers had a skinhead haircut.</p> <p>Yesterday Maxi Hayles, of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit (Bramu), blamed the Conservative party's demonising of refugees and minorities in the run-up to this week's local elections for the attack.</p> <p>He said: \"When you have William Hague trumping up emotive language like 'flooding' and 'bogus' it doesn't help. People develop these nationalistic feelings and they think its open season, that they have been given the green light. But things are not looking good for us on this side.\"</p> <p>Mr Hayles was joined by Tony Robson of Searchlight, the anti-fascist magazine, who said: \"There have been more attacks. The hysteria over asylum seekers and refugees has made things worse.\"</p> <p><b> Abuse</b><br></p> <p>Bramu has recorded a 100% increase in the number of reported race-related crimes since last August. It believes the numbers are related to the publication of the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Since August the Bramu caseload has increased from 120 to 240: they believe this is as a result of negative racist feeling stirred up by those opposed to Macpherson.</p> <p>\"We have had a vast increase in racial harassment,\" said Mr Hayles. \"There's a great incidence of violence but most of the cases are to do with racial abuse.\"</p> <p>West Midlands police last night urged caution when interpreting figures. Chief Inspector Paul Diehl said the 50% increase in the reporting of racially-motivated crime was as a result of increased confidence in the police since the Macpherson report's publication.</p> <p>\"These are all serious incidents but the majority are at the lower end of the scale in terms of racial abuse,\" he said. \"What we have seen is an increase in the number of people who feel confident in reporting to us.\"</p> <p>Over the past year there had been 13 race-related violent incidents. One of them had been the attack last March on the boyfriend of the British Olympic gold medal hope Ashia Hansen, who was stabbed by a racist gang. Chris Cotter, 28, who is white, was knifed in the back and face by a gang of up to five men outside the black triple jumper's home. One of the attackers said: \"We warned you not to mix with niggers.\"</p> <p>Ms Hansen, 28, had received a hate letter related to the attack. Written in letters torn from a magazine, it said: \"You were lucky last night. We won't make the same mistake again.\" In the days running up to the attack Mr Cotter had received racially abusive calls on his mobile phone.</p> <p>Organisations such as Searchlight and the Anti-Nazi League have observed a marked increase in rightwing activity in the West Midlands and neighbouring areas.</p> <p>On Easter Sunday 40 members of the National Front marched through Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, not far from Birmingham. They had earlier been banned from marching through Worcester.</p> <p>Campaigners believe some of the attacks could be linked to the presence of such movements. Sunday's attack took place not far from the King's Norton ward being contested by the area's British National Party candidate, Jeff Astbury.</p> <p><b> Posters</b><br></p> <p>At first, King's Norton seems an unlikely place for such a candidate. In most of the streets the bungalows are neat, the lawns manicured and all is in blossom. But the lamp-posts are tied with posters saying: \"Vote British National Party: British freedom, British identity.\"</p> <p>Alongside, Conservative party posters offer a man who boasts: \"Born local. Lives Local. Works local.\" Other truncated posters use the \"born local\" phrase as their theme.</p> <p>It was here, a few years ago, that stickers were found on bus stops warning: \"Niggers Beware! Combat 18 in the area.\" And it is not far from here that Marie (not her real name) lives with her two children.

      "bodyText": "A man who had his face covered in petrol and set alight in a racially-motivated attack was released from hospital in Birmingham yesterday amid warnings that such violence was on the increase. The 24-year-old, who is black, was left with burns to his face and right arm after he was attacked by three men as he walked home in the Northfield area of the city. The man, who has yet to be named, had just dropped off his girlfriend at the city's Royal Orthopaedic hospital. Witnesses told police they were woken by the screams and that one of the attackers had a skinhead haircut. Yesterday Maxi Hayles, of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit (Bramu), blamed the Conservative party's demonising of refugees and minorities in the run-up to this week's local elections for the attack. He said: \"When you have William Hague trumping up emotive language like 'flooding' and 'bogus' it doesn't help. People develop these nationalistic feelings and they think its open season, that they have been given the green light. But things are not looking good for us on this side.\" Mr Hayles was joined by Tony Robson of Searchlight, the anti-fascist magazine, who said: \"There have been more attacks. The hysteria over asylum seekers and refugees has made things worse.\" Abuse Bramu has recorded a 100% increase in the number of reported race-related crimes since last August. It believes the numbers are related to the publication of the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Since August the Bramu caseload has increased from 120 to 240: they believe this is as a result of negative racist feeling stirred up by those opposed to Macpherson. \"We have had a vast increase in racial harassment,\" said Mr Hayles. \"There's a great incidence of violence but most of the cases are to do with racial abuse.\" West Midlands police last night urged caution when interpreting figures. Chief Inspector Paul Diehl said the 50% increase in the reporting of racially-motivated crime was as a result of increased confidence in the police since the Macpherson report's publication. \"These are all serious incidents but the majority are at the lower end of the scale in terms of racial abuse,\" he said. \"What we have seen is an increase in the number of people who feel confident in reporting to us.\" Over the past year there had been 13 race-related violent incidents. One of them had been the attack last March on the boyfriend of the British Olympic gold medal hope Ashia Hansen, who was stabbed by a racist gang. Chris Cotter, 28, who is white, was knifed in the back and face by a gang of up to five men outside the black triple jumper's home. One of the attackers said: \"We warned you not to mix with niggers.\" Ms Hansen, 28, had received a hate letter related to the attack. Written in letters torn from a magazine, it said: \"You were lucky last night. We won't make the same mistake again.\" In the days running up to the attack Mr Cotter had received racially abusive calls on his mobile phone. Organisations such as Searchlight and the Anti-Nazi League have observed a marked increase in rightwing activity in the West Midlands and neighbouring areas. On Easter Sunday 40 members of the National Front marched through Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, not far from Birmingham. They had earlier been banned from marching through Worcester. Campaigners believe some of the attacks could be linked to the presence of such movements. Sunday's attack took place not far from the King's Norton ward being contested by the area's British National Party candidate, Jeff Astbury. Posters At first, King's Norton seems an unlikely place for such a candidate. In most of the streets the bungalows are neat, the lawns manicured and all is in blossom. But the lamp-posts are tied with posters saying: \"Vote British National Party: British freedom, British identity.\" Alongside, Conservative party posters offer a man who boasts: \"Born local. Lives Local. Works local.\" Other truncated posters use the \"born local\" phrase as their theme. It was here, a few years ago, that stickers were found on bus stops warning: \"Niggers Beware! Combat 18 in the area.\" And it is not far from here that Marie (not her real name) lives with her two children. Aged nine and seven, they are not allowed to go out because their mother - who is eight and half months pregnant - is too scared to let them. \"I have had my tyres slashed. I have had paint on my car. My little girl had her mouth cut open from a little boy outside. She had her bike tyres cut by a little boy with a knife,\" she said. \"I just keep them inside now. They have been called racial names - just common names like nigger. I have had rubbish through my letterbox and dog mess around my door. It's depressing really.\" Sometimes Marie gets in the car and takes her kids for a \"go on the swings\". Yesterday, in the King's Norton park, one nine-year-old girl from a mixed-race family was blithely swinging through the air. On a bench her babysitter, who was white, said the girl \"gets the usual abuse\". \"She doesn't seem to get it as bad because she's dark and doesn't look as mixed race as the other mixed-race kids,\" she said. \"They call her blackie and stuff like that.\" Catalogue of Hate May 1999 A 53-year-old man is beaten up in a Birmingham park by a young man who asked him: \"Are you a Jew?\" June 1999 Two Birmingham youths who took part in a racist attack on an Asian shopkeeper and his family are sentenced to nine months in custody September 1999 A man is jailed for 12 months after hurling racial abuse during an attack on an Asian shopkeeper in Brownsover, Warwickshire October 1999 A Sutton Coldfield man admits a racist attack on an Asian brother and sister as they walked through the town centre.

But the large majority of the audience who supported the motion when asked to vote before the debate, was reduced after the arguments were heard.

      "body": "<p><strong> Camille San Lazarro</strong> Lecturer, paediatric forensic medicine, Newcastle University </p> <p> First, know it isn't personal: this baby isn't crying because of your parenting. Once you believe that, it's easier to deal with it without hurting him. Check he isn't hungry, wet or uncomfortable; if not, put him down in a safe place and go out of the room. My best tip is to do some vacuuming: this creates what we call a \"white noise\" - in other words, one that won't disturb your baby - and it also drowns out the sound of his cries. You'll be able to do something positive with your time and that will expend some of the negativity you're feeling. When you turn the vacuum cleaner off you'll feel better, and the chances are that the continuous droning will have lulled him to sleep.<br>Verdict: Vacuuming</p> <p><strong> Julie Shemield</strong> Mother of two, Cry-sis helpline volunteer </p> <p> My two children both seemed to cry all the time and it's hell on earth. There is no magic answer, but there are certain things you can experiment with. For example, try tilting the cot so that the baby sleeps with his head higher than his feet; winding the baby as often as possible while you are feeding him; or changing the type of teat you're using if your baby is bottle-fed. But perhaps the best tip I can offer is to believe that it isn't going to last: it feels like it's forever, but it will stop. And you will enjoy being a mother when they're older - I really wasn't happy as the mother of babies, but as they got older life just got better and better.<br>Verdict: Look to the future</p> <p><strong> Eileen Hayes</strong> Author of Crying, published by Pan at \u00a35.99 </p> <p>Soldiering on alone is a bad idea, because eventually you'll snap - anyone would. Listen to the advice you're given and try possible solutions, but bear in mind that different things work for different babies: try to tune in to yours to find out what kind of baby she is, and what she'd like. It might help you to know that research shows that the peak time for crying is six weeks, and that crying always improves after three months; so even if your baby is still crying a lot, she won't be crying as much after that. Also, studies show some babies are just cryers - it's not that they're \"bad\" or \"difficult\". Don't feel a failure because your baby is crying a lot, and don't try to go it alone.<br>Verdict: Get help early on</p> <p><strong> Melanie Every</strong> spokeswoman, Royal College of Midwives </p> <p> If you feel you're getting near breaking point, you have to get out of the room: just put the baby down somewhere safe, and walk away for a while. You've got to put some space between yourself and that intense crying. Baby-shaking doesn't usually happen out of the blue - there's almost always a build-up, and the important thing is to recognise when things are getting too much. Don't be ashamed of admitting that and talk to your midwife, health visitor or GP about it. You needn't be worried that they'll try to take the baby away from you: what all these professionals want to do is support you within your family - not break the family up.<br>Verdict: See a professional</p> <p><strong> John Cameron</strong> counsellor, NSPCC telephone helpline </p> <p> Call a helpline - we're here, even at 3am. When I get someone on the line in a terrible state with a baby crying in the background, the first thing I get them to do is talk about themselves. Sometimes the reason they're near breaking point is to do with something else going on in their life. Then I move on to the crying and try to suggest strategies relevant to the baby's age and circumstances. If a parent says they've shaken their baby, once I've established that the baby isn't in need of urgent medical treatment, I talk to them about what that can do: you can cause brain damage and even death. I don't believe any parent wants to do that to their child, and I'd try to give them the support they needed not to do it again.<br>Verdict: Call a helpline</p> <p><strong> Mark Moorhead</strong> Father of Christian, six, Joseph, four, Madeline, 11 months </p> <p> Both our boys had terrible colic from around three weeks to 12 weeks - they'd cry for two hours every evening. It was horrendous; you'd try everything you could think of, and they just went on and on and on screaming. With Christian, we tended to stay all together in the same room in an attempt to give one another moral support, but with Joseph we tried looking after him in shifts, which worked better. One of us would hold him for 20 minutes or so while the other went upstairs or outside to cool off, then we'd swap over. It felt like it was going to last forever at the time, but one night, as if by magic, it stopped - and Madeline didn't behave in the same way at all.<br>Verdict: Take it in shifts</p>",

      "body": "<p>Two months ago, my sister and I acquired a new brother. He is 36 and, up until the moment he arrived in our lives, my sister and I had assumed we were our mother's only children. </p> <p>I arrived at my mother's flat one evening to find her looking anxious. \"I've had some extraordinary news,\" she said. A pause. \"I'm just going to have to come out and say it.\" Another pause, during which I silently pleaded that there hadn't been a sudden death. My mother drew breath: \"When I was 16, Brendan [her former boyfriend, now a family friend] and I had a baby boy. I gave him up for adoption and now he's written to Brendan.\" </p> <p>My first reaction? Relief that it wasn't bad news - and excitement. \"Oh, my God,\" I said. \"That's amazing. It's like in a film.\" Then: \"You're a dark horse.\" (From her home in Australia, my sister used almost exactly the same words when she heard the news.) </p> <p>It must be rare for very young parents who gave away an unplanned baby still to be in touch 36 years later, but Brendan and my mother remain good friends. My sister and I used to play with his daughters when we were children and he is my sister's godfather. It also defies the odds that my mum, Brendan and their son have ended up living in the same city - a city in which none of them grew up. </p> <p>Later that night, my mother handed me the letter. It was calm, honest and gently informative: \"My name is Tim Cumming. I was born in 1963 and adopted early in 1964. When I was 16, my father gave me my original birth certificate. I was christened Brendan Robert Quinn and I'm one of a family of four adopted children. Last week, I received my adoption records from Father Hudson's in Coleshill and . . . learned about my origins and the circumstances of my birth.\" </p> <p>He wrote about his life, his adoptive parents, his wife and baby girl, what little he knew of his origins and what had led him to trace his birth parents. \"After Natasha [his daughter] was born, and seeing her through her first months of life was so amazing, I found myself thinking more and more about my own birth.\" </p> <p>He wrote that he had been given two letters my mother had written to the nuns where he was born and that \"her handwriting is cranky like mine\". At the end of the typed letter there was a sample of his own handwriting and it did look remarkably like my mother's - and my own. </p> <p>On reading his words, I instantly felt a connection to him - we all did. The letter also made me cry. Tim could not have had any idea what kind of response he would get; when he wrote the letter now in my mother's hand, he didn't even know whether she was alive. </p> <p>I also felt sad that my mother had worried about her lost son all these years and that my sister and I, now 27 and 25, had never been able to comfort her. She says now that she didn't tell us (or anyone other than my father) about her first child partly because there had never been a right time, but mainly because she had completely \"buried\" the memory. So much so that when Tim's letter arrived she was momentarily confused, thinking, \"How can this be from him? Babies can't write letters.\" Yet she also says that the lottery numbers she used every week combined all three of her children's birthdays. Buried, yet not really forgotten. </p> <p>There was no question of me disapproving of what my mum had done. If I had got pregnant at 16, I wouldn't have thought twice about having a termination but abortion was illegal in 1963 and my mother's family were practising Roman Catholics. The eldest of six children, she was doing A levels and planned to go to university. I have no doubt that she did what was best for all involved. </p> <p>I urged Mum to call Tim that night and they arranged to meet the following weekend. They met in a cafe, drank wine, spent seven hours trying to fill in all the gaps. Tim has since described to me, via email, his first glimpse of mum: \"I remember walking up the stairs . . . and your mum was sitting there. I knew it was her and sort of laughed, and it was just great to be alive.\" </p> <p>There had been no problem recognising each other since they looked so much alike. A few days after their reunion, I contacted Tim myself by email. \"Although up until last week, I had no idea you existed,\" I began \"I am thrilled, now, that you have found us. I only wish you hadn't left it so long.\" I told him a bit about myself and added: \"I'm very excited/nervous about meeting you.\" </p> <p>I was on alien territory here. We were, after all, technically strangers and one isn't naturally equipped to deal with new brothers appearing out of the blue. I had to remind myself that Tim was also meeting other new relations and that there was his adoptive family to consider, not to mention his wife and baby. </p> <p>On the surface, I don't feel jealous or threatened by his arrival, but there have been a few visceral pangs. At first, I felt put out that Tim had given my mum her first grandchild. I felt uneasy, too, when I first saw how like my mother and my sister he looks. I am fair, like my father, and take after his family; my sister is brown-haired, as is my mother, and much more like her in ways that I'm not. And here was Tim, another brown-haired child. I was afraid the three of them would form a cosy little gang and I would feel left out. </p> <p>Despite his very recent arrival, I also feel twinges of possessiveness towards Tim. For instance, I try to reassure myself that he'll be closer to me and my sister than to Brendan's daughters (we are his mother's children, after all). And occasionally subconscious feelings surface. A week after Tim appeared, a friend of my mother's told me mum was worried about how I was coping. I confronted her: \"Mum, I'm completely fine about Tim . . . \" </p> <p>\"But,\" she interrupted, \"the first thing you said to me after I'd met Tim was: 'Do you still love me?'.\" I had no idea I'd said it. I had arrived home drunk after a night out with friends and had just made lots of jokes, or so I had thought. </p> <p>Two weeks after my mother and Tim met, I went with her to visit him at his home. I stood on the doorstep, clutching a bunch of tulips and a bottle of champagne, half wanting to turn around and run. </p> <p>Inside, we were all nervous and unable to focus on details (Tim had to open the baby gate every time I needed to go to the loo) but, considering the circumstances, the meeting was remarkably relaxed. </p> <p>The second time the three of us met, I found it frustrating. Tim and my mother were caught up in learning about each other and going over ancient family history, and I suddenly just wanted to go out and \"play\" with my new big brother. I wanted him to be a kid with me rather than one of the grown-ups. </p> <p>We met up alone one evening, drank lots of red wine over dinner and, although nervous, were able to talk honestly about our lives and feelings. There was a sense that if this new acquaintance was going to be a close relation, we may as well begin by showing our true colours. Even when you are strangers, sharing a mother creates a link that can become a bond.</p>",

A few days after their reunion, I contacted Tim myself by email. \"Although up until last week, I had no idea you existed,\" I began \"I am thrilled, now, that you have found us. I only wish you hadn't left it so long.\" I told him a bit about myself and added: \"I'm very excited/nervous about meeting you.\" I was on alien territory here. We were, after all, technically strangers and one isn't naturally equipped to deal with new brothers appearing out of the blue. I had to remind myself that Tim was also meeting other new relations and that there was his adoptive family to consider, not to mention his wife and baby. On the surface, I don't feel jealous or threatened by his arrival, but there have been a few visceral pangs. At first, I felt put out that Tim had given my mum her first grandchild. I felt uneasy, too, when I first saw how like my mother and my sister he looks. I am fair, like my father, and take after his family; my sister is brown-haired, as is my mother, and much more like her in ways that I'm not. And here was Tim, another brown-haired child. I was afraid the three of them would form a cosy little gang and I would feel left out. Despite his very recent arrival, I also feel twinges of possessiveness towards Tim. For instance, I try to reassure myself that he'll be closer to me and my sister than to Brendan's daughters (we are his mother's children, after all). And occasionally subconscious feelings surface. A week after Tim appeared, a friend of my mother's told me mum was worried about how I was coping. I confronted her: \"Mum, I'm completely fine about Tim . . . \" \"But,\" she interrupted, \"the first thing you said to me after I'd met Tim was: 'Do you still love me?'.\" I had no idea I'd said it. I had arrived home drunk after a night out with friends and had just made lots of jokes, or so I had thought. Two weeks after my mother and Tim met, I went with her to visit him at his home. I stood on the doorstep, clutching a bunch of tulips and a bottle of champagne, half wanting to turn around and run. Inside, we were all nervous and unable to focus on details (Tim had to open the baby gate every time I needed to go to the loo) but, considering the circumstances, the meeting was remarkably relaxed. The second time the three of us met, I found it frustrating. Tim and my mother were caught up in learning about each other and going over ancient family history, and I suddenly just wanted to go out and \"play\" with my new big brother. I wanted him to be a kid with me rather than one of the grown-ups. We met up alone one evening, drank lots of red wine over dinner and, although nervous, were able to talk honestly about our lives and feelings. There was a sense that if this new acquaintance was going to be a close relation, we may as well begin by showing our true colours. Even when you are strangers, sharing a mother creates a link that can become a bond.",

      "body": "<p>The Home Office is far from happy about new-labour.com. The spoof internet site is dedicated to one thing the government isn't keen to shout about - the most significant change in terrorist law in history. </p> <p>It is redefining \"terrorism\" so that it will put people who, for example, dig up genetically modified crops in the same frame as an IRA bomber, by introducing the concept that property damage is such an act. It would mean someone who commits a crime for ideological reasons would have less rights on arrest than someone who commits a crime for profit and greed. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, voted against the prevention of terrorism bill which set up emergency provisions for Northern Ireland in 1974. Scheduled to last six months, they have endured a quarter of a century. Now they are to be broadened and brought wholesale into UK legislation permanently. </p> <p>At the heart of the bill, introduced on December 2 last year, is the new definition, copied verbatim from the FBI. The bill defines terrorism as follows: \"The use of serious violence against persons or property, or the threat to use such violence, to intimidate or coerce a government, the public, or any section of the public for political, religious or ideological ends.\" </p> <p>Labour MP Alan Simpson says: \"We are witnessing a global resurgence of citizens movements, saying, 'If governments can no longer protect our rights, we shall have to do so ourselves.' It's sad that we've chosen this moment to redefine terrorism. Potentially, it turns activist movements into terrorist movements. It's a catch-all bill that will net, if not all the members of the house, some fairly prominent members of it.\" </p> <p>MPs went ahead and voted themselves terrorists anyway, passing the bill by 210 votes to one in March. The debate saw cross-party harmony between a few MPs, but it was only Labour backbencher Paul Flynn who voted against. Conservative MP Douglas Hogg was apopleptic of his dislike of hunt saboteurs, but he insisted: \"They are not in any ordinary sense terrorists.\" The bill is due to go through the committee stages of the Lords this month, and is likely to be law by summer. </p> <p>\"The act is an attempt to silence all opposition to the rule of profit over people by labelling it terrorist,\" says a newly-formed group, Prevent the Terrorism Act (PTA), set up in Brighton, East Sussex. \"You only have to look at how the stalking laws were used. The protection from harassment bill was designed to protect women from being stalked. Surprise, surprise, the very first people to be prosecuted under the act were animal rights activists\". </p> <p>So who could be affected? If the proposed new powers had been in place over the last 20 years, they could have been enacted against those who campaigned against the poll tax, the miners' strike and apartheid. The law makes it an offence to support, by word or deed, an armed struggle in another country. Supporting Nelson Mandela would have been illegal. </p> <p>Translate that to today and watch out if you are a supporter of the Ogonis in Nigeria, Amazonian Indians, Kurds, the Tamil Tigers, Burmese activists or Tibetan freedom fighters. </p> <p>A statement by the civil rights lobby group, Liberty, says: \"There is a real danger that refugees and others who have fled repressive regimes to the safety of this country will become a legitimate target of the police merely because they support the overthrow of that regime, even if they themselves are opposed to violence.\" </p> <p>At the sharp end in domestic issues are animal rights activists. Clause 3 of the bill allows for proscription, or banning, of organisations such as the Animal Liberation Front. But some are not fazed by this. \"It doesn't really matter what the law is, it is what they do behind your back, whether it's the police, Arni [the Animal Rights National Index police database] or Special Branch,\" says one animal rights activist, who didn't want to be named. \"I've been obviously followed by cars but whether it's blatant or they are thick I'm not sure. We recovered a tracking device from one of our vehicles.\" </p> <p>The most likely effect of widening the legislation and bringing it over to the mainland permanently will be for information gathering and harassment, say campaigners. </p> <p>In 1985, the Tory home secretary, Leon Brittan, admitted that the law was used to \"gain information through questioning people. The vast majority of those questioned under the act did not have access to legal representation.\" Paul Hill, one of the Guildford Four, was the first man to be arrested under the 1974 terrorism laws. He was wrongly jailed for 15 years. </p> <p>In December last year, the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland found six instances where the new bill contravenes the incoming Human Rights Act. There are bound to be a raft of cases, despite Home Office insistance that the bill complies. </p> <p>\"It is particularly galling for Greenpeace to be labelled terrorists,\" says spokesman Jim Thomas. \"We have been at the end of real terrorist activity - the blowing up of the Rainbow Warrior. The real terrorists are companies which release long-term damaging crops into the environment without choice.\" </p> <p>Domestic terrorism laws in place for years in Italy have led to \"eco-terrorism\" being common currency in the tabloids. \"People are scared of us, \" says one, \"People now think of us as terrorists. It's too late in Italy.\" </p> <p>Luke Anderson, an activisit against GM foods, says: \"The government is creating a private security service for transnational corporations.\" As a prominent campaigner, he is aware that, under Clause 54 of the bill, if someone is \"directing at any level\" a group of people who commit a terrorist act they would face life imprisonment. Although it is extremely unlikely he would ever face such a charge, the fact that it will exist on the statute book is a pointer to the future. </p> <p>Journalists reporting on direct action could be caught by Clause 18, which carries a five-year sentence for failure to report information, received professionally, which may lead to a terrorist act. </p> <p>A glimpse of government complacency came during the committee stages in the Commons. Home Office minister, Charles Clarke, championed as a rising star of the Blair government, when justifying the 28-day authorisation period for stop-and-search zones in which terrorist activity is suspected, casually remarked that it is because \"it is one of my favourite numbers\". </p> <p>Neither Clarke nor Jack Straw, could allay the charge that the bill paints with a brush far too wide.</p>",

It's a catch-all bill that will net, if not all the members of the house, some fairly prominent members of it.\" MPs went ahead and voted themselves terrorists anyway, passing the bill by 210 votes to one in March. The debate saw cross-party harmony between a few MPs, but it was only Labour backbencher Paul Flynn who voted against. Conservative MP Douglas Hogg was apopleptic of his dislike of hunt saboteurs, but he insisted: \"They are not in any ordinary sense terrorists.\" The bill is due to go through the committee stages of the Lords this month, and is likely to be law by summer. \"The act is an attempt to silence all opposition to the rule of profit over people by labelling it terrorist,\" says a newly-formed group, Prevent the Terrorism Act (PTA), set up in Brighton, East Sussex. \"You only have to look at how the stalking laws were used. The protection from harassment bill was designed to protect women from being stalked. Surprise, surprise, the very first people to be prosecuted under the act were animal rights activists\". So who could be affected? If the proposed new powers had been in place over the last 20 years, they could have been enacted against those who campaigned against the poll tax, the miners' strike and apartheid. The law makes it an offence to support, by word or deed, an armed struggle in another country. Supporting Nelson Mandela would have been illegal. Translate that to today and watch out if you are a supporter of the Ogonis in Nigeria, Amazonian Indians, Kurds, the Tamil Tigers, Burmese activists or Tibetan freedom fighters. A statement by the civil rights lobby group, Liberty, says: \"There is a real danger that refugees and others who have fled repressive regimes to the safety of this country will become a legitimate target of the police merely because they support the overthrow of that regime, even if they themselves are opposed to violence.\" At the sharp end in domestic issues are animal rights activists. Clause 3 of the bill allows for proscription, or banning, of organisations such as the Animal Liberation Front. But some are not fazed by this. \"It doesn't really matter what the law is, it is what they do behind your back, whether it's the police, Arni [the Animal Rights National Index police database] or Special Branch,\" says one animal rights activist, who didn't want to be named. \"I've been obviously followed by cars but whether it's blatant or they are thick I'm not sure. We recovered a tracking device from one of our vehicles.\" The most likely effect of widening the legislation and bringing it over to the mainland permanently will be for information gathering and harassment, say campaigners. In 1985, the Tory home secretary, Leon Brittan, admitted that the law was used to \"gain information through questioning people. The vast majority of those questioned under the act did not have access to legal representation.\" Paul Hill, one of the Guildford Four, was the first man to be arrested under the 1974 terrorism laws. He was wrongly jailed for 15 years. In December last year, the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland found six instances where the new bill contravenes the incoming Human Rights Act. There are bound to be a raft of cases, despite Home Office insistance that the bill complies. \"It is particularly galling for Greenpeace to be labelled terrorists,\" says spokesman Jim Thomas. \"We have been at the end of real terrorist activity - the blowing up of the Rainbow Warrior. The real terrorists are companies which release long-term damaging crops into the environment without choice.\" Domestic terrorism laws in place for years in Italy have led to \"eco-terrorism\" being common currency in the tabloids. \"People are scared of us, \" says one, \"People now think of us as terrorists. It's too late in Italy.\" Luke Anderson, an activisit against GM foods, says: \"The government is creating a private security service for transnational corporations.\" As a prominent campaigner, he is aware that, under Clause 54 of the bill, if someone is \"directing at any level\" a group of people who commit a terrorist act they would face life imprisonment. Although it is extremely unlikely he would ever face such a charge, the fact that it will exist on the statute book is a pointer to the future. Journalists reporting on direct action could be caught by Clause 18, which carries a five-year sentence for failure to report information, received professionally, which may lead to a terrorist act. A glimpse of government complacency came during the committee stages in the Commons. Home Office minister, Charles Clarke, championed as a rising star of the Blair government, when justifying the 28-day authorisation period for stop-and-search zones in which terrorist activity is suspected, casually remarked that it is because \"it is one of my favourite numbers\". Neither Clarke nor Jack Straw, could allay the charge that the bill paints with a brush far too wide.",

Traffic grew by 12%, twice the national average, in the 10 years after 1988. A hundred thousand commuters flock to the centre every morning, often from affluent suburbs outside the city boundaries, while inside a city with pockets of severe poverty, half the households don't have a car. </p> <p>Taxing workplace parking will make money available for egalitarian public transport - \u00a34m in the first year, the council calculates. And it won't deter the two million regular shoppers who finance the thriving city centre, as indiscriminate taxing for road use might have done, the council says. </p> <p>In his wood-panelled office overlooking the pedestrianised city centre, the council leader, Graham Chapman, is unmoved by protests. \"Business has a public and a private face, and the private face is very sanguine and sensible,\" he says. \"I'm finding that the firms who think two years ahead don't like it. The ones who think 10 years ahead are fairly in favour.\" </p> <p>The more sanguine side of business is represented at Nottingham's commuter planners club, set up by the council five years ago. All of the city's large employers are represented, and many encourage staff to walk, cycle or go by bus. These are the organisations that will bear the brunt of the new tax, since small businesses will be exempt. Boots, which has its headquarters in Nottingham, runs 60 staff buses, a car sharing pool and cycle facilities, at an annual cost of \u00a3350,000. </p> <p>The company opposes a tax on its 5,000 parking spaces, although the council plans to discount existing \"green travel\" expenditure. \"It's an ill-conceived idea, a tax on coming to work,\" says a Boots spokesman. \"We accept that it's more than likely to happen, but the local authority needs to work very closely with employers.\" Boots will pass on the cost to its employees. Others are undecided. There are many more rumblings in the commuter planners club. </p> <p>If staff pay, how will it affect the lower paid workers? Will it discriminate against women with children? Some even fear that companies will move out, or that charging will deter newcomers.\"It could tip the balance between being in or out of town,\" says Nick Ebbs, a commercial property consultant. \"In the long term if the strategy works and you have invested in public transport the city is a more attractive proposition. But there is going to be some serious pain in the short term.\" </p> <p>These are issues that inflame Chapman, a bus passenger since his \"grotty old Montego\" caught fire. An initial annual charge of \u00a3170 for each parking place is unlikely to cause mass migration of city companies, he says. Neither will employees start job searching over a daily parking charge of 70p. All the money raised will be ring-fenced for public transport, and the council will lure commuters with a supertram, more bus lanes, electric shuttle buses and suburban rail lines. Chapman has sympathy, however, for companies who fear the tax will cause an administrative burden. The city has set up a partnership with employers to examine all aspects of implementation. </p> <p>The government wants public transport to be improved before charging starts. Participating councils have been given extra cash, \u00a31.2m in Nottingham's case, to start the process. The council wants companies to try electronic barriers linked to smart cards that could be used for parking or public transport. </p> <p>Chapman isn't too angry that the government has passed on its problems. For the first time in his political life he has more cash than he asked for - and expects more. </p> <p>\"In an ideal world, I would have preferred it to be done by central government,\" he says. \"We know it's not going to be electorally popular, but I'm absolutely convinced that eventually people will understand it.\" </p> <p>Bold words for a councillor with local elections looming. The government is unlikely to be as brave.</p>",

The company opposes a tax on its 5,000 parking spaces, although the council plans to discount existing \"green travel\" expenditure. \"It's an ill-conceived idea, a tax on coming to work,\" says a Boots spokesman. \"We accept that it's more than likely to happen, but the local authority needs to work very closely with employers.\" Boots will pass on the cost to its employees. Others are undecided. There are many more rumblings in the commuter planners club. If staff pay, how will it affect the lower paid workers? Will it discriminate against women with children? Some even fear that companies will move out, or that charging will deter newcomers.\"It could tip the balance between being in or out of town,\" says Nick Ebbs, a commercial property consultant. \"In the long term if the strategy works and you have invested in public transport the city is a more attractive proposition. But there is going to be some serious pain in the short term.\" These are issues that inflame Chapman, a bus passenger since his \"grotty old Montego\" caught fire. An initial annual charge of \u00a3170 for each parking place is unlikely to cause mass migration of city companies, he says. Neither will employees start job searching over a daily parking charge of 70p. All the money raised will be ring-fenced for public transport, and the council will lure commuters with a supertram, more bus lanes, electric shuttle buses and suburban rail lines. Chapman has sympathy, however, for companies who fear the tax will cause an administrative burden. The city has set up a partnership with employers to examine all aspects of implementation. The government wants public transport to be improved before charging starts. Participating councils have been given extra cash, \u00a31.2m in Nottingham's case, to start the process. The council wants companies to try electronic barriers linked to smart cards that could be used for parking or public transport. Chapman isn't too angry that the government has passed on its problems. For the first time in his political life he has more cash than he asked for - and expects more. \"In an ideal world, I would have preferred it to be done by central government,\" he says. \"We know it's not going to be electorally popular, but I'm absolutely convinced that eventually people will understand it.\" Bold words for a councillor with local elections looming. The government is unlikely to be as brave.",

      "body": "<p>A group of adopters and foster carers are exchanging views and experiences. Their conversation ranges from the strains of coping with very challenging behaviour through to the pleasures of watching a child succeed for the first time. They laugh, they groan, they sympathise and encourage. There is no mistaking the enormous level of commitment they all feel towards the children in their care. Each member of the group also happens to be gay or lesbian. </p> <p>According to the tabloid press, these are the two-headed monsters who will corrupt and deprave vulnerable children. Flak from politicians, church leaders and the media has made many adoption and fostering agencies reluctant to publicise their willingness to recruit lesbians and gay men - at a time when there is a dire shortage of people willing or able to take on the complex needs of children in public care. </p> <p>Anyone reading certain newspaper reports in the run-up to last week's \"adoption summit\" at Downing Street, could be forgiven for thinking that adoption by gay men and lesbians was high on the political agenda. Headlines in the Sunday Times announcing \"Blair to let gay couples adopt\" and the Sunday Express's story \"Blair ready to lift the ban on gay adoption\" suggested a major shake-up in adoption practice. However, no specific mention of gay adopters was made by the health minister, John Hutton, in his statement following the summit meeting of key representatives from the adoption field. </p> <p>Like many reports of adoption issues, this story was a red herring. Under current legislation, gay people can adopt. But like any unmarried couple - heterosexual or gay - only one partner can legally become the adopter (with the partner being carefully assessed in the adoption procedure). And while it is true that very few gay and lesbian people are currently adopters, the prime minister would be hard-pressed to find any local authority which actively \"bans\" gay and lesbian carers. The reasons why gay men and lesbians fail to become adopters - or indeed foster carers - are far more subtle. </p> <p>Helen Cosis Brown, director of postgraduate diplomas in social work at South Bank University, London, specialises in foster care and issues around sexuality. She says: \"We have a real crisis in not having enough good quality carers. The types of people who are able to manage these children's needs are going to be extraordinary people, so we need to look at every individual who has the capacity to do this.\" </p> <p>Cosis Brown says that studies in England and the US have shown that there is no difference in emotional development, relationships with peers or sexual orientation between children who grow up in heterosexual or homosexual households. She plans to research outcomes for children who are placed from the care system, and to examine the way agencies utilise gay and lesbian carers. </p> <p>\"My feeling is that only a tiny minority of adoption and fostering agencies would refuse to assess lesbians or gay men, but the ways people fail to get through the process are likely to be more subtle,\" says Cosis Brown. \"I think this is because of the anxieties homosexuality provokes in some people. </p> <p>\"Assessment processes get skewed because the social worker is either over-focusing on sexuality or ignoring it all together through embarrassment. But you can't ignore it because someone's homosexuality impacts on their life as a carer. You need to establish whether they can manage homophobia constructively. Responding angrily may be fine if it's just you - but as a foster carer you often have to put the child's needs before your own.\" </p> <p>Dr Stephen Hicks is co-editor of the book Lesbian and Gay Fostering and Adoption: Extraordinary Yet Ordinary. He has also carried out research into the attitudes of social workers and found that they were often concerned about whether gay men and lesbians could act as role models. </p> <p>\"They wanted to know whether lesbians were anti-men or whether gay men could be considered as a role models of masculinity,\" he says. \"I did find that social workers were less inclined to place under-11s because they felt younger children might be 'influenced'. I also got some social workers saying it was OK to place disabled children with gay men and lesbians because they 'wouldn't understand'.\" </p> <p>Social workers were also concerned about whether they would be able to get gay men or lesbians approved by their adoption or fostering panels - the body of people who make the decisions about whether individuals are suitable. </p> <p>The composition of these panels means that elected members or representatives from outside organisations may have strong political or religious views which could conflict with the local authority or voluntary agencies' own equal opportunities policies. </p> <p>\"Even when panels are trying to be liberal, you come across some strange things - like them asking which one of a gay couple is maternal and which one is paternal,\" says Hicks. \"One panel even asked whether a gay couple would be able to do the laundry. </p> <p>\"Nobody is claiming that all gay men and lesbians are going to make wonderful carers, but there are some very gifted lesbian and gay carers around. They are usually people who have had to fight to get to the point of being assessed. When agencies are struggling to find carers, it's madness to reject people simply on grounds of their sexuality.\" </p> <p>Richard and Paul (not their real names) are a couple in their 50s and have been together for 28 years. Despite Richard's extensive experience as a children's social worker, they found it very difficult to find an agency prepared to place a child with them. Through an extremely tortuous route, they became long-term foster carers for Patrick, a disturbed and angry 10 year old. </p> <p>Now aged 14, Patrick has benefited greatly from the stability Richard and Paul provide. The couple both come from close-knit families and Patrick enjoys having grandparents and aunts and uncles. </p> <p>\"We have been able to offer him a great deal of commitment, love and devotion,\" says Richard. \"He had a lack of belief in himself and saw himself as a bad person. He has gradually learned that he is worthwhile and lovable and he is much more hopeful about the future. He's our only child and he's extremely special. He really needed to be special to someone.\" </p> <p> Richard is a founding member of the Lesbian and Gay Foster and Adoptive Parents' Network. He says that several members of the group have experienced harassment because of negative stories in the press, and he believes that many local authorities are cautious about recruiting gay and lesbian carers because of possible reactions from local councillors and the media. The Children's Society certainly received media criticism when it announced last year that it was dropping its ban on gay and lesbian carers. </p> <p>For those charities who have adoption and fostering projects, there is always the fine balance between meeting children's needs and keeping donors and trustees happy - especially when the charity has strong links with major religious organisations. </p> <p>Barnardo's recently changed its policy to be more welcoming towards gay people. \"In the past, we would take up gay and lesbian applicants but their approval had to go through an extra level of senior management,\" explains Anne van Meeuwen, Barnardo's principal policy officer. </p> <p>\"Now we have become more child-centred. We recognise there are people in a range of family structures who have something very positive to offer to children with challenging backgrounds. We owe it to children to consider every possibility. For example, some sexually abused girls will feel most safe when placed with lesbian carers.\" </p> <p>The Albert Kennedy Trust was set up to offer support and accommodation to homeless gay, lesbian and bisexual teenagers. It recruits and trains gay, lesbian and bisexual carers who offer placement for young people aged 16 and over. Some local authorities also approach the trust to find carers for younger children. </p> <p>\"We are very strict about who we approve,\" explains Sean Galligan, chair of the trust, who is also a carer. </p> <p>\"A lot of the young people are quite damaged. They often have families who are physically or emotionally abusing them, and they may have been attacked at school or had prejudiced social workers. We are looking to match young people with someone they can positively identify with who can help them sort out problems in all areas of their lives. </p> <p>\"Gay men and lesbians have a lot to give. Just because some of us don't have our own children doesn't mean we don't want to nurture the society we live in.\"</p> <p><strong>Unclear case of prejudice</strong></p> <p>Claire and Yasmin (not their real names) are the adopters of two girls, aged four and 12. They both have extensive experience of working with children. They were the first lesbian couple to be approved as adopters by their local authority, but it took a long time - and many false starts - before their first child was placed. </p> <p>\"Yasmin is Asian so we were approved for a mixed race child - but then it was an issue of finding that child,\" Claire explains. \"Adoption agencies tend to place Asian children outside their area so that a child won't be identified by other members of the community. We found that a lot of social workers from other agencies were saying to us that they'd love to place their child with us but that their adoption panel would never approve us. Or they'd say that because we weren't Muslim they couldn't consider us. We were never clear whether this was really true or because we were lesbians. </p> <p>\"We wanted to adopt a large group of sisters who had all been sexually abused and couldn't be placed anywhere with a male carer. But we were still turned down by the panel because they said it would be inappropriate to place them with lesbians. I understand that no one else could be found to take them and that they had to be split up between different foster homes. </p> <p>\"I heard later that one of them took an overdose and another had an abortion. Apparently, they believe that the reason that they didn't get adopted is that no one wanted them.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Lesbian and Gay Foster and Adoptive Parents' Network is holding a conference on May 6 for lesbians and gay men involved or interested in adoption and fostering.

As you come in the front door, nearly 20 photographs of her, from babyhood up, have been mounted in a single frame. On a shelf below, there are files of letters and documents, one containing her criminal record. There is a vase with a single daffodil in it. Tomorrow, it will be a year since Jenny hanged herself in a cell in Holloway prison. Because it was a bank holiday, some of the staff were off duty and she had had to be put in a single cell. When the staff came back on the Tuesday, she was to have been moved to a dormitory. At the inquest, the prison officer on night duty reported that he had handed over all the prisoners in his care.

Answers to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.</p> <p>Last week we asked which three Manchester United players captained England in the same international match. Even FA statistician David Barber isn't sure - although if it did happen, it is likely to have occurred during Bryan Robson's reign, he says. But it is not, as many of you have suggested, the Morocco-England 1986 World Cup match, when an injured Robson was replaced as captain by Ray Wilkins who was then sent off - because Wilkins was at Milan at the time and there were no other United players past or present on the pitch.

But the club started the Warzycha Family Fund to help manage the financial burden of the treatment, and he made a full recovery. Robert, now 36, is still at the Crew, and has started six games this season, scoring one goal. He is also sixth all-time on the MLS assist chart with 32. Only three players have come on as a substitute in an FA Cup final and scored two goals. Who are they? asks Paul Cowell Ian Rush and Stuart McCall both scored a brace after coming off the bench in the 1989 final between Liverpool and Everton. Ian Wright repeated the trick a year later for Crystal Palace against Manchester United. Can you help? I can recall transfers taking place between Manchester Utd and just about every top side in England - except Liverpool. Have the two clubs ever concluded a transfer deal. If so, when and involving whom? (And if not, why not?) asks Kevin Smith. Answers to the.boss@theguardian.com. Last week we asked which three Manchester United players captained England in the same international match. Even FA statistician David Barber isn't sure - although if it did happen, it is likely to have occurred during Bryan Robson's reign, he says. But it is not, as many of you have suggested, the Morocco-England 1986 World Cup match, when an injured Robson was replaced as captain by Ray Wilkins who was then sent off - because Wilkins was at Milan at the time and there were no other United players past or present on the pitch.

In a half-page advertisement printed in the Times, more than 150 journalists, lawyers, academics and MPs have condemned the government for threatening the freedom of the press by pursuing the newspapers through the courts. Signatories to the petition, which calls on the attorney general to stop the proceedings immediately, include David Yelland, editor of the Sun, Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror, and Ben Bradlee, vice-president of the Washington Post. Today's development has added to the clamour for the government to drop the action brought by special branch, which is trying to prosecute Mr Shayler under the Official Secrets Act. In March an Old Bailey judge ordered the newspapers to hand over any documents and emails relating to Mr Shayler, after the Observer published a front page report claiming that he had named two MI6 agents and the Guardian published a letter written by the former MI5 agent, who is living in exile in France. In a case that has serious implications for press freedom, Judge Martin Stephens said any material the newspapers might possess could help police in their attempts to prosecute Mr Shayler. The newspapers have applied for judicial review of the decision and have vowed to take the case all the way to the European court of human rights if necessary. According to today's advert, if the newspapers lose the case Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, Roger Alton, editor of the Observer, and the Observer journalist Martin Bright could face prison sentences. \"We are shocked that the government should allow these intimidatory proceedings to go forward into the courts,\" the advert says. \"The freedom of information and expression are inextricably linked together as a bedrock of democracy. \"The attorney general, the government's legal adviser, has the power to stop these proceedings at a stroke.

According to the local government chronicle elections centre at Plymouth University, they have made 34 net gains while Labour has taken only one seat. The Lib Dems have been losing ground to the Tories in the south and gaining seats from Labour in the north.</p> <p>The centre calculates that if this pattern is repeated tomorrow, Tories will gain 350 seats on the 152 local authorities where elections are being held. This should give them control of a further 10 councils. But since 131 local authorities are only choosing a third of their councillors, there is little likelihood of wholesale changes in council control.</p> <p>Mr Hague should take particular comfort in one small part of England. Due to boundary revision, seats on all six district councils in Surrey are being contested. The Tories control one authority. They should control all six by Friday.

      "bodyText": "The Tories appear on course to repeat last year's European election success by polling more votes than Labour in tomorrow's local elections, with councils from Solihull to Southend likely to change hands. But while William Hague is poised to proclaim a great victory over the government in contests outside London, a low turnout - and the relatively small number of seats at stake (3,360) - means few conclusions can be drawn about the outcome of the general election, likely next year. That will not stop the Tory leader claiming he has touched the popular mood by playing a law and order card which has highlighted the issues of \"bogus\" asylum seekers and rural crime. Since last year's local elections, the Tories have made modest advances after overtaking the Liberal Democrats to become the second party of local government once again. According to the local government chronicle elections centre at Plymouth University, they have made 34 net gains while Labour has taken only one seat. The Lib Dems have been losing ground to the Tories in the south and gaining seats from Labour in the north. The centre calculates that if this pattern is repeated tomorrow, Tories will gain 350 seats on the 152 local authorities where elections are being held. This should give them control of a further 10 councils. But since 131 local authorities are only choosing a third of their councillors, there is little likelihood of wholesale changes in council control. Mr Hague should take particular comfort in one small part of England. Due to boundary revision, seats on all six district councils in Surrey are being contested. The Tories control one authority. They should control all six by Friday. If they don't, any Tory revival will appear extremely fragile. After dismally low turnouts last year, which dropped below 20% in many inner city wards, Labour's main battle will be persuading sceptical supporters to vote. Although the party is nearly 20% ahead of the Tories in opinion polls, every election since 1997 has seen Labour struggling to convert those ratings into votes. But it can take comfort from the fact that opposition council gains give little pointer to the outcome of a general election. During Neil Kinnock's period as Labour leader, for instance, the party always outpolled the Tories in local elections. But the hapless Mr Kinnock could not unseat Margaret Thatcher or John Major.",

On the opening day of the trial, more than 11 years after the December 1988 bombing that killed 270 people, the court heard that lawyers acting for Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, 48, and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 44, would produce evidence that would incriminate others for the world's worst ever airline bombing, The clerk to the specially-convened Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands read a list of Arabic names of people he said the defence would claim were the real Lockerbie bombers, including members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and members of another group called the PPSF. It took 20 minutes to read the indictment against the defendants and the clerk of the court then announced that both men were pleading not guilty to all charges. The first witness in the trial was then called - Heathrow-based air traffic controller Richard Dawson, 52, from Taplow, Bucks. The packed public section of the courtroom watched through a bullet-proof screen as Mr Dawsonwas questioned by Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC, who is heading the prosecution team. The two men are being tried at Camp Zeist near Utrecht, under special arrangements agreed with the Libyan government. The Libyan leader, Col Gadafy, pledged in an interview with Sky News to accept the verdict but dismissed as \"absurd\" a suggestion that the two Libyans accused of the bombing were acting under his direct orders. Asked in an interview if he would accept the verdict as \"fair and just\", he said: \"All parties have agreed to accept the rule of the law, the rule of the court.\" The trial, expected to last at least a year, is being held at a former US air force base at Camp Zeist, near Utrecht. The trial is being held under Scottish law, but with three judges instead of a jury. All 259 passengers and crew and 11 residents of Lockerbie died when a PanAm Boeing 747 disintegrated in mid-air and crashed on the Scottish town on December 21, 1988. The two suspects are accused of murder, conspiracy to murder and violation of the Aviation Security Act. They have pleaded not guilty, deny working as secret service agents and say they were just employees of Libyan Arab Airlines. Responding to a suggestion that the two suspects were acting under his direct orders, Col Gadafy said: \"It is an absurd question that should not have been asked.\" Col Gadafy said the court would try the two Libyans only, and that they should bear individual responsibility for the bombing if they were found guilty. After the verdict there should be no further investigations into his own actions or those of Libyan officials. \"By and large the responsibility as far as this matter is concerned is an individual one.

It was known that the United States had many enemies and had committed \"grisly\" crimes. Anyone who wanted revenge against the US could have carried out the Lockerbie bombing, Col Gadafy said.

Civil Aviation Authority officials, police officers and local people who saw the disaster unfold were likely to be among the first witnesses giving evidence. Elsewhere in the interview, Col Gadafy accused British intelligence of plotting to kill him, saying: \"It is a known fact that British intelligence recruited stooges for agents to assassinate me. \"And it is also a known story that the bomb that was thrown at me by an agent who was recruited by British intelligence.\" Col Gadafy also pledged Libyan cooperation to find the killer of Pc Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot dead outside the Libyan People's Bureau in London in 1984.

      "bodyText": "The Northern Ireland peace process was in confusion last night after Tony Blair failed to reach agreement with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, to allow a fresh round of talks. After more than seven hours of negotiations with the province's main political parties in Downing Street, Mr Ahern underlined the differences between London and Dublin when he said that the talks, scheduled to take place in Northern Ireland tomorrow, might be called off. His remarks contrasted with an upbeat view from Downing Street, where the prime minister's official spokesman announced that the two prime ministers would reconvene with the political parties tomorrow at Hillsbrough Castle, Co Down. Mr Ahern said that he would talk to Mr Blair by phone today, but added he was \"not sure\" if they had \"reached the point where we can hold those [Hillsbrough] discussions\". Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, played down any differences. \"I can't predict precisely at this stage what the travel movements of the [British] prime minister are going to be, but he's very engaged in this,\" said Mr Mandelson. \"We have made progress, we have been able to narrow the differences between the parties, and it's that that has justified the involvement of the taoiseach and the prime minister today.\" Relations between Mr Blair and Mr Ahern were strained when Mr Mandelson suspended the power-sharing executive this year, although ministers in London and Dublin insist both have worked hard to repair relations. The conflicting signals came after Mr Blair and Mr Ahern held talks at Downing Street with Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and Sinn Fein. The two governments had hoped to forward new proposals that would see emphasis on IRA decommissioning reduced, so long as the IRA could be persuaded to make a strong statement to re-assure Ulster Unionists about its future intentions. The governments were hoping David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, could be persuaded to take one last gamble with his party's ruling council, and again enter government with Sinn Fein without prior IRA decommissioning. There is an urgency to make progress before May 22, the second anniversary of the referendums ratifying the Good Friday agreement; the date is hugely symbolic, because it had at one stage been hoped that decommissioning would be complete by then. A mood is growing that the issue of decommissioning, first raised by Sir Patrick Mayhew, then Northern Ireland secretary, in 1995, is the wrong test on which to gauge terrorists' intentions; the security forces insist that decommissioning would not in itself mean the threat of violence was gone for good. Michael McGimpsey, one of Mr Trimble's ministers before the executive was suspended after 72 days, said last night that if there was a better way than decommissioning to reassure Unionists, his party was prepared to listen. He said the outlook was more positive than negative. In the Irish Republic, relatives of \"disappeared\" IRA murder victims watched as the final search for their remains began.

He told Wilkinson that it was \"really urgent\" to get hold of Ali Bacher for Hansie - he didn't have to explain why. Cronje's subsequent conversation would destroy his career, and throw world cricket into turmoil. </p> <p>Wilkinson was completely stunned. \"I had honestly believed that he had nothing to do with it. I'd previously sat down with Hansie and Dr Bacher and he [Hansie] had denied it, and I'd just been completely baffled by the story. I knew about the '96 offer [when the South African team turned down $250,000 to throw a one-day international against India, at Bombay] which Hansie had talked about in an interview two years ago, but I had never heard the remotest rumour about any South African player. It was an unbelievably bad day.\"</p> <p>At seven that morning Wilkinson confirmed to the horrified South African press corps that Cronje had been removed from the squad. She then met Dr Bacher (the UCB's managing director) in Durban, where they saw the South African team and Bacher confronted each player in turn about any involvement with Cronje: \"It was very tense, the team were still trying to absorb what was going on\". At one o'clock, Wilkinson, the new captain Shaun Pollock, Percy Sonn (the UCB's president) and a \"totally shattered\" Bacher faced the media at that press conference. She had been in the job a month.</p> <p>Perhaps only Gavin Hamilton has had a more fiery baptism in South African cricket, but no-one disputes Wilkinson's class. Though only 33, she is one of the most successful journalists in South Africa. \"She could have practically walked into any job in the South African media,\" says one journalist who has worked there.</p> <p>In the early 90's she worked on The Star, one of South Africa's biggest daily papers, as a crime and political reporter - \"the two mostly dovetailed in those days\". In 1993, her career was blown slightly off course: in August she was shot in the elbow by a sniper. \"it was only a percussion wound,\" she says. (Only?) Shortly afterwards she discovered that she was pregnant: \"It was a big year for me.\" She transferred to a desk job, from where she covered the lead-up to the 1994 elections, and when she returned from maternity leave that August (after giving birth to a son, Matthew), moved to the sports desk of the Saturday Star and Sunday Independent. She was made sports editor in 1996, and remained there until early 1999 when she was appointed the editor of TML's Sportsday, the first daily sports paper in South Africa. </p> <p>Her appointment was a landmark in South African newspaper history. Wilkinson was the first South African woman to edit a national daily paper, and the almost-simultaneous appointments of Paula Fray to the editorship of the Saturday Star and Lakela Kaunda to the Evening Post (an Eastern Cape paper), meant that a male-dominated industry had three female editors. Wilkinson also made an effort to recruit black staff to her small editorial team. \"It was something that I specifically wanted to do, there were lots of young black sportswriters working on bigger papers, but I was able to give them more senior roles.\"</p> <p>After six months, the paper folded, because of financial difficulties and the itchy feet of shareholders. Wilkinson was dismayed: \"I loved it, it was a very big challenge and I still think it had great editorial.\" She freelanced for a while before joining the UCB at the beginning of March this year. Her role is a new one, though Chris Day had previously been employed as a consultant, and her department is just that - her . So when the Cronje story broke she was bombarded. \"I quite enjoy pressure, but I never, ever thought I'd get pressure like that. One day I took over 465 calls and the demands on my time have been utterly outstanding.</p> <p>\"I said to someone on a radio station that I would like to go back to every police and political spokesperson who I spoke to when I was a reporter, and say that I now realise my call wasn't the only one they had to take. Maybe every journalist should have to work as a spokesperson. I think the fact that I was a journalist helped a lot. I know journalists' requirements. With the Hansie story there were so many rumours I just tried to give out as much information as I could. Hopefully with more facts, there are fewer rumours.\"</p> <p>Cricket, the game with bat and ball, was forgotten. \"The thing that I really found quite stunning was that from the time the Australian media landed [for the one-day series] up until the first game at Durban, not one journalist asked me a cricket question. Not one had asked me for a possible squad. It was really, really strange. We were about to start what for the South African public and players was an enormous series, but they [the journalists]; were all working flat out on the Hansie story.\" </p> <p>Cronje has not been in contact with Wilkinson, his team's nerve centre, for a while. (She hasn't been singled out. Teammates, too, have been given the cold shoulder.) She feels she got to know him quite well, especially during those intense few days before he was sacked. Does she think that the transcripts are true? \"I honestly don't know. I haven't heard them. [Though] I don't believe any police force in the world would release anything unless they were pretty sure what they were doing.\"</p> <p>Her world has quietened down a little, for now, until the judicial enquiry is announced. Which is good news for her second husband, Chris. They only married in January and within three months he found himself looking after Matthew, now five, whom he is in the process of adopting, while his wife virtually disappeared for three weeks. She is extremely grateful: \"In most families that would mean that the five basic food groups would include Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, but not with Chris, he's been great.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson's husband is a financial services consultant, and a former magistrate. A suitable match for an ex-crime reporter. \"Our experiences have served us very well in the last couple of weeks,\" she says wryly. And she intends to use them again. She hopes, eventually, to write a book about the whole Cronje story. So perhaps one day we will learn the real truth, however much the ICC procrastinate.</p> <p><em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

      "bodyText": "Fellow actors in the forthcoming adaptation of Helen Fielding's ubiquitous Bridget Jones' Diary have moved to defuse bad feeling surrounding the casting of American starlet Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as the eponymous British heroine. The British press have been sniffy about the casting, citing Kate Winslet, Helena Bonham-Carter and Emily Watson as actresses who ought to have been preferred for the role. Zellweger has courted further resentment with her high-handed approach to the project, which included, according to reports, refusing to test for the film, on the assumption that she was celebrated enough to be offered the part unseen. Fielding - who has distanced herself from the film - registered only lukewarm enthusiasm for its star, saying \"I've never met Ren\u00e9e, but I'm told she's very funny and learning to speak English with an English rather than Texas accent.\" But Zellweger's co-star Hugh Grant leapt to her defence between the covers of Entertainment Weekly this week. \"I've met Ren\u00e9e a couple of times, and she is bang-on,\" says Grant, demonstrating his mastery of street slang. \"She's very funny, and she's been living in England a long time now, mastering the accent. It'll be a triumph. I know it will.\"",

Chico Marx, who was there at about the same time, was less rapturously received.\" </p> <p>When I was a student in the 60s, Sartre didn't have poster status - his pipe, glasses and air of bad-temper kept him off walls that celebrated Che, Brigitte Bardot and James Dean - but few student bookshelves lacked a (largely) unread copy of his exegesis of existentialism, the 632 page Being and Nothingness. From the little we (I) read, we understood only what suited us, but, growing up in a world still scarred by global war and haunted by the Holocaust and the Bomb, it was not hard to grasp a philosophy predicated on the absolute absence of God. If we understood Sartre superficially, we understood him sufficiently to corroborate our feelings of confusion about our sexual and political identity. \"First of all, man exists,\" he said, \"turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards, defines himself.\" That seemed to describe our condition pretty accurately, and his argument for the reality of \"nothingness\" hit the mark as far as student life was concerned. </p> <p>Although Sartre's philosophy remained more talked about than read, his novels were popular (Roads to Freedom was serialised by the BBC) and his plays were much performed. In fact, it was practically a legal obligation in the 60s for student drama groups to perform Huis Clos. The play is a philosophical game, written in response to three actors who asked Sartre for a piece in which all the characters would have equal status, the same number of lines, and remain onstage throughout the action. (What is it about French theatre? Cocteau wrote The Eagle Has Two Heads for the actor Jean Marais, who told him, \"I want to do three things in a play - I want to be silent in the first act, I want to cry with joy in the second, and I want to come down a long staircase in the third.\") </p> <p>Sartre was attracted to the theatre (and fiction) because theatre thrives on metaphor - a room becomes a world, a group of characters becomes a whole society - so plays tend to be about how we live and why we live. In the theatre Sartre was obliged to characterise and animate his philosophical and political propositions, test theory against flesh and blood. And he was obliged to condense and distil his ideas. \"The metaphysician who could not say anything unless he said everything was compelled in the theatre to give his message briefly,\" said Iris Murdoch, \"and as Sartre unfortunately could not do everything, as opposed to thinking everything, he found the theatre, where he had undoubted talent, a sympathetic place to drop into.\" What's more, Sartre liked the fact that theatre happens in the present tense: \"You can't write a play without urgency in it,\" he said, \"and this urgency comes back to you because it is felt by the audience.\" </p> <p>I appeared in two of Sartre's plays as a student actor, and I became familiar with all of them. In time they became theatrically extinct, but fashion in the theatre is as cyclical as in music, even if the cycles recur more slowly. Around the time that we had a success with Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles at the National, our then literary manager, Giles Croft, scratched an itch in my memory by suggesting that I look at Les Mains Sales (Dirty Hands). It is a noirish political thriller, set in a fictional east European country (\"Illyria\") in the dying days of the second world war. A young man is commissioned by a revolutionary Socialist Party to assassinate the leader of a rival faction, who is held to be diluting the party's principles by forming a coalition government with liberal and right wing parties. The play was better than I remembered it from the 60s: perhaps the distance of history and the collapse of communism made its concerns resonate more strongly. But it didn't demand to be performed and I forgot about the play until several years later. </p> <p>Two years ago I spent the greater part of the year on a film which was never made. This is a familiar condition for anyone who flirts with the film industry, but the involvement of Glenn Close and Meryl Streep seemed a reasonable assurance of a green light at the end of the tunnel. When the film was cancelled I found myself with a continent of unexplored time, and at Jonathan Kent's suggestion I looked again at Les Mains Sales. My re-reading of the play coincided with the peace negotiations in Northern Ireland and with rancorous bickering between Old and New Labour. \"Principle\", \"pragmatism\" and \"power-sharing\" were words that rained down from all directions, while the metaphor of \"dirty hands\" was invoked on a daily basis. It seemed that perhaps Sartre's play was a play for today. </p> <p>Les Mains Sales was first performed in 1948, and was widely interpreted as an attack on communism. While Sartre clearly intended to indict the unscrupulousness of the communist party, it is part of the virtue of the play that the \"attack\" is equivocal. Infuriated that his play was being used to castigate the left, he forbade further performances in 1952. Partly it was the debate between means and ends, purity and opportunism that attracted me to the play, but it was just as much its exploration of class, of sex, and of growing up. Like Hamlet, Hugo, the play's protagonist, grows up to grow dead. In making my version of the play, I've filtered Sartre's play through my own sensibility: the title of The Novice reflects my view that the play is as much about innocence as about belief and expediency. </p> <p>Sartre has become an unfashionable playwright, a largely unread novelist, and is scorned as a misogynist: Angela Carter once commented, \"There is one question that every thinking woman in the western world must have asked herself at one time or another. Why is a nice girl like Simone de Beauvoir sucking up to a boring old fart like Jean-Paul Sartre?\" The old fart may be regarded as irrelevant as a philosopher, but for me his concern with our disposition to evade responsibility and to lie to ourselves - our \"bad faith\" - is as active a notion as when I first came across it. And in an age when we appear to believe nothing except celebrity, I can't think that a writer who says that we define man only in relation to his commitments is entirely redundant. </p> <p>Just before Christmas of last year, I arrived in Paris on the Eurostar.

Usually they've got a good story in its own right and it doesn't need any dressing up because the facts are more interesting and exciting than fiction. \"Previous evidence of American film-making of war stories is not all that good\", Lockwood adds. \"I mean, they had Errol Flynn winning the war in Burma when there was no American involved in that operation at all.\" Similarly, The Great Escape starred US star Steve McQueen in a film that should have been about Britons tunnelling free from a German camp; while Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan saw the US take on the Germans single-handedly on D-Day. The latest offender is the submarine drama and current US chart-topper U-571, which shows the Americans, and not the Brits, capturing the Germans' Enigma decoding device. Lockwood condemns the film as \"a distortion of history. They should be more responsible. Money - that's all it's about. It's about how much they can get.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Carol Vorderman, alas, failed her \u00a31m (or \u00a3250,000, to be exact) test. But she can console herself with the thought that her performance on a celebrity version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Monday night at least enhanced her celebrity. For long after this infuriatingly gimmicky programme is buried, Vorderman will have earned eternal fame in the dictionary of great philistinism with Henry Ford (\"History is bunk\"), Kingsley Amis (\"Filthy Mozart\") and Bobby Fischer (\"Girls are a waste of time\"). </p> <p>Explaining afterwards her failure to recognise Sir Toby Belch as a character from Twelfth Night, Vorderman declared she found the work of William Shakespeare \"dull as ditchwater\". Is it? One has to make allowance for pique. (And why, I've sometimes wondered, is ditchwater considered all that dull - duller, say, than tap water, Grolsch, or three-day-old Nescafe?) And, of course, you would have to know Shakespeare's plays to know he was duller than Oscar Wilde or Andrew Lloyd Webber. </p> <p>But it was such an easy question; all over the country viewers must have been yelling the answer at their screen. As a test of literary knowledge it was only one up from \"Is Hamlet a place or a prince?\", \"Who kills Desdemona?\" or \"Is Henry V a war criminal?\" (OK, I'll come clean: the last is the title of my latest book.) </p> <p>It would be nice to think that Vorderman - who is to all appearances a well-educated woman by the standards of the day - might have been getting in a feminist smack against one of Shakespeare's men behaving badly. Belch, as his name indicates, really is a pig; Shakespeare could as well have called him Fart. But you would have to be very feminist to risk the derision of a nation to make such a point. </p> <p>For the observer of cultural drift and change, Vorderman's anti-Shakespeareanism is sadly symptomatic. She is a child of the time (from which play is that a quote, Guardian reader?). The bard's stock is sinking. </p> <p>It is now possible to get a degree in English in the US and Britain without having studied a single play by Shakespeare (in my department, I'm happy to say, you won't graduate unless you know all 39 well enough to take a six-hour exam on them - but we're very old-fashioned). </p> <p>It's difficult to find a British A-level board that will let you do English without knowing at least one Shakespeare text inside out but, with persistence, you can do it. And with the new half A-levels coming along (\"A/S\", they're called) you'll certainly be able to detour round the bard. </p> <p>It's a threshold moment in the subject. In the US, if you skim through the college catalogues, you'll see that the author who has replaced Shakespeare at the centre of the curriculum is Toni Morrison. </p> <p>I don't know, but I suspect that if Vorderman had been asked \"In what novel does Paul D feature?\", she would have known the answer without thinking twice (\"Beloved!\") and gone home with her barrow-load of money (all for charity, of course). And who would dare say, in this day and age, \"Toni Morrison is crap\"? </p> <p>Why do we deify Shakespeare? Why is he what Matthew Arnold called our \"touchstone\" - the gold standard of literary excellence? The answer that would have been given 100 years ago is that his works are a fountain of great truth about the human condition. \"To be, or not to be?\" - what thinking person has not pondered the question? \"Plate sin with gold, and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks\": true at all times, in all places. \"This above all else, to thine own self be true\": as good advice now as it was 400 years ago. </p> <p>The argument was revived two years ago by Harold Bloom, who argued in Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human that before Shakespeare came along we weren't homo sapiens. He gave us the equipment with which to understand ourselves and to become ourselves. Bloom's book was a bestseller. But it was, surely, a ludicrous proposition. Would Chaucer, for instance, have been a more human writer had he read the 39 plays? </p> <p>Our defence of Shakespeare would, I think, be more modest. He wrote such wonderful English. No one has ever done such beautiful things with our beautiful language. </p> <p>Just published and being reviewed at the moment is a book by this country's most distinguished living literary critic, Frank Kermode. As I understand it, Kermode's line in Shakespeare's Language is eminently commonsensical. He eschews the currently fashionable admiration for the complicated expression of some of the late plays (glance at the opening speech of Measure for Measure to see how complicated Shakespeare can be) and locates the greatness of Shakespeare in the limpid English of the dramatist's middle period. The best Shakespeare is the Shakespeare we understand best. </p> <p>The evidence from the classroom, meanwhile, carries both dispiriting and encouraging messages for those of us who care whether others care about the bard. I've been teaching Shakespeare for 30 years. Students, of course, make the same kinds of howler that they always have and always will. They'll talk about Macbeth's \"unforgettable line, 'Is this a knife I see before me'\", or write, as one did recently for me, \"Ophelia approaches Hamlet, in spite of his railings\". Nowadays it's an unusual school leaver who knows more than the two plays set for A-level. </p> <p>But in many ways today's undergraduates see things that their predecessors didn't - and which, frankly, I didn't see until quite recently. It was, for example, a woman student who pointed out to me the interesting fact that Portia, at the end of The Merchant of Venice, has been married for three days and is still a virgin (women notice these things). Gender, Race and Queer Theory have unlocked aspects of Shakespeare which speak to us and our time. Lisa Jardine's probings about Cordelia's mother (and mothers in general in Shakespeare) create an entirely new - and for my money, exciting - Lear. After the Holocaust, The Merchant of Venice is a much more problematic \"comedy\" than it ever was for Coleridge; as is Othello after Stephen Lawrence. And it is our generation, and notably its youngest echelon of critics, who have explored the gay Shakespeare (why is Portia still a virgin? Because, plausibly, Bassanio is really in love with Antonio). The miracle of Shakespeare is that, as Jan Kott once put it, he is always our contemporary. </p> <p>Shakespeare, it has to be said, can be deadly dull. It's not his fault, but ours. Four hundred years ago the ear of the English populace was an organ trained by obligatory attendance at church, where you would listen, willy nilly, to two-hour sermons. They were world-class listeners, the Elizabethans and Jacobeans. Our ears, trained by three-minute MTV clips, short-burst cellphone conversations and Harold Pinter's silences can't handle long Shakespearean periods. By the end of the speech (and sometimes the sentence) we've forgotten the beginning.

      "bodyText": "Carol Vorderman, alas, failed her \u00a31m (or \u00a3250,000, to be exact) test. But she can console herself with the thought that her performance on a celebrity version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Monday night at least enhanced her celebrity. For long after this infuriatingly gimmicky programme is buried, Vorderman will have earned eternal fame in the dictionary of great philistinism with Henry Ford (\"History is bunk\"), Kingsley Amis (\"Filthy Mozart\") and Bobby Fischer (\"Girls are a waste of time\"). Explaining afterwards her failure to recognise Sir Toby Belch as a character from Twelfth Night, Vorderman declared she found the work of William Shakespeare \"dull as ditchwater\". Is it? One has to make allowance for pique. (And why, I've sometimes wondered, is ditchwater considered all that dull - duller, say, than tap water, Grolsch, or three-day-old Nescafe?) And, of course, you would have to know Shakespeare's plays to know he was duller than Oscar Wilde or Andrew Lloyd Webber. But it was such an easy question; all over the country viewers must have been yelling the answer at their screen. As a test of literary knowledge it was only one up from \"Is Hamlet a place or a prince?\", \"Who kills Desdemona?\" or \"Is Henry V a war criminal?\" (OK, I'll come clean: the last is the title of my latest book.) It would be nice to think that Vorderman - who is to all appearances a well-educated woman by the standards of the day - might have been getting in a feminist smack against one of Shakespeare's men behaving badly. Belch, as his name indicates, really is a pig; Shakespeare could as well have called him Fart. But you would have to be very feminist to risk the derision of a nation to make such a point. For the observer of cultural drift and change, Vorderman's anti-Shakespeareanism is sadly symptomatic. She is a child of the time (from which play is that a quote, Guardian reader?). The bard's stock is sinking. It is now possible to get a degree in English in the US and Britain without having studied a single play by Shakespeare (in my department, I'm happy to say, you won't graduate unless you know all 39 well enough to take a six-hour exam on them - but we're very old-fashioned). It's difficult to find a British A-level board that will let you do English without knowing at least one Shakespeare text inside out but, with persistence, you can do it. And with the new half A-levels coming along (\"A/S\", they're called) you'll certainly be able to detour round the bard. It's a threshold moment in the subject. In the US, if you skim through the college catalogues, you'll see that the author who has replaced Shakespeare at the centre of the curriculum is Toni Morrison. I don't know, but I suspect that if Vorderman had been asked \"In what novel does Paul D feature?\", she would have known the answer without thinking twice (\"Beloved!\") and gone home with her barrow-load of money (all for charity, of course). And who would dare say, in this day and age, \"Toni Morrison is crap\"? Why do we deify Shakespeare? Why is he what Matthew Arnold called our \"touchstone\" - the gold standard of literary excellence? The answer that would have been given 100 years ago is that his works are a fountain of great truth about the human condition. \"To be, or not to be?\" - what thinking person has not pondered the question? \"Plate sin with gold, and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks\": true at all times, in all places. \"This above all else, to thine own self be true\": as good advice now as it was 400 years ago. The argument was revived two years ago by Harold Bloom, who argued in Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human that before Shakespeare came along we weren't homo sapiens. He gave us the equipment with which to understand ourselves and to become ourselves. Bloom's book was a bestseller. But it was, surely, a ludicrous proposition. Would Chaucer, for instance, have been a more human writer had he read the 39 plays? Our defence of Shakespeare would, I think, be more modest. He wrote such wonderful English. No one has ever done such beautiful things with our beautiful language. Just published and being reviewed at the moment is a book by this country's most distinguished living literary critic, Frank Kermode. As I understand it, Kermode's line in Shakespeare's Language is eminently commonsensical. He eschews the currently fashionable admiration for the complicated expression of some of the late plays (glance at the opening speech of Measure for Measure to see how complicated Shakespeare can be) and locates the greatness of Shakespeare in the limpid English of the dramatist's middle period. The best Shakespeare is the Shakespeare we understand best. The evidence from the classroom, meanwhile, carries both dispiriting and encouraging messages for those of us who care whether others care about the bard. I've been teaching Shakespeare for 30 years. Students, of course, make the same kinds of howler that they always have and always will. They'll talk about Macbeth's \"unforgettable line, 'Is this a knife I see before me'\", or write, as one did recently for me, \"Ophelia approaches Hamlet, in spite of his railings\". Nowadays it's an unusual school leaver who knows more than the two plays set for A-level. But in many ways today's undergraduates see things that their predecessors didn't - and which, frankly, I didn't see until quite recently. It was, for example, a woman student who pointed out to me the interesting fact that Portia, at the end of The Merchant of Venice, has been married for three days and is still a virgin (women notice these things). Gender, Race and Queer Theory have unlocked aspects of Shakespeare which speak to us and our time. Lisa Jardine's probings about Cordelia's mother (and mothers in general in Shakespeare) create an entirely new - and for my money, exciting - Lear. After the Holocaust, The Merchant of Venice is a much more problematic \"comedy\" than it ever was for Coleridge; as is Othello after Stephen Lawrence. And it is our generation, and notably its youngest echelon of critics, who have explored the gay Shakespeare (why is Portia still a virgin? Because, plausibly, Bassanio is really in love with Antonio). The miracle of Shakespeare is that, as Jan Kott once put it, he is always our contemporary. Shakespeare, it has to be said, can be deadly dull. It's not his fault, but ours. Four hundred years ago the ear of the English populace was an organ trained by obligatory attendance at church, where you would listen, willy nilly, to two-hour sermons. They were world-class listeners, the Elizabethans and Jacobeans. Our ears, trained by three-minute MTV clips, short-burst cellphone conversations and Harold Pinter's silences can't handle long Shakespearean periods. By the end of the speech (and sometimes the sentence) we've forgotten the beginning. Which is why, if truth be told, most of us get much more out of reading his plays than watching them in the theatre (particularly if, as in the Globe shrine-theatre on the South Bank, you have to stand three hours in the drizzle). But, 400 years on, no one is going to be watching reruns of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Will they still be reading Toni Morrison? Perhaps. Will they still be performing Shakespeare, and studying him? Nothing is more certain.

      "bodyText": "US scientists have discovered cracks at the bottom of the North Atlantic which they believe may augur an underwater landslide, sending tidal waves more than 20ft high towards North Carolina, Virginia and the US capital, Washington. The cracks were found about 80 miles east of Chesapeake Bay, a popular weekend resort for Washingtonians. Their existence and potential for disaster were reported in the May edition of the journal Geology, but the scientists who came across them said that they were unsure how old the fissures were. \"These cracks, together with evidence of past landslides in the same area, indicate that the sea floor could slump, or slide downhill like an avalanche, triggering the waves,\" said Neal Driscoll, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and one of the authors of the report. A team of oceanographers and geologists is scheduled to mount an expedition to the site on Saturday to explore the cracks. They will use sonar equipment to determine the urgency of the threat. Underwater landslides, in which large chunks of the seabed fall into fissures, can be triggered by changing water temperatures and the sudden release of methane gas frozen within the ocean floor. Such a landslide in the Grand Banks under the North Atlantic sent a 40ft tidal wave washing over the Newfoundland coast in 1929, killing 51 people. Another huge wave, also known as a tsunami, hit Papua New Guinea in 1998, causing 2,000 deaths. Mr Driscoll, one of the scientists who identified the cracks, said that people living along the US eastern seaboard had become accustomed to hurricanes but had little experience of tidal waves, which could be just as devastating. \"Virginia, North Carolina and the lower Chesapeake Bay would be most at risk,\" he said. \"We have shied away from the W [for Washington] word, but most likely there would be some effect there.\" The cracks are under 300-600ft of water, and overlap like the tiles on a roof.

Even before the value of his Sports Internet shares increased by \u00a3100m, he was counting a newly made multi-million pound fortune. In August 1998 he received \u00a325m when Planet Online, a company he had founded just three years earlier, was sold to Energis, the telecoms group, for \u00a375m. He then engineered Dixons' hugely successful Freeserve internet access service which the retailer set up with Energis. Mr Wilkinson has a lucrative royalty deal linked to traffic generated by Freeserve's 1.8m plus users. Mr Wilkinson, who lives near Harrogate with his wife and four children, has two other businesses - a computer distributor, Storm, which he used to jointly own with Yorkshire property tycoon Paul Sykes, and VData, an offsite data storage organisation. He guards his privacy closely, rarely talks to journalists and dislikes leaving his native county. He describes himself as \"a typical Yorkshireman - a Scotsman without the generosity\". The potential sale of Sports Internet will come as little surprise to Mr Wilkinson's friends to whom he has talked colloquially about \"boshing this thing out quickly\". Sports Internet was set up by former Leeds United chief executive Chris Akers. His stake is valued at \u00a314m. Last night he refused to comment.",

      "body": "<p>Asthma, a curse of modern times, could be drastically reduced by an inoculation programme to expose babies to bacteria they are deprived of in the hygienic homes and hospitals of the 21st century, leading scientists believe.</p> <p>Within two years, John Warner, of the department of child health at Southampton university, one of the UK's leading specialists in childhood asthma, plans to start clinical trials on newborn babies.</p> <p>Within 10 years, the programme, if successful, could be extended nationwide and would cut the asthma rate from the current 20% of children to the 5% it used to be 20 years ago.</p> <p>All the evidence in asthma research is beginning to point the same way, he says - that our relatively sterile lives fail to expose the baby at the right time to bacteria that should flourish in the bowel and kickstart the immune system to fight off allergens.</p> <p>\"The theory gains credibility with every new piece of research that comes along. To delay any longer before starting these intervention trials is wasting time,\" said Professor Warner yesterday.</p> <p>He plans to start within a year by feeding bacteria to babies of a few weeks old. \"We'll do it with the bacteria normally present in your bowel.</p> <p>\"It would eventually get into the baby, but rather more slowly with our hygienic conditions. Either we could give it to them on a spoon or squirt it in with a syringe.\"</p> <p>He accepts that clinical trials on very young babies are highly sensitive, but points out that they are already given the harmless lactobacillus organism in neonatal intensive care units to help strengthen their immune systems.</p> <p>The inoculation trials might feature a tuberculosis type bug. The BCG, he explained, has already been given to small babies to protect them in areas where TB is rife. \"It only causes problems in profoundly immunodeficient individuals,\" he said.</p> <p>There is less and less dispute that the absence of dirt in our lives is responsible for the dramatic rise in asthma rates, he said. Although the rates are rising in developing countries too, the asthmatics are among the more affluent and those who have adopted westernised lifestyles.</p> <p>Professor Warner's research plans, announced at a conference organised by the Air Action Appeal charity, based at Southampton university, yesterday, follow the discovery by his team and another in the US of a molecule present in bacteria cells called CD14.</p> <p>It is this molecule that they hope to stimulate by introducing helpful bacteria.

      "bodyText": "Asthma, a curse of modern times, could be drastically reduced by an inoculation programme to expose babies to bacteria they are deprived of in the hygienic homes and hospitals of the 21st century, leading scientists believe. Within two years, John Warner, of the department of child health at Southampton university, one of the UK's leading specialists in childhood asthma, plans to start clinical trials on newborn babies. Within 10 years, the programme, if successful, could be extended nationwide and would cut the asthma rate from the current 20% of children to the 5% it used to be 20 years ago. All the evidence in asthma research is beginning to point the same way, he says - that our relatively sterile lives fail to expose the baby at the right time to bacteria that should flourish in the bowel and kickstart the immune system to fight off allergens. \"The theory gains credibility with every new piece of research that comes along. To delay any longer before starting these intervention trials is wasting time,\" said Professor Warner yesterday. He plans to start within a year by feeding bacteria to babies of a few weeks old. \"We'll do it with the bacteria normally present in your bowel. \"It would eventually get into the baby, but rather more slowly with our hygienic conditions. Either we could give it to them on a spoon or squirt it in with a syringe.\" He accepts that clinical trials on very young babies are highly sensitive, but points out that they are already given the harmless lactobacillus organism in neonatal intensive care units to help strengthen their immune systems. The inoculation trials might feature a tuberculosis type bug. The BCG, he explained, has already been given to small babies to protect them in areas where TB is rife. \"It only causes problems in profoundly immunodeficient individuals,\" he said. There is less and less dispute that the absence of dirt in our lives is responsible for the dramatic rise in asthma rates, he said. Although the rates are rising in developing countries too, the asthmatics are among the more affluent and those who have adopted westernised lifestyles. Professor Warner's research plans, announced at a conference organised by the Air Action Appeal charity, based at Southampton university, yesterday, follow the discovery by his team and another in the US of a molecule present in bacteria cells called CD14. It is this molecule that they hope to stimulate by introducing helpful bacteria. They have also discovered that the foetus be comes sensitive to allergens as early as 20 weeks gestation, picking up the mother's allergies through the amniotic fluid. It raises the possibility that immunising the mother could also prevent asthma in the baby. Dr John Harvey, of the British Thoracic Society, said he agreed that the introduction of bacteria to babies through inoculation could help reduce asthma rates. \"We know a lot more now about the way our immune system works in early life and how it has an effect on switching on allergic responses and how these can be damped down. There's a lot of evidence that modern lifestyle is one of the main reasons for this huge increase in asthma prevalence. \"Modifying the way our immune system is reared in the early months is going to be the way forward.\"",

      "bodyText": "Two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing go on trial for mass murder in the Netherlands this morning after stern warnings from Scottish court officials that the unique event would not be allowed to descend into a media frenzy. As relatives of the 270 victims began arriving at Camp Zeist, legal sources said the first prosecution evidence would come from police officers and air accident investigators who were at the scene on December 21 1988. Nearly 12 years after the worst act of terrorism in British history, endless diplomatic wrangling and intrigue, final preparations were being put in place at the former US air base near Utrecht, declared Scottish territory for the duration of the trial. \"I've got sort of a numb feeling and a good deal of anxiety over what might happen,\" said Daniel Cohen, whose 20-year- old daughter was one of the 190 Americans killed when Pan Am flight 103 exploded over the Borders town. Families expressed little expectation that the trial, expected to last at least a year, would answer all their questions about the disaster. \"I am hoping for justice and truth, but I don't think we'll get either,\" said Rosemary Wolfe, whose step-daughter Miriam, 20, died over Lockerbie. Jim Swire, spokesman for British relatives, said: \"It's been a ghastly 11 years. We expect the fairest obtainable verdict as to whether these two individuals are guilty or innocent.\" The accused, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, 48, and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhima, 44, face charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and violation of the Aviation Security Act. Prosecutors say they were Libyan intelligence agents who concealed a Semtex bomb in a Toshiba radio-cassette recorder inside an unaccompanied suitcase on a plane to Frankfurt. The suitcase was transferred in London onto the doomed New York flight. The two, who have pleaded not guilty, deny working as secret service agents and say they were employees of Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta. The indictment, which will be read out for the first time in court today, mentions by name several other members of Libyan intelligence, including two senior officers, Said Rashid and Ezzadin Hinshiri. Lawyers for the two accused have made clear that their main defence will be to incriminate members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command. Allegations have also been made of involvement by Iran and Syria. Failure to convict would leave the British and US governments in the embarrassing position of having pushed hard for a trial, compromised over the venue, and seen the rehabilitation of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy. Col Gadafy agreed to the UN-brokered deal to hand over the two defendants last April, apparently basing his decision on clear signals that two individuals, not his regime, would be in the dock. In recent months he has been wooed by the European Union, while western oil companies have beaten a path to his door. John Grant, a Scottish law professor, warned against expecting too much when the three judges - there is no jury - choose one of three verdicts: guilty, not guilty or not proven. \"One of the sad things is that families may not get the definitive answer some think they're going to get,\" Mr Grant said. \"This is not about who ordered the bombing of Pan Am 103, it's only about whether these two guys did it.\"",

      "body": "<p>Politics is not fun. Voting tomorrow? Consider then that politics is for making dull things work - making trains and drains run, schools and hospitals work, catching criminals, trading deals with foreigners, preventing poverty, looking after the old and sick. None of that is very exciting. If all worked well we should hire politicians to get on with it the way we hire others to keep the water, gas and electricity flowing, dull stuff unless something goes wrong. Let the politicians plough the fields of administration while the rest of us use our energies on more creative things - making money, bringing up children or communing with a life of the mind, the heart and the arts.</p> <p>The last century saw swathes of humanity hurtled to destruction through investing too much in politics. As God died those who sought the meaning of life in wrap-around political systems soon found themselves crushed to death by the monstrous boa constrictors they had created. Yet we still suffer a hangover from those times, an eerie void. You hear young people yearning nostalgically for the simplicity of the old days with something to fight for. The Spanish civil war was the great ideological adventure holiday of the previous generation. How some of us envied fathers who had been there.</p> <p>As this week marks the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war, you hear some kids saying with longing \"What did you do in the great anti-war demos, ma?\" Well, I say, yes, I was there near the front in Grosvenor Square, face squashed up against a police horse's backside when they burned the flag outside the US embassy. Was it bliss to be alive and so on? No, not now. Now I look back less in anger than embarrassment.</p> <p>Real babies were being napalmed while we in our flares and afghans fought at the battle front against a row of London bobbies (sorry, fascist pigs). What's more, after Kosovo I'm not even sure we were right. Or if we were I am a lot less sure that the Americans were wholly wrong. Any lost war is a war not worth fighting, but maybe there was more nobility in the attempt than we ever considered then. But that's another story - at the time there was a pleasing clarity of vision.</p> <p>Here at the start of a new century there is no shortage of great causes - third world debt, global warming, world trade, starvation, nuclear proliferation - but there is a hole in the heart of politics where ideology used to be. How much duller things are with no God and no isms, how technocratic, run by men and women with no rhetoric (or when foolishly attempted it's a toe-curling anachronism). Still steeped in the old ways, how eagerly they in the Commons and we who comment on them drum up every minor issue, harrumphing and inflating any small thing into some great ism whenever we can. Oh, call back yesterday, bid time return!</p> <p>In this frame of mind the voters of London will elect Ken Livingstone, he who is all our yesterdays personified. Viewed through rose-tinted spectacles, he fell before the wall fell, so much more fun those Maggie v Ken days. Tory and labour tribes alike are giving him their x's for old time's sake. Where's the anger, the clash, the panache now? Hague isn't worth hating, Blair is bland, democracy is bloodless, so vote for fun. Why not? What's the risk? \"Baring their bum at the emperor\" one insider said yesterday glumly. The whole country's in an arsey mood, intent on giving the government a bloody nose.</p> <p>At it's most extreme, it's the mood the eco-rioters caught too as they planted that lovely green punk turf on Sir Winston's head in a gesture far more arresting and imaginative than anything that won the Turner prize in recent years. One way or another a lot of people still want politics to be fun.</p> <p>What a luxury that is, how lucky we are, though at this point to mention Aung San Suu Kyi or Ken Saro Wiwa is like telling children to eat their crusts in the name of the starving of Ethiopia. But here we are with the best government we've had in years and all anyone wants to do is tweak its nose for fun. So secure are these voters in Labour's continuing power that they think they can afford fun and jam on it too.</p> <p>When challenged with their frivolity, Ken voters tend to turn defensive: \"Well it's all Blair's fault. If he hadn't tried his control freakery on London it never would have happened.\" It's a plausible excuse but bunk nonetheless. They'd have voted Ken come what may. They're bored, bored, bored with basically good dull government.</p> <p>When was politics last exciting to these dilettante voters? Why, exactly three years ago on the night of May 1. They were the ones who whinged all through the campaign that they probably wouldn't bother to vote. What's the point? Blair's a Tory, nothing to choose between the parties, yawn, yawn.</p> <p>But when it happened suddenly everyone burst out singing and dancing and whooping and throwing their New York Yankees base ball caps in the air shouting \"Portillo, Portillo!\" It was briefly cool but it was just a passing fad, a postmodern thing. The madness cooled in no time as the government settled down to do the very dull things it said it would do in the very dull manifesto no one bothered to read.</p> <p>So in the last three years the New Deal unfolded, snatching billions of pounds from the fat cat utilities to rescue 250,000 destitute young people from the scrap heap. Poor families on income support have \u00a31,500 a year more. Child benefit got its biggest rise ever, as did one million poor pensioners who got \u00a320 a week more. Families got 70 a week for childcare. Hereditary peers were removed (well, almost). Today reading and maths levels are rising in primary schools, half of all pupils will go into higher education in 10 years' time and the NHS is about to get more money than it quite knows how to spend. What dull stuff.</p> <p>But still, there's plenty to satisfy the need to complain too. Easy to ponder Blair's cowardice on the euro and proportional representation or his wrong-headedness on freedom of information, asylum seekers, prison numbers and a whole lot more in Jack Straw's domain. Oh yes, there's plenty to keep the old angry fires burning.</p> <p>There will never be a government to please us all. In other words, yes, there are plenty of plausible excuses to vote for Ken.

      "bodyText": "Politics is not fun. Voting tomorrow? Consider then that politics is for making dull things work - making trains and drains run, schools and hospitals work, catching criminals, trading deals with foreigners, preventing poverty, looking after the old and sick. None of that is very exciting. If all worked well we should hire politicians to get on with it the way we hire others to keep the water, gas and electricity flowing, dull stuff unless something goes wrong. Let the politicians plough the fields of administration while the rest of us use our energies on more creative things - making money, bringing up children or communing with a life of the mind, the heart and the arts. The last century saw swathes of humanity hurtled to destruction through investing too much in politics. As God died those who sought the meaning of life in wrap-around political systems soon found themselves crushed to death by the monstrous boa constrictors they had created. Yet we still suffer a hangover from those times, an eerie void. You hear young people yearning nostalgically for the simplicity of the old days with something to fight for. The Spanish civil war was the great ideological adventure holiday of the previous generation. How some of us envied fathers who had been there. As this week marks the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war, you hear some kids saying with longing \"What did you do in the great anti-war demos, ma?\" Well, I say, yes, I was there near the front in Grosvenor Square, face squashed up against a police horse's backside when they burned the flag outside the US embassy. Was it bliss to be alive and so on? No, not now. Now I look back less in anger than embarrassment. Real babies were being napalmed while we in our flares and afghans fought at the battle front against a row of London bobbies (sorry, fascist pigs). What's more, after Kosovo I'm not even sure we were right. Or if we were I am a lot less sure that the Americans were wholly wrong. Any lost war is a war not worth fighting, but maybe there was more nobility in the attempt than we ever considered then. But that's another story - at the time there was a pleasing clarity of vision. Here at the start of a new century there is no shortage of great causes - third world debt, global warming, world trade, starvation, nuclear proliferation - but there is a hole in the heart of politics where ideology used to be. How much duller things are with no God and no isms, how technocratic, run by men and women with no rhetoric (or when foolishly attempted it's a toe-curling anachronism). Still steeped in the old ways, how eagerly they in the Commons and we who comment on them drum up every minor issue, harrumphing and inflating any small thing into some great ism whenever we can. Oh, call back yesterday, bid time return! In this frame of mind the voters of London will elect Ken Livingstone, he who is all our yesterdays personified. Viewed through rose-tinted spectacles, he fell before the wall fell, so much more fun those Maggie v Ken days. Tory and labour tribes alike are giving him their x's for old time's sake. Where's the anger, the clash, the panache now? Hague isn't worth hating, Blair is bland, democracy is bloodless, so vote for fun. Why not? What's the risk? \"Baring their bum at the emperor\" one insider said yesterday glumly. The whole country's in an arsey mood, intent on giving the government a bloody nose. At it's most extreme, it's the mood the eco-rioters caught too as they planted that lovely green punk turf on Sir Winston's head in a gesture far more arresting and imaginative than anything that won the Turner prize in recent years. One way or another a lot of people still want politics to be fun. What a luxury that is, how lucky we are, though at this point to mention Aung San Suu Kyi or Ken Saro Wiwa is like telling children to eat their crusts in the name of the starving of Ethiopia. But here we are with the best government we've had in years and all anyone wants to do is tweak its nose for fun. So secure are these voters in Labour's continuing power that they think they can afford fun and jam on it too. When challenged with their frivolity, Ken voters tend to turn defensive: \"Well it's all Blair's fault. If he hadn't tried his control freakery on London it never would have happened.\" It's a plausible excuse but bunk nonetheless. They'd have voted Ken come what may. They're bored, bored, bored with basically good dull government. When was politics last exciting to these dilettante voters? Why, exactly three years ago on the night of May 1. They were the ones who whinged all through the campaign that they probably wouldn't bother to vote. What's the point? Blair's a Tory, nothing to choose between the parties, yawn, yawn. But when it happened suddenly everyone burst out singing and dancing and whooping and throwing their New York Yankees base ball caps in the air shouting \"Portillo, Portillo!\" It was briefly cool but it was just a passing fad, a postmodern thing. The madness cooled in no time as the government settled down to do the very dull things it said it would do in the very dull manifesto no one bothered to read. So in the last three years the New Deal unfolded, snatching billions of pounds from the fat cat utilities to rescue 250,000 destitute young people from the scrap heap. Poor families on income support have \u00a31,500 a year more. Child benefit got its biggest rise ever, as did one million poor pensioners who got \u00a320 a week more. Families got 70 a week for childcare. Hereditary peers were removed (well, almost). Today reading and maths levels are rising in primary schools, half of all pupils will go into higher education in 10 years' time and the NHS is about to get more money than it quite knows how to spend. What dull stuff. But still, there's plenty to satisfy the need to complain too. Easy to ponder Blair's cowardice on the euro and proportional representation or his wrong-headedness on freedom of information, asylum seekers, prison numbers and a whole lot more in Jack Straw's domain. Oh yes, there's plenty to keep the old angry fires burning. There will never be a government to please us all. In other words, yes, there are plenty of plausible excuses to vote for Ken. All around the metropolis people who should know better wrinkle their noses and say they're sick of Labour, such a disappointment. Voting for Ken will teach Blair a lesson. The real lesson is that even good governments need flashy gestures. It's not enough to plod on with what works in the backroom, the shop window has to dazzle too. Ken knows how easily these jaded fair-weather friends are bought with baubles. So, if you are going to vote Ken, have fun but just don't pretend to be serious as well. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

They used a baseball bat to beat up a 21-year-old Protestant man behind a Salvation Army hall in Lisburn, Co Antrim.

He said: \"The paramilitaries are trying to take over this town. The whole atmosphere is terrible. We are getting out while we still have the chance. Peace? Don't make me laugh.\"</p> <p>Nor is sectarian violence confined to loyalist attacks on Catholics. Protestants and an Orange Hall have been targeted in a recent campaign in Rathfriland, Co Down. Republicans are suspected.</p> <p>And Orangemen in Dublin, who were planning their first march in the Irish capital since 1937, this week called off the event. They said they were subjected to a campaign of sectarian intimidation.</p> <p>Punishment attacks are on the increase again. There are, though, marked differences between the approach of loyalists and republicans.</p> <p>Loyalist attacks have continued steadily. Until April 23 this year, RUC figures show they carried out 19 shootings and 24 assaults, compared with 14 shootings and 43 assaults in the same period last year. There have been several more incidents in the past week. The RUC admits its tally is incomplete.</p> <p>But the IRA stopped all punishment shootings after Sinn Fein issued a strong denunciation of them during George Mitchell's successful review of the agreement last November. While there were five assaults, there was not a single punishment shooting for five months.</p> <p>They began again in March, after Peter Mandelson, Northern Ireland secretary, had suspended the devolved government, and have continued apace.</p> <p>There are suggestions the republican leadership has sanctioned a return to such violence to relieve internal tension over the failing peace process.</p> <p>The RUC's figures for the period to April 23 collate 15 shootings since the resumption seven weeks ago, and 13 assaults. That compares with 12 shootings and 22 assaults in the period up to April 23 last year. The IRA is also believed to have drawn up a death list of five drugs dealers. One assassination bid was foiled last week.</p> <p>Two men from Newry, Co Down, have left after receiving death threats from Direct Action Against Drugs, an IRA front group which killed nine dealers during its 17-month first ceasefire.</p> <p>The IRA last year murdered dealers Brendan Fegan and Paul Downey in the border town.</p> <p>Irish police also fear paramilitary war is close in Dublin. Republicans are suspected over two weekend murders in the city. Each victim was believed to have links to drugs. But they appear to have been murdered because they flouted terrorists' authority.</p> <p>Pat Neville, a father of six, was shot twice in the head on Saturday in an apparent Irish National Liberation Army revenge attack. One of its members, Patrick Campbell, 22, from West Belfast, was butchered in a battle with drugs dealers in West Dublin last October.</p> <p>Tommy Byrne, 41, was killed as he drank with friends on Sunday evening outside a Dublin pub. He had beaten up the IRA's officer-commanding in the city in a fight two years ago, and fled Ireland after he was told he would be killed.</p> <p>Detectives said he returned from Spain recently, after making a financial offer to the IRA leader. He was apparently lulled into believing the deal was acceptable recompense.</p>",

But he decided to risk it and returned for the birth of his daughter, Nicola, now four months old In a bedroom awash with blood, Mr MacDonald's partner, Yolanda Hamilton, who suffered injuries in the attack, said: \"It was unbelievable. They beat him, shot him, and then beat him again with a sledgehammer. He is lucky to be alive.\" His blood drenched the purple carpet and spattered up the walls. Even a bedside photo of Ms Hamilton's son, Paul, six, was smeared. She found him cowering under the bedclothes after the masked men had gone. She said he was traumatised. Loyalists were up to similar law enforcement work. They used a baseball bat to beat up a 21-year-old Protestant man behind a Salvation Army hall in Lisburn, Co Antrim. He suffered a broken arm and leg. A Catholic family was packing up from the estate in Larne, Co Antrim, where they had lived for 27 years, with the Ulster Defence Association suspected of two attacks in as many days. His car was petrol-bombed on Monday, and a nail bomb was thrown at the house yesterday. The UDA blames the father for pulling down its flags, increasingly predominant in even mixed estates in the town. He denied being responsible yesterday, and said he was not prepared to put his partner and his two-year-old son at further risk. He said: \"The paramilitaries are trying to take over this town. The whole atmosphere is terrible. We are getting out while we still have the chance. Peace? Don't make me laugh.\" Nor is sectarian violence confined to loyalist attacks on Catholics. Protestants and an Orange Hall have been targeted in a recent campaign in Rathfriland, Co Down. Republicans are suspected. And Orangemen in Dublin, who were planning their first march in the Irish capital since 1937, this week called off the event. They said they were subjected to a campaign of sectarian intimidation. Punishment attacks are on the increase again. There are, though, marked differences between the approach of loyalists and republicans. Loyalist attacks have continued steadily. Until April 23 this year, RUC figures show they carried out 19 shootings and 24 assaults, compared with 14 shootings and 43 assaults in the same period last year. There have been several more incidents in the past week. The RUC admits its tally is incomplete. But the IRA stopped all punishment shootings after Sinn Fein issued a strong denunciation of them during George Mitchell's successful review of the agreement last November. While there were five assaults, there was not a single punishment shooting for five months. They began again in March, after Peter Mandelson, Northern Ireland secretary, had suspended the devolved government, and have continued apace. There are suggestions the republican leadership has sanctioned a return to such violence to relieve internal tension over the failing peace process. The RUC's figures for the period to April 23 collate 15 shootings since the resumption seven weeks ago, and 13 assaults. That compares with 12 shootings and 22 assaults in the period up to April 23 last year. The IRA is also believed to have drawn up a death list of five drugs dealers. One assassination bid was foiled last week. Two men from Newry, Co Down, have left after receiving death threats from Direct Action Against Drugs, an IRA front group which killed nine dealers during its 17-month first ceasefire. The IRA last year murdered dealers Brendan Fegan and Paul Downey in the border town. Irish police also fear paramilitary war is close in Dublin. Republicans are suspected over two weekend murders in the city. Each victim was believed to have links to drugs. But they appear to have been murdered because they flouted terrorists' authority. Pat Neville, a father of six, was shot twice in the head on Saturday in an apparent Irish National Liberation Army revenge attack. One of its members, Patrick Campbell, 22, from West Belfast, was butchered in a battle with drugs dealers in West Dublin last October. Tommy Byrne, 41, was killed as he drank with friends on Sunday evening outside a Dublin pub. He had beaten up the IRA's officer-commanding in the city in a fight two years ago, and fled Ireland after he was told he would be killed. Detectives said he returned from Spain recently, after making a financial offer to the IRA leader. He was apparently lulled into believing the deal was acceptable recompense.",

Smaller planes and an increased emphasis on the business traveller are the weapons to take the airline forward, BA's board has decided. </p> <p>But a loss of around \u00a3200m does not look good for the airline, and the unions feel that Mr Eddington will wield the cost-cutting axe which Mr Ayling palpably failed to sharpen while he was chief executive. </p> <p>As the new man, Eddington does not have to take the responsibility for the heavy losses, a duty which will fall squarely on the shoulders of BA's chairman, Lord Marshall. Nevertheless, Mr Eddington will very soon have to consider how BA can be raised from the trough into which it has fallen. </p> <p>Mr Ayling once admitted that he had failed to rid BA fully of its old status as a state-owned company, and he quickly backed away from a confrontation with cabin crew which cost BA \u00a3125m in lost revenue. </p> <p>Mr Eddington comes to BA with a more no-nonsense reputation than Mr Ayling enjoyed. He was involved in a cabin crew strike at Cathay in 1993 over working conditions, and he brushed with the pilots in 1994 over expatriate pay. There have also been labour related instances at Ansett. </p> <p>BA has a large staff which will almost certainly have to be reduced over the next five years. Mr Ayling achieved staff cuts largely by early retirement and voluntary redundancy. The unions are worried that Mr Eddington might adopt a tougher approach, at the same time trying to im prove morale, a delicate balancing act. </p> <p>The airline's board and shareholders will see his main task as being to restore profitability and lift the share price, which at least is now comfortably over 300p. City analysts stress that he will also have to deal with BA's debt mountain. Debt is depressing equity returns because of the high interest payments associated with high capital spending and poor cash flow. </p> <p>Mr Eddington became available for the job once it became known that Rupert Murdoch's News Limited had sold its 50% stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand. Lord Marshall wanted somebody in place quickly. In Mr Eddington, he may well have found the ruthless hand in the velvet glove for which he has been looking.</p>",

Smaller planes and an increased emphasis on the business traveller are the weapons to take the airline forward, BA's board has decided. But a loss of around \u00a3200m does not look good for the airline, and the unions feel that Mr Eddington will wield the cost-cutting axe which Mr Ayling palpably failed to sharpen while he was chief executive. As the new man, Eddington does not have to take the responsibility for the heavy losses, a duty which will fall squarely on the shoulders of BA's chairman, Lord Marshall. Nevertheless, Mr Eddington will very soon have to consider how BA can be raised from the trough into which it has fallen. Mr Ayling once admitted that he had failed to rid BA fully of its old status as a state-owned company, and he quickly backed away from a confrontation with cabin crew which cost BA \u00a3125m in lost revenue. Mr Eddington comes to BA with a more no-nonsense reputation than Mr Ayling enjoyed. He was involved in a cabin crew strike at Cathay in 1993 over working conditions, and he brushed with the pilots in 1994 over expatriate pay. There have also been labour related instances at Ansett. BA has a large staff which will almost certainly have to be reduced over the next five years. Mr Ayling achieved staff cuts largely by early retirement and voluntary redundancy. The unions are worried that Mr Eddington might adopt a tougher approach, at the same time trying to im prove morale, a delicate balancing act. The airline's board and shareholders will see his main task as being to restore profitability and lift the share price, which at least is now comfortably over 300p. City analysts stress that he will also have to deal with BA's debt mountain. Debt is depressing equity returns because of the high interest payments associated with high capital spending and poor cash flow. Mr Eddington became available for the job once it became known that Rupert Murdoch's News Limited had sold its 50% stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand. Lord Marshall wanted somebody in place quickly. In Mr Eddington, he may well have found the ruthless hand in the velvet glove for which he has been looking.",

WPP yesterday confirmed that its discussions with Y&amp;R had broken down over the weekend and the US group, which has frustrated investors by its lacklustre share price, may find itself under increasing pressure to do a deal. A strongly worded addendum to the Publicis statement suggested that any conclusion of the discussions is some way off. \"Rumours of an imminent agreement are premature\" it said suggesting that the alternative to the WPP deal is less secure than Y&amp;R would like. Sir Martin is understood to have been angered by last minute demands made by Y&amp;R including a clause which would have granted the business autonomy from WPP for another year. Shares in WPP yesterday closed down 35p at \u00a310. Publicis sources said the French group was under no pressure to do a deal because of the strong growth of the business. It has grown aggressively through acquisition and last year profits increased by 42%. \"We have good reason to hope that things move forward but we are just at the beginning of the process,\" said one insider. WPP is understood to not have ruled out a return to the negotiating table. A pairing of Publicis and Y&amp;R could cause difficulties of client conflict, most notably between Ford, a client of the US group, and Renault, a key client of the French, though consolidation in the industry has caused some large advertisers to reduce their opposition to such conflicts.",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has criticised a charity appeal for toy donations for children of asylum seekers, saying it is based on a serious misunderstanding of the asylum voucher system. More than eight boxfuls of toys have been received by the National Asylum Support Service (Nass) in response to the appeal by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. The appeal was launched after it became clear that the new asylum regulations meant toys were not included in the official definition of \"essential living needs\" when the Home Office calculated that a child under 16 needed \u00a326.60 a week. The charity world fears that Mr Straw will start counting the value of donations to asylum seekers in the form of clothes, pots and pans, school uniforms and travelling expenses against their weekly voucher allowance, and deduct the value of these items from the allowance. Neil Gerrard, Labour MP for Walthamstow and chairman of the Commons all party group on refugees, has tabled an early day motion calling on MPs to support the appeal. The Nass headquarters in Croydon, south London, has set up special arrangements to pass the toys on to asylum seekers. Mr Straw has written to Helen Bamber of the medical foundation to say that it is a serious misunderstanding to believe his measures \"deprive the children of asylum seekers\". He said: \"The regulations point out that toys are not to be treated as essential living needs. That provision is to ensure that families are not regarded as destitute simply because they cannot afford toys \"It does not prevent asylum seekers from purchasing toys with their vouchers/cash.

      "bodyText": "The appeal court is likely to face a flood of applications to reopen cases after the European court of human rights in Strasbourg ruled yesterday that two drug addicts who refused to answer questions in the police station were denied a fair trial. The Strasbourg court ruled that the judges who threw out an appeal by William and Karen Codron against their convictions for supplying heroin were wrong to take it upon themselves to decide that their conviction was safe even though the trial judge's direction to the jury was defective. The ruling means that the appeal court can no longer follow its longstanding practice of putting itself in the jury's place and deciding that the judge's error would have made no difference to the verdict. If the judge's directions to the jury are not adequate, the appeal court cannot correct them but must quash the conviction. The couple were convicted in 1995 and sentenced to four years in prison for supplying heroin after police observed them passing packages to their next-door neighbour in their south London council block across the balcony which joined the two flats. When they were taken to the police station they refused to answer questions on the advice of their solicitor, who argued that they were not fit to be questioned because they were suffering heroin withdrawal symptoms. The doctor who examined them at the station disagreed. At the trial the jury was told why they had not answered police questions. The judge directed the jury that they could draw \"adverse inferences\" from their silence under questioning even if they accepted the defendants' reasons for not answering the questions. The appeal court criticised this direction but nevertheless ruled that the conviction was safe. The seven Strasbourg judges unanimously held that the couple's right to a fair trial was violated, and ordered the UK government to pay \u00a315,000 for their costs and expenses. They said the court had \"no means of ascertaining whether or not the applicants' silence paid a significant role in the jury's decision to convict\". Since juries did not give reasons for convicting \"it was impossible to ascertain what weight, if any, was given to the applicants' silence\". The jury should have been directed that it should draw an adverse inference only if it believed the defendants had no answer or none that would stand up to cross-examination. Since the jury was not properly directed, the imperfection in the direction could not be remedied on appeal. Mary Cuneen, associate director of the human rights group Liberty, which backed the Strasbourg application, said: \"The judgment affirms the fundamental importance of the right to silence in the criminal trial process. Any attempts to erode this right must be treated with the utmost caution. \"In future, courts will have to be extremely careful in drawing inferences. \"The court of appeal will have to change its approach when considering appeals to consider not only whether the conviction as a whole is safe but also whether it is fair in terms of article 6 [of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial].\" Inroads on the right of silence brought in by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 have proved a minefield for judges and are bound to provoke a wave of challenges in the English courts once the Human Rights Act comes into force next October. Before then suspects had an absolute right to refuse to answer questions either in the police station or in court, but the act allowed juries to draw adverse inferences from silence in appropriate circumstances. The human rights court held in 1996 that silence is not an absolute right, but another four cases on how far safeguards must extend are pending in Strasbourg.",

A survey of 420 baby foods, which compared jars, chilled and dried baby foods made by leading manufacturers, found that nearly 40% of all foods contained sugar or fruit juice and 60% of breakfast cereals contained added sugars. Which? the association's magazine, also found that a further 40% contained starch additives which can stop food separating. Because they absorb water, some critics believe that starch additives are used to bulk out the food. In addition, six savoury meals were found to contain glucose syrup, a form of sugar. Breakfasts by leading brands such as Farleys and Milupa were sweetened with added sugar, while dried meals by Sainsbury's and Boots contained starches. Which? highlighted the Baby Organix and Simply Organic Baby Food from the Original Fresh Babyfood Company as not containing any starches or sugars. The survey also found that some products had meaningless phrases on their labels such as \"specially formulated\" and \"wholesome ingredients\", while others, such as some fruit yoghurts, were found to contain only fruit flavouring. Government health guidelines recommend that baby food should usually be free from, or low in sugars, including those from fruit juice. Graham Jacobs, the editor of Which? said: \"Bought baby foods are convenient and easy to use, but should be part of a mixed weaning diet that includes home-made foods. In our comparison of brands we found a lot of added sugars and starches.\" He added: \"Check ingredients carefully to see exactly what you're getting. Our results show it's clearly worth comparing brands and ranges.\" The report urges mothers and fathers to prepare home- made baby food whenever they can so they can control what goes into it. A report from the food commission found earlier this year that small children's teeth are at risk from some biscuits specially designed for babies and toddlers. The report found that the biscuits are sweeter than jam tarts or doughnuts and urged parents to look carefully at the small print and ignore the highly sweetened brands. The food commission survey found 50% sugar in Nestle Fruit Stick and 37% in Boots Teddy Bear biscuits, compared with 36% in a jam tart. Traditional Farley's Rusks were found to have more sugar than a chocolate digestive.",

Its chief executive, John Woodward, said the new body, launched yesterday to oversee the spending of \u00a350m a year of lottery and government money, would make no apologies for concentrating on commercial films. \"We are interested in films that really can play in cinemas on a Friday night, and we will not be backing films whose natural home is on television,\" he said. Council chairman Alan Parker, the director of Evita and Angela's Ashes, said the \"little Englander\" mentality had to be ditched if \"we are to move away from the cottage industry that we all currently work in\". He said the industry had to embrace Hollywood backers and also work more closely with European producers, who were increasingly moving into English-language film and seeing Britain as a bridge into the American market. The British Screen office in Los Angeles, which tries to lure American films to shoot in the UK, was being expanded, he said, and \u00a34.2m will be set aside to help European co-productions. Nearly half of the \u00a322m the council will invest, however, will go into 10 to 12 populist British films a year. Mr Woodward said the council could invest up to \u00a38m in a single project if they thought it was good enough. A further \u00a36m will go into script development and into improving the \"patchy\" training industry writers and executives now get. Even so \u00a35m - more than twice what the British Film Institute was previously allowed to spend - will be set aside for encouraging arthouse films and bringing on new talent. Last night the first phase of the council's plans to restructure its support for the industry was welcomed by film-makers. Charles Harris of the New Producers Alliance, which rep resents independent film-makers, said it still had reservations, particularly over the small number of executives who will determine what films were made. \"It is a two rather than three cheers situation.

The recruit, Nathaniel Burton, drowned in October 1998 while crossing Crazy Well Pool on Dartmoor with other members of 748 troop from the commando training centre, Lympstone, Devon. He had been on the 30-week training course, which is considered to be one of the toughest in the world, for 11 weeks. At an inquest in March 1999 coroner Brian Hall-Tomkin recorded a verdict of accidental death on the teenager, who was crossing the pool with a buoyancy aid made from his rucksack wrapped in a poncho. The coroner said at the hearing that Lieutenant Nathan Martin, who was commander of 748 troop, did not have to read his statement aloud as investigations into the incident were under way. The MoD said yesterday that no proceedings, internal or external, would be taken against Lt Martin - who is now a captain - or anyone else following a \"full and detailed\" investigation. A spokesman said: \"The evidence in the investigation has all been carefully considered by the crown prosecution service, the health and safety executive and the internal prosecuting authority to see if there was any evidence for a prosecution against any individual, and the answer was no.\" Mr Burton's mother, Lynne Kellow, from Bradninch, east Devon, said after the inquest that she did not blame anyone for her son's death. He had always wanted to be a Royal Marine and they all knew training had to be hard to achieve the green beret, she said. \"There is no way we want to point the finger of blame at anybody,\" said Mrs Kellow. \"We have no doubt that the training as it stands is entirely necessary.

      "bodyText": "Great Ormond Street hospital has obtained a high court injunction to stop a man entering its grounds or harassing doctors who cared for his son before he died aged 16. Barry Suddell, whose son Jay died in 1996, faces a fine or a jail sentence if he enters the hospital, and has also been told not to distribute posters and leaflets as part of a campaign accusing doctors of manslaughter and conspiracy. The hospital went to the high court after Mr Suddell entered its cardiac unit in March and shouted abuse at staff and patients. He is also alleged to have threatened and taken photographs of the four doctors who treated his son during the two weeks he received treatment before his death. The hospital obtained the injunction against Mr Suddell, from Rainham, Essex, on March 20. Jay, who was born with a congenital heart defect which occurs in about four of every 10,000 births, underwent heart surgery at Great Ormond Street as a baby in 1980. He was readmitted to the hospital in 1996 after he began coughing blood, but died 12 days later after surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital yesterday denied reports that the trust and the doctors - John Deanfield, a cardiologist, James Taylor, a consultant paediatric cardiologist, Ian James, a consultant anaes thetist and Robert Yates, a paediatric intensive care consultant - were planning to sue him for damages. She said: \"The hospital has tried to help this man and we have carried out thorough investigations into his case more than once over the years, which have found nothing wrong in the way his son was treated.\" She added: \"We have a counselling service to help families in these situations, but it was felt this man had gone too far.

Although commission insiders stressed that Emma Udwin, a former BBC political journalist, will also help other commissioners to be more media-friendly, they admit that Mr Prodi needs special help. \"It's true that he is not a Bill Clinton-style communicator but a professor who speaks in a discursive way,\" a source said. \"He's not the world's most natural communicator.\" A television news editor in Brussels was less diplomatic. \"We told him that he had 60 seconds to describe the EU's enlargement process, but at the end of 60 seconds he had barely finished introducing himself. It was a disaster.\" Mr Prodi's rather faltering English is also an issue, others say, but the real problem is that he addresses the media as if he were lecturing his former students in Bologna. In a world where soundbites can make or break a politician's image, Mr Prodi's delivery is not good enough. \"Without a clear script he tends to ramble and go off at a tangent. This means that whatever message the commission is trying to get across is diluted,\" an EU diplomat commented. Ms Udwin will have to make sure that he keeps his foot out of his mouth in television interviews. As a Briton with experience of EU affairs, she will be aware that past talk of a European army and calling the commission a \"European government\" had Eurosceptics in Britain foaming at the mouth.",

      "bodyText": "Abu Sayyaf rebels threatened to behead two of the foreign tourists among the 21 hostages they are holding in the hills of Jolo island yesterday if the Philippine army, which has surrounded them, does not pull back its troops. Yesterday about 100 armed rebels tried to break through the military cordon. At least one soldier was killed and six wounded, a spokesman, Colonel Hilario Atendido, said. The fighting was continuing yesterday evening, the police said. There was no immediate word of rebel casualties. Nur Misuari, the government's hostage negotiator, said that the army had told him that their encirclement of the area would remain in place. The 21 hostages, who were kidnapped last Sunday from Sipadan, a Malaysian diving resort, have pleaded with the government to halt military operations in the area. Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two rebel groups fighting for a separate Islamic state in the impoverished Mindanao region. Government troops were also involved in clashes yesterday with members of the larger group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), who occupied a main road near their base camp in central Mindanao. Officials said the bodies of about 70 MILF guerrillas had been recovered. Announcing the threat to behead two hostages, Abu Escobar, an Abu Sayyaf leader, said the troops had moved so close to the hideout that the kidnappers could see them. If the government did not pull back the soldiers, \"We will surprise them,\" he said in an interview with a local radio station. \"Maybe two heads for tomorrow.\" Another group of Abu Sayyaf rebels, who are holding 27 hostages on the nearby island of Basilan, claimed two weeks ago that they had beheaded two of their captives, triggering a military assault on their stronghold. So far the army has failed to find the hostages. The Jolo hostages wrote to their embassies on Monday asking them to put pressure on the Philippine government to speed up the negotiations and remove the troops, in order to prevent further clashes and allow the kidnappers to obtain food. Journalists who accompanied a doctor on Monday to the bamboo hut housing them were told by the hostages that they were suffering food shortages, fevers and infections. The doctor later reported that most of the hostages were exhausted and dehydrated. She said she had told the rebels that two of their captives need to be in hospital. About 70 heavily armed guerrillas, their faces masked, guarded the area, about 45 minutes up a rugged path from the nearest road in Talipao. The hostages include tourists from Germany, France, South Africa, Finland and Lebanon, and resort workers from the Philippines and Malaysia. Mr Misuari said the rebels refused to begin formal talks unless the troops were moved from the area. \"They are demanding that government forces must withdraw from their present position to a safe distance,\" he said. \"And as soon as that happens they are ready to open talks with me.\" On Basilan, the army admitted yesterday that it was unable to find the 27 hostages after overrunning the main Abu Sayyaf stronghold.

The pledge by Britain, France, the US, Russia and China was issued on Monday night at the non-proliferation treaty review in New York, in an attempt to deflect critics who say they have failed to cut their arsenals quickly enough and negotiate in good faith to achieve the treaty's goal of a nuclear-free world. The five promised their \"unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals of a complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international controls\".

Hubert de la Fortelle, representing France at the conference, defended the statement by pointing in particular to a section that said none of the five was aiming its nuclear weapons at any specific state.

The statement also called for the \"preserving and strengthening\" of the 1972 US-Russian anti-ballistic-missile treaty. Yet Washington is trying to persuade Moscow to amend the treaty so that the US can build a national anti-missile shield. It says this is to protect it against \"rogue\" states such as North Korea. Javier Solana, the EU's coordinator for foreign and defence policy, made it clear that Europe was concerned about the US plans. \"If we feel we are not defended it may risk the beginning of decoupling,\" he said after talks with the Clinton administration about the US-European alliance. Britain's UN representative, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said the nuclear five's statement - the first of its kind - was designed to \"boost momentum\" at the four-week conference. But Admiral Ramu Ramdas, a former commander of the Indian navy and a campaigner against nuclear weapons, called the statement a \"damage control exercise by the nuclear states - nothing new at all.\" Without a framework or schedule, he said, the statement had no meaning. Dan Plesch, director of the British American Security Information Council, a research organisation, said the statement contradicted leaked Washington proposals. Documents described by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as draft Washington proposals call for the US and Russia to have \"large diversified, viable arsenals of strategic offensive weapons\" that enable them to deploy missiles with nuclear warheads \"over the next decade and thereafter\". Greenpeace argued that the joint statement would heighten concern about nuclear arms by showing that the five's action on disarmament would be limited to platitudes. Rebecca Johnson, director of the Acronym Institute, a disarmament thinktank, accused the five of \"using buzzwords of 'unequivocal commitment' in the hopes that no one notices that they're not committed to the elimination of nuclear weapons any time soon\". Dave Knight, chairman of CND, said: \"We have been waiting 30 years for the nuclear weapons states to fulfil their obligations under the NPT [non-proliferation treaty] and they are calling it their 'ultimate goal'. \"How much longer do we have to wait until we get to 'ultimate'?\" Members of the New Agenda Coalition, a group of seven countries - including South Africa, Japan, and Mexico - pressing for specific commitments to nuclear disarmament, accused the five of not going far enough.

All workers covered by the directive will have the right to the same hourly rates as comparable full-timers, as well as the same access to training and pro rata holiday, maternity and paternity entitlements. Under government estimates, some 400,000 part timers currently suffering discrimination will be able to demand a better deal. Trade and industry sources say \"hundreds of thousands\" more people will be covered by including all part-time workers rather than merely employees. The concession was last night welcomed as \"good news\" by TUC sources, who have argued that workers suffering most discrimination would otherwise be excluded from new rights under the European directive. However, unions will be disappointed that the government has rejected a further demand that part-time workers in jobs with no full-time equivalent should have a means of definining what rights a comparable full-timer would be entitled to. The TUC argues that , because workers such as dinner ladies and cleaners are almost always employed part-time., they will not be able to point to full-time colleagues and demand the same rights. The government has dug in its heels, arguing that in reality few businesses exist where all workers carrying out one job are part-timers. \"These are rare cases,\" said a DTI source. \"It was felt that the change would be overkill. We are trying to get the right balance here.\" A CBI spokeswoman said extending the definition of people covered to include temporary and agency workers as well as employees was \"unnecessary\". But she said the decision not to force companies to come up with a full-time comparison where some roles were only part-time was \"a victory for the CBI\".",

The plot drifts from the devious to downright muddled, but there are lots of plusses: an engaging, oddball collection of characters, including an armed and dangerous Andie MacDowell, cop-cum-movie buff Loren Dean, stuntwoman Traci Lind and a shady Gabriel Byrne; a typically haunting Ry Cooder score, and a beautiful noir look, courtesy of cinematographer Pascal Rabaud.</p>",

      "bodyText": "...And Justice For All (Norman Jewison, 1979) 9pm, 3.30am, Carlton Cinema Al Pacino is a crusading lawyer who takes on a series of cases, including that of a judge charged with rape. Scripted by Barry Levinson and Valerie Curtin, the film aims to expose a murky world of plea-bargaining, with a few laughs along the way, but it cries out for a more forensic examination. Cube (Vincenzo Natali, 1997) 10pm, Sky MovieMax Six strangers wake up one morning to find themselves trapped in a cube. They try to leave, only to find themselves in another. And another. A crafty, one-set, low-budget sci-fi, which, though never quite capitalising on the premise, still has a Rubik's-like pull. Mystery Train (Jim Jarmusch, 1989) 10.10pm, FilmFour A Grand Hotel portmanteau movie for the landless and dispossessed. It's set in a seedy Memphis hotel where Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Cinqu\u00e9 Lee provide an hilarious, abrasive chorus to three tales: Far From Yokohama is about a pair of Japanese Elvis fans on a pilgrimage to the King's grave; Ghost concerns an Italian widow, her husband's coffin, and a garrulous young American woman; Lost In Space has punk Joe Strummer out boozing and shooting with Steve Buscemi and Rick Aviles: all finally interlocking in Jarmusch's charming, chaotic order of things. The End of Violence (Wim Wenders, 1997) 1.25am, Sky MovieMax One of Wenders's stylish and enthralling American sojourns, an LA-set thriller in which Bill Pullman's shlock movie producer goes into hiding with a Mexican family after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt. The plot drifts from the devious to downright muddled, but there are lots of plusses: an engaging, oddball collection of characters, including an armed and dangerous Andie MacDowell, cop-cum-movie buff Loren Dean, stuntwoman Traci Lind and a shady Gabriel Byrne; a typically haunting Ry Cooder score, and a beautiful noir look, courtesy of cinematographer Pascal Rabaud.",

Or you can reflect on Joseph M Brogan III and his lesson to us all.</p> <p>When the Diary offered \u00a3150 to the first reader to be photographed with Frank Dobson in an Oooh You Amaze Me! T-shirt, this hard-up student crytallised the can-do spirit that has made the US what it is. He discovered that Dobbo was doing an on-line appearance at the Guardian, laid in wait for him outside this mesmerically hideous building . . . and pounced. Behold! \"I got the shot by just asking him really,\" says the Third. \"It was a fun experience. He knew about the contest and I think he was happy to get it over with!\" We wish Joseph III a safe journey home later this month, and congratulate him for putting all those feckless, bone-idle British students to shame.</p> <p>\u0095After yesterday's excitement when her \"burgeoning assets\" popped out at her 16th birthday, we need a day to recover before the next extract from <a href=\"http://www.ruthgledhill.com.\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ruthgledhill.com.</a> However, it must be noted that the Times's religion correspondent now includes the following on her site. \"Ruth's homepage wins its first award! ... Guardian Diary Website of the Month!\"</p> <p>\u0095I am surprised to note that, even while working \"night and day\" to save Rover jobs, Mr Tony Blair found time over the weekend to construct a 975-word hand-written letter of self-justification to the Sun, which has been beastly about him. How odd. For five years, this Diary has been in less than complete accord with Mr T . . . and not a word!</p> <p>My colleague Richard Adams rings Downing Street to ask - and say what you will, we are not greedy - for a postcard. A long sigh ensues. \"It must be a very, very thin day on the Guardian Diary, that's all I can say,\" says some insolent pup who refuses to give his name. \"Cheerio.\"</p> <p>\u0095Elsewhere in the Sun, my old friend Richard Littlejohn is obsessed with the convicted murderer Tony Martin, whom he apparently views as a hero in the mould of a granite-jawed homesteader played by Alan Ladd. Tremendous stuff. Richard became so carried away in explaining why it is correct to shoot in the back anyone poised to steal their ornaments that he forgot to mention being the recent victim of a burglary himself. Could you make it up? Perhaps, but would you have the energy?</p> <p>\u0095There is nothing sadder than a one-issue politician, so it is good to see Dr Evan Harris refusing to become fixated on his job as Lib Dem spokesman on women's affairs. Evan has written to the leader of the Lords about a parliamentary chess match he is trying to set up. \"Dear Lord Jay,\" it begins.</p> <p>\u0095In succession to the BMW, the next Diary car will be a Rover 75.

      "bodyText": "\u0095Anyone who remains baffled as to how America has become the world's dominant military, economic and cultural power has two simple choices open to them. You can either sit down and attempt to make sense of Paul Johnson's A History of the American People, in which my sane and rational friend translates ich bin ein Berliner as \"I am a hamburger\". Or you can reflect on Joseph M Brogan III and his lesson to us all. When the Diary offered \u00a3150 to the first reader to be photographed with Frank Dobson in an Oooh You Amaze Me! T-shirt, this hard-up student crytallised the can-do spirit that has made the US what it is. He discovered that Dobbo was doing an on-line appearance at the Guardian, laid in wait for him outside this mesmerically hideous building . . . and pounced. Behold! \"I got the shot by just asking him really,\" says the Third. \"It was a fun experience. He knew about the contest and I think he was happy to get it over with!\" We wish Joseph III a safe journey home later this month, and congratulate him for putting all those feckless, bone-idle British students to shame. \u0095After yesterday's excitement when her \"burgeoning assets\" popped out at her 16th birthday, we need a day to recover before the next extract from www.ruthgledhill.com. However, it must be noted that the Times's religion correspondent now includes the following on her site. \"Ruth's homepage wins its first award! ... Guardian Diary Website of the Month!\" \u0095I am surprised to note that, even while working \"night and day\" to save Rover jobs, Mr Tony Blair found time over the weekend to construct a 975-word hand-written letter of self-justification to the Sun, which has been beastly about him. How odd. For five years, this Diary has been in less than complete accord with Mr T . . . and not a word! My colleague Richard Adams rings Downing Street to ask - and say what you will, we are not greedy - for a postcard. A long sigh ensues. \"It must be a very, very thin day on the Guardian Diary, that's all I can say,\" says some insolent pup who refuses to give his name. \"Cheerio.\" \u0095Elsewhere in the Sun, my old friend Richard Littlejohn is obsessed with the convicted murderer Tony Martin, whom he apparently views as a hero in the mould of a granite-jawed homesteader played by Alan Ladd. Tremendous stuff. Richard became so carried away in explaining why it is correct to shoot in the back anyone poised to steal their ornaments that he forgot to mention being the recent victim of a burglary himself. Could you make it up? Perhaps, but would you have the energy? \u0095There is nothing sadder than a one-issue politician, so it is good to see Dr Evan Harris refusing to become fixated on his job as Lib Dem spokesman on women's affairs. Evan has written to the leader of the Lords about a parliamentary chess match he is trying to set up. \"Dear Lord Jay,\" it begins. \u0095In succession to the BMW, the next Diary car will be a Rover 75. At least we hope it will. Early efforts to contact the press office fail when no one answers the phone. Few are immune from complacency during times of unusual stability, it's true, but it's a poor show when we're trying to do our patriotic duty.",

Tamil Tiger rebels took control of the key Elephant Pass military base on the northern Jaffna peninsula on April 22; the base had never before fallen to the rebels. Eight days later the Tigers consolidated their hold on the peninsula when they captured another crucial military base, at Pallai.

The military said 14 officers and soldiers were killed and 222 others were wounded. The rebel's clandestine Voice of Tigers Radio maintained yesterday that only 10 of their combatants died. Independent verification was impossible.",

In fact Latcho Drom is a film that, as American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum put it, \"has no nationality at all\". It is also a film without fixed genre: at once musical, documentary, travelogue, ethnographic essay and impassioned manifesto for a freer cinema and a freer life. </p> <p>Gatlif's 1997 film Gadjo Dilo was a portrait of a Romanian gypsy village, ostensibly seen through the eyes of a French outsider, but really offering a community-eye view of his strangeness - the Frenchman being the \"crazy foreigner\" of the title. Update for Gadjo Dilo fans: Gatlif's follow-up, Children of the Stork, is a messy, apparently semi-improvised caper with a heavy nod to Godard, and is borderline unwatchable, except for one memorable gag about a film critic who literally rubber-stamps movies: \"Rubbish\", \"Masterpiece\", \" Absolute masterpiece\". </p> <p>But Latcho Drom (1993) is, it is probably fair to say, unlike any film you will have seen. An impressionistic picture of the migrations of the gypsy peoples and musics through time and space, it is constructed as a series of musical interludes. It has hundreds, maybe thousands of characters, but the central character is the protean gypsy population itself. The whole film is staged as a single staggered journey from east to west: the wedding revellers in Rajasthan seem to evolve into the family taking a ferry to Istanbul, then into the band waiting for a train in Hungary. The Rajasthan sequence, lit by fires burning in tree trunks, is presented like a recollection of a distant Edenic past. From then on, it's clear that everything is a response to grief and exclusion. An old woman walks across a snowy landscape in Slovakia, and sings about the population wiped out in the Holocaust. The Romanian band Taraf de Ha\u00efdouks sing about the crimes of Ceausescu. The film ends with a woman's lament on a Spanish hillside, overlooking an urban landscape as barren as, but less hospitable than the Rajasthan desert. </p> <p>Taraf de Ha\u00efdouks' concert at the Barbican the other night was a good metaphor for Latcho Drom's fluidity, and for the way that gypsy culture evolves throughout the film. The 12 members play in every conceivable combination - en masse, in threes, fours or fives, swapping accordions, violins and double basses, and playing with an extraordinary, controlled frenzy. The band comes in different permutations, but always plays with the same collective signature; the film covers different gypsy cultures, but always implies a unity. </p> <p>Latcho Drom can be seen as a history lesson: the Barbican season, and Gatlif's film in particular, make a timely retort to Britain's latest wave of xenophobia. You might argue that Latcho Drom is romantic and impressionistic, that it doesn't offer commentary or analysis, but simply presents gypsy culture as some sort of eternal spirit. But for a film that barely deals in the spoken word, Latcho Drom conveys a very concrete sense of historical reality. And the fact that the film exists at all, flouting genres and national barriers, is of no small political importance. Its title means \"safe journey\": Latcho Drom is, you could say, the ultimate road movie. </p> <p>Latcho Drom opens at the Barbican Cinema, London EC2, on Friday.

      "body": "<p>Vikram Seth centred his latest novel, An Equal Music, on a string quartet. It was just the way to follow up his mammoth family drama A Suitable Boy, drawing on the close yet precarious relationships that exist within quartets. The ties between members are often compared to marriages; quartets are even given \"family\" names - the Emersons, the Lindsays, the Vellingers - in the shorthand of the music world. Quartet musicians spend a vast amount of time with their colleagues - on the road, rehearsing, bickering, taking and doling out criticism. </p> <p>This month the Wigmore Hall and the Barbican will play host to one of the most successful groups, the New York-based Emerson Quartet, for a season covering all of Shostakovich's string quartets. Taking its name from the American poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, the Emerson Quartet dates back to 1976. Violinists Philip Setzer and Eugene Drucker both studied at the Julliard School under Oscar Shumsky, where they formed the Emersons. The present line-up, with violist Lawrence Dutton and cellist David Finckel replacing two members of the original four, was established in 1980. \"They tried out 17 violists and one cellist,\" says Dutton. There's a viola joke in there somewhere - but then jokes about viola players are the music world's stock-in-trade. </p> <p>Watching the four talk together gives an inkling of why they work so well as a group.

      "bodyText": "Vikram Seth centred his latest novel, An Equal Music, on a string quartet. It was just the way to follow up his mammoth family drama A Suitable Boy, drawing on the close yet precarious relationships that exist within quartets. The ties between members are often compared to marriages; quartets are even given \"family\" names - the Emersons, the Lindsays, the Vellingers - in the shorthand of the music world. Quartet musicians spend a vast amount of time with their colleagues - on the road, rehearsing, bickering, taking and doling out criticism. This month the Wigmore Hall and the Barbican will play host to one of the most successful groups, the New York-based Emerson Quartet, for a season covering all of Shostakovich's string quartets. Taking its name from the American poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, the Emerson Quartet dates back to 1976. Violinists Philip Setzer and Eugene Drucker both studied at the Julliard School under Oscar Shumsky, where they formed the Emersons. The present line-up, with violist Lawrence Dutton and cellist David Finckel replacing two members of the original four, was established in 1980. \"They tried out 17 violists and one cellist,\" says Dutton. There's a viola joke in there somewhere - but then jokes about viola players are the music world's stock-in-trade. Watching the four talk together gives an inkling of why they work so well as a group. No one person dominates the conversation; nobody talks over anyone else. They joke and banter and spark off each other irrepressibly. Not all quartets work out so well. And when there's a split, the divorce can be messy. One young British quartet turned to the Musicians' Union for arbitration after the first violinist decided to leave. The leader took on the other three over the ownership of the quartet's name, a valuable asset associating it with a well-known 20th-century composer.

      "body": "<p> In a poky teacher's office in Quinton Kynaston School, north-west London, playwright Diane Samuels is keeping calm. This is the last of her four sessions with a quartet of fresh-faced ingenues due to submit scripts for performance at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, in the heart of the West End. But two scripts haven't appeared, one of them because of a greater creative project - its writer's first baby. The other two have been penned, read aloud, and now - as diplomatically as can be - Samuels is suggesting rewrites. \"Plays,\" she intones, speaking perhaps from bitter experience, \"are rewritten, not written.\" Her young charges grumble their resistance. </p> <p>This is Playwrite, a project organised as part of the Masterclass strand of activities that has run at the Haymarket since 1998. Four playwrights have been sent to schools in London and beyond to supervise the writing of 30-minute plays by A-level students. The results are to be performed by cast members from the theatre's current production Miss Julie, before a panel of writers and critics and an invited audience this weekend. </p> <p>\"It's very limited, what you can achieve with four sessions with people you've never met before,\" says Samuels, the writer of the much-praised Kindertransport. \"All you can do is begin a journey.\" So she is doing her best to streamline the work of her writers-to-be. All four plays have been conceived along epic lines, and their writers are unwilling to scale them down. \"Less is more,\" Samuels suggests. \"Have you heard that phrase?\" </p> <p>The quartet of writers - all female - have little theatrical and even less literary experience. They do drama classes, that's all. It's fascinating to see them attempting to shape their world in literary terms. \"When I was writing,\" says Lizzie, who has penned a piece reflecting her own Christianity, \"I knew I had to end with a moral message: what am I trying to say?\" Samuels has to chip away at their sense that their plays should provide all the answers. That includes paring back the stage directions. \"Don't tell the director what to do,\" she advises - and then, putting herself in their shoes, adds, \"I think you can tell the director what to do, but you have to do it covertly.\" </p> <p>The idea is to weld the four scripts into a dramatic whole. It's proving tricky. Lizzie has written a dramatic defence of Christian forgiveness. In Kelly's play, a dentist gouges out his patient's tongue. Meron wants to write about the 19th-century feminist abolitionist Sojourner Truth, and Valentina plans something about Kosovo. Four disparate ideas in search of a common thread. Samuels thinks she's got it: \"Your characters are all in the midst of a struggle.\" Hmm. The kids don't buy it. </p> <p>\"In the end,\" Samuels says some weeks later, \"they decided they wanted to do their individual pieces and not join together. There was a shift over four weeks, from wanting to be in a group to actually standing out and saying, 'No, I want to tell my story'.\" </p> <p>Samuels was uneasy, however, about encouraging teenagers into her beleaguered profession. \"The theatre business doesn't have much scope to produce work. It's very competitive. You have to develop incredible resources to survive it. There's all this money put into theatres dedicated to new writing, but what about further down the line - five or 10 years after they've found the new voice and the new play? What they do is they look for the next new voice and the next new play. Where does everyone else go? What's nice about this project is that it's not about finding material for a theatre to produce.\" </p> <p>If Playwrite were organised by the Royal Court, nobody would bat an eyelid. But it is run by a commercial West End theatre that is family-owned, isn't subsidised and doesn't produce shows of its own. \"There's no continuity about Playwrite or sense of something that's going to go on for a long time,\" says Samuels. \"It has an eccentric, slightly philanthropic feel to it.\" </p> <p>If anyone can explain that, it's Haymarket chairman Arnold Crook, who set up Masterclass with Peter Hall. He insists, with a seraphic expression on his face, that \"this is a pure operation for young people. There's no financial gain for this theatre, nothing but the thought of young people in the theatre.\" He admits that he devised Masterclass to persuade lottery funders that his theatre had an education policy. But when his lottery application was denied, the project went ahead regardless. </p> <p>An unlikely evangelist for the \"magic\" of theatre, the sharp-suited Crook dreams of the day when a play conceived by Masterclass students is given a professional production at the Haymarket. Sunday evening is a stepping stone; whatever the quality of the plays themselves, the writers' faces are full of drama as they see their work come alive for the first time. \"Young people shouldn't feel intimidated coming into the theatre,\" says Crook. \"I think Masterclass opens the door for them. I love to stand at the back and look at the kids' faces: their eyes open, their mouths open, they can't believe the beauty of this place. This is our lifeblood, this is the future of all theatres.\"</p>",

Is there anyone in the audience who was in Auschwitz, or whose grandmother was in Auschwitz?</p> <p>On the eve of the day when normal life in Israel is suspended while the country mourns the 6m Jews killed by the Nazis, the \"Alternative Holocaust Memorial\" reached out to a younger generation overwhelmed by the enormity of the genocide yet alienated from the official ceremonies which dominate the day.</p> <p>The line-up included a gossip columnist, a stand-up comic, and, perhaps most unusually for a secular occasion, an undertaker from an Orthodox Jewish burial society. The venue was equally unconventional: the crowded, smoky Barbie Club, a converted garage in an industrial district of south Tel Aviv.</p> <p>While Nazi newsreels played as a backdrop and the bells of railway crossings clanged, the performers and the packed audience of 250 - mainly in their 20s and early 30s - struggled to find meaning in an experience that is central to the Jewish state but remains beyond the comprehension of many of this generation.</p> <p>\"Maybe what we need is something like those weekend supplements: 100 things you never knew about Hitler,\" said Eliat Alkayam, in her cynical opening act. The comic, Rotem Itach-Ashbel, read from the diary of Anne Frank while chewing two shiny red apples - intended, she said, to show the Dutch teenager's undiminished desire while she was in hiding.</p> <p>The undertaker told of his three-day experiment in eating only crusts of bread to feel the hunger which the Jews had suffered. He explained that, in his line of work, death no longer moved him.</p> <p>Another performer displayed pure hatred, saying he discovered the meaning of the Holocaust after a drunken evening in New York, when he beat up someone who called him a \"hymie\".</p> <p>By giving a voice to a generation with no direct experience of the Nazi era, and by bringing together secular and religious Jews, Monday night's gathering could not have been more different from the official Holocaust Day.</p> <p>Yesterday, as every year, there was nothing on television but documentaries about the survivors of the ghettos and the camps and the radio stations played only sombre Hebrew songs.</p> <p>Cafes and cinemas were closed by law, and at 10am, when the siren sounded for two minutes of silence, everyone froze on the spot, except those Orthodox who believe that the dead should be remembered only with prayer. In Zion Square, Jerusalem, a man muzzled his dog for fear it would break the spell.</p> <p>But despite the power of such acts, and the Holocaust education in schools, people in the Tel Aviv audience - and the performers - said the official ceremonies failed to move them or to communicate the horrors of what happened.</p> <p>\"I found this more touching,\" said Shiraz Netzer, whose father was smuggled out of the Warsaw ghetto and hidden by a Polish family. \"Usually the children of those who went through the Holocaust are so cynical. But I thought this was nice, because it was not trying to make people cry, and because it was not kitsch.\"</p> <p>The producer, Sara Blau, said she started the alternative day of remembrance last year because she felt that the conventional ceremonies had \"fossilised\".</p> <p>\"Always, we are told that we are a collective group, and that we should all feel a certain way. But this ceremony is individual. Everyone here brings their own content.\"</p> <p>Although the event is still very much on the margins of Israeli society, she expects it will eventually help transform the way Israelis regard the Holocaust. \"In 10 years' time we will be the mainstream.\"</p>",

The line-up included a gossip columnist, a stand-up comic, and, perhaps most unusually for a secular occasion, an undertaker from an Orthodox Jewish burial society. The venue was equally unconventional: the crowded, smoky Barbie Club, a converted garage in an industrial district of south Tel Aviv. While Nazi newsreels played as a backdrop and the bells of railway crossings clanged, the performers and the packed audience of 250 - mainly in their 20s and early 30s - struggled to find meaning in an experience that is central to the Jewish state but remains beyond the comprehension of many of this generation. \"Maybe what we need is something like those weekend supplements: 100 things you never knew about Hitler,\" said Eliat Alkayam, in her cynical opening act. The comic, Rotem Itach-Ashbel, read from the diary of Anne Frank while chewing two shiny red apples - intended, she said, to show the Dutch teenager's undiminished desire while she was in hiding. The undertaker told of his three-day experiment in eating only crusts of bread to feel the hunger which the Jews had suffered. He explained that, in his line of work, death no longer moved him. Another performer displayed pure hatred, saying he discovered the meaning of the Holocaust after a drunken evening in New York, when he beat up someone who called him a \"hymie\". By giving a voice to a generation with no direct experience of the Nazi era, and by bringing together secular and religious Jews, Monday night's gathering could not have been more different from the official Holocaust Day. Yesterday, as every year, there was nothing on television but documentaries about the survivors of the ghettos and the camps and the radio stations played only sombre Hebrew songs. Cafes and cinemas were closed by law, and at 10am, when the siren sounded for two minutes of silence, everyone froze on the spot, except those Orthodox who believe that the dead should be remembered only with prayer. In Zion Square, Jerusalem, a man muzzled his dog for fear it would break the spell. But despite the power of such acts, and the Holocaust education in schools, people in the Tel Aviv audience - and the performers - said the official ceremonies failed to move them or to communicate the horrors of what happened. \"I found this more touching,\" said Shiraz Netzer, whose father was smuggled out of the Warsaw ghetto and hidden by a Polish family. \"Usually the children of those who went through the Holocaust are so cynical. But I thought this was nice, because it was not trying to make people cry, and because it was not kitsch.\" The producer, Sara Blau, said she started the alternative day of remembrance last year because she felt that the conventional ceremonies had \"fossilised\". \"Always, we are told that we are a collective group, and that we should all feel a certain way. But this ceremony is individual. Everyone here brings their own content.\" Although the event is still very much on the margins of Israeli society, she expects it will eventually help transform the way Israelis regard the Holocaust. \"In 10 years' time we will be the mainstream.\"",

Her novels, spare, immaculate masterpieces (few of them exceed 200 pages), divide into two sections; an earlier group loosely based on her own experiences, and a later group, in which she moves to other countries and periods. In 1979, she won the Booker Prize for her novel Offshore.</p> <p>\"Reading a Penelope Fitzgerald novel,\" observed Sebastian Faulks, \"is like being taken for a ride in a peculiar kind of car. Everything is of top quality - the engine, the coachwork and the interior all fill you with confidence. Then, after a mile or so, someone throws the steering-wheel out of the window.\"</p> <p>Fitzgerald was the second child of Edmund George Valpy \"Evoe\" Knox and his wife, Christina Hicks, and was educated at Wycombe Abbey and Somerville College, Oxford, to which she won a scholarship. Her father was the eldest son of the Bishop of Manchester, her mother the daughter of Edward Hicks, Bishop of Lincoln.</p> <p>Neither side of the family was well-off, and the atmosphere of hard living and high thinking was inherited by their daughter, who recalled her father's study as the only warm room in the house. It may also explain the profoundly moral, indeed religious, exploration of the human predicament and the relationship between body and soul apparent in her writing.</p> <p>Fitzgerald also inherited a habit of literature from her parents. Her father, who had wanted to write from his undergraduate days, was editor of Punch from 1932. Her mother, one of the first Somerville students, also wrote. \"Everyone in the house in Well Walk was writing,\" she remembered.</p> <p>Fitzgerald delayed her own literary career until the age of 60, when she published a life of Edward Burne-Jones (1975). She wrote two other biographies, a life of the poet Charlotte Mew (1984) and the Knox Brothers (1977), a composite study of her father and his three remarkable brothers, Dillwyn (classicist and cryptographer), Wilfred (Anglican priest) and Ronald (the famous Roman Catholic convert and apologist).</p> <p>All of them, she said, in explanation of her elliptical style, were given to understatement. This last book is not so much a biography as a portrait of an age and a milieu, both now disappeared; it is told with a dispassionate affection familiar to all readers of Fitzgerald's fiction. Characteristically, she contrived to suppress all mention of herself, any unavoidable reference being made obliquely and without name.</p> <p>Fitzgerald's first novel, The Golden Child (1977), which was written to divert her husband during his last illness, took the form of the classic detective story. It was inspired by the Tutankhamun exhibition at the British Museum, as Human Voices (1980) was based on her war years in the BBC, and At Freddie's (1982) on her experiences at the Italia Conti stage school, where she taught in the l960s. The Bookshop (1978) recalls her years of living in Southwold, where she herself worked in a bookshop, and Offshore was based on her family's life on a rat-ridden barge at Battersea - which sank twice.</p> <p>After that, she felt that she \"had finished writing about the things in my own life, which I wanted to write about: then you must look and find other experiences, you must launch out.\" In Innocence (1986), she launched out to 16th and 20th-century Italy, then to Moscow in 1913, in The Beginnings Of Spring (1988), to Cambridge in 1912, in The Gate Of Angels (1990), and to late 18th-century Germany in her story of the romantic poet and philosopher Novalis, in The Blue Flower (1995). This was probably her masterpiece; it won the American National Book Critics fiction prize in 1998, and helped introduce her to a wider American readership.</p> <p>Any division of this kind, however, tends to obscure the essential homogeneity of Fitzgerald's work. The qualities which make her writing unique are present in all of it, and her style is unmistakable. There is no sentence which could have been written by anyone else, just as no one has ever been able to repeat her peculiar blend of deadpan, slightly surreal, comedy, moral sensitivity and sober dubiety.</p> <p>What is striking is the accuracy of her observation, the aesthetically satisfying precision with which, stylistically, the arrow goes straight into the centre of the gold. The economy with which she achieved her effects - \"I always feel the reader is very insulted by being told too much,\" she said - and her ability to combine a microscopic with a panoramic perspective, made most other contemporary novels appear flatulent and over-written.</p> <p>Fitzgerald has been compared in her qualities of social comedy and irony to Jane Austen. The comparison is just in many ways, but ultimately unsatisfactory, for she had a metaphysical quality which is less apparent in Jane Austen - and Jane Austen was not the only novelist of that period by whom she was influenced. She spoke with enthusiasm of the way in which Sir Walter Scott mixed up fictional and real characters, and this is reflected in the appearance of the dying Gramsci, in Innocence, and of Fichte, Goethe and Schlegel in The Blue Flower.</p> <p>Throughout Fitzgerald's novels, there are certain recurring themes, the most striking of which is the single-minded and blinkered innocent (usually male), whose tunnel vision causes disaster to those around. There is an example in almost every book, the most satisfying perhaps being Fritz von Hardenberg, Novalis in The Blue Flower.</p> <p>There can be few better examples of her skill than the way in which the focus gradually transfers in the second half of the book from Fritz to his 14-year-old fianc\u00e9e Sophie, a brash, uninteresting teenager, who is dying of TB. This is a shift in perception, which is not just a fictional device but also a subtle moral judgment. Her work was very much in the tradition of European story-telling, Italo Calvino being a particularly close analogy.</p> <p>She married Desmond Fitzgerald, an Irish soldier who she met at a wartime party, in 1941; he died in 1976. They had a son and two daughters. In 1996, she was awarded the Heywood Hill Literary Prize for a lifetime's achievement in literature.</p> <p><b> Penelope Mary Fitzgerald, writer, born December 17 1916; died April 28 2000 </b></p>",

Her novels, spare, immaculate masterpieces (few of them exceed 200 pages), divide into two sections; an earlier group loosely based on her own experiences, and a later group, in which she moves to other countries and periods. In 1979, she won the Booker Prize for her novel Offshore. \"Reading a Penelope Fitzgerald novel,\" observed Sebastian Faulks, \"is like being taken for a ride in a peculiar kind of car. Everything is of top quality - the engine, the coachwork and the interior all fill you with confidence. Then, after a mile or so, someone throws the steering-wheel out of the window.\" Fitzgerald was the second child of Edmund George Valpy \"Evoe\" Knox and his wife, Christina Hicks, and was educated at Wycombe Abbey and Somerville College, Oxford, to which she won a scholarship. Her father was the eldest son of the Bishop of Manchester, her mother the daughter of Edward Hicks, Bishop of Lincoln. Neither side of the family was well-off, and the atmosphere of hard living and high thinking was inherited by their daughter, who recalled her father's study as the only warm room in the house. It may also explain the profoundly moral, indeed religious, exploration of the human predicament and the relationship between body and soul apparent in her writing. Fitzgerald also inherited a habit of literature from her parents. Her father, who had wanted to write from his undergraduate days, was editor of Punch from 1932. Her mother, one of the first Somerville students, also wrote. \"Everyone in the house in Well Walk was writing,\" she remembered. Fitzgerald delayed her own literary career until the age of 60, when she published a life of Edward Burne-Jones (1975). She wrote two other biographies, a life of the poet Charlotte Mew (1984) and the Knox Brothers (1977), a composite study of her father and his three remarkable brothers, Dillwyn (classicist and cryptographer), Wilfred (Anglican priest) and Ronald (the famous Roman Catholic convert and apologist). All of them, she said, in explanation of her elliptical style, were given to understatement. This last book is not so much a biography as a portrait of an age and a milieu, both now disappeared; it is told with a dispassionate affection familiar to all readers of Fitzgerald's fiction. Characteristically, she contrived to suppress all mention of herself, any unavoidable reference being made obliquely and without name. Fitzgerald's first novel, The Golden Child (1977), which was written to divert her husband during his last illness, took the form of the classic detective story. It was inspired by the Tutankhamun exhibition at the British Museum, as Human Voices (1980) was based on her war years in the BBC, and At Freddie's (1982) on her experiences at the Italia Conti stage school, where she taught in the l960s. The Bookshop (1978) recalls her years of living in Southwold, where she herself worked in a bookshop, and Offshore was based on her family's life on a rat-ridden barge at Battersea - which sank twice. After that, she felt that she \"had finished writing about the things in my own life, which I wanted to write about: then you must look and find other experiences, you must launch out.\" In Innocence (1986), she launched out to 16th and 20th-century Italy, then to Moscow in 1913, in The Beginnings Of Spring (1988), to Cambridge in 1912, in The Gate Of Angels (1990), and to late 18th-century Germany in her story of the romantic poet and philosopher Novalis, in The Blue Flower (1995). This was probably her masterpiece; it won the American National Book Critics fiction prize in 1998, and helped introduce her to a wider American readership. Any division of this kind, however, tends to obscure the essential homogeneity of Fitzgerald's work. The qualities which make her writing unique are present in all of it, and her style is unmistakable. There is no sentence which could have been written by anyone else, just as no one has ever been able to repeat her peculiar blend of deadpan, slightly surreal, comedy, moral sensitivity and sober dubiety. What is striking is the accuracy of her observation, the aesthetically satisfying precision with which, stylistically, the arrow goes straight into the centre of the gold. The economy with which she achieved her effects - \"I always feel the reader is very insulted by being told too much,\" she said - and her ability to combine a microscopic with a panoramic perspective, made most other contemporary novels appear flatulent and over-written. Fitzgerald has been compared in her qualities of social comedy and irony to Jane Austen. The comparison is just in many ways, but ultimately unsatisfactory, for she had a metaphysical quality which is less apparent in Jane Austen - and Jane Austen was not the only novelist of that period by whom she was influenced. She spoke with enthusiasm of the way in which Sir Walter Scott mixed up fictional and real characters, and this is reflected in the appearance of the dying Gramsci, in Innocence, and of Fichte, Goethe and Schlegel in The Blue Flower. Throughout Fitzgerald's novels, there are certain recurring themes, the most striking of which is the single-minded and blinkered innocent (usually male), whose tunnel vision causes disaster to those around. There is an example in almost every book, the most satisfying perhaps being Fritz von Hardenberg, Novalis in The Blue Flower. There can be few better examples of her skill than the way in which the focus gradually transfers in the second half of the book from Fritz to his 14-year-old fianc\u00e9e Sophie, a brash, uninteresting teenager, who is dying of TB. This is a shift in perception, which is not just a fictional device but also a subtle moral judgment. Her work was very much in the tradition of European story-telling, Italo Calvino being a particularly close analogy. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, an Irish soldier who she met at a wartime party, in 1941; he died in 1976. They had a son and two daughters. In 1996, she was awarded the Heywood Hill Literary Prize for a lifetime's achievement in literature. Penelope Mary Fitzgerald, writer, born December 17 1916; died April 28 2000",

      "bodyText": "The former head of East Germany's Olympics programme went on trial yesterday in what will be an unprecedented public examination of the project to produce super women athletes by feeding them steroids without their knowledge. Opening the trial of Manfred Ewald, once head of the Gymnastics and Sports Federation, the presiding judge dismissed moves for a one-day, open and shut trial of the sort which became routine for former communist officials accused of doping. \"This is not going to be a trial carried out behind the backs of those affected,\" Judge Dirk Dickhaus declared. He rejected defence claims that the 73-year-old defendant would be unable to follow the proceedings. Mr Ewald is the most senior former official to be brought before the courts on doping charges since the collapse of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). He is accused, together with a sports doctor, Manfred H\u00f6ppner, of aiding and abetting the bodily harming of 142 sportswomen, most of them swimmers and athletes. In earlier cases, former officials have testified that - beginning in the 1970s - the communist state systematically doped its sportsmen and women to boost its achievements. Some girls were started on injections or pills as young as 11, their coaches instructed to tell them they were taking vitamins, the prosecutor, Klaus-Heinrich Debes, told the court. He quoted Mr Ewald as saying: \"They're still so young and don't have to know everything.\" The prosecution accused Mr Ewald of dismissing warnings of health risks, ac cusing the experts who made them of \"cowardice\". Mr Ewald headed the GDR's top sporting body from 1961 to 1988. From 1974 Mr H\u00f6ppner was the chairman of its working group on supporting means - the euphemism used to describe doping. The indictment alleges that the two men were responsible for lasting side-effects from the intake of anabolic steroids. These included hormonal disturbances and damage to internal organs. Some women were still suffering from gynaecological disorders, it says. Thirty-two of the sportswomen referred to in the indictment have made themselves party to the case. They have been waiting for an opportunity to tell their stories, but have been repeatedly thwarted by plea bargaining deals that have resulted in brief hearings at which officials, trainers and doctors involved in doping were fined or given suspended sentences in return for a full confession. An identical outcome was expected in this case, especially since Mr Ewald's lawyers had produced evidence that he was not fit to stand trial. But the court's experts concluded otherwise, and Mr Dickhaus ordered that a full range of witnesses should be heard.",

An austere and aristocratic Marxist mandarin, he governed Vietnam for 32 years, from its independence from France through the long war with the United States, and was only finally nudged aside by more reform-minded leaders in the mid-1980s, when Vietnam began shedding the central economic controls he had put in place.</p> <p>Dong was among the most well-known of the group of shadowy leaders in Hanoi, particularly during the war with the US in the late 1960s, when he gave many interviews expressing North Vietnam's determination to defeat its massively more powerful adversary. But despite his elevated government position, and his membership of the Communist party politburo, he seemed to prefer the role of a Confucian administrator aloof from the factional storms blowing through Hanoi.</p> <p>His real influence came in the early days of the Vietnamese revolution, when he was among the first of a group of young intellectuals, mostly children of the mandarin elite, who joined Ho Chi Minh to fight French colonialism. Along with General Vo Nguyen Giap, he was there at the creation of the small group of guerrillas that grew into a military force capable of defeating France in 1954 and the US in 1975.</p> <p>Dong was little known before 1954, when he led a Vietnamese delegation to the Geneva conference that ended French rule in Indochina. Indeed, the French foreign minister, Georges Bidault, described him as a \"non-existent phantom\". The conference was not a success for Dong, and he buckled under pressure from the Soviet and Chinese governments to accept the division of Vietnam pending elections scheduled for 1956 - but never held. The splitting of the country along the 17th parallel kicked off another two decades of conflict.</p> <p>Elevated to the post of chairman of the council of ministers, or prime minister, in 1955, Dong survived the political turmoil of the early years of communist rule in Vietnam because of his proximity and self-deprecating loyalty to Ho Chi Minh, who referred to him as \"my other self\" and \"my favourite nephew\". While others made policy, Dong was there to ensure it was carried out.</p> <p>As Ho's health failed in the 1960s, Dong took an increasingly public role, travelling frequently to communist- bloc countries and giving interviews to the western press. His pronouncements that North Vietnam would endure US bombardments - and would ultimately prevail - made him an emblem of the hardiness and spirit of the North Vietnamese. This prominence led many at the time to believe that he was the real power in Vietnam, although, in fact, he played little role in the negotiations to end the war.</p> <p>Those sympathetic to Hanoi were charmed by his determined manner and his ability to pepper interviews with quotes from French writers. \"Intelligence and enthusiasm, lucidity and culture are rarely combined to the same degree in the same man,\" gushed the French photographer and journalist Marc Ribaud in Le Monde in 1969.</p> <p>Others portrayed his austere demeanour and mirthless, rumbling laugh in a more sinister light. Certainly, it was rare that he strayed from the evasive doublespeak of Marxist-Leninist leaders, but he had polish, fluency in French and a range of cultural references that most Vietnamese leaders lacked. A resentful Henry Kissinger, who met Dong in Hanoi in 1973 to initial the Paris peace agreement - and was infuriated by his demands - described him as \"wiry, short, wary and insolent\".</p> <p>Pham Van Dong was born in Quang Ngai province, in central Vietnam. He came from a mandarin family infused with a strong sense of nationalism. His father was a senior court official in Hue and secretary to the deposed Emperor Duy Tan, who was exiled to R\u00e9union by the French in 1919 for being too nationalist. Dong's father was also sidelined from the court, a disappointment that may have forged his son's anti-colonial sentiments.</p> <p>After the French lyc\u00e9e at Hue, Dong enrolled in the University of Hanoi, where he began a career of political activism. He ran into trouble with the French authorities in 1925 for organising a student strike during the funeral of the nationalist hero Phan Chu Trinh. He was expelled and left for China, where he studied at the Chinese Nationalist party's Whampoa Military Academy, and first met Ho Chi Minh.</p> <p>On Ho's orders, Dong returned to Vietnam in 1927 to organise the Thanh Nien youth movement. Arrested in 1929, he spent nearly seven years in Poulo Condore, an infamous French prison colony on an island in the South China Sea, which served as something of a university of the revolution. Released under an amnesty ordered by a new French government in 1936, he returned to political organisation, but fled Vietnam again three years later.</p> <p>In 1941, Dong joined Ho and other leaders in founding the Viet Minh, a united-front organisation aimed at ousting both the French and the Japanese, who by then had occupied Vietnam. In August 1945, taking advantage of the political vacuum at the end of the second world war, they seized power in Hanoi. Dong became finance minister, and was chief aide to Ho Chi Minh at the Fontainbleu talks of 1946 which failed to settle the issue of independence.</p> <p>As the French returned to Hanoi, the Viet Minh fled to the mountains. Dong was sent to his home province to lead the guerrilla movement there. It was at this time that he was said to have been involved in the violent purges of non-communists in the Viet Minh coalition. In 1951, he became vice-premier and, before the French surrender in 1954, he was made foreign minister.</p> <p>During the 1960s, Dong repeatedly told journalists that Hanoi had no intention of imposing communism on the south. Yet as soon as the battles ended in April 1975, the government started doing exactly that, interning hundreds of thousands of people in re-education camps and collectivising farms.</p> <p>At the same time, tensions started to rise with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and their supporters in Beijing. Dong led attempts to build closer ties with Vietnam's neighbours in southeast Asia and with Europe. He visited France for the first time since 1946, but failed to win pledges of support. By 1979, Vietnam was once again embroiled in war, this time with the Khmer Rouge and Hanoi's former allies in Beijing.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, Dong told a visitor that \"waging a war is simple, but running a country is very difficult\". Indeed, his administrative skills, with which he had channelled the energies of a nation in conflict, were far less successful in peacetime. Already nearly being destroyed by decades of war, Vietnam's economy was unable to endure a rapid shift towards Soviet-style central planning. An international economic embargo, declining agricultural production and a ruinous attempt at currency reform added to the problems.</p> <p>Later, Dong would only admit that \"mistakes were made\" after 1975, when the country suffered from what he called \"subjectivity and leftism\", jargon for the leadership's determined push for socialism that left Vietnam bankrupt and dependent on Moscow.</p> <p>For much of his time as prime minister, Dong wielded less power than his position would suggest. Increasingly, the reins of policymaking were taken over by the Communist party chief Le Duan and Le Duc Tho, the politburo member who negotiated with the US and, with Kissinger, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. \"When I say something, nobody listens,\" Dong was reported to have said. \"I cannot even choose my own ministers.\"</p> <p>His character was too remote and arid to capture public affection in the way that Ho Chi Minh had. On the other hand, this self-effacing approach enabled him to escape blame for many of the failures that afflicted Vietnam. Dong was said to speak out rarely in meetings, and was never quick to express an opinion.</p> <p>In 1986, he stepped down as premier and gave up his seat on the politburo. He held the post of special adviser to the Communist party central committee, and appeared regularly at ceremonial occasions. Dressed in a white Mao suit and dark glasses, his face lean and cadaverous, he was increasingly something of a Banquo's ghost, there to remind the new leadership, in their suits and ties, of their abandonment of all but a thin veneer of Marxism.</p> <p>Dong's communist credentials remained impeccable to the bitter end. \"Capitalism won't go far,\" he said in 1994. \"It carries within it the seeds of its own destruction.\" He wrote tirades about the dangers of Vietnam's rush towards the market, and was critical of the country's rising inequalities and corruption. But his message was lost on a people enjoying a measure of economic and political freedom that he had never allowed them.</p> <p>Although a prolific writer, Dong never produced a memoir. His life was sublimated to the cult of Ho Chi Minh, whom he never failed to quote in any interview or article. He wrote a hagiography of Ho in 1960, but most of his other works were collections of speeches and heavy articles published in the Communist party newspaper.</p> <p>Dong's private life remained resolutely private. Little is known about his marriage, except that his wife suffered from mental illnesses and was frequently hospitalised. He is thought to have had a son and a daughter. His family were never publicly acknowledged, so that, like Ho Chi Minh, he could portray himself as devoted only to the revolution.</p> <p>In later life, his health was often precarious. He had a pacemaker inserted in the late 1970s, and, from the mid-1980s, his sight failed, leaving him completely blind for the rest of his life. He lived in a modest house in the grounds of the presidential palace in Hanoi, not far from where Ho Chi Minh had also spent his final days. He remained a busy public figure to the end, writing critical articles and appearing at state functions.</p> <p><b> Pham Van Dong, politician, born March 1 1906; died April 29 2000 </b></p>",

An international economic embargo, declining agricultural production and a ruinous attempt at currency reform added to the problems. Later, Dong would only admit that \"mistakes were made\" after 1975, when the country suffered from what he called \"subjectivity and leftism\", jargon for the leadership's determined push for socialism that left Vietnam bankrupt and dependent on Moscow. For much of his time as prime minister, Dong wielded less power than his position would suggest. Increasingly, the reins of policymaking were taken over by the Communist party chief Le Duan and Le Duc Tho, the politburo member who negotiated with the US and, with Kissinger, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. \"When I say something, nobody listens,\" Dong was reported to have said. \"I cannot even choose my own ministers.\" His character was too remote and arid to capture public affection in the way that Ho Chi Minh had. On the other hand, this self-effacing approach enabled him to escape blame for many of the failures that afflicted Vietnam. Dong was said to speak out rarely in meetings, and was never quick to express an opinion. In 1986, he stepped down as premier and gave up his seat on the politburo. He held the post of special adviser to the Communist party central committee, and appeared regularly at ceremonial occasions. Dressed in a white Mao suit and dark glasses, his face lean and cadaverous, he was increasingly something of a Banquo's ghost, there to remind the new leadership, in their suits and ties, of their abandonment of all but a thin veneer of Marxism. Dong's communist credentials remained impeccable to the bitter end. \"Capitalism won't go far,\" he said in 1994. \"It carries within it the seeds of its own destruction.\" He wrote tirades about the dangers of Vietnam's rush towards the market, and was critical of the country's rising inequalities and corruption. But his message was lost on a people enjoying a measure of economic and political freedom that he had never allowed them. Although a prolific writer, Dong never produced a memoir. His life was sublimated to the cult of Ho Chi Minh, whom he never failed to quote in any interview or article. He wrote a hagiography of Ho in 1960, but most of his other works were collections of speeches and heavy articles published in the Communist party newspaper. Dong's private life remained resolutely private. Little is known about his marriage, except that his wife suffered from mental illnesses and was frequently hospitalised. He is thought to have had a son and a daughter. His family were never publicly acknowledged, so that, like Ho Chi Minh, he could portray himself as devoted only to the revolution. In later life, his health was often precarious. He had a pacemaker inserted in the late 1970s, and, from the mid-1980s, his sight failed, leaving him completely blind for the rest of his life. He lived in a modest house in the grounds of the presidential palace in Hanoi, not far from where Ho Chi Minh had also spent his final days. He remained a busy public figure to the end, writing critical articles and appearing at state functions. Pham Van Dong, politician, born March 1 1906; died April 29 2000",

But she continued to write to her boyfriend's mother, Sue Appleby, saying how pleased she was to be a part of her family. On October 12, 1999,she telephoned Mrs Appleby at her home in to say that she had had a baby boy and was about to catch a train to visit her.

      "bodyText": "P&amp;O's \u00a3200m cruise ship Aurora was yesterday forced to limp back to port after breaking down off the French coast just one day into her maiden voyage. Early reports suggested a problem with a propeller shaft overheating just 350 miles from Southampton. The Aurora's 1,800 passengers, who were were described by P&amp;O as \"bitterly disappointed\", were due to arrive home in Southampton this morning with their cruise cancelled. Passengers were quickly offered a full compensation package, which includes a refund on their ticket as well as another free cruise of an equivalent value. The 76,000-tonne cruise ship which stands 10 metres higher than the Niagara Falls and 270 metres long, the length of three Statues of Liberty, left Southampton on Monday after being formally named by the Princess Royal. Ominously, when the superliner was christened, the traditional magnum of champagne dropped into the water without smashing, traditionally seen as a sign of bad luck in nautical circles. A P&amp;O spokeswoman said Aurora had been off the French coast, heading towards the Bay of Biscay, when the decision was taken to abandon the cruise. Passengers were given the news in an announcement from the captain, Steve Burgoine. The vessel was due to dock at Lisbon this afternoon. After that, the Aurora had been due to visit Barcelona, Monte Carlo, Livorno, Naples, Ajaccio and Gibraltar, before returning to Southampton on May 15. P&amp;O said the propeller shaft bearing had over heated, making it impossible for the vessel to continue with her two-week maiden voyage. Aurora immediately started heading back at half-steam to Southampton. The huge ship offers 939 cabins accommodating 1,874 passengers and two luxury penthouse suites serviced by a butler. Four decks of cabins, among the 10 passenger decks, have private balconies and the Aurora has 9,200 square metres of open deck space, enough to accommodate 35 tennis courts.",

      "bodyText": "John Hartson has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association. The FA has charged the Wimbledon striker over an alleged scuffle in the tunnel before Sunday's Premiership match with Bradford at Valley Parade. Hartson was sent off at Valley Parade by referee Jeff Winter for foul and abusive language. However, on the basis of reports from referee Winter and fourth official John Leek, he has now also been charged by the FA in connection with an alleged incident in the tunnel before the game. The sending-off means that the Welsh international will already miss the final game of the season away to Southampton, as well as the first two matches of the next campaign. But given his previous record of three past misconduct charges - two fines and a three-match ban for kicking Eyal Berkovic on the West Ham training ground - it is likely that he would be given a further ban if found guilty of misconduct.",

So why not, in this week of local elections and Labour anniversaries, take the game a stage further - and play fantasy governments?</p> <p>Let's start with a faraway Labour party that has ditched its flirtation with Thatcherite economics and come home, relocating itself on the unashamed left. Let's imagine this Labour party is speeding through a programme so progressive it would make radicals everywhere drool. It has raised the taxes of the rich and transferred the cash to pensioners, students and the needy. It has stopped privatisation dead in its tracks, even renationalising one public service because Labour believes there are some things the free market cannot get right. It has given trade unions their rights back and boosted spending on schools and hospitals. It has rewritten employment law, moving the country away from what the prime minister calls the \"loony edges of a deregulated labour market\". It has started building houses again.</p> <p>Wait, it gets better. This fantasy government has abolished all honours that come with titles, ensuring an egalitarian nation with no more use for Dames and Sirs. The Labour leader has even taken a tilt at the monarchy itself, describing a republic as \"inevitable\". She enforces a stoutly non-nuclear defence policy - and has dared confront the right by scrapping an order for 28 swank new American fighter planes, arguing that the country does not need them and cannot afford them. She wants her army to be the world leader in peacekeeping and to shift from militarism to humanitarianism. She has also moved to decriminalise cannabis and encouraged a freedom of information regime so liberal that cabinet papers are available to anyone who wants them within three months. Best of all, this leftwing government is not besieged on all sides by a hostile press or conservative public opinion. Instead, it is surging ahead in the polls leaving the opposition to gasp with envy and awe.</p> <p>Enough of such fantasy! Surely no such party can exist, able to govern from the left even as it carries a grateful nation with it. Can it? The happy answer is that it can and it does. For this is not a Guardian readers' hallucination; this faraway land is not some impossible Utopia. Rather the country is New Zealand and the party is Labour, under its new prime minister, Helen Clark.</p> <p>What she is up to makes not only a fascinating tale from the south Pacific. It also provides a warning lesson for Tony Blair and New Labour in what can happen to parties of the left that march too far rightward in the pursuit of power. Those forecasting the shape of New Labour in 2010 don't need to gaze into the crystal ball: they can look down under.</p> <p>For Helen Clark's party were Blairites a decade before Blair. Their 1997 came in 1984 when, just like New Labour, they were elected in a massive landslide. They promptly dumped every economic principle that had once been Labour holy writ. The party converted to the free market with a zeal that out-Thatchered Thatcher and out-Reaganed Reagan. If it moved, Labour and its finance minister Roger Douglas privatised it. Taxes were slashed, workers' protection binned. New Zealand became the citadel of the new right.</p> <p>At first it worked. NZ Labour achieved Tony Blair's hallowed goal - winning a second term. The party had seduced rich, middle New Zealand, winning voters old Labour couldn't reach. \"But the heartlands started to go off us,\" Clark told me from her office overlooking Wellington harbour. Labour's core supporters were \"pretty appalled at what was happening\".</p> <p>Here is the warning for Blair. New Zealand's heartlands rebelled in what Clark calls - using the plain English that has helped make her so popular - \"disgust\" at the rightward thrust of their party. Barely into its second term, Labour revolted. Divisions led to a massive election defeat in 1990, with the left breaking off to form a new party and Roger Douglas's right eventually doing the same. Labour was reduced to a rump. With less than 5,000 members, the new leader - Helen Clark - began the 90s with what is said to be the lowest approval rating in world polling history: 2%.</p> <p>The remedy was to return to Labour's core values. \"We'd had experience of going right, we knew there was no market for that,\" she explains. \"But we also knew there was an appetite for an alternative.\" It took nine years and two more election defeats to get it right. Clark is in no doubt why it took so long: \"We weren't left enough.\"</p> <p>Could this be the fate of British Labour? Might the full-blooded conversion to the free market - typified by this week's Commons vote on the partial privatisation of the air traffic control system - eventually fall out of favour? Might Labour's left rebel, as they did down under? Could Blair win his precious two terms, only to see his party serve three more in opposition - rejected for its failure to provide an alternative to the Conservatives?</p> <p>There are differences between the two situations, of course. For one thing, the \"Rogernomics\" of the Douglas era was much more rightwing than the fiscal prudence of Gordon Brown: after all, the NZ Labour government of the 1980s had to drag a country that was run, in Clark's words, like a \"Polish shipyard\" into the 20th century.</p> <p>New Zealand's electoral system, a form of proportional representation, is a key difference. Size matters, too: it's possible that state-run public services make more sense when the population is less than four million. And leftwing politics sits well with a country like New Zealand. As the prime minister says, \"In a settler society, you start off with people a lot more even.\"</p> <p>NZ is young and egalitarian by instinct: that's why there was barely a whisper of protest at the promise to make no more Dame Kiri Te Kanawas or Sir Edmund Hilarys. If Australia gets its act together and removes the Queen as head of state, then Clark cannot imagine New Zealand lagging far behind. Britain, she appreciates, is different - \"essentially a much more hierarchical society\" than hers.</p> <p>Still, we may have something to learn from this country 12,000 miles away, where a prime minister explicitly promised her nation a radical programme and where she is delivering it at a breakneck pace. For Helen Clark is proving that leaders of social democratic, \"first world\" parties do not always have to talk like conservatives to win and keep power. They can respect the basic rules of sound economic management - and then take on the corporations, stand up for workers' rights, tax the top 5% of earners, curb defence spending, strip the constitution of privilege and deference and open up the government. They can do all that and still ride high in the polls.</p> <p>Helen Clark met Tony Blair in Downing Street last month. Apparently he asked lots of questions about her flying start in government: let's hope he was taking notes.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Jonathan.Freeland@theguardian.com\">Jonathan.Freeland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
