      "body": "<p>Seeing in a new year is usually a cause for uncorking bottles and celebrating. The big exception is the start of the new fiscal year - not even accountants will be throwing parties when the 2001/02 tax year dawns on Friday. </p> <p>But the day will be marked by the Inland Revenue sending out tax returns to 8,654,869 individuals. Here are some tips on how to handle your tax affairs, whether or not you hear from the Revenue. </p> <p>\u0095 Check your tax coding. About 20 per cent of them are wrong, estimates accountant Richard Murphy. If yours is one of them, incorrect amounts of Pay As You Earn tax will be deducted from your pay. By looking at the coding you receive, you should be able to see if the figures are at least roughly right - whether, for example, you are still receiving the company car or other 'benefit in kind' which should show up on the coding. </p> <p>\u0095 Get to work on your tax return now. 'Start collecting the information you need, if you can stand it,' says Jane Moore of charity TaxAid. Keep those bits of paper that you will need - for instance, the P60 from your employer detailing your pay and tax paid for 2000/01, which you should receive by the end of May at the latest. </p> <p>Keep all your bank statements safely, especially if you are self-employed, since the Revenue has the right to see them if it investigates your affairs. If you get your return done early, you may be able to negotiate a discount with an accountant, says Murphy. But you will not be able to do that if you leave it until to the 31 January 2002 deadline for filing your return. </p> <p>\u0095 Claim the new children's tax credit if you have not done so yet. Worth a maximum of \u00a310 a week (\u00a3520 a year), this is available to working families with a child under 16. The amount is tapered down if one parent is a higher-rate taxpayer, and it disappears completely if the main breadwinner earns more than \u00a342,000 a year. You need to fill in a form to claim it. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't forget about the working families' tax credit (WFTC) if you have children and one parent is working. This credit should ensure that a family where one parent works full time has a minimum income of \u00a3225 a week by October. It is mainly aimed at low- income households, but some households with income of \u00a330,000 can benefit, depending on their circumstances. Fairly complicated calculations are needed to see whether you are eligible, but organisations such as the Maternity Alliance (020 7588 8582) will help, as will the Government's WFTC helpline (0800 597 5976). </p> <p>\u0095 Think of making your individual savings account (Isa) or other tax-efficient investments at the start, rather than the end, of the tax year. Understandably, many people are worried about putting money into equity Isas because of uncertainty over the value of shares, but if you have decided to get a cash Isa you will get an extra year of tax relief by investing now rather than next March. </p> <p>\u0095 Remember that there are two years left for the self-employed to claim 100 per cent tax relief in the year of purchase on computers, software and internet-enabled mobile phones.

If you are an employee, there are some system changes which could affect you. The NI threshold is being raised to align it with the personal allowance for income tax - \u00a34,535 for 2001/02.

      "bodyText": "Seeing in a new year is usually a cause for uncorking bottles and celebrating. The big exception is the start of the new fiscal year - not even accountants will be throwing parties when the 2001/02 tax year dawns on Friday. But the day will be marked by the Inland Revenue sending out tax returns to 8,654,869 individuals. Here are some tips on how to handle your tax affairs, whether or not you hear from the Revenue. \u0095 Check your tax coding. About 20 per cent of them are wrong, estimates accountant Richard Murphy. If yours is one of them, incorrect amounts of Pay As You Earn tax will be deducted from your pay. By looking at the coding you receive, you should be able to see if the figures are at least roughly right - whether, for example, you are still receiving the company car or other 'benefit in kind' which should show up on the coding. \u0095 Get to work on your tax return now. 'Start collecting the information you need, if you can stand it,' says Jane Moore of charity TaxAid. Keep those bits of paper that you will need - for instance, the P60 from your employer detailing your pay and tax paid for 2000/01, which you should receive by the end of May at the latest. Keep all your bank statements safely, especially if you are self-employed, since the Revenue has the right to see them if it investigates your affairs. If you get your return done early, you may be able to negotiate a discount with an accountant, says Murphy. But you will not be able to do that if you leave it until to the 31 January 2002 deadline for filing your return. \u0095 Claim the new children's tax credit if you have not done so yet. Worth a maximum of \u00a310 a week (\u00a3520 a year), this is available to working families with a child under 16. The amount is tapered down if one parent is a higher-rate taxpayer, and it disappears completely if the main breadwinner earns more than \u00a342,000 a year. You need to fill in a form to claim it. \u0095 Don't forget about the working families' tax credit (WFTC) if you have children and one parent is working. This credit should ensure that a family where one parent works full time has a minimum income of \u00a3225 a week by October. It is mainly aimed at low- income households, but some households with income of \u00a330,000 can benefit, depending on their circumstances. Fairly complicated calculations are needed to see whether you are eligible, but organisations such as the Maternity Alliance (020 7588 8582) will help, as will the Government's WFTC helpline (0800 597 5976). \u0095 Think of making your individual savings account (Isa) or other tax-efficient investments at the start, rather than the end, of the tax year. Understandably, many people are worried about putting money into equity Isas because of uncertainty over the value of shares, but if you have decided to get a cash Isa you will get an extra year of tax relief by investing now rather than next March. \u0095 Remember that there are two years left for the self-employed to claim 100 per cent tax relief in the year of purchase on computers, software and internet-enabled mobile phones. This concession started on 6 April 2000 for a three-year period, but many people may not be aware of it. \u0095 Do not get caught out by National Insurance.

      "body": "<p>Annuities have been dogged by criticism, but the Prudential believes its new product could be a winner for more well-off pensioners. </p> <p>An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum payment. If you have a personal pension or are part of your employer's money purchase scheme you must buy an annuity when you want to draw your pension or put off doing this by buying an income drawdown scheme, which is riskier. </p> <p>Under present govern ment rules you must turn your pension pot into an income from an annuity before you reach 75, which many people find unfair. They argue that they should be able to do what they like with their pension money. </p> <p>The Prime Minister's wife, Cherie Booth QC, will take the Government to court on behalf of Preston pensioner Joe Singer to challenge this under the European Convention on Human Rights, which outlaws prejudice on the grounds of age. </p> <p>There were high hopes before the Budget that the Chancellor would relax the annuity rules, but Brown rejected this. </p> <p>Other concerns about annuities include lack of investment flexibility, lack of transparency and lack of death benefits - when you die the funds in the annuity pass to the insurance company. The fall in yields on government stock, on which annuity rates are based, has also meant that present annuity payouts are much lower than in the past. </p> <p>Experts say the new Prudential product, the Flexible Lifetime Annuity, goes some way towards addressing these concerns. At one level it works like a traditional annuity, paying an income for life in retirement. But instead of committing all of your funds to buying the annuity when you retire, you can leave money invested to continue growing. You can choose the level of income you receive annually from between upper and lower limits, which the Pru resets every three years after reviewing the progress of your investments. </p> <p>Your money can be invested in the stock market via 14 different funds from a selection of investment managers, including Schroders, Perpetual and Merrill Lynch. There are three investment strategies to choose from - cautious, standard and adventurous. Policyholders can make six free fund switches a year. The idea is that investment returns feed into the fund while you draw income. </p> <p>When members of the fund die, the money they have not ring-fenced for their family (they can ring-fence up to 80 per cent to pay an income to their family for 10 years after their death) is redistributed among the other people in the pool for what it calls a lifetime bonus. Prudential says the bonus enables it to guarantee income. Income levels are guaranteed never to fall below half the original starting amount. </p> <p>You can switch all of the money to an ordinary fixed annuity at any time, but do not have to do so until you are 90. </p> <p>This is a complex product and must be purchased through an independent financial adviser. </p> <p>The Pru annuity may be more flexible and transparent than a traditional prod uct but has not addressed the death benefit issue. And the minimum investment is \u00a3100,000, while the average annuity purchase is \u00a330,000. It is also unsuitable for those who need an impaired life annuity because of poor health. </p> <p>Once you have chosen an annuity you cannot change it, so it is vital to scour the market and consider your options carefully. All annuities have some common features: the older you are the more money you receive, and women typically get less because their life expectancy is longer. But there are many different types of annuity. These range from straightforward level annuities to investment-linked and escalating annuities. </p> <p>Level annuities pay the same income year after year. You have certainty but they are vulnerable to inflation. </p> <p>Most people buy this kind of annuity, according to Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau, because it delivers the maximum income on a small pot - at first. 'The drop from salary upon retirement is huge, so people often take this option. But what they don't realise is that it is like having a fixed salary for 20 years-plus.' </p> <p>To make sure your fund increases in line with inflation, you could choose an escalating annuity, where your income increases at a fixed rate. But initially these tend to pay out a lower income than level annuities. </p> <p>Investment-style annuities - such as with-profits and unit-linked varieties - have the potential to offer a higher income, but your pension pot will be exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market. </p> <p>\u0095 The Annuity Bureau produces a fact sheet on the Prudential annuity.

      "bodyText": "Annuities have been dogged by criticism, but the Prudential believes its new product could be a winner for more well-off pensioners. An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum payment. If you have a personal pension or are part of your employer's money purchase scheme you must buy an annuity when you want to draw your pension or put off doing this by buying an income drawdown scheme, which is riskier. Under present govern ment rules you must turn your pension pot into an income from an annuity before you reach 75, which many people find unfair. They argue that they should be able to do what they like with their pension money. The Prime Minister's wife, Cherie Booth QC, will take the Government to court on behalf of Preston pensioner Joe Singer to challenge this under the European Convention on Human Rights, which outlaws prejudice on the grounds of age. There were high hopes before the Budget that the Chancellor would relax the annuity rules, but Brown rejected this. Other concerns about annuities include lack of investment flexibility, lack of transparency and lack of death benefits - when you die the funds in the annuity pass to the insurance company. The fall in yields on government stock, on which annuity rates are based, has also meant that present annuity payouts are much lower than in the past. Experts say the new Prudential product, the Flexible Lifetime Annuity, goes some way towards addressing these concerns. At one level it works like a traditional annuity, paying an income for life in retirement. But instead of committing all of your funds to buying the annuity when you retire, you can leave money invested to continue growing. You can choose the level of income you receive annually from between upper and lower limits, which the Pru resets every three years after reviewing the progress of your investments. Your money can be invested in the stock market via 14 different funds from a selection of investment managers, including Schroders, Perpetual and Merrill Lynch. There are three investment strategies to choose from - cautious, standard and adventurous. Policyholders can make six free fund switches a year. The idea is that investment returns feed into the fund while you draw income. When members of the fund die, the money they have not ring-fenced for their family (they can ring-fence up to 80 per cent to pay an income to their family for 10 years after their death) is redistributed among the other people in the pool for what it calls a lifetime bonus. Prudential says the bonus enables it to guarantee income. Income levels are guaranteed never to fall below half the original starting amount. You can switch all of the money to an ordinary fixed annuity at any time, but do not have to do so until you are 90. This is a complex product and must be purchased through an independent financial adviser. The Pru annuity may be more flexible and transparent than a traditional prod uct but has not addressed the death benefit issue. And the minimum investment is \u00a3100,000, while the average annuity purchase is \u00a330,000. It is also unsuitable for those who need an impaired life annuity because of poor health. Once you have chosen an annuity you cannot change it, so it is vital to scour the market and consider your options carefully. All annuities have some common features: the older you are the more money you receive, and women typically get less because their life expectancy is longer. But there are many different types of annuity. These range from straightforward level annuities to investment-linked and escalating annuities. Level annuities pay the same income year after year. You have certainty but they are vulnerable to inflation. Most people buy this kind of annuity, according to Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau, because it delivers the maximum income on a small pot - at first. 'The drop from salary upon retirement is huge, so people often take this option. But what they don't realise is that it is like having a fixed salary for 20 years-plus.' To make sure your fund increases in line with inflation, you could choose an escalating annuity, where your income increases at a fixed rate. But initially these tend to pay out a lower income than level annuities. Investment-style annuities - such as with-profits and unit-linked varieties - have the potential to offer a higher income, but your pension pot will be exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market. \u0095 The Annuity Bureau produces a fact sheet on the Prudential annuity.

If the internet banks can't get it right, what chance does anyone else have? </p> <p>Car manufacturers haven't helped either. They have been predictably slow at adapting to the net, many regarding it purely as a marketing tool and chary of upsetting their dealer networks. Most manufacturers' sites are full of clever graphics juxtaposed with classy photographs that take for ever to download, but the only practical advice they offer is help to find your nearest dealer. </p> <p>You can't buy online at BMW, Rover, Toyota or Nissan, for example. And Nissan was obviously slow off the mark when it came to registering a domain name - try <a href=\"http://www.nissan.com\">www.nissan.com</a> and you reach the homepage of a humble American computer-sales company. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there are several valid reasons for considering the internet when buying a car - and more people are doing so. A survey by Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young last year revealed that while just 0.1 per cent of the UK population were willing to buy a car online, the figure would rise to 8 per cent over the following three years. </p> <p>Ultimately, what most consumers want to know is whether they can save money by buying online. For UK drivers, this is a pressing need, given that car makers seem bent on charging us more than anyone else in Europe. Anecdotal evidence of this has been confirmed by the European Commission. In a survey published earlier this year, it said that a Mazda 323, for example, sells for \u00a35,307 in Denmark a staggering \u00a311,106 here. </p> <p>The good news for UK consumers is that it is cheaper to buy online. In some cases, you can save up to 30 per cent on the list price of a new car. The key, however, is to tread carefully. </p> <p>The first thing to point out is that there are several types of site. Some will let you compare prices without actually allowing you to buy, others will help you import new cars from the continent, and there are also several purely online retailers, as well as the car dealers' sites. </p> <p>Fish4.co.uk, carprice-check.com, autobytel and autotrader all allow you to search for but not buy cars on sale in your area. Type in a make and model of car and where you live, and the sites will try to come up with a list to suit. They will also put you in touch with a dealer which has the car you want so that you can arrange a test drive. Price comparison sites are usually independent, but they will try to push other services, such as insurance and finance packages. </p> <p>Inchcape-owned autobytel.co.uk launched last April and refers customers to accredited dealers. It claims to have sold more than 6,000 cars. Fish4 is a broader comparison site that also finds jobs and houses. </p> <p>But the major problem with all the price comparison sites is that they are just large directories relying on dealers for up-to-date information. It is conceivable that you will find the right car at the right price, only to be told by the dealer that it was sold last week. </p> <p>The best deals on price typically come from sites that specialise in importing cars from the continent. They source and import the car of your choice, taking advantage of the price differentials between UK and Europe. </p> <p>OneSwoop.com, which claims to be the leader in matching buyers with imported models on the internet, has been making a great deal of noise about 'rip-off Britain'. Marketing director Tom Buehlmann says: 'The much-publicised price cuts by manufacturers have failed to filter through to the forecourt. When we launched the site we averaged savings of 35-40 per cent off UK list prices. Now it is more like 20 per cent, but it is still a significant price gap.' </p> <p>Buehlmann predicts that this year more British buyers than ever before will look to the continent for their new Y-registered car. </p> <p>Our trawl of OneSwoop found, for example, a Ford Mondeo 1.8i 16v LX for \u00a312,166, compared with a UK list price of \u00a314,595 - a saving of almost 17 per cent. The UK list price of a Volkswagen Golf 1.9 GT Tdi is \u00a312,329 - 14 per cent higher than the cost of importing through OneSwoop. </p> <p>The drawback with sites that import cars is that you may face a considerable wait for the vehicle - sometimes as long as six months. OneSwoop says it can sometimes deliver within four weeks but admits that manufacturers are being increasingly difficult about supplying right-hand drive cars from the continent. </p> <p>The other potential fear for a would-be importer is that imports carry a one-year warranty compared with a typical three years on UK-sourced cars. Buehlmann puts this down to simple scaremongering by UK-based dealers since most sites will offer extended warranties - all OneSwoop cars come with a three-year warranty. A bigger worry with imports is the price you will be able to get in the second-hand market. Many dealers will try to buy them for less. </p> <p>Importers, though, are not the only online players that can offer big discounts. Retail sites such as Virgin Cars and Direct Line's jamjar.com also claim to offer savings of up to 30 per cent - by cutting out dealers. Virgin Cars imports and sources from select UK dealers. At launch it promised savings of between 10 and 30 per cent. Jamjar sells imports but is also in partnership with Dixon Motors and promises discounts of 20-30 per cent. </p> <p>One plus is that jamjar claims 100 per cent availability of all makes and models, guarantees online part exchange and makes the delivery to your door within days. However, discounts vary between makes of car, and in some cases Jamjar can offer no saving at all. </p> <p>It is also fair to say that several car dealers offer cars at competitive prices online. Paul Dixon, chief executive of Dixon Motors, the third biggest dealer in the UK, operates a chain of dealerships in the north of England and has been actively adapting its business to the internet. </p> <p>'We sold 1,000 cars in the first two months of the year via the internet,' he says. But even Dixon simply puts you in touch with the listed dealer - you can't actually transact online. </p> <p>A quick search on Dixon's site for a Ford Focus brought up a list of eight cars, all over six months old. The newest was a 1.6 hatchback with one mile on the clock and priced at \u00a310,695. But Dixon believes that because his site lists both second-hand and new cars, he appeals to a wider market. </p> <p>Certainly the second-hand and nearly-new market is huge and while most online retailers list second-hand cars, there are few that specialise in them. Both the AA and the RAC have spotted a gap in the market that they are rushing to fill. The AA is finalising discussions with several car providers, including UK car dealers. </p> <p>The RAC, meanwhile, has just signed a strategic partnership with Yourauto choice.com, which claims to be the leading online retailer of nearly new cars. </p> <p>A joint venture between car rental company Avis and US firm Navidec, it claims to have the widest range of cars in the UK, typically 20-40 per cent cheaper than new - and it offers free home delivery. </p> <p>If you're serious about buying online, visit as many sites as possible for the best price. Read terms and conditions carefully. Every online retailer should offer to call you or put you in touch with a telesales operator. If they can't, they're not worth dealing with, even if it looks as if you'll be saving thousands.

      "body": "<p>Just when you thought things couldn't get worse in the technology market, Framlington sells nearly all the assets in its NetNet investment trust to pay off bank debts. Investors who put \u00a360m into the trust were left last week with a portfolio worth just \u00a38m. </p> <p>The investors were predominantly institutional - Aberdeen Asset Management and Legg Mason to name but two - but the fate of their money serves as a timely warning for private investors, who are turning to split capital investment trust shares to boost their income. </p> <p>The trust, a split capital fund (not to be confused with the NetNet unit trust) launched last March at the peak of the technology boom and borrowed a further \u00a340m from Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>This borrowing, known in the investment trust industry as gearing, was designed to enable the trust to buy more assets - and produce a high-income yield. After 10 years the trust's manager, Chris Bell, would sell the portfolio and use the cash to pay off the \u00a340m bank loan and pay income shareholders 40p a share. Any capital left over was to be paid to capital shareholders. </p> <p>Bank of Scotland lent the money on the grounds that the loan could be called in if the ratio of assets to loan fell to 1.7. At outset the ratio was 2.5 (\u00a3100m in assets divided by \u00a340m in debt), but as soon as Bell started investing the trust's money, the technology market began to slide.

      "bodyText": "Just when you thought things couldn't get worse in the technology market, Framlington sells nearly all the assets in its NetNet investment trust to pay off bank debts. Investors who put \u00a360m into the trust were left last week with a portfolio worth just \u00a38m. The investors were predominantly institutional - Aberdeen Asset Management and Legg Mason to name but two - but the fate of their money serves as a timely warning for private investors, who are turning to split capital investment trust shares to boost their income. The trust, a split capital fund (not to be confused with the NetNet unit trust) launched last March at the peak of the technology boom and borrowed a further \u00a340m from Bank of Scotland. This borrowing, known in the investment trust industry as gearing, was designed to enable the trust to buy more assets - and produce a high-income yield. After 10 years the trust's manager, Chris Bell, would sell the portfolio and use the cash to pay off the \u00a340m bank loan and pay income shareholders 40p a share. Any capital left over was to be paid to capital shareholders. Bank of Scotland lent the money on the grounds that the loan could be called in if the ratio of assets to loan fell to 1.7. At outset the ratio was 2.5 (\u00a3100m in assets divided by \u00a340m in debt), but as soon as Bell started investing the trust's money, the technology market began to slide. Last week the ratio came much closer to the 1.7 cut-off point. Craig Walton, Framlington's marketing director, says: 'The board considered that if there was another leg down [in share prices], it would break its covenant. The board thought it better to repay the debt and leave it as an ungeared trust.'

Even if a trust does not breach its agreed ratio of assets to bank loan, gearing can be dangerous for shareholders. Gearing is beneficial in a rising market as it enables investors to buy more assets and enjoy more gains than their capital would otherwise allow. But in a falling market any losses are magnified. All invest ment trusts are allowed to gear, but the effect can be extreme in the highly geared ordinary and income shares of split capital investment trusts.

      "body": "<p>Add the population of Paris to the population of London and what do you get? Slightly fewer people than the total number of back pain victims in the UK right now. Over the past few years, it may have been eclipsed by stress, depression and long hours in discussions about occupational health, but for 16 million sufferers, back pain has never gone away. It is still the biggest physical reason for sick days - the Trades Union Congress estimates it costs the economy \u00a33.8billion a year - and there is evidence it may be getting worse. </p> <p>'Our increasingly sedentary lifestyles may be partly to blame,' says ergonomic consultant Dr Kevin Tesh. 'Driving, sitting statically in front of the computer, slouching in front of the TV - all increase our risk of back pain.' </p> <p>Younger workers may assume that it takes many years of this sort of abuse before back problems develop. Not so. The nature of their work may be putting young people at greater risk. </p> <p>Last month the TUC published a survey showing that more than half of people aged 16-24 work in 'awkward or tiring positions' (against 45 per cent of the total workforce); 78 per cent have jobs involving repetitive movements (compared with 65 per cent); and 71 per cent have to work quickly (60 per cent). In fact, on all the major risk factors in the survey, young workers scored highest. Back strain is also more common in small firms than larger ones, says the TUC, with seven out of 10 companies employing fewer than 20 people reporting problems. New working methods are creating new back problems. 'The proliferation of lap-tops is a big worry,' says Tesh. 'The problems can be worse than at a conventional set-up because either the screen or the keyboard is always in the wrong place.' Home offices are also a concern. Back pain may well develop over time but it can also flare up worryingly quickly. In Joanne Kerr's case, serious problems developed in just two months. 'I was at a City law firm working on publications,' she says. 'I needed a deep desk because my job required a big computer screen. So two desks were pushed together to make an L shape and I worked at the junction of the two. Because of the desk legs, I either had to sit with one of my legs at right angles or twist my legs around the desk legs. It was very uncomfortable. </p> <p>'One day at home, when I bent over to pick up a towel, my back locked and I couldn't stand up. I had complained about the desk from day one but it wasn't until I came in doubled over with a prolapsed disc that they did anything about it. And even then they only removed the offending desk legs.' </p> <p>Kerr needed two weeks off work on such strong pain killers and muscle relaxants that she could barely function. 'Luckily, in my health authority there was a fast-track system for lumbar problems and I saw a physiotherapist within the week.' Treatment was twice-weekly physiotherapy, traction and an exercise programme of 20 minutes, twice a day. Kerr is now back at work but still does 10 minutes of stretching daily. Prompt treatment is vital, says Tesh. 'The longer you go without, the more the muscles deteriorate. You need to keep active.' Many people with more serious back problems may, with a GP's referral, be entitled under the DfEE's Access To Work scheme to help with specialist equipment to get them back to work, including desks and chairs. 'Many doctors and patients don't realise this because backache has traditionally not been taken seriously,' says Julia Brown-Dow, disability consultant with Back Care. </p> <p>'Because of the regulations, many employers now provide decent chairs,' says Tesh, 'but that's no good if they don't show staff how they work. Then there are working conditions. Mental strain leads to muscle strain. People under pressure and lacking job satisfaction are far more likely to have back and upper limb disorders.' Indeed, taken together, stress and musculo-skeletal disorders, including back pain and repetitive strain injuries, now account for 85 per cent of ill health and injury at work, says trade union MSF. </p> <p>'The firm charged clients hundreds of pounds an hour so I'd like to think they just didn't know about adjustable workstations rather than that they were too mean to buy me one,' says Kerr. 'I certainly didn't know. I assumed my problem was just bad luck. Later I realised it was the cumulative effect of my working position.' </p> <p>Tesh says: 'Ergonomists need to be involved when offices are designed. That's when we can have maximum impact at minimum cost.' This rarely happens but firms that don't make their workplaces safe have no excuse. The rules have been in place since 1992. </p> <p>Mike Dixon, MSF's health, safety and environment officer, says: 'Employers must carry out a risk assessment at each workstation for each user. The workstation should allow each task to be carried out safely and comfortably at a suitable height.' </p> <p>Theoretically, the Health and Safety Executive or environmental health departments can place improvement notices on dangerous workstations but this is seldom done. 'The regulations are there but there's a reluctance to enforce them,' says Dixon. </p> <p>So it's down to you. </p> <p>Call Back Care on 020 8977 5474 </p> <p><strong>Spinal trap: How to avoid injury and discomfort</strong></p> <p><strong> The chair</strong><br> \u0095 The law says chairs used at workstations must be stable, comfortable, allow freedom of movement and be adjustable in both height and tilt </p> <p>\u0095 This usually means a five-legged star shape base with a back that moves independently of the seat and supports the back so that it maintains its natural S shape (you can find where your back curves by running your knuckles up your spine) - if your chair doesn't provide support here, you may need a lumbar cushion. </p> <p><strong> Sitting at the desk</strong><br> \u0095 Adjust the height of your chair so that when you use your keyboard, arms and shoulders are relaxed, elbows at right angles and forearms parallel to the floor. Thighs should also be parallel to the floor or inclined forward with a 3-5cm gap between the edge of your seat and your knees </p> <p>\u0095 If you are tall you need a height-adjustable desk. Failing that put the desk on blocks. </p> <p>\u0095 If your legs dangle over the chair, use a footrest </p> <p>\u0095 Armrests should not get in the way of any of the above. If they do, move or remove them. </p> <p> <strong>Display screen</strong><br> \u0095 Site as large a screen as possible an arm's length away with the top of the screen at eye-level. Clean it frequently and make sure the type size, colour contrast and office lighting allow you to read it without squinting or leaning forward </p> <p><strong> Desk layout</strong><br> \u0095There should be space between the keyboard and the edge of your desk to rest your wrists. Use a wrist-rest if it helps </p> <p>\u0095 Keep the things you use frequently - especially the mouse - close by so you're not constantly stretching and reaching. </p> <p><strong> Using equipment</strong><br> \u0095 Use the mouse and keyboard with gentle movements using the whole arm, keeping wrists horizontal. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't shoulder-cradle the phone. Use a headset when talking and typing at the same time. </p> <p><strong> Working-habits </strong><br> \u0095 Stop every 20 minutes. Employers must provide breaks - many short ones are better than a couple of long ones. </p> <p><strong> Lap-tops </strong><br> \u0095 All the above applies to lap-tops, which is why they are best kept for occasional use. If you do use one in the office, use a separate screen. </p> <p><strong> Three easy exercises </strong><br> \u0095 Pull chin and turn head slowly side to side. </p> <p>\u0095 Raise shoulders to ears and back. </p> <p>\u0095 Stand up feet slightly apart and knees bent. With hands in small of back, push hips forward and shoulders back. Repeat each five times every so often throughout the day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Add the population of Paris to the population of London and what do you get? Slightly fewer people than the total number of back pain victims in the UK right now. Over the past few years, it may have been eclipsed by stress, depression and long hours in discussions about occupational health, but for 16 million sufferers, back pain has never gone away. It is still the biggest physical reason for sick days - the Trades Union Congress estimates it costs the economy \u00a33.8billion a year - and there is evidence it may be getting worse. 'Our increasingly sedentary lifestyles may be partly to blame,' says ergonomic consultant Dr Kevin Tesh. 'Driving, sitting statically in front of the computer, slouching in front of the TV - all increase our risk of back pain.' Younger workers may assume that it takes many years of this sort of abuse before back problems develop. Not so. The nature of their work may be putting young people at greater risk. Last month the TUC published a survey showing that more than half of people aged 16-24 work in 'awkward or tiring positions' (against 45 per cent of the total workforce); 78 per cent have jobs involving repetitive movements (compared with 65 per cent); and 71 per cent have to work quickly (60 per cent). In fact, on all the major risk factors in the survey, young workers scored highest. Back strain is also more common in small firms than larger ones, says the TUC, with seven out of 10 companies employing fewer than 20 people reporting problems. New working methods are creating new back problems. 'The proliferation of lap-tops is a big worry,' says Tesh. 'The problems can be worse than at a conventional set-up because either the screen or the keyboard is always in the wrong place.' Home offices are also a concern. Back pain may well develop over time but it can also flare up worryingly quickly. In Joanne Kerr's case, serious problems developed in just two months. 'I was at a City law firm working on publications,' she says. 'I needed a deep desk because my job required a big computer screen. So two desks were pushed together to make an L shape and I worked at the junction of the two. Because of the desk legs, I either had to sit with one of my legs at right angles or twist my legs around the desk legs. It was very uncomfortable. 'One day at home, when I bent over to pick up a towel, my back locked and I couldn't stand up. I had complained about the desk from day one but it wasn't until I came in doubled over with a prolapsed disc that they did anything about it. And even then they only removed the offending desk legs.' Kerr needed two weeks off work on such strong pain killers and muscle relaxants that she could barely function. 'Luckily, in my health authority there was a fast-track system for lumbar problems and I saw a physiotherapist within the week.' Treatment was twice-weekly physiotherapy, traction and an exercise programme of 20 minutes, twice a day. Kerr is now back at work but still does 10 minutes of stretching daily. Prompt treatment is vital, says Tesh. 'The longer you go without, the more the muscles deteriorate. You need to keep active.' Many people with more serious back problems may, with a GP's referral, be entitled under the DfEE's Access To Work scheme to help with specialist equipment to get them back to work, including desks and chairs. 'Many doctors and patients don't realise this because backache has traditionally not been taken seriously,' says Julia Brown-Dow, disability consultant with Back Care. 'Because of the regulations, many employers now provide decent chairs,' says Tesh, 'but that's no good if they don't show staff how they work. Then there are working conditions. Mental strain leads to muscle strain. People under pressure and lacking job satisfaction are far more likely to have back and upper limb disorders.' Indeed, taken together, stress and musculo-skeletal disorders, including back pain and repetitive strain injuries, now account for 85 per cent of ill health and injury at work, says trade union MSF. 'The firm charged clients hundreds of pounds an hour so I'd like to think they just didn't know about adjustable workstations rather than that they were too mean to buy me one,' says Kerr. 'I certainly didn't know. I assumed my problem was just bad luck. Later I realised it was the cumulative effect of my working position.' Tesh says: 'Ergonomists need to be involved when offices are designed. That's when we can have maximum impact at minimum cost.' This rarely happens but firms that don't make their workplaces safe have no excuse. The rules have been in place since 1992. Mike Dixon, MSF's health, safety and environment officer, says: 'Employers must carry out a risk assessment at each workstation for each user. The workstation should allow each task to be carried out safely and comfortably at a suitable height.' Theoretically, the Health and Safety Executive or environmental health departments can place improvement notices on dangerous workstations but this is seldom done. 'The regulations are there but there's a reluctance to enforce them,' says Dixon. So it's down to you. Call Back Care on 020 8977 5474 Spinal trap: How to avoid injury and discomfort The chair \u0095 The law says chairs used at workstations must be stable, comfortable, allow freedom of movement and be adjustable in both height and tilt \u0095 This usually means a five-legged star shape base with a back that moves independently of the seat and supports the back so that it maintains its natural S shape (you can find where your back curves by running your knuckles up your spine) - if your chair doesn't provide support here, you may need a lumbar cushion. Sitting at the desk \u0095 Adjust the height of your chair so that when you use your keyboard, arms and shoulders are relaxed, elbows at right angles and forearms parallel to the floor. Thighs should also be parallel to the floor or inclined forward with a 3-5cm gap between the edge of your seat and your knees \u0095 If you are tall you need a height-adjustable desk. Failing that put the desk on blocks. \u0095 If your legs dangle over the chair, use a footrest \u0095 Armrests should not get in the way of any of the above. If they do, move or remove them. Display screen \u0095 Site as large a screen as possible an arm's length away with the top of the screen at eye-level. Clean it frequently and make sure the type size, colour contrast and office lighting allow you to read it without squinting or leaning forward Desk layout \u0095There should be space between the keyboard and the edge of your desk to rest your wrists. Use a wrist-rest if it helps \u0095 Keep the things you use frequently - especially the mouse - close by so you're not constantly stretching and reaching. Using equipment \u0095 Use the mouse and keyboard with gentle movements using the whole arm, keeping wrists horizontal. \u0095 Don't shoulder-cradle the phone. Use a headset when talking and typing at the same time. Working-habits \u0095 Stop every 20 minutes. Employers must provide breaks - many short ones are better than a couple of long ones. Lap-tops \u0095 All the above applies to lap-tops, which is why they are best kept for occasional use. If you do use one in the office, use a separate screen. Three easy exercises \u0095 Pull chin and turn head slowly side to side. \u0095 Raise shoulders to ears and back. \u0095 Stand up feet slightly apart and knees bent. With hands in small of back, push hips forward and shoulders back. Repeat each five times every so often throughout the day.",

It is reduced on earnings of more than \u00a330,000 and phased out completely at \u00a340,000. In a household with one higher-rate taxpayer and a non earning partner, there will be no credit if the earner has a salary of more than \u00a340,000. But in a home with two \u00a330,000 earners the full credit will be given. Despite the disadvantages of being a higher-rate tax payer there are some benefits and several ways in which you can reduce your tax bills: \u0095 You receive 40 per cent tax relief on contributions to pensions. Anyone in this tax group looking for investment opportunities should look first at their retirement funds. Warburton says: 'The first thing you do is your pension.' \u0095 If you give to charity through the Government's Gift Aid scheme, you can reclaim the difference between basic-rate tax, at 22 per cent, and the higher rate of 18 per cent. \u0095 Repaying mortgage debt becomes particularly worthwhile. Depending on your mortgage rate you can achieve the equivalent of double-figure returns. \u0095 You may be able to cut your tax bills by putting investments in the name of a spouse or partner who pays a lower rate, or no tax at all. \u0095 Tax free investments, primarily individual savings accounts (Isas) become particularly worthwhile. \u0095 National Savings certificates may be attractive, despite their low nominal rates. A higher-rate taxpayer would have to earn 6.08 per cent on a taxable product to better the nominal 3.65 per cent fixed rate on National Savings two-year certificates. \u0095 There are some investment opportunities such as venture capital trusts that may appeal to higher-rate tax payers with a taste for some risk.",

      "body": "<p>Back in January, after Manchester United destroyed West Ham 3-1 in the Premiership, several of the more seasoned members of the press box declared the performance the finest they had seen by a British club side. Sure-footed, quick, resolute, Sir Alex Ferguson's team played football of a brilliance that reduced their gifted opponents to the role of slack-jawed bystanders. Never, Andy Gray suggested on television, can such ascendancy have been witnessed in domestic football. </p> <p>Such euphoria raised eyebrows on Merseyside more rapidly than at a Roger Moore lookalike convention. Despite the decade of success for the Manchester Reds, in the stands at Anfield they believe Fergie's mob still have some way to go before they match the dominance of Liverpool at their best. As the banner once unfurled in the Kop at a Liverpool-Manchester United match attested: \"Form is temporary, class is permanent.\" </p> <p>Much as Ferguson enjoys a football argument, there is no doubt he wants to end this one before he retires. United's manager would like to be remembered as the man who built the finest ever British club team. Another landmark to posterity is almost in his grasp, as United look certain to join Arsenal, Huddersfield and Liverpool in recording a hat-trick of consecutive championship wins. </p> <p>At their strongest United can claim to possess the finest club midfield in the world, built around the genius of Roy Keane. Their speed of counter-attack, allied to four top-drawer strikers, is enough to petrify any defence. Nevertheless the real test of their historical mettle remains unanswered: do they measure up to the greatest ever Liverpool team? </p> <p>It is a curious anomaly that the most successful Anfield side in terms of trophy accumulation was managed not by Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley or even Kenny Dalglish, but by Joe Fagan. Having graduated from the legendary Liverpool boot room in 1983, his first of only two seasons in charge, Fagan presided over a treble of his own: the championship, the European Cup and the League Cup. And he did it with a side who, though lacking the beauty of Dalglish's 1988 team or the drive of Paisley's 1977 outfit, have a claim to being the most efficient of them all. </p> <p>Even so, if Fagan's Liverpool side were transported to the present day to take on Ferguson's United, there is no question who would win. Propelled by medically monitored diets, unencumbered by midweek alcohol binges, and with injuries treated by scientifically observed rest and recuperation rather than industrial quantities of cortisone, Keane and his boys would wallop the time travellers. Fitter, quicker and stronger, they are also infinitely better prepared. </p> <p><strong> Training ethos</strong><br> </p> <p>Looking back on the way Fagan's Liverpool team approached the game, you wonder how they won anything. In 1984 their right-back Phil Neal played much of the season with a broken toe, an injury he didn't dare report for fear of losing his place. These days, the moment Ryan Giggs touches the back of his thigh, a fully qualified physiotherapy staff of nine is scrambled to massage his tender hamstrings back into shape. </p> <p>Plus there is a much more sophisticated training ethos at United's Carrington complex. Back then Liverpool largely prepared on a diet of five-a-sides. The coaching staff would not presume to tell the players how to approach free-kicks, say, or corners. Actually they would not tell them very much at all. Kenny Dalglish was the first Liverpool manager to pay any heed to the opposition, the first to alter tactics and team selection to address opponents' strengths or weaknesses. Until then players were left to their own devices. </p> <p>Jan Molby, who arrived in the summer of 1984 from Ajax, was amazed at the lack of instruction he received at Anfield. Used to the Ajax method of intensive one-to-one sessions with coaches, as he strapped on his boots before making his debut he realised no one at his new club had told him anything about how they wanted to him to play. So he cornered Fagan and asked what he should do. </p> <p>\"Don't worry, lad,\" said Fagan. \"We've watched you play, we know you're good. Just go out there and try and fit in.\" </p> <p>Amateurish though their preparation may seem, Liverpool then were a product of their times, and should be judged by the way they dominated them. After all, they won a few games. And in many ways, even though in 1983-84 Fagan became the first manager in history to win the championship in his first season (an achievement his successor, Dalglish, was soon to match), the players did it largely by managing themselves. </p> <p>\"Much of the leadership and organisation essentially came from within the dressing room,\" says Professor John Williams, the football academic and author of Passing Rhythms, an examination of Liverpool's era of dominance. \"Dalglish sorted out the front end of the team, Alan Hansen the back. And Fagan would never have presumed to instruct the players how to behave off the field either. That responsibility was left to the senior players. And you only have to look at Ian Rush's autobiography to see that serious drinking sessions were frequent.\" </p> <p>Such behaviour would not be tolerated at Ferguson's United (or, indeed, Gerard Houllier's Liverpool). But there is no question that the one-for-all, all-for-one mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. And team is the operative word. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this as a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, though, the team played as an entity greater than the sum of its parts. </p> <p>\"There is no argument that, if you are comparing squads, the current United one wins hands down,\" Williams says. \"But if you are looking for a team, that Liverpool would be hard to touch.\" </p> <p>It is all there in the statistics. In 1983-84, in the days when rotation was something feudal farmers did, Liverpool used 15 players in 42 league games. So far this season, in 30 matches, United have used 23. In 1984 Bruce Grobbelaar, Kennedy and Mark Lawrenson played every league game; Rush and Neal (broken toe and all) played in every game bar one. The closest United have to an ever-present is Gary Neville, who has missed only one of their league games this season; Giggs, meanwhile, has started only 19 times in the Premiership. </p> <p>That Liverpool familiarity led to an almost telepathic ability with a pass. And a collective ruthlessness which was not always pretty to watch. </p> <p><strong> Pass masters</strong><br> </p> <p> \"People forget how terribly dull they could be away from home,\" Williams says. \"They weren't interested in scoring, just winning. I'm not sure you could get away with that these days. There is much more public scrutiny, there's live television coverage from the most obscure European destination. You can't have that hidden away stuff. United now go away and try to win well in a way Liverpool then didn't need to.\" </p> <p>However they did it (they were masters of the back-pass to the keeper), perhaps the best measure of Fagan's Liverpool side was that, in the European Cup in 1984, they won away in the quarter-final against Benfica, away in the semi-finals in Bucharest and, to all intents, away in the final against Roma, as it was played in the Italians' stadium. </p> <p>\"The fact that game was won in Rome on penalties is perhaps an even greater achievement,\" says Kevin Sampson, the novelist and Liverpool follower. \"The penalties took place at the Roma end but they weren't intimidated and just did their job.\" </p> <p>That was the night Grobbelaar, with his comedy wobbly-knees act, personified Liverpool's attitude: \"Watching that side you had the definite feeling of impregnability,\" Sampson says. \"You'd look at that spine of Lawrenson, Hansen, Souness, Rush and Dalglish, and just couldn't see how they would be beaten. </p> <p>\"Dalglish is the greatest Liverpool player ever. Who comes into the next category is more contentious, but Dalglish is unequivocally the best. He relished scoring beautiful goals, and putting through those passes to Rush. You look at the present United team: Giggs, Keane, Beckham - all world class. And you could make a case for Paul Scholes. But could you really see Andy Cole getting past Hansen?\" </p> <p>Maybe not, but Beckham would have roasted Kennedy. Indeed, with Dalglish against Jaap Stam, Giggs against Neal and - reach for the crash helmets - Keane against Souness, a game between the two greats would be mouth-watering. But whoever won the subjective battle, United fans would have this comfort: Anfield regulars might be able to argue the merits of past Liverpool sides, but United's excellence is in the present. </p> <p>For Sven-Goran Eriksson's latest game in charge of the national side, seven United players were on the field at the final whistle; Liverpool could boast only one. Even in the halcyon days of 1984, Neal and Lee were the only Merseyside Reds to wear three lions on his chest - although Liverpool fans will point out that the rest of the side did all play international football, the majority for Scotland. </p> <p>How long United's superiority will last is the question. This lunchtime's match may be the least anticipated clash for years, but the balance of power between the two clubs stands at an intriguing junction. </p> <p>Back in 1986, Alex Ferguson arrived at Old Trafford to find a squad of underachieving, over-drinking dilettantes. He immediately focused their minds on the great winning machine down the road: outperform Liverpool, he told them, and you will outperform everyone. His first success was in cups, where he injected the victory habit into the dressing room, ready for a league challenge. But he was helped immeasurably when, four years in, Liverpool messed up their management succession and imploded. </p> <p>Sound familiar? Well, in 1998 Houllier arrived at Liverpool to find a squad of underachieving, over-drinking socialites. He immediately focused their minds on the great team down the road - beat Manchester United and you'll beat everyone - and is now beginning to instil a winning habit via cup competitions. Whether the next stage opens up for him, however, is largely down to the United board. </p> <p>\"For every Liverpool fan the day of Ferguson's retirement cannot come soon enough,\" says Sampson. \"He is the man, and we all pray he takes the recipe with him.\" </p> <p>In football, history is in the past. It is the future that counts. </p> <p><strong>Liverpool 1983/84 v Man United 2000/01</strong></p> <p><strong> Fabien Barthez</strong><br> </p> <p>When he keeps his arms down, the best in the Premiership. <strong> 8</strong> </p> <p><strong> Gary Neville</strong><br> </p> <p>Driven, committed and uncompromising, the soul of United. With an excellent attacking touch. <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> Mickael Silvestre</strong><br> </p> <p>Once seen as the weakest link, now developing into some player. Not yet Paolo Maldini. One day, maybe. <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p><strong> Jaap Stam</strong><br> </p> <p>Bald bulwark who terrifies the opposition. And that's just during the warm-up. This season, though, spoiled by injury. <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> Wes Brown</strong><br> </p> <p>England's greatest defensive prospect since Bobby Moore. But still learning. <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> David Beckham</strong><br> </p> <p>Off colour of late, but no one can gainsay his excellence. <strong> 8</strong> </p> <p><strong> Roy Keane</strong><br> </p> <p>Astonishing appetite, strength and football brain. World class. <strong> 10</strong> </p> <p><strong> Paul Scholes</strong><br> </p> <p>The nearest thing to a present-day Dalglish: quick feet, quick mind, with power coming from a backside the size of Salford. <strong> 9</strong> </p> <p><strong> Ryan Giggs</strong><br> </p> <p>His speed makes him untouchable. When he's fit. <strong> 8</strong> </p> <p><strong> Andy Cole</strong><br> </p> <p>Emphatic in United colours, whatever he does in the white of England. <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> Teddy Sheringham</strong><br> </p> <p>Enjoying a 20-goal Indian summer. According to Glenn Hoddle, the first two yards are in his brain. Which explains the big head. <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> Total: 84</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Bruce Grobbelaar</strong><br> </p> <p>What was seen as eccentricity now compromised by allegations of match fixing. Good shot stopper, though.<strong> 6</strong> </p> <p><strong> Phil Neal</strong><br> </p> <p>Strong, reliable, great with a penalty. And a broken toe.<strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> Alan Kennedy</strong><br> </p> <p>On paper a limited player, but he thrived in the company of greatness. <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p><strong> Mark Lawrenson</strong><br> </p> <p>Quick, slick, skilful. Blessed with apparently telescopic legs. <strong> 8</strong> </p> <p><strong> Alan Hansen</strong><br> </p> <p>As above, only more so. Plus, as relaxed on the pitch as he is in the television studio. <strong> 9</strong> </p> <p><strong> Sammy Lee</strong><br> </p> <p>Small, chirpy and non-stop. Now on the Anfield coaching staff, seemingly not having aged at all. <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> Graeme Souness</strong><br> </p> <p>Fearsome, ruthless, yet extravagantly skilful. The stiletto in a silk glove. <strong> 9</strong> </p> <p><strong> John Wark</strong><br> </p> <p>Midfield workhorse, signed halfway through the season and slotted in as if he had been born on the Mersey. <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p><strong> Craig Johnston</strong><br> </p> <p>The original Aussie with attitude. Underestimated at opponents' peril. <strong> 7</strong> </p> <p><strong> Kenny Dalglish</strong><br> </p> <p>The man who made the difference. <strong> 10 </strong></p> <p><strong> Ian Rush</strong><br> </p> <p>Scored 32 league goals that year, mainly gorging on Dalglish passes. <strong>9 </strong></p> <p><strong> Total: 84</strong><br></p>",

Pass masters \"People forget how terribly dull they could be away from home,\" Williams says. \"They weren't interested in scoring, just winning. I'm not sure you could get away with that these days. There is much more public scrutiny, there's live television coverage from the most obscure European destination. You can't have that hidden away stuff. United now go away and try to win well in a way Liverpool then didn't need to.\" However they did it (they were masters of the back-pass to the keeper), perhaps the best measure of Fagan's Liverpool side was that, in the European Cup in 1984, they won away in the quarter-final against Benfica, away in the semi-finals in Bucharest and, to all intents, away in the final against Roma, as it was played in the Italians' stadium. \"The fact that game was won in Rome on penalties is perhaps an even greater achievement,\" says Kevin Sampson, the novelist and Liverpool follower. \"The penalties took place at the Roma end but they weren't intimidated and just did their job.\" That was the night Grobbelaar, with his comedy wobbly-knees act, personified Liverpool's attitude: \"Watching that side you had the definite feeling of impregnability,\" Sampson says. \"You'd look at that spine of Lawrenson, Hansen, Souness, Rush and Dalglish, and just couldn't see how they would be beaten. \"Dalglish is the greatest Liverpool player ever. Who comes into the next category is more contentious, but Dalglish is unequivocally the best. He relished scoring beautiful goals, and putting through those passes to Rush. You look at the present United team: Giggs, Keane, Beckham - all world class. And you could make a case for Paul Scholes. But could you really see Andy Cole getting past Hansen?\" Maybe not, but Beckham would have roasted Kennedy. Indeed, with Dalglish against Jaap Stam, Giggs against Neal and - reach for the crash helmets - Keane against Souness, a game between the two greats would be mouth-watering. But whoever won the subjective battle, United fans would have this comfort: Anfield regulars might be able to argue the merits of past Liverpool sides, but United's excellence is in the present. For Sven-Goran Eriksson's latest game in charge of the national side, seven United players were on the field at the final whistle; Liverpool could boast only one. Even in the halcyon days of 1984, Neal and Lee were the only Merseyside Reds to wear three lions on his chest - although Liverpool fans will point out that the rest of the side did all play international football, the majority for Scotland. How long United's superiority will last is the question. This lunchtime's match may be the least anticipated clash for years, but the balance of power between the two clubs stands at an intriguing junction. Back in 1986, Alex Ferguson arrived at Old Trafford to find a squad of underachieving, over-drinking dilettantes. He immediately focused their minds on the great winning machine down the road: outperform Liverpool, he told them, and you will outperform everyone. His first success was in cups, where he injected the victory habit into the dressing room, ready for a league challenge. But he was helped immeasurably when, four years in, Liverpool messed up their management succession and imploded. Sound familiar? Well, in 1998 Houllier arrived at Liverpool to find a squad of underachieving, over-drinking socialites. He immediately focused their minds on the great team down the road - beat Manchester United and you'll beat everyone - and is now beginning to instil a winning habit via cup competitions. Whether the next stage opens up for him, however, is largely down to the United board. \"For every Liverpool fan the day of Ferguson's retirement cannot come soon enough,\" says Sampson. \"He is the man, and we all pray he takes the recipe with him.\" In football, history is in the past. It is the future that counts. Liverpool 1983/84 v Man United 2000/01 Fabien Barthez When he keeps his arms down, the best in the Premiership. 8 Gary Neville Driven, committed and uncompromising, the soul of United. With an excellent attacking touch. 7 Mickael Silvestre Once seen as the weakest link, now developing into some player. Not yet Paolo Maldini. One day, maybe. 6 Jaap Stam Bald bulwark who terrifies the opposition. And that's just during the warm-up. This season, though, spoiled by injury. 7 Wes Brown England's greatest defensive prospect since Bobby Moore. But still learning. 7 David Beckham Off colour of late, but no one can gainsay his excellence. 8 Roy Keane Astonishing appetite, strength and football brain. World class. 10 Paul Scholes The nearest thing to a present-day Dalglish: quick feet, quick mind, with power coming from a backside the size of Salford. 9 Ryan Giggs His speed makes him untouchable. When he's fit. 8 Andy Cole Emphatic in United colours, whatever he does in the white of England. 7 Teddy Sheringham Enjoying a 20-goal Indian summer. According to Glenn Hoddle, the first two yards are in his brain. Which explains the big head. 7 Total: 84 Bruce Grobbelaar What was seen as eccentricity now compromised by allegations of match fixing. Good shot stopper, though. 6 Phil Neal Strong, reliable, great with a penalty. And a broken toe. 7 Alan Kennedy On paper a limited player, but he thrived in the company of greatness. 6 Mark Lawrenson Quick, slick, skilful. Blessed with apparently telescopic legs. 8 Alan Hansen As above, only more so. Plus, as relaxed on the pitch as he is in the television studio. 9 Sammy Lee Small, chirpy and non-stop. Now on the Anfield coaching staff, seemingly not having aged at all. 7 Graeme Souness Fearsome, ruthless, yet extravagantly skilful. The stiletto in a silk glove. 9 John Wark Midfield workhorse, signed halfway through the season and slotted in as if he had been born on the Mersey. 6 Craig Johnston The original Aussie with attitude. Underestimated at opponents' peril. 7 Kenny Dalglish The man who made the difference. 10 Ian Rush Scored 32 league goals that year, mainly gorging on Dalglish passes. 9 Total: 84",

It also boasts two of the Peak's ancient Seven Wonders, first extolled in the 17th century - Peak Cavern, the largest cave entrance in Britain, and Mam Tor, the \"Shivering Mountain\" on the outskirts of the village, which is at present still barred from access. </p> <p>But there is much more to Castleton than its \"Wonders,\" as this short village walk will show. Starting from the main car park, turn left into Cross Street and then right opposite the Bull's Head pub into Castle Street. A few yards up here on the left is the gateway to St Edmund's Parish Church, one of the oldest and most interesting in the Peak. The zig-zag decorated Norman chancel arch echoes exactly that of the entrance to Peveril Castle, on the crag above, perhaps indicating the same architect. </p> <p>From the church, walk up to the Market Place, where a path in the corner (signposted) leads up a steep path to Peveril Castle, built by William Peveril shortly after the Conquest to oversee his hunting and lead mining interests in the Royal Forest of the Peak.

It is one of a series of 12 which have been produced by the Lake District National Park Authority in a \"Right Here, Right Now!\" pack, which includes local attractions, events and activities still open in the National Park. </p> <p>From the main car park in the centre of Coniston, take Lake Road down to the Pier and Landing Stage where the Coniston Launch Company offers a 20-minute cruise across the lake to John Ruskin's former home at Brantwood, on the eastern shore. Later in the season, the National Trust's ornate Victorian steam-driven launch, the Gondola, will provide a similar service. You can buy an inclusive ticket for \u00a36.70. </p> <p>Alighting at the pier at Brantwood, allow plenty of time to explore Ruskin's home from 1872 to his death in 1900. Take the lake-side lane which leads north from Brantwood towards Hawkshead, and which provides similar spectacular views over the lake towards the brooding shape of the Old Man. After about a mile, turn left just past How Head and descend by a minor lane to the head of the lake, passing a car park on your right. There are good views down the five-mile length of the lake before you join the B5385 and turn left, leaving the lake at Kirby Quay, back into Coniston village by Bannock Stone Bridge over Yewdale Beck. </p> <p> Recommended restaurant: The Jumping Jenny (named after Ruskin's boat) at Brantwood.

Our route starts from the car park in Holyrood Park Road, where you walk up towards the impressive volcanic sill formations of Salisbury Crags. Take the track leading off to the right and known as the Radical Road, suggested for public enjoyment by Sir Walter Scott, which leads up under the crags, the haunt of a colony of stiff-winged fulmars. </p> <p>Eventually, the road descends towards the ancient Palace of Holyrood House, with, beyond it, the ultra-modern buildings of the new Scottish Assembly. </p> <p>From St Anthony's Well, take the faint path that leads up below Haggis Knowe (also known as Fairies' Knowe or the Cockleshell), where a rocky path leads up to the 15th-century ruins of St Anthony's Chapel. Bear right and the path leads into a grassy valley called the Dry Dam, with Pulpit Rock away to your left. </p> <p>Follow the path that leads up the centre of the gorse-covered valley, finally bearing right to join the steep, direct ascent to the summit of Arthur's Seat. After admiring the view, descend over the grassy former cultivation terraces east of Crow Hill to reach The Queen's Drive car park at the foot of Dunsapie Crag. From here take the 209 steps known as Jacob's Ladder down to the park gates at Duddingston and a well-earned pint at The Sheep Heid Inn - which claims to be the oldest pub in Edinburgh. From here it is a short step along Duddingston Road back to Holyrood Park Road. </p> <p> Recommended pub: The Sheep Heid Inn (est 1320), Duddingston Village, Edinburgh. Further information from: Holyrood Park Information Centre ( 0131-556 1761). </p> <p><strong> Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire </strong><br> </p> <p> The impressive sweeping \"scars\" of Robin Hood's Bay, on the coastal fringe of the North York Moors south of Whitby, is one of the geological showplaces of Britain. </p> <p>Our short walk starts from the central roundabout opposite the Victoria Hotel. Take the cliff-top path to the excellent viewpoint of Bank Top. Descend past the sea mine down the steep hill, passing the Laurel Inn, and then left just before reaching the bridge over the King's Beck along the higgledy-piggledy shops of cobbled Chapel Street. The street bends left into King Street, where you turn right, down into The Dock, opposite the Bay Hotel. </p> <p>Walk back up King Street and turn right after the Dolphin Hotel, down steps which lead to the sea wall. Turn left to the end of the wall and climb more steps to the top of The Bank, where you turn right back to the car park. </p> <p> Recommended restaurant: The Old Chapel, Chapel Street, Robin Hood's Bay. Further information from: Whitby Tourist Information Centre, Langbourne Road, Whitby (01947 602674). </p> <p><strong> Sutton Park, Sutton Coldfield</strong><br> </p> <p> Sutton Park, just 10 miles from the centre of Birmingham, is an amazing survival story. It consists of more than 2,500 acres of largely unspoilt, ancient oak woodland, lowland heath, wetland and medieval mill and fish pools - a real taste of open country showing how the Midlands was before industrialisation. </p> <p>Grazed by cattle only during the summer months, it has so far escaped the foot-and-mouth ban and is open to walkers, but not horse-riders, at present. </p> <p>My favourite Sutton Park walk starts from the car park near Bracebridge Pool, which is reached off Hartop Road, which winds around the walled, north-eastern edge of the park. Bracebridge Pool is one of the oldest and most natural-looking lakes in the park. The Boat House and Bracebridge Cottage on the dam of the pool provides refreshment, but our path leads off to the right through the trees on the northern edge of the lake. </p> <p>This is the famous Bridges Walk, known and loved by generations of children who delight in trying to count the numerous plank bridges which cross the drainage ditches. Eventually, you come to a pleasant, sandy \"beach\", another delightful spot of \"wild country\" in this amazing public park. Continue ahead along a path which is boggy at first but climbs through more ancient oaks and birches to reach Little Bracebridge Pool. </p> <p>Go round the pool and turn left on a broad track before reaching the railway line that crosses the park, following it round through glades of oaks and stately beeches to emerge again at the Bracebridge Pool dam. </p> <p> Recommended caf\u00e9: The Boat House, Bracebridge Pool, Sutton Park. Further information from: Sutton Park Visitor Centre ( 0121 355 6370). </p> <p><strong> Tintagel, Cornwall</strong><br> </p> <p> The rocky headland on the north Cornish coast on which Tintagel Castle was built in the 12th century is now inescapably linked in the public mind with King Arthur. Indeed, the \"Arthurian Industry\" has taken a complete hold of the tiny north Cornish village. </p> <p>Our lane walk starts from the village car park in Fore Street, where you turn right and then right again into Atlantic Road. At the end, turn left past Gavercombe Farm towards the entrance of King Arthur's Castle Hotel, built on Fire Beacon Hill in 1899. Ahead, but still barred to walkers, lies Barras Nose, a fine viewpoint which was one of the first properties to be acquired by the National Trust in 1896. </p> <p>Retrace your steps to Fore Street and then turn right down Castle Road to reach Tintagel Haven straight ahead. You can descend (at low tide only) to the beach to inspect the legendary Merlin's Cave, where the baby Arthur was supposed to have been washed ashore. </p> <p>Back on the road, turn right to inspect the remains of the monastery and 12th- century castle, which formerly existed on rocky heights of The Island. Return to the \"mainland\" to visit the main castle ruins on the right, which date from the 14th century and were built by Edward the Black Prince, and where there is a shop and exhibition centre. Walk back up the rocky valley on Castle Road, back into Fore Street and then right up Vicarage Hill, which leads into Church Hill by the vicarage and on to the mainly Norman church of St Materiana. This unusual dedication probably refers to St Madryn, a 6th-century Welsh princess who brought Christianity to the area. </p> <p>Walk down Church Hill back into the village, turning right to walk along Fore Street to visit the Old Post Office, noting the two Dark Age granite crosses in front of the Wharncliffe Arms Hotel, before returning to your car. </p> <p> Recommended pub: Wharncliffe Arms Hotel, Fore Street, Tintagel.

      "bodyText": "There'll always be an England While there's a country lane. The Dunkirk spirit of Hughie Charles's Second World War song seems to echo the current situation on walking in the countryside during the foot and mouth crisis. Britain is blessed with an abundance of country lanes, and, as long as walkers abide by the rule of the road - avoid the dangerous \"rat-runs\" increasingly used by nouveau-rural, 4x4-mounted townies, they should be safe. In addition to lane and village walking, there are also still some areas of parkland, coast and open country which have remained open to walkers. Here are some suggestions: Castleton, Derbyshire Castleton stands on the Great Divide of Peak District geology - on the junction between the limestone White Peak and the gritstone Dark Peak. It also boasts two of the Peak's ancient Seven Wonders, first extolled in the 17th century - Peak Cavern, the largest cave entrance in Britain, and Mam Tor, the \"Shivering Mountain\" on the outskirts of the village, which is at present still barred from access. But there is much more to Castleton than its \"Wonders,\" as this short village walk will show. Starting from the main car park, turn left into Cross Street and then right opposite the Bull's Head pub into Castle Street. A few yards up here on the left is the gateway to St Edmund's Parish Church, one of the oldest and most interesting in the Peak. The zig-zag decorated Norman chancel arch echoes exactly that of the entrance to Peveril Castle, on the crag above, perhaps indicating the same architect. From the church, walk up to the Market Place, where a path in the corner (signposted) leads up a steep path to Peveril Castle, built by William Peveril shortly after the Conquest to oversee his hunting and lead mining interests in the Royal Forest of the Peak. Unfortunately, as access leads through grazing land, the castle remains closed. Turn right down the lane to Goosehill Bridge, turning left on to the path which leads to the yawning entrance of Peak Cavern. Recommended pub: The Castle, Castle Street, Castleton.

Here is a quick guide to some British cities that you may not have thought of visiting recently. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> Hotel du Vin &amp; Bistro, The Sugar House, Narrow Lewins Mead (0117 925 5577, <a href=\"http://www.hotelduvin.com\">www.hotelduvin.com</a>). </p> <p> Set in a Grade II-listed former sugar refinery in the city centre, the hotel's large, New York loft style, cream and black rooms are smart and modern, with leather armchairs, free standing baths, showers so huge you could get lost and vast, custom made beds complete with Egyptian cotton sheets. Don't come for the views, though; the hotel may be set on the waterfront, but the tall ships that once stood outside have been replaced with concrete and Tarmac. The hotel's bar is trendy but comfortable, with a snooker table and walk-in cigar humidor; a three course meal in the candle-filled bistro costs around \u00a325. Double rooms from \u00a3109. </p> <p> <strong> On the town: </strong> The newly opened Rock, housed in a converted cinema on Frogmore Street, is home to Bristol's beautiful people. One of the best sound systems in the country has attracted DJ luminaries such as Boy George, Seb Fontaine, Paul Oakenfold and Judge Jules. </p> <p> <strong> Don't forget to: </strong> Oh, go on then, walk if you must - along the stunning Clifton Suspension bridge for views of the Avon Gorge, then back through bijou Clifton Village, packed with tearooms, boutiques, bookshops and restaurants. Recuperate at the wonderfully laid-back Boston Tea Party on Park Street. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> Lace Market Hotel, 29-31 High Pavement, The Lace Market (reservations: 0800 1698817, <a href=\"http://www.planethotels.com\">www.planethotels.com</a>). </p> <p> Regency on the outside but younger on the inside, the smart but unpretentious Lace Market Hotel is Nottingham's first boutique hotel, set in the vibrant, newly-developed area of the same name. The 29 individually decorated rooms retain period features, including fireplaces and floor to ceiling windows (some with stunning views of St Mary's Church) and all the mod-cons you could wish for. The bathrooms are to die for, with sheer glass sinks, huge walk in showers and good sized tubs, complete with mountains of Molton Brown goodies and a silver platter of artfully arranged lemons for when you're feeling fruity. The restaurant, Merchant's, is so popular you're advised to book in advance, but the hotel doesn't stand on ceremony when it comes to breakfast with home comforts such as beans on toast and porridge with double cream. Doubles from \u00a379. </p> <p> <strong> On the town: </strong> Rev yourself up with cocktails in the hotel's lounge, then hit Media on Queen Street, winner of the Ericsson Muzik magazine Venue of the Year award and one of the UK's glammest superclubs. </p> <p> <strong> Don't forget to: </strong> Sober up at the Galleries of Justice on Shire Hall High Pavement, an old style Chamber of Horrors with plenty of user friendly interactive tricks and spine chilling reminders of what happened to Nottingham residents of days gone by when they stepped out of line. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> The Point, 34 Bread Street (0131-221 5555; <a href=\"http://www.point-hotel.co.uk\">www.point-hotel.co.uk</a>). </p> <p> Set in a former Co-op department store, this is the place to stay in Edinburgh. An almost intimidatingly trendy reception - all white walls and steel pillars - The Point was doing the fluorescent lighting thing way before Ian Schrager caught on. In stark contrast to the shimmering corridors, the white rooms are warm and restful, with walnut furniture and postcard views of the Castle. Beds big enough to throw a party in and a double Jacuzzi with leatherette headrests make it perfect for a naughty weekend; the ground floor restaurant and bar mean you don't have to go out unless you really, really want to. Doubles from \u00a395. </p> <p> <strong> On the town: </strong> Hang out in George Street, home to a number of clubs and bars. The Maghreb-themed Po na na (43b Frederick Street) is the place to go for late night vodka and Red Bulls, while Espionage (4 India Buildings, Victoria Street) offers massed drinking over four levels. Rose Street, the one with all the pubs in, is only a block away if you fancy drinking games. </p> <p> <strong> Don't forget to: </strong> Pay a visit to the Dean Gallery, housed in Thomas Hamilton's 19th century Dean Orphan Hospital on Belford Road. This huge neoclassical building is home to a permanent collection of work by sculptor Sir Eduardo Paolozzi as well as changing exhibitions in the upstairs gallery. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> Hotel Pelirocco, 10 Regency Square (01273 327 055; <a href=\"http://www.hotelpelirocco.co.uk\">www.hotelpelirocco.co.uk</a>). </p> <p> Behind the Regency fa\u00e7ade, the 18 individually themed rooms are very rock'n'roll. Couples can choose from one of the hotel's sexier rooms, including the 1950s style Betty's Boudoir, featuring lashings of leopard print and a spa bath for two, or Absolute Love with its velvet chaise longues and heart shaped headboard. Mad-fer-it clubbers should go for one of the hotel's more eccentric options -the Muhammad Ali room is decked out like a boxing ring; the Dotty Room, dedicated to Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, features orange and black polka dotted walls; and Sugar Glider boasts pale blue walls painted with fluffy clouds and flying teapots. </p> <p>The bar is open until 4am at weekends, but the fun doesn't stop there; each room comes equipped with a Sony PlayStation. Doubles from \u00a370. </p> <p> <strong> On the town: </strong> It' s got to be Concorde II on the seafront, home to Brighton's best club night, Boutique (previously the Big Beat Boutique) - if you're lucky you might even catch local DJ Fatboy Slim on the decks. </p> <p> <strong> Don't forget to: </strong> Shop in the North Lanes, home to funky little boutiques, flea markets, record stores and more. Look out for Pussy, purveyors of kitsch and sexy interiors, Minky for all the latest men's and women's labels and One Forty Five for laid-back streetwear. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> Eleven Didsbury Park, Didsbury Village, Manchester (0161-448 7711; <a href=\"http://www.elevendidsburypark.com\">www.elevendidsburypark.com</a>). </p> <p> A converted Victorian residence in an affluent suburb of Manchester, Eleven Didsbury Park bills itself as a contemporary town house hotel, complete with a walled garden out back and an honesty bar in the lounge. The 14 off white rooms have enormous beds complete with aubergine bedspreads, huge padded headboards, CD players and lashings of dark wood. If you want to eat in, a simple deli style menu of sandwiches and pasta is served in the small lounge while the Irish breakfasts are huge and unmissable. Conveniently located for the airport and away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, the hotel uses its leafy location to full effect. If you want to eat out, there's a shuttle service to the restaurant of your choice in Didsbury, while a 15 minute cab ride will take you into town. Doubles from \u00a369.50. </p> <p> <strong> On the town: </strong> Begin your night at The Restaurant Bar &amp; Grill on John Dalton Street, which has been packed with Manchester's movers and shakers since its January opening, then head to Loaf on Deansgate Locks or The Living Room (80 Deansgate) for the trendiest tipples in town. </p> <p> <strong> Don't forget to: </strong> Drop into the Lowry Centre, billed as the Guggenheim of the north-west. Set on Salford Quays at the heart of the city's waterways, the centre houses two theatres, numerous exhibition spaces, restaurants and shops as well as Artworks, an interactive gallery designed to get your creative juices flowing. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> 42 The Calls (0113 244 0099; <a href=\"http://www.42thecalls.co.uk\">www.42thecalls.co.uk</a>). </p> <p> A converted flour mill with old beams, lovely views of the canal and a very convenient location opposite Tetley's Brewery, 42 The Calls has played host to all manner of celebs including Vinnie Jones, James Brown, Robbie Williams and Baby Spice. Original period features such as cast-iron pillars and even the odd hoist used for hauling grain from the quayside have been slickly blended with the cream painted brick walls and bold colour schemes. Rooms are individually designed with fresh lilies, bowls of fruit and barley sugars, CD player and satellite TV. The handmade beds are super comfy - ideal for southern softies - and the bathrooms come equipped with wonderfully thick towels, bathrobes so huge you won't be able to fit them in your suitcase and posh smellies. If you want to eat in, there's a brasserie and the Michelin-starred Pool Court restaurant. </p> <p> <strong> On the town: </strong> A bewildering number of clubs and bars per square foot mean you'll be spoilt for choice. Begin the night at the tiny Fudge Bar or The Townhouse in the Corn Exchange then dance the night away at The Fruit Cupboard on Call Lane, staggering distance from the hotel. </p> <p> <strong> Don't forget to: </strong> Shop till you drop at Leeds' own branch of London superstore Harvey Nicks. Credit cards at the ready in the Victoria Quarter, home to a number of men's and women's boutiques, including Vivienne Westwood, with branches of designer emporiums Joseph and Flannels nearby.</p>",

Had his pet Chinese Shar-Pei passed on to doggy paradise? Or were the Plovdiv mafia after him? </p> <p>The mournful demeanour of the rep on the coach from Bulgaria's Sofia airport hinted at hidden sorrow. It wasn't hacking sobs, snotty-nosed, externalised grief, but nor was it exactly Hi-de-hi. If I was a psychiatrist, I'd say he suffered from clinical depression. </p> <p>So, what was the snow like? </p> <p>The snow is not so good at the bottom, but there is some at the top, he intoned sadly into the coach microphone. </p> <p>Good snow at the top, then, eh? </p> <p>No, I would not say it was good snow, he said, and the long, dark night of the Bulgarian soul enveloped us like a black shroud. </p> <p>The bad news was that the lower slopes of the ski resort of Borovets were denuded of snow. The good news was the gondola would whisk us high to the top of the mountain to the remaining snow. </p> <p>At the foot of the gondola, the bad news was that it was windy up top, and so the gondola was closed. At the bottom of the resort, we were looking at zero snow. The sun climbed higher in the sky. </p> <p>A little daunted, we trooped off to practise on the nursery slope, a football pitch-sized scum of browning slush. On the edge of it, a caterpillar-tracked slush-mover trudged up and down, moving the slush around the pitch. </p> <p>Our guide hove into view, not quite the Italian god of my first week's skiing in the French Alps or the haughty but dry-witted and screamingly funny English lady of a certain age of my second week in Andorra, more like a Balkan Arthur Daley. His name was, if memory serves, Arsenic. Arsenic wasn't a bad chap or a bad ski instructor. But the fates were against him. By now everyone else had clumped on to the football pitch. Dozens of us robotically performed the snow plough. Most of us were considerably better than snow plough level, but Arsenic said he was concerned about our safety. </p> <p>In fact, the main dangers had to do with the absence of snow. Like coming to a dead stop in the slush, or crashing into one of the beginners, or, worst, avoiding them and crashing into the caterpillar- tracked slush-mover. </p> <p>It was depressing. One sloughed through the slush and came to a soggy dead stop. People started peeling off their ski gear, because it was getting so hot. </p> <p>At lunchtime we wolfed down chicken and chips, washed down with beer. It was very, very cheap. Then came the good news: the gondola was now open. It took us high above Borovets, affording us wonderful views of the tips of the pine trees. There was no snow to be seen for miles. Higher and higher the gondola took us, until we could see the top of the mountain. It looked like a slaughtered Friesian cow, baring brown and white patches to the sky. The brown was rock, the white snow. All 10 centimetres of it. If that. </p> <p>There were three or four basic runs, which would have been OK, had we been the only people on the mountain. But the entire resort was zooming along the same tracks. Pretty soon, snow turned to slush and slush to brown rock. </p> <p>You dared not move off other people's tramlines in the slush in case you hit brown rock. The sun punched you in the face like a bully. </p> <p>Arsenic gathered us together for a warming drink of chocolate and brandy - a Bulgarian speciality. Well, actually, I had had it in both France and Andorra. It tasted both more alcoholic and more chocolate-ty in France and Andorra, but we politely went \"mmmm\". </p> <p>Arsenic hadn't got us together for a morale-booster. It was so that he could do his patter. \"You come to my village. All the food you can eat. Only \u00a310.\" </p> <p>His offer sounded incredibly cheap. But then so did he. I went for a swim in the pool in the main hotel. The water was chilly, the attendants glum. </p> <p>The rep with clinical depression went through the exciting things we could do in Borovets. He spent rather too long talking about accidents and medical emergencies. People started dropping off. </p> <p>That evening the almost empty resort echoed to the despairing cries of the restaurateurs. \"Twenty per cent off - come in, happy hour...\" Cheap neon lights hung in the night sky, lone and palely loitering. </p> <p>The sadness was unbearable. At a roadside stall I bought a banana and chocolate pancake for two lev - about 60 pence. While the girls were making the pancake, a Bulgarian car slumped to a full stop and noxious plastic fumes started boiling out from under the bonnet. Bon appetit. </p> <p>The beer was cheap. </p> <p>Had there been snow, Borovets could have been a laugh. Without it, it seemed more a suicide risk than a holiday resort. I left the next morning at 7am, to watch the war in Macedonia. </p> <p>I caught the same flight back as the others on the ski ing trip. There was a small fight in the check-in desk queue when someone knocked over someone else's skis. </p> <p>The others said the snow had got worse and on the final day the whole resort had been closed. Some of them had had a laugh, despite everything. One holiday-maker in particular had enjoyed himself so much that he had thrown his television set out of the window because he didn't want to go home. He had gone on an all-night bender and his girlfriend had asked everyone else: \"Have you seen him?\" So some people did have fun. </p> <p>The plane was late taking off, because the agent had underestimated the amount of passengers by 100. To solve the problem of not giving some 100 passengers meals, no adults got meals. The flight was hit by terrible air turbulence. On the way into Gatwick one passenger had an epileptic fit. </p> <p>Paramedics were called, but they hadn't arrived before I got off the plane. </p> <p>Other than the above, I would heartily recommend a skiing holiday in Bulgaria.</p>",

It even carries a signature, like the works of art. \"Oh, we just decided not to take that down,\" says the curator, explaining that the building used to be the police department's warehouse for seized drugs, and that this room was where they put all the cocaine. </p> <p>The signature on that target must surely have been Crockett and Tubbs - the cops in the hit 80s TV series Miami Vice, who kept the pimps, drugs and the mob at bay, while casually committing their own crimes of fashion. They don't quite have the artworld kudos of Gilbert and George but there should be a monument to them on the beach - pastel T-shirts, shades, espadrilles, fancy suits with sleeves rolled up and a glimpse of gun holster, because, ironically, their depiction of the sleazy glamour of Miami proved - at least to the satisfaction of the tourist industry - that crime pays. </p> <p>\"Oh yeah, Miami Vice really put South Beach back on the map - it started the whole regeneration,\" says a local caf\u00e9 owner, all tan, white teeth and eyeballs in the ultraviolet glow of the Mangoes club. The vice here is the fact that the staff - men and women - take it in turns to dance on the bar to an all-night cycle of Latin pop that pays homage, at least every half an hour, to Ricky Martin. \"Fifteen years ago it used to just be pensioners and criminals here. You'd take a cab just to go two blocks it was so unsafe.\" </p> <p>This town once had the highest murder rate in the US, and a majestic coke habit. It is hard to picture that now on South Beach, with its restored glory of Art Deco buildings - a string of cake-coloured blocks piped with neon and soothingly curved edges that basks in the more natural shades of the sand, palm trees and sunset. This is the heart of a trip to Miami: its sassy and often sleazy altar to the sun. </p> <p>Don Johnson doesn't need to police this adult Disneyland any more, but the beach life has retained its colourful characters: \"You wanna stroke my snake?\" asks a man as his pet slowly curls in the furnace of the early afternoon; thongs thin enough to floss your teeth with rollerblade by; Ferraris kerb crawl, while strains of dance, hip-hop and Latin music fight for attention, and stretch vehicles snarl the traffic in \"limo-lock\". And, as the afternoon's 15-minute tropical downpour begins, the khaki-shorted staff of The Tides Hotel arm themselves with umbrellas for the guests scuttling back in. </p> <p>Confident in its ability to distinguish itself in such rich surroundings, The Tides (one of six \"Island Outpost\" hotels on South Beach owned by Chris Blackwell of Island Records) describes itself casually as \"across the street from the Atlantic Ocean\". Designed in 1936 by L Murray Dixon, its original 115-room layout has been knocked through to provide 45 more spacious suites, all of which have a view of the beach (and telescopes to magnify it). Compared with the more obviously designer cool of (ex Studio 54 partner) Ian Schrager's Delano, or Blackwell's own more funky Marlin (interior designed by Barbara Hulanicki, and home to the 72-track South Beach Studios), The Tides's strict decor of steel, khaki, cream, marble, nautical portholes and frosted glass is, in South Beach terms, understatedly luxurious. </p> <p>There is nothing that hasn't been given The Tides stamp. Somebody, somewhere, even has the job of etching the \"T\" logo into the sand of every ashtray in the building. You can only marvel at this holistic service and wonder, as you request a cappuccino and different music in the swimming pool, what frantic activity is going on behind the scenes. The heart of South Beach is used to dealing with the glamorous and the peculiar - and part of the Miami experience is pushing the boat out and feeling famous for a day. </p> <p>Lines count for a lot in Miami: the lines between vice and virtue, the VIPs and the ordinary folk, between Latin America and the US, taste and vulgarity. The celebrity second-homers like to draw the line at exclusivity and privacy, obsessions readily catered for by the islands that satellite the tip of Miami Beach (Fisher Island and Star Island are home to the likes of Gloria Estefan, Oprah and Boris Becker). </p> <p>Outside the nightclubs of South Beach, the lines continue to be drawn, but by red velvet ropes and bouncers; at Level or Crobar, people groom themselves and flutter fragrantly around the entrances, waiting to be picked out and ushered in -although in reality the queue is just ticking down like any other. Inside, VIP areas are placed like the top layer of a wedding cake, so the privileged few can observe the bouncing mass below. Fickle, fun and absolutely to be taken at face value, these are the super clubs - the glamour factories that, since the infamous Liquid opened in 1996, have put Miami on the dance music scene. Every March, they play host to the Winter Music Festival, making America's own little Ibiza for a month. </p> <p>In typical American fashion, you generally get a bit extra, wherever you go. There's the laundrette that also has a bar (a favourite lesbian hangout); there's Bed, the restaurant that serves you a gourmet dinner in bed before throwing back the covers to turn into a nightclub; or Tantra, a restaurant and club with grass on the floor, water trickling down the walls and a menu of entirely aphrodisiac food. Power Studios, with its nine different rooms and stages covering everything from rooftop cinema, house music, jazz, salsa, dance and food - goes for a full immersion in the arts, and is a fine place to watch Miami's Latin and American flavours (and people) fuse. </p> <p>Developer Craig Robins, who had been part of South Beach's return to form is doing similar things with the Design District, which is being labelled a South Beach for shoppers, and top designers, artists and restaurateurs - as well as nightlife generators such as Power Studios - are moving back into what was a thriving area in the 1970s. </p> <p>There are locals, however, who feel that Miami has lost it - that the bubble has burst and left a hollow playground.

      "body": "<p>On this day 199 years ago, Dorothy Wordsworth walked to Portinscale, west of Keswick, and \"lay upon the turf and saw into the Vale of Newlands\". She tells in her journals how she looked up to Borrowdale and down to Keswick and described what she saw as a \"soft venetian view\". Last weekend we saw what she saw but were still puzzling over how she could compare a lonely Lake District valley with Venice when, having walked south from the hamlet of Braithwaite, we met the black plastic bucket. </p> <p>We had sniffed disinfectant in the crisp morning air and then came across a soggy, cleansing mat on the road; next to it sat the bucket. Two shivering volunteer national park wardens asked us to dip our boots. As we did, we glanced across to the adjacent field where a contented ewe was nuzzling her new-born triplets. We tried not to think how much longer she and her lambs would have in this world and strode off on a tarmac walk, which is just about the only walk you can do in the Lake District at present. (But don't try walking over the Hardknott and Wrynose passes: they are closed.) </p> <p>If you have to walk on roads, the lane that ambles down to Stoneycroft and Rigg Beck and back through Little Town and Swinside makes a satisfying six-mile circuit if you can hide your eyes from the keep out signs on every stile and from the tracks that lead invitingly up to Causey Pike and the wild hinterland of the fells. </p> <p>On the way out there was Catbells to the east and just a glimpse of Derwent Water; ahead lay High Crags and beyond that, Great Gable. A cautious sun in a big sky made the prospect more Turner than Venice. We turned east by a purple house that looked like a reject from Psycho and eventually headed north, gazing towards Skiddaw and Blencathra while wondering what to do about the errant Herdwick sheep that trotted resolutely along the road in front of us. </p> <p>So the Lake District is open and anyone involved in the tourism business should be able to offer the kind of warm welcome we received at the Lairbeck Hotel in Keswick, which we had plucked more or less at random from a website: a large, comfortable double room for \u00a331.50, as many mint imperials as you can swallow and the chance of a game of Scrabble with the owners in a bar warmed by a roaring fire. </p> <p>We had made our way to Keswick from Windermere, dropping off first at the Steamboat Museum, a superb collection of varnished teak launches from the age of elegance, a century ago, when owners of grand lakeside homes vied with each other to show off the quality of their craft to ladies with parasols. We were torn between Branksome (the apotheosis of Victorian style) and Otto (built for speed), but neither was plying the lake (trips should start at Easter), so we took to the water on a cruise boat from Waterhead near Ambleside. </p> <p>Miss Cumbria II, did not, like the boat the young Wordsworth rowed, go \"heaving through the water like a swan\", but it returned us to Ambleside in time for a visit to Dove Cottage, up the road in Grasmere, the poet's home with Dorothy (and sundry other friends and relations, including Coleridge and De Quincey, both high as kites on laudanum) from 1799 to 1808. </p> <p>Foot and mouth has closed the garden that William and Dorothy made (and into which Walter Scott once did a bunk through an open window), but the cottage still exercises its strange, intense charm, especially when a fire blazes in the kitchen hearth and a vase of daffodils rests on a table by the window. There were just half a dozen people on our tour of the nine rooms, but that left both scope for romantic daydreams about the nature of genius and time to admire some of the cottage's magnificent floorboards. The ceiling in Dorothy's bedroom leaked, by the way. </p> <p>The nearby museum, with bare walls of local stone, was pretty empty, too, but that meant there were no queues for the headphones to hear readings of Upon Westminster Bridge and Tintern Abbey. It was enough to turn the sensitive visitor into what Wordsworth would have called a living soul. And there was a cheap, groupy kind of thrill in seeing the skates on which the poet could have glided across Esthwaite Lake in a famous passage in The Prelude. </p> <p>We met Wordsworth again at Rheged, near Penrith, one of Cumbria's newest tourist attractions where the county's \"history, mystery and magic\" are celebrated in Europe's largest earth-covered building. There are shops (everything Cumbrian), crafts, caf\u00e9s and play areas for children. But at Rheged's heart is a cinema with a huge screen on which is shown a film (narrated by Sir Derek Jacobi, no less) that dabbles in Celtic and Arthurian whimsy while telling the tale of an American lad who heads east to find his Cumbrian roots. </p> <p>Wordsworth and Dorothy make a slightly embarrassed arm-in-arm appearance because the lad turns out to be a descendant of the errant son of Michael, the hero of Wordsworth's long poem about a peasant shepherd and his incomplete pen for sheep (which may have had foot and mouth but it didn't seem to matter much in those days). </p> <p>Our diversion was a pint of Jennings bitter, excellent sausage and mash and a pile of fresh veg at the George in Keswick followed by Twelfth Night at the Theatre By The Lake, the town's loveable and successful theatre on the shores of Derwent Water.

      "bodyText": "On this day 199 years ago, Dorothy Wordsworth walked to Portinscale, west of Keswick, and \"lay upon the turf and saw into the Vale of Newlands\". She tells in her journals how she looked up to Borrowdale and down to Keswick and described what she saw as a \"soft venetian view\". Last weekend we saw what she saw but were still puzzling over how she could compare a lonely Lake District valley with Venice when, having walked south from the hamlet of Braithwaite, we met the black plastic bucket. We had sniffed disinfectant in the crisp morning air and then came across a soggy, cleansing mat on the road; next to it sat the bucket. Two shivering volunteer national park wardens asked us to dip our boots. As we did, we glanced across to the adjacent field where a contented ewe was nuzzling her new-born triplets. We tried not to think how much longer she and her lambs would have in this world and strode off on a tarmac walk, which is just about the only walk you can do in the Lake District at present. (But don't try walking over the Hardknott and Wrynose passes: they are closed.) If you have to walk on roads, the lane that ambles down to Stoneycroft and Rigg Beck and back through Little Town and Swinside makes a satisfying six-mile circuit if you can hide your eyes from the keep out signs on every stile and from the tracks that lead invitingly up to Causey Pike and the wild hinterland of the fells. On the way out there was Catbells to the east and just a glimpse of Derwent Water; ahead lay High Crags and beyond that, Great Gable. A cautious sun in a big sky made the prospect more Turner than Venice. We turned east by a purple house that looked like a reject from Psycho and eventually headed north, gazing towards Skiddaw and Blencathra while wondering what to do about the errant Herdwick sheep that trotted resolutely along the road in front of us. So the Lake District is open and anyone involved in the tourism business should be able to offer the kind of warm welcome we received at the Lairbeck Hotel in Keswick, which we had plucked more or less at random from a website: a large, comfortable double room for \u00a331.50, as many mint imperials as you can swallow and the chance of a game of Scrabble with the owners in a bar warmed by a roaring fire. We had made our way to Keswick from Windermere, dropping off first at the Steamboat Museum, a superb collection of varnished teak launches from the age of elegance, a century ago, when owners of grand lakeside homes vied with each other to show off the quality of their craft to ladies with parasols. We were torn between Branksome (the apotheosis of Victorian style) and Otto (built for speed), but neither was plying the lake (trips should start at Easter), so we took to the water on a cruise boat from Waterhead near Ambleside. Miss Cumbria II, did not, like the boat the young Wordsworth rowed, go \"heaving through the water like a swan\", but it returned us to Ambleside in time for a visit to Dove Cottage, up the road in Grasmere, the poet's home with Dorothy (and sundry other friends and relations, including Coleridge and De Quincey, both high as kites on laudanum) from 1799 to 1808. Foot and mouth has closed the garden that William and Dorothy made (and into which Walter Scott once did a bunk through an open window), but the cottage still exercises its strange, intense charm, especially when a fire blazes in the kitchen hearth and a vase of daffodils rests on a table by the window. There were just half a dozen people on our tour of the nine rooms, but that left both scope for romantic daydreams about the nature of genius and time to admire some of the cottage's magnificent floorboards. The ceiling in Dorothy's bedroom leaked, by the way. The nearby museum, with bare walls of local stone, was pretty empty, too, but that meant there were no queues for the headphones to hear readings of Upon Westminster Bridge and Tintern Abbey. It was enough to turn the sensitive visitor into what Wordsworth would have called a living soul. And there was a cheap, groupy kind of thrill in seeing the skates on which the poet could have glided across Esthwaite Lake in a famous passage in The Prelude. We met Wordsworth again at Rheged, near Penrith, one of Cumbria's newest tourist attractions where the county's \"history, mystery and magic\" are celebrated in Europe's largest earth-covered building. There are shops (everything Cumbrian), crafts, caf\u00e9s and play areas for children. But at Rheged's heart is a cinema with a huge screen on which is shown a film (narrated by Sir Derek Jacobi, no less) that dabbles in Celtic and Arthurian whimsy while telling the tale of an American lad who heads east to find his Cumbrian roots. Wordsworth and Dorothy make a slightly embarrassed arm-in-arm appearance because the lad turns out to be a descendant of the errant son of Michael, the hero of Wordsworth's long poem about a peasant shepherd and his incomplete pen for sheep (which may have had foot and mouth but it didn't seem to matter much in those days). Our diversion was a pint of Jennings bitter, excellent sausage and mash and a pile of fresh veg at the George in Keswick followed by Twelfth Night at the Theatre By The Lake, the town's loveable and successful theatre on the shores of Derwent Water. The production was more Ibiza than Ilyria, with much of the action taking place in Olivia's bar. There were no references to sheep (thank God they were not doing A Winter's Tale) and not a lot of depth-plumbing. But a full house enjoyed every minute, glad for a moment to forget a crisis that had prompted an angry farmer to erect on the outskirts of the town a sign reading, in blood-red paint, \"Drop dead Blair.\" The volunteer warden who had watched us dip our boots in the bucket near Braithwaite had commented gloomily: \"It [foot and mouth] is in the Duddon Valley now.\" Wordsworth loved the Duddon Valley and celebrated it in 34 sonnets: Still glides the stream, and shall for ever glide; The Form remains, the Function never dies; While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise, We Men, who in our morn of youth defied The elements, must vanish. By the time you read this, a Duddon flock of Herdwicks, the sheep Beatrix Potter loved, will have been slaughtered amid fears for the future ecology of the Lake District.

One of the most striking things about the profusion of shops selling flowers, interior design, chocolates, candy, shoes, clothes, cheeses and just about anything you could wish for, is the attention to detail. Cakes turn out to be exquisitely made from flowers, chocolate is fashioned into tea-pots, houses, carriages and more. Restaurants lay out small wrought-iron tables topped with simple, elegant terracotta pots bursting with bright flowers. Window dressing is considered an art form, a feast for the eyes. </p> <p>But it isn't just in the stores that this innate sense of accessorising, adorning and garnishing belongs. Coffee houses automatically provide a chocolate, a piece of waffle or a tempting square of cake with every order. In restaurants, children are given a tiny dish of smarties, a lollipop - anything to appeal or amuse - as a prelude to the meal. The first restaurant we ate at provided my six-year-old son with a salad \"garden\", complete with a toadstool, ingeniously made from a boiled egg and half a seeded tomato.

      "body": "<p>Many who enjoy skiing say that its attraction is the sensation of flying that can be achieved by making long, swooping turns. But skiing can bring you even closer to the birds, for those who dare to jump. </p> <p>Some professional skiers are actually jumping specialists. Nordic ski-jumpers need to have plenty of spring in their legs to generate distance, but they must also be of tiny physique, so as to be able to float down on the wind like a leaf. Aerialists can spin and somersault in the air- and if they belong to the \"New School\", they need to be able to take off and land backwards, or \"switch\". But many of these kings of the air are actually unable to perform an expert-level turn on the ground. </p> <p>Other athletes must combine terrestrial skiing skills with mastery in the air. Downhillers intermix 90mph turns with huge 50-yard flights, where the wind resistance alone threatens to flip them on to their backs. Freeskiers are able to intersperse jump turns on 50-degree steeps, with enormous drops off cliffs, occasionally with a somersault thrown in for style. </p> <p>But for average holiday skiers, the scope for jumping is more limited. They are unlikely ever to gain access to a nordic ski jump or an FIS downhill course, so their only opportunities to grab some air will be in the terrain park, or off-piste. </p> <p> <strong> Park jumps</strong> </p> <p> Most jumps, or \"hits\" in terrain parks are \"table-tops\", where a short flat section, followed in turn by a steeper-landing zone follows an upwards-facing \"kicker\". Once you jump, you'll soon learn that flat landings, with their high impact forces, are less pleasant than steep landings. So on tabletops, you need to fly far enough to clear the flat. If you're having difficulty doing this, you either need to carry more speed into the jump, or perform a stronger \"pop\" at the moment of take-off. </p> <p>\"Popping\" the jump means extending your legs forcefully for greater height. (The opposite of popping is \"absorbing\", where you bend your legs just at the moment of take-off; this is used by downhillers, who want to reduce their flight distance, it's also known as \"squashing\" or \"pressing\".) </p> <p>When you pop a tabletop, it's also important that you move your weight forwards, because you are going from an uphill gradient on the kicker, to a downhill gradient on the landing zone. If you don't move forward to align your body at right angles to the landing slope, you'll be leaning too far back, in relation to the slope, when you touch down. </p> <p>If you want to try some tricks, you must build up gradually. Spend a morning in the terrain park, learning the various hits and getting a feel for the necessary speed to clear the tabletops. Watch other skiers and riders: where they start their in-run, and where they land. Pick a hit you feel comfortable with. Concentrate on making a clean take-off to give yourself plenty of height, and only think about starting the trick once you're in the air. There's plenty to choose from, Old School such as \"spreadeagles\", \"daffys\"or \"backscratchers\", or New School such as \"mute\" or \"japan\". The key to maintaining mid-air balance is to balance every movement of the legs with an opposite movement of the upper body. </p> <p> <strong> Half-pipe</strong> </p> <p> No longer is it purely the preserve of snowboarders. In fact, there are just as many skiers having fun in the halfpipe nowadays. Again, start gradually, just going halfway up the \"wall\", and hopping your skis around. Try to go higher and higher. Once you're ready to jump out of the pipe, be aware that the timing of the pop is everything. Pop too early, and you'll land back inside the pipe, on the flat. Pop too late, and you may fly out of the pipe entirely. But once you time it right, you'll fly vertically upwards, spin through 180 degrees, and touch back down smoothly, just inside the lip. Once you're getting enough height and \"hang time\", you can try some sim ple tricks like a mute or indy grab. Or, you can attempt the \"alley oop\", where you spin through 180 degrees in the \"wrong\" direction, ie opposite to your direction travel down the pipe. </p> <p> <strong> Off-piste jumping</strong> </p> <p> There are two types of jumps performed by serious off-piste freeskiers: cliff jumps and cornice jumps. The profile of both is similar: a vertical downward drop, as opposed to the upward kick of a terrain park jump. Checking out the landing area in advance is absolutely crucial. It must be steep enough and soft enough. If there has been a recent snowfall, check with locals whether there may be any hidden rocks or stumps, lurking just beneath the surface. If possible, watch other skiers or snowboarders to see how deep they sink in when they land. (But remember that snowboarders will sink in less than you will, if you are on skis. And old-fashioned \"straight skis\" will sink in more than fat skis.) Try to learn from watching others how much speed you'll need to clear the lower part of the cliff. Make sure a friend spots the landing for you, to check no one else is standing below. </p> <p>When standing above a cornice, don't get too close to the edge until you're actually ready to launch, because the snow could break away under your weight. And when you ski off the cliff or cornice, pick your feet up just before the lip to avoid snagging your skis on a piece of rock or having the cornice break away unexpectedly. You'll need to move your weight forward slightly to align yourself with the steep landing, but not too far forward or you may go \"over the handlebars\". Start modestly, with little 3ft drop-offs, and gradually build up to the bigger drops, when the snow conditions are soft enough. </p> <p>Enjoy your \"big air\" and happy landings!</p>",

      "body": "<p>Drifting slowly around Bora Bora at dusk in a 36ft catamaran, something caught my eye. On the edge of the island there was a simple weatherboard church, painted in sky blue and white with a small steeple. The building was completely isolated apart from a few people sitting nearby, their feet dangling langourously over a rickety, wooden jetty. </p> <p>The church was dwarfed by the mountain which climbed steeply behind it, seeming to ridicule the man-made attempt to pay homage to God. The church had also seen better days but had gained dignity with age. </p> <p>By now the water was a dark, deep blue and had lost the translucence and ribbons of different shades that rippled in the sea by day. But if you couldn't see them, you could still hear the fish splashing and you could see small white eruptions of spume as they flicked their tails and pierced the surface. </p> <p>The island itself had also turned dark green. Like the others in the Society Islands of French Polynesia, Bora Bora is densely covered with palm trees which climb up the peaks that shape their dramatic skylines - a kind of leafy Manhattan. The peaks themselves were lost amid dark clouds that seemed to huddle over the islands for fear of getting lost in the vast expanse of ocean and blue sky that surrounds them in every direction. </p> <p>The sun was going down behind the island and throwing sparks of light through the gaps between cloud and mountain peak. The hum of the boat was the only sound to keep me company and the only other visible sign of life was the odd whisp of smoke escaping from between the treetops where I imagined people were lighting fires for the night. </p> <p>The silence was then broken as the crew of the boat began singing with a collection of makeshift instruments including the spoons, an empty can of the local brew filled with stones and an ageing ukulele. The church got smaller and finally disappeared as we turned the corner to follow the shore of the island. I ordered a gin and tonic and sunk into the evening. Perfect. </p> <p>For most people, the Tahiti they travel half the world to see is the stuff of textbook paradise. And that Tahiti exists. Long lines of tiny cartoon-style islands (known locally as motus ) fit for a castaway - the kind of scene that makes you blink in disbelief. A cluster of palm trees surrounded by white sand and in turn surrounded by water that looks like blue cut glass. Arriving from London, it was like emerging from black and white into splendid technicolour. Honeymooners laze about in the classic low-rise luxury hotels spreading into the sea on stilts like an exoskeleton from the islands. </p> <p>But it was a different Tahiti that I wanted to see. One that was at once exotic in the old-fashioned kind of way and chic from the long influence of the French: light but also excitingly dark and gothic. I'd grown up with a couple of places in mind that fitted the bill coming from no more highbrow a source than Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. The experience of drifting past Bora Bora at dusk felt as though I was in an old movie circling unexplored lands. </p> <p>I'd arrived, as all visitors to the Society Islands do, on Tahiti, the main island of the region which supports most of the otherwise sparse population. Staying at the Sheraton, not far from the airport, the exotic required a little work on my part. Not least when lying next to the pool. To the left was the view of neighbouring volcanic island Moorea, to the right, the industrial port of Tahiti's capital, Papeete. </p> <p>But even on Tahiti it was relatively easy to escape by moving off the main road circling the island and heading inland. Tahitians have a taste for the beach life and cling on to the edges of the islands leaving the interiors virtually unspoilt. My guide for a trek through the jungle was a Frenchman bearing a striking resemblance to Gerard Depardieu, who swung his machete with rather too much abandon, encouraged me to wade through rivers fully clothed and eat avocados recently dropped to the ground. </p> <p>It was only once I had left Tahiti that I became seduced by the islands. The cruise was a five day sojourn around the main Society Islands including Bora Bora, Tahaa and Huahine. We were following an annual race, the Hawaiki Nui Va'a - a gruelling three day boat race between the islands in which 90 outrigger canoe teams take part. </p> <p>For the islanders it is the biggest social occasion of the year. A large flotilla follows the race, from small, brightly-coloured speed boats peeling with paint and overflowing with families to large luxury yachts, including the president's. As the race progresses, the drinks come out and men and women alike start to strip off and position themselves to catch the sun while taking the occasional glimpse at who's winning. The race also underlined the sheer drama of the place - boats cross in the paths of the competing canoes in what seems like aquatic games of chicken while officials dart about on jet skis, and helicopters hover overhead with camera crews. And all the time in the background are those looming, mountainous islands. </p> <p>The race is designed to underline the links between the islands, but for me only emphasised their isolation from the rest of the world. French Polynesia is more than 3,300 miles from Sydney to the west, 3,500 miles to Los Angeles in the north and 4,000 miles to Santiago in the east - a fact that lends the islands an intensity at odds with the laid-back nature of the people. </p> <p>The seduction wasn't only visual. The reliance on local produce means you literally taste the place - and it is a good taste. The staple diet is fish and vegetables, some familiar, others, like the bread fruit or black root vegetable taro, less so. Thankfully, the French influence is evident in the food preparation but not the portions. When someone talks about \"Tahitian portions\" they mean large. Tahitians enjoy life. </p> <p>One morning of the cruise, I woke at dawn to go spear fishing for mahi mahi, the local blue-finned tuna, and sped through choppy waters on a speed boat, clinging on for life. The only way to stay on board was to stand and grip a bar behind the man in charge of the wheel, an experience much like skiing over moguls, your feet leaving the deck as the boat momentarily becomes airborne at the crest of every wave. </p> <p>The fisherman spotted his prey by watching for birds skimming the surface. As we finally found one, it was a case of cowering as the boat virtually turned in circles on its side. The driver knew only two words of English, which he used when the eight-pronged spear finally found its mark. \"Game over.\" The long haul back to the island, where the catamaran was anchored reminded me of the scene in the Hobbit when the nearer they got to the dragon's mountain, the further away it seemed. </p> <p>The seduction was tactile, too. We stopped at an enclosure off one of the islands where you could swim with and feed the fish. It was there that I learnt stingrays' wings have the texture of mushrooms. </p> <p>In some ways, Tahiti is like Cuba, a society which a visiting European can believe, with glassy eyes, harks back to more innocent days. The buses are 1950s trucks fitted out with wooden benches and often decorated by the flowers which have dropped from behind ears. The sight of kids playing on the mooring ropes of a large French navy ship docked in one of the islands' small ports elicited similar thoughts - as did the twin engine planes seating 16 people that fly between the islands and land on dirt-track airstrips. </p> <p>To talk of an innocence though is, perhaps, too patronising, For this is a sophisticated society with a nice line in ironic humour - one that has resisted the complete bulldozing by American culture. </p> <p>But in truth, probably the best thing about the noirish nature of the islands is that it was more a case of their effect on my imagination than anything really sinister. </p> <p>In hushed tones, Taina, a guide from Tahiti tourism told me about the curse put on her uncle. An arresting woman in her 30s with long, thick, black hair, Taina was brought up on Tahiti but her family was from the more remote Rimatera, part of the Australs, which a local archaeologist said is more like stepping into the last century than the 1950s. Taina's uncle had returned to the island to reclaim some land which the family had owned but fell ill when he came back. For three weeks doctors failed to reach a diagnosis and finally the local priest was called in for an exorcism. It worked. </p> <p>Taina offered a Gallic shrug of her shoulders. \"I would like to go back there one day, but I'm scared,\" she said with apparent good reason. In Rimatera, so the story goes, recently buried bodies are regularly dug up to make sure they haven't turned into evil giant birds. Now that would be a real adventure into the unknown. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong><br> </p> <p> The most economical time to visit Tahiti is between April and June, when the weather is also good.

But they have been told they can keep the money, worth an average of \u00a36,500 each, this year. And 300 more schools have been told they will get awards after all. \"It is bizarre,\" said John Ritchie, head teacher of Harton junior in South Shields, whose school was handed \u00a311,200 in error. \"I don't think we are going to lose any sleep over it but it's a very strange situation to be in.\" Results at Harton junior have showed big improvements, including a 20% increase in those obtaining level four in maths last year. He expects the money will be divided between all his 19 teachers, three classroom assistants and two secretarial staff. Most of the schools wrongly awarded had improved their scores, but not by enough to qualify for an award. But Mr Ritchie said he felt sorry for those schools who had missed out on the money and were no less deserving. \"Its a terribly unfair way to run an education system.\" Ms Morris said: \"As soon as the error was brought to my attention this week, I wanted to act quickly to put things right. \"I want to make sure that those schools that qualified for an award but were not on the recent list should receive one as quickly as possible.\" The mistake was made by miscalculating the school's average point score in 1997's key stage two tests. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"Maybe the department should have its own literacy hour.\"",

      "body": "<p>On the evening of Friday October 25 1946, the Cambridge Moral Science Club - a discussion group for the university's philosophers and philosophy students - held a meeting. The members assembled in King's College at 8.30pm, in a set of rooms in the Gibbs Building - number three on staircase H. </p> <p>Although its tenant was a don, Richard Braithwaite, H3 was just as neglected as the other rooms in the building, squalid, dusty and dirty. Heating was dependent on open fires and the inhabitants protected their clothes with their gowns when humping sacks of coal. </p> <p>That evening, the guest speaker was Dr Karl Popper, up from London to deliver an innocuous-sounding paper, Are There Philosophical Problems?. Among his audience was the chairman of the club, Professor Ludwig Wittgenstein, considered by many to be the most brilliant philosopher of his time. Also present was Bertrand Russell, who for decades had been a household name as a philosopher and radical campaigner. </p> <p>Popper had recently been appointed to the position of reader in logic and scientific method at the London School of Economics. The Open Society and Its Enemies, his remorseless demolition of totalitarianism, had just been published in England. It had immediately won him a select group of admirers, among them Russell. </p> <p>This was the only time these three great philosophers - Russell, Wittgenstein and Popper - were together. Yet, to this day, no one can agree precisely what took place. What is clear is that there were vehement exchanges between Popper and Wittgenstein over the fundamental nature of philosophy. These instantly became the stuff of legend. An early version of events had Popper and Wittgenstein battling for supremacy with red-hot pokers. </p> <p>In Popper's account, found in his intellectual autobiography, Unended Quest, published in 1974, more than two decades after Wittgenstein's death, he put forward a series of what he insisted were real philosophical problems. Wittgenstein summarily dismissed them all. Popper recalled that Wittgenstein \"had been nervously playing with the poker\", which he used \"like a conductor's baton to emphasise his assertions\", and when a question came up about the status of ethics, Wittgenstein challenged him to give an example of a moral rule. \"I replied: 'Not to threaten visiting lecturers with pokers.' Whereupon Wittgenstein, in a rage, threw the poker down and stormed out.\" </p> <p>Those 10 or so minutes in October 1946 still provoke bitter disagreement. Above all, one dispute remains heatedly alive: did Karl Popper lie in his published account of the meeting? </p> <p>If he did, it was no casual embellishing of the facts but directly concerned two ambitions central to his life: the defeat at a theoretical level of fashionable 20th-century linguistic philosophy and triumph at a personal level over Wittgenstein, the sorcerer who had dogged his career. </p> <p>To an outsider, a violent confrontation between Wittgenstein and Popper might have seemed implausible. They were both Jews from Vienna and, superficially, they had in common a civilisation - and its dissolution. Although Wittgenstein was the older by 13 years, they had shared the cultural excitement of the last years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They had in common, too, the impact on their lives of the lost first world war, the attempt to raise a modern republic on the ruins of the monarchy, the descent into the corporate state, and the maelstrom of Hitler and Nazism. With their Jewish origins, interest in music, contacts with cultural radicals, training as teachers, and their connections with the fountainhead of logical positivism, the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein and Popper had many potential links. That they had never met was remarkable. </p> <p>Of the great figures in 20th-century philosophy, only a very few have given their names to those who follow in their path. That one can be identified as a Popperian or a Wittgensteinian is a testament to the originality of these philosophers' ideas and the power of their personalities. Those extraordinary qualities were on display in H3. The thrust of the poker becomes a symbol of the two men's unremitting zeal in their search for the right answers to the big questions. </p> <p>Three years after Popper's death, a memoir published in the proceedings of one of Britain's most learned bodies, the British Academy, recounted essentially Popper's version of events. It brought down a storm of protest on the head of the author, Popper's successor at the LSE, Professor John Watkins, and sparked off an acerbic exchange of letters in the Times Literary Supplement. A fervent Wittgenstein supporter who had taken part in the meeting, Professor Peter Geach, denounced Popper's account of the meeting as \"false from beginning to end\". A robust correspondence followed as other witnesses or later supporters of the protagonists piled into the fray. </p> <p>There was a delightful irony in the conflicting testimonies. They had arisen between people all professionally concerned with theories of epistemology (the grounds of knowledge), understanding and truth. Yet they concerned a sequence of events where those who disagreed were eyewitnesses on crucial questions of fact. </p> <p>But why was there such anger over what took place more than half a century before, in a small room, at a regular meeting of an obscure university club, during an argument over an arcane topic? </p> <p>Of the 30 present that night, nine, now in their 70s or 80s, responded by letter, phone and, above all, email from across the globe to appeals for memories of that evening. Their ranks include a former English high court judge, Sir John Vinelott. There are five professors. Professor Peter Munz had come to St John's from New Zealand and returned home to become a notable academic. His book, Our Knowledge of the Search for Knowledge, opened with the poker incident: it was, he wrote, a \"symbolic and in hindsight prophetic\" watershed in 20th-century philosophy. </p> <p>Professor Stephen Toulmin is an eminent philosopher, co-author of a demanding revisionist text on Wittgenstein, placing his philosophy in the context of Viennese culture and fin de si\u00e8cle intellectual ferment. As a young King's research fellow, he turned down a post as assistant to Karl Popper. </p> <p>Geach, an authority on logic, lectured at Birmingham University, and then at Leeds. Professor Michael Wolff specialised in Victorian England, and his academic career took him to the US. Peter Gray-Lucas became an academic and then switched to business, first in steel, then photographic film, then papermaking. Stephen Plaister became a classics master. </p> <p>\"Consider this poker,\" Geach hears Wittgenstein demand of Popper, picking up the poker and using it in a philosophical example. But, as the discussion rages on between them, Wittgenstein is not reducing the guest to silence (the impact he is accustomed to), nor the guest silencing him (ditto). Finally, and only after having challenged assertion after assertion made by Popper, Wittgenstein gives up. At some stage he must have risen to his feet, because Geach sees him walk back to his chair and sit down. He is still holding the poker. With a look of great exhaustion, he leans back in his chair and stretches out his arm towards the fireplace. The poker drops on to the tiles of the hearth with a little rattle. At this point Geach's attention is caught by the host, Braithwaite. Alarmed by Wittgenstein's gesticulating with the poker, he is making his way in a crouching position through the audience. He picks up the poker and somehow makes away with it. Shortly afterwards, Wittgenstein rises to his feet and, in a huff, quietly leaves the meeting, shutting the door behind him. </p> <p>Wolff sees that Wittgenstein has the poker idly in his hand and, as he stares at the fire, is fidgeting with it. Someone says something that visibly annoys Wittgenstein. By this time Russell has become involved. Wittgenstein and Russell are both standing. Wittgenstein says: \"You misunderstand me, Russell. You always misunderstand me.\" </p> <p>Russell says: \"You're mixing things up, Wittgenstein. You always mix things up.\" </p> <p>Munz watches Wittgenstein suddenly take the poker - red hot - out of the fire and gesticulate with it angrily in front of Popper's face. Then Russell takes the pipe out of his mouth and says firmly: \"Wittgenstein, put down that poker at once!\" </p> <p>Wittgenstein complies, then, after a short wait, gets up and walks out, slamming the door. </p> <p>From Gray-Lucas's standpoint, Wittgenstein seems to be growing very excited about what he obviously believes is Popper's improper behaviour and is waving the poker about. Wittgenstein is acting in \"his usual grotesquely arrogant, self-opinionated, rude and boorish manner. It made a good story afterwards to say that he had 'threatened' Popper with a poker.\" </p> <p>Plaister, too, sees the poker raised. It really seems to him the only way to deal with Popper, and he has no feeling of surprise or shock. To Toulmin, sitting only six feet from Wittgenstein, nothing at all out of the ordinary is occurring. He is focusing on Popper's attack on the idea that philosophy is meaningless and his production of various examples. A question about causality arises and at that point Wittgenstein picks up the poker to use as a tool in order to make a point about causation. Later in the meeting - after Wittgenstein has left - he hears Popper state his poker principle: that one should not threaten visiting lecturers with pokers. </p> <p> Vinelott alone sees the crucial point - whether Popper makes what was probably an attempt at a joke to Wittgenstein's face - in Popper's way. Vinelott hears Popper utter his poker principle and observes that Wittgenstein is clearly annoyed at what he thinks is an unduly frivolous remark. Wittgenstein leaves the room abruptly, but there is no question of the door being slammed. </p> <p>The debate continues and the story has achieved the status, if not of an urban myth, then at least of an ivory-tower fable. The story goes beyond the characters and beliefs of the antagonists. It is also the story of the schism in 20th-century philosophy over the significance of language: a division between those who diagnosed traditional philosophical problems as purely linguistic entanglements and those who believed that these problems transcended language. In the end, of course, it is the story of a linguistic puzzle in itself: to whom did Popper utter what words in that room full of witnesses, and why? </p> <p>And what of the sine qua non of this story? The fate of the poker remains a mystery. Many have searched for it in vain. According to one report, Braithwaite disposed of it - to put an end to the prying of academics and journalists. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from Wittgenstein's Poker: the Story of a Ten- Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers, published on April 9 by Faber, price \u00a39.99.

The debate continues and the story has achieved the status, if not of an urban myth, then at least of an ivory-tower fable. The story goes beyond the characters and beliefs of the antagonists. It is also the story of the schism in 20th-century philosophy over the significance of language: a division between those who diagnosed traditional philosophical problems as purely linguistic entanglements and those who believed that these problems transcended language. In the end, of course, it is the story of a linguistic puzzle in itself: to whom did Popper utter what words in that room full of witnesses, and why? And what of the sine qua non of this story? The fate of the poker remains a mystery. Many have searched for it in vain. According to one report, Braithwaite disposed of it - to put an end to the prying of academics and journalists. \u0095 This is an edited extract from Wittgenstein's Poker: the Story of a Ten- Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers, published on April 9 by Faber, price \u00a39.99.

      "body": "<p>Colin Firth says everything is all right. Really, it's fine - as if someone just bumped the back of his Volkswagen. \"I don't mind it at all.\" He's talking a bit like Gareth Southgate does when the subject of penalties crops up. </p> <p>\"I think I've been saying all the time: 'It's all right. It's fine.' How convincing can you be when you say, 'I'm not het up'?\"</p> <p>The thing Firth is fine about (so we can all stop feeling guilty) is being a Sex God. He doesn't mind the tight breeches thing, or having to talk in detail about That Pond Scene for the past six years, or knowing that millions of women fantasise about the way his wet shirt clung to his chest, or the way his bushy sideburns fluttered outside Pemberley. \"If I spent 20 years training to be an astronaut, the headlines would still say Darcy Lands On Mars!,\" he says, laughing. But, to be honest, he looks pissed off.</p> <p>It really is six years since Firth was Mr Darcy in the television adaptation of Pride And Prejudice (indeed, he is probably the only person to whom it feels like six years). More than 13 million of us were glued to the BBC on those autumnal Sunday evenings, and the way Firth glowered and brooded, and looked intense, hurt, horny and, at times, as if someone had just farted. . . well, it was all too much. </p> <p>By the time he blurted out to Miss Bennet, \"My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you,\" millions had welled up into one collective wobbly bottom lip.</p> <p>Six years on, Firth is far removed from that small series. He is living in an Islington town house with his Italian wife, Livia Giuggiolo, 31. Their wedding, in 1997, was a blow to women everywhere, and now - I'm sorry to break this to you - Firth is excitedly awaiting the birth of their first child together (he has a son by a previous marriage), due any day now. If he fails to show up for any of the glitzy premieres for his latest film, Bridget Jones's Diary, it's because he is preoccupied with other things in a maternity ward. \"I'm absolutely over the moon. It's about to pop, and no one has sussed it,\" he says, revelling in the way he and his wife have ducked the tabloids. \"Ever since I met Livy, people have been speculating that she's pregnant and it's never been true. Now she's enormous and she's been in public but, weirdly, people stopped pursuing it.\"</p> <p>It is unlikely, then, that they'll be inviting Hello! into their \"fabulous home\". Firth is a reluctant star, to say the least. His career, he admits, has had \"no clear trajectory\": he loathes publicity and seems to fluctuate wildly in his work, between prominence and obscurity. More than anything, for so prolific an actor (at only 40, he has more than 30 films to his name), Firth has had a singular difficulty in being anyone other than Darcy in the nation's consciousness. </p> <p>Since Pride And Prejudice, he has appeared in high-profile productions such as Shakespeare In Love and The English Patient, but these supporting roles rendered him strangely forgettable. Another Country, with Rupert Everett, kick-started his career in 1984, and he achieved national prominence five years later in BBC1's controversial Falklands drama, Tumbledown. But his CV is peppered with questionable choices, such as My Life So Far, a rambling, directionless period piece, the likeable but amateurish Secret Laughter Of Women, and the absurdly hammy Relative Values. </p> <p>There are overlooked successes as well, such as his small but flawless role in A Thousand Acres, with Michelle Pfeiffer. Most people, however, would name him in Fever Pitch, the 1996 adaptation of Nick Hornby's book about football obsession that may have appealed to Firth as very unDarcyish but that owed much to the repressed-with-a-lot-going-on-beneath-the-surface Englishman that he plays so well. Essentially, though, tell anyone you're meeting Colin Firth and the response is the same: \"Ooooh, Darcy. Lovely.\" And what's wrong with being famous for something you were good in? Nothing, except </p> <p>Firth has a certain contempt for Darcy, his silly, heart-throb younger twin. The older, more serious Firth has stretched himself in far bigger roles: \"Pride And Prejudice wasn't the most rigorous or challenging thing I've done,\" he says. He told one interviewer he would \"not do that again. No, I'd be bored shitless.\" He tells me that Darcy \"was somebody else's party. I'm still trying to think it all through.\" It brought him fame for something he wasn't quite proud of: a sudden, bright, intrusive spell as public property. </p> <p>The global love affair with Pride And Prejudice (it was huge in the US) brought with it persistent press attention, not least when it emerged that he had been romantically involved with his leading lady, Jennifer Ehle. \"They only discovered it after it was over. Livy and I had started up a serious relationship for quite some time. They get your number and phone up, pretending to be BT, then ask, 'Are you and your leading lady in love?' You let them write about it, and all this invented stuff comes out. It's astounding, breathtaking, what gets invented.\"</p> <p>Firth gets panicky about the paraphernalia of stardom: he may be a contemporary of Hugh Grant and Ralph Fiennes, groomed to be the foppish love interest, but his ambivalence shows. Too reticent, too twitchy. And perhaps we love him all the more for it.</p> <p>Given all this, his latest career move seems decidedly odd. Firth is Mr Darcy again, except this time he's a big, celluloid, tear-jerking Mr Darcy; a larger-than-life Darcy, shunted forward with all the might of Universal Pictures and Miramax. He plays an ironic spoof of himself as the brooding romantic lead, Mark Darcy, in Bridget Jones's Diary, tipped to be one of the biggest films of the year. This is Darcy with bells on. </p> <p>The film, which opens in Britain and the US in two weeks, has all the shameless, blockbuster-manufacturing of Notting Hill and Four Weddings And A Funeral, and is based on Helen Fielding's bestselling novel about the loneliness, anxiety and aspirations of the urban, single thirtysomething female. Richard Curtis and Fielding have come up with a galloping script. Hugh Grant gets top billing as the rakish seducer Daniel Cleaver, despite playing a secondary character to Firth's (he's a bigger star, so has to be on the poster). There's even the requisite US lead, Renee Zellweger, as Bridget herself (brace yourself for some rictus English vowels, somewhere between Dick van Dyke and Camilla Parker Bowles).</p> <p>But there are a few imaginative twists, too, in the big-screen debut of director Sharon Maguire, a documentary-maker who is close to Fielding and was one of the models for Bridget's friend, Shazzer. In one scene, a soir\u00e9e held by the publishers where Bridget works, there are cameos by Salman Rushdie, Sebastian Faulks, Alain de Botton and Jeffrey Archer, all as themselves.</p> <p>And, in the midst of it all, is Firth, our national treasure, as faithful to his character in the book as it is possible to be, in part because Firth is Mark Darcy. It is the book that is faithful to him: Fielding was as captivated with Pride And Prejudice as everyone else, and was instrumental, via her Bridget Jones newspaper column, in establishing Firth in female folklore. She created the character Mark Darcy to become Bridget's paramour: a brooding, diffident human rights lawyer who stands silently beside bookshelves a lot and has trouble expressing himself. The novel, which sold 4 million copies worldwide (1.5 million of them in the UK), was a loose reworking of Pride And Prejudice in much the same way that the film Clueless reworked Emma.</p> <p>Bridget is a spirited, more accident-prone Elizabeth Bennet. Her mother, a shrill and tactless suburban housewife, is as mortifyingly vulgar as Austen's Mrs Bennet. There is no eloping Lydia; instead, Bridget herself falls prey to her flirtatious boss, Daniel Cleaver (aka, George Wickham). She is naive, and believes Cleaver's smears against Mark Darcy, wrongly turning against him just as he is warming to her. Darcy appears in turn awkward, supercilious, arrogant but eventually kind and, ultimately, Bridget's rescuer.</p> <p>The casting directors must have needed only one number when casting Darcy. Early in the book, Bridget makes her first observations about him at a Christmas turkey curry buffet held by mutual friends: \"The rich, divorced-by-cruel-wife Mark - quite tall - was standing with his back to the room, scrutinising the contents of the Alconburys' bookshelves: mainly leather-bound series of books about the Third Reich . . . It struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party. It's like being called Heathcliff and insisting on spending the entire evening in the garden, shouting 'Cathy' and banging your head against a tree.\" It's pure Firth. At least, it's pure Firth-as-Mr-Darcy. The man standing by the bookshelves definitely has curly hair, dark eyes, a slightly down-turned mouth and a look of childish vulnerability on his face. And he definitely takes himself too seriously.</p> <p>We meet for the first time in a private drawing room at a London hotel, all leather armchairs, halogen downlighters and bowls of lilies. We sit at either end of a vast white sofa, in front of a fake log fire, engulfed in tension. I ask how he feels about the film, about the hoohah that is about to burst all around him. \"I'm not confident about the film,\" he says bluntly. \"I've no reason to be confident about the film. We all did our best.\"</p> <p>Did he enjoy making it? \"Yee-es.\" That's a no then. \"I found it intriguing that this thing seemed to be reflecting back on itself. I was aware of it when making the decision and thinking, 'Is this going to make things worse?' If the film's a success, then I'll be back in it again - and, yes, I've thought about that. If it makes me more of a household name than Darcy did, then I don't know how I'll deal with it. But it might just go away.\"</p> <p>Go away? He's already \"back in it\". Earlier, when he walked into the foyer, he looked sheepish, embarrassed by the small circus whipping up around him. He had come from a photo-shoot at a women's magazine where he had to be \"styled\". When posing, he was asked to look \"more gangster\", but didn't know how, so they suggested he look at his cuffs. \"I don't mind it,\" he mutters, \"but I feel a bit silly.\"</p> <p>Firth has talked often about looking ordinary, about having a malleable face that is easily transformed by make-up and expression. He is one of those celebrities you have to stare at good and hard to be sure it's him. I can't remember exactly what Firth was wearing on that first meeting: something dark and jeansy, in a sort of sixth-form teacher way. </p> <p>Remember, he may have smouldered as Darcy, but he was suitably lumpen as the woman-averse fan in Fever Pitch and innocently plump in The English Patient. (Though many asked who on earth would leave him for Ralph Fiennes?) His opening gag in Bridget Jones centres on exactly this cuddly-uncle-versus-sex-symbol split. Darcy stands alone beside some French windows at the buffet. The camera pans down to show him wearing an absurd reindeer sweater of the Christmas present variety.</p> <p>Cut to our second meeting, a week later at his local watering hole, the Almeida Theatre bar, in Islington, and it's a different story. He wears a leather jacket, he seems slim and tousled. He laughs a lot; his cheeks dimple. We talk about ordinary things: giving up smoking, when to have children, favourite books. He is warm and open and, frankly, to die for. It strikes me that this was part of the strength of the original Darcy, and other parts Firth has done well: he emits a slow-burning magnetism that reveals itself in stages. </p> <p>Not a Brad Pitt rush-to-the-head, rather a repressed, diffident warm-up. This may be as much of an acting achievement as anything else, no less powerful because it comes naturally to him. When I suggest that Darcy was a triumph in this sense, he takes umbrage: \"Whatever achievement was there, I prefer to think of it as an acting one.\" It seems he is forever fending off accusations of sexiness.</p> <p>There must be something about being a pin-up that jars with Firth's schoolish upbringing. His parents, retired teachers, are staunchly leftwing, well-travelled and concerned about the social issues of the day. His mother completed her PhD six years ago and has long fought for the rights of asylum seekers imprisoned in the UK. His brother, six years younger, is also an actor, and his sister, two years younger, is a speech trainer: \"We're not close-knit: months can go by without hearing from each other, but there aren't any feuds.\"</p> <p>Firth was born in Nigeria, where his parents were teaching. Some have commented on his faintly colonial speech, but I find him accentless. Every now and then, a strange, wide vowel crops up, but it could as easily be American as Winchester, where the family later settled. His memories of Africa are scant, but in them he seems a rather vulnerable child: \"I can remember very clearly my father driving to work in a Beetle. There was a dirt road that went perpendicular to the house and I would watch him go. I could still see him when he parked the car outside the school - it wasn't far, but an unpleasant walk in the African sun. He was a little dot. And I remember thinking: 'What's he got better to do there than hanging around with me?' \"</p> <p>There are other sensory memories, of the house or a toy, \"and an African boy who I spent a lot of time with, called Godfrey, and him trying to persuade me to come round to his place, and me being scared to go\". It's a vulnerability often visible on the adult Firth's face - a sort of troubled, slightly teary look, that makes him look nowhere near 40. After Africa, there was a long spell in England, where fitting in at school was a problem. Like many middle-class parents, the Firths had an aversion to television's vulgar newcomer, ITV, and the children were not allowed to watch it. They found it difficult, as a result, to join in some of the playground banter. </p> <p>As an adolescent, Firth and his family spent a year in St Louis, where his parents were on a teaching exchange. Fitting in at a US school was even worse: Firth described himself as the English geek among throngs of earring-wearing, long-haired rockers. At least, so the mythology goes.</p> <p>\"I find myself volunteering a lament for my school days, and I've never done that,\" he says. \"It starts to look as if Colin Firth wants to talk about his school days, and it's just bullshit. You know, we all have our memories and our own version of history which helps us explain ourselves, but we don't all get asked about it. It does put you in a strange relationship with it, because a sort of mythology that you've created about yourself to yourself grows up, and it's compounded by having it put in print. I didn't like school - I don't really want to weave yet another quote about that.\"</p> <p>It's hard to imagine Firth on a movie junket, where stars are installed in a suite and journalists queue to question them for a maximum of around seven minutes, timed by a PR with a stopwatch. He is singularly unable to sugar himself with frothy chatter and would be far happier sitting in an armchair, harrumphing over the papers. \"If I could distinguish myself at those parties and chat shows, it might be easier,\" he once lamented. </p> <p>Soon after Pride And Prejudice, he was called by Spielberg's \"people\", and had a meeting in Hollywood with the man himself. \"It was weird to find that someone who is such an enormous figure in the business was so chatty and informal and unassuming. He had his feet up, and was wearing a baseball cap and sipping a McDonald's Coke.\" I imagine Firth didn't do a very hard sell. \"He didn't invite me to do his films.\"</p> <p>Firth has no particular allegiance to low-budget British films - he would love to do a Hollywood blockbuster, he says, but good scripts are thin on the ground. The problem with today's films lies not in production, but in the writing. Couple that with his natural uncertainty (he turned down Pride And Prejudice several times), and the halting aspect to his career starts to make sense. He has described himself as a \"passive resister\", and agrees there is something particular in him that makes him retreat. \"I think it's a survival instinct, putting the brakes on, not wanting things to get out of control. There's an adage about the fear of success being as great as the fear of failure. I think most people have that, and I don't think it's entirely self-destructive or unhealthy. It may be that you really can get into dangerous territory - the normal things in my life are very important to me.</p> <p>\"It's not just that the threat of egomania and narcissism are always looming [though I suspect they always are], it's just that the things I value happen to be much more to do with the things that everyone else values: friends and family and having a life. I like the real world, I like going to the supermarket. I don't want to drift so far from that that I have a life of bodyguards and a house on Mulholland Drive.</p> <p>\"I'm scared of setting myself up in frightening projects, but I don't think I'm controlled by that fear. I usually take it on. I think it's more to do with the profile and the trappings than the fear of extending myself.\"</p> <p>He took retreating to an extreme in the late 80s, when he disappeared into the wilds of Canada. In 1988, while making Valmont, a totally ignored version of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, he fell in love with another co-star, Meg Tilly. They had a son, Will, now 10, and lived a reclusive life in British Columbia, where he did nothing but change nappies for a couple of years. There were times when it snowed so hard, they couldn't even go out for a walk. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't recommend it as a career move.\" The relationship with Tilly petered out in 1993, but they remain on good terms. \"My son is triple national,\" he says proudly. \"My son is born Canadian, took American citizenship quite recently, but he's also English. Because of the complications of my life, any free time goes to him. I fly to see him [in California] whenever I have a moment. That's the only place where I really hang out.\"</p> <p>After Pride And Prejudice, he met Livia, a producer's assistant, on the set of Nostromo in another remote setting, South America. She had no idea who he was. \"I remember saying to Livia and her family in Italy, 'You know, I'm a heart-throb.' And they all threw their hands up and said, 'Get outta here.' Someone sent some tapes of the series to Italy and they didn't get it. They don't find reserved very sexy. They watched it and said, 'So, do people in England find John Major sexy?' \" </p> <p>Livia lived in Rome throughout their courtship, but still suffered the indignity of having her family telephoned by the Express. \"People might think it a bit precious to be bothered,\" he says earnestly. \"The real problem was they were trying to find out where my wedding was going to be, and that was the bottom line. It was in the Italian countryside and they would have spoiled it. Having people trying to trick you into telling them where it's going to be - it makes you very protective.\"</p> <p>So Firth is finally over his wanderlust: he has married, sold his Hackney flat, upgraded to Islington, joined Amnesty and begun campaigning for the rights of asylum seekers. He talks books with Nick Hornby, eschews the company of actors, and now and then plays piano and guitar. And he hopes to carry on this anonymous existence, despite appearing in cinemas nationwide. \"The attention might not focus on me. I mean, there are two actors in it who are far more famous than I am, they'll soak up most of it.\" He may be right. Bridget Jones might prove more of a showcase for Grant, who for once has been cast in a role with some bite. \"He's very witty company,\" says Firth. \"I've always found him bright, and he's a fantastic raconteur: he's wicked. He's not like his Notting Hill persona at all.\"</p> <p>And Firth's decision to do so high-profile a film may have as much to do with pragmatism as with a readiness to step into the mainstream for a spell. He is providing for his new baby at a time when impending strike action by the Screen Actors Guild, of which he is a member, threatens his earning power over the next year. In the immediate future, however, Firth is back in dress shirts, in Oliver Parker's The Importance Of Being Earnest, in which he plays Jack. Beyond that, projects will have to be child-friendly: \"I'll be a dad who goes to work. I do intend to be a dad. If I do do something in the summer, it'll have to be something where I can have my kids around me.\"</p> <p>The baby may well have another effect on the anxious, brooding, Darcyish side of Firth's character. His concerns about success, being populist, selling out or losing his privacy may seem less tumultuous: \"All that stuff pales into insignificance next to the things you really care about in your life.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/gallery/0,8454,465964,00.html\">Colin Firth picture gallery</a>: a selection of his film and TV work</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,468499,00.html\">Bridget Jones links</a></p> <p>\u0095 Bridget Jones's Diary is released on April 13.</p>",

But there are a few imaginative twists, too, in the big-screen debut of director Sharon Maguire, a documentary-maker who is close to Fielding and was one of the models for Bridget's friend, Shazzer. In one scene, a soir\u00e9e held by the publishers where Bridget works, there are cameos by Salman Rushdie, Sebastian Faulks, Alain de Botton and Jeffrey Archer, all as themselves. And, in the midst of it all, is Firth, our national treasure, as faithful to his character in the book as it is possible to be, in part because Firth is Mark Darcy. It is the book that is faithful to him: Fielding was as captivated with Pride And Prejudice as everyone else, and was instrumental, via her Bridget Jones newspaper column, in establishing Firth in female folklore. She created the character Mark Darcy to become Bridget's paramour: a brooding, diffident human rights lawyer who stands silently beside bookshelves a lot and has trouble expressing himself. The novel, which sold 4 million copies worldwide (1.5 million of them in the UK), was a loose reworking of Pride And Prejudice in much the same way that the film Clueless reworked Emma. Bridget is a spirited, more accident-prone Elizabeth Bennet. Her mother, a shrill and tactless suburban housewife, is as mortifyingly vulgar as Austen's Mrs Bennet. There is no eloping Lydia; instead, Bridget herself falls prey to her flirtatious boss, Daniel Cleaver (aka, George Wickham). She is naive, and believes Cleaver's smears against Mark Darcy, wrongly turning against him just as he is warming to her. Darcy appears in turn awkward, supercilious, arrogant but eventually kind and, ultimately, Bridget's rescuer. The casting directors must have needed only one number when casting Darcy. Early in the book, Bridget makes her first observations about him at a Christmas turkey curry buffet held by mutual friends: \"The rich, divorced-by-cruel-wife Mark - quite tall - was standing with his back to the room, scrutinising the contents of the Alconburys' bookshelves: mainly leather-bound series of books about the Third Reich . . . It struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party. It's like being called Heathcliff and insisting on spending the entire evening in the garden, shouting 'Cathy' and banging your head against a tree.\" It's pure Firth. At least, it's pure Firth-as-Mr-Darcy. The man standing by the bookshelves definitely has curly hair, dark eyes, a slightly down-turned mouth and a look of childish vulnerability on his face. And he definitely takes himself too seriously. We meet for the first time in a private drawing room at a London hotel, all leather armchairs, halogen downlighters and bowls of lilies. We sit at either end of a vast white sofa, in front of a fake log fire, engulfed in tension. I ask how he feels about the film, about the hoohah that is about to burst all around him. \"I'm not confident about the film,\" he says bluntly. \"I've no reason to be confident about the film. We all did our best.\" Did he enjoy making it? \"Yee-es.\" That's a no then. \"I found it intriguing that this thing seemed to be reflecting back on itself. I was aware of it when making the decision and thinking, 'Is this going to make things worse?' If the film's a success, then I'll be back in it again - and, yes, I've thought about that. If it makes me more of a household name than Darcy did, then I don't know how I'll deal with it. But it might just go away.\" Go away? He's already \"back in it\". Earlier, when he walked into the foyer, he looked sheepish, embarrassed by the small circus whipping up around him. He had come from a photo-shoot at a women's magazine where he had to be \"styled\". When posing, he was asked to look \"more gangster\", but didn't know how, so they suggested he look at his cuffs. \"I don't mind it,\" he mutters, \"but I feel a bit silly.\" Firth has talked often about looking ordinary, about having a malleable face that is easily transformed by make-up and expression. He is one of those celebrities you have to stare at good and hard to be sure it's him. I can't remember exactly what Firth was wearing on that first meeting: something dark and jeansy, in a sort of sixth-form teacher way. Remember, he may have smouldered as Darcy, but he was suitably lumpen as the woman-averse fan in Fever Pitch and innocently plump in The English Patient. (Though many asked who on earth would leave him for Ralph Fiennes?) His opening gag in Bridget Jones centres on exactly this cuddly-uncle-versus-sex-symbol split. Darcy stands alone beside some French windows at the buffet. The camera pans down to show him wearing an absurd reindeer sweater of the Christmas present variety. Cut to our second meeting, a week later at his local watering hole, the Almeida Theatre bar, in Islington, and it's a different story. He wears a leather jacket, he seems slim and tousled. He laughs a lot; his cheeks dimple. We talk about ordinary things: giving up smoking, when to have children, favourite books. He is warm and open and, frankly, to die for. It strikes me that this was part of the strength of the original Darcy, and other parts Firth has done well: he emits a slow-burning magnetism that reveals itself in stages. Not a Brad Pitt rush-to-the-head, rather a repressed, diffident warm-up. This may be as much of an acting achievement as anything else, no less powerful because it comes naturally to him. When I suggest that Darcy was a triumph in this sense, he takes umbrage: \"Whatever achievement was there, I prefer to think of it as an acting one.\" It seems he is forever fending off accusations of sexiness. There must be something about being a pin-up that jars with Firth's schoolish upbringing. His parents, retired teachers, are staunchly leftwing, well-travelled and concerned about the social issues of the day. His mother completed her PhD six years ago and has long fought for the rights of asylum seekers imprisoned in the UK. His brother, six years younger, is also an actor, and his sister, two years younger, is a speech trainer: \"We're not close-knit: months can go by without hearing from each other, but there aren't any feuds.\" Firth was born in Nigeria, where his parents were teaching. Some have commented on his faintly colonial speech, but I find him accentless. Every now and then, a strange, wide vowel crops up, but it could as easily be American as Winchester, where the family later settled. His memories of Africa are scant, but in them he seems a rather vulnerable child: \"I can remember very clearly my father driving to work in a Beetle. There was a dirt road that went perpendicular to the house and I would watch him go. I could still see him when he parked the car outside the school - it wasn't far, but an unpleasant walk in the African sun. He was a little dot. And I remember thinking: 'What's he got better to do there than hanging around with me?' \" There are other sensory memories, of the house or a toy, \"and an African boy who I spent a lot of time with, called Godfrey, and him trying to persuade me to come round to his place, and me being scared to go\". It's a vulnerability often visible on the adult Firth's face - a sort of troubled, slightly teary look, that makes him look nowhere near 40. After Africa, there was a long spell in England, where fitting in at school was a problem. Like many middle-class parents, the Firths had an aversion to television's vulgar newcomer, ITV, and the children were not allowed to watch it. They found it difficult, as a result, to join in some of the playground banter. As an adolescent, Firth and his family spent a year in St Louis, where his parents were on a teaching exchange. Fitting in at a US school was even worse: Firth described himself as the English geek among throngs of earring-wearing, long-haired rockers. At least, so the mythology goes. \"I find myself volunteering a lament for my school days, and I've never done that,\" he says. \"It starts to look as if Colin Firth wants to talk about his school days, and it's just bullshit. You know, we all have our memories and our own version of history which helps us explain ourselves, but we don't all get asked about it. It does put you in a strange relationship with it, because a sort of mythology that you've created about yourself to yourself grows up, and it's compounded by having it put in print. I didn't like school - I don't really want to weave yet another quote about that.\" It's hard to imagine Firth on a movie junket, where stars are installed in a suite and journalists queue to question them for a maximum of around seven minutes, timed by a PR with a stopwatch. He is singularly unable to sugar himself with frothy chatter and would be far happier sitting in an armchair, harrumphing over the papers. \"If I could distinguish myself at those parties and chat shows, it might be easier,\" he once lamented. Soon after Pride And Prejudice, he was called by Spielberg's \"people\", and had a meeting in Hollywood with the man himself. \"It was weird to find that someone who is such an enormous figure in the business was so chatty and informal and unassuming. He had his feet up, and was wearing a baseball cap and sipping a McDonald's Coke.\" I imagine Firth didn't do a very hard sell. \"He didn't invite me to do his films.\" Firth has no particular allegiance to low-budget British films - he would love to do a Hollywood blockbuster, he says, but good scripts are thin on the ground. The problem with today's films lies not in production, but in the writing. Couple that with his natural uncertainty (he turned down Pride And Prejudice several times), and the halting aspect to his career starts to make sense. He has described himself as a \"passive resister\", and agrees there is something particular in him that makes him retreat. \"I think it's a survival instinct, putting the brakes on, not wanting things to get out of control. There's an adage about the fear of success being as great as the fear of failure. I think most people have that, and I don't think it's entirely self-destructive or unhealthy. It may be that you really can get into dangerous territory - the normal things in my life are very important to me. \"It's not just that the threat of egomania and narcissism are always looming [though I suspect they always are], it's just that the things I value happen to be much more to do with the things that everyone else values: friends and family and having a life. I like the real world, I like going to the supermarket. I don't want to drift so far from that that I have a life of bodyguards and a house on Mulholland Drive. \"I'm scared of setting myself up in frightening projects, but I don't think I'm controlled by that fear. I usually take it on. I think it's more to do with the profile and the trappings than the fear of extending myself.\" He took retreating to an extreme in the late 80s, when he disappeared into the wilds of Canada. In 1988, while making Valmont, a totally ignored version of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, he fell in love with another co-star, Meg Tilly. They had a son, Will, now 10, and lived a reclusive life in British Columbia, where he did nothing but change nappies for a couple of years. There were times when it snowed so hard, they couldn't even go out for a walk. \"I wouldn't recommend it as a career move.\" The relationship with Tilly petered out in 1993, but they remain on good terms. \"My son is triple national,\" he says proudly. \"My son is born Canadian, took American citizenship quite recently, but he's also English. Because of the complications of my life, any free time goes to him. I fly to see him [in California] whenever I have a moment. That's the only place where I really hang out.\" After Pride And Prejudice, he met Livia, a producer's assistant, on the set of Nostromo in another remote setting, South America. She had no idea who he was. \"I remember saying to Livia and her family in Italy, 'You know, I'm a heart-throb.' And they all threw their hands up and said, 'Get outta here.' Someone sent some tapes of the series to Italy and they didn't get it. They don't find reserved very sexy. They watched it and said, 'So, do people in England find John Major sexy?' \" Livia lived in Rome throughout their courtship, but still suffered the indignity of having her family telephoned by the Express. \"People might think it a bit precious to be bothered,\" he says earnestly. \"The real problem was they were trying to find out where my wedding was going to be, and that was the bottom line. It was in the Italian countryside and they would have spoiled it. Having people trying to trick you into telling them where it's going to be - it makes you very protective.\" So Firth is finally over his wanderlust: he has married, sold his Hackney flat, upgraded to Islington, joined Amnesty and begun campaigning for the rights of asylum seekers. He talks books with Nick Hornby, eschews the company of actors, and now and then plays piano and guitar. And he hopes to carry on this anonymous existence, despite appearing in cinemas nationwide. \"The attention might not focus on me. I mean, there are two actors in it who are far more famous than I am, they'll soak up most of it.\" He may be right. Bridget Jones might prove more of a showcase for Grant, who for once has been cast in a role with some bite. \"He's very witty company,\" says Firth. \"I've always found him bright, and he's a fantastic raconteur: he's wicked. He's not like his Notting Hill persona at all.\" And Firth's decision to do so high-profile a film may have as much to do with pragmatism as with a readiness to step into the mainstream for a spell. He is providing for his new baby at a time when impending strike action by the Screen Actors Guild, of which he is a member, threatens his earning power over the next year. In the immediate future, however, Firth is back in dress shirts, in Oliver Parker's The Importance Of Being Earnest, in which he plays Jack. Beyond that, projects will have to be child-friendly: \"I'll be a dad who goes to work. I do intend to be a dad. If I do do something in the summer, it'll have to be something where I can have my kids around me.\" The baby may well have another effect on the anxious, brooding, Darcyish side of Firth's character. His concerns about success, being populist, selling out or losing his privacy may seem less tumultuous: \"All that stuff pales into insignificance next to the things you really care about in your life.\" Colin Firth picture gallery: a selection of his film and TV work Bridget Jones links \u0095 Bridget Jones's Diary is released on April 13.",

There was also a mother who thrashed her small son endlessly and alcoholic printers who brewed and drank their own moonshine. This was a writer with a magical side and spiritual depth, both on dazzling show in the novels The Master and Margarita and The Heart of a Dog, and in Diaboliad, a collection of 20s magazine journalism; but they were underpinned by the realism nurtured through these grim experiences.

The talent was flowering wonderfully when the Great Purges began and Bulgakov was silenced, although never imprisoned. In desperation, he famously wrote to the Soviet government in 1930, saying that \"not being able to write is like being buried alive\".

Like everything in Russia, Gudok is changing. Under new management, it plans to live up to its cheerful name (Gudok means \"the Hooter\") and more particularly to its most famous former employee. Everyone at the newspaper's offices is conscious that this chair and that hatstand over there were used by Mikhail Afanasievich Bulgakov. Suppressed for most of the Soviet period, Bulgakov is now a Russian icon, a precise cliche because he is developing the trappings of a saint. His surreal masterpiece, The Master and Margarita, is the country's bestselling book and has created scores of dependent industries. You can play the weekly M&amp;M quiz and treasure hunt on Moscow Echo radio, have your hair cut at the Master and Margarita hairdressers, and visit the book's Haunted Flat, which is now a funky tourist attraction. In Britain, by contrast, Bulgakov has had a modest cult following since the first sensational appearance of his previously banned work in the Soviet Union in 1967, and its subsequent UK publication in 1969. Things is changing quickly. This spring, his name must be a hot contender for the title of word most frequently uttered on BBC Radio 4 - up there with Rockall, Forties and North Utsire. There is nothing so organised as a BBC Bulgakov season, which would be most un-Bulgakovian; out of keeping with a man whose novels, plays, and many short stories were banned but whose best-known play was Stalin's personal favourite; whose masterpiece was only, finally, published because the ex-military man in charge of a Soviet literary magazine either didn't read it, or didn't understand it.

The former Yugoslav president, aided by groups of loyalists and some army elements, stubbornly refused \"to be taken alive\" as police surrounding his home came under fire during attempts to bring him to justice. Saying that Milosevic was being guarded by \u0093drunken mercenaries\u0094, Serbian interior minister Dusan Mihajlovic pledged Milosevic would be detained, using force if necessary. \"We will execute our task,\" said Mihajlovic. \"Milosevic will either have to turn himself in to the investigating judge or we will detain him by force or peacefully.\" He would remain \"under house arrest until he is brought to justice.\" But Mihajlovic warned that the police were being \"prevented\" from executing the arrest because of the presence of heavily-armed men in Milosevic's residence, and added that elite units from the Yugoslav army were obstructing the operation. \"The army effectively took orders from unauthorized personnel in the service of Milosevic,\" he said. Milosevic's villa in the quiet suburb has been the scene of confusion since darkness fell over the city on Friday, when police moved in to arrest Milosevic only to face resistance from his supporters. The move came ahead of a Saturday midnight deadline from Washington to the new Belgrade authorities to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in order to win massive aid for the country. By lunchtime on Saturday 200 supporters shouting \"Slobo, Slobo, We will not give you away!\" broke through two police cordons to reach the main gate of his residence in the upmarket suburb of Dedinje. When police tried to disperse them, the protestors began a sit-in, and a vehicle carrying special police to the area turned back rather than face the demonstrators. Foreign secretary Robin Cook claimed that it was the beginning of the end for the Serbian leader. \"Whatever the actual hour-by-hour blow is in relation to events in Belgrade, this is plainly the end game for Milosevic.

For here is the grilled goats' cheese, with artichokes, peppers and pesto this time, and roasted cod, the sea bass de nos jours (and so much nicer), with a sage and onion crust, and cured salmon with scallop ceviche, avocado and fennel - all smart variations on the canon of contemporary cooking. In short, there is something at La Trompette for everyone, not just the offal pariah.</p> <p> But then, this should come as no surprise, because the muscle behind the restaurant is made up of Nigel Platts-Martin, quondam partner of Marco Pierre White in the halcyon days of Harvey's, and presently prop of The Square; and Bruce Poole of Chez Bruce, which, as the world knows, used to be Harvey's in the halcyon days of MPW; and they are both the brains behind the Glasshouse in Kew, a well-loved model of a modern brasserie in the form of a neighbourhood restaurant.</p> <p>La Trompette is more along the lines of the Glasshouse, but is rather more senior. For the historians among you, it stands on the site of the long-serving and rather gloomy La Dordogne. Maybe the area induces inspiration of the crepuscular kind among restaurant designers, because La Trompette is not done up with the vulgar techni-colour of an African sunset, nor with the chill minimalism of the ever fashionable 51 shades of white. Mushroom and beige are La Trompette's favoured colours, cunningly textured to soften the rather squared-up lines of the place. Actually, it comes across as a smooth, sophisticated, Paris-suburb kind of place, an impression reinforced by the easy dispatch of the service. Given the fact that the place was only about four days old on the evening that Pic St Loup and I ate there, it ran with impressive smoothness. But then Nigel P-M and Bruce P are known to be sticklers for getting things right.</p> <p> Sadly, I can't see the crisp pigs' ears lasting the course, or the daube and cassoulet, for that matter, but there is much else on the menu that exhibits an acute, not to say cute, sybaritic intelligence. The food isn't ground-breaking stuff, or even ground-shaking stuff. It's middle-ground stuff, with its roots firmly in the French regions and in a sense of pleasure. We didn't have the smoked haddock brandade with poached egg and hollandaise sauce, for example, or the thinly sliced rump of veal with green beans, meat juices and pecorino, or the deep-fried sole with tartare sauce, or the rump of lamb with couscous, merguez, hoummos and coriander, although, personally, I could have downed the lot.</p> <p> I did, as perhaps you've guessed, dally with the pigs' ear and sweetbread combo, followed by roast guinea fowl with braised lettuce and potato galette, and rounded the proceedings off with chocolate profiteroles, which took me back, oooh, a decade or two. Pic St Loup was taken with the fish, starting with cured salmon with scallop ceviche, avo and fennel, before moving on to fillet of halibut with shellfish and saffron risotto, and then cantering past the finishing post with a crisp apple tart and caramel ice cream.</p> <p> What was curious, given the robust impression given by the menu, was how restrained the dishes tasted. Pigs' ears have a delicious porcine delicacy about them that cohabits comfortably with the self-effacing quality of sweetbreads, so much so that the real delight of this dish lies in its subtlety of flavour and contrasting textures. But let's not get carried away, because the good manners exhibited here paid fewer dividends on other dishes. P St L's cured salmon was decent enough, but where was the sea-green sweetness of the really fresh scallop needed to make the ceviche sing? Pleasant enough though it was, the dish lacked focus of any kind. The same was true of my guinea fowl, which should have been a star dish. I love braised lettuce almost as much as I like pigs' ears, but while I scoffed all in front of me without any difficulty - helped along by an absolute stonking Italian red, Massetto Nero - I can't actually remember much about it. In fact, I remember thinking at the time, I can't actually remember much about this.</p> <p> The fillet of halibut with shellfish and saffron risotto, on the other hand, showed the kitchen right back on course - splendid fish, crisp on top and fleshy beneath, risotto the colour of marigolds and reeking of marine life: it was just a humdinger of a dish. And the puds, too, are beautifully made and each one from my list of 50 all-time favourites. By and large, then, there's some tip-top cooking going on at La Trompette.</p> <p> I have a small confession to make. We did get rather seriously stuck into the wine list. It's an easy and delightful pitfall into which to dive, partly because of the charm of the sommeli?re, and partly because there are many fine and unusual wines listed: among them, riesling from the peerless Laurence Faller by the glass, rogue Sancerres from Cotat, the epic Massetto Nero from Friuli, and a whole brigade of superior sherries. These wines don't come cheap, but nor are they expensive by restaurant standards. Anyway, the long and the short of it is that the bill came to \u00a3126.85, which is quite a lot, particularly when you consider that the food element was only \u00a350.

In June 1999, there were 8,150 people in jail for drug offences, an increase of 3% on the previous year. </p> <p>Home office minister Charles Clarke claimed that the statistics showed that enforcement was working in line with the government's drug strategy.</p>",

Many of these former industrial sites are being converted into trendy apartments so residents should take extra care before embarking on DIY. </p> <p>But it is not just homeowners that are at risk from as bestos, staff carrying out the conversions are frequently exposed to hazardous materials.

The aim is to make information that can save lives easily available, says Owen Tudor, the TUC's senior health and safety policy officer. </p> <p>By logging on to the site, property developers, surveyors, planners and builders will be able to see whether there is an asbestos register for the building on which they are about to start work, he says.

Peter Heron, of Peter Horne Estate Agents in Sunderland, says: \"The housing market in Sunderland continues to show a high level of demand across the board.\" A similar picture emerges in the West Midlands, with the demand for property running at its highest levels since 1988, according to Paul Keates in Cheadle, Staffordshire. </p> <p>But despite the improvement in activity in the north, the market for industrial terraced houses remains lifeless. Mark Hunter of Grice &amp; Hunter in Doncaster says: \"There's still a problem with industrial housing. There's a lot of poor quality terraces on the market, which tend to be sold to speculators in the buy-to-let market for around \u00a310-15,000, and they can often only get rents of around \u00a360 per month for them. In some ways they are returning to what they began as - low cost rented properties.\" </p> <p>Mr Waddingham agrees: \"In the poorer areas, particularly with regard to older terraced housing, demand is minimal.\" </p> <p>In Doncaster, the prices of semi-detached houses are up, but are only 10% above where they were a decade ago, and sell for between \u00a350-60,000 says Mr Hunter. </p> <p>The valuers blame low wages and part-time working. \"The traditional industries of coalmining, railways and heavy manufacturing have collapsed around here. Some of the jobs have been replaced by distribution - but what you get is a huge warehouse with about three people working in it. Other new jobs are often part time or low paid. The problem is not the lack of jobs but the lack of money.\" </p> <p>But outside of poorer areas, the property market has been buoyant. \"There are good areas around here - such as Sprotbrugh, Tickhill and Epworth - where properties sell almost regardless of price.\" Typical prices in these areas have jumped from around \u00a3160,000 two years ago to \u00a3200,000 today. </p> <p>But Mr Hunter adds that the market fades out at properties above \u00a3200,000. \"The number of instructions we receive above \u00a3200,000 is still low. For example, in West Butterwick there's a late Victorian mansion with a four-bed modern detached bungalow in its grounds which has been put on the market for \u00a3295,000.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>More than a million adults who are suffering from a crippling disorder which can lead to criminal behaviour are being overlooked because doctors believe the condition is confined to childhood, it was claimed yesterday. </p> <p>A leading forensic psychologist, Susan Young, told the British Psychological Society's annual conference in Glasgow yesterday that as much as 3% of the adult population could have attention defecit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). </p> <p>These people, however, are not receiving essential treatment and medication because many psychiatrists and psychologists believe children grow out of the disorder. </p> <p>Dr Young, of the Institute of Psychiatry, said some studies estimate the condition - which is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness - may affect up to 25% of the prison population. </p> <p>Little work has been done on the prevalence of ADHD in adulthood, but Dr Young said that 6% of children have the disorder and around half of them will carry it through to adulthood. \"I think what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. We cannot possibly have identified all the adults in the population with ADHD.\" </p> <p>ADHD in adults can be treated successfully with the controversial drug Ritalin - which has been heavily criticised over its effect on children - but adult patients can often become depressed and need additional psychological help. </p> <p>Dr Young studied 30 adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD later in life and compared their progress with a group of 30 adults who had other personality problems, but not ADHD, and a group of 30 \"normal\" adults. </p> <p>All of the people involved in the survey were from middle class backgrounds and were of average intelligence.

      "bodyText": "More than a million adults who are suffering from a crippling disorder which can lead to criminal behaviour are being overlooked because doctors believe the condition is confined to childhood, it was claimed yesterday. A leading forensic psychologist, Susan Young, told the British Psychological Society's annual conference in Glasgow yesterday that as much as 3% of the adult population could have attention defecit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These people, however, are not receiving essential treatment and medication because many psychiatrists and psychologists believe children grow out of the disorder. Dr Young, of the Institute of Psychiatry, said some studies estimate the condition - which is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness - may affect up to 25% of the prison population. Little work has been done on the prevalence of ADHD in adulthood, but Dr Young said that 6% of children have the disorder and around half of them will carry it through to adulthood. \"I think what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. We cannot possibly have identified all the adults in the population with ADHD.\" ADHD in adults can be treated successfully with the controversial drug Ritalin - which has been heavily criticised over its effect on children - but adult patients can often become depressed and need additional psychological help. Dr Young studied 30 adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD later in life and compared their progress with a group of 30 adults who had other personality problems, but not ADHD, and a group of 30 \"normal\" adults. All of the people involved in the survey were from middle class backgrounds and were of average intelligence. But Dr Young found \"huge differences\" in their lifestyles. Around one third of ADHD sufferers had attended special schools for children with learning difficulties against only 7% of those with other personality disorders. No one from the \"normal\" group had gone to a special school. People with ADHD also found it much more difficult to hold down jobs and two thirds were unemployed, compared to only 3% of the \"normal\" group. They also had severe social problems and had difficulty forming friendships. Dr Young also found that 25% of people with ADHD had been to prison. \"They were stealing, fire-setting, being cruel to animals - all the way up to homicide,\" she added. Dr Young set up the first clinic for adults with ADHD at Maudsley hospital, south London, in 1994. There is only one other specialist clinic in the UK. \u0095 Simple relaxation and hypnotherapy techniques could extend the lives of lymphatic cancer patients by up to 32 months, according to new research by a team of psychologists led by Leslie Walker, of Hull University. The psychological therapies were administered to help the patients deal with nausea, vomiting and other side effects inherent in chemotherapy.

      "body": "<p>The three slaughtermen are young, cheerful and clear-eyed. Killing is their business and they have never known trade like this. In the spring morning light they were on a farm near Wigton, Cumbria, shooting more than 100 cows and 500 sheep. Now the Ministry of Agriculture has told them to go to Jim Hutcheson's Scale End farm near Penrith. </p> <p>Our mobile death squad rattles through the lowlands south of Carlisle. We carry, in the back of a 16-year-old white van, cartridges, stun guns, decontamination suits, blue overalls, rubber gloves, sprays, wellington boots, forms and all the paraphernalia of modern slaughter. </p> <p>The landscape is flat and desolate. Most farms here have been condemned and there are no animals in the field. </p> <p>The white smoke of incineration pyres drifts into the van. We pass decomposing sheep carcasses piled high in the corner of fields where they have been waiting days to be picked up. The sickly stench of death hangs over some farms; in others the cattle and sheep lie sweetly together, their limbs spreadeagled, bellies swelling, tongues rigid and out. </p> <p>Scale End was condemned on Sunday, but in the watery sunlight it seems normal. At the end of a long closed road is a tangle of ancient and modern buildings. Seven lambs play in a small paddock behind the farm. A bull stalks the yard. The cattle low quietly in the barns and the sheep are penned in a field beyond. This is spring; there are daffodils on the roadside, birds in the hedges, and the Hutcheson family is waiting expectantly, as if for a relative. </p> <p>But we bring only death. The three slaughtermen change into their overalls and white suits. They smoke a cigarette and share a joke. They don't like this, they say. It is messy and too human. Yesterday a farmer cracked up. </p> <p>We cross the straw border that separates the clean from the unclean, and dip our feet in disinfectants. There are handshakes and nods. Mr Hutcheson is almost too emotional to speak, but a toothless old cowherd shows them round. \"There are plenty sheep and cattle,\" he says. </p> <p>The slaughtermen reckon several hundred cows and 400 sheep. It will take four hours, they say, and start moving machinery around the barn to prevent the animals trying to bolt. Now the cattle squeal and low and the sheep bleat hard. The legs of a cow give way and it drops to the ground. Five heads strain out of the barn. \"Of course they know,\" says one of the men. </p> <p>Mr Hutcheson paces the yard, distraught, angry and purposeful. \"It's a bloody, bloody mess. Terrible,\" he says. \"It's been chaos from start to finish. No one's told us anything. We've been surrounded for weeks. Three of us round here thought we could escape, but we found it on Sunday. That bloody Nick Brown [the agriculture minister]. How dare he stand up and say it's under bloody control. He should be here in this pen with the animals. I'd take a shotgun and give him one ...\" </p> <p>The slaughtermen return to the vans, pick up their guns, spray them with disinfectant, have another cigarette and then, like hanging judges, put on black hats. Mr Hutcheson wants it over quickly, they say. </p> <p>The doors of the green barn close behind them, the cattle low mightily and then the thuds begin. Every few seconds a thud. And another. Thud. Thud. Thud. For hour after hour the thudding goes on. They move to the sheep. The family does not watch. By six it is over. There is a deep and terrible silence and the white van heads off. </p> <p>Scale End, Laurence Holme, Raughton Head, Willow Spring, New Hope, Green March, Spare Well, Raggie Whate. The list of Cumbrian farms which the white van and other slaughter vehicles have visited this past month reads like a wartime cenotaph. So far almost 300 have been condemned and at least 100 are still waiting for the stun guns or the hauliers to take the animals to be killed near Carlisle. </p> <p>The mood across the county is desperate and fatalistic. There is now almost no farmer in Cumbria, the borders or on the high Pennines who believes he or she can or will escape. The consensus is growing that, solely because of ministry failure to act promptly, the disease has gone so far and so fast that it is now uncontrollable. Vaccination is seen by some as a futile gesture, too little and too late, but by others as the only option. </p> <p>\"We know it's just a matter of time,\" says Richard Mawdsley, on the edge of the northern fells. His flock of 400 fell sheep graze near Bassenthwaite, several miles from the nearest outbreak but close to Skiddaw and the heart of the Lake District. </p> <p>\"We can see it coming closer every day. It's lost. Its coming in now from County Durham, Weardale, Swaledale,\" says Colin Swan who has 300 breeding ewes near Brampton, east of Carlisle. </p> <p>\"They may as well give up on Cumbria now,\" said one farmer from the southern fells at a meeting in Carlisle this week. \"They should concentrate on stopping it reaching the regions where it hasn't hit yet. It's start again time in the Lake District, but I doubt that many will want to stay on.\" </p> <p>A look at the map shows how the disease is marching up the valleys, ever further into the fells from every direction. On Thursday three cases were found right on the edge of the national park, near Caldbeck. So far there has been just one case in the national park itself, but many fear it is already in the fell flocks, or has actually passed through them. It has not been spotted, they say, because the authorities have not had the resources, or perhaps the will, to check. </p> <p>But in the past few days it has ominously spread deeper into the Scottish borders, with four cases, and, significantly, into the high Pennines to the east of the lakes. This week the ministry took four days to admit that there had been an outbreak on the vast Alston Moor, preferring to say it was at \"Aldestone\", the ancient and never used name for Alston, the highest market town in Britain. </p> <p>There are mutterings of a cover up of bad news before a possible election announcement. \"The farmers are screaming for information. They are beside themselves with worry,\" says Philip Walton on whose farm the disease was found. </p> <p>The Alston Moor case could be one of the most devastating yet. \"It means that it's now on the backbone of England for the first time. It is like one great open field with tens of thousands of sheep, and it has a clear run now down south,\" says Jane Mayes, who has 30 sheep within a few miles of the outbreak. She has been leading a campaign for emergency vaccination for the sheep on the moor to stop it spreading. </p> <p>\"You can't cull them anyway up there. Some will escape. It's got a hold on the moor - at least if you vaccinate it won't come back.\" </p> <p>\"The disease is spreading like a battle group,\" says Alston vet Jim Clapp. He, too, has been advocating vaccination on the fells for weeks and banging in requests and warnings to Maff and the chief vet's office in London. This week he asked for 20,000 vaccinations but, he says: \"Maff laughed at me. The farmers could vaccinate everything in a day. They are crying for something to do.\" </p> <p>Yesterday he was called to the Maff offices, expecting the vaccines to have arrived. They had not and yet again he was frustrated. He still does not know if he will be allowed to treat the sheep, as he wants to do, and is astonished at the ministry. \"It's one terrible state of affairs,\" he says. </p> <p>The farming community, along with the thousands of businesses that depend on it and the tourism that it attracts, is in turmoil with growing social, political and scientific dissent being voiced against the National Farmers' Union and the government. Why, they ask, did it take more than three weeks before anyone from London came to the region? Why has Nick Brown never admitted the disease is out of control here? \"They'll want blood in time but for now straight talk and information would do,\" says farmer John Hitchen. </p> <p>In the past week there have been three impromptu demonstrations and a well attended meeting organised by Farmers for Action which grew out of the fuel lobby. The protesters broadly argue that Maff has betrayed everyone, the union is part of the problem, and that vaccination should not just be for cows. </p> <p>\"The slaughter policy is failing because it's always working behind the disease. Sheep farmers want vaccination but say they are being sacrificed to the economic interests of the richer dairy farmers,\" said Graham Swain who farms 30 acres in the southern lakes. \"The policy is divisive and ill-thought through.\" </p> <p>Farmers for Action have promised direct action, and called for flying squads to defend farmers. Some farmers have threatened to take direct action. \"I've got a motley crew of animals\", said one woman from the Duddon Valley. \"They will not get them. I've got chains, superglue, vicious geese, barricades and I'll lock myself up with them in my kitchen.\" </p> <p>She and others argue vehemently for vaccination without slaughter. Below the political and military reassurances, there is deep disquiet that in fact the situation is still worsening. Despite Tony Blair's intention to get the time from identification of disease to slaughter down to a day, it is taking more than four days for the carcasses to be buried or burned, with further risk of the disease spreading. </p> <p>Today, the three slaughtermen will be working flat out at the Great Orton centre outside Carlisle where a massive trench is filling with sheep and the army plans a pyre to take 15,000 cattle. It would be the biggest bonfire in British history. </p> <p>\"There won't be anything left after this,\" predicts one of the three men, stun gun in hand. \"But there won't be any work for us either.\" </p> <p><strong>Email update</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br></p> <p><strong>More on the election and foot and mouth</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><strong>What's going on?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><strong>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465571,00.html\">30.03.2001: No vaccination, cattle farmers tell Blair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465569,00.html\"> How the brigadier has mopped up chaos and won farmers' support</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465572,00.html\">30.03.2001: Organic farmer wins court battle over slaughter policy</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465565,00.html\">30.03.2001: Euthanasia drug supplies running out</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464774,00.html\">29.03.2001, George Monbiot: Foot and mouth is a good thing</a></p> <p><strong>Farmer's diary</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><strong>Interactive guides</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><strong>More on the countryside in crisis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><strong>From the Guardian archive</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><strong>Graphics</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><strong>Cartoons</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><strong>Net notes</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

There are mutterings of a cover up of bad news before a possible election announcement. \"The farmers are screaming for information. They are beside themselves with worry,\" says Philip Walton on whose farm the disease was found. The Alston Moor case could be one of the most devastating yet. \"It means that it's now on the backbone of England for the first time. It is like one great open field with tens of thousands of sheep, and it has a clear run now down south,\" says Jane Mayes, who has 30 sheep within a few miles of the outbreak. She has been leading a campaign for emergency vaccination for the sheep on the moor to stop it spreading. \"You can't cull them anyway up there. Some will escape. It's got a hold on the moor - at least if you vaccinate it won't come back.\" \"The disease is spreading like a battle group,\" says Alston vet Jim Clapp. He, too, has been advocating vaccination on the fells for weeks and banging in requests and warnings to Maff and the chief vet's office in London. This week he asked for 20,000 vaccinations but, he says: \"Maff laughed at me. The farmers could vaccinate everything in a day. They are crying for something to do.\" Yesterday he was called to the Maff offices, expecting the vaccines to have arrived. They had not and yet again he was frustrated. He still does not know if he will be allowed to treat the sheep, as he wants to do, and is astonished at the ministry. \"It's one terrible state of affairs,\" he says. The farming community, along with the thousands of businesses that depend on it and the tourism that it attracts, is in turmoil with growing social, political and scientific dissent being voiced against the National Farmers' Union and the government. Why, they ask, did it take more than three weeks before anyone from London came to the region? Why has Nick Brown never admitted the disease is out of control here? \"They'll want blood in time but for now straight talk and information would do,\" says farmer John Hitchen. In the past week there have been three impromptu demonstrations and a well attended meeting organised by Farmers for Action which grew out of the fuel lobby. The protesters broadly argue that Maff has betrayed everyone, the union is part of the problem, and that vaccination should not just be for cows. \"The slaughter policy is failing because it's always working behind the disease. Sheep farmers want vaccination but say they are being sacrificed to the economic interests of the richer dairy farmers,\" said Graham Swain who farms 30 acres in the southern lakes. \"The policy is divisive and ill-thought through.\" Farmers for Action have promised direct action, and called for flying squads to defend farmers. Some farmers have threatened to take direct action. \"I've got a motley crew of animals\", said one woman from the Duddon Valley. \"They will not get them. I've got chains, superglue, vicious geese, barricades and I'll lock myself up with them in my kitchen.\" She and others argue vehemently for vaccination without slaughter. Below the political and military reassurances, there is deep disquiet that in fact the situation is still worsening. Despite Tony Blair's intention to get the time from identification of disease to slaughter down to a day, it is taking more than four days for the carcasses to be buried or burned, with further risk of the disease spreading. Today, the three slaughtermen will be working flat out at the Great Orton centre outside Carlisle where a massive trench is filling with sheep and the army plans a pyre to take 15,000 cattle. It would be the biggest bonfire in British history. \"There won't be anything left after this,\" predicts one of the three men, stun gun in hand. \"But there won't be any work for us either.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson yesterday relaunched his political career as a champion of the country's less favoured provinces by publicly challenging Tony Blair's much-quoted dismissal of a north-south divide while calling for regional devolution to move power and wealth from London and the south-east. Parting company with the prime minister's cautious approach to constitutional reform in England, the former Northern Ireland secretary portrayed himself as a convert to the cause of regionalism and served notice that he intends to challenge ministers where necessary by arguing for greater decentralisation. Over two months after resigning from the cabinet for the second time, Mr Mandelson chose his Hartlepool constituency to deliver a carefully-crafted speech which could put him on a collision course with some former ministerial colleagues who regard English devolution as a dangerous step into uncharted political territory. Raising the stakes in the battle to persuade Tony Blair to hold a series of devolution referendums after the election, he effectively called for self-government in the north-east and other areas where there is demand and urged people to seize an historic opportunity. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, has successfully pressed Mr Blair to produce a green paper outlining the case for eight elected regional assemblies after the election. But the prime minister, who has said that talk of a north-south divide is an over-simplification, still appears uncertain over whether a case has been made for regional referendums to test support for English devolution in poorer regions like the north-east. Mr Mandelson, still smarting from his abrupt departure from the Northern Ireland post after being cleared by the Hammond inquiry in the cash-for-passports affair, was careful not to mention the prime minister by name yesterday. Mr Blair has argued that differences within regions are as wide as any north-south divide. But Mr Mandelson's inference was clear, when he said: \"Some argue that there is no longer a regional problem in the UK, only a problem with areas of greater economic and social difficulties within regions. Certainly there are sharp differences in performance between communities within the north-east. \"But the statistics show that a large performance gap between regions remains. London and the south-east is the richest region in the EU ... but in every other part of the UK standards of living are below the European average.\" His Hartlepool constituency remained \"one of the highest areas of persistent unemployment in the UK\". But a strong, centrally driven policy which attempted to bridge regional imbalances was no longer enough. Now, he said, the north-east had to reverse years of neglect, and being excluded from sharing in Britain's prosperity, by \"taking control of its own destiny\". While putting his thesis into an historical context, Mr Mandelson - who, until recently, claimed that some critics of government policy were \"talking down\" the north-east - clearly had current policy in his sights when he attacked overheating in the south-east, skill shortages, and pressure on the green belt, while other areas \"suffered industrial decimation, depopulation and decline.\" Recent figures show the north-south divide widened slightly in the present government's first three years. To correct such imbalances, Mr Mandelson called for an active regional policy running hand in glove with political devolution. He argued that this was as much in the interests of the south-east as the north. \"Perhaps transport congestion and price inflation in the south-east would in time force some businesses to break free of the markets where they have prospered,\" he said. \"They might locate elsewhere.

      "body": "<p>Amartya Sen went to a school in Bengal which promoted curiosity rather than exam results, and he has never forgotten how one of his teachers summed up a classmate: \"She is quite a serious thinker even though her grades are very good.\" In Sen's own case, the epigram needs re-phrasing. Even though he is high up in the world league of serious thinkers - a Nobel laureate in economics who could also have won the prize for philosophy if the committee recognised the subject - he has achieved something. </p> <p>Sen is a rare example of an intellectual who has had a major effect on politics. His work on the causes of famine changed public perceptions by showing why thousands might starve even when a country's food production has not diminished, and his analysis of poverty has been enormously influential. Arguing that simple measures of GNP were not enough to assess the standard of living, he helped to create the United Nations' Human Development Index, which has become the most authoritative international source of welfare comparisons between countries. </p> <p>As Master of Trinity College, Cambridge since January 1998, and the first Asian to head an Oxbridge college, Sen is also deeply immersed in the debate over globalisation. He has given lectures to senior executives of the World Bank but has also shown his commitment to reform from below by becoming honorary president of Oxfam. Most recently, he courted controversy by criticising the Runnymede report on multi-ethnicity in Britain, chaired by fellow-Asian Lord Parekh, for saying that Britain should be seen as a loose federation of cultures held together by common bonds of interest. Though this was meant to be a modern liberal vision, Sen feels it devalues individual identity, risks lumping people into \"communities\" they may not want to be part of, and interferes with a person's freedom to make her own choices. (Among his many contributions to development economics, Sen has produced pioneering studies of gender inequality, so he always takes care to write \"her\" rather than \"his\" when referring to an abstract person). </p> <p>He also jumped into the argument over human rights and \"Asian values\", taking strong issue with Singapore's former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, for claiming that liberalism was a Western export unsuited to Asia. But Sen's line was not the conventional view that individual liberty is a western invention which needs to have universal application. Rather, he argued that \"the championing of democracy and political freedom in the modern sense cannot be found in the pre-enlightenment tradition in any part of the world, west or east\". However, separate components of this progressive idea - from religious tolerance to egalitarianism and support for a climate of debate - have come and gone in many different cultures at various historical times. </p> <p>As he sits in the bay window of his elegant rooms looking out over Trinity's Great Court, dressed in baggy corduroys and a well worn tweed jacket, he looks the part of a man who is completely captivated by the seductive mix of social comfort, institutional prestige and intellectual challenge which academia at its best can provide. His carefully qualified answers and detailed recall of the themes and sub-themes of his books and articles, as well as their exact publication dates, reveal a mind and memory as sharp as his manner is gentle. </p> <p>The strongest features of his work, joining his economics and philosophy together, are ethics and a sense of common humanity. \"He's very concerned about justice\", says Sudhir Anand, professor of economics at Oxford. \"He's made major contributions not only in measuring poverty but understanding it. To him, poverty is the lack of capability to function, so reducing it is related to positive freedom. What's important to people is to be able to do and be.\" </p> <p>Sen's fellow economists love the way he has given the subject a friendlier image ,yet he was not awarded the Nobel prize for his more accessible work in development economics, but for \"social choice theory\", the philosophical foundation backed by mathematics which supports all his writings. </p> <p>The only surprise with his Nobel prize was that it came so late. \"It was only political reasons which prevented him getting it earlier,\" says his old friend, the historian Eric Hobsbawm. \"Ever since the mid-70s the Swedish committee has been strongly committed to free-market theory, until it took a real punch in the midriff in 97/98 with the Asian crisis.\" </p> <p>Though he has strong political views, Sen has generally avoided political statements in public. He is primarily an academic who wants his ideas to cascade through the institutions by virtue of their intellectual force, and then flow into general circulation as the new wisdom. \"He's peculiarly shy about talking politics publicly. It's a kind of self-denial,\" says Meghnad Desai, director of the centre for the study of global governance at the LSE. \"It's also a generational thing. Good economists, when he started out, didn't get into politics. So he prefers to be subversive in a technical way.\" </p> <p>This abstinence, as well as his soft-spoken manner, are the main reasons why Sen is relatively little-known outside the academic arena in Britain and the United States, the two countries where he has spent most of his time. Only in his native India is he a star, and when he won the Nobel prize in 1998 he was dubbed the Mother Theresa of Economics as crowds followed him around - \"wanting to touch his fountain pen,\" in Hobsbawm's words. \"The fact that he had made it in Britain gave him tremendous cachet in India, particularly among the 200,000 or so English-speakers who still run the country,\" he adds. </p> <p>Among academics Sen's reputation is almost unrivalled. He has served as a full-time or visiting professor at a dozen of the world's most prestigious universities, and must hold the record for the highest number of honorary degrees (53 according to his CV). He conscientiously turns up to receive each one and is usually asked to give a speech, winning himself the family nickname: Amartya Commencement Sen. </p> <p>\"He has a mind like a searchlight, yet he works at Mozartian speed. His output is staggering in its volume,\" comments Robert Cassen, an economist at the LSE. </p> <p>\"Sen has made fundamental contributions to at least four fields: social choice theory, welfare economics, economic measurement, and development economics,\" says Sudhir Anand. \"The pre-eminence that he has achieved in each of these different fields is remarkable for any scholar: that he has achieved pre-eminence in so many is utterly extraordinary. He is held in enormously high respect by theoretical, empirical and policy economists alike - to say nothing of philosophers and political theorists.\" </p> <p>Sen has spent almost his entire adult life on various university campuses, and was even born on one. His father taught chemistry at Dhaka University (now in Bangladesh) but Amartya came into the world in 1933 at Santiniketan, just north of Calcutta, on the campus of a small, progressive co-ed school and college founded by the writer, philosopher and poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore was a close friend of Sen's maternal grandfather who taught Sanskrit at Santiniketan. Tagore helped to choose the baby's name, which means \"immortal\" in Sanskrit. Sen's mother was a writer who performed in many of the dance-dramas which Tagore wrote. She still edits a literary magazine in Bengal. </p> <p>\"Tagore founded Santiniketan with the idea of creating something different from the English-language Raj kind of school,\" says Sen. \"It also differed from the Indian nationalist school. The teaching language was Bengali, and the place was very self-consciously international, with a sense of global culture. The existence of a Europe outside Britain was more easily conceded in Santiniketan than happened in the rest of the Raj.\" </p> <p>But the school was not for the poor, and when Sen was still only nine, he underwent a profound experience. \"One day a chap came wandering in, very obviously deranged. Some of the nastier boys were being unpleasant to him and some of us felt we had to do something to help. I got chatting to the man and it became quite clear he hadn't eaten for about 40 days. But then one, 10, it seemed like about 100,000 people came walking through the campus on the way to Calcutta to find some charities which might help them.\" </p> <p>Until this shock Sen was blissfully unaware of suffering. No one in his family, which he calls lower middle-class, nor any of his friends' families, were affected by the famine. \"I was upset by what I saw. My grandfather gave me a small cigarette tin, and said I could fill it with rice and give it to the starving, but only one tinful per family,\" he explains. The famine was clearly class-dependent. Only people on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, such as landless rural labourers, were hungry, and the memory stayed with Sen, prompting him several decades later to do his study of that famine and several others in the Sahel, Ethiopia and China. </p> <p>The opening lines of his study are typical of his lapidary style: \"Starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough food to eat. It is not the characteristic of there being not enough food to eat.\" After examining the records, he found that overall food output in Bengal in 1943 was not lower than in 1941, when there was no famine. The real problem was that the wages paid to farm labourers in 1942 had not kept up with the rising price of food caused by inflation in Calcutta, which was going through a boom as the Raj put money into war production. This resulted in what Sen called a shift in \"entitlements\": labourers had suffered a reduction in their ability to command power over food. </p> <p>As he was entering his teens, Sen had what he calls another \"devastating\" political experience. The \"idea of India\", with its rich cultural heterogeneity, which he had learned at Santiniketan, collapsed into a welter of sectarian identities when people started to define themselves as Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs, and went on killing sprees. One afternoon at the family home in Dhaka a man rushed through the gate, screaming and bleeding. Sen's father took him to hospital. The man was a Muslim labourer who had been set upon by Hindu thugs after looking for work in a Hindu area because his family was short of food. The episode turned him against the idea of prioritising communal identity, and gave him another graphic lesson in the way economic unfreedom can make people prey to serious violations of their rights. </p> <p>By then Sen was already bent on an academic career. He knew he wanted to be a teacher or researcher of some sort, though his interests wavered. \"I seriously flirted in turn with Sanskrit, mathematics and physics, before settling on the eccentric charms of economics,\" he says. </p> <p>He went to the Presidency College in Calcutta and was soon thrown into the hotbed of political coffee-house debate. His family belonged to the Bengali intellectual elite, and Bengal itself was the most vibrant and politically active city in India. Most of its luminaries were well to the left of Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru. One of Sen's uncles, who belonged to the Congress Socialist Party, was put into preventive detention by the British and spent six years in prison without trial. Another cousin, in the Communist party, was also in gaol. </p> <p>Although Sen eagerly joined in the arguments, he says: \"I could not develop enough enthusiasm to join any political party.\" It was an early sign of his detachment from collective action, as well as the pragmatic caution which have stayed with him, in spite of his moral engagement and intellectual boldness. In the early 60s, when he was at Trinity College, Cambridge, as director of studies, his then wife, Nabaneeta Dev, went on the Aldermaston ban-the-bomb marches led by Bertrand Russell. Sen did not. It was partly pressure of work, he says, but \"I had also developed more scepticism of what could be achieved by activism without necessarily weakening on the importance of the cause\". </p> <p>Sen still calls himself a person of the left, but he says he felt something disturbing about the standard leftwing politics of his student days. Most of his friends were Stalinists. He liked their egalitarian commitment but felt they were not open to political pluralism and that they even saw political tolerance as a \"weakness of will\". \"I thought it was a major defect of the Stalinist left not to recognise that establishing democracy in India had been an enormous step forward. There was a temptation to call this sham or bourgeois democracy. The left didn't take seriously enough the disastrous lack of democracy in Communist countries,\" he recalls. </p> <p>This point was to stay with him in his famine studies, when he enunciated the view that no famine has ever occurred in a country with a free press and regular elections. He compared China and India. Although by most indicators, from life expectancy to literacy, Mao's China was ahead of Nehru's India, China had had a catastrophic famine between 1958 and 1961 in which up to 30m people starved to death. There was no free press or alternative political parties to give early warning. In democratic India, free from the Raj, this could not have happened. </p> <p>But Sen did not go overboard in his praise of democracy. He pointed out in his 1984 book, Resources, Values, and Democracy, that while there was no famine in India, a third of the population went to bed hungry every night. \"The quiet presence of non-acute, endemic hunger leads to no newspaper turmoil, no political agitation, no riots in the Indian parliament. The system takes it in his stride,\" he wrote. </p> <p>When Sen arrived in Cambridge at the age of 19 to study economics at Trinity, he found the college \"a bit of an oasis\". The major debates in political economy in the university were raging between neo-classicists and followers of Keynes. Trinity was an unusual model of tolerance ,with the Marxist, Maurice Dobb, doing joint seminars with the conservative, Dennis Robertson. Sen found that this suited his style. He has always rejected any simplistic labelling of people, and his work is constantly peppered with references to earlier economists whom he respects for their views, regardless of the ideological camps which form around them. He takes examples from Adam Smith, as well as Marx, without being a Smithian or a Marxist. </p> <p>In 1960, Sen married Nabaneeta Dev, whom he first got to know when she was a student of comparative literature and he was a young professor at Jadavpur University in Calcutta. He met her off the boat train when she came to England in 1959. He proposed soon afterwards and they had two daughters. Antara, 37, became a journalist and edits a political, cultural, and literary magazine, called The Little Magazine, in Delhi. Nandana, 33, is an actress and film director, and lives in New York and Bombay. </p> <p>In 1970, S en's path-breaking book, Collective Choice and Social Welfare, attempted to rescue welfare economics from the pessimism of free-marketeers, who argued that there was no point in government intervention, and that individuals should be left to choose whatever the market made available in response to their choices, and statists, who concluded that authoritarian choices had to be made by governments on other people's behalf. Sen argued that perfection in social decision-mak ing is unnecessary. Partial comparisons between people can help and majority decisions do carry weight, as long as the interests of the less assertive citizens are not ignored. </p> <p>His own life, meanwhile, had its periods of turmoil and tragedy. While an undergraduate, he developed cancer of the mouth and he was treated with massive doses of radiation. It whittled away his palate and could have proved fatal: he was unable to eat solid food for three months and doctors said he only had a 15% chance of survival. In 1971 there were fears that the cancer had recurred but, after a while, the diagnosis proved wrong. </p> <p> That same year, Sen left Dev. She had followed him around the various campuses where his work took him, and developed her own academic career in a very different intellectual area. (By the time of the divorce, she was well-known in Bengal as a a writer and professor of literature, and the separation caused a storm there.)

      "bodyText": "Amartya Sen went to a school in Bengal which promoted curiosity rather than exam results, and he has never forgotten how one of his teachers summed up a classmate: \"She is quite a serious thinker even though her grades are very good.\" In Sen's own case, the epigram needs re-phrasing. Even though he is high up in the world league of serious thinkers - a Nobel laureate in economics who could also have won the prize for philosophy if the committee recognised the subject - he has achieved something. Sen is a rare example of an intellectual who has had a major effect on politics. His work on the causes of famine changed public perceptions by showing why thousands might starve even when a country's food production has not diminished, and his analysis of poverty has been enormously influential. Arguing that simple measures of GNP were not enough to assess the standard of living, he helped to create the United Nations' Human Development Index, which has become the most authoritative international source of welfare comparisons between countries. As Master of Trinity College, Cambridge since January 1998, and the first Asian to head an Oxbridge college, Sen is also deeply immersed in the debate over globalisation. He has given lectures to senior executives of the World Bank but has also shown his commitment to reform from below by becoming honorary president of Oxfam. Most recently, he courted controversy by criticising the Runnymede report on multi-ethnicity in Britain, chaired by fellow-Asian Lord Parekh, for saying that Britain should be seen as a loose federation of cultures held together by common bonds of interest. Though this was meant to be a modern liberal vision, Sen feels it devalues individual identity, risks lumping people into \"communities\" they may not want to be part of, and interferes with a person's freedom to make her own choices. (Among his many contributions to development economics, Sen has produced pioneering studies of gender inequality, so he always takes care to write \"her\" rather than \"his\" when referring to an abstract person). He also jumped into the argument over human rights and \"Asian values\", taking strong issue with Singapore's former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, for claiming that liberalism was a Western export unsuited to Asia. But Sen's line was not the conventional view that individual liberty is a western invention which needs to have universal application. Rather, he argued that \"the championing of democracy and political freedom in the modern sense cannot be found in the pre-enlightenment tradition in any part of the world, west or east\". However, separate components of this progressive idea - from religious tolerance to egalitarianism and support for a climate of debate - have come and gone in many different cultures at various historical times. As he sits in the bay window of his elegant rooms looking out over Trinity's Great Court, dressed in baggy corduroys and a well worn tweed jacket, he looks the part of a man who is completely captivated by the seductive mix of social comfort, institutional prestige and intellectual challenge which academia at its best can provide. His carefully qualified answers and detailed recall of the themes and sub-themes of his books and articles, as well as their exact publication dates, reveal a mind and memory as sharp as his manner is gentle. The strongest features of his work, joining his economics and philosophy together, are ethics and a sense of common humanity. \"He's very concerned about justice\", says Sudhir Anand, professor of economics at Oxford. \"He's made major contributions not only in measuring poverty but understanding it. To him, poverty is the lack of capability to function, so reducing it is related to positive freedom. What's important to people is to be able to do and be.\" Sen's fellow economists love the way he has given the subject a friendlier image ,yet he was not awarded the Nobel prize for his more accessible work in development economics, but for \"social choice theory\", the philosophical foundation backed by mathematics which supports all his writings. The only surprise with his Nobel prize was that it came so late. \"It was only political reasons which prevented him getting it earlier,\" says his old friend, the historian Eric Hobsbawm. \"Ever since the mid-70s the Swedish committee has been strongly committed to free-market theory, until it took a real punch in the midriff in 97/98 with the Asian crisis.\" Though he has strong political views, Sen has generally avoided political statements in public. He is primarily an academic who wants his ideas to cascade through the institutions by virtue of their intellectual force, and then flow into general circulation as the new wisdom. \"He's peculiarly shy about talking politics publicly. It's a kind of self-denial,\" says Meghnad Desai, director of the centre for the study of global governance at the LSE. \"It's also a generational thing. Good economists, when he started out, didn't get into politics. So he prefers to be subversive in a technical way.\" This abstinence, as well as his soft-spoken manner, are the main reasons why Sen is relatively little-known outside the academic arena in Britain and the United States, the two countries where he has spent most of his time. Only in his native India is he a star, and when he won the Nobel prize in 1998 he was dubbed the Mother Theresa of Economics as crowds followed him around - \"wanting to touch his fountain pen,\" in Hobsbawm's words. \"The fact that he had made it in Britain gave him tremendous cachet in India, particularly among the 200,000 or so English-speakers who still run the country,\" he adds. Among academics Sen's reputation is almost unrivalled. He has served as a full-time or visiting professor at a dozen of the world's most prestigious universities, and must hold the record for the highest number of honorary degrees (53 according to his CV). He conscientiously turns up to receive each one and is usually asked to give a speech, winning himself the family nickname: Amartya Commencement Sen. \"He has a mind like a searchlight, yet he works at Mozartian speed. His output is staggering in its volume,\" comments Robert Cassen, an economist at the LSE. \"Sen has made fundamental contributions to at least four fields: social choice theory, welfare economics, economic measurement, and development economics,\" says Sudhir Anand. \"The pre-eminence that he has achieved in each of these different fields is remarkable for any scholar: that he has achieved pre-eminence in so many is utterly extraordinary. He is held in enormously high respect by theoretical, empirical and policy economists alike - to say nothing of philosophers and political theorists.\" Sen has spent almost his entire adult life on various university campuses, and was even born on one. His father taught chemistry at Dhaka University (now in Bangladesh) but Amartya came into the world in 1933 at Santiniketan, just north of Calcutta, on the campus of a small, progressive co-ed school and college founded by the writer, philosopher and poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore was a close friend of Sen's maternal grandfather who taught Sanskrit at Santiniketan. Tagore helped to choose the baby's name, which means \"immortal\" in Sanskrit. Sen's mother was a writer who performed in many of the dance-dramas which Tagore wrote. She still edits a literary magazine in Bengal. \"Tagore founded Santiniketan with the idea of creating something different from the English-language Raj kind of school,\" says Sen. \"It also differed from the Indian nationalist school. The teaching language was Bengali, and the place was very self-consciously international, with a sense of global culture. The existence of a Europe outside Britain was more easily conceded in Santiniketan than happened in the rest of the Raj.\" But the school was not for the poor, and when Sen was still only nine, he underwent a profound experience. \"One day a chap came wandering in, very obviously deranged. Some of the nastier boys were being unpleasant to him and some of us felt we had to do something to help. I got chatting to the man and it became quite clear he hadn't eaten for about 40 days. But then one, 10, it seemed like about 100,000 people came walking through the campus on the way to Calcutta to find some charities which might help them.\" Until this shock Sen was blissfully unaware of suffering. No one in his family, which he calls lower middle-class, nor any of his friends' families, were affected by the famine. \"I was upset by what I saw. My grandfather gave me a small cigarette tin, and said I could fill it with rice and give it to the starving, but only one tinful per family,\" he explains. The famine was clearly class-dependent. Only people on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, such as landless rural labourers, were hungry, and the memory stayed with Sen, prompting him several decades later to do his study of that famine and several others in the Sahel, Ethiopia and China. The opening lines of his study are typical of his lapidary style: \"Starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough food to eat. It is not the characteristic of there being not enough food to eat.\" After examining the records, he found that overall food output in Bengal in 1943 was not lower than in 1941, when there was no famine. The real problem was that the wages paid to farm labourers in 1942 had not kept up with the rising price of food caused by inflation in Calcutta, which was going through a boom as the Raj put money into war production. This resulted in what Sen called a shift in \"entitlements\": labourers had suffered a reduction in their ability to command power over food. As he was entering his teens, Sen had what he calls another \"devastating\" political experience. The \"idea of India\", with its rich cultural heterogeneity, which he had learned at Santiniketan, collapsed into a welter of sectarian identities when people started to define themselves as Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs, and went on killing sprees. One afternoon at the family home in Dhaka a man rushed through the gate, screaming and bleeding. Sen's father took him to hospital. The man was a Muslim labourer who had been set upon by Hindu thugs after looking for work in a Hindu area because his family was short of food. The episode turned him against the idea of prioritising communal identity, and gave him another graphic lesson in the way economic unfreedom can make people prey to serious violations of their rights. By then Sen was already bent on an academic career. He knew he wanted to be a teacher or researcher of some sort, though his interests wavered. \"I seriously flirted in turn with Sanskrit, mathematics and physics, before settling on the eccentric charms of economics,\" he says. He went to the Presidency College in Calcutta and was soon thrown into the hotbed of political coffee-house debate. His family belonged to the Bengali intellectual elite, and Bengal itself was the most vibrant and politically active city in India. Most of its luminaries were well to the left of Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru. One of Sen's uncles, who belonged to the Congress Socialist Party, was put into preventive detention by the British and spent six years in prison without trial. Another cousin, in the Communist party, was also in gaol. Although Sen eagerly joined in the arguments, he says: \"I could not develop enough enthusiasm to join any political party.\" It was an early sign of his detachment from collective action, as well as the pragmatic caution which have stayed with him, in spite of his moral engagement and intellectual boldness. In the early 60s, when he was at Trinity College, Cambridge, as director of studies, his then wife, Nabaneeta Dev, went on the Aldermaston ban-the-bomb marches led by Bertrand Russell. Sen did not. It was partly pressure of work, he says, but \"I had also developed more scepticism of what could be achieved by activism without necessarily weakening on the importance of the cause\". Sen still calls himself a person of the left, but he says he felt something disturbing about the standard leftwing politics of his student days. Most of his friends were Stalinists. He liked their egalitarian commitment but felt they were not open to political pluralism and that they even saw political tolerance as a \"weakness of will\". \"I thought it was a major defect of the Stalinist left not to recognise that establishing democracy in India had been an enormous step forward. There was a temptation to call this sham or bourgeois democracy. The left didn't take seriously enough the disastrous lack of democracy in Communist countries,\" he recalls. This point was to stay with him in his famine studies, when he enunciated the view that no famine has ever occurred in a country with a free press and regular elections. He compared China and India. Although by most indicators, from life expectancy to literacy, Mao's China was ahead of Nehru's India, China had had a catastrophic famine between 1958 and 1961 in which up to 30m people starved to death. There was no free press or alternative political parties to give early warning. In democratic India, free from the Raj, this could not have happened. But Sen did not go overboard in his praise of democracy. He pointed out in his 1984 book, Resources, Values, and Democracy, that while there was no famine in India, a third of the population went to bed hungry every night. \"The quiet presence of non-acute, endemic hunger leads to no newspaper turmoil, no political agitation, no riots in the Indian parliament. The system takes it in his stride,\" he wrote. When Sen arrived in Cambridge at the age of 19 to study economics at Trinity, he found the college \"a bit of an oasis\". The major debates in political economy in the university were raging between neo-classicists and followers of Keynes. Trinity was an unusual model of tolerance ,with the Marxist, Maurice Dobb, doing joint seminars with the conservative, Dennis Robertson. Sen found that this suited his style. He has always rejected any simplistic labelling of people, and his work is constantly peppered with references to earlier economists whom he respects for their views, regardless of the ideological camps which form around them. He takes examples from Adam Smith, as well as Marx, without being a Smithian or a Marxist. In 1960, Sen married Nabaneeta Dev, whom he first got to know when she was a student of comparative literature and he was a young professor at Jadavpur University in Calcutta. He met her off the boat train when she came to England in 1959. He proposed soon afterwards and they had two daughters. Antara, 37, became a journalist and edits a political, cultural, and literary magazine, called The Little Magazine, in Delhi. Nandana, 33, is an actress and film director, and lives in New York and Bombay. In 1970, S en's path-breaking book, Collective Choice and Social Welfare, attempted to rescue welfare economics from the pessimism of free-marketeers, who argued that there was no point in government intervention, and that individuals should be left to choose whatever the market made available in response to their choices, and statists, who concluded that authoritarian choices had to be made by governments on other people's behalf. Sen argued that perfection in social decision-mak ing is unnecessary. Partial comparisons between people can help and majority decisions do carry weight, as long as the interests of the less assertive citizens are not ignored. His own life, meanwhile, had its periods of turmoil and tragedy. While an undergraduate, he developed cancer of the mouth and he was treated with massive doses of radiation. It whittled away his palate and could have proved fatal: he was unable to eat solid food for three months and doctors said he only had a 15% chance of survival. In 1971 there were fears that the cancer had recurred but, after a while, the diagnosis proved wrong. That same year, Sen left Dev. She had followed him around the various campuses where his work took him, and developed her own academic career in a very different intellectual area. (By the time of the divorce, she was well-known in Bengal as a a writer and professor of literature, and the separation caused a storm there.) He describes her generously \"as one of the best-known literary names in Bengal, a leading poet and novelist\". She has described him as \"a good economist but a bad money manager\", and \"a clumsy father until the children grew old enough to be his students\". Sen later started to go out with Eva Colorni, a brilliant Italian economist from a distinguished anti-fascist family, whom he had met some years earlier. The couple married in 1978, but Colorni died of cancer in 1985, leaving Sen with a 10-year-old daughter, Indrani, and eight-year-old son, Kabir. Partly in search of a change of scene, and partly because he needed a higher salary as a single father of two young children, he left Britain for Harvard. (His first two children stayed with Dev.) In the United States he renewed contact with an old student friend, the brilliant Pakistani economist, Mahbub ul Haq, who persuaded him to join in elaborating the Human Development Index as a rival to the World Bank's system of ranking countries by classical macroeconomic criteria such as savings rates and GNP. \"Amartya gave it intellectual depth and credibility. Before that people thought it was just flaky, feelgood stuff,\" says Richard Jolly, who worked for the United Nations Children's Fund and is writing a history of the UN. \"I'm struck by the way he has made so many contributions to the UN over the last three decades.\" Despite his advice for the UN, Sen has been coy about working for individual governments.

No. How do you explain this mass killing to a six-year-old? The more you try, the more stark the collective madness becomes. Those mass graves, the funeral pyres of healthy animals.

Environmentalists, to their shame, seem to have seen this solely as an opportunity for \"I told you so\", a chance to capitalise on their crusade against modern farming.</p> <p>But if environmentalism is about anything, it is about a profound challenge to human beings' terrible arrogance and destructiveness towards all other forms of life with which we share the planet. That's not just dolphins, tigers and foxes, but the thousands of cows and sheep we seem quite prepared to slaughter.</p> <p>Ah, you say, but all these lovely cows and sheep were going to be slaughtered anyway, so what's it matter if they end their lives in a limed pit a few months earlier?

      "body": "<p>Few graduates would pass up an opportunity to improve their skills working in another company, knowing they could always return to their old job. Secondments allow you to make this happen. They're growing in number and are an ideal vehicle for ambitious graduates. </p> <p>\"We persuade people to go on secondments early on in their careers, while they are still open to new ideas and before they get set in their ways,\" says John Hicks, an adviser with Interchange, a government-run scheme which gives people from different areas of the economy a chance to work in government and civil servants a taste of life in the private sector. </p> <p>John reveals that Interchange, which was launched in the seventies, has enjoyed a 28% increase in activity during the last couple of years. </p> <p>A secondment can last anything from three months to three years. Or it may involve a day a week for about six months. You are paid for going on a secondment and your salary may come with extra benefits such as living, food and travel expenses. However, if you are working in an expensive part of the country, these perceived benefits will actually be necessities. </p> <p>Big blue-chip companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst and Young offer secondments within and outside their companies. </p> <p>Christine Macaulay, a 24-year old trainee chartered accountant has been on two secondments since she joined Ernst and Young nearly three years ago. She usually works at the company's office in Inverness but has just completed a two-month secondment in London. </p> <p>\"Secondments often come up when a department has a very busy period, which is how I ended up working in London,\" says Christine, a Glasgow University graduate. </p> <p>\"London's busy time coincided with a quiet period in Inverness so I was asked if I wanted to go to London. It's not something staff have to do if they don't want to.\" </p> <p>In Inverness Christine audits the accounts of a variety of companies, but in London she specialised in auditing the accounts of media companies. </p> <p>\"It was good for me career-wise because I gained knowledge of a different industry and built new contacts. If I decide to move around internally, I've got ready-made contacts who are familiar with my work.\" </p> <p>Christine also learned how to adapt to living and working in London: the different mix of people, the fast pace of life and the arduous journey on the tube during rush hour. </p> <p>\"It's been a stark contrast to life and work in Inverness where the pace is slower, I can walk to work in 20 minutes and drive to the countryside within ten minutes from the centre of town,\" she says. </p> <p>Christine's first secondment in the summer of last year was near her home in Inverness. \"I worked for five months in a company on a consultancy basis, giving business and accounting advice. </p> <p>\"I learned a lot about how to get my point across, while taking other people's objectives and perspectives into consideration. It gave me greater confidence to speak out when dealing with clients.\" </p> <p>Secondments come highly recommended from Christine. \"It gives you a chance to try out a certain industry and get paid,\" she says. </p> <p>Christine wants to continue auditing but doesn't know which industry to specialise in yet. So inevitably this will mean a few more secondments. \"One abroad for a couple of years would be pretty cool.\" </p> <p>A secondment could improve your chances of promotion when you return to your old job, though don't expect it to happen overnight. </p> <p>Of course, sometimes a secondment may not be of your choosing.

      "bodyText": "Few graduates would pass up an opportunity to improve their skills working in another company, knowing they could always return to their old job. Secondments allow you to make this happen. They're growing in number and are an ideal vehicle for ambitious graduates. \"We persuade people to go on secondments early on in their careers, while they are still open to new ideas and before they get set in their ways,\" says John Hicks, an adviser with Interchange, a government-run scheme which gives people from different areas of the economy a chance to work in government and civil servants a taste of life in the private sector. John reveals that Interchange, which was launched in the seventies, has enjoyed a 28% increase in activity during the last couple of years. A secondment can last anything from three months to three years. Or it may involve a day a week for about six months. You are paid for going on a secondment and your salary may come with extra benefits such as living, food and travel expenses. However, if you are working in an expensive part of the country, these perceived benefits will actually be necessities. Big blue-chip companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst and Young offer secondments within and outside their companies. Christine Macaulay, a 24-year old trainee chartered accountant has been on two secondments since she joined Ernst and Young nearly three years ago. She usually works at the company's office in Inverness but has just completed a two-month secondment in London. \"Secondments often come up when a department has a very busy period, which is how I ended up working in London,\" says Christine, a Glasgow University graduate. \"London's busy time coincided with a quiet period in Inverness so I was asked if I wanted to go to London. It's not something staff have to do if they don't want to.\" In Inverness Christine audits the accounts of a variety of companies, but in London she specialised in auditing the accounts of media companies. \"It was good for me career-wise because I gained knowledge of a different industry and built new contacts. If I decide to move around internally, I've got ready-made contacts who are familiar with my work.\" Christine also learned how to adapt to living and working in London: the different mix of people, the fast pace of life and the arduous journey on the tube during rush hour. \"It's been a stark contrast to life and work in Inverness where the pace is slower, I can walk to work in 20 minutes and drive to the countryside within ten minutes from the centre of town,\" she says. Christine's first secondment in the summer of last year was near her home in Inverness. \"I worked for five months in a company on a consultancy basis, giving business and accounting advice. \"I learned a lot about how to get my point across, while taking other people's objectives and perspectives into consideration. It gave me greater confidence to speak out when dealing with clients.\" Secondments come highly recommended from Christine. \"It gives you a chance to try out a certain industry and get paid,\" she says. Christine wants to continue auditing but doesn't know which industry to specialise in yet. So inevitably this will mean a few more secondments. \"One abroad for a couple of years would be pretty cool.\" A secondment could improve your chances of promotion when you return to your old job, though don't expect it to happen overnight. Of course, sometimes a secondment may not be of your choosing. However, it is vital that you adopt a positive attitude. If you don't, it is extremely unlikely that you will gain from the experience. Focus on the positive and see it as a finite amount of time in which to learn all you can.",

Other new entries include Cisco Systems (31st), Audi (37th), Sun Microsystems (49th), PA Consulting (57th), NTL (77th), Johnson &amp; Johnson (78th), ABB (90th), Pharmacia (99th) and Bayer (100th). Despite the hype surrounding start-ups and internet companies last year, this year's rankings suggest that large employers are back on top - a reflection perhaps of current worries about recession and job insecurity. \"Our research this year suggests graduates are seeking more balance between their personal lives and careers. This is, possibly why we have seen the financial institutions drop in the ranking list because graduates view them as rigid corporate environments, with long working hours,\" says Maria Cansick, spokesperson for Universum which specialises in graduate recruitment. \"Graduates also want employers who can offer increasingly challenging tasks and the chance to work internationally. It could be one reason why the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office has been nominated as the ideal employer and consulting is still one of the most popular career paths.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Senior cabinet ministers and officials at Labour headquarters at Millbank are piling pressure on Tony Blair not to delay a May 3 general election, amid signs that the prime minister's visits to struggling farming communities have persuaded him of the necessity of postponement during the foot and mouth epidemic.</p> <p>Senior ministers claim that Mr Blair now sees himself as the \"father of the nation\" and is in the mood to make a decision in what he regards as the national interest. Mr Blair yesterday visited farms in Dumfries and the regional control centre in Newcastle.</p> <p>The tourist industry also made a desperate call for him to press ahead, warning that delaying the local elections would cripple rural economies by sending the wrong message to tourists at a vital time.</p> <p>Following a meeting in Manchester, regional tourist directors warned that the industry was on the verge of losing \u00a31bn a month in takings. Dorothy Naylor, chairman of the regional directors of English tourist boards, said: \"We need confident and assertive decisions from the government and delay of the local elections, or general election will send just the wrong message\".</p> <p>But with the decision 48 hours away, Mr Blair is being inundated by conflicting advice, with some of his closest advisers at Downing Street and his local constituency in Sedgefield urging a delay. A postponement is also being urged by the influential Lord Falconer and by the pollster Philip Gould, who has warned that 25 seats could be lost if an election is held on May 3.</p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the party's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, all support May 3 to various degrees, but recognise that the judgment is finally balanced.</p> <p>In a sign of the divisions even among Labour modernisers, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, is urging a postponement and the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, supports May 3.</p> <p>In encouraging news for Mr Blair, a senior scientist advising the government on the likely course of the epidemic said yesterday that if the number of new cases today and tomorrow stayed below 60, it would suggest the disease was being beaten.</p> <p>Professor Roy Anderson of Imperial College London, a member of one of three teams of epidemiologists feeding forecasts to the government, said the next few days were critical.</p> <p>\"There are some encouraging signs in the epidemic,\" he said. \"This week is crucial. If the cases this weekend stay around the 30 or 40 mark, or even a little bit higher - the 50s is all right - that's good news. If they don't, there's a lot more effort to be made.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown meanwhile met his closest advisers, including leading US Democrats, in a Soho restaurant on Thursday night to discuss tactics.

      "bodyText": "Senior cabinet ministers and officials at Labour headquarters at Millbank are piling pressure on Tony Blair not to delay a May 3 general election, amid signs that the prime minister's visits to struggling farming communities have persuaded him of the necessity of postponement during the foot and mouth epidemic. Senior ministers claim that Mr Blair now sees himself as the \"father of the nation\" and is in the mood to make a decision in what he regards as the national interest. Mr Blair yesterday visited farms in Dumfries and the regional control centre in Newcastle. The tourist industry also made a desperate call for him to press ahead, warning that delaying the local elections would cripple rural economies by sending the wrong message to tourists at a vital time. Following a meeting in Manchester, regional tourist directors warned that the industry was on the verge of losing \u00a31bn a month in takings. Dorothy Naylor, chairman of the regional directors of English tourist boards, said: \"We need confident and assertive decisions from the government and delay of the local elections, or general election will send just the wrong message\". But with the decision 48 hours away, Mr Blair is being inundated by conflicting advice, with some of his closest advisers at Downing Street and his local constituency in Sedgefield urging a delay. A postponement is also being urged by the influential Lord Falconer and by the pollster Philip Gould, who has warned that 25 seats could be lost if an election is held on May 3. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the party's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, all support May 3 to various degrees, but recognise that the judgment is finally balanced. In a sign of the divisions even among Labour modernisers, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, is urging a postponement and the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, supports May 3. In encouraging news for Mr Blair, a senior scientist advising the government on the likely course of the epidemic said yesterday that if the number of new cases today and tomorrow stayed below 60, it would suggest the disease was being beaten. Professor Roy Anderson of Imperial College London, a member of one of three teams of epidemiologists feeding forecasts to the government, said the next few days were critical. \"There are some encouraging signs in the epidemic,\" he said. \"This week is crucial. If the cases this weekend stay around the 30 or 40 mark, or even a little bit higher - the 50s is all right - that's good news. If they don't, there's a lot more effort to be made.\" Mr Brown meanwhile met his closest advisers, including leading US Democrats, in a Soho restaurant on Thursday night to discuss tactics. Some warned that foot and mouth could dominate the election campaign for two weeks. Mr Blair's fateful decision is likely to be taken at a Chequers summit tomorrow, by which time the latest figures on the spread of the outbreak will be available. Amid tentative signs that the disease may be abating, he delayed until Monday a decision on whether to press ahead with vaccination of dairy cattle in Cumbria. The Ministry of Agriculture, was not officially releasing fresh figures, but said that 780 cases had been confirmed with 200,000 sheep in the neighbouring zones. Among the farmers Mr Blair met was Donald Biggar, from Castle Douglas, who had watched more than 300 of his pedigree livestock shot with stun guns the night before. Mr Biggar said: \"I think [the prime minister] saw the emotion in it and the need to support the industry.\" Emerging from the meeting, Mr Blair said he had heard some \"really heart-rendering accounts. It is a tragic and terrible situation for people here and I can only imagine the distress that is felt\".

      "bodyText": "Senior cabinet ministers and officials at Labour headquarters at Millbank are piling pressure on Tony Blair not to delay a May 3 general election, amid signs that the prime minister's visits to struggling farming communities have persuaded him of the necessity of postponement during the foot and mouth epidemic. Senior ministers claim that Mr Blair now sees himself as the \"father of the nation\" and is in the mood to make a decision in what he regards as the national interest. Mr Blair yesterday visited farms in Dumfries and the regional control centre in Newcastle. The tourist industry also made a desperate call for him to press ahead, warning that delaying the local elections would cripple rural economies by sending the wrong message to tourists at a vital time. Following a meeting in Manchester, regional tourist directors warned that the industry was on the verge of losing \u00a31bn a month in takings. Dorothy Naylor, chairman of the regional directors of English tourist boards, said: \"We need confident and assertive decisions from the government and delay of the local elections, or general election will send just the wrong message\". But with the decision 48 hours away, Mr Blair is being inundated by conflicting advice, with some of his closest advisers at Downing Street and his local constituency in Sedgefield urging a delay. A postponement is also being urged by the influential Lord Falconer and by the pollster Philip Gould, who has warned that 25 seats could be lost if an election is held on May 3. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the party's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, all support May 3 to various degrees, but recognise that the judgment is finally balanced. In a sign of the divisions even among Labour modernisers, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, is urging a postponement and the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, supports May 3. In encouraging news for Mr Blair, a senior scientist advising the government on the likely course of the epidemic said yesterday that if the number of new cases today and tomorrow stayed below 60, it would suggest the disease was being beaten. Professor Roy Anderson of Imperial College London, a member of one of three teams of epidemiologists feeding forecasts to the government, said the next few days were critical. \"There are some encouraging signs in the epidemic,\" he said. \"This week is crucial. If the cases this weekend stay around the 30 or 40 mark, or even a little bit higher - the 50s is all right - that's good news. If they don't, there's a lot more effort to be made.\" Mr Brown meanwhile met his closest advisers, including leading US Democrats, in a Soho restaurant on Thursday night to discuss tactics. Some warned that foot and mouth could dominate the election campaign for two weeks. Mr Blair's fateful decision is likely to be taken at a Chequers summit tomorrow, by which time the latest figures on the spread of the outbreak will be available. Amid tentative signs that the disease may be abating, he delayed until Monday a decision on whether to press ahead with vaccination of dairy cattle in Cumbria. The Ministry of Agriculture, was not officially releasing fresh figures, but said that 780 cases had been confirmed with 200,000 sheep in the neighbouring zones. Among the farmers Mr Blair met was Donald Biggar, from Castle Douglas, who had watched more than 300 of his pedigree livestock shot with stun guns the night before. Mr Biggar said: \"I think [the prime minister] saw the emotion in it and the need to support the industry.\" Emerging from the meeting, Mr Blair said he had heard some \"really heart-rendering accounts. It is a tragic and terrible situation for people here and I can only imagine the distress that is felt\".

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson yesterday relaunched his political career as a champion of the country's less favoured provinces by publicly challenging Tony Blair's much-quoted dismissal of a north-south divide while calling for regional devolution to move power and wealth from London and the south-east. Parting company with the prime minister's cautious approach to constitutional reform in England, the former Northern Ireland secretary portrayed himself as a convert to the cause of regionalism and served notice that he intends to challenge ministers where necessary by arguing for greater decentralisation. Over two months after resigning from the cabinet for the second time, Mr Mandelson chose his Hartlepool constituency to deliver a carefully-crafted speech which could put him on a collision course with some former ministerial colleagues who regard English devolution as a dangerous step into uncharted political territory. Raising the stakes in the battle to persuade Tony Blair to hold a series of devolution referendums after the election, he effectively called for self-government in the north-east and other areas where there is demand and urged people to seize an historic opportunity. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, has successfully pressed Mr Blair to produce a green paper outlining the case for eight elected regional assemblies after the election. But the prime minister, who has said that talk of a north-south divide is an over-simplification, still appears uncertain over whether a case has been made for regional referendums to test support for English devolution in poorer regions like the north-east. Mr Mandelson, still smarting from his abrupt departure from the Northern Ireland post after being cleared by the Hammond inquiry in the cash-for-passports affair, was careful not to mention the prime minister by name yesterday. Mr Blair has argued that differences within regions are as wide as any north-south divide. But Mr Mandelson's inference was clear, when he said: \"Some argue that there is no longer a regional problem in the UK, only a problem with areas of greater economic and social difficulties within regions. Certainly there are sharp differences in performance between communities within the north-east. \"But the statistics show that a large performance gap between regions remains. London and the south-east is the richest region in the EU ... but in every other part of the UK standards of living are below the European average.\" His Hartlepool constituency remained \"one of the highest areas of persistent unemployment in the UK\". But a strong, centrally driven policy which attempted to bridge regional imbalances was no longer enough. Now, he said, the north-east had to reverse years of neglect, and being excluded from sharing in Britain's prosperity, by \"taking control of its own destiny\". While putting his thesis into an historical context, Mr Mandelson - who, until recently, claimed that some critics of government policy were \"talking down\" the north-east - clearly had current policy in his sights when he attacked overheating in the south-east, skill shortages, and pressure on the green belt, while other areas \"suffered industrial decimation, depopulation and decline.\" Recent figures show the north-south divide widened slightly in the present government's first three years. To correct such imbalances, Mr Mandelson called for an active regional policy running hand in glove with political devolution. He argued that this was as much in the interests of the south-east as the north. \"Perhaps transport congestion and price inflation in the south-east would in time force some businesses to break free of the markets where they have prospered,\" he said. \"They might locate elsewhere. But there is no guarantee. And those market forces are just as likely to drive investment away from poorer regions.\"",

      "byline": "Mark Lawson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Whatever qualities Tony Blair has displayed in office, he has never actually seemed mad, a charge routinely levelled against Margaret Thatcher. But a May or even June election now seems to me insanity. What the poll tax was to Thatcher, the poll date would become to Blair. He might continue in office, but his judgment would be suspected ever after; this single decision would become a focus for the doubts about him.</p> <p>What's most astonishing is that the people reportedly keenest on a May 3 election are the invisible Millbank operatives who run the campaign. This seems largely to be a case of inertia motivation, like someone carrying on with the reception and the honeymoon even though their partner ran screaming from the church before the vows. It would be a fitting epitaph for the age of spin if these types prove to have thrown away power purely because they had booked their holidays in Tuscany for the middle of May.</p> <p>Oh, I know what they say. The opinion polls remain stable. The media and the public are tiring of sick-cow disease as a story. The farming lands vote Tory or Lib Dem anyway. William Hague wouldn't be electable even if Blair were caught in bed with a troop of boy scouts on May 2. All this may be true. But what these professional campaigners are ignoring is that their biggest problem is the campaign itself and its effect on the prime minister's subsequent image.</p> <p>Consider first the question of posters and election broadcasts. We can guess what was planned: pictures of Tony grinning amid delighted cancer patients, schoolchildren and investment bankers. Now, if these images run, the public will have in their heads an alternative spool of rural inedible barbecues and army marksmen.</p> <p>Last Sunday, Rory Bremner ran a sketch in which a Blair speech about how he had changed Britain beyond recognition was intercut with footage of the victims of bovine firing squads. One of the effects of satire is to expose the weak areas in a person and Blair must realise that any triumphalist speech he made would be rendered comic by public knowledge of the reality.</p> <p>Millbank should also reflect that the Tories, in their posters and commercials, will produce a version of the Bremner sketch. Until six weeks ago, you felt sorry for Conservative copywriters. After four years of presidential-style competence, Blair offered no obvious target for attack. What could Hague's slogan be?</p> <p>Now the possibilities pile up like massacred cattle. \"What Are They So Afraid Of After May?\" against pictures of Wall Street screens cascading. Pictures of the farmyards which are now graveyards with the copyline: \"Let The Country Decide\". Even, perhaps, a split-screen with Margaret Thatcher on one side and a proud Friesian eating grass on the other and a deep voice intoning: \"You might have been glad to get rid of this cow but did you really want to get rid of all these?\"</p> <p>Another worry for Labour is Blair's demeanour. Although accused of obsession with presentation, this PM has never been able to spin his emotions. Under pressure, he looks instantly old and ill. The last six weeks have already aged him by two years. Any Kennedyesque campaign planned by his handlers will now look as if it's got George Bush senior in it.</p> <p>The candidate is also uncomfortable with tough interviews. Earlier this year, it was hard to see how the television and radio interrogations during the campaign could be spun out to half an hour. Now foot and mouth - as a peg for questions on arrogance, competence and fear of the economic future - could fill half an hour alone.</p> <p>The most intriguing shapes in the white smoke coming out of Labour HQ are suggestions that Blair might distance himself from the campaigning, leaving the chancellor to be Labour's face on the hustings. This scheme has the initial problem of being entirely illogical.

      "bodyText": "Whatever qualities Tony Blair has displayed in office, he has never actually seemed mad, a charge routinely levelled against Margaret Thatcher. But a May or even June election now seems to me insanity. What the poll tax was to Thatcher, the poll date would become to Blair. He might continue in office, but his judgment would be suspected ever after; this single decision would become a focus for the doubts about him. What's most astonishing is that the people reportedly keenest on a May 3 election are the invisible Millbank operatives who run the campaign. This seems largely to be a case of inertia motivation, like someone carrying on with the reception and the honeymoon even though their partner ran screaming from the church before the vows. It would be a fitting epitaph for the age of spin if these types prove to have thrown away power purely because they had booked their holidays in Tuscany for the middle of May. Oh, I know what they say. The opinion polls remain stable. The media and the public are tiring of sick-cow disease as a story. The farming lands vote Tory or Lib Dem anyway. William Hague wouldn't be electable even if Blair were caught in bed with a troop of boy scouts on May 2. All this may be true. But what these professional campaigners are ignoring is that their biggest problem is the campaign itself and its effect on the prime minister's subsequent image. Consider first the question of posters and election broadcasts. We can guess what was planned: pictures of Tony grinning amid delighted cancer patients, schoolchildren and investment bankers. Now, if these images run, the public will have in their heads an alternative spool of rural inedible barbecues and army marksmen. Last Sunday, Rory Bremner ran a sketch in which a Blair speech about how he had changed Britain beyond recognition was intercut with footage of the victims of bovine firing squads. One of the effects of satire is to expose the weak areas in a person and Blair must realise that any triumphalist speech he made would be rendered comic by public knowledge of the reality. Millbank should also reflect that the Tories, in their posters and commercials, will produce a version of the Bremner sketch. Until six weeks ago, you felt sorry for Conservative copywriters. After four years of presidential-style competence, Blair offered no obvious target for attack. What could Hague's slogan be? Now the possibilities pile up like massacred cattle. \"What Are They So Afraid Of After May?\" against pictures of Wall Street screens cascading. Pictures of the farmyards which are now graveyards with the copyline: \"Let The Country Decide\". Even, perhaps, a split-screen with Margaret Thatcher on one side and a proud Friesian eating grass on the other and a deep voice intoning: \"You might have been glad to get rid of this cow but did you really want to get rid of all these?\" Another worry for Labour is Blair's demeanour. Although accused of obsession with presentation, this PM has never been able to spin his emotions. Under pressure, he looks instantly old and ill. The last six weeks have already aged him by two years. Any Kennedyesque campaign planned by his handlers will now look as if it's got George Bush senior in it. The candidate is also uncomfortable with tough interviews. Earlier this year, it was hard to see how the television and radio interrogations during the campaign could be spun out to half an hour. Now foot and mouth - as a peg for questions on arrogance, competence and fear of the economic future - could fill half an hour alone. The most intriguing shapes in the white smoke coming out of Labour HQ are suggestions that Blair might distance himself from the campaigning, leaving the chancellor to be Labour's face on the hustings. This scheme has the initial problem of being entirely illogical. If the country is in such crisis that the PM can't campaign, then why is he holding an unnecessary poll anyway? However, such a strategy would have the benefit of connecting the so far carefully distanced Mr Brown with the government's troubles. It would be him submitting to Paxman's pulled faces, Humphrys's impatient snort and the placards of protesters. This could be a useful precautionary culling of a potential rival if the prime minister were to find himself returned to power but weakened. The final point that Blair should consider this weekend at Chequers is historical. This column has often referred to the tendency of Britain and America since the 70s to have leaders paired by ideology or circumstance: Callaghan/Ford (unelected); Thatcher/Reagan (charismatic monetarist); and Blair/Clinton (youthful presentationalist). So who's the most fitting twin for George Bush? Optimistic Conservatives have concluded from these parallels that Britain will now follow America in electing a rightwing half-wit who no one can quite believe got the job. This remains unlikely, but the British system probably is about to produce a political pair for Bush by choosing a leader so undermined by the grubby conditions of his election that he surrenders all political legitimacy. For the disenfranchisement of Florida, read the theft of electoral rights from the countryside.

      "bodyText": "The Taliban's supreme spiritual leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, has privately ruled out handing over Osama bin Laden for trial and has said he is ready to \"sacrifice\" what is left of his shattered country before giving up his \"guest\" to the US, it emerged last night. Sources in Kabul made it clear that there was no prospect of the Saudi dissident, accused by the US of carrying out the embassy bombings which killed 224 people in east Africa in 1998, being forced to leave his base in Afghanistan. The FBI has put Mr Bin Laden near the top of its most wanted list and has offered a $5m (\u00a33.5m) reward for his capture. It has accused his fundamentalist group, al-Qaeda, of promoting international terrorism and carrying out attacks on US army personnel. Mr Bin Laden has operated from secret camps in southern and central Afghanistan since 1996. \"Half of my country has been destroyed by two decades of war. If the remaining half is also destroyed in trying to protect Mr Bin Laden, I'm willing for this sacrifice,\" Mullah Omar said last week. \"He is not going to be handed over if there is any prospect he will be convicted,\" a Taliban source confirmed. Last month the Taliban's foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, indicated that the Taliban might be prepared to hand Mr Bin Laden over to another Muslim country where the evidence against him could be weighed by a panel of Islamic scholars. This proposal, rejected by the US, has now been shelved. Officially the Taliban say they are still willing to discuss the issue; the new hardline position emerged after a dramatic power struggle in the movement. The \"ultra-fundamentalists\" who have close links with Mr Bin Laden have consolidated their grip, sources say. Key moderates who advocated a degree of engagement with the west, including the culture minister, Abdul Rahman Hotaki, have been sacked. One reliable Taliban source in Kabul said Shaikh Taseer Abdullah - also known as Abu Hafs - who is Mr Bin Laden's deputy and key military aide, was the \"mastermind\" of al-Qaeda. \"You have to remember that Osama is not educated. All of the key decisions concerning al-Qaeda are taken by the Egyptian [Shaikh Abdullah],\" the source said. Sources said the Taliban were planning to impose further restrictions on foreign-aid workers living in Kabul and other Afghan cities. \"Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better,\" a one said last night. \"Those within the Taliban who believe Afghanistan should be a laboratory for their puritanical Islamic ideas are firmly in control.\"",

The system was designed to predict future cases of foot and mouth in the event of an outbreak of the disease.</p> <p>But government spending cuts meant funding was switched to BSE and the computer system was instead designated to track BSE.</p> <p>The system had been developed by Roger Morris, an authority on foot and mouth based at Massey University, New Zealand.</p> <p>Speaking to Farmers Weekly, Professor Morris claimed that the scheme would have been able to speedily predict the scale of the epidemic. \"Undoubtedly fewer cases of the disease would have occurred.

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Agriculture has been accused of failing to install a powerful computer system purchased two years ago with the intention of preventing a foot and mouth epidemic. Maff officials purchased a computer tracking system known as EpiMan in the late 1990s. The system was designed to predict future cases of foot and mouth in the event of an outbreak of the disease. But government spending cuts meant funding was switched to BSE and the computer system was instead designated to track BSE. The system had been developed by Roger Morris, an authority on foot and mouth based at Massey University, New Zealand. Speaking to Farmers Weekly, Professor Morris claimed that the scheme would have been able to speedily predict the scale of the epidemic. \"Undoubtedly fewer cases of the disease would have occurred. We could have damped the disease down much more quickly.\" When the foot and mouth crisis broke in February, Maff experts finally decided that the system should be installed. But they could not work out how to do it. Maff was forced to fly in a team of specialists from New Zealand. Prof Morris said: \"The team from New Zealand took just four days to install the system.\" However, Maff denied the accusation, saying that Prof Morris contacted Maff and offered to install his computer system. Maff officials said that his system was working alongside their own at the ministry's headquarters. Prof Morris's computer system holds detailed maps of the UK and information on factors influencing the spread of the disease, such as weather and terrain. He said the system could have raised the alarm earlier in the crisis that Maff alone could not deal with the outbreak. The news comes on top of the revelation that Maff failed to undergo any exercises on the possibility of a foot and mouth epidemic. There are increasing signs that the crisis will sound the death knell of Maff in its current form after the election. Stephen Tindale, former special adviser to Michael Meacher, environment minister, has already called for the shutdown of Maff. Many in Whitehall believe the rural task force chaired by Mr Meacher represents the new ministry of rural affairs in embryo. The new body would cover not just agriculture, but also the rural community.

It states categorically: \"Intellectual property rights [patents] are the lifeblood of the innovative pharmaceutical industry.\"</p> <p>The government and industry say they are \"acutely aware of the growing HIV/Aids epidemic in Africa and their responsibilities in responding to it\". The report goes on: \"There is much that can be done to reduce the impact of Aids and to improve access to medicines. However, intellectual property protection is not per se a barrier to access to medicines and attempts to weaken it would be counter-productive.\"</p> <p>The government's uncompromising stance is out of line with the growing mood of concern in other European countries about the unaffordable cost of medicines in poor countries where Aids, tuberculosis and malaria are killing millions. The inequities have been highlighted by a court case brought by 39 drug companies to stop legislation that would allow the South African government to import medicines that are cheaper elsewhere. Two weeks ago, the European parliament called on the drug companies to drop their legal action.</p> <p>\"It does look as if the government is capitulating to big business,\" said Sophia Tickell, senior policy adviser at Oxfam which is campaigning for access to cheap medicines. \"It is very difficult to see any other interpretation. It seems a backward step and out of line with a growing number of other governments.\"</p> <p>The report has been published just as Merck, one of the companies involved in the South African case, has threatened legal action against Brazil. Brazil is hailed as a blueprint for the developing world for managing to treat a significant proportion of its HIV-positive population by passing controversial laws to allow it to manufacture cheap copies of eight of the patented drugs used to keep the virus at bay. Since 1997, when it began to make its own versions, hospital admissions for Aids-related illnesses have dropped by 80% and deaths by a half. Brazil has brought the cost of treating patients down from $7,858 a year in 1997 to $4,137. In the US, treatment costs between $10,000 and $15,000.</p> <p>Merck is now trying to ban Brazil's state-owned pharmaceutical company from importing Efavirenz, an Indian generic version of its drug Stocrin, with a view to making its own copy. A tenth of Brazil's Aids budget is spent on the drug, which is only available at high western prices. Brazil has said it will not make the drug if Merck drops its price significantly.</p> <p>While United Nations agencies and charities have welcomed the lowering of medicine prices in the developing world which has come about as a result of the recent fierce generic competition and grassroots campaigns in countries such as South Africa, the UK government is now publicly backing the position of the pharmaceutical giants.</p> <p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the government shared its position on patents. \"It [the government] recognises the importance of intellectual property rights in the development of new medicines,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>The report is the product of a joint industry/government taskforce set up a year ago after drug companies warned they might take their business elsewhere if the UK clamped down on the price at which they sell medicines to the NHS. It makes clear that the government recognises the threat and wants to do all it can to persuade the industry, which is hugely profitable for Britain, to stay here.</p> <p>\"The UK must continue to offer a supportive and competitive business environment compared to other viable locations,\" the document says.</p> <p>The prime minister, in a foreword, says: \"I am committed to ensuring that the UK retains the features that have made it an attractive location for investment - features such as the availability of a high quality scientific workforce, protection of intellectual property, a supportive regulatory framework and an environment conducive to the research needed to discover the cures of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The report can be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/pictf/pictf.pdf\" target=\"_NEW\">www.doh.gov.uk</a></p>",

Brazil is hailed as a blueprint for the developing world for managing to treat a significant proportion of its HIV-positive population by passing controversial laws to allow it to manufacture cheap copies of eight of the patented drugs used to keep the virus at bay. Since 1997, when it began to make its own versions, hospital admissions for Aids-related illnesses have dropped by 80% and deaths by a half. Brazil has brought the cost of treating patients down from $7,858 a year in 1997 to $4,137. In the US, treatment costs between $10,000 and $15,000. Merck is now trying to ban Brazil's state-owned pharmaceutical company from importing Efavirenz, an Indian generic version of its drug Stocrin, with a view to making its own copy. A tenth of Brazil's Aids budget is spent on the drug, which is only available at high western prices. Brazil has said it will not make the drug if Merck drops its price significantly. While United Nations agencies and charities have welcomed the lowering of medicine prices in the developing world which has come about as a result of the recent fierce generic competition and grassroots campaigns in countries such as South Africa, the UK government is now publicly backing the position of the pharmaceutical giants. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the government shared its position on patents. \"It [the government] recognises the importance of intellectual property rights in the development of new medicines,\" a spokesman said. The report is the product of a joint industry/government taskforce set up a year ago after drug companies warned they might take their business elsewhere if the UK clamped down on the price at which they sell medicines to the NHS. It makes clear that the government recognises the threat and wants to do all it can to persuade the industry, which is hugely profitable for Britain, to stay here. \"The UK must continue to offer a supportive and competitive business environment compared to other viable locations,\" the document says. The prime minister, in a foreword, says: \"I am committed to ensuring that the UK retains the features that have made it an attractive location for investment - features such as the availability of a high quality scientific workforce, protection of intellectual property, a supportive regulatory framework and an environment conducive to the research needed to discover the cures of the 21st century.\" \u0095 The report can be accessed at www.doh.gov.uk",

      "bodyText": "On the eve of the US deadline for Slobodan Milosevic to be taken into detention, police movements near the former Yugoslav president's home in Belgrade raised speculation in the capital that he was in effect being put under house arrest. A police van, several other vehicles and an ambulance parked near the villa were taken as an indication that the security units guarding him were being augmented or replaced. The Serbian parliament went into an unscheduled session and was expected to sit until midnight, increasing the expectations of an announcement about Mr Milosevic, who is under investigation at home for a range of alleged crimes, and has been indicted for war crimes by the Hague tribunal. The new Serbian government has been facing its sharpest dilemma since taking office in January, in the form of the US ultimatum to arrest Mr Milosevic by today, the deadline set by congress for US aid to be cut off unless Serbia cooperates fully with the tribunal. More important, its failure to meet the deadline could prompt the US to vote on the governing bodies of the international financial institutions against further aid to Serbia and Yugoslavia, which desperately need foreign funds for reconstruction. It was unclear last night whether the expected parliamentary announcement and the movement around the Milosevic residence signalled that concrete steps would be traken or were mainly symbolic, undertaken in the hope that Washington would be placated for now. Western diplomats in the city have suggested in recent days that it could be May before Mr Milosevic is taken into custody. While senior officials in Belgrade are keen to see Mr Milosevic apprehended, they say they are being pushed too far too fast by the US, and they are pleading for more time to build a watertight legal case against him. Belgrade's stance has infuriated the Hague war crimes tribunal, which has charged Mr Milosevic and four of his associates with involvement in crimes against humanity in Kosovo and is preparing new charges against him in connection with the wars in Croatia and Bosnia in 1991-95. But the Americans are not insisting that Mr Milosevic must be extradited immediately to the Hague, rather that he be taken into custody at home and tried in Belgrade. \"There's no one here who does not want Milosevic in prison,\" said Goran Pitic, the foreign trade minister. \"We're totally committed to Milosevic and his associates being sanctioned for what they did. The main thing is to have Milosevic in jail somewhere, and that's the signal the Americans are looking for.\" The congressional bill enacted last autumn demands full Serbian cooperation with the Hague tribunal. It does not explicitly say Mr Milosevic has to be arrested, but US officials have told Belgrade that this is what full cooperation means. As the Serbian media issue a daily diet of revelations about the alleged thuggery and corruption of the former regime, public opinion is also swinging against leaving Mr Milosevic at liberty. Opinion polls show a majority of Serbs now want ing him arrested and a growing minority supporting his extradition to the Hague. The signals from Washington in recent days suggest that Belgrade is doing enough to avoid the congressional and administration censure. In the past week the Serbian authorities have arrested eight associates of Mr Milosevic and for the first time ever arrested a Bosnian Serb charged by the tribunal and extradited him to the Hague. But the arrest and extradition of Vladimir Stakic, a former mayor of the Bosnian town of Prijedor, was apparently done without telling the Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, a democratic Serbian nationalist and fierce critic of the Hague. The divisions in Belgrade over Mr Milosevic and war crimes were highlighted this week when Mr Kostunica blasted the conduct of the officials and said Mr Stakic's extradition was illegal under Yugoslav law. Belgrade is promising a new bill on cooperation with the Hague but that could take months to become law. Western officials say Belgrade is dragging things out on purpose. Referring to Bosnian Serbs, the Yugoslav government has announced that anyone charged with war crimes and not a Yugoslav citizen is now unwelcome in Serbia. Asked if that meant that the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic would be detained if he returned to Belgrade, an official said he took out citizenship in 1993.",

Young black opposition activists and white farmers have been recruited for the operation, due to begin this weekend using a combination of modern technology and mountain bikes. The aim is to deliver news critical of the regime into rural areas where the ruling Zanu-PF party has in effect banned opposition newspapers and the only source of information is the state-controlled radio. Topper Whitehead, the white retired mining engineer running the scheme, said the equipment was donated or lent by people \"well-wishers\". \"There's a lot of well-wishers around.

The British high commission in Harare denies that the UK is officially involved in the operation, but Mr Whitehead has been in regular contact with one of its members, a man regarded by the diplomatic community as an intelligence officer. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is keeping its distance for the present, in part because Mr Mugabe could exploit such foreign involvement to embarrass his opponents.

      "body": "<p>When William Hague launched the Tories' bid for Downing Street earlier this month with his controversial \"journey to a foreign land\" speech, there was one young woman in the audience who was particularly attentive. She stood out a mile. A blonde woman, dressed in a black trouser suit, with long straight hair and a toothy smile. She sat bolt upright in the second row of the audience, hands resting demurely on her lap, chin uplifted, eyes front.</p> <p>This woman looked stylish, modern, professional - yet here she was, at one of the least promising dates in the political calendar, the Conservative Party's Spring Forum in Harrogate. She applauded on cue, she laughed in all the right places, and when the time came, she leapt to her feet for the obligatory standing ovation.</p> <p>As the applause rippled around the auditorium, the shaven figure on the podium lifted a hand to shield his eyes from the stage lights and searched among the faces below; there he spotted her, summoned her, and led her to the front of the platform. A collective sigh of contentment went up from the floor. It was Ffion, the Tory leader's partner of three years and the perfect political wife - attractive, discreet, supportive and, most vitally of all, mute.</p> <p>We don't know what Ffion Hague thinks about anything. Not many of us even know what she sounds like, which is a shame because her voice is a delight - deep, dark, smooth, sexy. (\"A fantastic phone-sex voice,\" one political correspondent raved.) Her public life as a political wife is an unilluminating round of Tory fund-raisers and formal engagements, playing second fiddle to her husband, deferring to him, standing behind him, taking care not to upstage. She never does interviews, though she will oblige with the occasional photocall in which she is pictured in an expensive dress next to her husband.</p> <p>It is where her professional and private lives meet that Ffion Hague becomes interesting, and both are enigmatic. By all accounts, extremely competent, ambitious, directed, at age 33 she is building a very successful career as a high-powered, and highly-paid, head-hunter - by its very nature secretive work, conducted in the shadows, where discretion is paramount. And though her private life is the subject of endless political gossip and speculation, it remains a tantalising mystery why this intelligent, attractive young woman ended up marrying the deeply unpopular, uncharismatic William Hague, whose chosen career in politics hangs in the balance. In 10 or 20 years' time, it may be Ffion looking back on her dazzling career and William who will be perceived to have made a brilliant match.</p> <p>It is a frustrating business trying to make direct contact with Ffion Hague. She's the sort of woman, I was told, that you'd like as a friend. Someone who had played with her in the National Youth Orchestra of Wales told me the young Ffion Jenkins had always been a bit square, a bit naff, a bit too earnest to be really good fun, but she was someone who \"had soul\". Which is one of the nicest things you can say about anyone.</p> <p>So the Guardian put in repeated requests with Conservative central office for an interview - the answer was always no. We asked to be put in touch with friends, family and colleagues - they came up with a couple of names of party and professional colleagues. Family were strictly off limits. We asked to be given a list of her public engagements (she does about 100 a year), but even that wasn't forthcoming. In the end, they told me I could see her at Harrogate, where she would be accompanying William for the weekend, but there would be no chats. I was allowed in purely in the capacity of observer, spy, stalker.</p> <p>As it was, she was there for less than 24 hours, the majority of which she spent hidden away in her bedroom amid the swirly-patterned carpets of the Moat House Hotel. She swept into town late Saturday afternoon in a white Range Rover and sailed through reception with a lovely smile for the media and nothing else. Later in the evening, she emerged from her suite for a couple of tightly controlled appearances at fringe meetings, and on Sunday she and William dashed for the Range Rover shortly after 10am, returning mysteriously 20 minutes later. No one would tell us where they were going or when they would be back, though it emerged later they'd been for a stroll in a nearby park.</p> <p>It seemed an extraordinary level of secrecy and paranoia, when a pleasant picture of Ffion and William strolling arm in arm in snowy Yorkshire might have won them a few column inches, if not some votes.</p> <p>Finally, there was the leader's speech, the climax of the weekend. As the faces of modern conservativism were presented grandly to the audience (the biggest cheer reserved, as always, for Ann Widdecombe) the genuinely modern Mrs Hague slipped in unannounced through a side-door, her entry as carefully stage-managed as her husband's - his for maximum impact, hers for minimum. During the ovation, she stood stiffly alongside him holding his hand, her smile sticking drily to her teeth. Then they walked out, hand in hand like children, exchanging pleasantries with party members, and back to the Range Rover, in which they were whisked away like royalty.</p> <p>What did it all reveal? That she is fiercely protective of her own privacy; that she is uncomfortable in front of cameras; that she can work a room like she's been doing it all her life - charming everyone she meets, making middle-aged men go weak at the knees; and that, despite her social ease, three years down the line she is still struggling with her role as political wife. And what an unenviable role it is - all that smiling and deferring to your husband. At one meeting in Harrogate, as Hague addressed Conservative Future (a rowdy group formerly known as the Young Conservatives), Ffion stood on the stage like a reluctant beauty queen, two paces behind William's right shoulder. She did not look happy.</p> <p>It is said that it is Tory central office keeping Ffion reined in. They don't want her doing interviews in case she drops a clanger, or taking centre stage in case she outshines her husband. But everything I heard suggested that it is Ffion who sets the rules for her involvement in the party - no interviews, no speeches, but she will buy an expensive frock and go on William's arm to some dinner.</p> <p>Is that a triumph for feminism? I don't know. Ffion might have maintained her independence in many ways - she has her own professional life and earns perhaps double what her husband makes - but the role she has assumed of glamorous, silent, supportive, adoring wife is still regarded by many as demeaning. She's unwilling to have a voice or develop an independent public role, but still allows herself to be used as a rather intelligent clothes horse to humanise Hague and make him more attractive to voters. The Tories must therefore have been delighted with a recent survey among students which suggested that 70% of heterosexual males would prefer to have a relationship with Ffion than Cherie Blair. (On the other hand, of the gay men questioned, 80% preferred Blair to Hague - but maybe that's a good thing.)</p> <p>\"She's seen as some sort of Conservative-party glamour figure, whose clothes and hair are worthy of comment as if she was Liz Hurley,\" says one old friend. \"I would imagine that for a girl who had very high credibility in terms of intelligence and work and culture, to be portrayed as some sort of blonde bimbo, whose views have not been sought on anything, is the exact inverse of what she had spent most of her life trying to achieve.\"</p> <p>Charlotte Metcalf, who spent months filming the Hagues for her Channel 4 documentary Just William - And Ffion, says Mrs Hague clearly does not feel at ease with this aspect of her role. \"You can see as the car arrives at any event, her face starts to change. One of the reasons she doesn't like it, is she resents having to be the smiling wife, as opposed to being a person in her own right. No one is interested in her as Ffion. They are only interested in her as William's wife. I would hate it. Any modern woman would hate it.\"</p> <p>And with the general election coming up, the pressure on her to support the party effort has increased. After taking advice from friends and colleagues, she is now very much Mrs Ffion Hague, rather than Ms Jenkins, as she used to be known professionally. It has also been announced that she will accompany her husband around the country during the election campaign - last year it was reported that she intended to stay at her desk at Leonard Hull International, the head-hunting company she works for. \"They've worked this out between them,\" says a friend within the Tory party. \"She wants to support him and be with him whenever he needs her, but she's not interested in having a separate political existence. She's much more in the role of Norma Major and Denis Thatcher. Not like Cherie Blair or Hillary Clinton, who have their own political agendas, Ffion sees her role much more as one of support.\"</p> <p>David McDonough, director of Bell Pottinger Consultants, who came to know Ffion when she worked for the arts sponsorship organisation Arts &amp; Business between 1997 and February 2000, and has remained a close friend, was one of the two people I was put in touch with by Ffion's advisers. So this clearly is what she wants people to hear.</p> <p>\"Her view of her role in life - whether it's as a head-hunter or as a politician's wife - is, if it helps and pleases William, then it's right. If it does not help and please him, then it's wrong.\" Which is an interesting statement. Most of us would want to be supportive of our partners, but the idea that something is wrong if it doesn't please or help them seems extreme. McDonough adds: \"I've never seen such unvarnished, undiluted old-fashioned loyalty, not of the stupid and slavish kind, but proper, grown-up, stand-by-your-man kind of loyalty.\"</p> <p>He's right. Such loyalty, such unquestioning devotion, is not fashionable these days, especially not among intelligent, high-achieving, independent young women such as Ffion. But somehow it fits in with what we know of the young Ffion, an earnest, swotty, decent little girl, who always wanted to do the right thing; a talented child who wanted to please her family and live up to their ambitions.</p> <p>Even when she was at primary school she took life very seriously indeed. When other girls were kissing boys behind the bike sheds and listening to Wham!, Ffion Jenkins, dressed in folksy long skirt and prissy blouse, was performing at the Eisteddfod or playing clarinet (brilliantly) in the South Glamorgan Youth Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra of Wales. \"Ffion was really quiet, really coy and very, very square. Relentlessly square,\" says Hannah Griffiths, who played in both orchestras with her. \"She was mousy brown and a bit goofy, but she was incredibly genuine. If you were upset because you couldn't get off with the trombone player you fancied, she would be very nice to you. She's a bit prim, but she's all right, Ffion.\"</p> <p>The younger of two daughters, Ffion Jenkins grew up in the comfortable Cardiff suburb of Rhiwbina. Her family are at the heart of the Welsh establishment - the crachach, or Taffia, memorably described by Kim Howells MP as \"probably the most effective backscratching organisation outside of Sicily\". Her father, Emyr, a former TV presenter, director of the Eisteddfod and chief executive of the Arts Council of Wales, is a leading light in the Welsh-speaking cultural elite. Her mother, Myra, was a Welsh tutor and magistrate.</p> <p>Childhood friends remember Ffion as likeable, hard-working and clever. \"She was possibly the most intelligent person in the school,\" says Richard Grigg, now a prospective parliamentary candidate for Plaid Cymru, who was at Bryntaf primary school with Ffion. \"There was never any doubt she was going to do well for herself.\" From Bryntaf, both Grigg and Ffion went on to Ysgol Gyfun Glantaf, a high-achieving Welsh-speaking comprehensive, where again Ffion was a model pupil. From an early age she was ambitious and serious-minded. In the third form, when her classmates were discussing where to go for a school trip - London or Alton Towers - a straight-faced Ffion suggested a visit to the National Library in Aberystwyth. She left school with three As and a B at A level, plus distinctions in special papers in English and Welsh.</p> <p>It was at Jesus College, Oxford, where she read English, that she began, for the first time, to enjoy a social life that did not revolve solely around her musical and cultural interests. \"She was certainly not a party animal, but in contrast to the goody-goody, swotty image she had before then, she was good fun,\" says one of her contemporaries. She got involved with the Welsh Society and on one now legendary occasion had to be taken to hospital for stitches in her leg after a drunken incident with a ceremonial sword. The soubriquet Jolly Jenkins came after that - compounded by her later membership of a London-based Welsh society called SWS (the Welsh word for kiss and an acronym for Social Welsh &amp; Sexy), which probably sounds saucier than it is.</p> <p>She remained independent and self-contained; she sang in the choir, she had a boyfriend, she studied hard (at Oxford, the view was that she was very bright, but not in the superleague), and after her first degree went on to do a postgraduate course at Aberystwyth university, where she wrote her thesis on the 18th-century poet Thomas Gray.</p> <p>She was - is - an utter perfectionist. She wants to excel; everything she attempts, she does to the best of her ability. In 1991, she joined the fast track of the civil service, where she quickly impressed her bosses, and at the age of 27 became private secretary to the then secretary of state for Wales, John Redwood. She was considered to be so good at her job that she was seen as future permanent secretary material. It was then that she transformed herself from mousy brown to blonde. Her make-over was effective, but not dramatic; look closely at her today - she's attractive, but there's still a slight schoolgirl goofiness about her face, and it's all the more interesting for it.</p> <p>It wasn't just Ffion who excelled in the Jenkins family. Her older sister, Manon, was a tough act to follow. \"There was some competition between them,\" says an old family friend. Both were talented musically; Manon went to Cambridge, where she subsequently did her PhD; Ffion went to Oxford. Emyr Jenkins, proud of his high-achieving daughters, would say a bit pompously: \"Let's put it this way, it doesn't matter in our house who wins the boat race.\" To his delight, at one stage while Ffion was working for the secretary of state for Wales, Manon was working for the Prince of Wales as his assistant private secretary. Between them they pretty well had Wales sewn up. When Ffion said she was getting married to Redwood's successor at the Welsh Office, Manon reportedly said to her parents, \"Oh well, that's the end of sibling rivalry.\" The story of Ffion and William's courtship tells you something about both of them.</p> <p>It began with a gorgeous day in the hot summer of 1995, on the wall of a churchyard in the shadow of Snowdonia. They were on a tour of Wales, it was just starting to get dark, and for two hours Ffion sang the Welsh national anthem to him, over and over and over again in order to avoid him suffering the embarrassment Redwood had experienced by not knowing the words. It took Hague a year to ask her out; they conducted their relationship in secret and within four months, to many people's surprise, they were engaged.</p> <p>There's an entertaining story about how Hague hosted a drinks party at the Welsh Office before their relationship was public knowledge. At the end of it, Ffion was naturally keen to find out what friends of hers attending the party thought of him. They told her they liked him very much, particularly one gay friend, who confided: \"He's obviously batting from my side.\" Shortly afterwards, the engagement was announced, much to the friend's embarrassment. Ffion took a sabbatical; she never returned to the civil service but made a career change, pursuing her passion for the arts as a director of Arts &amp; Business. And the couple got married.</p> <p>Kate Jennings, Ffion's boss at the Welsh Office, offered an insight shortly before the marriage: \"I can say candidly that she is ambitious as well as clever. She is not a naive girl who has been swept off her feet. I don't believe this was a passionate affair. They like each other, but it would be a bit much to describe their relationship as a great love match.</p> <p>\"Ffion is charming, a very nice woman - extremely capable and not to be underestimated. Her political judgment was not particularly developed at the Welsh Office. Even so, she did not strike me as a natural Tory. She's a Blairite more than anything else. England offers her more than Wales did, and marriage to William Hague offers even more. She finds this terribly exciting.\"</p> <p>It's hardly the stuff of great romance, but neither are many other marriages. Nevertheless, the relationship has been dogged by rumour and speculation. It's not helped by Ffion's obsessive privacy and the spinning that goes on, the anecdotes about Ffion and William, wrapped around each other in a smoky corner of a London jazz club; passionate kisses in the gardens surrounding their Dolphin Square flat, around which - journalists are told repeatedly - they pad barefoot, glasses of red wine in hand, laughing ceaselessly. It may all be true, but to those with suspicious minds it all sounds a little staged.</p> <p>Yet everyone I spoke to who had some degree of intimacy with the Hagues testified to the genuineness of the relationship. Those who did not know them well were the ones who voiced doubts. Metcalf, who spent months filming them, was convinced by what she saw. \"She thinks he has the most fantastic brain. They are very, very similar. They have a very similar sense of humour. They have very similar interests. They are real soul mates. All the time we were filming, they could not wait to see each other. They're quite touchy-feely. Always, in the back of the car, they were giggling and whispering. I think they're like brother and sister. They just really, really like each other.\" The brother-sister analogy was echoed by others who have seen them from close quarters. Another one-time friend of the couple said: \"The relationship I witnessed was a full-on, affectionate, jealous relationship. She was jealous of the people who reduced the amount of time she spent with her husband.\"</p> <p>Unlike most senior political figures, Hague sets aside Sundays to spend with his wife at their home in Catterick, north Yorkshire, and no one is allowed to interrupt that time without very good reason. They try to spend as many evenings a week together as possible, they take more holidays than most - they travel to America at least once a year and have recently discovered Spain. Another journalist unexpectedly came across them in an otherwise deserted hotel in the Brecon Beacons where they were weekending - they looked engrossed, involved, deep in conversation.</p> <p>\"Whatever one says about this marriage - that it's a kind of show marriage, or cover for other things - they really do seek out a lot of time to be together,\" says Metcalf. \"If it was a show marriage, there wouldn't be any need to be going off constantly for weekends in Spain or to Yorkshire.\" On one occasion, Metcalf recalls Ffion spending eight hours travelling to Yorkshire just to spend a single day with him.</p> <p>Filming was a tricky business - interestingly, it was Ffion who did all the negotiating, not William. \"There were so many rules. At the beginning there was no way she was going to be in it at all. It was a matter of slowly, slowly, slowly convincing her to do it. She did not want any filming of her on her own. If you overstep the line, she can be very frosty. She's very calm about it. Quite icy.\"</p> <p>In one hilarious scene, the Hagues were filmed on a country walk dressed in identical hiking gear. \"I came down from my hotel room and there were Pinky and Perky with their walking sticks. Part of you wants to weep, but it's really sweet in another way.\" And there was an extraordinary moment when Metcalf asked Ffion whether it had been love at first sight. \"It seemed to me an absolutely anodyne question,\" says Metcalf. \"But she really, really resented it.\" Plainly taken aback, Ffion replied frostily: \"You can't ask questions like that.\" Hague tried to placate her, patting her affectionately on the knee but it was hard for them to disguise how upset she was by the intrusion. \"She did look a little ill at ease and a bit cross on occasions during the film,\" agrees McDonough. \"There were awkward moments. She will not discuss her private life. She's frankly too private and too dignified a person to want to go into all that.\"</p> <p>But not too dignified to play along with an ill-conceived Tory central office stunt in July 1999 involving a \u00a31,500 diamond-encrusted pendant in the shape of a pound sign. It was supposed to be a gift from a husband to his wife - but was exposed as a crass attempt to exploit William and Ffion's relationship to improve his public image, while simultaneously using her as a walking advertisement for his campaign to keep the pound ahead of the European elections. The pendant was commissioned by the head of the Conservative media unit and Hague's chief spindoctor, Amanda Platell - who is also a friend of Ffion. Platell even had to pay for the pendant after the jeweller complained the bill had not been settled and the romantic Mr Hague had to pay her back. Not nice. The debacle did little to subdue speculation that the marriage was less a love match than one of political expediency.</p> <p>Ffion's friends play down the incident. \"She still wears it,\" one girlfriend told me. \"She says people are disappointed if she doesn't get it out occasionally. In any case, she ended up with some very nice diamonds.\" But it's hard to imagine Ffion dismissing such a tawdry little mess so easily. This is someone who takes herself and her image very seriously. She will know how damaging such publicity can be - not just for William and the Tory party but for her, too. Professionally, she has a lot to lose - she will not want her career prospects damaged by the ineptitude of either her husband or the Tories' media machine.</p> <p>Similarly, two years earlier, at the Tory party conference, she came a cropper when over-excited spindoctors briefed the media that the then Ms Jenkins would be wearing a stunning, diaphanous dress by a top designer. The waiting press corps were expecting something akin to that Liz Hurley safety-pin moment; instead, Ffion appeared in a nice, but rather ordinary, black lace dress which led to unflattering observations about her figure. It wasn't the dress that was the mistake, it was the spinning - without it, photographers would have taken some pictures of Mr Hague's fianc\u008ee and would have left quite happy.</p> <p>That seems to have been a turning point for Ffion in her role as wife of the leader of the opposition. Stung by the personal criticisms, she seemed to disappear from public view, re-emerging with much greater control of her image. If she makes mistakes, she wants to make her own. \"She certainly does have a good angle on the press and how she wants to control the people around her,\" said one former friend. \"She's slightly prima donna-ish about the way her image is preserved, in the way you imagine Princess Diana to have been. She almost cultivates that not-being-seen image. It's probably quite well thought out. She wants to create a mystique.\"</p> <p>The same acquaintance, who did not want to be named, also alluded to Ffion's influence over Hague. \"It was always made clear that in order to get things past William you kind of had to have a passport from her. If you were trying to convert William to think about things, you had to be acceptable to her.\"</p> <p>The female \"power-behind-the-throne\" theory is seductive, but unlike Hillary and Cherie, Ffion is not a political animal. She may have been involved in Operation Hague to overhaul her husband's fuddy-duddy image, but she has no political record of her own; she was never involved in student politics (which at the time of their engagement was seen by senior party officials as a stroke of luck), and you can't imagine her discussing with her husband into the wee small hours the finer points of the Tories' health policy.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine what they discuss at all, but just by virtue of her background and Welshness, it's easy to see there may be political differences - for example, Hague opposed devolution, which she must have been bound to support. Contemporaries who were with her at Oxford find it hard to believe that the liberal-minded undergraduate they knew feels comfortable with some of the more extreme views of the modern Tory party and its leader. And a couple of sources suggested that at one time Ffion considered becoming a Liberal Democrat. \"It's complete rubbish,\" a close friend said. \"It was a friend who approached her. She considered it out of courtesy. But her instincts are very much like William's. She's a small c conservative. Her instincts are Tory.\"</p> <p>What of the future? What of Ffion and William if the Tories are crushed at the election; what happens if Hague fails to eat into Blair's majority in any convincing way and is ousted in a leadership battle? \"There are people who don't think she'll stick with him after the election,\" said one friend from Cardiff.</p> <p>\"I think there's more to the relationship than the chance of a ticket to number 10.\" So do I. Professionally the clever Mrs Hague has been planning ahead. She has already had two successful careers, in the civil service and the world of arts and business sponsorship. She is now on to her third as a head-hunter, is earning mega-bucks (reportedly anything up to \u00a3250,000 a year) and is said to be thriving. It is in her work that her talent for organisation, her decisiveness, her charm person-to person, are most effective; it is the public performer aspects of political life that suit her less well. \"She's found a new spring in her step and a new confidence and certainty about herself,\" says her friend McDonough. And it isn't just something she has stumbled into as a career - every step Ffion Hague takes, whether it's professionally or personally, is carefully considered. You can count on it. \"She's quite a serious and thoughtful person who would look at her own career development and personal growth quite intensely, more intensely than a lot of people might. The steps she has taken have been part of a quite carefully thought out progression,\" says McDonough.</p> <p>Politically, however, the future is grim for the Hagues. She can only hope that her own stock is not damaged by her husband's fate at the polls. \"She must have taken a fairly realistic look at what's likely to happen,\" saysMcDonough. \"She's mature enough and confident enough, both in herself and in her relationship with William to be quite philosophical about the changing fortunes of politics. It might reduce the extent of her public profile, but I think she would probably be quite relieved to be able to get on with her own life without people looking at where she bought her last dress or suit or whatever.\" And presumably she won't miss the weekly call by lobby correspondents enquiring whether she is pregnant yet.\"</p> <p>Whatever happens to William, Ffion Hague's future looks bright, but then it always did - long before that late summer's evening, in the foothills of Snowdonia, singing to the young politician who looked set for stardom. At the time of their engagement, it might have looked as if the ambitious, young civil servant from Cardiff was bettering herself. These days, it's the other way round and William Hague will be desperately hoping that his wife's golden touch might rub off on him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When William Hague launched the Tories' bid for Downing Street earlier this month with his controversial \"journey to a foreign land\" speech, there was one young woman in the audience who was particularly attentive. She stood out a mile. A blonde woman, dressed in a black trouser suit, with long straight hair and a toothy smile. She sat bolt upright in the second row of the audience, hands resting demurely on her lap, chin uplifted, eyes front. This woman looked stylish, modern, professional - yet here she was, at one of the least promising dates in the political calendar, the Conservative Party's Spring Forum in Harrogate. She applauded on cue, she laughed in all the right places, and when the time came, she leapt to her feet for the obligatory standing ovation. As the applause rippled around the auditorium, the shaven figure on the podium lifted a hand to shield his eyes from the stage lights and searched among the faces below; there he spotted her, summoned her, and led her to the front of the platform. A collective sigh of contentment went up from the floor. It was Ffion, the Tory leader's partner of three years and the perfect political wife - attractive, discreet, supportive and, most vitally of all, mute. We don't know what Ffion Hague thinks about anything. Not many of us even know what she sounds like, which is a shame because her voice is a delight - deep, dark, smooth, sexy. (\"A fantastic phone-sex voice,\" one political correspondent raved.) Her public life as a political wife is an unilluminating round of Tory fund-raisers and formal engagements, playing second fiddle to her husband, deferring to him, standing behind him, taking care not to upstage. She never does interviews, though she will oblige with the occasional photocall in which she is pictured in an expensive dress next to her husband. It is where her professional and private lives meet that Ffion Hague becomes interesting, and both are enigmatic. By all accounts, extremely competent, ambitious, directed, at age 33 she is building a very successful career as a high-powered, and highly-paid, head-hunter - by its very nature secretive work, conducted in the shadows, where discretion is paramount. And though her private life is the subject of endless political gossip and speculation, it remains a tantalising mystery why this intelligent, attractive young woman ended up marrying the deeply unpopular, uncharismatic William Hague, whose chosen career in politics hangs in the balance. In 10 or 20 years' time, it may be Ffion looking back on her dazzling career and William who will be perceived to have made a brilliant match. It is a frustrating business trying to make direct contact with Ffion Hague. She's the sort of woman, I was told, that you'd like as a friend. Someone who had played with her in the National Youth Orchestra of Wales told me the young Ffion Jenkins had always been a bit square, a bit naff, a bit too earnest to be really good fun, but she was someone who \"had soul\". Which is one of the nicest things you can say about anyone. So the Guardian put in repeated requests with Conservative central office for an interview - the answer was always no. We asked to be put in touch with friends, family and colleagues - they came up with a couple of names of party and professional colleagues. Family were strictly off limits. We asked to be given a list of her public engagements (she does about 100 a year), but even that wasn't forthcoming. In the end, they told me I could see her at Harrogate, where she would be accompanying William for the weekend, but there would be no chats. I was allowed in purely in the capacity of observer, spy, stalker. As it was, she was there for less than 24 hours, the majority of which she spent hidden away in her bedroom amid the swirly-patterned carpets of the Moat House Hotel. She swept into town late Saturday afternoon in a white Range Rover and sailed through reception with a lovely smile for the media and nothing else. Later in the evening, she emerged from her suite for a couple of tightly controlled appearances at fringe meetings, and on Sunday she and William dashed for the Range Rover shortly after 10am, returning mysteriously 20 minutes later. No one would tell us where they were going or when they would be back, though it emerged later they'd been for a stroll in a nearby park. It seemed an extraordinary level of secrecy and paranoia, when a pleasant picture of Ffion and William strolling arm in arm in snowy Yorkshire might have won them a few column inches, if not some votes. Finally, there was the leader's speech, the climax of the weekend. As the faces of modern conservativism were presented grandly to the audience (the biggest cheer reserved, as always, for Ann Widdecombe) the genuinely modern Mrs Hague slipped in unannounced through a side-door, her entry as carefully stage-managed as her husband's - his for maximum impact, hers for minimum. During the ovation, she stood stiffly alongside him holding his hand, her smile sticking drily to her teeth. Then they walked out, hand in hand like children, exchanging pleasantries with party members, and back to the Range Rover, in which they were whisked away like royalty. What did it all reveal? That she is fiercely protective of her own privacy; that she is uncomfortable in front of cameras; that she can work a room like she's been doing it all her life - charming everyone she meets, making middle-aged men go weak at the knees; and that, despite her social ease, three years down the line she is still struggling with her role as political wife. And what an unenviable role it is - all that smiling and deferring to your husband. At one meeting in Harrogate, as Hague addressed Conservative Future (a rowdy group formerly known as the Young Conservatives), Ffion stood on the stage like a reluctant beauty queen, two paces behind William's right shoulder. She did not look happy. It is said that it is Tory central office keeping Ffion reined in. They don't want her doing interviews in case she drops a clanger, or taking centre stage in case she outshines her husband. But everything I heard suggested that it is Ffion who sets the rules for her involvement in the party - no interviews, no speeches, but she will buy an expensive frock and go on William's arm to some dinner. Is that a triumph for feminism? I don't know. Ffion might have maintained her independence in many ways - she has her own professional life and earns perhaps double what her husband makes - but the role she has assumed of glamorous, silent, supportive, adoring wife is still regarded by many as demeaning. She's unwilling to have a voice or develop an independent public role, but still allows herself to be used as a rather intelligent clothes horse to humanise Hague and make him more attractive to voters. The Tories must therefore have been delighted with a recent survey among students which suggested that 70% of heterosexual males would prefer to have a relationship with Ffion than Cherie Blair. (On the other hand, of the gay men questioned, 80% preferred Blair to Hague - but maybe that's a good thing.) \"She's seen as some sort of Conservative-party glamour figure, whose clothes and hair are worthy of comment as if she was Liz Hurley,\" says one old friend. \"I would imagine that for a girl who had very high credibility in terms of intelligence and work and culture, to be portrayed as some sort of blonde bimbo, whose views have not been sought on anything, is the exact inverse of what she had spent most of her life trying to achieve.\" Charlotte Metcalf, who spent months filming the Hagues for her Channel 4 documentary Just William - And Ffion, says Mrs Hague clearly does not feel at ease with this aspect of her role. \"You can see as the car arrives at any event, her face starts to change. One of the reasons she doesn't like it, is she resents having to be the smiling wife, as opposed to being a person in her own right. No one is interested in her as Ffion. They are only interested in her as William's wife. I would hate it. Any modern woman would hate it.\" And with the general election coming up, the pressure on her to support the party effort has increased. After taking advice from friends and colleagues, she is now very much Mrs Ffion Hague, rather than Ms Jenkins, as she used to be known professionally. It has also been announced that she will accompany her husband around the country during the election campaign - last year it was reported that she intended to stay at her desk at Leonard Hull International, the head-hunting company she works for. \"They've worked this out between them,\" says a friend within the Tory party. \"She wants to support him and be with him whenever he needs her, but she's not interested in having a separate political existence. She's much more in the role of Norma Major and Denis Thatcher. Not like Cherie Blair or Hillary Clinton, who have their own political agendas, Ffion sees her role much more as one of support.\" David McDonough, director of Bell Pottinger Consultants, who came to know Ffion when she worked for the arts sponsorship organisation Arts &amp; Business between 1997 and February 2000, and has remained a close friend, was one of the two people I was put in touch with by Ffion's advisers. So this clearly is what she wants people to hear. \"Her view of her role in life - whether it's as a head-hunter or as a politician's wife - is, if it helps and pleases William, then it's right. If it does not help and please him, then it's wrong.\" Which is an interesting statement. Most of us would want to be supportive of our partners, but the idea that something is wrong if it doesn't please or help them seems extreme. McDonough adds: \"I've never seen such unvarnished, undiluted old-fashioned loyalty, not of the stupid and slavish kind, but proper, grown-up, stand-by-your-man kind of loyalty.\" He's right. Such loyalty, such unquestioning devotion, is not fashionable these days, especially not among intelligent, high-achieving, independent young women such as Ffion. But somehow it fits in with what we know of the young Ffion, an earnest, swotty, decent little girl, who always wanted to do the right thing; a talented child who wanted to please her family and live up to their ambitions. Even when she was at primary school she took life very seriously indeed. When other girls were kissing boys behind the bike sheds and listening to Wham!, Ffion Jenkins, dressed in folksy long skirt and prissy blouse, was performing at the Eisteddfod or playing clarinet (brilliantly) in the South Glamorgan Youth Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra of Wales. \"Ffion was really quiet, really coy and very, very square. Relentlessly square,\" says Hannah Griffiths, who played in both orchestras with her. \"She was mousy brown and a bit goofy, but she was incredibly genuine. If you were upset because you couldn't get off with the trombone player you fancied, she would be very nice to you. She's a bit prim, but she's all right, Ffion.\" The younger of two daughters, Ffion Jenkins grew up in the comfortable Cardiff suburb of Rhiwbina. Her family are at the heart of the Welsh establishment - the crachach, or Taffia, memorably described by Kim Howells MP as \"probably the most effective backscratching organisation outside of Sicily\". Her father, Emyr, a former TV presenter, director of the Eisteddfod and chief executive of the Arts Council of Wales, is a leading light in the Welsh-speaking cultural elite. Her mother, Myra, was a Welsh tutor and magistrate. Childhood friends remember Ffion as likeable, hard-working and clever. \"She was possibly the most intelligent person in the school,\" says Richard Grigg, now a prospective parliamentary candidate for Plaid Cymru, who was at Bryntaf primary school with Ffion. \"There was never any doubt she was going to do well for herself.\" From Bryntaf, both Grigg and Ffion went on to Ysgol Gyfun Glantaf, a high-achieving Welsh-speaking comprehensive, where again Ffion was a model pupil. From an early age she was ambitious and serious-minded. In the third form, when her classmates were discussing where to go for a school trip - London or Alton Towers - a straight-faced Ffion suggested a visit to the National Library in Aberystwyth. She left school with three As and a B at A level, plus distinctions in special papers in English and Welsh. It was at Jesus College, Oxford, where she read English, that she began, for the first time, to enjoy a social life that did not revolve solely around her musical and cultural interests. \"She was certainly not a party animal, but in contrast to the goody-goody, swotty image she had before then, she was good fun,\" says one of her contemporaries. She got involved with the Welsh Society and on one now legendary occasion had to be taken to hospital for stitches in her leg after a drunken incident with a ceremonial sword. The soubriquet Jolly Jenkins came after that - compounded by her later membership of a London-based Welsh society called SWS (the Welsh word for kiss and an acronym for Social Welsh &amp; Sexy), which probably sounds saucier than it is. She remained independent and self-contained; she sang in the choir, she had a boyfriend, she studied hard (at Oxford, the view was that she was very bright, but not in the superleague), and after her first degree went on to do a postgraduate course at Aberystwyth university, where she wrote her thesis on the 18th-century poet Thomas Gray. She was - is - an utter perfectionist. She wants to excel; everything she attempts, she does to the best of her ability. In 1991, she joined the fast track of the civil service, where she quickly impressed her bosses, and at the age of 27 became private secretary to the then secretary of state for Wales, John Redwood. She was considered to be so good at her job that she was seen as future permanent secretary material. It was then that she transformed herself from mousy brown to blonde. Her make-over was effective, but not dramatic; look closely at her today - she's attractive, but there's still a slight schoolgirl goofiness about her face, and it's all the more interesting for it. It wasn't just Ffion who excelled in the Jenkins family. Her older sister, Manon, was a tough act to follow. \"There was some competition between them,\" says an old family friend. Both were talented musically; Manon went to Cambridge, where she subsequently did her PhD; Ffion went to Oxford. Emyr Jenkins, proud of his high-achieving daughters, would say a bit pompously: \"Let's put it this way, it doesn't matter in our house who wins the boat race.\" To his delight, at one stage while Ffion was working for the secretary of state for Wales, Manon was working for the Prince of Wales as his assistant private secretary. Between them they pretty well had Wales sewn up. When Ffion said she was getting married to Redwood's successor at the Welsh Office, Manon reportedly said to her parents, \"Oh well, that's the end of sibling rivalry.\" The story of Ffion and William's courtship tells you something about both of them. It began with a gorgeous day in the hot summer of 1995, on the wall of a churchyard in the shadow of Snowdonia. They were on a tour of Wales, it was just starting to get dark, and for two hours Ffion sang the Welsh national anthem to him, over and over and over again in order to avoid him suffering the embarrassment Redwood had experienced by not knowing the words. It took Hague a year to ask her out; they conducted their relationship in secret and within four months, to many people's surprise, they were engaged. There's an entertaining story about how Hague hosted a drinks party at the Welsh Office before their relationship was public knowledge. At the end of it, Ffion was naturally keen to find out what friends of hers attending the party thought of him. They told her they liked him very much, particularly one gay friend, who confided: \"He's obviously batting from my side.\" Shortly afterwards, the engagement was announced, much to the friend's embarrassment. Ffion took a sabbatical; she never returned to the civil service but made a career change, pursuing her passion for the arts as a director of Arts &amp; Business. And the couple got married. Kate Jennings, Ffion's boss at the Welsh Office, offered an insight shortly before the marriage: \"I can say candidly that she is ambitious as well as clever. She is not a naive girl who has been swept off her feet. I don't believe this was a passionate affair. They like each other, but it would be a bit much to describe their relationship as a great love match. \"Ffion is charming, a very nice woman - extremely capable and not to be underestimated. Her political judgment was not particularly developed at the Welsh Office. Even so, she did not strike me as a natural Tory. She's a Blairite more than anything else. England offers her more than Wales did, and marriage to William Hague offers even more. She finds this terribly exciting.\" It's hardly the stuff of great romance, but neither are many other marriages. Nevertheless, the relationship has been dogged by rumour and speculation. It's not helped by Ffion's obsessive privacy and the spinning that goes on, the anecdotes about Ffion and William, wrapped around each other in a smoky corner of a London jazz club; passionate kisses in the gardens surrounding their Dolphin Square flat, around which - journalists are told repeatedly - they pad barefoot, glasses of red wine in hand, laughing ceaselessly. It may all be true, but to those with suspicious minds it all sounds a little staged. Yet everyone I spoke to who had some degree of intimacy with the Hagues testified to the genuineness of the relationship. Those who did not know them well were the ones who voiced doubts. Metcalf, who spent months filming them, was convinced by what she saw. \"She thinks he has the most fantastic brain. They are very, very similar. They have a very similar sense of humour. They have very similar interests. They are real soul mates. All the time we were filming, they could not wait to see each other. They're quite touchy-feely. Always, in the back of the car, they were giggling and whispering. I think they're like brother and sister. They just really, really like each other.\" The brother-sister analogy was echoed by others who have seen them from close quarters. Another one-time friend of the couple said: \"The relationship I witnessed was a full-on, affectionate, jealous relationship. She was jealous of the people who reduced the amount of time she spent with her husband.\" Unlike most senior political figures, Hague sets aside Sundays to spend with his wife at their home in Catterick, north Yorkshire, and no one is allowed to interrupt that time without very good reason. They try to spend as many evenings a week together as possible, they take more holidays than most - they travel to America at least once a year and have recently discovered Spain. Another journalist unexpectedly came across them in an otherwise deserted hotel in the Brecon Beacons where they were weekending - they looked engrossed, involved, deep in conversation. \"Whatever one says about this marriage - that it's a kind of show marriage, or cover for other things - they really do seek out a lot of time to be together,\" says Metcalf. \"If it was a show marriage, there wouldn't be any need to be going off constantly for weekends in Spain or to Yorkshire.\" On one occasion, Metcalf recalls Ffion spending eight hours travelling to Yorkshire just to spend a single day with him. Filming was a tricky business - interestingly, it was Ffion who did all the negotiating, not William. \"There were so many rules. At the beginning there was no way she was going to be in it at all. It was a matter of slowly, slowly, slowly convincing her to do it. She did not want any filming of her on her own. If you overstep the line, she can be very frosty. She's very calm about it. Quite icy.\" In one hilarious scene, the Hagues were filmed on a country walk dressed in identical hiking gear. \"I came down from my hotel room and there were Pinky and Perky with their walking sticks. Part of you wants to weep, but it's really sweet in another way.\" And there was an extraordinary moment when Metcalf asked Ffion whether it had been love at first sight. \"It seemed to me an absolutely anodyne question,\" says Metcalf. \"But she really, really resented it.\" Plainly taken aback, Ffion replied frostily: \"You can't ask questions like that.\" Hague tried to placate her, patting her affectionately on the knee but it was hard for them to disguise how upset she was by the intrusion. \"She did look a little ill at ease and a bit cross on occasions during the film,\" agrees McDonough. \"There were awkward moments. She will not discuss her private life. She's frankly too private and too dignified a person to want to go into all that.\" But not too dignified to play along with an ill-conceived Tory central office stunt in July 1999 involving a \u00a31,500 diamond-encrusted pendant in the shape of a pound sign. It was supposed to be a gift from a husband to his wife - but was exposed as a crass attempt to exploit William and Ffion's relationship to improve his public image, while simultaneously using her as a walking advertisement for his campaign to keep the pound ahead of the European elections. The pendant was commissioned by the head of the Conservative media unit and Hague's chief spindoctor, Amanda Platell - who is also a friend of Ffion. Platell even had to pay for the pendant after the jeweller complained the bill had not been settled and the romantic Mr Hague had to pay her back. Not nice. The debacle did little to subdue speculation that the marriage was less a love match than one of political expediency. Ffion's friends play down the incident. \"She still wears it,\" one girlfriend told me. \"She says people are disappointed if she doesn't get it out occasionally. In any case, she ended up with some very nice diamonds.\" But it's hard to imagine Ffion dismissing such a tawdry little mess so easily. This is someone who takes herself and her image very seriously. She will know how damaging such publicity can be - not just for William and the Tory party but for her, too. Professionally, she has a lot to lose - she will not want her career prospects damaged by the ineptitude of either her husband or the Tories' media machine. Similarly, two years earlier, at the Tory party conference, she came a cropper when over-excited spindoctors briefed the media that the then Ms Jenkins would be wearing a stunning, diaphanous dress by a top designer. The waiting press corps were expecting something akin to that Liz Hurley safety-pin moment; instead, Ffion appeared in a nice, but rather ordinary, black lace dress which led to unflattering observations about her figure. It wasn't the dress that was the mistake, it was the spinning - without it, photographers would have taken some pictures of Mr Hague's fianc\u008ee and would have left quite happy. That seems to have been a turning point for Ffion in her role as wife of the leader of the opposition. Stung by the personal criticisms, she seemed to disappear from public view, re-emerging with much greater control of her image. If she makes mistakes, she wants to make her own. \"She certainly does have a good angle on the press and how she wants to control the people around her,\" said one former friend. \"She's slightly prima donna-ish about the way her image is preserved, in the way you imagine Princess Diana to have been. She almost cultivates that not-being-seen image. It's probably quite well thought out. She wants to create a mystique.\" The same acquaintance, who did not want to be named, also alluded to Ffion's influence over Hague. \"It was always made clear that in order to get things past William you kind of had to have a passport from her. If you were trying to convert William to think about things, you had to be acceptable to her.\" The female \"power-behind-the-throne\" theory is seductive, but unlike Hillary and Cherie, Ffion is not a political animal. She may have been involved in Operation Hague to overhaul her husband's fuddy-duddy image, but she has no political record of her own; she was never involved in student politics (which at the time of their engagement was seen by senior party officials as a stroke of luck), and you can't imagine her discussing with her husband into the wee small hours the finer points of the Tories' health policy. It's hard to imagine what they discuss at all, but just by virtue of her background and Welshness, it's easy to see there may be political differences - for example, Hague opposed devolution, which she must have been bound to support. Contemporaries who were with her at Oxford find it hard to believe that the liberal-minded undergraduate they knew feels comfortable with some of the more extreme views of the modern Tory party and its leader. And a couple of sources suggested that at one time Ffion considered becoming a Liberal Democrat. \"It's complete rubbish,\" a close friend said. \"It was a friend who approached her. She considered it out of courtesy. But her instincts are very much like William's. She's a small c conservative. Her instincts are Tory.\" What of the future? What of Ffion and William if the Tories are crushed at the election; what happens if Hague fails to eat into Blair's majority in any convincing way and is ousted in a leadership battle? \"There are people who don't think she'll stick with him after the election,\" said one friend from Cardiff. \"I think there's more to the relationship than the chance of a ticket to number 10.\" So do I. Professionally the clever Mrs Hague has been planning ahead. She has already had two successful careers, in the civil service and the world of arts and business sponsorship. She is now on to her third as a head-hunter, is earning mega-bucks (reportedly anything up to \u00a3250,000 a year) and is said to be thriving. It is in her work that her talent for organisation, her decisiveness, her charm person-to person, are most effective; it is the public performer aspects of political life that suit her less well. \"She's found a new spring in her step and a new confidence and certainty about herself,\" says her friend McDonough. And it isn't just something she has stumbled into as a career - every step Ffion Hague takes, whether it's professionally or personally, is carefully considered. You can count on it. \"She's quite a serious and thoughtful person who would look at her own career development and personal growth quite intensely, more intensely than a lot of people might. The steps she has taken have been part of a quite carefully thought out progression,\" says McDonough. Politically, however, the future is grim for the Hagues. She can only hope that her own stock is not damaged by her husband's fate at the polls. \"She must have taken a fairly realistic look at what's likely to happen,\" saysMcDonough. \"She's mature enough and confident enough, both in herself and in her relationship with William to be quite philosophical about the changing fortunes of politics. It might reduce the extent of her public profile, but I think she would probably be quite relieved to be able to get on with her own life without people looking at where she bought her last dress or suit or whatever.\" And presumably she won't miss the weekly call by lobby correspondents enquiring whether she is pregnant yet.\" Whatever happens to William, Ffion Hague's future looks bright, but then it always did - long before that late summer's evening, in the foothills of Snowdonia, singing to the young politician who looked set for stardom. At the time of their engagement, it might have looked as if the ambitious, young civil servant from Cardiff was bettering herself. These days, it's the other way round and William Hague will be desperately hoping that his wife's golden touch might rub off on him.",
